YOUNG LOVE
PART I
CHAPTER I
? Once upon a time ? there had come to a
certain New South Wales station a small brown
man with a boy of five. The boy was very
pretty, and very thin, and very hungry, and the
lady of the house, the squatter?s wife, had a
tender heart and was voung.
J O
It happened that she was in the storehouse
watching her husband weigh sugar rations for
O O O
the station hands?for in those days they had no
storekeeper?when two shadows from without
fell at her feet. She looked up laughing ?and
there was that small child-face in the doorway,
eager and pinched and thin?and away behind
a great stack of candles, playing with small heaps
of stores, her own boy, fat and rosy and merry.
That it was that did it all?the pitiful contrast.
Demands had immediately been made upon
Richard, the fat, rosy boy. He had bread and
butter, and must share it. He had bed, toys,


clothes, dogs, and all of them must be shared,
half-and-half, fairly and generously.
The full half had not been demanded in the
beginning, only the share that the rich man?s son
should give the poor man?s.
The wanderers had commenced their life on
the station in the kitchen, and were given as a
sleeping apartment a small verandah room that
was once a pantry, but had been forsaken owing
to the raids of the rats.
It had been understood that the next morning
the pair of them would be moving on, tramping it
to another station, on to Sydney. But in the
morning the little boy was prettier and hungrier,
and manifested a dog-like affection for the ?lovely
lady ? who had been good to him. And the
small shabby man had shown an aptitude for
many things ?breaking-in horses, branding cattle,
weighing sugar, keeping books ?and Mr. Allars,
the squatter, had said he might just as well ?stay
on a bit.?
The days ran on until they numbered many
years, and he was there still ?with an indoor
bedroom and a seat at the dining-room table.
Changes came, and many people who had been
on the station went away; but the small brown
man stayed on, for, like many another, he had an
interpretation of his own for staying on ? a bit.?
The woman with the great tender heart, who
had taken the hungry boy in and mothered him
and placed him beside her own boy Bichard, she
had died in the time.
And Richard and the little waif of the


Australian plains had grown up together, taking
life on the half-share system ?only the fatter
and the pleasanter half, in some way, had always
fallen to Selwyn, the stranger?s son. Because
that was the way Mrs. Allars had started it in
the beginning ?? to him that had never had
must be given good measure, pressed down, as
recompense for the years of leanness.?
When the school-days had ended they had
gone into the world together ?to see life,? and
now and again they remembered the two sober
elder ones who were going steadily on building
their bridge of days, on the quiet up-country
run, and they gave them affectionate, patronising
thoughts, contemplating incredulously a time
when they themselves should settle down to just
such an uneventful round of days.
Selwyn had been the first to introduce Woman
into their lives. He found her in a small vicar-
age, doing parish duties, going on Sunday to the
church, and copying out her father?s sermons.
She wore grey clothing, and her face was preter-
naturally grave. Selwyn just then was very
happy sowing wild oats, but some mysterious,
impish affinity drew him to this grave, nun-like
maiden, and bandaged his eyes ?and he realised
straightway how badly he was in need of being
saved.
He laid certain portions of his own and
Richard s life out, for her beautiful eyes to droop
over.
?I?m going to the dogs,? he told her, ?and
only you can stop me.?


He was somewhere about twenty then, and
very proud of his need for being saved.
? Afterwards,? he went on, ? when we are
married, I shall take you into the country and
we?ll settle down. My father and Dick?s are
partners on a station ?but there s no woman in
the house at all. You will be mistress, Ellen.?
? But Dick?s wife ? ? said the nun-like Ellen.
?Oh, Dick?s wife will come later on,? said
Selwyn impetuously. ?First come first served.
When she comes on the scene probably we four
young folks will get the station, and the old men
will settle on a smaller one.?
Felise was almost sixteen when she danced
into Richard?s life. She wore her hair loose
down her back, and her frocks did not reach to
her boot-tops by three inches. She was a dancing
girl then by profession, though she sang songs,
too, and took an occasional unimportant part
when an emergency occurred. When she first
met Richard she was not long out from France,
and was under the impression that she would
soon take the colonies by storm, although her
apprenticeship did not expire until she was
eighteen, and she was only receiving seven and
six a week.
She was perfectly willing to marry Richard
any moment he chose. Her eyes shone with joy
at the mere prospect of matrimony.
?It is what my heart desires ?to be married
at sixteen,? she said.
Richard?s face fell. His boyish heart craved
an admission of love.


? And?to you!? she added rapturously. ?Oh,
Richard, we will make of life a beautiful thing
together. How much money do you get ? I,
alas! can make but little.?
Richard squared his shoulders.
?You will never work again when you have
married me,? he said. ?My father has promised
me �15,000 for a start, and Selwyn and I will
work a station of ours out back.?
The small girl-woman tossed back a strand of
black hair.
? And I to give up my profession ! ? she cried.
?I, who have everything before me ! No, boy,
that cannot be! As well lam promised ?
what you call bound ?for two more years.
? I will see the manager,? said Richard
boldly.
? Alas, no ! He must not know. If he knows
?-I cannot be married at sixteen. Think of it,
boy ! David Bright has me for two more years,
and?ah ! he is a serpent.?
So it fell out, in spite of all his protestations of
valour and fitness to deal with a serpent in the
form of Mr. David Bright, manager of the
Queen s, Richard did not meet him, but stole his
bride and married her when she was sixteen and
he not twenty. And there were present at the
wedding Selwyn and grave-eyed Ellen, who had
been married the day before.
Very soon afterwards, a few hours at most,
Mr. and Mrs. David Bright knew, and Mr.
Allars and the small brown man.
Almost from the beginning Richard and Mr.
O O


Bright were sworn foes, which caused Felise to
weep hysterically.
And Mr. Allars absolutely refused to advance
one penny of the �15,000, or to hear from or see
his son.
And the small brown man said, ? Eh, eh ! ?
and went on with life exactly as if Selwyn had
never been born, or had died long years before.
Then the four young people tossed up proud
heads and went merrily into life.
From the beginning of their married lives they
lived together. Selwyn and Richard were as
brothers, and had grown up together in Richard?s
home almost from their infancy.
They reasoned that their wives would be like
sisters !
In those earliest days, while the wedding-rings
were yet new and shining, they had one sitting-
room and one dining-room. They all sat down to
the one table as one family, though never a drop
of the same blood was in any two of them.
They were like four children playing at house-
keeping, but the ideality of home-life was lacking,
Felise was hot and passionate, Ellen cold and
self-contained ?looking, Felise put it, ?prayers
and fastings all day long.?
Finally, there was a new arrangement. They
were to live as two families in the house where
they had lived as one. Ellen and Selwyn took
the lower floor, and Richard and Felise went
above. But for both women there was only one
kitchen, and the hall and front door belonged to
the two families.


Felise had all manner of spoilt-child tricks,
head-tossings and aggravating ways ; but Ellen
was very patient, and it was difficult to surprise
her into a larger display of temper than slamming
a door. She had habits of scrupulous cleanliness
and neatness.
? Clean the kitchen every day ! ? Felise would
exclaim, with a disdainful curl of her short pretty
lip, ?if you like. For me, unused to such
slavery, once a month will suffice. And the
stairs?if Ido not sweep them ?they are mine.
It is not for you to tread them ! ?
Then she would toss her head and trip away,
her little high-heeled shoes tapping and clicking
upon the bare boards.
Ellen adopted Felise as her cross?it helped to
keep down her hatred and raised her self-respect.
But she shunned her as much as possible.
And later on a small son came to Felise and
Bichard and a daughter to Ellen and Selwyn ;
but instead of bridging the breach as the men so
fondly hoped, this happening only widened it.
The colonies remained coldly distant from
Felise?s feet. Her term with Bright ran out, and
she rose to a prominent position in his company,
and played Juliet and Portia and Rosalind.
But her salary stayed small, and a new little
daughter came to her and Richard, and to both
of the men folk (Selwyn and Richard) work came
but fitfully, and was ill paid.
So the small joint home lost its ideality, and
to two of them the treasures of the world grew
dearer.


CHAPTER II
David Bright sat alone in a little room at the
Queen?s. He was David Bright now, sinister-
looking and with rather a Hebraic cast of counte-
nance. An hour ago he had been a handsome
dying Romeo. An hour ago he had been passion-
torn and despairing?in so far as he had been
able.
Now he was smoking a pipe of retrospection,
with his feet upon the table and his thumbs
stuck into his waistcoat pocket on either side.
Over the back of a neighbouring chair a black
and-white feather boa was hanging. Bright?s
o o o
eyes were fixed upon it reflectively.
It had come from Juliet?s neck. Every feather
was suggestive of Juliet. The faint perfume
that hung about it breathed of Juliet.
He put out his hand and touched it smilelessly.
Then he sat back again and watched it as before.
Outside, the world of Sydney was sinking into
the silence of midnight. Inside and overhead
was the sound of voices and laughter. Upstairs
was Juliet ?jesting. Downstairs Romeo watched
her boa.
Presently along the narrow stone passage there
14


came the sound of a man?s crisp hurrying
footsteps.
Bright sat upright, then, suddenly seizing the
boa, charged out into the passage.
? Ah ! good-evening, Allars,? he said hurriedly.
?This, I believe, is your property.?
He had to hasten his words, for Allars had
almost passed his door when he reached it.
?Queer thing,? he added, ?the individuality of
clothes?that is, when their owners have an
individuality of their own.?
? I?m in a hurry,? said Allars.
Bright leaned upon the door-frame. His
mouth smiled a little.
? Take, for instance, your wife,? he said. ? I
would swear to a gown of hers anywhere?and
the devil himself would know her fal-lals among
a million.?
?I?m in a hurry,? said Allars again, ?and?
confound you.? He jerked ths feathered string,
and it flew from the other man?s shoulder to his
own. Then he made a ring of it and slipped it
over his wrist as he strode down the passage.
The other man?s laugh, mocking and unmusical,
followed him.
He hardly heard it. He walked with his head
very high and his shoulders well thrown back.
At the turning where the passage branched
two ways was a staircase, narrow and dark. It
led to the dressing-rooms.
The Queen?s was not a theatre of which Sydney
made any boast. Stars never trod its boards, and
never yet had any of its plays been trumpeted


forth as ? in the presence of his Excellency the
Governor, Lady Dash and suite.?
Everything behind the scenes was dingy and
squalid, but Allars was familiar with it. At the
staircase-foot he stopped.
He was between two laughs. The one, of the
man he had left, aggravating and mirthless, the
other from overhead, sweet and challenging and
girlish.
But, whereas at the first he had held his head
higher and walked forward, at the second he
drew back to the wall and dropped his chin
down to his breast.
From above came laughter and words and
little snatches of song in a voice of piquancy
and mirth, and slang and stage-talk in voices
masculine and not too refined.
He half turned away, his head still bent, his
hands hanging limply on either side.
Then he stopped and threw back his head.
Some one was coming down the passage towards
him.
? That devil,? he said, under his breath. He
sprang up the stairs rapidly and lightly.
The first doorway gaped darkly. That was
the second ladies? dressing-room.
The next was ablaze with gas-lights, flaring
and unprotected.
The walls were whitewashed, the floors
uncarpeted everything uncouth and dirty-
looking.
The light fell full on Allars? face and almost
dazzled him.


? Felise! ? he said, blinking hard to recover
his sight.
J?L * ?
There was a startled exclamation from the far
side of the room. ?Ma foi; Vepoux.?Well?
you see me.?
? The light,? he said, ?is so strong, Outside it
is dark and raining. Felise ?
? I made not the dark and rain. Although
you say, some of you, that I make your light.
That lam sunshine,? she laughed. ? That I am
a star.?
She laughed again in a higher key. Several
other laughs went with hers.
Allars stood just within the doorway. His
face was so white that the other two men stared
at him and exclaimed in a rapid whisper to each
other. A little faded-looking woman, who was
pulling a fan to pieces, said cheerfully?
? To-night?s rain has washed you white. Come
and sit down. In half-an-hour or so we are going
to be festive. Oysters and champagne or?stout.?
But Allars did not even look at her.
?Come outside to me, Felise,? he said.
? Come inside to me, Kichard,? she mocked.
The two men and the one woman watched
interestedly. This pale young husband, with the
stern face and dark eyes, they had seen before
many times; they had called him a ? good fellow.?
But Felise was their darling.
?We differ so about suppers,? she said. ?He
has not an inclination for oysters, and he thinks
that champagne is bad for my feet. That it
makes me flighty.?


? Don?t I tell you I want you ? Damn
suppers! ?
?Now you are getting naughty; and it is such
a long time since we had a supper. If I come
outside shall you want me to go home ? ?
? Come.?
? But ?shall you ? ?
She stood up and looked at him with her head
on one side. Her wonderful and fresh young
beauty seemed to fill and purify the room and to
blot out all its ugliness and bareness. She was
pale, with the pallor of an Eastern houri, and
there was the grace of a wild sweet flower about
her. Her eyes were dusky, full of fire and sleep.
Among the brown of her hair were shadings of
o # o
gold and red, and her lips were tender and
self-willed.
She was dressed in soft white silk, gold-
braided and picturesque ?? in all her best array ?
as she had gone a lovely Juliet to her grave.
Not one of them all in the room but felt her
magical beauty. She had adorable attitudes and
gestures. AVith her head on one side and one
finger on her lip she looked at her husband from
between long curling lashes. Only this very
night that attitude had won her shouting, deafen-
ing applause.
? Come,? said Richard sternly.
? Fourquoi ?monster ! ? she demanded laugh-
ing. The little woman with the fan saw that he
clenched his white thin hands tightly.
? Do you intend to come 1 ? he said, his eyes
beginning to glower upon her.


She drew back theatrically.
? Look, you,? she said to them all, calling a
vibrating pathos into her voice, ? time was when
he would fly to me for the raising of this little,
little finger?time was when the twinkling of
O O
my eyelashes made breeze enough to waft him
to me?now ! ? she dropped her white powdered
hand with its little mocking finger and ran over
to his side ??now, see that matrimony has
made of me a slave! ?
His face, boyish and
touched his sleeve.
white, changed as she
He dropped his arm
and almost lifted her
boa-laden, around her,
into the dark of the
landing.
O
Then he held her.
? Stupid boy ! ? she said, looking up at him.
He held her closer.
? It is Nena,? he said.
? Well ? ?
? She is worse ; she is dying,? he whispered.
The beautiful face changed.
? Dying ?boy ? ? she whispered back.
? And she is calling for you. Y"ou, ceaselessly,
no one else. You must come.?
She shuddered, clinging to him in helpless
grief and terror.
?Nena! Dying! Mon Dien, boy?do you
know what it is you are saying??
He put his face down to hers suddenly, and
their cheeks lay together. Her arms were cling-
ing round his neck, and he held her pressed close
in his arms.


?My baby,? she whispered. ? God could
never be so cruel! He never could ! ?
? Come,?
She clung closer.
? I couldn?t watch her die ! ? she said. ?It is
not that I will not come ?but I could not watch
her die ! lam her mother, boy ! ?
? And she is crying for you,? he said.
" Who says she is dying ? ?
? Ellen.?
She drew her face away, covered it with her
hands, and burst into passionate tears. She ran
on wildly in French, interspersed with English,
about God?s goodness, her beautiful little child,
and its white young life.
? And it was not that I quite believed it
throughout,? she said, dropping her hands and
looking at him with a little triumphant smile.
? I knew that the dear God had a tender heart.
And the little one is so beautiful. Ellen ! ?
She drew away from her boy-husband and
laughed into his dark, miserable eyes.
?Go home,? she said, ? and laugh at her.
Snap your fingers at her ?so. Tel] her that
I, Felise, have only laughed at her.?
Allars stretched out his hands.
? For God?s sake, Felise 1 ? he said.
She stepped backwards slowly.
? Now, boy ! ? she said. ?Go ! Say to Ellen
that I laughed. Conceal it that I wept and
trembled. Have some wine and go home?
smiling.?
&?
? Felise, I swear to you that it is true.?


? (Jest vrai! And I believe ?oh, I believe ! ?
Her eyes flashed. ? Did I not believe before?
until three times ? And I wept ?for I saw my
little one in her coffin. Vraiment! Did I not
weep, boy % ?
? I tell you I have been with her, and-
She ran back.
?Go home and say all that to Ellen. Then
kiss my beloved and console her, and tell her
that in the morning she shall have flowers and
bon-bons.?
He followed, imploring, back into the presence
of the others.
?It is Ellen ! It is the saint ! ? laughed
Felise. ? The great high-priestess prophesying ! ?
They could see that she had been crying.
Even yet the mocking smile had hardly stilled
the quivering of her lips.
Allars turned away. Slowly he went along
the landing and down the stairs. His chin had
sunk to his breast once more.
Bright came to the doorway of his room again.
He laughed.
? Looks as if you?d a farmyard there,? he said,
pointing to the boa yet round Allars? wrist. ? I
expect,? said he, ? she refused to be carried
away home yet. But how is it you don?t stay ? ?
?Stand from the door,? said Allars shortly.
? Won?t you have a cigar ? ?
? I won?t ! Now, may I pass ? ?
Bright laughed.
? Ah well, she is a doocid fine little girl, and
you ?


But Allars? hand struck his shoulder.
? Another word,? he said, his eyes blazing,
? and I will stretch you on the ground. Fve
warned you before.?
The ex-Romeo laughed uneasily and struck a
match with his left hand.
?No harm, Allars,? he said. ? I?m always
afther forgetting she is another fellow?s wife.
You must blame the boards.?
Allars passed into the street. It was a back
street of not much importance. To-night it was
full of darkness and rain and wind. He had no
overcoat and only a small shabby umbrella. He
walked on rapidly with long even strides till he
came to a quiet one-lamped street. Here his
head fell forward hopelessly again, and he slack-
ened his pace as though he would drag out the
length of that street till the end of his life.
For he was afraid, with the great fear of death
shutting down close upon his heart.


CHAPTER 111
At last lie stopped before a narrow two-
storeyed house. It stood at the end of a long
white terrace. A little uneven path ran up
from the gate to the front door. Then came
two centre-worn steps and a stone verandah.
Allars took a latch-key from his pocket,
fingered it nervously, and leaned up against
the door.
He was listening at the door of his own home,
listening for a voice that made the music of his
O ? ? i
life?a tired child?s voice, full of impatience and
pain.
All was silent, silent as death.
He opened the door and went inside. The
hall was narrow, with rooms on one side of it
and a blank wall on the other. At the end of
it, and running up stiffly from its emptiness,
was a steep uncarpeted flight of stairs.
Allars stooped and took off his boots, and
crept down the hall with them in his hand. At
the stairway-foot he could see straight into the
second room.
It was a bedroom with a bare floor and very
few comforts. A bed with drawn mosquito


curtains fronted the door. He stood and
watched ; he could just see two pillowed childish
heads and the outlines of two short forms. He
sighed, and immediately, as if in answer to
his sigh, there came from the stairs above a
faint creaking and the soft rustling of a woman?s
O O
gown. Allars looked up ; there was a world of
suffering and anxiety on his face. The woman
coming downstairs saw it, and hastened a little
towards him.
? I put them to bed together,? she said,
nodding to the bed.
? Is she asleep ? ? he asked, staring into#her
face. The suppressed dread in his voice reached
her.
?Yes,? she said gently.
Gentleness seemed to belong to her, and the
soft ways of womanhood. The contour and
lines of her face were sweet; but one felt in
seeing her that she was trying to school tender-
ness and sensibility into sternness and even
callousness.
She was as tall almost as Allars himself; her
eyes were soft deep grey, and her hair was like
sunshine on ripe corn.
She passed downstairs, and went to the
bedroom door.
? Don?t you want to look at him ? ? she asked.
? Why is he not with his sister ? Why is he
here ? ? Allars asked suspiciously.
? He cried.?
? That is nothing. If she wants him, he
must stay.?


He went into the room and looked down at
the sleeping children. Two little curly heads ?
one golden, one dark ?lay close together. The
dark one belonged to Allars, the fair to Ellen.
? He must come back to his own bed,? said
Allars, half aloud. He looked up. ?You meant
it kindly, Ellen, I know ; but ?Eelise ?
She nodded.
I know,? she said. ? Where is she ? ?
He moved uneasily, and bent as though to
lift the sleeping child. Ellen put her hand
on his.
? She won?t mind,? she said sadly.
? She might,? said the young husband. ? And
she is right. He cares more for your child than
for his own sister. Eelise is right.?
He stooped again. His small son?s arm lay
round the neck of Ellen?s wee daughter.
? Little Nena ! ? said Ellen, as one speaking
a loving reflection aloud.
Allars looked at her.
? Did she cry for me ? ? he asked
? A little.?
? And for her mother ?
? A little?the last thing before ?she went to
sleep.?
He turned to her sharply.
?Look, you,? he said, ?they say sleep some-
times for?death.?
She put her hand on his arm,
? Dear Richard! ? she said softly, her eyes
full of tears.
But he pushed her away.


? I have felt it all the time,? he said. ? Let
me go, Ellen.?
He went past her quite calmly, as though he
were going for a walk.
She heard him go up the bare creaking stairs
and over the little landing. She heard the
handle of a door turn, and his steps above her
head.
Then all was still.
She knelt down by the sleeping children, and
buried her face in the end of their pillow. No
prayer crossed her lips, no tears ran down her
cheeks. Deep down at the bottom of her heart
was a feeling of gladness and relief for one taken
away from misery to come.
All her thoughts were in that little upstairs
bedroom, where the boyish father watched by
his best-beloved. She remembered nights and
days filled to her with the sound of his footsteps
pacing overhead.
She had gone to sleep, and had awakened to
the sound of them. Sometimes in the grey
dawn she had stolen up to the landing because
her heart ached for these two, and though she
mioht not enter, she liked to watch with them,
O 7
Often she saw without being seen. Up and
down he paced, up and down in his old bedroom
slippers. His lips knew crooning songs, and his
hands were tender as a mothers. He carried a
little child in his arms ?a little child dressed up
in scarlet and gold. On his shoulder a baby-
head with curls of gold and large pain-frightened
eyes found rest.


Then Ellen would steal away again, because
she always remembered Felise.
But sometimes in the early evening, when the
first gaslight shone and Felise was away at the
theatre, she would go again. Then there would
come floating out to her childish laughter at this
boy-father?s ways. He would be a wild beast or
a dog, groping along the floor on hands and
knees. Or he would be an old beggar-man,
shuffling about with a shawl over his shoulders
and a stick in one hand. Every evening for
weeks now he had been a minstrel-boy, singing
and whistling a motley collection of nursery
rhymes, English, Irish, Scotch.
He had carried his small son on one shoulder
and her laughing daughter on the other, and
been a giant, a bogey-man, spring-heeled Jack,
and old Father Christmas.
She almost cried to remember it all. She
said to herself over and over : ?He will never
love another child ; he will never play again;
his heart is broken.? But she did not cry;
she only sat quite still and thought of the little
dead child and the lonely-hearted father.
Presently she heard the turning of a key in
the front door, and another step in the hall.
She drew back quickly from the bed and the
children, and sat there coldly expectant, erect;
and with folded hands upon her knee.
A man stayed at the stair-foot where she and
Allars had stood. He, too, looked into her room,
and seemed to listen for a step from above. He,
too, was boyish-looking and white-faced.


This was her husband.
He was clean-shaven, and his hair was cut
close to his head. His forehead was projecting,
and gave to his eyes a wistful, piercing look.
For figure he was tall and rather broadly built;
but he looked far more like an overgrown school-
O
boy than a husband and a father.
?Hasn?t he come in'?? he asked, jerking his
thumb upwards.
She nodded. ? Half-an-hour ago,? she said.
He rubbed his head thoughtfully for a minute,
listened again, and then went towards her.
? How is the child ? ? he asked.
Her face was quite cold. ? Dead,? she said
indifferently.
He drew in a quick breath and looked at her.
Then he sat down at the bottom of the bed.
His face was greyish-white. ? Dead ! ? he
said in an awed, half-frightened tone.
She nodded carelessly. ? Richard went for
Felise,? she said. ?While he was away she died.
I have been upstairs and washed and dressed her,
for I knew Felise would not come.?
? And you touched her,? he said in a horrified
tone. ? Dead ?and you washed her. YWu
dressed her and she was dead ! ?
She laughed mirthlessly. ? Even to one?s grave
one goes washed and dressed,? she said. ?It was
not very dreadful. You carry your hatred of
death too far.?
? Y r ou are the most perfectly heartless woman
I have ever known. If your own child lay dying
I believe you would smile.?


She looked at the bed. ? Mary will not die/'
she said, ?so we will not discuss that. What
are you going to do ? Surely you have not come
home to stay ?so early.?
He stroked his chin without speaking.
? Even Felise is not home,? she continued.
? Not home ! ? he exclaimed. ? Then she
does not know.?
His wife smiled. ?In the morning,? she said,
? she will have hysterics before rehearsal.?
For five minutes they sat silent. Then his
glance wandered round the room. When it
reached a little bookshelf on a bare wall it grew
fixed. There were only six books there, but
their bindings were good. In that comfortless
O O
room they looked like pearls set shabbily.
? They would not possibly fetch four shillings
each,? said Ellen quietly.
He looked from her to the books and then
back again, but he did not speak.
She laughed. ?Itis a mistake if you think
they would bring more,? she said. ? I was
calculating to-day. That Keats was seventeen
and six, I remember ; but that was before I was
married?seven years ago.?
? I want the money very badly,? he said
slowly.
?You always do,? she answered.
? Even five shillings,? he added. ? Five shil-
lings would be a godsend. It is for a debt of
honour.?
? It always is,? she said.
The little golden-haired child stirred in her


sleep, and tightened her clasp round her bed-
fellow?s neck. Overhead there was a sound as
of some one moving.
? You ought to go up,? said Ellen.
Her husband stared. ?Up there !? he said.
? Yes. Of course, I know you wmn?t. But
Kichard is alone. I would go, only Felise would
resent it if she happened to return.?
?It is indelicate?horrible to intrude at such
a time,? said her husband. ? I myself would
resent it. Any man would.?
Ellen. ? I myself! Oh, listen to him, Mary,
my baby. If you were dead he would like to be
alone with you. Why, he would shudder at
your little cold hand ! ?
?It pleases you to be scornful,? said her
husband, ? God knows?perhaps I deserve it.?
There was sadness in his voice, dejection in
his face. Ellen looked at him sharply, then her
eyes flew back to her books.
He stood up and moved to the door.
? I am going to Richard,? he said in a hushed
voice.
He went upstairs slowly on tip-toe. His boots
were too worn and old to be noisy, but when by
chance the stairs creaked, which they did often,
he stood still and held his breath. Then he went
on again.
At last he reached the landing. Two rooms
opened from it?one dark, the other with a faint
light in it.
He peeped round the door. This room also
was a bedroom, and almost as bare as his own.


The bed stood in one corner, and at the first
sight of it his blood ran cold. It was so white,
so large, so empty. He went two steps forward
and stood again. There beside it, with his arms
folded across his chest, stood the friend of his
boyhood and youth and early manhood.
? Richard,? he said fearfully.
Allars half turned his head. ? Selwyn,? he
said.
There was nothing unusual in his tone. It
was just quiet.
? Won?t you come downstairs ? ? said Selwyn.
? No.?
They both stood silent. The man at the bed
folded his arms a little tighter; the man at the
door leaned heavily upon the door-frame.
And the night wore on. Felise did not come,
and Ellen wondered at the silence. It was
terrible.
At last Allars sighed heavily. The sound
stirred the deepest feelings of Selwyn?s heart.
He moved out of the darkness into the room.
? Richard,? he said huskily.
Allars looked round. ?Come and look at her,?
he said.
The calmness of his voice nerved the other
man. He went forward again, over the room to
the bed. There in the centre of it she lay quite
still. She was not more than three years old,
and very sweet and fair. Ellen had dressed her
tenderly. Her robe was white and daintily lace-
trimmed. Her hair fell in tiny golden curls
around her small white forehead, the little waxen


hands were crossed over her breast, and round
the soft baby chin was a cambric handkerchief.
Selwyn held his breath ; his eyes, were fascin-
ated.
? She looks as though she is asleep,? he said at
last in a whisper.
They watched intently. ? She looks as though
she had never lived,? he said, after another
pause.
Allars? mouth moved. ? She?the handker-
chief,? he said, with a rush of feeling. He
turned suddenly, as though he would dash from
the room.
Selwyn put his hand on his shoulder heavily.
? If I could help,? he mumbled.
The action held Allars. He breathed hard for
one full tense moment. Then he put up his arm
and rested it on his friend?s shoulder.
Like that they walked down the room and
back again. Neither spoke, neither looked to-
wards the bed. Only they tramped, backwards
and forwards, backwards and forwards, in that
soft baby presence, leaning upon each other.
Ellen down below heard them. Allars was
without boots, Selwyn with. She guessed how
they were walking. She thought of the dead
child, the sleeping children, herself, Felise.
? How they love ! ? she murmured. Then
lower, ? How he loves ! Dear God, it does not
seem possible. Only I could almost wish to die,
too, if he would walk so for me ! ?


CHAPTER IV
When the grey dawn came Ellen awoke. She
had slept heavily, and was but little refreshed.
She remembered how little Nena had died and
she had dressed her, she remembered AHars*
silent misery and her own husband?s efforts as
consoler.
She had gone to sleep to the sound of their
trampings, and listening for Felise?s latchkey.
And she had only just now wakened. She
went to the stair-foot and listened. All was
silent.
? I suppose Felise was too tired for hysterics,?
she murmured, as she proceeded with her toilet.
? Although with Richard and Selwyn there ?I
am surprised she considered that.?
She smiled bitterly. All her smiles were
bitter now.
Four years ago her philosophy had been that
in all there was good, and that the evil was
merely as crust to the bread loaf. She was a
clergyman?s daughter, and had be&i liberally
educated in all the rudiments of charity. At
eighteen she stumbled before love, young, fresh-
featured, electric. His first kiss revealed to her
33 c


how many mansions heaven might hold, and the
insignificance of earth?s highest mountain.
She felt as one who has been whispered of the
number of the stars, and has been shown the
finiteness of the infinite.
The moon and the stars, the heavens and the
earth, all these were ?Love. Love was to be life
to her for to-day and for ever.
One who thus weaves a love-band around for
ever, crowds Eternity into to-day.
But Eternity rebels.
? So far,? he says to the earthly love-weaver,
? for to-day. But all the to-morrows are mine.
For each one that you take I shall try you.
Before each one there are fresh burdens and new
thoughts. At the very end there may be a
crown. But you must not struggle for it. You
have only to weave?and be very patient.?
And so the weaver goes on. Only occasion-
ally does he remember Eternity.
Ellen had forgotten.
She remembered not the mansions of heaven
nor the heights of earth. She walked along the
plain of the world named Commonplace and
Ordinary.
She cooked dinners and dusted corners, and
calculated how many pennies she could save in
a shilling.
And she went back into the imperfect ways of
rigid charity.
Finding her earthly idol lacking in the ideal-
ities wherewith she had idealised him, she gave to
her God a worship of awe with a substratum of


resentment, and not even a streak of beautiful
living love.
This morning in the streaky dawn she read a
chapter in the Bible, and repeated her morning
prayers.
Then she went back to the stair-foot and
listened. All was very still yet.
She wondered how her husband had dared to
pass a night in a death-chamber. Then if he
had dared. The possibility that he had not
brought another thought to her.
She darted back into her bedroom to her book-
shelf. It was empty ! Her beloved books were
gone. For the first moment the desire to simply
cover up her face and cry was strong. The next,
she turned away, smiling bitterly.
? I must have the bump of acquisition abnor-
mally developed to care so much,? she muttered.
She went into the kitchen to light the fire.
Kneeling there, before the empty fireplace, in
the colourless dawn, she looked fully thirty-five.
She was just twenty-five. Her toilet was spruce
and particular as ever, but wakeful nights and
illness of mind and body have markings deeper
and rapider than time.
.Presently there came the patter of little feet
through the hall.
? Baby must go back to bed,? she said, with-
out looking round. She was stooping still before
the grate, and wafting a newspaper to and fro.
The footsteps paused in the doorway.
?Mary must run back to bed, and wait till
mother comes,? she continued. ?At once.?


The last two words were peremptory. There
was a short gleeful laugh behind her, and a little
white nightgown ed figure leapt forward and
sprang to her back. Two soft arms clasped her
neck, and a childish voice ordered?
? Gee-up, mumsie ! Gee-up ! ?
She threw one arm behind her, and swung the
child round into her embrace.
? You naughty boy,? she whispered. But she
put her face down and kissed the soft lips and
cheeks and hair.
This was Bichard?s child?and Felise?s. This
rogue with the great brown eyes sparkling and
dancing with mischief, this almost perfectly beau-
tiful mite with all manner of adorable ways and
sweet eye-glances.
She kissed him again and again, pretended to
toast his little pink feet before the leaping flames,
to put him under the tap, and out of the window.
And he kissed her back and hugged her, and
sprang in her arms and bubbled with wild
joyous laughter.
No one had such a laugh as this glad sweet
child.
Suddenly the door flew open, and Felise stood
before them. Felise in her stage dress still, with
large wild eyes, and face bloodless even to the
lips.
The boy, seeing his mother, scrambled out of
Ellen?s arms and ran to her. She put her hand
down on his curls and held him.
?You are worse than heartless,? she said, with
a sob in her throat.


? I am very sorry,? said Ellen entreatingly.
? I am very, very sorry, Felise.?
?You are glad.?
?I am sorrier than I can say. I can only tell
you I forgot for the moment.?
? You said she would die. I can never
forgive you for that.?
Ellen did not speak. She turned to the fire,
and began to blow it mechanically.
? I am going to give you a cup of coffee,? she
said gently. She heard the door shut behind
her.
? Must you go to rehearsal to-day ? ? she
asked. Again there was no reply. She looked
over her shoulder and saw the room was empty.
From the hall came a sound she knew well.
She sprang up and flung open the door.
Outside Felise was standing like a beautiful
fury. In one hand she grasped a strap, and was
in the act of bringing it down on the little white
nightgowned form.
Her face was almost livid.
? I will whip the devil out of him ! ? she cried.
But Ellen snatched him from her. He clung
to her, shuddering, with tears in the eyes that
had but just now been brimming with laughter.
? My darling ! my darling ! ? whispered Ellen.
? Give him to me,? ordered Felise. Her eyes
were glowering with an anger fast rising.
But Ellen showered kisses and caresses upon
him, and drew further away with him.
A tremble came into Felise?s voice. She
turned her face to the stairway and called?


? Richard ! ?
? Oh, Felise, don?t! Don?t, Felise ! ? cried
Ellen miserably.
? Richard ! ?
He came downstairs slowly. His face was
haggard and worn, his eyes heavy. He had
watched the night through.
?He has been making a shameful noise,?
panted Felise. ?He has been shrieking with
laughter, and Nena is dead. I demand that she
shall give him to me.
?It was my fault, he did not know,? said
Ellen.
?Is he our child, or is he hers, Richard, I
inquire ?
? What the devil do you want to do, women ? ?
?He laughed, and Nena is dead. I will half
kill him for it.?
? Give him to me, Ellen,? said Richard.
He lifted him into his arms and ran upstairs.
When he came down he was yet white, and
his eyes were wrathful for all their tiredness.
?Go back to your room,? he said to his
wife.
She began to cry. A stranger might have
said it was a boy?s and girl?s quarrel.
? Do you hear me 'I ? he said.
? Oh, I hear you and I see you,? she laughed.
? I hear you ! I hear you ! I hear you ! ? Her
laughs ran through the hall wildly. After the
silence they were terrible. Then she burst into
passionate tears, and then she laughed again.
?My God!? said Allars, gazing helplessly


about him. ?It is too much. It is too much.
What am I to do ? ?
Ellen came to his assistance.
?You will go and bring a jug of cold water
and half drown her,? she said.
Felise stopped in the midst of another wild
burst of weeping, and looked at them both.
?You think I am at your mercy,? she said, ? I,
a poor bereaved mother. It remains yet, that
we shall see. Stand aside ! ?
She moved upstairs with the air of a tragedy
queen.
And Richard seized a hat and "went out,
slamming the door behind him.


CHAPTER Y
For an hour Ellen strove with her longing to
find and comfort Richard?s boy, and a new wave
of hatred towards Felise rushed through her.
She had never loved her.
This morning, however, love for Richard?s boy
surmounted dislike for Richard?s wife.
She thought of him while bathing and dressing
her own little one, and she longed to perform the
same motherly offices for him, too.
She was even cold and short with small
golden - haired Mary, remembering his dark
beseeching eyes. And she missed him, his laugh
and his words, and his ways, as she always did,
on the days when Felise ?kept him at home.?
At last she put Mary down on the floor with
a strict injunction to ? be good,? and went softly
and slowly upstairs.
Richard was still out and Felise alone with her
two children ?one living and one dead.
Half-way upstairs Ellen stopped. She fancied
she heard a low whimpering cry dying away.
He had been alone then. Alone and miserable
for nearly two hours because he had laughed.
When she reached the first little landing, her
40


heart was hot within her. There was only one
door here, and it stood half open. It belonged
to a small attic room with a sloping roof
window.
Under the window was a narrow, untempting
bed. Ellen stepped to the door and looked in.
Felise was sitting on the floor with her back
resting on the bed. In spite of her sorrow, her
passion, and her sleepless night, her face was yet
lovely.
Her dress was dishevelled, her hail- rough, and
her face white. But her boy was in her arms,
and her attitude, her motherliness, and her
beautiful features were perfect.
The tears were yet heavy in her eyes.
?Mamma?s darling,? she was saying. ?Boy
shall have a big stick and beat mamma.?
He laughed. ? A stwap,? he said. ? A gwater
big stwap with a knot to it.?
? And would you beat me, boy ? ?
He looked roguish. ? I would ask farver to,?
he said.
She kissed him again and again.
?Oh, boy, boy, mamma is so naughty.
Mamma wants beating and burning and killing,
and she wants farver to do it. O, mon Dieu,
to be lying still and pure as Nena ?to be quiet
and cold and dead I 0, mon Dieu! mon Dieu! ?
Ellen moved softly away. She was used to
Felise?s tears and hysterics and tempers. But
never before had she heard her long for death.
It seemed too incongruous. Beautiful tanta-
lising Felise, still and cold.
O 7


? What is it that I am, boy ? Une miserable f
Some day, some day, you will awake and mamma
will not be. She will have gone, boy, and you
will be as they call motherless. 0, mon Dieu !
mon Dieu! ?
Ellen hurried back to the kitchen. Then an
exclamation of anger broke from her. In the
middle of the floor sat the freshly-washed and
white-gowned little Mary. She was hugging
an empty black kettle and trying to drag off
the lid.
? Put down the kettle ! ? said Ellen sharply.
But the child did not heed her. Her small,
fair face w T as alight with eagerness; her strug-
gling fingers begrimed and busy.
? Put it down,? commanded the mother.
? Twon?t tome off,? said the child, redoubling
her efforts; ?stoopid ole fing. ?Twon?t tome
off.?
Ellen set her mouth.
? I will have you obey even a look,? she said.
Then she knelt down, put away the kettle, and
hit the grimy little hands severely.
Mary immediately began to cry.
?When mother says put it dowm, you put it
down? said Ellen. Then she hit again.
This child gave her pleasurable feelings of
power as of love and pride. She had one life to
make go in the right way.
?There,? she said. ?Mary naughty girl.?
An exclamation came from the doorway?
?Oh, you heartless and cruel! Oh, you un-
natural and cold ! ?


Felise stood there, her small son?s hand grasped
in hers, her beautiful eyes aflame. She darted
over to the weeping child. M
?How could you? Oh, how could you, Ellen??
She sank down on the floor and gathered the
baby into her arms, lavishing caresses upon her.
Ellen did not speak. She smiled instead.
Felise looked up with lovely soft eyes.
? I came to you to tell you how I am full of
mistakes,? she said, ? and how that I wonder
you can endure to live with me.
? You have wondered that before,? said Ellen
coldly.
? I know. And it is that which convinces me
lam quite unstable. It makes me weep some-
times to think that one hour I do not know what
I shall do the next.?
? You can force yourself to do what is right.?
? No; you can. But I have not the desire for
the two hours together.?
?It is the way you were brought up, I sup-
pose,? said Ellen.
? Oh, Ido not blame that. It was my father
who brought me up, you see. He was as I am.
?You will be to blame everlastingly for
Philip,? said Ellen, pointing to the small, lovely
child.
Felise smiled. ?You call him Philip,? she
said, ?in your cold, not loving way. I call him
boy, my beautiful, sweet, small, precious son.
And who shall blame me ? Who shall say it is
my fault if he grows up as I am ? ?
?God,? said Ellen solemnly.


The children on the floor were discussing the
points in their late whipping.
?All over my back,? said Philip, ?and my
legs.?
? And me, too,? said Mary sorrowfully.
? And my side and my arms and my toes,?
continued the boy ; ? and I was Weedin' and
Weedin' everywhere.?
? Oo?ugh ! ? said the little girl.
? And the blood?s all wolling downstairs.?
? Ou? ou ? les look ! ?
? You ought to whip him for that? said Ellen.
But Felise laughed.
Whip him ! she said. ? I will never whip
him any more. He is all I have. All I have.?
The tears rushed to her eyes. That was
always the way, laughing and crying in the
same moment.
Nena has gone,? she said. ? She is dead.
My beautiful baby. If boy grows up bad and
God points a finger at me?when He remembers
Nena He will forgive. She is one of His lovely
and pure angels, and I have given her to Him.
If I am bad He will remember I had a good
? Can?t you be good for her sake, Felise ??
? Alas ! I would have tried, only that now I
am not able.? She crossed over to Ellen. ? I
am truly miserable, she sobbed, ? and I am truly
bad. Sometimes it is as though lam on fire and
I cannot think or know. But now I cannot try.?
She sobbed bitterly and caught Ellen?s hand.
? I have done something,? she whispered, ? worse


than anything I have ever done before. I wish
I had died, or not been born. If lam not found
out, I will try then. Oh, yes, I will try then.
0, mon Dieu / ?
?If you are not found out !? exclaimed
Ellen.
? Ah, yes; but I shall be ! I feel it coming at
nights ; I feel it coming when I am lonely, when
I am laughing, when I am singing. 0, mon
Dieu ! and I could be good! It then would be
that boy should have a mother, and Richard a
wife ! Ah, I am truly a miserable ! ?
The front door opened, and the two husbands
came in together. Allars was slightly in
front.
? You can stay on in the house,? he said ;
? but keep out of my way.?
? Thank you,? said Selwyn. ? Your permission
reminds me I am your debtor for a few weeks
rent.?
Felise stopped weeping, and clutched Ellen?s
arm. Her face went whiter than before. Then
she ran into the hall, and looked at her husband.
? What have you been doing ?? he asked. He
saw her white tear-stained face.
? Come upstairs, dear,? he said gently. ? Come
and lie down; you will be ill.? He put his arm
round her waist in a boyish, helpful way. ? Lean
on me,? he said.
? Oh, boy,? she whispered, weeping, ? you are
good ! Oh, boy, keep me with you, and do not
go from me to-day.?
They went upstairs together.


? What is the matter ? ? asked Ellen of her
husband. ?You have quarrelled!?
?He has,? said Selwyn. ? I was giving him
advice about Felise, and he blasphemed me.
That is all.?


CHAPTER VI
The little child Nena had been in her green
churchyard-home for four days. The small city
home that she had left seemed almost as it had
been before she had come into it.
There were no longer wild games of romps in
the bedroom ; the little scarlet and gold dress-
ing-gown was laid away ; the small brother had
one playmate less. And Felise had a new black
dress with trimmings all of mournful crepe. It
had only just come home, and she had slipped it
on to ? see if it was all right.?
In one corner of the bedroom was a curtain
wardrobe. She had a wonderful array of shabby
finery in it, but never a black gown at all.
She fitted this one on eagerly, and trailed to
and fro across the room in it. It set off her
chiselled loveliness to perfection, and the curves
of her beautiful figure.
She had found, too, a new and ravishing way
of dressing her hair, and was full of delight that
her efforts were so well rewarded.
To-day, there being no rehearsal, she had
devoted a long half-morning to the entrancing
task of trying to increase her personal attractions.
47


She felt amply repaid every time she reached
the end of the room where the round mirror
hung. Her wonderful beauty and witchery were
gifts for which she was heartily thankful. Never
did she seek to underrate their value, nor to
boast vainly of them. To her they were talents,
to be treated reverently, and to be increased. To
be beautiful, and to win love, were her aims in
life, and no detail that could further those aims
was slighted by her.
She rejoiced to-day in the perfection of her
coiffure and the fit of her gown ; and she longed
for another woman to endorse her criticism of
herself, to sympathise or to advise.
Richard was away upon that daily task of his
?seeking for work ; but even had he not been,
it was not Richard she wanted. ? She desired
criticism,? she told herself, ?not admiration.?
At last she went downstairs slowly, her dress
making a delightful frou-frou of newness, the
pose of her head half proud, half sad. She
tapped at Ellen?s door.
? Is boy here ? ? she asked, peeping in.
Seeing her, Ellen startled visibly. She did
not notice the pallor in the beautiful face, nor its
sadness, nor the petitioning of the eyes for
woman?s sympathy. She simply saw an elegant
new black dress and an elaborate coiffure.
? Philip is here,? she said coldly.
She was cleaning saucepans, and at once felt
plain and dirty. Her hair was done in a neat
knob close to her head, and a large check apron
covered her shabby dress.


? Go to your mother, Philip,? she said shortly.
Then she turned away, and made a rattling noise
with the saucepan and the wire cleaner.
? Are you very busy ? ? asked Felise hesi-
tatingly.
? Oh, no,? said Ellen. ?Not more than usual.
I?m expecting to have half done by bedtime.
?Leave the work,? urged Felise, ?and come
upstairs and let us talk. Then afterwards we
will apply ourselves until there is no longer any-
thing to do for a week.?
But Ellen crashed about and took no notice.
There was one point that she never considered*
and that was that Felise was the only bread-
winner amongst them all.
Felise lingered.
?You have not told me yet if you admire my
costume,? she said.
? Admire it ! ? exclaimed Ellen. ? Oh, Felise,
you are the most thorough doll I ever knew.?
? Doll! Doll! ? said Felise excitedly. ? Doll
do you call that lam % Then I say to you that
you are a graven image ! You have not so much
as put on a black ribbon for my darling. You
thought I did not notice ! But she was nothing
to you ! Oh, no; I believe if Selwyn died you
would not wear a yard of crepe. In this skirt
settlement I have five yards.?
Ellen burst into a harsh laugh.
?If Selwyn died,? she said, ? I would not
have even a black border to my handkerchief.?
She went through the back door into the yard,
bustling, busy, anxious over many things.


Felise turned away, a spot of angry colour in
her cheeks.
On the top step sat Philip. He was watching
her with grave, considering eyes. She made a
little rush up to him, and snatched him into her
arms.
? Mamma has bought boy a beautiful black
outfit also,? she whispered. ? A suit all black.?
? Wiv a whistle to it ?? he asked.
She shook her head, and drew him into the
bedroom tenderly. From the bed she took up
his sombre garments.
?No whistle,? she said with sweet gravity.
? This suit is for wee Nena, boy; to show how
you loved her, and how you grieve that she will
come back no more.?
She dressed him lovingly, dropping frequent
tears. Every touch from her fingers showed
love, pride, motherhood.
? To-morrow,? she said, ? to-morrow we will go
to her grave ; her lonely little brother and her
broken-hearted mother. Ah ! ravisseinent! It
suits thee like a king.?
She walked round him delightedly.
? Thou hast the proud mien, my boy baby,?
she said, ? and the deep beautiful eyes.?
She kissed him rapturously.
Then she looked up, startled to see her
husband beside her.
He stared at the sombre-clothed little lad, at
his black-gowned lovely wife.
? What does this mean ? ? he asked.
She stroked her gown.


? It is for Nona,? she said in a hushed whisper.
He did not speak. The blackness stifled him
almost. He pressed his hands over his eyes for
a second.
When he took them down he saw her fumbling
amongst his clothes, which were under the
curtain also.
She came back to him with his blue serge coat
in one hand, his sailor hat in the other.
? See,? she said tenderly. ? See, beloved ! I
remembered how that it would hurt you to dis-
cover you had been forgotten. When you were in
such misery last night it came over me what I
might do for you also. ?What!? I exclaimed, ?shall
it be that I and this child-angel shall monopolise
all the crepe/? Was she not also yours? Did
she not worship the tread of your feet upon the
staircase ? Oui, vraiment! ?
Allars groaned and stretched out his arms.
They were always empty now. His shoulders
never ached under a beloved burden. His knees
were never sore with creeping over bare boards.
He stretched out his arms, and she crept into
them and folded hers round his neck.
?It will be that our hearts will ache for
always,? she whispered.
He pressed his lips to her soft white throat.
? And it is that we wonder why God gave her
to us?to despoil us so soon,? she went on.
She was crying softly, and his tears fell on her
newly-dressed hair.
Philip had scampered away unmissed to show
his playfellows the beauty of his suit.


?Beloved!? whispered Felise. ?Dearest!
Thou wilt be full of loneliness now for many
days ! It must be. But it shall not be that
thou shalt go with the bent head and the
shoulders that droop. Beloved ! ?
She drew back her head and looked mto Jj ls
face with a smile all of love and tenderness. She
lifted one of his hands to her lips and kissed it
passionately. Then her mouth quivered.
? Thou art all the world to me. Thou?thou
dearest and beloved. Vraiment? when I see
thee in a crowd and thy head high above all
others ?and thy eyes ? vraiment , I whisper, He
is a king, and he is mine !? Mine! Not for one
of those other women hast thou a glance. Not
one of them through all the years that run into
eternity shall know how good it is to feel thy
embrace and have thy kiss. _
He kissed her again and again. Her lair
ways and soft words sweetened the bitterness ot
The tears left his eyes and he smiled at her.
And that smile was as a laurel crown to her for
her skilfulness in using the gifts that God hac
given her. , T
? You one sweet woman,? he whispered, i
10 He said it as tenderly as he had said it almost
seven years ago when he, an ardent youth o
nearly nineteen, had wooed her.
? Truly boy % Thou dost not feel that
now thou? hast found I am full of erring and
naughtiness, it would have been better hadst
o *


Thou never seen my face ? Thou dost not feel
that ? ?
He kissed her again and again.
? Never !? he said hotly. ?Though all the
future is full of evil, I could never wish
one day that I have spent with you had not
been.?
? If thou earnest to me and showed me how
that thou wert God?s worse man, I should still
love thee. If thou wert in grief and shame, I
should love thee more ! ? She looked up again.
?Now you say.?
There was a certain feverishness about her, and
it brought a remembrance to him.
? One may love through all but shame,? he
said. ? Never take hands with shame, Felise.
It eats into a man?s heart and makes life a
burden to him, so that at last he will be glad to
creep into a corner and die like a dog. Never
talk of shame, beloved.?
She gave a wild, strangled sob and sprang
from his arms.
? Surely thou art an inquisition and a funeral
service,? she exclaimed. ? Truly thou hast the
tongue of a preacher and the eyes of a denounc-
ing angel. lam fatigued. I have ennui. Too
much love is a weariness, I must go out.?
? I came to fetch you,? said Allars. ? You
have no rehearsal ? ?
? No ?for which I have regret. I would like
to dance or sing. Boy, what is it that your eyes
are saying ? ?
She looked at him with parted lips.


? I have the boat just down in the bay. I
came for you and the child.?
She clapped her hands. A soft red flush ran
into her cheeks, and her eyes sparkled.
Such a picture of gladness for a man who had
prepared a surprise. Allars reaped a threefold
reward for his thought from her face.
? Thou hast a thoughtful mind,? she said,
? See, I am ready; and boy, he is ready, too ?
he has but gone down to Ellen. And thou shalt
put on the coat with the death token upon the
sleeve. It will be then that we are remembering
our beloved throughout the day.?
She snatched up the coat and held it ready.
He hesitated, then saw the solemn earnestness of
her face. He drew off his grey one slowly and
put on the one she was holding. Its crepe band
was very broad.
She handed him his sailor hat, black-banded
also. Then she sighed contentedly.
? We can now feel happier,? she said ; ? but it
would have pierced my heart to have been on
the blue sea that laughs, and under her beautiful
heavens, and no mark at all to show that we are
bereaved.?
They went down to the boat, a mournful-look-
ing trio, husband and wife and child.
It was a long walk and the day was hot, but
Felise chattered so merrily and tenderly that
Allars was surprised out of his gloom and joined
in her laughter.
The boat, a little blue-and-white skiff, with a
fantastic ?Naiad? upon her bow, lay down in


the bay. They went gaily down the long white
road, and at every step the glorious sea-air,
smiting them, freshened their spirits until they
felt young and free and gladsome as they had
not done for months.
It was the last of their glad days together, the
last time their laughter would float out so joy-
ously above the blue-green waves. But there
was no fairy elf, nor water-nymph, nor sky-sprite
to whisper to them the word that would have
blasted the goldenness out of their faces and left
them grey.
So in their unwittingness they made plans,
beautiful plans for all their rest-days and hob-
days. They were very poor, very lonely, and less
than a week ago the dread Reaper had culled the
fairest flower out of their hearts? garden. But
to-day the world of earth and sea and sky was
brimming with such intoxicating life that they
drank it in as veritable earth-children, and were
glad because the world was beautiful and it was
play-day with them together.
They left the little blue bay very lazily and
went out into the wider waters, where blue bays
gleamed everywhere. All around them was
the grave young bushland?many, many years
younger than it is to-day. It ran right down in
some places to the water as though it loved it
and wanted to lie close to it. Here and there it
stood, sternly cresting grey boulders, and then
again it gave way to gleaming, golden sands.
Round the ? Naiad ? the waters laughed ; they
seemed so glad to have this merry little craft


with them. And they played with her and sang
to her songs of the glory of sunshine and sea
and sweet fresh air, and all with a soft plash,
plash, and lush, lush, for the beginning and end
of every song.
Into the young husband?s cheeks the red of
pleasure came with the red of sunburn, and made
him comely, and Felise laughed for pure gladness.
? Thou lookest as thou didst on the morning
when I first met thee,? she said gleefully. ? I
loved thee first that thou couldst laugh. Truly,
a laughing man is a gift from God. Many men
can cackle, and some can laugh?under their
skins. But thy laugh ! It sent the blood into
my heart and made me feel as after wine.?
? Poor little Felise ! I laugh but seldom now.?
? No; that I know. Thou lookest like a
beardless Apostle. Thy mouth-corners are drop-
ping, and two lines are coming between thine
eyes. We have not so long for laughing, boy,
that we can grow proud of it. Ellen is keeping
all her smiles for heaven; she thinks there are
none up there.?
Allars dipped his oars into the water without
speaking. Then he looked up gravely.
? Ellen is a good woman, Felise,? he said.
? Truly, in her bones.?
? I wanted you all by yourself to-day, or I
should have asked her and Mary to come. Steer
more to your right, little woman.?
Her eyes smiled, as they always did at a word
of endearment from him.
?After this week,? she said, ?there will be


but few holidays for me. And next month we
go to Melbourne. Then it will be that we shall
begin to know if I am going to be a great
actress.?
? I wish to heavens I could shut you up in a
honey-suckled cottage ?you and Phil.?
? I should be happy so ?for a month. Nay,
I should be happy for ever, with thee and him.
But I am going to be a great actress, boy. After
Melbourne they will take me to London, and then
?then King Irving will come, and will implore
of me to play Cleopatra and Juliet and Desde-
mona at seventy pounds a night, instead of two
pounds a week. 0, ma foi! In those days
Philip, my son, thou shalt live like a king.?
She rested her chin on her hand and stared
dreamily over the harbour waters behind them.
? And we will make Ellen happy. And Mary
and Selwyn. She shall not know T what it is to
labour hard any more. And thy father, Richard;
he shall come to thee and say that thou hast not
done so ill.? Her eyes softened and glistened as
though tears were near. ? And he shall forgive
thee and take thee back again to be his son.?
Richard?s eyes sought hers with their old
adoring look; he dipped his oars in and out, and
watched her and his boy instead of the sea and
sky.
? Philip, peel mamma an orange,? he said at
last. ? You can make a fishing-line of the skin
if you have the skill to peel it thinly.?
But Felise caught the fruit-knife he threw, and
held out her hand for the orange.


? Pass it to me, sweet son,? he said. ?My
fingers are nimbler than thine. Thou hast never
played with thy father?s hair for hours and hours,
as I have done.?
She made him a thin winding line, and fast-
ened a piece of orange on with a hair-pin for a
hook.
? Voila! Sit close to mamma and be Peter/
? Peter Wedmond, mamma ? ?
? No, cherub. Peter in the Bible.?
?I would sooner be Peter Wedmond ; he has
a most stw T emendous snake in a bottle full of
water.?
? Then thou shalt be Peter Redmond. And
thou shalt have a snake in a bottle full of
water.?
The boy moved closer ; he adored his mother.
His eyes flashed up to hers.
?He killed it himself,? he said. ?He chased
it home. And it bit him, and he hit it. And he
looked over his shoulder and saw a wild bear
coming. So he hit it again, and carried it home
o O ?
over his shoulder.?
Felise laughed. ? But the bear ? ? she asked.
? Oh, it came at him pelting. It was a vewy
stwemendous bear. It had been killing dogs
and boys all day. And Peter, he just picked
up a stone and stared. And the bear came on.
And Peter stood still. And there were no other
stones and no sticks. And there were no twees
to get up and no fences to get under, and no
men to get behind. And Peter stood still and
just stared. Then he just shot the stone, and it


went wight down the bear?s froat and killed him
dead! ?
The boy?s eyes shone with his earnestness.
Felise laughed, overjoyed ; but Richard looked
grim.
? Who told you that, laddie ? ? he asked.
? Oh,? said Philip, with a shoulder shrug imi-
tative of Felise, ? I saw it. I was there some-
where ?bout. The same fings happened to me.?
Felise clapped her hands.
?Oh ! ? she said, ? he is a most wonderful
boy; he is a genius ; he will be a great novelist
or a hunter or a red-coated soldier ! ?
But Richard frowned.
?He will be a liar,? he said. ? Philip ! ?
? What a frightful voice,? said Felise.
?Yes, farver.?
?If ever you tell me another lie I will thrash
you.
? Yes, farver. Can I tell ?em to mamma,
though ? ?
Felise kissed him rapturously.
? That canst,? she said. ?It shall not be that
I will choke thy imagination. Be quiet, boy,
thou shalt not threaten and frown.?
At last the long, sweet day ended, and they
pulled into the little bay where the ? Naiad ? was
moored.
Lovely evening shadows crept over land and
sea. Blue-grey shadows deepening into steel-
grey, with pink cloudlets and blue cloudlets, gold
fringed, floating about where the Sun had left his
evening?s kiss. One or two pale young stars


stole out, and the moon hung a silver bow where
the blue-grey of the sky was tenderest.
Richard and Felise sauntered arm in arm up
the white dusty road, and Philip ran on in
front.
In half -an - hour they were back among
terrace houses and chimneys. City pavements
were beneath their feet, city sounds smote their
ears.
They reached their own street. Away, in
front of them, was Philip hurrying on without a
look to left or right.
A tall, broad-shouldered man, dressed in dark
grey, and wearing a soft felt hat, stumbled
against him.
Philip uncovered his dark curly head, as Felise
had trained him to do, and smiled engagingly.
?You didn?t see me, I fink ? ? he said.
The man prepared to pass him.
? I advise you to be quick out of this street,?
said Philip,
? Why ? ? asked the man, surprised.
? I?m just hurrying home to let out our dog.
He?s mad. If he saw you, he would tear you
into smitherweens.?
?Ah ! ? said the man. He stopped and stared
down from his great height into the small sun-
burnt face. He smiled a little.
Philip covered his head again and scampered
on.
Richard pressed Pease?s arm.
? Walk on,? he said, ? and hold up your head.
It?s my father. Just walk like this?straight on.?


But her face whitened, and she drew close to
the wall. . . T .t .
?0, del! 0, mon Dieu! 0 that i might
? For Heaven?s sake, Felise, don t be so foolish !
Hold up your head ! ? said Richard sharply.
But she dropped it, and pressed close to the
wall. _ , . ?
? Speak not to him, Richard, I implore ! ? she
begged. ?Venture not to look. 0, ciel! Oh,
Richard! 0, del!?
Richard?s face blazed as he dragged her forward.
But the man crossed the road and disappeared
from the street.
Philip ran up the little path and over the
verandah.
At the foot of the staircase Mary was playing
listlessly in loneliness.
Philip held up his head and walked in, taking
off his hat, and sighing as one tired.
? The boat capsized,? he said, ? and farver had
to save mamma. I saved myself. And all the
way as I was fwimming a most stwemendous
whale kept chasing me. But I got in first.


CHAPTER VII
At half-past ten that night Ellen reached down
her Bible to read her nightly chapter. She and
Mary were alone downstairs, Richard and Philip
above.
At a quarter to eleven she knew Richard would
come running down like a ? school-boy from his
school,? and would open the front door to go to
bring home his Felise.
At half-past eleven or twelve, or half-past
twelve, they would come in together, and Richard
would be silent, and Felise wild and hilarious, or
tired and impatient.
And then there would be silence ?sleep-time
silence ?and Ellen would doze and weep, or doze
and not weep, and some time between the night
and morning Selwyn would come home.
But it was only half-past ten yet. Ellen sat
down under the gas-light and opened her Book.
A sudden thought of Felise came to her. She
leaned her head on her hands and sat thinking,
thinking. She had never been inside a theatre
in her life, but her imagination conjured up a
vivid scene.
She saw Felise blushless and brazen, romnino"
62 �


skipping, coquetting before hundreds of eyes; a
simpering Juliet sentimentalising for public
favour, a hysterical Juliet dying to public
plaudits.
She could not conceive of a Felise the same
abroad as at home.
Then she regarded herself, sad, toil-worn, lonely.
She remembered her little-cared-for child, Felise?s
neglected one ?her spotless, tidy room, Felise?s
undusted and clothes-strewn one.
She opened her Book, a little sad smile upon
her lips. The book-mark lay in Isaiah, a pencil
mark before chapter xv.
?Only nine verses to-night,? she exclaimed
with a little relief in her voice.
Then she began to read.
?The burden of Moab. Because in the night
Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;
because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste,
and brought to silence.?
The silence of the house seemed to deepen.
It was not the silence of no presences, but rather
of a hundred ones with bated breaths.
Her lips moved slowly, meekly. The pallor of
her face and her look of tiredness and patience
had something of the pathetic about them. She
came to the fifth verse.
? My heart shall cry out for Moab ; his fugitives
shall flee unto Zoar.?
The silence was broken. She started to her
feet. That rap upon the door was loud enough
to wake an army of sleepers.
She went into the hall, trembling a little.


Then she stood still to reason with herself, and
assure herself that it could not be Felise, because
she had a latch-key, and it could not be Selwyn,
because he also had one. Who could it be at
this hour of the night?
?Don?t you go, Ellen,? said Richard from
above, ?I am coming.?
He ran downstairs. His hair was rough,
and his eyes looked as though he had been
sleeping.
? I just laid down with Pip, and must have
dropped asleep,? he said, as he passed her.
He opened the door, and came back im-
mediately with an envelope in one hand.
? May I come to your door to read ? ? he said
to her.
He had left the hall-door open, and the wind
came rushing into the hall.
Ellen stood aside and waited. She waited for
what seemed to her a whole night through, stand-
ing there at the stair-foot and gazing through the
open door into the street.
At last she turned to Richard. His face was
greyish-white, with all its boyishness gone. His
eyes were staring miserably at the wall beyond
her.
? What is it ? Oh, what is it?Selwyn ? ? she
broke out fearfully.
He did not answer. She rushed across to his
side.
c� Do you hear me ! ? she exclaimed. ? Speak
at once. He is dead! He has killed himself ?
he has.?


Richard looked at her.
?It is not about Selwyn at all,? he said. ?It
is nothing?for you.?
Suddenly a sob rose in his throat, and his eyes
grew wild. He put out his hands and seized
both hers and pressed them till she could have
cried at the pain. Then he dropped them and
brushed past her into the hall.
She caught a muttered word like ? God.?
? Where did the boy go to V? he demanded.
He rushed to the door and looked up and down
the street. Then he came back and picked up
one of Selwyn?s hats.
? Where are you going ? she asked. She ran
to the verandah, following him.
?To bring Felise home,? he said. ?Go in and
shut the door.?
She went in and shut it. For two hours she
paced up and down the hall and through the
lower rooms. Midnight came and went. She
was very lonely, very miserable, and her anxiety
seemed to be eating her heart away. She sat
down at last on the stairs and cried in a tired
resentful way.
? Men are so cruel,? she said. ? I wonder he
did not tell me to go to sleep.?
She went back to her bedroom and stood
staring down at her child?s happy careless face.
Then she turned to her Bible.
? I will read my chapter for the morning,? she
said, speaking half aloud, ? while I have the
Book out.? So she opened at the New Testament.
In her religion she was methodical ?she took the
O


Old Testament for night reading, and the New
for morning.
This time, however, before she could commence
there was the sound of a step over the verandah,
and of a latch-key being fitted into the keyhole.
She sat perfectly still, her feeling of resent-
ment deepening because of her loneliness and
anxiety.
It was Selwyn. He came into the room
heavily, and sat down somewhere near the door.
She went on reading as though he were not
there.
Five minutes dropped away for ever.
? Richard and Felise are not home yet,? she
said at last, in the tone of one deeply absorbed.
She was reading Christ?s sermon upon the
mount without heeding a word of it.
? Ellen ! ? Selwyn said in a half whisper.
She ran her finger along the line and went on
reading.
? Ellen ! ? he said again.
This time she said ?Well?? coldly and with-
out interest.
He rose slowly and crossed over to her.
? Nell! ? he whispered in the tone of seven
years ago.
? Well ? ? she said again. ?Be quick ! ?
For answer he knelt down suddenly beside her
chair, put his arms round her waist and his head
upon her breast. She could feel him shuddering.
She sat perfectly still, her heart leaping
wildly.
This dark bowed head was dearer than life


to her. That it lay thus, voluntarily, made life
seem beautiful and even death tolerable.
She bit her lips and drove her nails into her
hands. He shivered again. Then she forgot
everything upon earth but just this miserable
boy-man.
She folded her arms round him and drew him
higher and held him closer. She put her lips
upon his hair and kissed him again and again and
again. She whispered the sweet words of her
wooing time in the voice of her womanhood.
They came strangely and tenderly to her lips.
For five minutes she was his lover again.
He burst into tears. Such tears! Great hard
sobs that shook him from head to foot. She was
terrified.
? Can?t you tell me, Wyn ? Can?t you tell me,
dear ? ? she begged in a loving patient voice.
He pressed closer to her, only sobbing.
? I can?t think of a calamity so bad that we
cannot face it, Wyn,? she said.' ? You are here ?
?kissing his hair?? and Mary is there.? Then
she hastened to add, ? And Richard and Felise
are alive.?
? I wish to God you had never seen my face ! ?
? I wish you had never seen me, Nell.?
(( d�nt.? She looked round the room.
? There is not much else to lose,? she added.
All is lost, he said wildly. ?I am ruined?
disgraced?you and Mary?my God?a felon?l
am ruined.?
She pushed his head back.
? Speak quite clearly,? she said. ? Think what


you are saying. Are you sure you are not
intoxicated ? ?
? I am quite sober. I am quite sane. Al-
though you might wonder at it, if you knew
the mill of torture I have been through. Nell?
he pressed towards her again and whispered
it ?Nell, lam a forger ?I am a forger, Nell ?
and I wish to God I were dead.?
She sprang up sharply, flinging him from her.
She tore her collar open and gasped. But she
did not speak.
He stood up and tried to encircle her with
his arms.
? For God?s sake, Nellie, don?t look at me
so !? he said wildly. ? Don?t! Don?t! Don?t! ?
But she drew slowly away from him, stepping
backwards, her eyes fixed on his face with an
expression he had seen in no eyes before, and
which cowed him more than a torrent of words
could have done.
He sank down into the chair she had left.
The bitterest of his remorse passed from his
face, leaving it sullen and frightened-looking.
? Are you going to tell of me ? ? he said.
?Are you going to give me up 1 ?
But she did not speak.
? X did it for your sake ?and the child?s,? he
said ; ? and I only took my own.
? Your own ? ??she started. ? Your own ? ?
? Yes, wasn?t it my own ? Didn?t old Allars
bring us up to expect it?Richard and me?
didnT he promise it, fifteen thousand to Richard
and five to me ? Didn?t he ?


? Yes, but ?
?And just because we married didn?t he cast
us off?he and my father?didn?t he ? ?
? So ? began Ellen again.
o o
? And so I took some. It was mine?and I
took it. A thousand pounds. I had to have
it by yesterday. It was a debt of honour.?
Then he went towards her and whispered.
She started back.
? Felise ! ? she said.
His face was full of truth.
?It was when Nena was ill,? he went on, in
the same hushed tone. ? I had taken some
grapes up to her. Felise was kneeling at a
little table writing on a cheque. You know
how clever she is at handwriting. She had done
it for a paltry ten pounds! I snatched it from
her and charged her with it, and she began to
cry. I took it away with me, and multiplied it
by a hundred. But I swear before Heaven until
I saw her doing it I had never a thought of it.?
? Well, she didn?t do it, then,? said Ellen.
? Yes, she did. The next day.?
Ellen sat down and dropped her face down
to the Book. Her tears fell in a storm and
blistered the page on which the holy sermon
was written.
Selwyn felt a little relieved at her tears.
Anything was better than the stony horror of
her face. And this at least was womanly.
?She has run away,? he continued. ?She
was not at the theatre to-night. She sent a
wild sort of letter refusing to act any longer.?


Ellen went on crying, every sob growing
quieter.
? Bright is like one demented,? said her
husband. He drew a little nearer.
?Do not touch me!? she exclaimed. ?For
the love of God give me a little time to get over
the ?horror of you.?
He stood patiently reared up against the wall,
and watched her.
? I would give ten years of my life to live
the past two days again,? he said at last in a
low trembling voice.
? Oh, that is so easy to say ! ? she exclaimed.
? I have spoilt your life ! Your beautiful life
that I was going to make ! ?
? And our child?s?and your own,? she said.
He strode down the room.
? I am such an unholy, dishonoured wretch
that I wish I could die,? he said.
She took out her handkerchief and dried her
eyes.
?You are not fit,? she said. ?Do you ever
read your Bible ? Do you ever go to church ?
Do you ever pray ? I would have gone into
the most abject poverty for you ?I would have
starved ?faced death ?anything.?
? I will get you and the child away, and I
will face it,? he said in a quavering voice.
? The shame is the same.?
? Then I will hide.?
?Oh ! ? she cried. ? That is worse. Leave
me. Oh, be quiet! Let me think. Is it dis-
covered yet ? ?


? Eichard?s father was in this street to-night.
He almost ran into me ?and them. They were
coming back from their picnic.?
He broke down again, with his arms upon
the mantelpiece and his head bowed upon them.
More than ever he looked like an overgrown
school-boy.
Ellen went out of the room quickly, for that
sight was more than she could bear.
She went into the front room and locked
herself in with her misery.
But he who had sinned slept.
He lay down beside his little golden-haired
daughter and drew her into his arms.
He looked at her reverently. The soft, small
face, pure as a snowdrop, was his own. His
very own. The red baby mouth that he was
fond enough of kissing, that was his own, too.
The golden hair, the wee hand, the rounded
arms. His breath came hard, and he tried to
gulp down this new sharp pain.
But the little one stirred and smiled in her
sleep. Then she did a soft, sweet thing that
perhaps her guardian angel whispered her to do.
She moved nearer and nestled close to his breast,
and she threw one tiny, embracing arm round
his neck.
He fell asleep smiling.
In the morning Ellen came back and found
them so. She set her lips sternly and bent over
her child. She had to open Selwyn?s hand to
free the little pink palm.


?Eh ? ? said Selwyn, waking up quickly.
?Eh ? Yes. Eh ? ?
Then he remembered.
?Pearls before swine?? he said half-ques-
tioningly.
But she carried her child away without
replying.


CHAPTER VIII
The hall door stood wide open, and the sun-
shine was streaming in where the night wind
had been.
In the hall Mary and Philip had a row of
chairs and were playing wonderful games with
them.
Philip?s face was hot and excited. He was
coatless and had his little ragged shirt-sleeves
rolled up. In a shrill, highly-pitched voice he
was issuing orders, such as, ? Main in the jib
mast! Pull up the anchor ! All hands over-
board?man dwoning ! ? Then a frantic leap
over chair-backs, a reckless plunge, and a comical
little figure squirming all over the bare floor.
Mary always followed where Philip led. It
took her a long time to climb over the chair-
backs, and she always lowered herself very care-
fully to the floor. But as she went she repeated
his words in a cooing, babyish way.
She was just over her last chair-back and
swinging her arms imitative of the now squirm-
ing Philip when a tall grey-suited man, in a
felt hat, walked up to the door.
73


? Man dwoning ! Man dwoning ! ? she panted,
stretching one little fat leg down to the ground.
? All the whales and fings keep getting in
fwont of me so I can hardly see,? puffed Philip.
? Does a Mr. AUars live here ? ? asked the man.
Philip stood up instantly.
? I ?spect were in your way,? he said. ?Do
you want to come in ? ?
?Pm not quite sure. Does Mr. Allars live
here ? ?
? He?s my farver,? said Philip.
The man said ? Pheugh ! ? and stood still.
Then they looked at each other searchingly.
What Philip saw was a sharp, thin face with a
few wrinkles, quick grey eyes, and a nose like an
eagle?s beak. What the man saw was an eager
child-face, with shining dark eyes under a tangle
of dark curls.
? Run in,? he said at last, peremptorily, ? run
in and tell your father I wish to see him.?
?My farver and Felise and I live upstairs,?
said Philip, ? and uncle Selwyn and my auntie
and Mary live down. Who do you want to
see ? ?
He reared himself up against the wall, with
his hands behind him.
? I want to see your father,? said the stranger.
Philip set off upstairs, followed by the man.
He had a quick, uneven way of climbing, putting
up his right foot to each step and drawing his
left one to it. An eminently childish way.
? And do you want to see my mamma? ? he
asked.


?Er ?hardly.?
The child wheeled round.
? Don?t you like her ? ? he asked.
? I don?t know her. Go on ; go on.?
Philip went forward once more.
? Do you know my farver ? ? he asked.
?Well ?er ?slightly. I?ve spoken to him;
and I?ve thrashed him once or twice.?
? Oh ! ? exclaimed Philip, his eyes very wide.
? Now go on, my boy ; go on. Hurry up 1 ?
They reached the landing.
? Did you hit him wiv a stwap ? ? asked
Phihp.
?Ay, and a stick and a rope-end.?
The child stood still, and planted his back
against a closed door.
?My farver isn?t at home,? he said.
? You young limb ! What did you bring me
up for, then ? Where is he ? ?
? He?s gone out fishing,? said the child. ? You
better clear down again.?
His face was red, his eyes shining.
? Thank you. I?ll sit down and wait.?
Philip folded his little bare arms across his
chest, and stood firm.
? You can?t wait here,? he said. ? Our mad
dog?s shut up here, and a lot more fings.?
The man put his hand on the door.
? I?ll wait,? he said.
Philip turned round, and flung himself at the
door.
? Here?s a man come to fwash you, father,? he
shouted. ?Be quick; I?m holding him back!


My farver?s got a lot of stones in there, at he
will frow at you,? he added.
The man laughed, lifted the child aside, and
opened the door.
Then he stood still.
It was a bare room he was looking into, bare
and poverty-stricken. In the centre stood a
small deal uncovered table, and before this
Eichard was sitting, his arms outspread, and his
head bowed down upon them.
Philip felt his shoulders gripped hard.
? hemme go ! ? he cried, his voice full of fear.
He shook himself free, and rushed over to the
table. ?Wake up, farver,? he cried, ?he?s come
to fwash you ! Get up quick, farver.?
Richard raised his head; his face was perfectly
white, and his eyes looked dazed. But when he
saw the man standing behind his small son, a
wave of red rushed up to his forehead and his
glance fell.
? I want Selwyn as well as you,? said the
stranger.
? No; you only want me,? said Eichard.
Then he straightened himself, and stood upright.
For a space the men stood looking into each
other?s faces. Then a sudden wave of life seemed
to rush through the elder one.
? Curse her! ? he said, almost savagely.
Eichard started.
? Not her,? he said. ? Not her, father ?but
me. Curse me.?
? She has dragged you down to it; and curse
her, I say.?


Richard put his little son on to the landing,
and closed the door.
? Not a word against her; not a word ! ? he
said, coming back and facing his father half
wildly. ?Though you are my father I won?t
stand it?l ?
? Where is she ?this woman ? ?
? She has gone out,? said Richard, his eyes
glowing; ?but she will be back soon.?
?Itis a lie ! She has left you, and you know it.?
At that Richard sat down and buried his face
in his hands; he could bear no more with a
brave face.
? Good heavens, man ! do you know what you
have done ? Do you know why I am here ? ?
his father burst out.
? Yes,? answered Richard, dully ; ? I?m a
forger. I?ve used your name to the extent of
ten pounds.?
? And a thousand.?
Richard sprang up.
? A thousand ! ? he shouted
? Ah ! ? said his father, breathing hard.
For a space they stared at each other again,
then Richard dropped down heavily into his
chair.
? Well ? ? demanded his father.
?Nothing,? mumbled Richard from behind his
hands, ?except ?I ?l didn?t think you had
found that out.?
His father?s face seemed to grow grey. He
moved mechanically over to the door. All was
done he had come for.


?I?l was going to give the thing to the
police,? he said slowly; ?but, somehow, the
thought came to me that you ?
?I ? l don?t much care if you hang me,? said
Eichard.
His father went on. At the door he looked
over his shoulder for a moment.
Eichard leapt forward.
?A. word 1? he cried. ? One word,? his voice
broke, ? father ! If I have sinned, God knows I
have suffered. A word?one little one ?
His father reached the head of the staircase,
stopped, went on, stopped.
?God spare me the sight of your face again,?
he said.
Then he went downstairs slowly, head bent,
shoulders bent. In the hall he came face to
face with Selwyn. He laughed hoarsely at the
sight of his white face and frightened eyes.
? !? he said, ? marriage appears to agree
with you both.?
Selwyn sighed.
We made our beds,? he said, ? and we expect
to die on them.?
And the sooner the better. Look, you;
Eichard is a damned rascal, and I don?t know
how much better or worse you are.?
Selwyn started.
This much different,? he said in a low quick
way, ? that I would shoot myself before I would
injure the man who was better than my father to
me.?
The other man stopped short and looked hard


at the white boyish face. Then he walked
quickly down the hall, and out of the front
door.
And Selwyn returned to the solitude and
silence of the front room.


CHAPTER IX
Just between daylight and dark Richard came
downstairs. He walked slowly with head and
shoulders bent.
The door of the front room was ajar, and
Selwyn watched him from within. He saw him
stumble among the chairs and toys, and in a
dull, patient way put them aside. He saw him
stand still and look down at his little busy son.
He watched anxiously, pressing towards the
door.
? Going out, farver ? ? Philip asked.
Richard did not answer.
? Going to bwing Felise home ? ?
Richard groaned.
The child reared a walking-stick, that repre-
sented a fiery steed, against the wall.
? Woa?woa ?there,? he said, then looked
round again. ?Didn?t know you had a farver,
too,? he continued, in a sociable little w T ay.
? Thought only little boys and girls had farvers.
Not farvers ?emselves. Has your farver got a
farver ? ?
? Come here to me, laddie,? Richard said in a
broken voice.


?In a minute. Wait till I tie up this fellow.
He keeps kicking wiv his fwont legs and kicking
wiv his back legs till it makes it hard for a
person to hold on. And did you like your
farver ? ?
He left his steed at last and went down the
hall. Eichard stooped and lifted him into his
arms. He passed his hand over the short, unruly
curls. He kissed the little earnest face again
and again. Then he put him down abruptly
and went out.
Selwyn came from the front room, Ellen from
the back.
? Where are you going ? ? she asked quietly.
He started and hesitated.
Philip took up the question. ?Oh, just out
to shoot a few bears and tings,? he said, seizing
his stick and leaping upon it.
? Out,? said Selwyn shortly, and picking up a
hat.
?"V ery well. Only?leave Eichard alone.?
? Why, specially ? He knows nothing yet.?
? I have such horrible feelings. I have such
horrible dreams.? She began to sob, trying not to
cry. ? I implore you, Selwyn, to leave Eichard
alone.?
Selwyn looked sullen. ? I?m not going near
him,? he said.
He went out, Down towards the street end
was Eichard, walking very slowly. His face was
set towards South Head.
Selwyn hurried after him and caught him up
at the corner.


All day long lie had been weaving plans and
trying to see a clear way out ?an easy, unhurt-
ful way out of this tangle of wrong-doing.
A confession, one that would lay a half ?and
that the better one ?of his soul bare was his
latest resolve.
He reminded himself that Richard was gener-
ous, that he loved him with no fearful half-love,
and that Felise had sinned also.
But his plans were very feeble and only half
formed, and he remembered with sorrow their
quarrel of a few days ago.
He passed Richard with his head bent and his
eyes on the ground. He looked like a man whom
all the world was against.
So they walked on a few yards, slowly and
alone.
Then suddenly Selwyn wheeled round and
came back. ? I can?t do it, Dick,? he said
huskily?? I can?t do it.?
Richard looked up. He had not seen him.
? Give me your hand,? continued Selwyn,
? and forget the past.?
He grasped the down-hanging arm by the
wrist and swung it backwards and forwards.
They turned into another road now and walked
on, straight towards the Heads.
? Where are you going ? ? asked Selwyn pre-
sently.
Richard laughed wildly. ?To the devil,? he
said.
? Then I'll go with you,? said Selwyn promptly,
and at that they both laughed.


That was a little better. Selwyn flung one
arm over his friend?s shoulder, and they walked
on in school-boy fashion together. Selwyn knew
better than to break the silence. He knew, too,
the gratitude and relief that must be in Richard?s
heart, because one, the friend of all his past, had
volunteeied to take the wide road to destruction
by his side, and was tramping thus gripping his
shoulder. But Selwyn had limited his silence to
this road. He allowed the way back for his half-
confession, and tried to arrange his points. At
the turning-place, however, Richard still kept on.
The road they were in now was bordered by rock
and scrubland, and led over sheer cliffs to the
sea.
Felise vont come back?yet,? remarked
Selwyn, as though he had just arrived at a
conclusion.
? How much do you know ? ? asked Richard
hoarsely.
Just this much,? replied Selwyn, gripping a
little harder. ? That I found her doingTlLd
remonstrated with her. Before Heaven�Dick I
thought when I left her she had given it up
She was so sorry. She cried so. She seemed
heart-broken. And it was only for ten pounds.?
Look here, whispered Richard with a sob in
his throat. ? Read this.?
He brought out a crumpled piece of paper.
. 6 gathering darkness made reading almost
impossible but Selwyn spread out the paper on
the palm of his hand. Then he struck a match
and stood still to read.


Richard waited by his side and watched his
face.
And this is what he read ?
? This is from Felise the miserable, to tell you,
Richard, that I am going away from you to-night
?now. Even while you are reading this iam
travelling to put as large a space of the world
as I can between my beloved and my sell. Roy,
dearest, I have what you call forged your father s
name for ten pounds. lam as you will say in
shame and full of disgrace?therefore 1 shall
creep into a corner of the world and hide me, so
that the shame cannot be brought home to you
nor to our Philip. 1 reasoned that your father
had so much, and our Nena?did she not want
largely ? And with that money I purchased tor
her much happiness. Oh, boy, dearest, had they
not found me out, I should have been so good.
And I would have grown great, and then happi-
ness would have come. Now?all is over. 1
shall see you no more. Never more. Rut all
through the long years without you my arms will
be empty because of you, and my heart will-be
hungry always. And on my lips no kisses shall
ever fall, for my lips ?are they not yours, and
shall they not be yours for ever ?
J ? Felise.
Selwyn had to strike three matches to read it
through. It seemed very long to him, and he
wondered all the time what he was going to say
when he came to the end of it.


He folded it up carefully, tenderly almost,
and handed it back to Richard.
? That is only the beginning,? said Richard,
beginning to walk on again. ? I must tell you
the rest. Doesn?t it strike you as strange, Wyn
?doesn?t it strike you as devilishly strange,
that while she was forging one cheque, I was
another ? Why couldn?t I do it, and serve for
us both, old man ? ?
? You! ? cried Selwyn, turning to him and
staring in bewilderment. ?You! Great heavens!?
Richard stared on feverishly.
?Even I!? he said bitterly??l, to rob my
own father! Put it into words, Wyn, and
strike me dead with reproaches if you can!
Only, for the sake of our old friendship, keep
it between you and your own soul about Felise ! ?
He seemed to be choking down his heart.
? What was your sum?? asked Selwyn, in a
dry, hard voice.
?Mine ??mine was a thousand pounds,? said
Richard wildly.
Then Selwyn knew what it was his friend
was doing. He was wrapping a black cloak of
sin over his whiteness, and calling it his?
his own, because he believed it belonged to
Felise.
And who was there to tell him that it was not
Felise at all, but himself?Selwyn ?
Richard watched him furtively.
? I m waiting for you to give me your pledge,
old man,? he said.
But Selwyn shook his head.


? Wait a bit,? he said. ? Wait a bit, Dick.
All that?s a lie, you know.?
Richard turned round. His face whitened
under its sunburnt skin.
? Why is it a lie ? What do you mean ? ? he
demanded.
Selwyn felt that he was running away from
himself. He pulled up for a minute.
?Felise forged,? he began, ? and ? then
he stopped. ? First of all,? he said, ? remember
what I said about her and Bright ?
?If you say that to me again,? said Richard,
? I?ll strike you down?there, where you stand.?
? Oh, no, you won?t! Easy a bit! Easy,
Dick ! You have been telling a splendid lie,
old man, thinking to shield Felise, and all the?
ah ! steady there, Dick ! the devil ?
He swung round, one fist ready clenched, the
other hand spread out ready for guard. In his
face was white blind passion from Richard?s
heavy blow.
He forgot every honourable motive, Felise and
the world. Only his anger flamed up into such
madness, that he was as one drunken. With a
muttered oath he lunged forward, to strike him
whose shoulder he had just now been em-
bracing.
The next second they were locked in each
other?s arms, fighting breast to breast, eyes
glaring, breath rushing and panting, there with
the grey rock under their feet, and whitened
sky above their heads.
They were both so young and strong, both so


reckless and desperate, that it would seem they
were striving for each other?s very life.
The pale stars came out coldly, they were
fighting still, with bated breaths and blanched
faces. And a purple billowy cloud floated over
the sky, and they were fighting still. And it
crept up close to the silvery face of the moon,
closer and closer, and then they were not
fighting. And it touched the moon and blotted
out her smile from the gaze of the earth, and
they were both still.
For one was afraid, with the beginnings of the
most terrible and desolate fear in the world, and
the other was dead.
For a space the cloud flung a shadow over the
earth, and over the spot where the two living
men had been. Then it passed away into darker
sky regions, where other clouds were piled cloud
upon cloud, in a universe of black and purple.
Then one trod softly, with creeping stealthy
tread, away towards the silent bushland.
But he came back again. Back over the scrub
and the sand to the dead man?s side. And he
stooped and raised his head from the death-
striking jagged rock, and lifted him into his
arms. Then he bore him forward towards the
cliffs and the sea.
And as he walked the moon was hidden once
more by a cloud, and he trod through the dark-
ness with the dead. And he felt secure almost,
because he remembered not that with God dark-
ness and light are as one.
When he came to the cliff edge and heard the


beating and the surging and the swelling of the
ocean, and thought of the number of the dead
sleeping in those vast depths, he felt calmer.
Surely there was room there for one other
sleeper ? Surely this cold awful secret would
be safe down there in the ocean with the dead
and the deep, deep silence ?
He went into a little patch of bush and laid
down his burden. The white rigid face stared
at him. He drew back shuddering. It stared
pitilessly. Then with one wild cry he sprang
away and fled through the night.


CHAPTER X
It was midnight on the sea. Midnight full of
the hushed peace and holiness that we ascribe to
eternity and death.
The harbour lay like a dark sheet of glass
with an uneven edge under a wdiite starless sky.
Here and there was a red light, or a blue, or a
golden, where a vessel was moored, and over the
water there came at intervals the long white
rays from the revolving light at South Head.
Round by the harbour edge a small boat was
shooting. She kept among the shore shadows,
and went silently, almost as they lay.
On and on she went, drawing nearer and
nearer to the grim outline the Heads made
between sky and sea. Then she slipped round
and gained the water-stretch between the harbour
and the ocean.
Here the land and the moon made long streaks
upon the waters.
The boat laboured through, and at last turned
round to the south and rode on over the waves
of the ocean.
After awhile she made slowly for land. It
was dangerous, for the waves surged to the foot
89


of sheer cliffs. But she sped along, and then
shot swift as an arrow almost into a little
opening where a little patch of sand lay at the
foot of the rocks.
Then one stepped from her, walking through
water as deep as his waist, and drew her land-
ways and fixed her to a rock.
Then swiftly and silently he scaled and
climbed to the heights above. Only one whom
death had stared in the face and threatened and
terrified dared have attempted it. Only one fleet-
footed, agile, and strong, would have succeeded.
At last he stood there, high above the water,
far down beneath the sky. Alone, guilt-stricken,
desperate. He went on, on, on, through the
silence and over the rocks, till he came to a
white road. Then, torn, bleeding, weary as he
was, he ran, swiftly and painfully, till he came
to one separate, lonely little patch of scrubland.
He plunged in amongst the darkness, fearfully,
tremblingly, till he stood where a white, dead
face stared up to God.
And he gasped and panted and sobbed tear-
lessly. Then he stooped and raised the burden
slowly into his arms, and put it on his shoulder
and set out again toward the sea.
At the end of the white track he looked back-
wards. And then did a great fear and trembling
fall upon him, so that he laid his burden down
and fell face downwards upon the ground.
For there in a line behind him was a mark,
and he knew that it was blood, the blood of
himself and this strange, still friend.


For a space that seemed longer than all the
years of his life gone by, he lay there. He saw
himself as boy, youth, and man, and him who
had been closer than a brother as boy, youth,
and man also. He saw them going over the
pleasant places and up the steppes of the world
hand clasped. He saw their wives and little
innocent children, and a great and terrible cry
broke from his lips.
Then he rose up again, and without one back-
ward glance carried his burden as before, and
went down the face of the cliff, down to the
beautiful sea.
And he felt when he stood at the bottom that
he had climbed from the region of all love and
purity in unconsciousness and bewilderment, and
yet of his own strength, to the nethermost abyss
where the damned are for evermore.
He almost tottered through the water to the
boat. He slid the heavy rigid body into the
boat, where he had spread a sail out to receive
him. And he climbed over the boat?s side in to
him, and he bound him up all but his head and
weighted him. And he bowed his knees to God,
there in the boat, and he beat his breast, and a
cry broke from his lips and fled over the water.
Then he stooped towards the smileless stern face,
and laid a kiss upon the cold forehead ; and he,
with a brother?s blood upon his hands, sent a
heart prayer to the white heights of Heaven that
God would bless this dead man and receive him
unto Himself. And he kissed him again, and
covered up his face.


Then he pushed out from the shore, and they
went away together over the sea, the dead man
and the living. But his hands were nerveless,
and he could not ply the oars, so that the waves
carried them which ways soever they listed.
And the wind played with them, and spun them
round, carrying them further south. Again and
again did the white flash from the lighthouse
pass over them ; until, suddenly, the boat was
tossed round by a billow too far to right herself,
and shot arrow-wise over the next great w'ave.
So she lay still and quivered, and received a
mighty ocean mountain upon her side. At that
she turned slowly over.
And the sea opened black and cold, and the
shrouded form sank down and down into the still
depths, until that time when there shall be no
more any death nor any sea. And one rode over
the waves alone, his hands clinging to an oar,
and his face staring upwards and forwards over
the midnight ocean waves.


PART II
CHAPTER I
Upstairs in Felise?s room the daylight was
giving place to soft strange shadows.
& Philip, standing in the doorway, was staring
at them with widely-opened startled eyes, and
trying to define them.
Downstairs in the gaslight were Ellen and
Mary, but he had stolen away from them to ? go
home.?
There was an ache at his heart that demanded
father or mother, and that not Ellen?s tenderest
gentleness could have softened.
Besides, she was not very gentle with him just
now, or only in a fitful impulsive way strange in
her. To-night she had appeared to forget him.
She had put Mary to bed more like a careless
nursemaid than a loving mother. The good-
night kiss was bestowed coldly; there was no
lullaby, no game of ? peek-a-boo ? with a baby-
face and a mosquito net. Then she had gone
away down the hall and into the front room, and
knelt down by the window.
93


For awhile Philip found enjoyment in that
bed-time had come, and he was still up. And
he kept very still and chuckled to himself, and
felt sorry for Mary.
Then, perhaps because he was so tired, perhaps
because he had not seen her for five whole days
now, a cry rose up in his heart for his own mother
and his own bed.
So he left a row of sticks that represented
soldiers and went ?home.?
But how chill and silent it was ! How the
shadows grew and grew in mystery and size,
and mocked at him just because he was small
and alone.
He knew that corner gloom was the place
where his mother kept her gowns, and his father
his suits, but he said in a whisper, ?It?s just like
a camel without a hump,? and he stared hard at it.
And this other corner quite close to him, with
the crouching bending form, how weird and
dreadful it was !
He felt like bounding forward one moment
and rushing away the next. But he stood his
ground, and putting out one hand knocked loudly
on the door. He tried to make his voice sound
deep and manlike, but it quavered and ran over
the room so oddly that the very shadows seemed
to laugh at him.
?Hi ! Any one in there ?? he said.
He had never been afraid of the dark in his
life, but a little hot feeling ran over him when
he saw the ?camel without the hump? move
upwards and forwards.


? Hi 1 ? he said again, and trembling greatly.
? Where?d I put my gun now ? Bless me ! ?
He turned to go downstairs, but a long low
?ssh ?boy,? arrested him.
He hesitated a second longer, then bounded
forward across the room and into warm loving
arms.
And the ache ran away out of his heart,
because this was his own mother, and he was in
his own home.
She said to him whisperingly, with her lips on
his cheeks, ? Boy is going to be a man. A man
like his brave father.?
He said ? Yes,? sobbing in his relief and sense
of something dreadful present.
? And boy is going to try to grow up like his
dear father, because some day, some beautiful
day, papa will come back and stay with us for
always.?
? Where is he ? ? asked Philip.
But his mother cried bitterly.
? Oh, boy,? she said, with her cheek upon his,
?I am going out into the world to seek him.
He is not dead ! He is not dead ! Ah, pray to
the good God that it is not he?Richard ! ?
O a _
She raised him in her arms and carried him
over to the bed. ?For the last, last time for
many weary days,? she whispered, ? perhaps for
ever.? She kissed him again and again, laying
him down.
And he fixed his eyes upon her beautiful
white face and waited for her next words. But
she sat silently watching and caressing him, and


his lids fell to, and opened again, and fell to,
and opened half-way, and then fell to, and
fluttered and lay still. And a deep sigh parted
his lips, so long and deep that before it had
ended it had wafted him away into the sweet
mazy paths of dreamland.
And then, a long, long while afterwards, it
seemed to him, that he saw the sun rolling and
falling through the sky, and that at last it came
right down to the earth for him and Mary to
leap at and play with. And it shone into his eyes
and almost blinded him, so that he put out his
hands to turn it away. But another hand took
his and held it, and soft lips caressed it.
He smiled and said, ? Mamma, look out?the
sun ?you are tweading on it.?
Then, a long way off?it seemed from some-
where behind the sun ?his mother spoke.
She said, ? I am going away, Mr. Allars, I am
going away where I shall see him never more. I
have accepted your terms ?they are cruel and
hard, but I have accepted them. Philip shall not
remember his father, and you shall teach him to
forget his mother.?
Then Philip struggled to find her, but a great
light was blazing into his eyes so that he could
not open them. And he lost the sound of the
voices and went a great way off to chase a
butterfly.
When he found them again, a harsh one was
saying?
? Pray to your God, madam, that your hus-
band is dead. It is my prayer, though he is my


son. The living man is a murderer ?so sure as
there is death for us all.?
And Ellen?s voice broke in sobbingly ?
? But both may be dead ?Felise ?Felise
both are dead. How do they know that one was
saved ??
Then a long time of uneasiness and terror
came to Philip, in which he flew through space
on a walking-stick that had tiresome ? ways.?
And he whipped up his stick and flew and flew
and flew, because behind was another man with
ropes and sticks and straps, come to beat his
father. And he felt him coming closer and
closer, and he heard him speaking louder and
nearer, and his heart told him with a great throb
that it was the ? bogey? man.
Then his walking-stick slipped away and he
could not catch it, and the earth slipped away
and he could not stand, and the sun went
whirling round and round, and there was no one
to see or know but just himself and this sharp-
faced ? bogey ? man.
He gave a great start and his eyes flew open,
and he saw around him a soft blue darkness full
of strange far-away sounds, and above, a sky of
twinkling golden stars, and in front, a horse?s tail
that kept appearing above a black patch and
then disappearing again. And he heard the
sound of horses? feet over stones, and he felt that
he was driving, driving at a great speed. But
whether on the earth or the sun, he was not
sure.
Then he looked to his side and upwards,


Here, close to him, was the dread man of his
dream thoughts.
How his eyes glittered ! What a long
hooked nose he had, and what a lono- grey
beard.
?Well,? said the harsh sharp voice, ?are you
going to cry \ ?
At that Philip felt a little hot, because he had
wanted very much to cry. But he gulped some-
thing down in his throat and sat boldly upright.
Then he stared very hard into the man?s eyes
and said, ?I?m twying to fink where lam. It
gives a person sus a funny feeling not to know
where he is.?
And the great man laughed a grating hard
laugh that w~as not pleasant to listen to, and that
shook the seat they were sitting on.
?Now I come to think of it,? he said,
? you?re the young limb who owned the mad
dog.?
Then Philip?s heart quaked and sank within
him.
? No,? he said, ? I was only zust fwitening you
a bit.?
At which the man laughed again, until it
seemed a grave remembrance came to him, when
suddenly the laugh went away, and he sat
staring out into the night with an expression
half ferocious, half sad.
Philip put up a petition to be taken home, but
it was not heeded. He asked for his mother
with his lips trembling and his eyes heavy with
tears, but no notice was taken of that either.


Then a cry ran from his lips out into the night,
a wild, frightened cry for ? Farver, farver ! ?
But a heavy hand fell on his shoulder and a
stern voice bade him be silent, so that he choked
back his next half-uttered cry and sat, a little
huddled-up heap, in his corner of the cab.
Then they drove into a region of cabs and
omnibuses and many lights. The shriek of
engines smote Philip?s ears, and he recognised
with a great heart-throb that they were at the
railway station.
Plis breast heaved for one tumultuous minute,
the next he was lifted out and stood down, a
morsel of a boy among that great throng.
There darted through his mind a determination
to save himself from a terrible fate, and he
clenched his hands and set off at the top of his
speed down the crowded platform. Under men?s
arms he darted, over boxes, past trollies, regard-
less of everything on earth except making his
escape from his eagle-nosed captor.
With a loud cry he flung himself before a little
white-looking lady.
? Save me ! Save me ! ? he cried, clutching
her skirts. ? Oh, save me ! He s stealing me ! ?
But a hand seized his shoulder, and he was
swung up into strong arms that felt like iron
bands around him, swung up and borne away
down the platform. He shut his eyes for one
dizzy minute, and when he opened them, he and
this terrible man were alone in a railway carriage.
? I?don?t want ?to be?stole,? he said, with
heaving chest.


The man looked at him consideringly.
? How old are yon ? ? he asked at last.
? Six and a bit,? replied Philip.
? Then,? said the man, ? you are old enough
to understand what I am going to tell you. I am
your grandfather, and am taking you home to
live with me. You will live w T ith me always, and
do as I tell you ?always.?
? But,? persisted Philip, ? I want my farver
and my mamma.?
?You have neither father nor mother. You
have no one in the world but me.?
? But I don?t want you. I want my own
farver and my own mamma.?
The train went whizzing onwards, through
darkness into darkness. Philip repeated his
statement two or three times, ? I want my own
farver and my own mamma,? but his grandfather
took not the remotest notice. Instead, he undid
a strap of rugs and threw one over to the opposite
seat.
?Fix yourself up in that and go to sleep,
youngster,? he said.
But Philip sat upright and rubbed his knuckles
into his eyes.
? I want ?to go home ! ? he quavered.
? You?re going. Lie down ?Philip ! ?
Such a Philip. Sharp, loud, and full of stern-
ness. Not such a one had entered into his life
before.
He threw himself down precipitately, and
cuddled up to the seat back as though it were a
friend.


? Now go to sleep.?
He closed his eyes at once. Two long half-
strangled sobs ran round the carriage, then came
a few little pitiful hiccoughs, so heartbroken that
Felise would have wept to hear them. Then a
silence, broken only by the noise of the train and
the occasional rustling of a newspaper.
And sleep came to him in the silence, and
joyous memories, and of all his beloveds there
was not one that he missed.
And the night wore on and grew old, and day
rose blushing and half afraid over tree-covered
hills. But still the train sped onwards, and still
Philip slept. They left the hills behind them,
and came to where all the earth seemed one
great brown-green plain, and still they sped on.
On, on, on, till they left the plain behind them
too, and went near and nearer to the foot of a
green high mountain range that ran horizon-wise
across all of the earth before them.
Then it was day. A day of goldenness and
blazing heat.
Philip turned over, rubbed his knuckles into
his eyes, and awoke. And at the same moment
the train stopped. Then another stern ? Philip?
sounded through the carriage.
?Jump out,? said his grandfather, ?and run
over to a buggy with a black boy in it, and get in.?
But Philip hesitated and his lip began to
tremble.
His grandfather looked at him from over that
eagle nose of his?such a look, and with never a
word at all, behind or before it!


He dropped down from his seat at once, sped
through the open door, and across the platform
to where three high shabby-looking buggies were
standing.
*=> . , . . .
At each one he stared inquiringly, but it was
at the third that he stopped. It possessed two
horses and one seat, and upon the seat, holding
the reins, was a very small brown man.
?Hi ! are you a black boy ? ? shouted Philip
from far below.
? Eh 1 ? said the man.
Philip looked over his shoulder and saw his
grandfather, bag-laden, approaching.
?Quick ! Get me up, quick!? he said fearfully.
? Clear off,? said the man gruffly.
But after one more glance over his shoulder,
Philip scrambled up by aid of the wheel and a
little perched-up step.
? Are you a black boy ? ? he demanded again,
staring into the man?s face. His grandfather
threw in his bundle of rugs and swung himself
up the other side.
?Eh ? Wot d?ye think ? ? asked the man,
grinning from ear to ear, and staring back into
the little questioning face.
? I fink you?re only bwoned,? said Philip.
? Sit down,? said his grandfather. ? Here, on
the rugs.?
Then he seized the reins and away they flew.
Philip had never, even in his imagination, which
was studded with fiery steeds, been behind such
horses as these.
Up hill, down hill, over plain, it was all the


same, all one mad, wild canter. For a space his
heart was fluttering in his throat and his face was
white because of his fear that he dare not put
into words.
At last his grandfather spoke.
? Richard?s boy/? he said shortly. ? I suppose
you?ve read it all in the papers. Either your
boy or mine is a murderer ?confound it! This
last and a mighty whip-lash to a stumbling horse.
? Tis yours,? said the browm man. ? I?ve
read.?
? I wouldn?t stake my life either way. It
appears they hadn?t quarrelled, so the Lord only
knows why they fought.?
? Wot makes ?em say one ?scaped beats me.?
? It?s mere surmise. I?m inclined to think
one?s murdered and t?other?s drowned.?
Another space of silence. Then ?
? Why didn?t Numa come to meet me ? ? asked
Mr. Allars.
? Becos I did.?
They drove on for something like six miles
without another word.
Philip plucked up courage to look around him.
They were amongst trees, driving through what
seemed to be trackless bush. Every now and
again they would jolt over a fallen tree-branch,
rattle down horrid ruts, flash sideways over the
earth till the little brown man seemed almost on
the ground and Philip stared up into his grand-
father?s face, which looked level with the tree-
tops.
At last they swerved round and stood still.


The brown man put two fingers to his lips and
gave a long piercing whistle. When they moved
on again some one leapt upon the step and a
young black face shone down into Philip?s. The
suddenness of its appearance made him draw back.
The black face expressed amazement and
incredulity.
? Think him debil?debil 1 Haw ! Ha ! ? said
the brown man, which struck even Philip as a
lengthy sentence to fall from his lips.
Philip sat wordless.
? This Massa Philip,? said Mr. Allars, with his
eyes horsewards.
? Massa Feelip ! ? said the black boy, with a
large smile on his lips.
? Yes. You teach him swim, ride, shoot!
Now?down, damn you, and hold the horses.?
The brown man hopped down one side, and
Philip felt himself gripped by one arm and
swung downwards till his little dangling legs
reached mother earth. Then he tottered and
rolled about like one drunken, because his feet
had forgotten the way to stand.
? Ee ?ee ?ee I ? said the black boy, laughing
at him from under the horses? heads.
? Eh ? Haw ! Ha ! ? said the brown man with
a hideous cackle.
? Hurry up to the house, youngster,? said his
grandfather.
Philip hurried blindly forward. In front of
him stood a large weatherboard cottage, but
between him and it were three unfriendly-look-
ing dogs.


He half stopped. Beside him was his grand-
father watching him with sharp dark eyes.
? Hurry now ! ? he said.
So Philip walked forward past the dogs, which
bounded round him and sniffed at him and
growled, on to the house.
And his bravery arose out of his great fear.
? Look at that! ? exclaimed his grandfather.
? Eh ? ? said the little brown man.


CHAPTER II
In all the house there was not a woman.
Philip had not accepted this as a fact without
investigation, but now, after three days, he sor-
rowfully acknowledged it.
He had searched everywhere. Numa made
the beds, Numa swept out the rooms, Numa
scrubbed the floors.
Even in the kitchen there was nothing more
suggestive of a petticoat than a large white
apron. And that enveloped the fattest and
ugliest black fellow Philip had ever seen. His
name was Caesar, and he cooked the dinners and
washed the clothes and ? wiped up ? the dishes.
Besides Caesar and Numa, no one lived in the
house but Philip, his grandfather, and the small
brown man.
No, there was not a woman anywhere. Hav-
ing reached that conclusion Philip sat down
tailor-fashion on the boards of the large wide
hall and considered the position.
His grandfather passed him, stood at the door,
switched a whip on his leggings and whistled.
He had done that yesterday morning too.
Then Numa appeared leading a thin, un-
-106


groomed horse, with a yellow sheep-dog follow-
ing. That also had happened yesterday.
Philip watched listlessly. He was feeling de-
pressed still from this discovery of his about the
womanless condition of this house.
? Philip,? said his grandfather in his brisk
quick way, ? what are you doing ? ?
? Pm finking,? said Philip sorrowfully.
? H?m. Bad plan. Get up, boy.?
Philip rose at once, moreover he drew closer
to his dread relative.
? I?m finking,? he said, ? that I can?t find any
ladies about anywdiere,?
? Why?what do you want with the ladies ? ?
asked his grandfather, an amused twinkle coming
into his eyes.
? I w r ant ?zust a few,? said Philip. ?It gives
a person sus a funny feeling to find ony men
everywhere. You know what it is to keep
aspecting to see a lady, and to keep aspecting,
and then to find ony a black man.?
He raised his face upwards and his eyes looked
misty.
His grandfather laughed and called ? Tom.?
Then the little brown man came dow r n the
hall, and he switched a whip on his leggings and
stood at the front door. And he put his two
fingers to his lips and whistled his owm shrill
whistle.
? Eh ? ? he said, without looking round.
? Only,? said Mr. Allars, ? Philip w T ants a few r
ladies. Do you know where there are any ? ?
He looked down into the childish face?? When


any ladies come round here,? he said, ? we shoot
them, and Caesar makes them into goose pies.
Numa ! ?
? Oi, masser.?
?Take Masser Philip to Bilbong Creek and
make him swim like a fish. Now, out of my
way, you fool 1 Hi, Sandy ! Off, boy ! ? That
last to the dog, then a scamper, a whip-flash, and
rider number one had departed.
Philip drew nearer to the little brown man now,
? Where are you going ? ? he asked.
?Eh ? ? asked the little brown man.
? Whose boy are you ? ?
?Eh??
? I said, are you a boy or a man, and why can
you only say A ? I?m only six, but I can say
a lot.?
?Besides yer prayers.?
?Yes,? said Philip; ?and I?ll teach you. I
know down to K, and I can count up to twelve.?
? Eh ? ?
? Marwy ony knowed zust ABC. I was
teaching her.?
� Eh ? ?
? Marwy was Uncle Selwyn?s little girl, you
know. And she took after him.?
The little brown man hopped round, and he
dropped his hand down heavily to the little
shoulder.
? Don?t,? said Philip, ? you?re too heavy.
Ugh ! you?re pinching me.?
? And I?ll smash yer, if ever yer go to say that
name agen.?


? What name ? ? asked the child, half dazed,
half afraid. " Uncle Selwyn?s or Marwy?s 1 ?
? Eh V?
The little brown man swung himself up to his
horse. Then he looked round and whistled, and
a black-and-tan sheep-dog bounded forward.
There was another whip-flash, another scamper
down the weed-grown path, and Philip and
Numa were alone.
They eyed each other closely for several long
minutes. Numa turned away his glance first.
He stooped and picked up five little stones, then
he knelt down near the edge of the verandah,
tossed them up, and caught them on the back of
his hand. He did this several times, and between
each he looked at Philip.
? I can do that,? said Philip at last.
Numa grinned.
? Come on,? he said.
?You no teachee me swimee, then ? ?
? Why ? ? asked Numa.
? Because,? said Philip, ?me cannee swimee
like a fishee.?
At which Numa laughed loudly.
? Come on,? he said, ? and well see.?
But Philip sat still.
? Traid ? ? asked Numa.
? No,? said Philip, standing up and looking
hot and ashamed. ? I?m not afraid. Bah ! ?
?Come on, then,? said Numa stolidly.
He slid off the verandah, and began to walk
down the path. Philip followed slowly. At the
end of the path were two slip-panels wide apart.


Numa took a short run and leapt the highest.
Then he turned and looked at Philip. So Philip
took a short run and leapt the lowest. At which
Numa laughed again.
Then they walked on. Beyond the panels was
bush so dense that hardly a glimpse of the sky
was visible overhead. And the undergrowth was
so thick that the city-bred child could hardly walk.
But Numa looked at him now and again with
a challenging smile, so he struggled on without
a word of comment. Once Numa disappeared,
Philip plodded on.
? Numa,? he called.
There was no reply. He hurried a little.
? Numa,? he called again.
But there was no sound except mysterious
bush whisperings.
Then Philip put his two fingers to his lips in
imitation of the little brown man, and a shrill
small whistle ran forth.
Numa sprang before him, with a smile stretch-
ing from ear to ear.
? ?Fraid ? ? he asked.
?No,? said Philip indignantly. ? Ony I?ve
not been this way before, and we didn?t bwing
any guns, and if a bear should come from behind
a twee, I was finking ?
__ o
Numa laughed.
?No bears here,? he said, ? only snakes and
debil-debils.?
? What are debil-debils ? ?
But Numa only shook his head, and rolled his
eyes about.


And they went on again, Philip keeping closer
to his guide than before.
Suddenly, after much silent plodding, Numa
changed his gait. He leapt in the air, kicked
out his legs, swung his arms about, then bounded
forward, running and singing together.
Philip had to run hard to keep him in sight.
The ground here was grey rock, with ferns and
mosses creeping over. Numa leapt from rock to
rock, singing and flinging out his arms. Suddenly
he stood still.
Philip came up to him wondering greatly. But
when he reached him he understood and shivered.
Down beside this rock was a deep dark stream.
There was no gradual descent, no friendly sand
and little rippling waves. Just a sullen dark
stream into which the rocks ran sheer on either
side.
Numa cast off his clothing, which was scanty,
ran along the rock to w T here one solitary gum-
tree grew in a cleft between that and a neigh-
bouring rock. Then he swung himself up the
tree, and along an outstretching branch.
Philip looked up to him, half fascinated.
? Come on,? said Numa. He laughed and
stood upright on the branch, balancing himself
with his arms. Then he put his two hands
together and shot himself into the stream.
The water smothered itself out in long ripples
and grew still again, and Philip sank down in a
terrified heap on the rock.
He called ? N uma ? sharply, and his heart
beat so that he was almost choking.


Then close to his feet the water parted, and
the black face gleamed up at him.
? Come on,? said Numa. He was laughing
still.
? Oh ! ? said Philip, with an enormous sigh.
? Come on,? urged Numa. ?Be quick.?
But Philip shook his head.
? ?Fraid ! ? asked Numa.
? No,? said Philip slowly.
?Well, come on, fishee! Ha, ha! You tell
me you swimee likee a fishee. Come on, fishee.?
But Philip hung back.
? I don?t know that water,? he said. ? P?waps
I couldn?t swim in that water. You see, it?s new
to me.?
? ?Fraid ? ? asked Numa laconically.
Philip looked at him.
? Yes,? he said quickly.
Then Numa climbed up beside him, and with
cold wet hands began to unfasten his clothes.
Philip struggled mightily, but Numa was very
short with him.
? Might as well,? he said. ? Swim better
without ?em. Anyways, you?re going in.?
It was no use struggling. Philip saw his
clothes in a little heap behind him, and he
shivered for a moment on the rock.
Then Numa lifted him into his arms, and flung
him almost to mid-stream. He went down, of
course; but when he came up, Numa?s face was
just above him, his mouth in one enormous
laugh.
? Now, come on,? said Numa. ? Do?s I do.?


Philip did ?or tried to. He did not sink
again. Whenever his mouth began to go under,
and he felt he was going to the bottom for
certain, some part of Numa would shoot under
him. Either a shoulder, or an arm, or a leg, or
perhaps his back.
So at last, finding Numa lay always between
him and the bottom of the stream, he forgot
about sinking, and struck out with his arms,
and kicked with his legs, and puffed with his
mouth.
?Ha, ha, fishee! Now then, fishee! Come
on, fishee ! ? Numa would say.
But Philip?s heart lay low, because he had said
he was afraid. He looked at Numa, puffing and
spluttering.
? Let?s go back to that wock,? he said, ? and
I?ll jump in.?
?Go ?long!? said Numa. ?You want to get
out.?
? I?ll pwomise you I?ll jump in,? puffed Philip.
So Numa steered him to the rock, and pushed
him up.
? Get out of my way ! Clear the way there !
Now?off! ? panted Philip shrilly. He leapt in,
and sank quite close to the rock. Coming up
again, Numa?s arm was there for him to cling to.
? I?m not ?fwaid,? gasped Philip. ?Pm not
?fwaid.?
? Come on,? said Numa. ? Had ?nough ?
Fishee will want to jump from the tree to-morrow.
Come on.?


CHAPTER 111
That afternoon Philip surveyed the verandah
with his head on one side. It was a wide wooden
verandah, approached by steps and raised about
two feet from the ground. It ran all round the
house, and was fitted with sun-blinds and deck-
chairs.
To Philip its aspect was pleasing. He put his
hands in his pockets and strutted up and down,
and Numa sat on the top step and watched him.
? And down there can be the bedwooms and
places,? he said half aloud ; ? and up to here the
deck. And the blinds can be sails, and the
chairs can be boats. Um ! Numa !
Numa grinned.
? Yes, fishee,? he said,
?Do you fink, Numa, you?d like to be a
sailor-boy, and keep jumping overboard and
fwimming in the sea ? ?
? Wha?s the sea ? ? asked Numa.
Philip waved his hand around.
? All over down there,? he said. ? And I m
the captain, and you?re my boy; and you ve got
to do everything 1 tell you, or be shot.
114


? Wha?s the gun ? ? asked Numa, with one of
his largest smiles.
? ?Tend I?ve got one, of course,? exclaimed
Philip. ?Tell you what, though?we must get
oars.?
? What?m oars ? ?
? Oars are sticks?walking-sticks.?
O
Numa nodded quickly, and darted away.
Presently he returned with a bundle of sticks of
all sizes.
Philip?s eyes gleamed. He fell upon the
bundle with delight, then stopped, eyeing Numa
consideringly.
? I?m twying to fink of a name for you,? he
said. ? What do you say to Harkie, or Davy
Jones, or Jack? Those are all the sailor-boys I
know.?
Numa considered, rubbing one bare foot side-
ways along the boards meantime. At last, after
a lengthy pause, he said ? Davy Jones ? gravely.
? Well, come on, Davy,? said Philip.
But Numa didn?t move. Philip dragged four
chairs down to the path, and fitted them up with
oars. But still Numa was considering his name.
Philip came back to him.
? Come on, Davy,? he said, ? while I ?splain to
you. And listen, so as to save yourself getting
shot. You see this ; well, it?s not a blind any
more?it?s the mainsail. When I say � Haul in
the mainsail,? drop this ; and this is the jibsail;
and this stick?s the anchor. Now, come on. All
those other sticks are men and women. Now,
haul in the anchor, Davy.?


Davy ran obediently forward. Before be
could reach it, however, a series of shrill shrieks
came from Philip. He sprang round. Over his
head, and in all directions, sticks were flying.
The little captain was rushing madly up and
down the boards, dragging off his coat and
shrieking.
? Wha the matter ? ? demanded Davy, rushing
to him.
But Philip pushed him off, and sank down on
the floor.
? All the men and women overboard ! ? he
screamed, unlacing his boots swiftly. ? Save
?em! Over you go, Davy Jones! Swim ?
pull for ?em! Take a header, Davy Jones!?
He himself tore off his last sock, and plunged
on to the sun-parched path. Its heat made him
wince for a moment, but he rushed on, and
climbed into a chair. Then he used his sticks to
such purpose, that the chair moved slowdy back-
wards down the path.
Davy followed, screaming shrilly with delight.
In these chairs they had to reach every ? man
and woman,? and they were scattered all over
that wide grassy sea.
All through that afternoon they toiled in row-
ing. Once or twice they remembered the vessel,
and ? swam ? over to her to lower a sail, or
deposit a saved one.
Towards sunset the little brown man and
Philip?s grandfather rode home. They met each
other about a mile from the cottage and rode
side by side without a word.


They were as hungry and tired as sunset usually
found them, and in the mind of each was a
thought made up of dinner and the after-dinner
smoke.
Nearing the house, Mr. Allars strained his ears
O J
to listen, then he glanced at his companion and
said?
? Did you hear anything ? ?
? Eh ? ? said the brown man.
? Fancied I heard screams.?
The brown man gazed stolidly forward. He
rose with his horse and sat so close to it that it
looked as if he and it were all of a piece.
Mr. Allars sent his horse on a little quicker.
? I?m about sure I can hear Numa yelling,? he
said. ?It means that brute of a Caesar?s on the
burst again, and they?re trying to make an end of
each other.?
? I can ?ear the colt at it, too ! ? said the brown
man.
? Philip ! ? said Mr. Allars. Then he stuck
out his toes and rode faster.
A little later Philip was walking quietly up
the garden path by the side of his grandfather?s
horse. The brown man was close behind ; but
Numa had disappeared like a flash of lightning.
Mr. Allars saw the chairs.
? What are those for ? ? he demanded, pointing
downwards.
Philip swung his little bare foot into his hand.
?Numa and me,? he said. ?We didn?t fink
you?d mind.?
They reached the house. Mr. Allars flung
* O


himself from his horse and knotted his reins.
Then he saw the blinds.
? What are they dropped for ? ? he asked.
? Numa and me,? said Philip anxiously.
The little brown man jumped down and
knotted his reins. Then they all went into the
house together.
The two front rooms were bed-rooms. The
beds fronted the doors ?and they were just as
they had been slept in.
At the end of the hall was the dining-room.
Philip almost shivered when he saw the table
just as they had left it at breakfast, he and
Numa having lunched on board their vessel.
They went a little further.
The kitchen was empty, the fire out, Caesar gone.
And at that sight even the little brown man
broke into a volley of oaths.
Mr. Allars raised his voice and called Numa.
But no Numa came.
He swore in a voice of thunder, and called
upon Numa to put in an appearance or he would
smash his head, break his back, wring his neck
and do other terrible things.
Then Numa crept out from behind a wood-heap
close at hand.
Mr. Allars switched his whip over the bare
dark shoulders, and the little brown man switched
his round the bare dark legs.
And Numa danced and yelled and shrieked.
Philip, in the background, trembled and thrust
his fingers into his ears. Then he remembered
and understood.


He leapt forward, past his grandfather and the
brown man, right up close to Numa. And he
flung his arms around him and clung to him.
?It was all me !? he cried. ?It was all me !
was all me ! ?
Then the whips fell away.
His grandfather bent those eagle eyes of his.
? Why you ? ? he asked.
? ?Cause I got it up. I was the captain ?he
was only Davy Jones.?
Davy Jones slunk backwards.
? Well,? said Mr. Allars, ? I?ll lay it on to one
of you. Somebody?s back got to be broken for
this.?
?Not me!? said Numa. ?Not me, massa.
Numa was only Davy Jones.?
? Me,? whispered Philip, trembling.
? Very good,? said his grandfather, and brought
down the whip. ?Youre six and a bit, you
say. Then there?s a lash for every year, and
there?s one for the bit.? He threw down his
whip. ? Now go to bed, he said.
Philip walked away, his eyes dry, his face
white. He could hardly hold back his tears till
he reached his own room.
Numa watched him out of sight. Then he
drew a long sigh and looked at his masters.
� Massa Feelip bad ?un,? he said, and slunk
into the kitchen to prepare a meal.
? A thrashing never comes amiss to a boy,?
observed Mr. Allars. ? A little more of the
whip might have saved Richard?s and Selwyn s
souls.?


At tea lie and the little brown man had the
table to themselves.
They had damper and chops and milkless tea.
Once Numa came to the door and said ?
?No tea for Massa Feelip ?eh ? ?
? No ! ? shouted his master stormily.
And the little brown man said ? Eh, eh ! ? this
time.
But after tea, when the chairs were back on
the verandah and the two men were comfortably
smoking in them, Mr. Allars smiled through his
clouds of smoke.
For he saw the face of his little grandson and
his sturdy bare legs as he flashed past him to the
whip?s point.
? It?s a blanky nuisance havin? a child ?bout
the place,? said the little brown man, ? but ?ee?s
a well-plucked ?un. Teach him to ride.?
Numa crept along the hall and peeped at them.
So stealthy was his tread that not a creak
sounded.
Then he shot himself round and into Philip?s
room.
? Here y?are, Capten ! ? he said, and thrust his
hand under the bed-clothes.
And Philip supped off cold chop and damper.


CHAPTER IV
The next morning Philip sat on the verandah,
and eyed his vessel?s deck retrospectively.
During breakfast he had explained his own
and Numa?s naval positions to his grandfather,
and had eulogised the adaptability of the veran-
dah and the lounge chairs for his purpose.
He was fast getting over his shyness and set-
tling down into a little niche that seemed as if it
had been waiting for him all along.
This morning his grandfather came to the hall
door again, and again he cracked his whip and
called ? Numa.?
Then he looked at Philip.
? What are you doing, Philip ? ? he asked, as
he had done the morning before.
His orandson stared into his face, his beautiful
O
eyes eager.
? I was just going to ask you if you?d mind me
taking the boats out again,? he said. ?Me and
o o
Numa. Just two boats would do.?
? Surely there?s room enough for a sprat like
you on the verandah,? his grandfather said.
? It?s not a bad verandah.?
? There?s woom! ? said Philip earnestly. ? It?s
121


the most stwemendous verandah I?ve ever been
on, but it hasn?t any waves. You don?t know
how lovely it is to keep bumping up and bump-
ing down, and finking you?re going over, and all,
do you % But down there?zust look at all the
lumps ! ?
His grandfather pointed to a dilapidated-look-
ing chair. ?You may have that,? he said.
Then he choked Philip?s thanks and nodded to
Numa.
? He?s bringing you some work along,? he said.
Philip stood up and looked.
And there was Numa with four horses instead
of two.
?Oh ! ? said Philip, with a big sigh.
A shining look came into his face, and he
slipped off the verandah and ran forward.
? Come on, Capten,? said Numa, with his large
smile. ? This?m yours.?
? But he?s got no saddle on,? said Philip,
standing still.
The little brown man cackled from the door-
way.
Mr. Allars said never a word, but he watched,
frowning heavily.
? Come on, Capten,? said Numa again.
But the little captain looked round to his
grandfather.
? Aren?t I to have a saddle, grandfarver ? ? he
asked.
? No,? said his grandfather, ? you have to learn
without. Proper way. Now, hurry on with
you.?


? Come on, Numa,? said Philip, strutting for-
ward. ?Give us a shove up. Now, then, look
out I don?t knock him over. S-s-s-steady does
it!
? What does it feel like?? asked his grand-
father, smiling now.
-r n 1 -111 ? 1
? It?s the loveliest feeling I ever feeled,? said
Philip enthusiastically. ? I a?vise you to leave off
your saddle, zust to see. Am I coming wiv you ? ?
? Pm going a matter of twenty or thirty miles.?
? Oh, well,? replied the small horseman, ? I
aspect I?d better be starting. P?waps I won?t be
able to go as quick as you yet.?
? He?ll be backing them colts for us to-
morrow,? said the little brown man. Then he
leapt to his horse and rode off.
? Don?t go beyond the slip-rails to-day,? said
Mr. Allars, as he, too, went away.
A fortnight later Mr. Allars looked down the
breakfast-table to Philip, who was plying his
knife and fork with more vigour than grace.
? Hurry up, now,? he said. ? Quick at meat,
quick at work. You?re coming with me to-day.?
? Where to ? ? asked Philip, putting on extra
speed.
? Never mind.?
? Oh. Going to take guns ? ?
? No.?
? ?Cause isn?t it ?bout time I could shoot ? I?m
going on for seven, you know. I aspect you
could shoot a man by you were seven.?
Mr. Allars smiled.
?You shall learn,? he said, softening a little.


? You shall learn all that best makes a man, so
as to be able to take care of your own life and
somebody else?s, too ?when the time comes.
Now, go into the kitchen and rip up two news-
papers into the size of penny pieces, and fill your
pockets with them. Look sharp.?
One lesson Philip had learnt was to obey with-
out question.
He went at once, and returned quickly with
bulging-out pockets.
? Send Numa to take care of ?im,? said the
little brown man.
? Not I,? said Mr. Allars, ? Take care of a
boy ! Now, then, out to your horse, Philip.?
They went out together, grandfather and
grandson. To-day Philip was promoted to a
saddle, so he held his head higher.
? Now, keep your eyes open,? said Mr. Allars.
?YMu?re going a good eight miles, and you?re
coming back alone. Here and there as you go
scatter some of that paper. It?ll help you to
track your way.?
They rode for something like two miles with-
out a w T ord between them.
Then Mr. Allars pointed to a ravine.
?Blackwattle Gully,? he said. ?Don?t for-
get.?
They rode another mile, through a land of
yellow wattle-bloom. Presently they came to a
conical-shaped mound, about two feet high and
standing in the midst of a little cleared space.
? Trapper?s grave,? said Mr. Allars. ? Re-
member ! ?


Philip scattered his papers luxuriously. The
similitude of every part of the bush he passed to
every other part showed him how easily he could
be lost.
After they had gone about three mdes further
they came to a tolerably clear track.
? Coach road,? said Mr. Allars.
They were riding at a brisk canter side by side
now.
? When you said Twapper?s grave,? said Philip,
? who did you mean ? Was Twapper a man or a
dog ?"
?Trapper was a bushranger; he was shot
about thirty years ago. He?d got as many
murders on his soul as you have fingers on
your hands. I?d like to have had the killing
of him! ?
? Who had ? ? asked Philip breathlessly.
? A drivelling mounted police. Since then
we?ve had police scouring the country for twenty
years for his cave. They never found it.
?What did they want it for? What would
they have done with it ? ?
?Emptied it, my boy. It?s supposed to be
chock-a-block with nuggets and treasure. He?d
robbed fellows coming from the diggings, broken
into banks, bailed up stations. Hullo, there ! ?
His horse had stopped suddenly, quivering in
every limb. Just in front of them on the roa.d
was a large black snake, slowly coiling itself
round the terrified animal?s fore-leg.
? Sit still and hold him steady,? said Mr.
Allars, passing his reins over.


It was hard work, for the horse was beginning
to rear and plunge.
Philip set his mouth.
?All wight,? he said. ?Now, then, steady
there, you bwute, s-steady.?
His grandfather dismounted, walked stealthily,
then put out his hand and seized the snake at a
point just below the back of his head.
Then with his other hand he uncoiled him and
freed the horse. If he had loosened his clasp, if
he had fixed it one-tenth of an inch lower, his
life would probably have ended before the sun
went down.
But he knew that perfectly. For one swift
minute he held the deadly, wriggling thing, then
suddenly dashed him on the road, breaking his
back.
Then he turned to Philip and said?
? Get down and come and look at him. He?s
about the deadliest snake there is. There?s that
one point just behind his head that it?s safe to
take him by?just there. But don?t you try it.
Take a good stout stick till you?re older. Then
I?ll teach you my way.?
? Let?s have a try on this fellow,? said Philip ;
?it?s as well to begin on a dead one.?
His grandfather watched him bring down a
stick in three good whacks. He smiled a little,
for the child?s earnestness to be in all ways a
good bushman was pleasant to him.
? Best leave snakes alone, though, for a few
years,? he said. ?Don?t be first to pick a
quarrel with one.?


Then he turned towards the horses.
? Unstrap your saddle now,? he said.
Philip tried hard, but the straps were very
high. Standing on tip-toe he could only just
touch them.
? I can?t do it,? he said, ? ascept you come and
hold me up.?
His grandfather had been watching him from
his eye corners.
?Can?t!? he said, undoing his own saddle
with rapid fingers. ? Can?t! If you use that
word to me again I?ll give you a taste of the
whip you won?t enjoy.?
? All wight,? said Philip. He led his horse
along the road to a fallen tree, climbed up, and
struggled over the straps again.
At last he dragged the saddle back to his
grandfather.
? Now what ? ? he asked cheerfully, and raising
a small perspiring face upwards.
? Only put this one of mine on. You ought
to know how, after taking that off.?
? All wight,? said Philip again, ? I?m getting
used to it now. P?waps I?d better do it for you
every morning till I get my hand in.?
He found it was harder putting it on than
taking it off. But he tried to be sociable over it.
? I see you?re one of those persons who b?lieve
in changing saddles,? he said. ?Is it ?cause
you?re heavier than me and would soon wear one
out? Saddles must be ?spensive things. Bless
this stwap ! ?dash it! My horse has sudd?nly
gwown tewebly fat.?


Mr. Allars came to his assistance.
? There are two things you?ve to learn,? he
said. ? They never come amiss to a man. One
is to be game, and the other, never to say die.
Never let man or beast know if you are afraid,
and make your way through a stone wall if it?s
too high to get over.?
? ?Twould be easier to get over if there was a
man to give you a leg-up,? said Philip thought-
fully.
? Only take a leg-up from a man when you
haven?t a leg to stand on,? said his grandfather.
At which Philip laughed merrily.
? What would be the good of it then ? ? he
asked.
His Grandfather nodded. ? Remember what
O
I say,? he said, smiling grimly, ? and you?ll
understand it later. Now hop up.?
Philip took one, two, three, and a jump.
?Do you know why I changed saddles ? ?
asked his grandfather. ? ?Twas because you?ve
been sitting on X5OO all this time. I rather
expected to be bailed up in the bush there.?
? Oh ! ? said Philip.
? I thought it was safer with you, you see.
Now turn round and clear off home.?
?But,? said Philip, ?you might be bailed
up yet. Pll take it a bit furver if you?re
fwitened.?
? You?re very good,? said his grandfather,
? but I?ve a good road to the station now. If
you?ll just hurry home and protect the house and
the men it?ll do.?


Philip rode home at a sharp canter. And all
the way the paper pieces guided him like so
many beacon lights.
? He?s a clever man, my grandfarver,? he said.
? He?s a fine clever man for you.?


CHAPTER V
Philip was ten. Ten years old and tall and
strong enough to pass for fourteen.
He could swim like a young kanaka, than
which there is perhaps only a water animal
proper can do better.
He could ride like a young bushman, than
which Australians at least can show no one
better.
And he could shoot. The little brown man
used sometimes to say, in his grim, sarcastic
way, that he could wing any of the larks at
Heaven?s gate.
But he could neither read nor write, and the
last prayer he had ever uttered was whispered
with Mary at Ellen?s knee, four years ago now.
His morals and Numa?s were similar, with
only a difference in them of instinct here and
there.
Numa?s first care was for his skin, and any
v oid-perversion that would save it he employed.
He was aware of the distinction between a lie
and the truth, but he recognised both as weapons
o� self-defence, and used them as such. So the


occasion provoked either from him, according as
he could foresee results.
Philip?s instinct was romantic. He loathed a
lie that would save his skin, discerning in that a
savage?s cowardice.
But he revelled in one that would glorify glory,
or put a fine finish to a story.
Not once in all the four years had he been
beyond this little township, not once had he
been spoken to of his father, or heard his mother?s
name.
So he forgot them as we half remember
dreams, and the time that he had not been as
he now was, and not had what he now had,
seemed to him to belong to another life and an-
other boy. And he was happy without knowing
anything about it.
So closed his first decade. The second opened
to him newly.
One morning his grandfather said to him?
? Philip, I don?t know whereabouts your birth-
day is, but you must be getting somewhere near
to eleven.?
For two years Philip had been ?six and a
bit,? then he had forgotten to keep count, and
no one else had appeared to notice the flight of
time.
? Oh, I must be,? he replied, only too glad to
be given those years.
Counting from when I fetched you here,
you re ten odd. Close of this year w T ill make
you eleven. For education, you?re about two.?
? Just about,? said Philip genially.


? You don?t know your ABC yet, I believe, ?
continued his grandfather.
? I did know some of it when first I came
here,? said Philip. ? And I can tell an A fast
enough when I see one now. But you know*
how* it is yourself. I dare say if you didn t
keep it up with the paper a bit you?d soon for-
get.?
? Well, we?ll teach you to remember first.
I don?t suppose you?d forget to swum if you didn?t
sight water for ten years.?
? I might get a bit stiff in the joints, though,?
said Philip, wdio always had an answer ready.
?Well, you?re going to learn a thing or tw*o
new*. I don?t want any blockheads belonging to
me. There?s a tutor coming up for you to-day.?
? A tutor ! ? exclaimed Philip wonderingly.
? Ay,? said Mr. Allars. ? He?s a youth fresh
from college. You can go and fetch him up
from the train. Take him a horse, and have his
luggage sent on by bullock team. He?ll have to
sleep in the extra bed in your room. I didn?t
have any tutor?s places put up here.?
? How* shall 1 know* him, though ? ? asked
Philip.
? Ask me that! You?ll want me to put you
on your horse and lead you down next. Find
out.?
So Philip saddled his own horse and another,
and donned a clean suit and hat. He went into
the hall, cracking his whip and w*histling. And
there in front of the door was Numa on a frisky
little colt, teasing the two waiting horses.


? Now, who told yon to come ? ? demanded
Philip.
? Come on, Capten,? said Numa, showing his
teeth in a delighted smile.
He and Philip still played captain and sailor-
boy as enthusiastically as ever.
? I?ve a lot of business to attend to to-day,?
said Philip, putting his foot in his stirrup and
swinging himself up, ? and you?d only be in the
way.?
Suddenly he jumped down again, undid his
third saddle, and flung it aside.
? We?ll be cattle-stealers to-day,? he said.
? We?ve just grabbed these nags, and that other
fellow?s a mad bull. We?ll chase him into the
station. Come on.?
Philip leapt to his horse, they gave one wild
hip, hip, hurrah, and off they set.
Such riding ! Leaping fences, grazing trees,
springing gullies, uphill at a mad gallop, down-
hill at a madder! Now lying flat along their
horses? backs, now sitting side-saddle fashion, or,
again, standing in their stirrups.
At last they came into the little township.
In front of them was blue sky and summer-
parched paddocks. Dotted here and there, cor-
rugated iron-roofed cottages with faint blue lines
D # O
of smoke running skywards.
The ? mad bull ? was far ahead, travelling at
a tremendous speed from his tormentors. He
came to a fence something under four feet in
height, took it like a bird, and landed in private
property.


Philip, delighted, rode up to the fence. It
enclosed a brown-grassed slope, with a cottage
smiling at the top.
? You guard down here, Davy,? he said, ?and
I?ll ride round. Wild men live here, and they?d
shoot you as soon as look at you.?
Numa knew perfectly that that was some of
his Captain?s romancing, but he nodded and
said?
? Aw right, Capten ; an? if they shoot you, just
holler.?
So Philip rode round by the fence. Inside the
saddleless horse was dashing about. Suddenly
through the soft air a shrill frightened shriek
ran out. Without a moment?s halt Philip put
his horse at the low fence and shot over. Then
he found himself staring over a young loquat-
tree into an old-fashioned garden.
Down in front of him was a trembling white-
faced little girl. She was neatly pinafored,
smooth-haired, and in every respect a very
dainty little maiden.
? Did my horse touch you ? ? asked Philip,
nodding towards his horse as it fled down the
slope again.
? I b?lieve he bit me,? said the little girl,
sobbing.
Her voice made Philip wrinkle up his brow
and frown hard. He experienced the feeling
most of us have when going through a scene we
are certain we have never been through before,
and yet some remembrance tells us it is but
a recurrence.


But he laughed.
? Where did he touch you ? ? he asked.
? I don?t know.?
He laughed again, and she stopped crying to
stare at him.
? Take your howid old horse away,? she said,
? you nasty man. You?re fwitening my baby.?
How the colour ran up into Philip?s face at
being called a man ! He strained forward again
to see her ? baby.? And he saw that it was no
other than a fowl, headless and plucked ready for
cooking. It was dressed in a kitchen towel, and
the little girl was holding it tenderly by one
wing-bone, with its legs dangling to the ground.
While he was yet looking, with a dawning
smile around his lips, he heard his name called
sharply from the cottage doorway.
He saw, leaning up against the door-frame, a
slim, haggard-looking woman in a white wrapper.
She was pressing her hand to her side, as though
either breathing or standing hurt her.
?It is Philip,? she said. ?Itis ! It is ! ?
Philip said never a word. There was a feeling
of awakening remembrance in his mind that
amounted almost to pain.
? Get down and come to me. Get down and
come to me at once, Philip Allars ! ? said the
woman.
Then he slipped from his horse, knotted his
reins, and went to her.
And she put her arms round him and drew
him close, and gave him the first kisses he had
known for more than four years.


? Don?t you know me ? ? she cried. ? Don?t
you remember Auntie Ellen and little Mary ?
Oh, you great boy! Oh, you beautiful big
boy ! ?
He laughed nervously, and wriggled about
under her caresses.
She said sharply, for she had loved him very
dearly?
? Philip, don?t tell me you have forgotten us.?
He flushed up hotly.
? I?m beginning to remember,? he said ; ? truly,
I?m beginning to remember.?
She kissed him again and again. And all the
time Mary was looking at him with large eyes of
wonderment.
? Come and kiss him, Mary,? said her mother.
? Come and kiss Philip, and put your arms round
his neck and tell him how you pray for him
every morning and night ?and love him.?
And Mary came up slowly, and put her arms
round his neck, and kissed him somewhere about
the forehead he so hurriedly offered her.
?Ee?ee?ee ! Ha! ha! ha!? said Numa,
with a great laugh from behind the loquat-
tree.
? Shut up ! ? said Philip, flushing again. He
turned to Ellen?
? I?ll have to be going now,? he said.
?Oh, Philip!? she exclaimed, ?and I have
only just found you ! I have come hundreds of
miles to be near the home where your father and
Mary?s were boys together.?
?I will come again,? he said eagerly. ?I


have to go to the station to meet a tutor fellow
?but I?ll come again.?
? How long is it since you were kissed f ske
asked, smoothing his cheek.
? I don?t know,? he said, unconsciously back-
ing from her.
? There is no woman in your house she
persisted.
?No,? he said.
He sprang towards his horse, and up to his
saddle.
? I will come back,? he said, ?but I must go
to the station now. Hi, Numa! Come over and
catch that horse and bring him down to the
train to me.?
Then he flourished his hat.
? Good-bye,? he called, and passed over the
fence again.
At the station the train was already depositing
her passengers. To call it ? station ? was to give
it brevet rank. It was a platform with a small
shanty for the station-master, and a shed for a
waiting-room. All around was dense bush, with
the small cleared space dotted with cottages and
a store or two, named the township of Melton.
Philip threaded his way through a number of
men around the white gates. He looked them
all over carefully. Most of them wore leggings,
Crimean shirts and cabbage-tree hats, and most
of them were smoking and lolling about after
the style of the Australian bushman.
Not one of them tallied even remotely with
Philip?s idea of a tutor. The nearest approach


was a somewhat unhealthy-looking youth who
wore spectacles. He was very thin, and his
blue serge suit hung loosely on him. His sailor
hat was joined to his mouth by means of a string.
He was standing quite still, near the station-
master?s shanty, with two tan portmanteaux at
his feet, a fan in one hand, and a lady?s sunshade
in the other.
But Philip, who knew no ladies, did not
recognise their belongings.
He strode up to the youth, and asked him,
fiddling with his whip?
? I say ?are you a tutor ? ?
The young man looked up and nodded.
? Er?yes?l am?that is ? he stumbled.
? My name is Allars,? said Philip.
? And mine?s Pawson,? said the youth, who
was staring away over Philip?s head. ? I?say
?do you mind waiting?follow you in a minute.
Here I am, madam ! ?
Philip wheeled round and saw a lady coming
past them, from the end of the train where the
second-class carriages were. He lost her face
and her reply, because a great hulking country-
man stepped in between him and her. But the
next second he beheld his tutor walking by her
side down the platform, and lugging the two
portmanteaux.
Outside on the road two gentlemen came
forward and took a bag each. Then the tutor
shook the lady?s hand, and came back to Philip.
His eyes were glistening, and his face was
Hushed.


Philip introduced him to his horse, and
watched his hesitation wonderingly.
? I ?er ?ah?is he at all vicious ? ? he asked,
?No ! ? said Philip half angrily, for he loved
his horse, and had the same feelings a mother
might have had if asked a similar question about
her firstborn.


CHAPTER VI
The next day Rawson came home with two
rosebuds in his button-hole, and a shining face.
It was close on sundown, and he had been
away ever since he had shut up the alphabet at
mid-day.
The scene at the cottage filled him with
wonderment.
Numa was on the roof with two buckets and
a coil of ropes, Philip just below fastening a third
bucket, and that half full of water, to a rope
lowered from a chimney. He had no idea that
the roof represented the deck of the boys? new
vessel.
? What are you doing?? he asked, stopping
beside Philip.
? Fastening this fellow on,? said Philip. ?Me
and Numa have got to clean that down,? nodding
upwards.
? Numa and I,? said the tutor. ? But?good
gracious, you don?t tell me you wash your roof!?
? Always on Tuesdays and Fridays,? replied
Philip, ? Now?pull away, Davy ! ?
Davy pulled vigorously, and the bucket
mounted roof wards.


? I would like to have a word or two with you,
Philip/? said Rawson.
? All right/? said Philip, ?I?m listening.?
? No ; come inside,? said his tutor impatiently ,
?it?s ?it?s private.?
? Must do this now,? said Philip. ?No end
of a row there?d be if my grandfather came home
and found it only half done.?
Rawson seemed feverishly impatient.
? If I come up and give you a hand,? he said,
? will you do something for me afterwards ? ?
? What ?? asked Philip.
? I told you it?s private, didn?t I? ? said
Rawson testily.
?Well,? said Philip, ?come along now.
They?ll be home before we know where we
are.?
Three minutes later they were all on the roof
together, Rawson propping himself up near a
chimney, Numa and Philip flying about every-
where.
? Good roof this,? said Rawson ; ? very fine
roof indeed. Make a grand place for a smoke.?
But he couldn?t help distrusting its slipperi-
ness.
? But you don?t smoke,? said Philip.
? No ; only your grandfather and Mr. Wharton
do.?
? Now, look ?live, Captain,? shouted Numa.
? Look here,? said Philip to Rawson, ? will
you take a bucket and chuck, or shall I chuck and
you brush % You must try and make all the
water go down the spouting.?


Rawson chose the task of ? chucking.?
They worked with vigour; Numa and Philip,
barefooted, were brushing away and singing over
their work. Rawson, leaning against a chimney
was ? chucking ? thoughtfully.
After awhile Philip sent a searching eye to
the horizon.
?No more ships about, Davy,? he said, and
then stopped suddenly.
He gave a peculiar little whistle, picked up a
bucket and a broom.
? Bring your bucket and slither, tutor,? he
whispered.
And Numa added, ? Look ?live, tutor ! ?
Then four legs wriggled and disappeared, two
heads nodded and sank below the spouting and
Rawson was left alone and bewildered.
He looked below and saw Numa?s black leo-g
flashing down the path towards the slip-rails and
just beyond them Mr. Allars and the little brown
man riding home.
Slither?quick ! ? called Philip. ? Do?s we
did.?
The horsemen were coming up the path now,
and Numa was replacing the rails. Then did a
feeling of dismay enter into Rawson?s heart, and
he sat down upon the zinc and ? slithered.?
Good Lord I ? exclaimed Mr. Allars in amaze-
ment at the sight of his grandson?s tutor hangino-
on to the spouting and kicking his leo-s out
wildly into the air.
Philip came out of the door, and looked into
his grandfathers face with innocent eyes. Then


tie walked to his tutor, laid a hand on one
kicking foot, and guided it to a post.
? S-steady does it,? he said. ? Keep more to
your right; slip this leg round so, and slither.
It?s quite easy.?
His grandfather smiled, and lingered to watch.
? Such absurd?rot! ? muttered Rawson, not
being able to make up his mind to the slither.
But somebody pulled at one leg, and he
wriggled ; somebody pulled at the other, and he
wriggled again, left the spouting, and slid
down.
? I understood you had left school,? said Mr.
Allars, when they stood facing each other on the
verandah.
Rawson tried to look haughty and dignified.
? Four years ago,? he said.
Mr. Allars laughed.
? Please not to use my spouting for a horizon-
tal bar again,? he said, and turned aside.
? I was assisting Philip to clean the roof,? said
Rawson.
? Yes; he was giving me a hand with the
roof,? said Philip.
But for some reason Mr. Allars refused to be
annoyed at that or any other of Philip?s deeds
to-night. Instead, he laughed and made merry
over Rawson?s attempts at ? slithering ? and
sliding.
Just before tea Philip drew Rawson into his
bedroom.
? There?s just time to hear your secret before
tea,? he said.


Nervousness attacked Rawson. He walked
over to the dressing-table and began scribbling
upon a cardboard box-lid.
? Do you ?have you ?that is, I was wondering
do you ever go out after tea ? ? he asked.
Philip stared.
? What?s in the wind ? ? he said.
His tutor edged about.
? How?d it be for us ?you and I?to go into
the township after tea ? ? he said.
Philip?s eyes brightened.
? What do you say to the theatre ? ? asked
Rawson. ? Have you ever been ? ?
? Plenty of times,? said Philip ; ? only it?s
always been empty.?
? We might go to-night,? said Rawson ; ?only
don?t say anything to the nigger. There?s a new
company up from Melbourne. Pm sure you?d
like it awfully.?
He made a few scientific strokes with his
pencil, and stopped, with his head on one side.
Philip strained forward. What he saw was a
woman?s face, softly outlined, with tender touches
about the eyes.
There was something magical to him in its
quick and apparently careless production.
? Why, it?s a woman ! ? he exclaimed.
His tutor flushed and fidgeted.
?Do you think,? he said, ?do you think ?
how does it strike you ? ?
Philip looked at it gravely.
? Oh, it?s a woman right enough,? he said
at last.


? I know that,? said his tutor. ? It?s meant
for one. But how do you like her face ? ?
?I like it,? said Philip. ?She looks as though
she?s going to laugh. Do you know her ? ?
? Y r es ; I?l know her,? said Rawson.
? Have you ever lived in a house with a
woman ? ?
? Great goodness ! haven?t you ? ?
?No. I don?t believe in them. They?re the
very deuce, Bill the stockman says, and he?s
known a good few of them in his time. He
says as soon as ever a woman comes round,
then comes trouble. Oh, I could tell you a
thing or two about women.?
But Rawson only sighed, and regarded the
picture he had made thoughtfully.
An hour later, when he and Philip were riding
side by side through the bush, having had
much ado to evade the watchful Numa, he said
hesitatingly?
? I am asking you to accompany me to-night,
Philip, to?to oblige a lady?er ?
? Eh ? ? asked Philip in amazement.
?There is a lady?that is to say ?I have a
lady friend, and she has laid her commands
upon me to take you to her to-night. One
?one always obeys?a lady?when she com-
mands ! ?
?No fear,? exclaimed Philip, ?women have
to obey men. What is her name ? ?
? Miss Dupuy ; Miss Antoinette Dupuy ! ?
?I don?t know her,? said Philip, whistling.
?Never heard of her.?


?Be polite to her, Philip. Take off your hat
to her.?
? I can?t stand women,? said Philip. ?If she
wants me I suppose it means my troubles are
beginning.?
? She is the grandest woman on earth,? said
Rawson into the night beyond his horse?s head,
? the sweetest lady ! She ordered me to take
you to her ?I don?t know why. I know nothing.?
?Why didn?t you ask % ? said Philip.
? If she had ordered me to take your grand-
father it would have been the same ! I should
have done it! ?
? Would you, though ! ? exclaimed Philip. ? I
believe you! ?
They came to the township at last. Philip
fastened the horses to the fence that ran around
the same weatherboard, ? Theatre Royal,?
Then he and Rawson went to the front door.
The lights were going out, and a crowd of people
standing round the door and gates.
Rawson dashed forward to a tall man in a
smoking-cap, who was just coming out.
? What is the matter ? ? he demanded.
? Ah?Rawson ! ? said the man, ? I regret
that the performance is postponed. Miss Dupuy
is severely indisposed.? He lowered his voice
suddenly and whispered, ? Hysterics.?
? God bless my soul! ? exclaimed Rawson.
?I?m sorry for this ! I?m awfully sorry for this ! ?
? Performance takes place to-morrow as ad-
vertised,? continued the man, raising his voice
again.


Rawson went back to Philip and grasped his
shoulder.
?She?s ill!? he said blankly. ?111! God!
No one to watch by her, to wait on her ! God !
This is awful! ?
? Well, you?re a nice one, then,? said the boy.
? Why don?t you go and do it ? ?
?I?? exclaimed Rawson. ?I? I hadn?t
thought of it. What a fool I am! Come
along.?
He moved away and plunged across the road,
and Philip loosened the horses and followed with
them.
Just outside the Royal Hotel Rawson was
waiting for him. He secured the horses again
and went towards him.
Then Rawson drew him inside a side door,
scribbled something on a card and gave it to a
chambermaid.
He paced about feverishly as they waited.
Once he stopped and looked at Philip.
?If she should die!? he said. ?Those sort
of women always die ! ?
?Do they???said Philip.
He leaned up against the wall and surveyed
his agitated tutor with large eyes of wonder.
Presently the servant came down again. She
handed the card to Rawson.
He stooped and read aloud?
Send up Philip Allars to me. Alone.? ?
? Ah ! ? exclaimed Rawson.
Philip flushed,
? I don?t half like it,? he said.


?Take off your hat when you go in, and speak
softly,? said his tutor, going upstairs and draw-
ing Philip with him.
The servant was pausing before a door at the
head of the stairs.
? I tell you I don?t half like the look of it,
said Philip again.
? And ask her if I couldn t be of the least
service to her. Anything she wants, I will do,?
whispered Rawson.
Then the maid turned the handle and threw
open the door.
And Philip stepped in and heard it closed
behind him.
The room was a soberly-furnished sitting-room.
Three lamps shed a softened light, and from an
open balcony window a fresh, cool breeze came
in. , ,
It moved the curtains a little, and he watched
them wafting in and out, watched and saw a
white-ringed hand part them and a woman come
towards him from somewhere behind them.
Her eyes were like midnight with a glow in
it, her face was w T hite as death.
? Philip ! ? she cried passionately. ? Philip !
Oh, boy ?boy, dearest.?
She ran over to him with a sob in her throat,
she caught him in her arms and held him
close, and put him away, and held him close
again.
?For God?s sake,? she whispered, ? don t tell
me that you have forgotten me ! That I?your
mother ?am gone out of your heart I


The boy?s face went white.
?My mother ! ? he said. He could feel her
tears upon his cheek.
? Y r es, yes, beloved! Your own ?your mother!
Consider it all, Philip. Have you forgotten
your own father and mother in a few little
?7>
? My father,? whispered the child, trembling,
as the flood-gates of memory rolled back. ?He
used to play with us ?we went in a boat?l can
remember his face ! ?
She sobbed, clasping him closer.
? Alas ! ? she said. ? And I cannot forget it.
I see his eyes always I His miserable, haunting
eyes. And I know that he is wandering about
the world alone?with his heart aching for us
two
A harsh laugh from the door interrupted.
? Telling him that ancient story ! And weep-
ing over it still ! ?
It was a man?s voice.
Philip sprang round. He found himself facing
a dark, sharp-featured man, a little girl with
matted golden hair and swollen blue eyes, and
a small, tired-looking woman.
? I am amazed,? said the man, ? that a woman
of your age should turn on the water-works for
nothino- ?
O
My age! ? cried Felise. ?It proves my
youth to weep easily,?
?Mho?s the youngster?? asked the rhan,
nodding to Philip.


? Mine/' said Felise proudly. ? You ?who
knew his father?say, is he not like ? ?
? He will make a finer man than his father
ever was,? said the woman.
? There could not be a finer man than Richard,
could there, Philip, beloved ? ? whispered Felise.
The man laughed.
?He is like a young Romeo,? he said. ? Will
that satisfy you ? Now permit me ?Mr. Philip
Allars ?my daughter, Miss Nellie Bright.?
He drew his little girl forward and the children
stared at each other. The little girl saw a thin
stripling of a boy with a handsome, sun-tanned
face, and large dark eyes. The boy saw a thin,
sharp-faced girl with untidy golden hair and eyes
that scowled and threatened a storm.
He turned aside.
The man laughed.
? None too polite to each other now,? he said,
? and perhaps one of these days they?ll be want-
ing to marry each other. Eh, Philip % ?
? I wouldn?t want to marry her,? said Philip
shortly.
Again the man laughed.
? She might want to marry you,? he said.
Later, Felise kissed her boy in the corridor,
and looked long in his face, as though she were
trying to read the coming years there.
? Never think hardly of me, boy,? she whis-
pered.
Philip clung to her.
? Let me stay with you. Let me stay !? he


begged. For a childish longing to be with his
mother was in his heart, with a manly one to
protect her.
She kissed him lingeringly.
? Come to me here at eleven on Wednesday/
she said. ? And love me, when you come and
when you go ! ?


CHAPTER VII
It was morning, very early, and Philip was
asleep.
Rawson lay watching him from his bed with
miserable spectacled eyes. He could only see
the outline of a form, but it was sufficient for
him.
He kept saying?
? Her son. Her hoy. His mother! Her
husband! ? over and over again, in a dull, a
pleading, or a passionate way. Then he would
cover his face with his hands and groan. Then
he would turn to the wall and stare at it, and say
the words all over again. It seemed to him that
he held the world in his hands, and that it was
crumbling away into sand.
Suddenly he sat upright, stared out of the
window, and began to laugh.
? That baby to have a boy of that size! ? he said.
? Why, Pm a stark raving lunatic ! Antoinette!
Antoinette ! Antoinette ! ?
Even to his boots and rose-buds he was as he
had ridden home the night before.
? Why ? ? he demanded of the daylight?
? why did I come back here ? AVhy should I toil
152


to keep a life she can never make ? I will end
it all!? He sprang from the bed. ? I will
die ! ?
He smiled sadly at his reflection in the glass.
?To suicide at twenty-one ! ? he said. ? It?s
young ! ?
He poured out some water and began to wash.
It was pure, cold, and refreshing.
He smiled less sadly at his reflection as he
combed his hair.
Then a thought sprang at him, and struck him
so that he dropped the brush and stared, almost
dazed at the magnificence of it.
? Dolt! ?he said, ? fool! Blind idiot that I
am ! If that fails, I can but die. I can but die,
then ! ?
He gathered together his scattered garments
o o o
and stuffed them into his bag. He was almost
trembling as he did it.
O ? .
? Before to-night,? he murmured, ? I shall
know whether lam to live or die. I can act, at
any rate. Who knows but what I may be Romeo
to her Juliet ? ?
He left the room quietly by way of the window.
Philip awoke with the sunshine blazing into
his eyes.
For a space, devoted to yawning and the
stretching of his limbs, he felt just his ordinary
everyday self.
Then he saw his tutors empty bed, and he
remembered with a swift indrawing of his breath
that he had a mother. That he had a father.
That he had made up his mind last night to steal


away from this grandfather who had been a
father to him, and to cling to a mother he had
almost forgotten.
He sprang out of bed and began to dress
quietly. Numa thrust his head in the window.
� ? Now, then, pecaunine, look ?live ! ? he said,
but Philip had no reply for him.
? Wha?s up ? ? asked Numa.
Philip ducked his face in the basin of Crater
and ignored him.
Then Numa leapt into the room.
? Wha?s tutor ?? he asked. cc Ee?ee?ee ! ?
? I don?t know,? said Philip, drying his face
rapidly.
Numa went up close to him, laid a finger
alongside his nose, shut one eye, and ran all his
mouth over to one side of his face.
Whas tutor ? ? he said again.
At that Philip looked sharply round the room
at the bed, that, though crumpled, had not been
slept in, at the corner in which the bulging-out
bag had stood.
? Where is he \ ? he asked.
But Numa only twisted up his face again and
said?
? Wha? d?ye get to yesternight ? ?
�� Never mind,? said Philip.
�< Naver mind,? said Numa.
Philip shot himself out of the room to his
grandfather, who was just walking up to his seat
at the breakfast-table.
? I?ve got a surprise for you,? said the boy.
�� I?m?Pm surprised myself. Tutor?s cleared! ?


His grandfather removed the dish-cover and
said ?
? Chops ! ? Then he sat down and looked at
Philip.
? Mr. Eawson left before sunrise,? he said.
? Why ? Isn?t he coming back any more ? ?
asked the child in amazement.
? I fancy not,? said his grandfather. ? I saw
him cutting across the far paddock lugging his
bag. ?Twns a low sort of thing to do, though, to
steal away from a man?s house without a word.
Chop, my lad ? ?
? Please,? said Philip thoughtfully.
That speech of his grandfather?s rather altered
the aspect of things to him.
? Why was it low ? ? he asked,
? Sneaky ! ? said his grandfather. ? Smug-
gling himself out of a window like a thief, and
scudding across the paddock like a rabbit with a
dog behind it! ?
A long silence dropped in between them. The
little brown man came in and sat down opposite
Mr. Allars. He drew the basin of brown sugar
over to him, made his porridge into a horrid,
unpalatable-looking mess, and began to eat in a
determined, business-like way.
Presently Mr. Allars said, with a quick look at
his grandson ?
? Did you put the slip-rails up when you came
in last night, Philip ? ?
And Philip started, and dropped his knife and
fork with a clatter. And Numa, who was just


coming in with a dish of steaming potatoes, said:
? Ee?ee?ee ! ? with a delighted chuckle.
? I?l?l ? began Philip. ? The?the? ?
<� ?Look here, my lad,? said his grandfather.
? A plain � yes ? or � no ? is good enough for me.
None of your stumbling, stammering I?l p s .
That sort of thing is one of the by-paths into a
lie. Now, when does your mother want you to
see her again ? ?
All the colour fled from the boys face,
�� To-morrow,? he answered, his eyes looking
straight into his grandfather?s face.
The little brown man stopped eating, his
spoon half-way between his mouth and pl?ate.
�� Ts mother ! ? he said.
�� What time to-morrow ? ? asked Mr. Allars.
�� Eleven,? said Philip.
His grandfather sat back suddenly in his chair.
A little smile came to his lips and eyes.
? Tbe penalty was too great for her,? he said.
bhe wants im ? asked the little brown man.
� She did, and I told her she might have him.
She pi eferred him staying with me as
But I won?t have him unsettled. Fortunately,
she has been politic. The?the contingent leaves
by mail to-night,? he said ambiguously. �� Do
you follow me ? ?
Philip was at sea, but the little brown man
nodded and smiled.
A sort ot put-ofl job wuth him,? he said.
Breakfast proceeded a little further ; then Mr.
Allars asked abruptly?


? About that other youngster ?what are you
going to do ? ?
?I?ve told you,? said the little brown man
doggedly. ? Nothin
? The child can?t be turned on the world, ?
said Mr. Allars. ? And a girl !?Be damned to
your son and mine ?but we can t let their children
eat charity bread.?
? We can if we?ve a mind ter.?
? Icon?ll have to do something for the girl.?
?Not I; she?s got a mother. Eh ? ? He
shuffled up from his seat.
? Dying,? said Mr. Allars. ? Dying, Tom.?
?Let ?er die, then. Wish she?d never lived,?
said the little brown man, going out of the room
and whistling all the way to the front door.
? Who?s dying ? ? asked Philip. But his
grandfather only put down his knife and folk
and stared at the centre cruets, and muttered
about the cares of children and children?s chil-
dren. Then he, too, went away.
Philip began his morning occupation of col-
lecting bones for the dogs in a somewhat
depressed mood.
Numa stood in the doorway and watched his
grave face solicitously.
At last he could bear the silence no longer,
and asked, ? Wha?s up, Capten?? anxiously.
Philip did not reply.
?Wha?s up?? he went on. ?Tutor chap?s
cleared. You and me left togeder agen.
Hurra I ?
But Philip was still silent.


? Ship?s ready. Buckets ?m up,? said Numa.
But Philip did not speak.
? Bushrangers ! ? urged Numa, and waited.
?Cattle-stealers!? and waited again.
Philip?s eyes brightened.
? I know,? he said. ?Come on. I kept
thinking of it yesterday. We?re bushrangers ;
you and me.?
? Um,? said Numa breathlessly.
?And you know the Cave of the Wild
Women?? (which meant Ellen?s and Mary?s
home).
? Um,? said Numa again.
? Well, we?ve to go and snavel Mary, without
her mother knowing or anything. We?ll go and
bring her over here ; and we?ll take her back
again after, of course. Come on,?
Um, come on. Hurra ! ? Numa somer-
saulted to the door. His delight entered into
his legs and sent him bounding out to the
horses. Philip ran after, and they caught the
horses, slipped on their reins, and leapt to their
saddleless backs.
Then began a goodly time, in wdiich they each
strove to outride the other and outshout the
other; in which they bounded through the
glorious fresh air, supremely happy, without ever
knowing anything about it.
they came within sight of Ellen?s
cottage they slackened speed.
' morrow at eleven I have to meet ?a
lady, said Philip, speaking his last thought
aloud.


? Wild woman ? ? asked Numa,
? No,? said Philip indignantly. ? A lady. My
mother.?
??Me, too,? said Numa.
But Philip took no notice of him.
? Got a bag ? ? asked Numa.
?Bag ?? asked Philip. ?Oh ! for Mary. They
don?t use bags for women. Bill says when
Trapper took Fricksy Kate he and his mate just
clapped something over her mouth, muffled up
her head, and rode like mad with her to his
cave.?
? An? she hollered, you know,? said Numa,
his eyes dancing and sparkling at the goodliness
of this thing.
?Oh ! she hollered,? said Philip. ? And so
will Mary, I expect. Now this is how it?s to be.
Igoup to her and talk. And I get her to come
into the far paddock. Then I shoot my coat
over her head. Up you come. We sling her on
to a horse, and the thing?s done.?
Outside the paddock adjoining Ellen?s cottage
they both alighted, and Numa fastened the
horses to the fence and climbed up a tree to
watch and wait.
Philip went forward alone. His hands were
in his pockets; his eyes grave and thoughtful.
It was the first time in all his varied career he
had tried to steal a wife.
In the garden Mary was turned loose among
the flowers. He stopped for a second to wonder
at her movements.
Both of her hands were outspread, and she


was buzzing up and down the paths and among
the bushes as rapidly and busily as the busiest of
exemplary bees. When she reached the mar-
guerite bush she ran into it and bent her face
down to the flowers.
?Hi! You, there. Wild woman!? said
Philip, with the greeting he had given her
yesterday.
? I?m not a wild woman,? said Mary indig-
nantly. ? I?m a butterfly.?
He looked at her gravely, considering how
heavy she was.
? Are you anything to-day ? ? she asked
anxiously.
? Why, I?l?m Philip ! ? he said patronisingly.
And she sighed, thankful he was no worse.
? Come for a walk in the paddock ? ? he asked.
? I?m vewy busy,? she said, ? because I have
only just done being a gwub. But I don?t mind
for a bit.?
But Philip just stood staring at her. He did
not appear to have heard a word.
? Come on,? she said, and set off in front of
him.
? Stop a minute,? he said suddenly ; ? le?s just
have a see if ?whether you?re heavy. There s
no knowing the weight of women till you feel
y 7?
em.
She held up her arms, and he raised her.
? There?s plenty of you,? he said, putting her
down quickly.
Half-way through the paddock she stopped,
startled, for he was dragging off his coat.


? Now, what?s that for ? ? she asked sus-
piciously.
? Oh,? he said, with an assumption of careless-
ness, ? I?m very fond of my shirt-sleeves. Come
along, now, little Miss Tricksy. Don?t you think
Tricksy?s a stunning name ? ?
? What does it mean ? ? asked Mary, suspicious
still.
? Oh, it means a bushranger?s wife, you know;
a woman who was kept in a cave, an? had one eye
knocked in, an? was bruised an? banged about.?
Mary stood still.
? Le?s be going back,? she said.
But he took no notice.
? An? through it all,? he continued, ? she stuck
to him. He could have had any one else, but he
wanted Tricksy. And so he came and snavelled
her, and ?
He was gazing at her fiercely.
?Oh, do le?s be going back,? cried Mary,
edging away from him.
Suddenly he raised his arms and his coat, and
whistled.
He folded the coat tightly over the suu-bon-
netted head and little frightened face, and Mary
struggled and kicked valiantly.
But Philip was very strong.
Now then ; s-s-steady does it! Up with her
feet whde I grab her head 1 Up?er?steady
there. Davy ! ?
_____ * J
His voice sounded far away, and terrible to
her in her darkness.
She parted with half of her pinafore at the


fence, and she felt herself dragged and pushed
and pulled up to a great height.
Then she knew, with a spasm of sickly terror,
that she was on a living moving horse, with
some one?s arm tightly round her.
? Smash her ?ead with the gun, if she hollers !?
said Numa?s voice savagely.
So she shut up her mouth very closely, and sat
as silent as death.
They sped on, in a dizzy reckless way, for ten
long minutes. Then they drew rein, and Philip
unwound the coat and let the sweet fresh air
touch the little white face.
For a space the daylight was too much for
her, and she had to shut her eyes and bury
her face against Philip?s flannel shirt.
? Now, sit steady while I get into my coat,?
he said. ? D?ye hear me, Tricksy ? ?
? Yes, Philip,? she said hurriedly.
He thrust his arms in, then looked at her
again.
?Do you know where you are going ? ? he
asked.
? No,? she said whisperingly.
? Well, you?re going to be my wife in my cave.
How d?ye like that ? ?
? Not very much,? she said.
He smiled, well pleased.
? That?s right,? he said. ? You?ve not got to
like it, till I?ve knocked you about a bit. If you
like, you can holler.?
Her lip quivered.
? Then Numa comes up,? he continued, ? and


bangs you behind; and I swear at you, and
knock you with my gun. Here, Davy; come
and hold her while I get in front of her. Now,
put your arms round me, and hang on to your
eyebrows.?
She hardly knew how to accomplish that last,
but she held on to him with all her might and
main, sitting astride behind him.
And then away they flew, through the sweet
fair bush, over the rough uneven ground and
amongst the trees.
Presently N uma drew rein, waving his arms.
Philip stopped.
? What?s the row ? ? he asked.
? My turn now,? said Numa.
? No fear,? said Philip.
? \es. Come on, you there ! ?
But Mary clung to Philip.
*? I want w if e > too,? said Numa, his face cloud-
ing over. ? You not keep er all a time.?
?Hands off!? shouted Philip. ?Go and
steal your own wife! Whose wife are vou
Tricksy??
Youis, please, Philip, said Tricksy eagerly
? Y r ou hear that! ? said Philip. ? Now �et ud
there ! ? This last to his horse � P ?
Numa turned, and rode in a different direction
? You , not P la 7 fair,? he said, ? You said
turns and turns about. You cheat! ?
? He?ll come back soon enough,? said Philip
to Mary. ? I think I see myself handing you
over Look here, you can begin to be a bit
tnendly with me now, if you like.?


But Mary was at a loss how to set about it.
Two hours later Numa went home alone. He
slipped from his horse in the far paddock, and
walked slowly up the hill among the pumpkins.
At the fence a great fear entered into his
heart, for he saw his master?s horse fastened up
to a verandah post. He leaped over and slunk
silently to the kitchen, only to come face to face
with his master in the doorway.
His first greeting was a whip-slash across the
legs, and he began to yell immediately.
? Where Massa Philip ? ? demanded Mr. Allars,
with his wdiip raised for a second blow.
? Him not come ?ome yet,? blubbered Numa.
? I not know wha? ?im got to.?
? Have you been near Mrs, Wharton?s to-day ?
The truth now, or I?ll half skin you.?
Numa shivered. He could almost feel his
skin being torn from him.
?Me not,? he said ; ? ?twas all the Capten. ?Ee
not let ?er be my wife at all; so I come ?ome an
do my work. It not me, anyhow.
? What the devil are you talking of? ? roared
Mr. Allars.
Numa backed into the wood-shed.
?Capten ?ee gammon, ?ee bushranger,? he
whimpered. ? ?Ee snavel Mrs. Wharton?s girl
for his wife. ?Ee no let me have ?er ; an? I come
?ome. c Steal your own wife,? ?ee says ; an? I
come ?ome.?
Mr. Allars turned away suddenly; but Numa
stood still among the wood. Presently he peeped
round the corner, and saw his master unfastening


his horse and preparing to mount again. He
came out.
? You go in and clean little bedroom off the
pantry,? said Mr. Allars. ? Scrub him out, and
make up bed with Massa Wharton?s things. ?
Then he rode away.


CHAPTER VIII
The little brown man rode home at sunset
alone. He did not whistle for Numa, because
both of the slip-rails were out of place and
reared up against the fence.
He rode round to the back of the house,
swung himself down, slipped his reins over a
nail on the wood-house wall, and went in through
the kitchen door.
Just inside, on the passage floor, was his old
smoking-coat. He picked it up and stared at it,
turning it round.
? Who?s been meddlin? with my coat ? ? he
said.
But there was no one to answer him.
He went on. The dining-room table lay
spread ready for dinner. In the doorway his
own particular chair lay on its back with its legs
sticking out towards him. He raised it and set
it in its place.
? Who?s been meddlin? with my chair ? ? he
asked. But no one was there to reply.
He lifted a dish-cover, stared at a steaming
leg of mutton, put it down again, and walked
166


down the room rubbing his hands together.
And there, at the end of the table, lay his own
particular hammer.
?Who?s been meddlin? with my ?ammer?? he
demanded, snatching it up.
Then he threw it down again angrily.
?I?ll soon find out who ?tis,? he said. Just
like the little brown bear of nursery renown.
He went along the hall and turned in at his
bed-room door. His bed was ready made, but
rumpled about and dented in the middle.
? Who?s been lying on my bed 1 ? he shouted.
Just like the little brown bear again.
Then he stood still, too amazed to find a word
to say. For there, just behind his door, at his
washstand, in his room, dabbling away with his
soap and water, was a little brown-haired, brown-
eyed girl.
He stared at her with a look as fierce as a
compression of the three bears in one.
? It?s you,? he said.
And for answer she trembled, dropped soap
and towel, and ran away through the open
French window.
At that he drew in a great breath and turned
back into the hall.
And there met him there Mr. Allars, Philip,
and the little brown-eyed girl again.
?Who?s she 1 ?? he demanded, pointing wrath-
fully at the small stranger.
?Your son?s child,? replied Mr. Allars.
? Then out she goes,? shouted the little brown
man.


? Not so fast,? said Mr. Allars quietly. ? This
is my house, remember. I say she stays.?
? I want to go home, please,? whispered Mary.
?You?re there,? said Mr. Allars. ?In the
only home you?ve got. Take her to the table,
Philip.?
Philip drew her away.
? Who fetched her ? ? asked the brown man.
?Philip stole her this morning,? replied Mr.
Allars, ?and brought her here. I had gone
away to fetch her, for her mother died this
morning.?
He said it in an indifferent, matter-of-fact
way.
The little brown man started. ? Selwyn?s
wife I ? he said.
? Ay,? said Mr. Allars, ? and she?s been dying
ever since he left her, it appears. Now she?s
dead. This youngster can knock about here for
a bit, until you send her to school.?
?Does she know ? ? asked the little brown man
in a whisper.
?About her mother? Not yet. We?ll tell
her in a day or two. Let her settle down first.?
They went in to dinner together. The two
children w T ere facing each other over the roughly-
set table. The two grandfathers sat down
opposite each other, and every one but Mary
began to eat.
?Why don?t you have some tea?? asked
Philip, wondering at her abstinence.
? I don?t want any,? said Mary with a catch
in her voice.


Mr. Allars looked at her with the stern look
that had subdued Philip more than four years
ago.
? Get your tea,? he said.
? I don?t ? she began, and her lip dropped.
? Get your tea,? he said again.
She began to eat so swiftly as to almost choke
herself.
?Where?s Numa?? asked the little brown
man.
? Gone to fetch your grand - daughter?s
things.?
? Eh ? ?
Philip put down his cup.
? Has he sot a grand-daughter ? ? he asked.
o o O
Mr. Allars pointed to Mary.
? There she is,? he said.
But the little brown man was not proud of the
relationship.
? Let ?er go back to them as wants ?er,? he
said. ? I don?t.?
A few minutes later Mr. Allars looked up
again.
o
? I?ve given her your room,? he said. ? You
can have the pantry bed-room. It was too much
of an outhouse for a child like that.?
And the little brown man swore in many and
various words.
Poor motherless Mary was terrified. She
recognised, with a child?s swift instinct, that to
the little scowling man she was repugnant, and
she kept as far away from him as possible.
As soon as tea was over she besought Philip


with tears in her eyes and voice to take her home.
But he shook his head and denied her, for he
knew that she was orphaned, and that his home
was now her only one.
Numa returned with a small box of clothing
for her, and she coiled herself on it, feeling-
' o
nearer home, in some indefinable way, there
than anywhere else.
Later in the evening Mr. Allars found her
there, her face disfigured and swollen with
weeping, her eyes fast shut.
He watched her in perplexity. It had been a
problem to him how he was to bring up his
grandson. But a girl-child! A little creature
who would some day grow into a woman !
? She shall go away soon,? he said half aloud.
? But I couldn?t have left her in that house of
death, and her mother begging so hard of me to
take her.?
The child stirred and moved restlessly. Her
head was almost hanging over the side of the
box.
Mr. Allars stooped and lifted her into his
arms. Then he turned towards her bed-room.
He had to smooth out the bed for her himself.
Before he could put her down she nestled
closer to him and clung with both arms round
his neck. The action held him breathless almost.
Then he saw that her eyes were fast shut and
that she was sleeping still.
He laid her down gently and pulled off her
boots and unfastened her frock and pinafore.
Then he covered the blankets over her and went


away into the hall, where the lamp stood that
lighted her room. He turned it low and went
away softly.
? Plenty of room here for a morsel like that,?
he said. ? And it?s better than an asylum or
refuge, after all.?
Quite early in the morning he heard Philip and
Numa talking to her on the verandah.
?While you?re here,? said Philip, ?you can
try to get over being a girl. It was all very well
going on like that before you knew me. But if
you don?t look out you?ll just go and grow into
a beastly woman.?
? A beastly woman,? said Numa.
?If you like to come out into the paddock
after breakfast,? continued Philip, ? you can have
a try at being a bushranger.?
? I don?t want to be a bushranger,? said Mary.
? ?Fraid 1 ? asked Numa.
? No,? she said. ? It?s only I?m not used to
being a bushranger. Generally I?m a butterfly?
or a bird?or a mother with some children,?
? Well,? said Philip, ? we?ll see what you?re
made of. We?ll start fair and forget you?re a
girl.?
? Yes, we?ll start fair,? said Numa.


PAKT 111
CHAPTER I
So the cottage had another inmate. At first it
seemed so strange as to be unreal, and so unreal
as to be part of a fairy legend.
There was one evening when the sun was
going down in a glory all blood-red, when all the
beauty of the earth seemed to have run into a
billow } western cloud, that Mr. Allars sat upon
his verandah and let his eyes gaze into the bosom
of that sun-touched cloud as though he would
have read the heart of things beneath. He sat
for a very long time, and his heart saddened and
the lines on his face deepened. For in the heart
of things he had found a heart that had been his
own, and on the bosom of the cloud, a bosom
upon which his own and one small dark head
had often rested.
_ sat very still with only the muscles of
his face moving. Then from somewhere behind
him there came a little figure in a ridiculously
short and shabby frock, and it slipped up close
and leaned upon his chair. But his eyes were
172


still far away in a beautiful young world, and he
sighed.
Then the little figure drew closer, and two
warm, clinging arms went round his neck.
? I?m so lonely,? whispered a childish voice,
and there was a choke in it.
? Ay, ay !? he said. ?We all are.?
? Won?t you take me back again, please?to
where I came from ? ?
? There are people in that house you have
never seen, and who have never seen you.?
? In our house ? ?
? Yes, it?s theirs now.?
Then a silence came, and the clinging arms
clung closer, and the soft little face lay on his
shoulder. And he sat stiller than ever, for the
strangeness of this earthly caress held him.
? Won?t you take me back to mother, please??
She said it in a childish, coaxing way. Then
he dropped his arm and gathered the little figure
close to him and held her firmly. And he turned
the little face up to his.
?Your mother is dead,? he said.
? But what's dead ? ? asked Mary. ? Dead like
the flowers go and the chickens ? ?
He said ? Yes,? endeavouring to grasp what
death must sound like to one who had never
seen it. And he lifted her on his knee and tried
to make her understand.
He did not show her death as life, and he told
her nothing about Heaven, and very little about
God. But he talked to her of tired people and
heartbroken people, and gave her an idea of


what rest is. So that death was to her translated
as rest.
She watched his face, her eyes a soft, serious
grey. And he knew from her words that she had
been thinking of him more than of his talk.
? I like you better than my grandfather,? she
said.
? Do you ? ? he said.
? Yes. I don?t like him at all. Can I have
you instead of him ? ?
? No,? he said gravely. ? God ties our forbears
like millstones round our necks. It is our fathers
and grandfathers in us that drag some of us to
the gallows.?
? What are the gallows ? ? asked the child.
And he looked into the shining depths of her
clear eyes, upon the unsullied purity of her face,
and a groan burst from his bps. For he had
been willing that the brand of Cain should rest
on her brow so that Philip?s should go unmarked
through this world and into the next.
Now the face of things was changing.
? Run and play with Philip,? he said.
But she shook her head.
? He hates dolls,? she said, ? and Pm tired of
being his wife.?
? His wife ! ? said Mr. Allars ; then he looked
at her and began to laugh.
o o
The sensitive little face reddened.
?He says it?s good for me,? said the child,
?but I?d rather just be a little girl and go home
to mother.?
Footsteps came up the path.


? Tricksy ! ? called Philip.
? That?s me,? said Mary with a breath-catch,
and nodding into the old man s face.
Then Philip came round the corner.
Mary folded her arms tighter round Mr. Allars?
neck.
? We?re talking,? she said, ? go away?we?re
talking! ?
And Philip stood stock still at this strange
sight. For his grandfather?s arm lay round his
little wife?s waist ?or what would probably be a
waist in years to come.
And all that tenderness had come because a
favourite horse had died at noon ?and the sun
had set in more than usual beauty.
But after that Mary claimed a special gentle-
ness from him.
She loved him with the frankest, most adoring
love, a love utterly devoid of fear. She told him
about it every day, whispered her secrets, which
were minute and multitudinous, to him, watched
him and waved to him from the verandah
morning and evening.
It was a strange thing, this love that grew
between the frank-eyed girl-child and the bent-
shouldered man. But it made a difference in the
lives of every one in the cottage ?excepting,
perhaps, the little brown man?s. He went on his
way just as ever. When his son had lived with
him he had managed to forget his responsibilities,
and to shift them to his friend?s shoulders. And
now that he was a grandfather it was the same.
But Mr. Allars seemed to come, led by the


hand of frolicsome, sweet-eyed Mary, out of a life
of middle-aged dulness to the borderland of
imaginative youth. He even understood?or
misunderstood ?something of the enchantment
of a sea life when he saw* Mary and Philip
squirming over a stubbly lawn, and Numa?s
pathetic smile because he w*as shot for having
failed to do his duty. The glory of a bush-
ranger?s life w*as so forcibly brought home to
him by glowdng-eyed Philip and persuasive-
tongued Mary, that he himself helped to organise
a camp, and he only swore quite mildly when
Mary allowed herself to be ?kidnapped? in the
dead of night.
Until she w*as thirteen she lived the life of a
boy. She learned to ride bare-backed, to swim,
to shoot, play cricket, climb trees, saddle a
horse, milk, throw* stones boy-fashion?which is
totally different from a girl?s w^ay ?talk slang,
and, alas! to swear. It was to be expected,
brought up as she was with three bush-men and
two bush-boys.
But at thirteen she had growm lithe and
strong. Her face was sun-tanned and healthy,
her eyes quick and clear, her figure straight as a
young sapling. She learned to scorn fear, to
obey without question, to depend upon herself,
and to look at honour from a masculine stand-
point. And from all the little feminine vices of
envy, tale-bearing, and petty uncharitableness,
she w*as free. Also she laughed at as many of
her woes as she could, and the others she neither
sulked nor brooded over.


During these years Philip had been riding in
daily to the local public school, and Mary had
been groping along the road to learning under
his somewhat patronising guidance.
Then what is known as the hobble-de-hoy
stage came upon Philip, and Mary passed into
the ? gawky ? and ungainly period.
It was Mr. Allars who first recognised the
fact. They had had a liberal physical education,
and their morals were the best he could give
them.
?We can bring ?em up to be a man and
woman,? said Mr. Allars to the little brown
man, ? and the sort of man and woman the
world needs. But they want more ?
?Eh ? ? said the little brown man, ? they?ll
do.?
? No,? said Mr. Allars thoughtfully. ? No,
they won?t. Now they?ve to be educated.?
? Eddicated % ? said the little brown man.
?Ay ! Educated. Boarding-school for them
both.?
?Be damned ! ? said the little brown man
vehemently.
But Mr. Allars went on quietly.
?You might put Mary into the convent at
Rontleigh,? he said.
? The convent! ? almost screamed the little
brown man. ? Why, that means money. Be
damned! ?
But Mr. Allars had his way. Mary was put
into the convent for five years?years empty of
holidays ; and the bills came home every quarter


to her grandfather. And they were heavy ; and
sometimes he paid them. When he did not,
Mr. Allars did.
One of his stipulations was that what religion
she had she was to find for herself, but instruction
in that branch was to be omitted.
So Mary learnt to play and sing and paint;
to darn, knit, patch, make, and mend. She read
about other worlds and orbits, and attractions,
and so forth. She knew a great deal about the
rocks of this earth, and fossils, and veins and
lodes. She could work out an equation, and
had many times crossed the Pons asinorum.
She had read in Latin how Csesar overcame the
Gauls; how iEneas? hair stood on end; in
French Esther?s story and the tragedy of
Athaliah. She knew the extent of every con-
tinent, and had the exports and imports of every
country at her finger-tips.
But of man her knowledge was confined to a
blurred memory of the two old men at home,
Philip, Numa, and Csesar.
When she was eighteen her grandfather sent
for her to go home to be a woman. His letter
said a ?woman,? but he and, Mr. Allars in their
evening communings had said a ? wife.?
OO . .
Mary?s fettered spirits rose. There was a
something within her that bounded and sprang
into life at the mere thought of being a woman.
She sang over the shining glory of it, and longed
to stuff her girlhood away out of sight.
She had read a little Dickens and Thackeray,
much Carlyle and Emerson, selected Browning,


Longfellow, and Tennyson, and she had grown
up with Shakespeare. But of modern novels ?
novels treating of the men and women of to-day
?she had read none.
But now ?to be a woman ! Girlhood she had
tasted of and drained dry. In stepping into
womanhood she felt she would step straight into
another being.
And for an ideal woman, a woman wdiose
being, as it were, she might step into, she took
Esther of ? Bleak House.?
And she did her hair quaintly, and spoke
meekly, and tried to fasten down that bounding
young spirit of hers between the two covers of a
book.
With Philip life had passed more tumultu-
ously. During the third year of his boarding-
school life he had run away and put himself
to sea. That passionate craving of his for
adventure had been too strong to allow him
to read ?Westward Ho!? and ?The Three
Midshipmen,? and take life just as he had
before. Introduced suddenly, as it were, into
the world of fiction, he fell upon any and every-
thing in the shape of a book, and read it with
hungry avidity. His spirit rose against the
monotony of school discipline; and in a burst
of wild enthusiasm he broke away from his
shackles.
And, of course, he took to the sea.
Mr. Allars had two months of gnawing anxiety,
then a pencilled letter from Philip reached him.
When he had read it, even the little brown


man saw the look of surprised relief that ran
over his face.
? It wasn?t his mother, after all,? he said.
? Eh ? ? said the brown man.
? He?s run away to sea. Richard did the
same. I did the same. He?s been down among
the islands.?
? Eh!?
? He?s a young devil-may-care. Says he
means to die a captain. He?s bathed in the
briny, but strikes me he?s had no cuts for the
salt to wash into yet. I?ll go down and see
him.?
The next day he went. He himself, old as he
was, felt a thrill when he saw the blue of the
harbour water, with the ferry-boats plying about
and the vessels? high masts running skyward.
It was a thrill that had come to him all his
life at sight of the sea, notwithstanding he was
an Australian squatter who dreamt wool and
mutton.
He found the vessel he was seeking. A black-
and-white-cargo boat loading coal at a dirty
wharf.
And he crossed the gangway and stood upon
the vessel?s deck and interviewed the captain.
Then there came towards him a betarred sailor
stripling, with a bucket of paint in one hand and
a rope-clump in the other.
It was Philip. Philip with a sun-tanned face
and happy, careless eyes, a sailor?s song on his
lips, and many sailorish gestures and speeches
and ways about him ?a happy sailor lad.


Mr. Allars was disappointed over his unmis-
takable happiness, but he neither upbraided nor
threatened him. And he did not ask him if he
had had enough of it and would not be glad
to go back to school. For he himself had
been a sailor lad, and he knew how to read
SioTLS.
he did not intend that his grandson
should die a sea-captain.
Philip was exultant. In half-an-hour he had
rattled off stories of hair-breadth escapes, of
dangers braved and hardships endured, and all
with the old eager glow in his eyes. And Mr.
Allars nodded and smiled, for he knew Philip?s
romancing powers, and he had had it from the
captain that the trip had been unremarkable and
particularly smooth.
?Then you?ll be willing to stay on this
boat \ ? he asked, looking down into the shining
eyes.
? Willing ! ? Philip protested his willingness
excitedly.
? Because there is a boat running down to New
Zealand ?I could get you on, as you?re set on
being a sailor.?
? We?re going to Ceylon and Bombay,? said
the lad. ? And to Shanghai and Japan. We?re
going everywhere. No, I?ll not shift for a trip
or two. It?s all experience. In six months I?ll
know all there is to be known about a brig.?
?So long as six months ! And then ? ?
?Well, then I?ll go more into navigation
itself. I study it in my spare time a good deal


now. I know a tremendous lot about the island
waters already.?
?Yes, I knew more at your age than at any
other. It?s the knowing age, isn?t it, my lad ? ?
? Oh, you?d soon pick it up again,? said Philip
encouragingly. ? There are a few little currents
knocking round. Nasty little spots, but you?d
soon pick it up.?
So Philip went to Japan and Shanghai, and
to Bombay and Ceylon, and nearly two years
went by.
Mr. Allans had not meant the effects of his
diplomacy to endure so long, and when the boat
came in he went down to Sydney again.
And he saw the captain, and the captain gave
him briefly the story of the voyage. And how
Philip had left him at Ceylon, as he had half
expected he would, and had set out to join the
Australian troops in the Soudan.
So Mr. Allars went home again with a new
anxiety at his heart. And he and the little
brown man read every cablegram and story that
came across the sea from the African land. And
Mary, who had found a God of her own by now
?a God whom she treated reverently like an
all-wise Parent?Mary prayed every night for
soldier Philip as she had never forgotten to pray
for sailor Philip.
Another year came and went, bringing at
last a great eventful day to the little southern
colony.
The troops came home again. And all the
offices in Sydney were closed, and the shops put


up their shutters, or pulled down their blinds,
and the people crowded the balconies, pavements,
railings, parks, the quay, and the harbour.
And Philip came marching home! Several
other people came marching home, too, but this
story has only to do with Philip. . ?
There was blowing of bugles, and beating of
drums, and the flash of steel, and the clash of
horses? hoofs. And waving of handkerchiefs, and
shouting of men, and weeping of women.
But in all that vast throng of excited wel-
coming faces there was not one that smiled
for Philip, not one hand put out to grasp his,
not one tear glistening because he had come
And he felt far, far lonelier and sadder with
his foot pressing his native land again than he
had sailing away, his eyes turned to strange
countries.
But two days later he received his discharge
and was free, and then with all the uncurbable
eagerness that had carried him to the sea, he
turned towards his far inland home.
And he travelled with his soldier s knapsack
through part of a day and a night, and he
reached the up-country little platform.
And it struck him with amazement that
everything looked exactly as it had looked upon
the day when he had gone back to school.
The station-master?s shanty, the weatherboard
shed for passengers, the rough two-railed fence
around the platform, nothing had been added to,
nothing had been taken away, as far as he could


see. And how many lives he had lived since
then ??a school-boy?s life, a sailor?s life, and a
soldier?s life.
He walked to the Royal Hotel, recalled himself
jovially to the innkeeper, and received a wringing
hand welcome home.
Then he set out and rode as quickly as he
knew- how, which was very quickly indeed,
through a slowly-descending evening. And he
came to the old slip-rail and switched it down,
and rode on, forgetting to put it up again. He
stared hard at his old vessel?s deck, which, being
interpreted, means the cottage roof.
Then he dismounted, slipped his reins over an
old nail on the wood-shed wall, whispered a
greeting to two leaping dogs, and went in by
way of the kitchen.
In the dining-room a big unshaded lamp shed
a flaring light over a bare-looking dinner-table.
Mr. Allars sat at one end facing the door, and
the little brown man at the other facing the
window. Between them was a stretch of what
had once been a white table-cloth, the centre
cruets, and a covered dish of meat. The little
brown man was eating audibly, and without
raising his eyes. Mr. Allars was eating and
reading at the same time.
Then Philip came in.
He walked down the room, and
neither old men looked up, being used to Numa?s
light footstep about the place. He took one
stride more, and then he laughed, for he was
enjoying this thing greatly.


?Eh?? said the little brown man, and he
dropped half a potato back to his plate.
Mr. Allars sprang up, and a smile, such as
Philip had never seen before, came into his face.
He had to clear his throat twice before he could
speak, and then he only said ?
? Confound you, Pip.?
But later that night, he and the little brown
man settled it all very comfortably about Mary
and this soldier stripling and a certain small
homestead close at hand with an excellent sheep-
run to it.
So that was how the letter went bidding Mary
come away from her cloister and be a woman.
Only both of the old men said ?wife? in con-
fidence to their pipes.


CHAPTER II
For a week Philip tasted station-life, shared
by day with Numa, by night with the two old
men, and he found it wanting. Numa was
sullenly jealous of his soldiers equipment and
heavy moustache, and openly jealous of the
glory of his past. Cattle-stealing, wife-kidnap-
ping, bushranging, all sank into the most trifling
insignificance before the thrilling romances of
this travelled young giant.
So Numa slunk into the background and
sulked. But at night he crept to a bed-room
window and listened to the verandah talk.
Mr. Allars did not speak much, and the little
brown man chiefly cackled; but Philips stories
flashed forth ceaselessly, wrapped in a cloak of
glorious adventure.
But on the sixth day there were rumours and
signs of other things to be.
The little brown man returned to the bed-room
off the pantry, and the snug little verandah room
was turned out and scrubbed.
And a new set of mosquito nets came home.
Both of these changes meant that Mary was
coming.


Philip fell to thinking of her a great deal upon
the seventh day. He tried to recall her face,
and he told himself that he recollected her eyes
perfectly. In his mind he saw them china-blue,
and her hair a pale dead gold. For so he
endowed all his dream-women.
On the eighth day she came. His grandfather
drove her to the door one evening, just as the
little brown man was sitting down to his
dinner. This was the time that train-arrivals
came.
It all happened in a commonplace prosaic
manner, which struck Philip as remarkable on
a later day. Remarkable that he was not
watching for her with a palpitating heart and
restless eyes.
He was cutting bread with a clean scientific
cut, and whistling half under his breath.
Then the door was pushed open, and he looked
up.
Her hair was not blonde at all, but dark. It
came in a point on her forehead, and lay
around her temple in little self-made curls.
Her eyebrows were just two dark straight lines,
and her lashes were neither very long nor
curled.
He knew at once that she was not pretty; but
later?not so very much later, either?an angel
from heaven could not have convinced him that
she was not beautiful.
She blushed at his startled searching gaze, and
he offered her the bread-knife instead of his hand
in his embarrassment; and the frankness of her


laugh seemed to brush away the frost the years
had been making.
? Why, you didn?t know I was coming,? she
said.
? I?X didn?t know when,? he replied stum-
blingly.
She went forward and offered her cheek to her
grandfather. But he drew back quickly.
� ?Be hanged !? he said. Which was polite of
him, for on ordinary occasions he would have
said ?Be damned.?
Philip sprang forward and blustered a little,
but Mary laughed.
? He doesn?t know any better,? she said.
He saw that her eyes held mischief, and he
called her ?Tricksy? on the spot.
That night tea was a new matter at the cottage.
Philip, in his soldier?s coat (which he donned
sometimes in evenings, to the chagrin of Numa),
sat opposite to Mary, who was habited like a
little Puritan. And the two grandfathers sat
face to face, just as in the days of seven years
ago. And talk flew.
Philip retold some of his stories, with embel-
lishments ; and Mary?s eyes widened, and the
colour ran about in her cheeks, till one marvelled
at its agility. And Numa waited at table with
a wdde smile on his face throughout the meal,
and his eyes hardly left Mary?s face, and his ears
drank in all she said.
? It needs the young to make a home,? Mr.
Allars said to himself that night as he drew his
mosquito nets.


Philip looked at the streak of light Mary?s
candle made on the verandah.
?It needs a woman to make a home, he said
to the streak.
And the little brown man flashed his candle
round his room.
? Wish they?d hurry and get the thing fixed
up,? he said. ? T?other room?s a sight better?n
this.?


CHAPTER 111
Mary was very earnest in her desire to be ah
ideal woman.
The great difficulty was, which ideal woman.
There were so many of them, she found.
Laura of ? Pendennis,? Esther of ? Bleak
House, ? Florence of ?Dombey and Son,? Dorrit
of ? Little Dorrit, - ? were all chiselled the same,
into the same image, with the same smile and
frown?to her mind. She fancied the true
heroine was a facsimile of sweet Alice whom Ben
Bolt knew, one who ? wept with delight if you
gave her a smile, and trembled with fear at your
frown.?
But her ideals changed.
T
It was through Philip that the emotional
novel fell into her hands. She ransacked his
books, which were many and miscellaneous,
gathered chiefly during his school-life and his
voyages, and left behind him. But both his
school-master and his captain had given them to
his grandfather.
Within a mouth Mary had tried to model her-
self after the character of the fascinating little
heroine in ?Not Wisely but too Well,? Mrs,
190


Burnett?s ?Dolly,? Miss Braddon?s ?Vixen,?
and ? The Princess of Thule.?
She was eighteen, and the ?World of Romance?
was to her more real than ideal. The people who
moved there she made her people, herself, and
her world ?as far as a very active imagination
could.
And Philip served excellently for a hero.
Compared with Arthur ot ? Pendennis, with
Vixen?s ? Roderick,? with Richard of ? Bleak
House ? ?with nearly every book hero she rated
Philip a little before them all.
And she saw it was quite in the ? List of
Things to be Expected? that they two should
fall in love with each other.
She was not shy in the least over it, and she
could neither blush nor thrill when his voice
sounded in the hall, or his little finger touched
her little finger.
Only twice did he really sink in her estimation.
Once was wiien she was steeped in Dollyism, and
Philip did not tally with Donne. Donne was
refreshingly thin, and miserable, and poor, and
tragic, and Philip could not be termed one of
these even by his tenderest friend. The other
time was when she was revelling in the misery of
those who loved not wisely but too well. Look-
ing at Philip, she could be almost certain he had
no wife in the background, and consequently
the rapture of being romantically wretched was
withheld from them.
She had not then reached the wisdom of
smiling at the folly of her thoughts.


Philip suffered somewhat during these moods.
He had had enough of life to show him the
margin between the real and ideal. That did
not prevent him from straying in either realm ;
but on the whole, he preferred the real infinitely,
and felt its intenseness and intoxication more
every day.
He, too, had seen into the ? List of Things to
be Expected,? and he had read it written down
that he would love Mary unto the end of his
life! And this, whether she ever loved him
back again or not.
She was very kind to him, but so was his
grandfather. And she believed in him implicitly,
but so did Numa.
He felt it deeply that she never blushed for
him, and that her eyes always met his in that
wide sweet glance.
He himself was so impregnated with what he
had seen written down long ago on the ? Scroll
of Ages,? that the red mounted into his cheeks
whenever he thought of it, and the sight of her
bustling and busy about the house was an en-
chantment.
He went away in the morning, and she would
be gardening perhaps, or cooking, sleeves up
elbow high, and a white apron round her. And
they would say ? Good-bye ? in the kitchen, on
the verandah, in the hall, anywhere, he lingeringly,
she serenely.
He would return in the evening?early always
?and she would be sewing, or knitting, or paint-
ing, or reading, and they would greet each other,


he with a look that was almost a caress, she with
a frank welcoming smile.
At the end of a month the burden of her smile
seemed greater than he could bear. A great
discontent at her serene content shook him, so
that he felt these days and these w r ays to be
intolerable.
But the woman?s presence made a great differ-
ence in the house. A work-basket came into the
dining-room, big hats with flowers and muslin on
them lay about the hall. Little shoes with
shapely heels stood amongst the big boots for
Numa?s cleaning. Bright-coloured blouses came
home with the shirts on a Saturday night, and
waited with them on the dining-room table to be
overlooked.
Mr. Allars talked a little more and laughed
frequently. And often during his evening?s
smoke he looked through the dining-room
window to the two young faces round the
lamp-lit table.
But there came a night during a w r eek of
# o^o
moonlit nights when, looking through that
window, he saw the room that it was empty.
Then he turned himself round and caught a
gleam of a white dress in the moonlight beyond
the slip-rails.
? : Ee?s goin? to tell her a story to-night, instead
of readin? ?er one, ? said the little brown man
with excited volubility.
And Mr. Allars stood still and took his pipe
from between his lips, for the importance of that
story was enormous to him.


CHAPTER IV
They stood just beyond the slip-rails together
?Philip and Mary. Above them was the
Southern Cross, a sky strewn with star-dust and
a three-quarter moon. Around, the tall still bush
trees, slim saplings, giant gums, and wattles.
Beyond ?a very short distance?the cottage and
the two old men. And quite close at hand, in
the shadow of a clump of saplings, Numa. He
wore one of Philip?s military coats, a high white
collar, and a brown pee-wee hat. And he held a
silver-topped stick quite in the approved way
for holding silver-topped sticks.
He had been walking up and down and round
about displaying the beauty of his borrowed
plumes to the moon and the trees, and prouder
of them than any peacock of his feathers.
Then there had come to him the sound of foot-
steps upon dried leaves, and the whispering of
voices.
And he had turned round and seen them?
Philip and the girl. The girl whom he had
tormented and teased, whose boots he had to
clean,.and who was winning Philip?s love, and
194


his dog?s love, and the love of even the lame old
jackass away from him.
In his heart was a consuming jealousy casting
out every other feeling but discretion.
He had lost the first part of the story, but he
pressed close to see what w r as left.
? You like me ? ? Philip asked, his voice
stumbling: over the verb.
Mary whispered ?Yes? with the moonlight
streaming into her eyes.
? You?love me ? ? ventured Philip, bolder,
Mary?s eyes fell and a little tremor came into
her voice. A faint ?Yes? tripped over her
tongue again.
O O
And the rapture of that confession to Philip
was such that it struck silence sharp upon it.
He raised her hand to his lips and kissed the
back of it reverently. Then he turned it over
and kissed the soft little palm and blue-veined
wrist.
? Say it,? he begged.
She hesitated. Then she felt he was trembling,
and the glow in his eyes of earnest, hot, all-
absorbing love struck her as beautiful. The
smallest of small thrills ran through her.
? I love you! ? she said, and felt how stupid
she was not to say more, or feel more, or show
more. This beautiful, passionate love all for her !
? I love you ! ? she said again, and she looked
up at him with the frankest and steadiest of
smiles. For she really believed she did love
him, and moreover she was very desirous of
doing so.


Every one of her ideal women were or had
been in love.
Philip put out his arms and drew her into
them, holding her very closely and tenderly.
Then he removed one of his hands and slipped
it under her chin, turning her face upwards to
his.
She smiled at him softly, but the divine and
unmistakable flash of love was not in her eyes.
? You don't love me ?you don't love me ! ? he
said miserably, with a very passion of pleading
in his voice.
? Oh, yes, I do,? she said cheerfully; ? I love
you very much indeed''
? Would you die for me ?? he demanded. ?If
I were dying, would you feel you couldn?t live ? ?
? Yes?of course ! ? she said promptly.
He almost groaned.
? If I had to live in a hut, could you take life
so with me ? ?
Was not this romantic ? She felt she had
read it somewhere.
? Sooner than live in a 'palace with any one
else,? she said. There was a certain grace about
the words for all they were spoken rather parrot-
fashion.
? Then don?t look at me like that,?' he said.
? How ? ? she asked in amazement.
?As if I were your brother, or your grand-
father. Look here, Mary, sometimes your smile
sends me half mad.? He said it miserably.
Her eyes widened and two pretty perplexed
wrinkles came to her forehead.


? How am I to smile ? ? she said, and half
laughed.
? I can?t tell you,? he said hopelessly. ? But
if our two grandmothers lived with us, do you
think I should look at them like this?"
This was a glance of passionate, tender love.
? No,? she said, and hung her head.
But he slipped his hand under her chin and
turned her face up again. And he bent and
pressed his lips to hers.
At that she shook herself free, angrily.
? I beg your pardon,? he said, feeling at the
first sight of her face that he had offended
greatly.
?We never said anything about hissing ,? she
said stiffly.
? No. I know.?
? And?l don?t like it! ?
?You said you would die for me.?
? Perhaps ! ? with an eye-flash.
? Or live in a hut with me.?
? Well, we needn?t hiss because of that.?
He looked at her for a second, and his face
quivered and whitened. What this rebuff was to
him she could not guess.
He leaned his head on his arm on the fence-
top.
For a second she watched him, and the anger
ran away out of her heart.
After all, all her ideal women were kissed, and
kissing.
She went closer and slipped one arm round
the back of his neck.


? I was a beast! ? she said penitently.
? No,? he said in a stifled voice.
? I?m sorry now.?
?You couldn?t help it?and your eyes ! ?
? I love you ? ?tenderer than any ? I love
you?s ? yet.
? You?re an angel,? he said, straightening him-
self suddenly, ? and you don?t understand love ?
that?s what it is.?
? No. I?m a woman, and I do understand
love.?
But she looked very little-girlish indeed.
? Kiss me,? she begged, and held up her face
penitently.
And he kissed her.
But that kiss was quite a different matter
from the sweet spoilt one.


CHAPTER V
For three days Philip kept this love of his a
secret, or, rather, thought that he did.
But Numa knew all about it. And Numa
told Caesar. And Caesar told his Jidus Achates,
the cook down at the Royal Hotel. And the
cook told a chambermaid, who told several other
people ?some who were interested in the event
and some who were not.
Then Mr. Allars knew, and the little brown
man knew?or they both thought they did.
On the fourth day Philip remembered himself
of a performance through which book heroes
almost invariably passed. And he told it to
Mary, who remembered that book heroines under-
went it. And that it led to woes and complica-
tions and excitements without end.
? I must ask your grandfather for you,? Philip
said, ? and I must tell my grandfather we are
engaged.?
o O _
Mary?s eyes shone and her spirits rose. For
this sounded like the beginning of things to her.
The declaration of love was but the prelude.
So Philip went to the little brown man in the
bed-room off the pantry.
199


? I?ve come to tell you something important,?
he said.
?Eh,? said the little brown man.
?Of course you will be astonished. In fact, I
suppose every one will. It is one of those unex-
pected things that ought to have been expected
from the be^innino;.?
O O
? Eh,? said the little brown man.
? I have come to ask your consent to my
marrying Mary.? Philip?s eyes were luminous.
? Marrying Mary his first utterance of those
words cast such a light in his heart that his eyes
flashed forth its reflection.
? Eh,? said the little browm man.
He was unfastening a boot, kneeling on one
knee upon the floor. He never even raised his head.
Philip sat down on the foot of the bed and
fixed his eyes on the stubbly grey hair.
He was not going to have the honour of this
thing curtailed.
? I have loved her,? he said, ? ever since she
was a little thing in a pinafore, I think. There
has never been any other girl in my life?there
never will be. I went away and 1 roughed it on
sea and land, and I have come back, and I still
love Mary.?
He said it with his eyes looking far away
through the wall, probably to the Soudan, where
he had ? roughed ? it.
The old man began to laugh his hideous, dry
cackle.
? Have you thought ?bout money ? ? he asked.
?My grandfather made �5,000 over to me


when I came from the Soudan. If I marry to
suit him he?s promised me another �5,000 and
the homestead at Buhara.?
The old man unlaced his other boot in silence.
? Well ? ? asked Philip sharply, for he felt this
was an empty honour he was paying Mary, and
an absurd deference to her grandfather.
? Well, hurry up, the two o? you. I could ?ave
fixed it in ?arf the time. This room?s got the rats
in it somethink orful,?
Philip then sought his own grandfather. He
found him on the verandah, finishing his pipe.
So, standing up and holding his head well back,
he began to tell him the most important story in
the world.
Almost at the first words of it Mr. Allars
nodded and gravely removed his pipe from
between his lips.
He had been accustomed to taking trips into
the realms of the young more lately and more
frequently than the little brown man.
? I have been hoping this, my lad,? he said.
Then he pushed a chair forward with one foot
and added, ? Sit down. But first fetch Mary.
Before you tell me your story, I have one which
I must tell to the two of you.?
So they sat on the verandah together, those
three. And Philip fixed his eye on Mary?s face,
and Mary fixed hers on Mr. Allars, and Mr.
Allars did all the talking.
He told them a brief story of the boyhood and
youth and very early manhood of two, who were
their fathers.


He left tenderness out, and dealt in unchiselled
facts.
When he came to the story of the French
ballet-girl and the clandestine marriages, both of
the young faces flushed in the semi-darkness.
For Mary wondered over her mother, and
Philip felt if his father had married in the face of
a prohibition he would have felt prouder.
There was a long pause after the story of the
marriages.
O
?After all,? said Mary, ?clandestine marriages
were quite the rage once.?
Mr. Allars laughed and picked up his thread
again.
He hid the story of the forgeries because they
were sins against him only, and because he had
never told them to any soul upon this earth, and
never meant to. They no more belonged to the
world, nor to these two, than did any of the
youthful pranks and sins of his boy Richard. No
disgrace from them could possibly reach these
two.
But the end of the tale came haltingly, sorrow-
fully.
It was of the blood-stained road, of the blood-
tracks reaching down rocks to the sea, of a blood-
stained boat picked up on the wide waters of
the Pacific, face downward, and battered and
wrecked. And of the total disappearance of
their two fathers.
It was a weird and terrible story, despite its
rough recital.
? And pray God the Pacific was the grave of


both/? said Mr. Allars at last, his gaze going
swiftly from one white young face to the other.
? It was, of course,?? said the boy and girl in a
breath.
Mr. Allars spoke of his doubts.
? A trader reported afterwards,? he said,
? having picked up a man off Gabo. He was
almost past speaking, and had stripped oft all his
clothes, and was clinging to a spar. But who
that man was we have never known from that
day to this.?
A groan burst from Philip?s lips.
? It was either my father?or hers,? he said.
? It was either my father?or his,? said Mary.
? Ay! ? said Mr. Allars, ? but they have
tracked and hunted him over the earth ?from otf
the face of it, one would think. We have heard
no more of him?and never shall, please God.?
Then he leaned back in his chair and watched
these two ?the children of those other children.
? It seems to me ?and has done for years,? he
said, ?that it will fix up the wrong for you two
to care for one another. Seems as if your love
will cover their sin. Maybe I?m wrong. You
take each other under a cloud, as it were ?where
none can see but you two. And for better or
worse, as no one else but you knows. And if
your love will shine you through it ?why, God
be praised ! ?
He got up, moved stumblingly ?a few paces,
knocked his pipe on the verandah edge, and
went away.
Philip and Mary looked at each other linger-


ingly, and the tears lay thickly in the girl?s
eyes.
Then she left her chair, moved over to him,
and pressed soft lips upon his forehead.
? If your father,? she whispered, ? I will kiss
it away.? She knelt down and raised her face.
? And if mine,? she went on, ? you must.?
And he kissed her on her w 7 hite forehead,
under the darks of her hair.
So in the faint moonlight they kissed away the
sins of their father ?the brand of Cain?from
whichever brow it might rest upon. And they
folded their arms tightly around each other?s
neck, and laid their faces close together.
The tears were in Mary?s eyes, for she felt very
sorry ?for them both. And a dead weight lay
on Philip?s heart, because he felt sorry for them
both.
But they were no more than sorry. For the
darkness of the past belonged to the past, and
they were now in the halcyon present. And they
were both young, and forgotten of the world?
they thought.


CHAPTER VI
Mary began to feel that the crown of woman-
hood ?that glorious magic crown ?was of common
garden flowers.
She could not find words to express it in?
there were no words exactly fitting her case-
hut it was as though she were losing her appetite
for life.
Everything seemed flat and dull. Every one
did the very same things, at the very same times,
every day.
She read a great deal, leaving the house to
Numa?s care, and the kitchen and cooking to
Csesar?s.
And after she had been for two
months, ? Monotony of monotonies! ? said her
heart. ? All is monotony ! ?
Not one of her books dealt with life on a
lonely Australian station ?not one of her heroines
had for companions by day only two black men,
two dogs and a jackass, and for the evening
hours two old men and one young one.
Every day, too, Philip seemed less and less
likely to display the scar or skeleton of a past
tragedy. Every day the real tragedy of their


own two infantile existences sank into a little
deeper oblivion, sank and sank, until it only
seemed to belong to some remote ancestors, and
not to themselves at all.
So she lost her relish for the days, and did not
care whether they came or went, or stood still.
And she grew a little pale, though no one
noticed it, and her eyes grew tristful, and her
step slow, and???Monotony of monotonies ! ?
said her heart. ? All is monotony ! ?
But still the days came to her, and still she
took them up. Hot summer days, with a blazing
sun in the heavens, windless days, when the
dogs lay panting under the trees or on the
verandah, and tropical thunderstorms came in
the evenings to clear the air for more heat on the
morrow. Dry scorching days, when little rain
fell on the land, and the grass grew brown and
withered up, and the sheep died, bush fires raged,
and snakes and rabbits throve everywhere.
That was a dreadful summer. There was an
evening when Philip and the two old men did
not return at all. Mary, looking out from the
verandah, and seeing the dense smoke that lay
round like an atmosphere, knew that it would be
the bush fires that were keeping them.
So she went inside and sat down to a lonely
table.
The table, at least, was daintier for her pre-
sence. The cloth was always clean, and the one
pot plant the house possessed stood in the centre
beside the cruets.
To-night she ate with a book beside her. She


was devouring the history of ?Jane Eyre? with
avidity, and she did not mind the non-arrival of
the others in the least.
But the evening dropped away sluggishly, and
night came on.
Then she went to the verandah again. All
around, as far as the eye could sweep, were bush
fires. She was not alarmed at them in the least
?for quite half of her life she had been accus-
tomed to these summer ravages, and she had
helped to beat many a one out.
So she watched them from a lounge chair on
the verandah, and tried to keep the mosquitoes
at bay by wafting her book about.
Caesar lounged out and flung himself on the
lawn, and Numa came out and watched, too.
Presently Mary saw, leaning upon the fence near
the slip-rails, the figure of a man. He was stand-
ing as one who is at home and lounging stands,
or as one in doubt whether to enter or go away
again.
O
Numa smiled and made a low sibilant sound.
Immediately the dogs bounded forward, and
darted, barking, down the path.
? Call off the dogs ! ? ordered Mary. ? How
dare you, Numa ! ?
Numa made another sibilant sound, and at
once two panting animals stood beside him.
?Now,? said Mary, ? you go down and see
who it is.?
But Numa did not move.
??lm can come up,? he said.
A flash of anger came into the girl?s eyes.


? Go at once 1 ? she said.
But Numa blankly refused.
?Me not do?s you tell me,? he said. ? You o- 0
?long.?
It was his first act of insubordination to her.
She had caught muttered words before, but never
a direct refusal to obey.
She remembered now a suggestion of Philip?s
a few days back, one that had rejoiced her heart,
but had been vetoed by the old men.
It was that she should have a female com-
panion?a working housekeeper?a lady help ?
any one female to share her loneliness.
But Mr. Allars had asked: ?What are you
going to do with her when you?ve married her ?
I?m not going to have a tame female cat about
my house, I can tell you ! ?
? Marry er! Marry ?er! ? said the little
brown man. ? And female fiddlesticks ! ?
But to-night in her loneliness Mary wished
wildly for a woman?just any woman.
Then she wished for Philip.
? Csesar,? she said, ?go down to the rails
and see who it is.?
But Caesar was snorino-.
The man at the fence apparently understood
matters, for he dropped the top rail, stepped over
the other, and walked up the path.
He eyed the dogs nervously.
When he came to the verandah they growled,
but Numa talked to them in a language unintel-
ligible to all others, and they stayed beside
him.


The man removed his hat, seeing Mary, and
spoke with a gentleman?s accent.
? 1 wish to see Mr. Philip Allars very particu-
larly,? he said.
? He is not at home,? said the girl.
The man?s face fell. It w r as a clean-shaven face,
and looked refined, from what could be seen of it
in the summer night.
? I am very sorry,? he said. ? I am very
sorry, for it was important.?
? Will you leave a message ? ? asked Mary,
? or come to morrow ? ?
The man considered for a minute or two.
Then he went up the steps and stood beside her
on the verandah.
Mary had two swift thoughts.
The first was that she had her revolver ready
loaded inside her bed-room.
The second, that she or Philip had in all pro-
bability a father wandering about, and perhaps
haunting his old home.
A sinking feeling came to her heart, and she
peered into the man?s face anxiously.
?My name is Rawson,? said the man;
? though that hardly matters at all. I was
here once as tutor to Philip ?for a few hours.?
? les. I heard of you,? said Mary, wondering.
? I tell you that to reassure you, and because,
if you tell Philip what I am going to ask you to,
he may understand why I came instead of any
one else.?
The girl nodded.
? I come from his mother,? said Rawson


? Nine years ago, in the impetuosity of my boy-
hood, I ran away from here to ?to ?absolutely
because I wanted to play Romeo to her Juliet.?
? And did you ? ? asked Mary quickly.
Rawson laughed, a cynical, half-held-back
laugh, such as Mary had often read of, but never
heard before.
? I did not,? he said somewhat tragically,
? but I played Paris. Well, I come to ask him
?as I asked him before?to go to her. She is
in the township for to-night and till twelve to-
morrow.?
? Oh ! ? exclaimed Mary.
? Not performing,? continued Rawson. ?Merely
resting on her way through to Sydney.?
? Is she acting still ? ? asked the girl.
?Still !? said Rawson. ?Why, of course she is,?
She drew a deep breath. There rushed through
her mind the image of a wrinkled wreck, whirling
mazily through life for her daily bread.
She felt a little sorry for her.
? Poor old thing,? she said below her breath.
? I believe,? said Rawson, ? that it is positive
agony to her to be in this place and not see her
boy. It seems more than she can bear.?
? Why ? ? asked Mary.
? She is the most tender-hearted woman alive.
I believe it almost killed her to give Philip up at
all.?
Mary?s heart yearned suddenly for this mother-
love.
? You will ask him to come ?persuade him ? ?
asked Rawson.


She nodded. ?He shall come,? she said.
? At ten in the morning to the Royal Hotel,
Miss Wharton.?
? How did you know my name ? asked Mary
quickly.
? From Philip?s mother and the hotel people,?
he said.
After he had gone ?long after ?Mary be-
thought herself of Numa.
?Go to bed ! ? she said haughtily.
But he did not move.
She leaned towards him.
?In the morning,? she said, ?Mr. Philip shall
thrash you with a stock-whip, and the master
will thrash you with a strap till the blood
comes! ?
She said it harshly, flashed her eyes, and set
her soft little mouth firmly.
Numa looked at her, and his lower lip fell.
Then he rose and slunk oft' kitchenwards, and to
bed.
And Mary laughed at her own ingenuity.
In less than ten minutes she was sleeping.
And no door or window in the house was locked;
and of such is the trust of Australian bush-folk.
When the dawn was streaking the grey with
pink, Mr. Allars, the little brown man, and
Philip rolled home, almost drunken with sleep
and weariness.


CHAPTER VII
It was ten o?clock in the morning, and Philip
was going up the staircase at the Royal Hotel
once again in search of Felise.
He was more nervous even than upon his last
visit.
Rawson met him in the doorway, and went a
few stairs up with him, talking very little.
He nodded to the corridor.
? The second door on,? he said. ? I shall
leave you now.?
But Philip caught his sleeve.
?You had better come with me,? he said.
? She is a total stranger to me, you know.?
Rawson shook his head.
? I have a little sense of the fitness of things,?
he said gravely. ? Second door on,? and he
moved away.
So Philip went up alone, and very slowly.
He found the ? second door on,? but opposite,
almost, was another door, and that also was the
? second on.?
He took the one on his right without even
noticing, merely counting two from the stairs.
There was nervousness even in his hands now.


His mother! Name of sacredness and tender-
ness! How the thought of her brought the
manliness into his heart and the shame into his
throat.
His mother!? and he was ashamed of her.
He knocked at the door loudly, and was bidden
enter.
The room was dull with half-drawn blinds,
and but little sunshine in it.
Heavy maroon curtains were at the window;
sitting-room furniture scattered round.
He went half-way across the floor, his head
thrown back, his eyes straining over the room.
He heard a little gasp of surprise from the
window.
Sitting on a low chair, with the heavy red
shutting overmuch light from her, was one, half-
girl, half-woman, apparently. Her face was
hardly discernible to him, coming from the light
outside into this gloom.
? I?l believe you expected me,? he said. He
tried to think of words, appropriate, not ungentle
words, but his vocabulary failed him.
She caught her breath. It was a sound like
a sob after overmuch weeping. Hearing it, his
sense of shame sank, and his manliness rose.
? 1 had not expected you yet; I did not think
you would come,? she began.
She rose to meet him, but her face was bent
and drooping, and shaded with one hand. He
knew at once that she had been crying.
?My ?mother !? he said half aloud. At that
she threw back her head a little, and looked at


him. And a smile ran over her face. The next
moment she laughed almost hysterically, and
covered her face up with both hands.
Philip was disappointed. His nature, romantic
and chivalric, clamoured for a greeting other
than a laugh after this space of years.
He put his hands to her wrist and tried to
uncover her face.
?You seem a very little mother,? he said
gently.
She laughed again.
?You look very strong ?and tall,? she said.
? A man ! You make me feel ridiculously little
?and old.?
? Lift up your face ?and let me remember you
?mother,? he said.
Then he lowered his head and her hands, and
kissed her upon her cheek.
She gasped, and fled away from him across the
room. At the door she stood still.
? Y r our mother ! ? she said, and laughed again.
1 o o
? I could not help it ?it is too ridiculous.?
The light was shining into her face now, and
he saw it, that it was the face of a young girl.
He stood still, covered with confusion.
? Why didn?t you tell me ? ? he said.
? Why didn?t you ask me % ? she retorted.
Her eyes sought his ; they were shining brown
ones.
?You said the last time you saw me you
would not marry me,? she went on ; ? now you
claim me for a mother ! What next ? ?
He fidgeted, confused and awkward.


? I am very sorry,? he said.
She laughed. ? That lam not your mother ? ?
? No. That I?l ?
She looked down demurely. ? Oh, that you ?
you,? she said.
? Yes,? he said, blushing a little.
? You startled me terribly,? she said in a half-
whisper, and turning as if to leave the room.
He crossed over towards her.
? You hneiv I was not ?your son,? he said.
? How could I understand what you meant ?
I was expecting some one else ?
The door handle was turned slowly on the
outside. Immediately the girl slipped back into
the room. The laughter that had been in her
face went away again, and a little tremulous
smile came to her lips.
Philip watched her in surprise. But a moment
back her lips had been smiling and half scornful,
now they were drooping at the corners, and her
eyes threatened tears. He looked at the door.
A thick-set man in loud checks was hesitating
there.
? I came to see Mr. Bright,? said the man,
perceptibly embarrassed at his intrusion.
? My father ? ? asked the girl.
Philip moved over to the door.
?Your father 1 ?? asked the stranger. ?Well
?can I see him ? ?
The girl?s head fell slightly forward.
?He is very ill,? she said haltingly.
Then Philip closed the door softly and stood
outside in the corridor.


? Poor little thing,? he said to himself.
Opposite him was another door. That also
was number two from the staircase. He knocked
here, and this time the door was opened to him.
There on the threshold stood his mother. He
had not the smallest doubt about that the second
he saw her smile. A flood of memories rushed
over him as she stepped backwards, her eyes
upon his face.
He pushed the door to and went towards her.
? You are my mother,? he said.
This room was fair with sunshine, and he saw
her face. A face of beauty and frank sweetness.
Dark eyes of generosity and compassion. They
softened at his words, and tears came into them,
and the lips trembled.
Then she opened her arms. Such a divine,
motherly, wide embrace.
? Philip?my boy ! My son ! ? she said.
? All shame melted away from him. Such a
beautiful bewitching mother as this he had never
conceived.
? Ah, boy ! ? she whispered, ? what it is to feel
your strong arms round me! Hold me long,
my darling. Every moment is a blot on the
black dead years.?
He kissed her cheek.
?It was you who made them black,? he said.
? hy did you leave me?why did you make
yourself a stranger to me ? ?
? Because your grandfather could give you
what I never could. Ah, mon Dieu ! Philip,?
such a soft sibilant ?Philip.? ?Philip, you


would have grown up on dry bread and sack-
cloth poverty with me 1?
? But you have had it! ?
?Ah ! and rejoiced in it to think what you
were being saved. You know how one by a
warm winter fire loves to hear the rain upon
the roof; but oh, boy, I think you have not
known the love that can take pleasure in being
in the rain and knowing the beloved is by the
winter fire! ?
And this was mother-love ! She searched his
face with her eyes, warm with it, proud with
it, sad with it. And the magic of her look set
his heart on fire with the chivalric desire to aid
and serve her ?as it had fired his father?s heart,
and the hearts of a score or so of other men.
He was bewitched within fifteen minutes by his
own mother.
? I have gone years and years without a sight
of your face,? she went on. ? I gave you up
in your beautiful childhood, and I see you again
in your beautiful manhood.?
He smiled, for the beauty of neither stage had
struck him yet.
?And for me,? she continued sadly, ?in the
years of my beauty you were too young to heed
me; now, when the heavy years are creeping
on ?the years that never forget us women ?you
see me. It is hard that my one and only child
should not have known his mother in the days
I sigh but to remember ! ?
?You could never have been lovelier than
now,? said the boy. The words were as much


a question as a statement, and the truth was in
his eyes.
Felise laughed delightedly.
? Ay, then I have not grown what you would
name a hag ? ? she said.
? I have not seen a young girl in all my life
one quarter as beautiful as you.?'
And no disloyalty to Mary was meant.
She laughed again, and clapped her hands
softly. Her delight shone all over her face.
?That yours is a true saying, your eyes verify,?
she said ; ? but perhaps?may it not be, you are
partial, boy ? ?
Philip laughed.
?Am I to tell you I could envy mv own
father?? he asked.
She grew serious immediately.
?In truth,? she said, ? the angels of God
might have envied us, the way we loved, boy.
That they did is proved by the little while we
had together. He was just such a boy as you?
handsome, strong, and good. Ma foi, I who
have lived amongst boys and men of all countries,
I know how good he was. Bah ! but the silly
little word, good!'
? But was he really ? ? asked the boy eagerly.
? Good ! There was not a man in the world
fit to uncover his head to him. I tell it to you,
Philip, I who was his wife for seven beautiful
years.?
? You must have been a baby-wife,? said the
boy.
Felise was pleased.


? I was,? she said. ?My hair had not been
gathered up then, and my frocks extended not
to the tops of my boots. He had no moustache,
and had just bought his first pipe.?
? I wonder my grandfather did not try to
dispute the marriage,? said Philip, to whom this
story had a double interest.
??He did try. But?he could not move
Richard from me. We were married over again
when he was twenty-one ?just to show him how
we meant it. All the kings in the universe
could not have separated us two.?
Philips heart leapt. The words set his blood
on fire.
? But money?? he asked, with a fierce admira-
tion of his two young parents.
Felise moved her shoulders.
? Money ! ? she said. ? For that we cared
nothing! Besides, we had faith in the good
God, who clothes the lilies and shelters the
sparrows. We said to each other, ?Are not we
two of much more worth than many sparrows ?
Vraiment! Our good Father in Heaven will
care for us, who have so great a love for each
other.? ?
? And ?did He ? ? asked Philip.
?He did. If sweetmeats never came into our
lives?bread was always there. We always had
where to lay our heads. If our clothing was
less glorious than the lilies?we were always
clothed. Who can ask for more ? ?food and
clothing and shelter and a great love.?
? Who ? ? said Philip, his heart on fire.


For a space he sat silent and watched her
her softened, mobile face. Then the wonderment
came to him how death had been able to sever
these lovers.
And what now ? ? she asked, leaning towards
him.
Only I am wondering how you have lived
without ?
. ? You were wondering how I could live with
him dead how he could die with me alive.
And truly, boy, the wonderment is on me yet.
I have lived for seven years, believing him alive.
Now I know it?it was he who was murdered.?
I had rather my father were murdered than
a murderer,? said the boy.
. His mother rubbed the back of her hand upon
his cheek. r
,� This is because of shame! ? she said. ? You
are like him, then. He preferred death to shame.
lam not so. I?l would rather have him
covered over with shame and sin and alive, if
he would not suffer for it. My love is selfish,
boy; it wants him here, in my arms, at any
cost.?
Philip told her haltingly, hesitatingly of Mary,
ihe opportunity gaped, and he filled it in with
the story of his own love.
?Again,? she said, ?our love differs. You
would have her father sin, that yours might go
free. One has sinned, you know. Now fwould
be covered with blackness that he I love might
go white ! ?
And I, said Philip hotly, ? I hadn?t thought.


I was thinking of my father then. Remember-
ing Mary, I conld hope he has sinned..
She pushed him away. ? Oh, you unnatural
and cold,? she said.
And he was surprised at her contrariety.
But when he had told her how he was deter-
mined to renounce his grandfather and his home,
if necessary, and cling to her and protect her
and devote all his money to her, she forgave him
sweetly.
And she talked of Mary again. ?If you should
leave your grandfather?s home hurriedly,? she
said, ? as one does in quarrels, you shall take her to
my home. Stay, if I should have returned, you
shall go to Mrs. Bright?s. But oh ! boy, consider
it,? piteously, ?I, a mother-in-law. Do not, I
implore you.?


CHAPTER VIII
It was late in the afternoon when Philip
returned to the cottage. He walked into the
house with his head very high and a glow of
excitement in his face that Mary had not seen
there for a long time. She interpreted it im-
mediately as something unusual, and from old
experiences knew that anger was not far from
his heart.
She was reading?always she was reading
now. But she raised her eyes to smile a
welcome to him.
Philip looked at her as if deliberating.
? ? ? she asked. ? What is the matter ? ?
Put away your book,? he said, and there was
lurking tragedy in his voice.
So she shut the covers at the crisis where
Jane Eyre is summoned to that midnight scene
in the mad woman?s room.
Then she waited.
He stood away from her, looking down at her
with eyes schooled cold.
? 1 come to set you free,? he said.
A little thrill ran through the girl at his
222


words. Were not they romantic? Were not
they tragical ?
? Have you ? ? she asked, wondering, hut she
neither paled nor trembled.
?Yes,? he said. ?Free as in the days when
you were in your nunnery, and I was in the
Soudan. As free as then, Mary.?
?But why?? she asked, wrinkling up her
forehead in her perplexity.
Then that old idea of hers about a prior
marriage and a vagabond wife pushed itself into
her head. She drew herself up as proudly as
she could, not feeling proud at all.
? Why ? ? he cried excitedly, ? why ? Because
I have found my mother. She gave me up when
I w r as a child that I might have wealth and
plenty. And she has been working about the
world all these years?and will go on working,
as far as I can see, for all the years to come ?
so louo- as she is in the world. Or rather would
have done, only I am here with an arm to work
for her. It is her time to rest.?
? Yes,? said Mary, waiting with large wide-
open eyes.
?So I set you free,? he went on. ? When I
asked you to marry me, I was my grandfather?s
heir. Now lam disinherited.?
He looked very proud about it.
? Why ? ? she asked, capable of no more than
a word.
? Why ? Because I have a will of my own ?
and a mother. I have refused to give her up,
and?this home is mine no longer.?


He waved his hands towards the hall and
verandah.
? But you give me up,? said Mary with a
little sob of hurt pride in her voice. She left
her seat and moved down the hall, that he might
not see the tears in her eyes.
He followed swiftly.
? They have taken you away from me,? he
said sharply.
?Who are they ? n she asked.
? Your grandfather.?
She turned and looked at him. The pain in
his eyes shook her.
? I ivorit be taken,? she said.
The next moment he bad her in his arms.
? Although I am disinherited ? ? he asked,
ihat doesn?t make a bit of difference,? she
said.
�� Then you do love me ! ? he burst out. ? Oh,
my beloved, my beloved ! ?
And she trembled at the passion of love in
his voice and young eager face.
It was as though love were a bud in her heart,
struggling to blossom into full open life, but
withheld by reason of the weakness of its imma-
turity only.
He put his lips to her ear and whispered.
She shook her head vehemently.
� ? No ! no ! no ! ? she said.
�� Then you don't love me.?
That angered her.
<� I do,? she cried. ? I do.?
? Then come away with me now ?to-day.?


? No,? she said again. ?It is wrong. It is
wicked.?
His eyes blazed at her.
? It is the most perfect thing you could do,?
he said. ? Come, come, beloved. I can?t leave
you behind. You with these two old men alone !
Just think of it. Come, my darling! I have
settled it all so beautifully. We will go over to
the islands, and I will get a sugar plantation. I
have still five thousand pounds, you know. And
we will be together?you and I and my mother.?
? No,? she said again. ?No ! no ! ?
But the vehemence was gone from her voice,
leaving it just dull.
?Oh, you little cold thing! ? he said passion-
ately, and his eyes blazed again. ? God in
Heaven ! Why cannot you women love ? ? He
put her from him. The note of real tragedy in
his voice shook her.
?Ido ! Ido ! ? she said. ? I love you better
than any one on earth.?
He swept her into his arms.
?You will come away with me?now ?at
once,? he said ; ? and you will be my wife before
two more suns set.?
His voice was masterful, his eyes almost fierce.
Her mind flew to details.
? It will take a good while to pack up all our
things,? she said. ? And Numa didn?t clean?my
boots this morning.?
O


CHAPTER IX
It was Friday night when they reached
Sydney, dusk on Thursday when they left their
home.
Thursday night had been passed by Mary in
the sleeping-car, by Philip in a smoking-carriage.
For five or six of Friday?s hours they had been
prisoners in a small country town, waiting for
a down train, the previous day?s only running
to a junction a hundred miles from Sydney.
Then they had completed the journey in a
crowded first-class compartment, face to face,
and wedged into their seats by other weary
wayfarers.
Now they were in Sydney; the night was
thick, the rain coming down in sheets, and they
two in a hansom, driving towards their destina-
tion with a couple of portmanteaux in front of
them.
They were going, according to a second plan
Philip had made with his mother, to meet the
contingency of Mary, being loyal, straight to
Mrs. Bright?s until Felise should return.
Mary herself was filled with a new and in-
creasing nervousness, at the rain or the town, or
226


this their unusual position, and she clung tightly
to Philip?s arm now that they two were together
quite alone at last.
Philip rather enjoyed his sensations. It was
pleasant to consider her absolute dependence on
him, to have her nestling to his side in this
childish, half-frightened way. Her complete
ignorance of the world was gratifying in the
extreme. He remembered afresh the seas he
had crossed, the cities he had seen, the men he
had known.
And he felt more of a man than he had ever
felt before.
? I would give anything to be safely at home
again,? she said in a half-whisper.
He tried to soothe her, and to tell her that
home to them would henceforth mean wherever
they two should pitch their tent. Meanwhile, it
was as much in this cab as anywhere else, as
they and their belongings were there.
But she grew rather pettish over it, not having
the home-making instinct very strong in her them
? I would give anything to be at home ,? she
said again, with a lingering emphasis on the last
word. ,
He tried to convince her that runaway
marriages had been in the world ever since men
and women had.
? But it?s so wet! ? she said. ? I won?t be
married in the rain.?
? It will have cleared up by to-morrow.?
It might not,? she said, and he caught an
accent of hope in her voice.


He looked down at tlie little tear-stained face
so near his shoulder and sighed.
For this large thing that he was going to do,
and did not know how to go about, wanted
both nerve and heart.
At his sigh she raised her head.
? Why, what a hoy you look ! ? she said.
? I?ll be twenty-one in nine months, dear,? he
said patiently, but he felt her taunt.
? I used to think husbands always wore beards.
Husbands ! Fancy you a husband! ?
She drew further away to look at him.
? And my husband ! ? She giggled a little
over the strangeness of it.
? Don?t think of it now,? he begged. ? You?re
tired. We?ve travelled more than two hundred
miles.?
?My husband ! c My dear ? I shall have to
call you. ?My dear ? like this.? She put her
lips primly together, then suddenly covered up
her face and began to cry.
And she was very much astonished at herself,
for she had not thought she was going to cry.
He tried to draw her into his arms, but she
edged away.
? You always do try to kidnap me, Pip,? she
sobbed.
His face clouded over.
? Why, you came of your own will,? he said.
?No, I didn?t. I think marrying?s very
silly.?
He kept silent, knowing this mood of hers of
old.


? If it even looks like rain I won?t be married,?
she said.
He did not speak.
? Because I hate unlucky things.?
He admired himself a little for keeping down
his rising anger so well. They drove into a
region of many shops and lights.
Presently an exclamation broke from her.
? Why, you?re only twenty ! ? she said.
?We?ve"said that before,? he replied. ?At
any rate, I?m two years older than you.?
? Yes, but ?they can stop the marriage.?
? Don?t talk such utter rubbish. Who would ?
Your grandfather ? Mine ? ?
? Well, it isn?t legal. I won?t be married if
it?s not legal.?
?Don?t! ? he said angrily.
At that her eyes blazed at him.
? I won?t be married at all in a minute,? she said.
? Well, don't?
? Stop the cab, and let me go back.?
?Now, Mary, don?t you think you?re enough
to exasperate any man ? There?s no train home
till Monday night, you know that perfectly.
Now be quiet and don?t talk any more.?
She stared at him speechlessly. Was this her
beseeching lover ?this masterful boy ?
? You will go to Mrs. Bright?s now,? he con-
tinued. ?We will make up some rigmarole?
say you?re invited there by my mother on your
way through Sydney. But for your own good
you?d better marry me now you?ve gone so
far.?


He said it quite coldly, looking out into the
night. The cab was going slower and slower now.
? If I don't marry you,? she said, ? should you
go home again, too ? ?
He laughed sharply.
?Not I,? he said. ? I should go down to
the islands all the same.?
Then the cab stopped, and he flung open one
door. The cabman came round and lifted out
their luggage, and Mary felt her feet upon a city
pavement for the first time in her life.
She followed Philip and the luggage quite
meekly, too wearied almost to care where they
were going. Looming in front of them was a
terrace of high, dark-looking houses. She saw
their portmanteaux placed upon one front step,
and Philip take the door-knocker in his hand and
give a vigorous rat-tat.
o o
Then some one came along the passage, some
one with a slow, shuffling step, a chain was
slipped noisily away, and a key turned.
? Is Mrs. Bright in ? ? asked Philip of a female
personage, whether old or young they could not
see.
? Yes, I think she is,? came the reply.
? Well, will you tell her that Mr. Allars
wishes to see her ? Mention that I come from
Mine. Dupuy.?
At that the door was opened wider.
? Come in, come in,? said the woman. ?I am
Mrs. Bright.?
Then the portmanteaux w r ere brought in, and
the cabman dismissed.


Philip, being nearest to the door, made to close
it, but Mary clutched his arm.
? Numa! ? she whispered.
? What ? Where ?? he asked, startled.
?Numa ?I?m sure ?he was close at the door,
19 I )f
m sure !
Philip sprang outside, peered round the little
garden, ran down to the little gate.
When he came back Mary was waiting on
the doorstep, and Mrs. Bright peering over her
shoulder.
? Nothing 1 moving in all the street but the cab
O O _
going round the corner/? he said.
Then the door was really shut, and a light
procured.
Philip tried to explain their arrival, feeling
awkward, but Mrs. Bright evidently regarded it
as a thing too commonplace for comment.
Only when he inquired for news of his mother
she laughed.
? Mother,? she said, ?mother ! Poor Felise.?
He waited, regarding her gravely.
?She wdll be down by five to-morrow,? she
said. ?At her lodgings, you know ?she doesn?t
live here. She has a flat, bless your life.?
? All to herself ? ? asked Mary, who had read
of American flats.
? Oh, no,? said Mrs. Bright, laughing. ?My
daughter lives with her. She don?t get on with
her pa and me none too well. She?s got too
many notions for an unmarried girl. But she?s
Felise?s slave, I can tell you.?


? Then why can?t we go to your mother?s
flat ? ? asked Mary of Philip.
?Oh dear me ! Oh dear me ! My dear! ?
exclaimed Mrs. Bright. ? What an hidea!
There?s no one lives on the flat but Felise and
Nell. And they?re both away. What an ?ighly
improper suggestion.?
Mary blushed vividly, feeling she had sinned.
? We must be such a nuisance to you,? she
said.
But Mrs. Bright?s eyes kindled, and she looked
the young travellers over curiously.
? Oh, we?re used to that sort of thing,? she
said ; ? several of the company lives here, you
know.?
She pushed open a door on her right and
flashed her candle round the room.
? Two sleeps here, and three in the next room
reg?lar,? she said. ? And the back room?s a bed-
room, but there?s no one for it now.?
Philip fidgeted. He wanted to pick Mary up
and run away with her,
?Of course the company s away now,? con-
tinued Mrs. Bright, ? and I?m here alone. We
?ave our rooms upstairs?it?s privater, a lot.?
She led the way, and they followed two steps
behind, holding hands like children.
At the stair-top they saw in pale gas-light a
room, with some of the attributes of a sitting
and some of a dining-room. And further on
again another staircase.
? I suppose,? said Mrs. Bright, nodding them


into the room, ? you?d like a drop and snack now,
wouldn?t you ? coming off a journey and being
tired. Have you come far ? ?
? Something over two hundred miles,? said
Philip.
And he felt the tremor that ran through
Mary, and knew that her heart had flashed two
hundred miles back to the little cottage in the
midst of the bush.


CHAPTER X
It was more than eleven o?clock ?nearly mid-
night.
Philip had been shown to his bedroom, the
little back unused one on the ground-floor, and
Mary had been lighted to hers on the third.
An hour ago Mrs. Bright had departed attic-
wards on a quest for blankets, and had been fully
three-quarters of an hour away. Then she had
come down with an armful of blankets, sur-
mounted by two ungowned pillows, and she had
flung all on the bed and gone down to the first
floor for sheets and a towel.
And Mary sat on her unmade bed in her
travelling-dress, and let her eyes wander round
the room.
In one corner was a box washstand, with a
small looking-glass hung above it. In another
three chairs hurled together in a decrepit con-
dition. Then came her bed, a large, high, double
one, with an appearance of ancestry about it.
Three walls were absolutely bare, but half of the
fourth was covered with clothing, and most of it
male attire and dark.
She could not repress a shiver of repulsion
234


and presentiment. There was something un-
canny about everything; and the rain was on
the roof, and beating harshly against one small
side window, and falling deafeningly upon the
iron roof of the balcony just under her large
window.
And she had always hated that moaning of
the wind down a chimney.
She left the bed and walked round the room,
humming to herself. She went over to the chairs
and moved them, looked under the bed, examined
the washstand, and poked each article of clothing
separately.
Then she went back to the bed and sat down,
for she heard a step creaking upon the attic
stairs. Creaking, creaking, but never coming
nearer and never going away.
Mary reminded herself that Mrs. Bright was
down upon the first floor, that Philip was just as
far away, and most probably asleep.
She watched a long time, sitting quite still
with her eyes on the door, and the footsteps
seemed to be coming but never came, and seemed
O
to be going but never went.
At last she heard Mrs. Bright mounting the
stairs with hard breaths, and she ran over to the
door. Her eyes fled half-aflfightedly to the attic
staircase; and she saw there, upon the banister-
railing, a Ion 2 thin hand.
o 7 o
She shuddered, drew back, looked again, and
it was gone.
o
Mrs. Bright came in.
? I had to go and undo one of the beds,? she


said. ? We?ve run out of sheets with this ?orrible
rain putting off the washing.?
She began to make the bed briskly, for all that
she was such a washed-out-looking little woman.
Mary went to one side and took hold of a
sheet corner.
? Aren?t you very tired ? ? she asked.
? La, no! ? said Mrs. Bright. ? I mostly
always stay up till twelve.?
?How many people have you in the house
now ? ?
? Only myself. That?s taking no count of you
and Mr. Allars, of course.?
? But you?ve some one else ? ?
?No. No one will be here till to-morrow,?
? But some one?some one, surely. I saiv
some one.?
The girl?s eyes opened widely.
Mrs. Bright looked at her sharply.
?Now that?s what I call a presentiment,? she
said. ? fancy it?s coming to you, your first
night, too ! It was a creaking, wasn?t it ? ?
? Something certainly did creak.?
?Well, they do say, you know, that this
house is haunted. A man hung himself here
on the rafters in the attic one Friday night at
half-past eleven. And every Friday night?
a little more blanket over ?ere, dear?every
Friday night from half-past eleven till three
in the morning the creaking?s enough to madden
you.?
? Don?t! ? said Mary sharply. ? What a
hateful story! ?


?Yes, ?tisn?t pretty. There?s some as says
you can hear the drip, drip of blood upon the
floor. Mr. Bright?s one of them.?
? A tale like that,? said Mary, ? only makes
me laugh.? .
But she looked very white over it, and her
lips quivered.
? Qh, it gives me the creeps,? said Mrs. Bright.
But she laughed, and dropped a pillow into a
case with cheerful energy.
?Before I go to sleep,? said the girl, ?Im
going to search those attics. Will you come?
? Why, I dursen?t! ?
?But you?ve just been.?
? But that w T as the right side of eleven.
? Well, I will call Mr. Allars.?
? But he?s sleeping somethink beautiful,?
said Mrs. Bright. ? I could hear his breaths as
I passed his door. Just reg lar breaths like a
child.?
?Then I?ll go alone.?
Mrs. Bright looked at her.
? There?s pluck for you ! ? she said.^
Mary walked to the candle, and picked it up
with a trembling hand.
But almost before she could lift it up, it
flickered and went out.
? Now, that?s peculiar,? said Mrs. Bright.
?It would have been if it had stayed in,
said Mary. ? There was no candle left; just a
little bit of wick.?
? But it was a sign. I don?t like it.?
? Have you any more candles ? ?


?I?ll see.?
Mrs. Bright went out, drawing the door to
after her, and darkness and silence reigned.
Mary shivered and stood waiting. And the
creaking came again. It was as if all the ghosts
ot all the haunted houses were tiptoeing up-
stairs. �
At last Mrs. Bright came in, struck a match
in the doorway, and lighted a small piece of
candle.
?Its all there is in the house,? she said,
?and it?s got to serve you getting into bed,
?cause the gas is turned off at the meter. So be
quick.?
Marj snatched it from her hand and sped
upstairs. It was a narrow twisting flight of
stairs, and ended in a perfectly empty room.
It had a leaded floor, a roof window, and a door
at one side.
Mar} almost ran to the door, her face
perfectly white. She threw it open and glanced
round.
There was a bed in a corner, all humped up
vith clothes, boots, and a towel-rail. There was
another box washstand, a box table in the
centre of the floor, and nothing else. No cur-
tains, or hangings, or valences anywhere, and no
other door.
She drew back, ran over the leaded floor
again, and walked quietly downstairs.
? Well ? ? asked Mrs. Bright anxiously,
?No one,? said the girl curtly.
? Its as 1 said. It?s that man suiciding yet.?


? Good-night,? said Mary. ? I?m very tired.?
? Are you afraid ? ?
The girl laughed.
? I should think not! ? she said. She went
over to her portmanteau and opened it.
?I?m used to the loneliest of bush lives,? she
said. ?You see I can protect myself! ? She
held up a small and shining revolver.
? Oh, la ! ? said Mrs. Bright nervously. ?Do
put it away now, do, please.?
? Mr. Allars has one, too,? said Mary quietly.
? If the ghost comes to either of us, I fear he
will have a bad time ! ?
? Well, now,? said Mrs. Bright, ?in case of
any accident I think I had best tell you. It?s
only in a case of emergency it is to be told.
And I think that?s a case,? pointing to the
revolver.
? Well ? ? asked Mary.
? Well, then, there is some one else in the
house. We?ve got a consumptive gentleman
from one of the islands. He?s powerful rich,
and eccentric. He won?t bother you at all, so
do put that awful thing away. And I hadn?t
got to tell nobody about him except a great
emergency came. But that awful thing?s more
than I can stand ! ?
Afterwards, when Mrs. Bright had gone, and
she was quite alone, she smiled, for her revolver
was unloaded, and she had no cartridges with
her.
She sat still on the bed for some time watching
and listening. She heard Mrs. Bright descend


the stairs and slam her bedroom door. An over-
powering sensation of sleepiness came to her, so
that she swayed about with half-shut eyes.
Suddenly, to her dismay, the creaking began
again. Looking through the open door she saw
the thin bony hand upon the banister again,
then a coated arm, then a white face peering
at her.
Her eyes flew open, but she neither moved nor
spoke, feeling completely paralysed. The face
disappeared, and the hand slipped lower. The
creaking came again, then the hand touched her
door, leaned upon it, and a thin white face stared
at her from the doorway.
She could not speak, but she met the man?s
eyes bravely, and no cry left her lips.
After all, it was a pitiful face she was looking
into, refined, sharpened by disease and pain. The
mouth was hidden by beard and moustache, but
the eyes besought her most passionately. She
shivered perceptibly.
?Now, don?t cry,? he begged, childishly
almost.
? I?m not going to,? said Mary tremulously.
Her hand fled behind her, and she brought out
her revolver.
? What for ? ? he asked.
? To protect myself.?
He laughed a little.
? Protect yourself from me f ? he said slowly.
? Why, I wouldn?t hurt a hair of your head.?
? Then what do you want ? ?
He drew back.


? I only wanted to look at you,? he said.
? That is all, just to look at you and go away
again. That is all, before God.?
His face went, then his hand. She heard the
creaking on the stairs again, saw the hand on the
banister. Then silence again.
She was not afraid at all now. His solemn,
earnest assurance had gone to her heart. She
believed the words he had spoken, that he would
not harm her, and felt comforted.
But she locked the door, and barricaded it
with the broken chairs.
And her candle guttered to its death, so that
she had to undress in the dark.


CHAPTER XI
In the morning Mary had a white face and
dark shadows round her eyes.
Her hand shook when she poured out the
coffee, and her lip trembled when she smiled.
She and Philip had the breakfast-table to
themselves. She poured out, and Philip cut the
bread. There was no carving to be done, the
breakfast consisting of boiled eggs, oily butter,
stale bread, a dish of over-ripe bananas, and
coffee ?? boarding-house coffee like the quality
of mercy.?
? X feel I ought to send you to bed again,
Philip said, watching her.
But she shook her head vehemently.
? Take me away from here,? she said.
� I will, to-night, if my mother comes,? he
said ; ? but if she doesn?t ?
? I will die before I sleep another night under
this roof,? said Mary.
She was much more afraid of her mysterious
visitor this morning than she had been last night.
But his assurance that he would not harm her
still rang in her heart, and she could not forget
the concentrated look of misery and suffering


that his eyes had held. She told Philip about
him, with her face suing, though she knew it
not, for the stranger, and he heard her, perplexed
and angry.
? He was coming to your room,? he said.
Mary shook her head. ? Only passing by,? she
replied.
? Well, who spoke first ? ?
Mary thought she had done.
She had to beg.very hard and use all her
powers of persuasion to keep him from exploring
the attic.
He gave in ungraciously,
? I will take you to my mother?s and come
back,? he said.
? H your mother shouldn?t come,? began
Mary.
He looked gloomy.
A silence fell in.
? Let us go to an hotel and be comfortable and
safe,? she said at last.
?It would never do,? he said, staring at her.
? Never ! Never ! ?
? Now, why not ? ? she demanded.
Philip buttered her a chippy piece of toast,
and tried to cut it into fingers.
?It would not be proper,? he said. ? I am
neither your father, nor your brother, nor vour
husband.? y
She reddened a little, and stared into her cup.
? We could go anywhere together if we were
married ? ? she asked.
?Anywhere,? he said, his eyes shining. ?A


married woman?s a sort of goddess. She can go
anywhere and do anything.?
?Would you go straight to an hotel, then ?till
your mother comes ? ?
? Straight! ? he said quickly.
She sighed restfully. ?Then let us do it,
Pip,? she said, looking into his eyes with her
clear frank smile. ? Let us do it at once.
He pushed his breakfast aside, and went round
the table to her.
?Do you mean that, little girl \ he asked.
She nodded, and put her arms round his neck.
? I feel lost, Pip,? she whispered.
He stroked her head gently and straightened
her curls.
? I feel as if you are ? home,? ? she added.
At her exceeding and unexpected graciousness
he gulped down a something in his throat,
and told her stumblingly that she was ? home
for him, too. And they rubbed their faces to-
gether and drew closer, while their tea and the
toast and eggs grew cold.
Then afterwards Mary slipped on her sailor
hat, and Philip his straw one, and they searched
the house over, as far as they might, for Mrs.
Bright; and they called to her, but no reply
came to them.
? Gadding over the back fence, said Philip.
? Sugaring my old gentlemans tea, said
Mary.
She stood listening at the stair-foot.
?We won?t wait,? said Philip impatiently.
? Come along.?


So they walked down the street together, on
their road to matrimony.
But of the ? how-to-be-married ? they were
both as ignorant as the veriest school-children.
In Mary?s mind there was an idea that all
knowledge pertaining even to the matrimonial
ceremony was born in every man, and, therefore,
she did not even think about it now.
And Philip was ashamed of his own ignorance,
and filled with a burning desire to hide it.
? The wedding-ring is the first thing,? he said,
as they walked down the street. ? We?ve to find
a jeweller. We?ll take a cab into town.?
But no cab came, and the morning was fresh
and fair, so they quitted Elizabeth Street and
walked into a region of larger shops.
And the ring-buying was simpleness itself.
When they lett the shop, Philip had the small
sign of the yoke under which they were so eager
to place themselves in a tissue-paper parcel in
his waistcoat-pocket.
? h T ow we must get a Prayer-book,? he said,
? for I?m absurdly ignorant of the service.?
And born in his mind was an idea that the
service of Holy Matrimony was known by every
Christian woman under the sun.
? And I hardly know a word,? said Mary.
? Good Lord ! ? he said, and looked down at
her little white face. ? What a couple we are.
Never mind, we?ll get two Prayer-books.?
But Mary stopped short.
I saw Numa again,? she said. ? I?m certain
I did ; he was standing near that music shop.?


Philip whisked her round.
?Then we won?t walk into his arms,? he said.
? Pound here ?this way ?down here. Now we?re
right.?
?It couldn?t have been, could it ? ? she
asked.
He looked anxious.
? I don?t see why it should have been,? he said;
? do you ? ?
Presently, when they had been walking on for
some time, and he had taken many peeps over
his shoulder, he said ?
? I suppose now, like most girls, you have a
favourite church ? ?
Which showed how disturbed he was.
She spoke a little sharply.
? Now, have I ever been to Sydney before ? ?
she demanded.
? I forgot,? he said. ? Well, we?ll walk on and
take the first that comes. And we can get
Prayer-books there.?
? I don?t pretend to know,? she said presently;
? but haven?t we to be given away ? ?
Then he spoke sharply.
? That?s all gone out of date now,? he said.
O
? Hardly any one is given away.
? Well, it only just struck me. What are
bridesmaids and best men for ? ?
? I think I see a church,? said Philip.
Mary strained her eyes. ? I think so, too,?
she said.
They both walked on, silently and anxiously.
? After all,? said Philip, ? it?s a very simple


thing, being married. A few words and prayers
and a sermon, and you?re my wife.?
?It isn?t a church, after all,? said Mary, in a
relieved tone.
? Neither it is. Some sort of an institution.
Never mind, there?s bound to be one before long.?
They turned into another street, and there,
just in front of them, were two churches.
Mary caught her breath swiftly.
? You look tired,? said Philip. ? Would you
like to go somewhere and rest first 1 ?
But she shook her head.
? No. Let?s get it over and done with,? she
said.
He led her round to a side door away from the
street.
?You shall wait here,? he said, ?while I slip
into the parsonage and fetch the clergyman, little
darling.?
He strode away, gulping something down in
his throat. She looked pathetically small and
pale this morning, and her eyes were shadowy
and her lips trembling.
At the parsonage, left to wait in a room, half
study, half sitting-room, he paced rapidly up and
down. Until that moment he had not suspected
the terribly agitated state he himself was in.
Presently a benevolent-looking old gentleman
with blue eyes and wdiite hair came in.
Philip made known his errand with his head
very high, and his fingers bending his hat rest-
lessly about.
And the old gentleman looked him through


and through, and he smiled faintly. Also he
shook his head.
? Excuse me,? he said, ? but you are not of
age, I think ? ?
? Going on for twenty-two,? replied Philip
dauntlessly.
? And the lady ? ?
? The same,? said the boy, his face whitening.
? Yes. Your names ? ?
�� Philip Allars, and hers Mary Wharton.?
The old gentleman?s eyes kindled.
? I thought so,? he said ; ?just wait a minute.?
He went to a table, rumbled about among
some loose papers, and presently returned with a
newspaper.
? Read that,? he said, his finger pointing.
And Philip read.
It was a caution to clergymen, and gave a
description of himself and Mary, and warned
any one against marrying them, as they were
under age.
At that terrible indignity a wave of red rushed
into the boy?s face, and went away leaving it
greyey-white.
And he swore many quite large oaths, and the
clergyman listened and reproved not.
Only when Philip had gone he slipped into a
side room that overlooked the church and peeped
through the lace curtains.
And he saw them, the boy and the girl,
and the anxious young faces under the straw
hats.
They stood under the porch for a long time,


and the boy took something out of his pocket
and stood looking at it.
The blue-eyed old gentleman knew quite well
it was the ring.
The girl did not look at it once. She
seemed to be thinking very hard for a moment
or two, then she caught sight of the boy?s despair,
went closer to him, and held up her lips.
The porch was quite like a private room.
? A sweet little face she has,? said the old
gentleman behind the curtains ; ? but neither of
them look more than eighteen. Pair of babies !?
?We must clear out of Sydney,? said Philip.
? We?ll be considered good jokes by people.?
? A description of us ! ? said Mary. ? Then if
we go back together every one will know us.
They?ll know we?ve been trying to get married
and can?t.?
? Let them,? said Philip gloomily. ? We?ll go
somewhere very quiet for to-day, and to-night
we?ll go to my mother?s. We?ll be married next
week in the islands. Come along.?
They left the churchyard quickly.
? Gone to try another church,? said the old
gentleman behind the curtains.
But they went to Coogee, and there were very
few people there. And of the few that were, not
many of them noticed the white-faced girl who
was reading a paper novelette so industriously,
or the gloomy-eyed youth with a newspaper.
ihey lunched off penny buns, oranges, and
lemonade. Their wedding-day breakfast?with
the wedding left out.


And when the dusk was creeping over the
sea, and all the little sand-digging, wave-wading
children had gone away, and the rocks were grow-
ing chill and cold, and the last edge of the crimson
o' o
sun sinking into the water, when this happened,
Philip hailed a hansom, and they both got in
and were driven home. To their new home,
which meant Felise?s flat.
Mary?s American impression of a flat paled
when they stopped before a small two-storey
terrace house, with a light burning in upper
window only. And it faded away altogether
when they went up a narrow uncarpeted flight
of stairs into a small uncarpeted room, sparsely
furnished.
Downstairs on the pavement she had clung to
Philip.
? Oh, I wish we were married,? she had cried.
? I don?t like other people at all.? For she was
suddenly afraid of her unknown hostess.
? I wish to God we were,? Philip had said
back to her in the darkness.
Now they were upstairs in the sitting-room of
the flat, and a sweet-eyed, sweet-voiced woman
was coming towards them.
? Cest Marie,? she said. ? C?est Venfant
Marie. And not a bit of her mother about her.?
She kissed the hot sunburnt cheeks, and the
trembling lips. ? I love you already, you pretty
child,? she said. ? See how quick a thing my
love is! ?
At that Philip kissed his mother on the cheek.
And Mary?s heart gave a throb, and it seemed to


her afterwards that a new love was born in her
then. Any one so beautiful as this beautiful
mother of Philip?s she had never conceived.
Felise stroked her hand.
?Is it that you are bride and bridegroom ? ?
she asked. ?We have the cake, Elbe and I.?
?Damn it!? said Philip. ?Oh, damn those
old men! ?
He told the story of the spoilt wadding.
?It is a sharneV? said Felise. ?A burning,
burning shame ! And you so young. Oh,
cruel! cruel! ?


CHAPTER XII
Late that night Philip returned to relieve
Mrs. Bright of the care of the two portmanteaux.
He was going to take up his own quarters in an
hotel ?Felise?s hat not being sufficiently elastic
to receive more than one visitor.
He was too disappointed at the way things
had fallen out to be angry now, but he was
determined to have an explanation from Mrs.
Bright concerning Mary?s mysterious nocturnal
visitor.
But as it happened he never demanded the
explanation at all.
His sharp knock upon the front door was
answered by a thin Jewish-looking man in an
overcoat. He had a black hat stuck at the back
of his head and a black pipe between his lips.
Seeing Philip, he threw the door open with a
flourish, and waved one hand in a gesture that
said what the renowned spider is reported to
have spoken ?? Won?t you walk into my
parlour ? ? ?with a persuasive accent on the
ivont.
Philip stepped into the hall.


? I have called for a couple of portmanteaux I
left here,? he said, ? and I would like to see Mr.
Bright.?
And had he been the commandant of all the
forces at the Soudan he could hardly have used a
haughtier tone.
? Mr. Philip Allars ? ? asked the man.
? Yes,? said Philip, staring from under raised
eyebrows.
?My name is Bright ?David Bright. Will
you come upstairs ? I have been waiting for you
for hours now.?
? Why ? ? asked Philip, surprised.
?That is private. Your business and mine.
There are several walls with very large ears
around us. This way.?
Once more Philip stood in the deserted dining-
room of the boarding-house. His eyes fled to
the end of the long table where he and Mary had
breakfasted only that very morning.
? Mr. Allars,? began Bright, motioning his
visitor into the chair Mary had used. ? Mr.
Allars, if you knew how intimately I am con-
nected with all your family history you would
hardly feel I was a stranger.?
Philip said ? Und ?er ? in his throat.
Mr. Bright waited a second, then went on.
? I knew your mother?before she ever saw
your father. I always took the same interest in
her as if she had been my younger sister. In
some respects ?beauty, voice, dramatic talent ?
she had the makings of a first-class actress. But
she has no memory ?never had one ?and she?s


self-willed and headstrong. However, this is not
what I meant to say.?
Philip waited, standing, and barely concealing
his impatience.
?I knew her at the time of her marriage,?
continued Bright, ? at the time of your birth,
your sister?s birth and death, and your father?s
supposed death. Am I a stranger ? ?
The man?s eyes glittered. Philip caught the
accent on ? supposed ? and started violently.
?My father?s death ,? he corrected quietly.
? No, you are hardly a stranger.?
? Supposed death! ? repeated the man with
slow emphasis. ? Only supposed. I, like half
the rest of the world, believed one man was
murdered, the other drowned, till a year ago.?
The boy caught his breath?his face greyey-
white. Never once did Bright?s eyes wander
from the young strained face, never once did
they lose their hard, glittering look.
? A year ago,? he continued, ? I found your
father?a wrecked, ruined, desperate man. I
found him down in Melbourne. Just a year ago.
Since then?heavens! ?how is it to be the straw
the drowning man clings to ? Why, boy, I tell
you it is preferable to be the dying man him-
self ! ?
Still Philip did not speak. He only stood
gazing in a stupefied, horrified way as though
Bright were some sort of venomous, wonderful
reptile.
? He has worn my clothes,? continued Bright,
? eaten my food, spent my money.?


He stopped again.
?Itis a black lie ! ? shouted Philip. ? A lie !
A lie ! A lie ! ?
He stood panting, his eyes flashing, his face
quivering, his hand raised threateningly.
Bright shrank backwards.
? You will betray your own father,? he said.
?We may have listeners?keep calm. For God?s
sake ?keep calm.?
Philip snorted.
? Don?t dare take my father?s name upon your
lips again,? he said.
Bright put his head and hands into theatrical
attitudes.
?Then relieve me of his burden from my
shoulders,? he said.
Philip approached him threateningly.
? Then I shall leave the burden to fall,? said
Bright, throwing in his words. ?I can no longer
support it. It is not mine.?
The boy stopped and eyed him again.
? Show me this man,? he said.
?You slept in the same house with him last
night,? said Bright. ?He knew it?though you
did not.?
Then a great trembling seized Philip, and his
face grew white and his voice hoarse.
? Where was he ? ? he asked.
?He was in the gods?you in the pit. He in
the attic?you on the first floor. He might
have spoken to you and touched you and
you would not have known him. Father and
son ! ?


? God ! ? said the boy hoarsely.
Bright moved to the door.
? You can come to him now,? he said. ?He
is trembling at the thought of you. Pull that
door to after you ?do not speak ?tread softly.?


CHAPTER XIII
At the foot of the stairs leading; to the attic
Bright stopped and looked over his shoulder, and
he flashed his candle so that its light fell full on
the boy?s face.
?Go on,? said Philip shortly.
Bright laughed a little. The same laugh that
years and years ago had made Richard Allars
clench his hands and fling- back his head : the
O _ ?
same laugh that even to-day made Felise stamp
and flash her beautiful eyes.
Go on,? said Philip haughtily.
?Your father over again,? said Bright,and led
the way without another look behind him, till
he came to the door inside the first attic room.
Then he fixed his glittering glance upon the
boy again, and pushed open the door.
? A late visitor ! ? he said, throwing tragedy
into his voice. ? A late visitor for you, Mr.
Allars .?
He spoke the name in a whisper, that was
almost a hiss.
Philip?s eyes flew over the room, and he put
out his hand and pushed Bright aside. Then he
strode forward.
257 r


And he at that end of the room, just under
the sloping window, cowered back, advanced, and
cowered back again.
He stood, a thin, stooping figure in grey cloth,
head bent, hands hanging loosely by his side,
shoulders stooping ?stood turned half from, half
to the advancing boy.
So they all stood for one full tense minute.
Then Bright laughed again.
? By Jove ! ? he said, ? I was overlooking the
fact that you had not met before. Mr. Bichard
Allars ?Mr. Philip Allars ; your son/?
But the elder man did not speak. His
shoulders heaved, and he sank back into his
chair and dropped his head down upon the arm he
had flung over the table ?a wooden packing-case.
Philip drew nearer.
?Itis a lie !? he said. ?I do not believe it ?
that you are my father. It is a lie !
? A man would be likely to lie over it,? said
Bright maliciously, ? wouldn?t he ? It is an
enviable sort of position to be in, isn?t it ? that of
a fugitive murderer ? Rather a good thing for
the pair of you, if you can manage to convince
the rest of the world that it is a lie.?
The man at the table uncovered his face. It
was haggard, crossed and furrowed, thin and
marked by suffering. An unkempt grey beard
hid his mouth; his eyes, dark as Philip?s own,
were feverishly bright.
When Philip met the affrighted, half-averted
gaze, he squared his shoulders and looked at
Bright.


? Will you leave us alone ? ? lie asked quite
coldly, but as one prepared to enforce bis wishes
if they were slighted.
The sentence and the hauteur in it showed
Bright how far from being unbelief was the boy?s
belief.
After all, his errand was done ?he had made
the one known to the other, placed the burden
upon the shoulders that should bear it?the
burden and the fear. Thus he reasoned aloud,
and looking at the two, then suddenly turned
and strode away. And he shut the door softly,
and laughed his malicious, anger-stirring laugh
aloud in the other empty room.
Philip heard it, and moved rapidly about the
room ; the elder man heard it, and moved as if to
spring from his seat.
He said something below his breath, and Philip,
looking sharply at him, saw that his eyes were
darning.
? What did you say ? ? asked the boy.
? He is a devil,? came the reply, in a voice of
concentrated passion. ?A devil! A devil! I
would like to take his throat into my hands and
crush it until there was no longer any life in it.
A scoundrel! A devil ! A man-eater ! A
cannibal! ?
Philip recoiled, his eyes horrified. This pas-
sion was revolting, but it shed a light upon the
past which had made this man a fugitive and
wanderer.
If anger like this could flame up now when he
seemed to have only the ashes of life in him,


what could it not have done when life was a
brilliant flame ?
The other caught sight of his face, and grew
calmer.
?He has befriended you,? said the boy
sternly.
? Slipped a halter round my neck and given
me food,? he said. ? Jested with me, holding
Damocles? sword above my head. He found me
in a corner of the world, dragging out my life.
Why, in Heaven?s name, could he not have left
me! ?
For one swift minute the boy?s heart echoed
the question.
? And now he has dragged you into it all,?
continued the elder man. ? I would have
spared you ?before God I would have spared
you, Philip.?
?It is right that I should know,? said the boy
sententiously.
? No ; it is right I should bear my own sin.
I would have done. I swear to you I would
have done, if he had not found me.?
? Does my mother know anything ? ?
? Felise ? Felise know ? ? The face fell forward
for a minute. ?Not a word?not a breath. I
have that much grace in me, that I would shoot
myself sooner than bring fresh sorrow on her.
I have been a curse upon her. I will die if my
life crosses hers again.?
? But she comes here ? ? said Philip.
? Not she ! She hates Bright. Besides, lam
only a night bird.?


? But you run dangers,? said the boy sharply.
?Sydney is small; its people have memories,?
? I knew very few people, and I am altered.
I have even passed Felise so close that her dress
has touched my boots ! ?
? There is no truer woman on God?s earth,?
began Philip. ?We might tell her, and ?
But the other leapt to his feet, his face paled,
and his eyes almost started from his head.
? Tell her ! ? he said. ? Tell her ! YTm give me
up, then ! Tell her, heavens ?
? I will tell no one without your leave,? said
the boy reassuringly.
? Swear it! Swear it! ?
? I would die rather! ? said Philip; but the
words came weakly and stammeringly.
? Die rather ! ?the words of a coward ! Damn
you ! Damn Bright! Damn all men and all
things under the sun ! ?
He was working himself into a tempest of
anger and fear.
Philip put out his hand and grasped his
shoulder firmly.
? Do you want me to tell you,? he said calmly,
? that there is no form of death, no torture, no
agony yet discovered, or known to man, that
could drag a word from me ?no half-word to
betray you ? Is it needful for me to swear to you,
before my God, that I will never forsake you so
long as I live 1 ?
The boy?s eyes held a fire almost holy in its
intensity. His words fell solemnly, as though
he were sending each one from his soul.


The man grew calmer under his touch.
? Betray my father 1 ? said the boy hotly and
fervently.
? Don?t call me father ,? said the other, glanc-
ing nervously round the room.
? What name do you go by ? ? asked the
boy.
?Haughton ?Tom Haughton. I?m a consump-
tive from Madeira.?
And his face was so pallid, his form so bent
and thin, his eyes so strangely luminous, that it
was easy to believe.
Mr. Bright suddenly thrust his head in the
doorway.
? I?m going to lock my doors,? he said.
? Let the boy go now. It?s going on for
twelve.?
? I will stay for to-night,? said Philip coldly.
? I have heard nothing yet.?
? You?ve heard enough to take the confounded
pride out of your voice. However, you may
stay.?
And so Philip for a second time, and from
another?s lips, heard of the tragedy upon the
cliffs. Only this time he heard the cause of it,
and its beginning, and his mother?s sin. And
he heard of the life dragged out under foreign
suns, and some of its humiliation and misery.
And towards morning he slept upon the stretcher-
bed, watched over by him his lips now named
Haughton.


CHAPTER XIY
In the morning he went downstairs slowly,
his head bent, his face white, and eyes heavy
from little sleep and carking care.
At the foot of the attic stair-flight he paused,
for there, standing in the doorway of the room
Mary had occupied, with her face turned smil-
ingly towards him, was the little girl he had
kissed in mistake for his mother.
? How is he this morning % ? she asked.
Philip started.
? How is who f ? he demanded.
She nodded upwards.
? You know,? she said ; ? your father.?
The boy paled, and drew closer.
? Oh, you needn?t fear me! ? she continued.
?My father tells me everything. Why, I?ve
been taking care of him?your father.?
? Does your mother know ? ?
Some. She thinks he?s a consumptive from
Madeira. A fugitive prince. La, what a baby
you are ! ?
The boy reddened angrily.
?Now don?t take on!? she said. ?You


know you insulted me the first day. Mother,
indeed ! ?
? I apologised.?
? Well, how old am 1'? ?
He looked at her carefully. Her eyes were
quick and bright, her skin sallow, mouth large,
hair not particularly pretty. She was no beauty.
In fact, she was strikingly plain. But she was
young, unmistakably.
? You?re old enough?to be married,? he said.
And his words were only a sigh for Mary?s failing
in the matter of years.
? Thank you ! ? she said, with a head-toss.
?P?raps I am. How do you know I?m not
married ? ?
? Because you live with my mother, I under-
stand.?
?That?s nothing, your mother?s married!?
She cast her eyes upward toward the attic.
He reddened and made to pass on.
She was darning a black sock, and she did not
stop her stitching, but put out one foot to block
his progress.
? YTm?ve not said how old I am,? she said.
? Twenty-two, perhaps.?
? Eighteen ! ? she said.
? Good gracious ! ? he exclaimed. ? Why,
you?re as young as Mary ! ?
?You wouldn?t have thought it, would
you ? ?
? N?no.?
? Thank you! ? with another head-toss.
?You?re polished, you are!?


? Well, I?ll be hanged if I would, there ! If
you want a lie, I thought you were ten!?
She drew back towards the room.
? I like you in a rage,? she said.
? But I?m not in one.?
? Oh, no 1 Oh, not at all! By the way, your
father wants blankets and port wine.?
? Good hfeavens ! ? exclaimed Philip.
She kept her eyes on her work.
?He wants much,? she said. ? But he won?t
want long.?
Neither spoke for a minute. Then she went
on ?
? If you get him the port wine, give it to me.
I?ll undertake it goes down the right throat. A
chicken wouldn?t be amiss.?
? He shall have it ?he shall have everything,?
said the boy quickly.
? And I?m to cook and bottlewash for
him ? ?
? Will you ? ? earnestly.
?Well, didn?t I say it? How we do pick at
one another! ?
He came nearer and took her hand. It was a
smaller, thinner hand than Mary?s, and very
rough and red.
?Thank you,? he said warmly. ?Thank
you, Miss Bright. I will order the things
now.?
He went downstairs and she watched him.
When the hall door slammed she began to
giggle. She swayed about in the doorway
laughing.


? ? Thank yon, Miss Bright,? ? she said.
? ? You?re old enough to be married, you are !
If you want a lie, you?re ten ! ? Oh, la ! what
a pretty boy he is in a rage ! * Thank you,
Miss Bright,? he says, ? thank you ?! ?


CHAPTER XV
It did not take one long to become acquainted
with Felise?s flat, for it only consisted of two
rooms ?bedroom and sitting-room.
Upon the night of her arrival Mary was intro-
duced to the bedroom and her share of a bed.
?Elbe has the folding-bed in the corner,?
Felise had said, pointing to a bed, small and
retiring as a spring violet. ? You will sleep with
me. Pretty child, if I could I would give you a
bed fit for a Sybarite. Alas ! this half of a bed
designed for one only is all I can offer.?
?But I will like to sleep with you,? Mary had
replied, and felt her words were uncouth, after
Felise?s winning ones.
?It is the widow?s mite,? said Felise, looking
down to the place where she nightly laid a weary
head. ? But Philip is going to take us away
from here to one of those southern islands,
where we will live like queens, and find the
kernel of enjoyment in Life?s nut.?
And Ellie, who was also Nellie, and Miss
Bright, had cast an envious glance at these two,
the beautiful mother and the fresh-faced bride-


elect of one she already regarded as an island
prince.
But the days dropped away, seven of them,
and Philip volunteered no more than one
strangled wish to sail from Sydney.
And Felise, whose theatre duties could not be
resigned for twelve times seven days, dwelt
dotingly upon life in the South Seas; and she
collected ribbons and laces, and bought a new
travelling-trunk,
O
And Mary, who had refused her grandfather?s
and Philip?s grandfather?s commands to return
home?Mary joined a circulating library, and
devoured any book on island life that came in
her way.
But Elbe, who was still Miss Bright to Mary,
as Mary was Miss Wharton to her, Elbe dropped
her mouth corners and pressed her thin lips
together and said ?
O
? Nous verrons! Nous verrons /? quite thirty
times a day.
Which annoyed Mary almost past endurance.
There were many other annoying things. It
annoyed her that Philip, out of all the boarding-
houses and hotels in Sydney, should choose for
his abode the house of Elbe?s father. It annoyed
her that for three of the last seven days that had
dropped into her life he had kept away from
even seeing her. That never by any chance now
had they an hour together alone, and yet Elbe,
from her own showing, enjoyed Philip?s company
almost ad libitum.
It annoyed her that Elbe Bright wore curl-


papers to breakfast and lunch, that Felise made
three washings-up of crockery serve in a week,
and that neither of them were above borrowing
sugar and spice from the family below-stairs.
Then the beginning of another seven days
came, and the feeling of annoyance changed
into one as different as are sharp knife-stabs
from mosquito-bites.
And she never named it jealousy.
There is some soul of goodness in this green-
eyed monstrosity, and lovers all over the world
have cause frequently to bless the sharpness of
its wounding. Some without jealousy would
never love ; many without jealousy would never
know they loved.
It is a refiner of love as much as spoiler of
love?s beauty.
It purges away indifference, and comes as
Cupid?s kiss, arousing one from the dolce far
niente of blissful security. Moreover, it is an
excellent tonic, and nerves the heart and arm for
scenes and deeds from which happy love would
shrink back affrighted.
A little jealousy taken in spasms is a very fine
thing indeed, so that neither the heart nor hand
nor mind stoop to meanness nor transcend to sin.
But from jealousy as a companion in arms, a
fidus Achates, a green-eyed chronic dyspeptic,
may the children of man be delivered as from
battle, murder, sudden death, and small-pox.
And all this to excuse Mary?s spasmodic
jealousy.
It forced that bud of love in her heart into a


warm, red flower in seven days. It did what
years and years of ordinary, uneventful life
might never have done. It sent the red up to
her very forehead if a footstep sounding like
Philip?s came along the street; if his hand
touched hers, his tongue spoke her name, his
eyes rested lingeringly on her. And she forgot
to think what heroines did or did not say or
suffer in books. Herself unto herself was all-
absorbing, and the life of Philip, as it crossed or
touched her life, more stirring than the finest
novel she had yet read.
When his step sounded in the hall, on a day
which was the third of the second seven, the
colour ran even to the roots of her hair, and then
away again, leaving her pale even to the lips
?pale as an Easter lily or a snowdrop, or any-
thing that is purely pale. And her lips trembled
and her hands shook as she stood, hesitating
whether to run away and hide or stay and meet
him.
For three mornings, noons, and nights had
she expected him, and now he was here. And
she was alone.
At the up-country cottage when he had come
home she had lain aside her book perfunctorily,
and had given a perfunctory smile of welcome.
And her smile had almost driven him wild.
To-day she snatched up her work, which
happened to be a blouse for herself, and busied
her fingers upon it. And she hardly smiled at
all?just a slight parting of lips that wanted to
tremble.


And that stabbed more than her smile had
done in the old days.
? I thought no one was here,? he said, putting
his hat down upon a little table that held books,
a pair of slippers, a hat, and a dressing-gown.
? Urn here,? she said.
? So I see,? he said.
He laughed a little and flung himself tiredly
into the only easy-chair the room possessed.
Two minutes fled away, during which Mary?s
heart burned and grew cold over the indifference
of his greeting. Then she stole a look at him?
he was not even glancing at her. One fortnight
ago she could hardly raise her eyes to his without
surprising a covert or open look of love.
And the looks of love ?are they not indescrib-
ably more thrilling and heart-satisfying than the
words ?
? These last few days I?ve been very busy,? he
said, feeling he owed her some explanation.
She nodded and turned a cold little face
towards him. ?So have we,? she said, and tried
to make her voice sound just as usual.
In her heart was a woman?s pride, greater than
her love or jealousy.
It would have carried her laughing and cold-
eyed through the valley of the shadow of neglect,
careless and proud-hearted to the very throne of
indifference.
Stoop to exact what was due to her ?to up-
braid, reproach ! As soon would she have asked
for his love. And how could she give him up,
set him free, because he had been away for three


days and was cold to-day ? She began to reason
with herself about it, and all the while a very
numbness of pain lay round her heart.
? Where did you get to on Sunday afternoon??
he asked suddenly.
? Why ? Did you come here ? ? with a little
quicker feeling at her heart.
?No. Only?Ell?Miss Bright said you went
out.?
She threw back her head. ? Your mother
took me to South Head,? she said coldly. ? I
have never seen the ocean, you know. She
showed me the place where ? She stopped
suddenly.
? Go on,? said Philip, sitting upright.
? Where ?our fathers?yours and mine ?
?I know,? he said, ?I know; I went out the
day before.?
?Didn?t it make you feel miserable?? she
asked, her voice breaking.
7 O
? I swore all the way home,? he said sharply.
Click, click, went her scissors.
? It?s no good swearing,? she said tritely.
? I know,? he said; ? but isn?t it damnable that
one man should be able to ruin so many lives ?
Isn?t it damnable that one man in three minutes
can mar the lives of half-a-score of people for
three or more generations ? ?
She looked at him again. There were lines on
his forehead, his mouth was hard, his eyes blazed,
his face was white and tired.
? You used not to feel it so much,? she said.
? I know,? he answered, ? I know. Every day


the curse of it presses harder. Think of it.
My father has murdered your father or your
father has murdered my father. Imagine Cain?s
son marrying Abel?s daughter. It would have
made their descendants shudder for generations.?
Mary?s face quivered. ?We ought to hate
each other,? she said, ?you think.?
He looked at her. At the fresh flower-like
face paling, at the eager grey eyes beseeching.
? Who says w r e ought to do this \ ? she
asked.
He sighed. ? Doesn?t your owm heart ? ?your
own instincts ??every principle in you ? ?
She caught her breath in a sob.
? Oh, Philip ?hate you f ?
? Yes,? he said fiercely. ? Look at it from my
point of view first. My father murdered your
father.?
? YYs,? she said, and pressed her hands
together.
? Murdered him. Made you fatherless.
Wrecked your mother?s life.?
His eyes blazed at her.
? Yes, I know,? she said.
?And?my God ! You must hate me! Y r ou
must, I say ! ?
Her lips trembled.
? I can?t, Pip,? she said brokenly.
?You ought to want to see my father hanged.
To hunt him down. To hate me.?
? Oh, I can?t, I can?t,? she said, and covered
her face with both hands.
The next second he was at her side.


?My little love,? he whispered, and his voice
was breaking and tender.
Her bosom rose and fell. Hate him ! Hate
him ! And her heart was swelling with a greater
love for him each day.
He slipped one arm round her waist and
drew her head to his shoulder, kneeling by her
side.
? Hate you! ? she echoed.
And he pressed his lips to that little piece of
her cheek not hidden in his coat.
?For God?s sake don?t! ? he said.
?But if?my father ? she began.
But he kissed her over and over.
? Oh, you little saint, you,? he whispered.
? Love me ?love me ?for God?s sake love me.?
But he had reached that point of civilisation
that counts the disgrace of the father, the shame
of the child, and meeting her clear, loving gaze,
his own fell. Even his clasp around her loosened.
? I have been thinking lately?of going home
?again,? she began. Which was almost untrue,
as she had only thought once that she could
never go back again.
But it gave him an opening for alluding to the
sugar plantation and a South Sea life.
? Have you ? ? he said.
She drew a little further away.
? I could never go down to the islands,? she
said. But she would have slipped on her hat
and gone that afternoon.
He sighed.
? Why not ? ? he asked.


And she had expected him to call Heaven or
earth to witness that she should.
? It is?it must be very hot there,? she said,
? and it?s so far.?
He stood up.
?And that is true,? he said.
? So I thought I would go home.?
? When people speak of far and near,? he said,
looking down at her, ? they measure from home.?
? Well ? ?,
? Well! we allowed we were home for each
other. How could the South Seas be far ? ?
Then her heart spoke.
? It would be the nearest spot on earth,? she
said, and her face paled at her own boldness.
?Nearer than here?? he asked, his lips on
her hair and his breath coming fast.
She nodded, words failing her.
Surely now he would [say, ? Let us go; let
us away! ? in his old impassioned way.
?We must make here nearer than there,? he
said, ? or be content for it to be further ; for we
cannot go.?
She asked, ? Why not ? ? sitting bolt upright.
? I have other plans. I am trying to get a
partnership; my money is running out.?
He spoke hesitatingly, his eyes turned from
her.
?If I went home, should you come?? she
asked.
? N?no.?
Footsteps sounded upon the stairs; Elbe
Bright?s voice singing came to them.


<e If I asked you to leave the Bright?s,? asked
Mary quickly, ? would you ? ?
? How absurd ! ?
? But would you?will you ? ?
? N?no.?
? Oh, goodness me ! ? said Miss Bright, making
a noisy entrance. ? There?s a blessed southerly
blowing. How Ido hate southerlies! Oh,
goodness me, Mr. Philip ! ?
Mary writhed inwardly at the �� Mr. Philip ? ;
the �� Mr.? was so much �� thrown in.?
He looked nervously at Mary.
? You?re not going to stay for tea to-night,?
said Miss Bright, ?so I?m going to ask you
to carry something for me.?
Not going to stay for tea; yet Felise was
mistress of the house, and he her son !
Mary?s spirit rose, spurred by his last kiss.
? How do you know that ? ? she asked of the
little sallow-faced girl.
Miss Bright laughed. Mary waited with up-
turned face and eager eyes for Philip to assert
he was going to stay for tea, and stay for ever,
if they two chose it so?he and Mary.
He certainly did say, ? I think I shall stay
awhile longer,? but he said it most evidently
of necessity and because of Mary?s eyes. The
set of Miss Bright?s lips said, ? Nous verrons!
Nous verrons ! ? But the words she spoke were?
�� I really came here for some soft muslin
?Felise has some?the identical thing for
poultices.?
? Oh,? said Philip.


?We have an invalid at home,? continued
Miss Bright; ? and he is evidently going in for
pneumonia or pleurisy. I am the nurse the
ministering angel.?
She found some muslin from a tin box under
the window, and she made a roll of it and some
newspaper.
? Will you carry it for me 1 ? she asked,
passing it over to Philip. Then she went over
to the door. ? I have hardly time to breathe,?
she added ; ? the case is urgent.?
Still the boy hesitated, his eyes imploring
Mary.
? I am sure,? she said, in an even steady
voice, ? you are not going to be so ungallant as
to refuse to go.?
?No,? he said ; ?of course not.?
Yet the parcel was very small; and she would
have thought his refusal the flower of chivalry.


CHAPTER XVI
That night Mary tried to arrange her life
into pigeon-hole neatness. Each hour bracketed,
accounted for, each thought orderly as the
sprucest of garden beds; all dream-life folded
up and laid away.
She determined to live and act only in the
very present; and to be patient over Philip,
for she felt vaguely that he was passing through
some sort of an ordeal just now, and in her
heart she had no doubt but that he loved her
still.
She bracketed the morning hours?cleaning,
cooking, mending ; the afternoon?sewing, read-
ing, painting.
And those sweet still hours at the edge of
the day she designed for Philip. She thought
she would tell him that, and let him label them
his, himself.
So she commenced her self-ordered life with
a chapter from Thomas a Kempis on ? The
Exercises of a Good and Religious Person,? and
she prayed the prayer written there?
? Help me, my God, in this my good purpose,
and in Thy holy service ; and grant that I may
278


now this day begin perfectly, for that which I
have done hitherto is nothing.?
When she rose from her knees her lips were
meek, her eyes as two lambent stars, or the
eyes of doves, or the deep grey of a still lake.
She looked down at Febse?s sleep-stricken
face ?beautiful but haggard, and with innumer-
able little fine lines upon it; and she felt a
great love for her beating and bursting in her
heart, so that she could hardly refrain from
stooping and kissing her.
She tip-toed away. The other small bed was
unpressed, Elbe not having returned last night.
She even felt kind to the bed, although the
pillow looked at her with a glance that said,
? Nous verrons! Nous verrons /? Then she
closed the door, and went into the other
room.
And she brushed and dusted and tidied like
the busiest, happiest, most important little house-
wife in the world, singing in a low voice and
smiling over the very dirtiest corners.
She made some delicious coffee, and burnt
her face over the toast, which when made and
buttered and trimmed, looked the toast of a
lady, which Elbe?s never did.
And she set a tray with a white pocket-hand-
kerchief because here serviettes w T ere not any
more than they were at the cottage ?and placed
upon it a rosy-faced apple, banana, toast, and
coffee.
Then she went in and aroused Febse,
? Breakfast is ready,? she said, and she stood


by the bedside smiling, blithe and fresh and
sweet as the morning.
? Oh,? said Felise, yawning.
? Lie still and I?ll bring you a basin to wash
your hands and face in?don?t move.?
?Oh,? said Felise with another yawn, ?I could
have slept for another hour. Why for did you
wake me ??
But she washed herself, smoothed her hair,
and began her breakfast.
? Pretty child ! ? she said, after a drink of
stimulating coffee. ?So thoughtful and kind.
You will make me into a bone-idler and wear
your beautiful soft flesh into skin just covering
your bones.?
Mary laughed.
?If I go out marketing,? she said, ? will it
make the bones poke through ? I want to roast
and boil and bake and stew to-day.?
But Felise had not listened. She was watch-
ing her with beautiful grave eyes.
? You love me, pretty child ? ? she asked.
Mary protested her love in sentiments warmer
than any Philip had had from her.
Felise listened gravely.
?But,? she persisted, ?do you love me for
Philip?s sake or my own ? ?
? Your own ! Your own entirely ! Why, I?d
love you just the same if no one belonged to you.
And I love you more because of Philip.?
Which unreasonable sentence delighted Felise.
? I love you so,? she said, ? that I can forgive
you for taking my boy?s heart and threatening


to make me into a mother-in-law. There is love
for you ! ?
Day was yet young in the Sydney streets when
Mary began her marketing.
She wore a white straw hat with a jaunty
piece of blue ribbon and a plume arranged on it
by Felise?s fingers, a fresh muslin gown, long
suede gloves, and dainty shoes.
And she had a basket in one hand and a purse
in the other. Her mind was as busy over little
domestic details and culinary plans as it could
be.
She lingered at a fresh-looking fish shop and
wondered whether she could manage ? curried
lobster ? or ? oyster patties.?
Then her eye was caught by a string of Aus-
tralia?s little enemies?dead, swinging bunnies ?
and she pondered whether one might be turned
into jugged hare.
She went on, wondering and pondering, and
turned into an arcade still thinking of cooking.
Then came a fruit shop, window and doorway
tempting with luscious fruit. Strawberries,
raspberries, and currants straight from Hobart,
bananas almost speaking of Fiji, rosy tomatoes,
yellow loquats, crinkled passion-fruit, Cape goose-
berries, native currants, and a bewildering variety
of vegetables.
She straightway forgot fish and rabbits, and
thought only of a fruit diet with a course of
vegetables.
Matrimony now showed her a new and vastly
entertaining face. It meant the cooking of


dinners, it meant being queen of a kingdom
infinite and domestic; it meant shopping !
She turned away thinking, thinking, and clasp-
ing her purse and basket close. And the next
time her feet halted she was outside a large
furniture shop.
Now her home-making instincts spoke up.
The doorway was lined either side with chairs,
wooden, cane, and cushioned.
How could she pass by ? She who had never
seen half-a-dozen shops together in her life before,
and who was going to be married ?some day.
She looked at the chairs respectfully and
thoughtfully, then her eyes left them and
wandered into the shop itself. And when they
got there they widened and darkened, and then
hardened till they were steel-grey and not soft,
warm, Irish eyes at all.
For inside the shop, inspecting a beautiful
wide-seated easy-chair, were Elbe Brio-ht and
Philip.
They were both poking it and prodding it, and
a shopman was waiting respectfully on one side.
Then Elbe sat down in it and leaned her head
back and evidently made one of her sharp, saucy
speeches, for she and Philip both laughed and
the shopman smiled.
Mary .turned away and left the window swiftly.
And a wave of such anger as she had never
before felt in her life rose right up to her throat.
No love for Philip was in her heart, no pity
for herself, nothing but a red-hot, surging, beat-
ing, blinding jealousy.


She left the city streets and sought the city?s
wide, green, sleepy-seeming park. And she
walked down the long avenue from the end fac-
ing the church to the end opposite those tall
terrace houses. She walked rapidly, lightly,
past loungers and workers and walkers, and she
wished there were no other people in the world,
because they looked at her and she was so
passionately unhappy ?or was going to be, some
day.
Then she left the avenue and took a sidewalk,
and she wished there that there were hundreds
more people in her life so that all her thoughts
and hopes might not be round this one human
being ?as the clinging ivy might wish some of
its tendrils w T ere around other oaks when the one,
its stay and staff, is hewn down.
Afterwards, long afterwards, when her physical
ache spoke above the ache of her heart, she went
home.
And she mounted the stairs heavily, and
carried an empty basket and untouched purse
into the living-room, as they called it.
And there was Philip sitting on the table and
swinging his legs as he talked to Felise, who was
lounging on a sofa with a novel in her bands.
? I heard yesterday,? Felise was saying, ? that
a man with five or six hundred pounds could
make a fortune on a sugar plantation in Queens-
land.?
Then Mary came in.
All the beautiful morning glow was gone from
her face, her eyes were no longer as the eyes of


the peaceful dove, her lips no longer mild and
meek. And she had quite forgotten about the
exercises for a good and religious person.
Philip rose to greet her, and their hand-clasp
was the briefest of hand-touches.
?She?s been out marketing,? said Felise.
? She is growing matrimonial/Philip, my son.
Did you buy much, pretty child ? ?
/ Yes >? sa M Mary, thinking vaguely of up-
braiding Philip, of running away, of bearing and
hearing in silence at first.
?What did you buy ?? asked Felise. ?I see
cream cheese in your eyes, Marie May.?
? No,? said Mary, and put her empty basket
on the table, ? I didn?t buy anything.?
? Are you tired ? ? asked Philip. Come and
sit down. I won?t offer you my seat.?
Felise sprang up laughing, and picked up a
slender, shabby slipper she had kicked off.
?Oh, you cold, cold ones !? she said. ?You
reserved and self-contained ! Yon icebergs !
Behold, I fade away ! Dissolve ! Disappear !
1 here is the sofa. Leave the table, Pip?Philip.
lam gone?to wish I were Felise the gay once
more, and you?another ! We two would not
have stood a table apart with the looks of the
cold, and the ways of the old ! ?
She ran away laughing and shut the door.
Then the two pairs of young eyes looked at
each other Philip s with their old glow coming
into them, Mary?s warming to a flash.
? Mdiy, how you look ! ? exclaimed Philip
suddenly.


She had not the patience to lead up to it
artistically.
? This is the second time I have seen you
to-day,? she said. ? The first was when you
were buying the arm-chair! ?
He started.
?Well?? he said, but his eyes looked surprised.
? Well, you were not alone ! ?
? Is that why you look at me so, Mary ? ?
? No,? she said, ? I don?t care a bit,?
? Why, in common parlance, you?re jealous ! ?
?You know I?m not,? she said emphatically.
? I don?t care a bit, not a bit I You may buy
arm-chairs all day long, and every day in the
year, I don?t care ! ?
His eyes shone.
? You want me to be a tethered iamb ! ? he said.
?Y T ou can be a rampant lion, for all I care,?
she replied, and she sat down and began to
strum with her fingers on the table.
Suddenly he came round to her, touched her
hair, her cheek, with a caressing hand.
? Mary ! ? he said, and his eyes besought hers.
But she did not see.
? Yes ? ? she asked, in the careless tone of
one already slipping out of a life.
? Mary! ? he said again, and she became
aware of a something new in his voice, then in
his eyes, and she trembled. Something of the
old, something of the new Philip. A passionate
love speaking sufferingly.
? If you are tired of me ? she began, as
proudly as her trembling heart would let her.


But he slipped his arm round her shoulder,
and turned her face backwards to his.
? I?m just hungry for you,? he said whisper-
ingly.
? If you would like to start free ?
? I?m just hungry for you,? he said again, and
fell to kissing her lips and cheeks. There was
an odd tremble in his voice, his hands trembled,
his eyes were tired and passionate as of one who
had been awake all night, and put through the
rack in the morning.
She slipped her arm round his neck, and her
own voice broke.
? You will never go to that house again?the
Brights??? she said, with her lips on his forehead.
Iwo tears fell from her eyes, and lay there
where her caress had fallen.
? I?m a ruffian ! ? he said.
?You will never go a�rain ? ?
O o
She drew back.
? You will never go again ? ? she repeated.
? I must,? he whispered.
She slipped from his embrace.
?You ivill go again?? she asked, her eyes
widening.
? Come back to me, darling.? He drew near
again.
? Why, you will give me up ! ? she said.
? Never?by the holy stars ! ?
? Then you will give her up.?
? I cannot,? he said, his eyes on the floor.
? There is no love between us, I swear.?
? Then what is there ? ?


? A bond that only God can loosen,? he burst
out passionately.
? Oh, Philip! ? she said, and stood upright.
?Oh, Philip, then it is all over?all our love ! ?
?It has hardly begun. Mary?my little saint
?trust me. Trust me. See, I beg it.?
? You never saw her?Miss Bright ?before
we came to Sydney ? ?
? Once,? he said, and meditated should he tell
her of the misplaced kiss ? Seeing her face, he
decided to postpone his confession. ?The day
I went to see my mother at the Poyal ?you
remember,? he added.
? If you cannot give her up, promise not to
have any more to do with her?you can give
me up,? she said in a voice of ice.
? Mary ! ?
She threw back her head petulantly.
? I cannot help it?l am made that way. A
bond that only God can loosen! ?
? A bond that only God can loosen ! ?
?Then I won?t have you ?bound! For all
I know ? she stopped and flushed, and her
eyes fell.
?Well?? he said.
She did not reply, being ashamed of a
thought.
? Well ? ? he demanded. ? Whatever you
were going to say it was something unworthy
of you.?
? For all I know,? she repeated, ? you have?
er ?hissed her.?
And he grew steadily, deeply, guiltily red.


How her eyes widened, and the colour ran away
from even her lips.
? You have!? she exclaimed.
? Listen ? he began.
But she closed her ears with her hands.
? Not another word,? she said, and marched
to the door with her head in the air.
? Listen,? he said, and seized her two elbows,
drawing her hands down. ?I did kiss her, it
is true, but ?
She pushed him away with sudden vigour.
? Not another word ! ? she said. ? I won?t
hear it. I won?t read it if you write it! ?
She ran downstairs.
?It was a mistake,? he called over the
banisters. ?I thought she was my mother.?
And her laugh, tantalising and mocking, made
him want to shake her.
She slammed the front door, and went up the
street at a great speed, then across the park and
into Elizabeth Street.
She watched the trams as they passed and
re-passed her, and wished wildly that she knew
some one in any of the suburbs they were going
to ?that she knew any one else in all Sydney
but just Felise and the Brights.
Then one tram came speeding along with all
its cars empty, and a youth hanging on in a
hazardous manner to the platform. And in a
flash, as it passed her, she saw that the youth?s
eyes were Numa?s eyes, and that the youth?s
smile from ear to ear was Numa?s smile.
She drew back hastily, then pressed forward.


Was not Numa, at least, a home-link, if a broken
one ?
She put up her hand, as she would have done
to hail an omnibus.
Immediately he put up his in imitation. She
thought that meant he was coming to her, so
she walked forward as the tram was stopping
at the next corner.
But he still kept the same position, and
lowered his hand.
Then she waved, and he waved back again,
and took off his hat. And before he put it on
again the tram disappeared from her sight,
hidden by a following one.
A great sense of loneliness settled down upon
her. She hardly knew where to go or what
to do.
Her money, the little that was left from the
quarterly allowance Mr. Allars had seen she
received, amounted to two shillings short of a
pound.
Soon she would have been driven to ask money
from Philip.
But now there was no Philip for her, and she
could no longer live in the house of his mother.
She went back slowly, and climbed heavily up
the stairs once more.
There was no sound above-stairs at all. She
peeped into the bedroom ?no one there ; into
the living room, and?Felise lying on the sofa
once more.
Again, and for the second time that morning,
Mary returned with hat and gloves on.


The remains of a somewhat varied lunch were
yet on the table ?her own empty basket, and a
bundle of old clothes for charitable purposes.
?Have you lunched?? Felise asked. Her
voice was like ice, and she kept her book up
before her face.
Mary looked round sharply.
? No,? she said. ? I forgot all about it.?
Then Felise rose, and began to prepare a space
at the table-cloth for another plate.
?Don?t you trouble,? said Mary, ?I can do it
myself.? This attention from Felise was unusual.
? I prefer it,? said Felise in the same iced
way, ? that my guests should not attend to
themselves. I have no servant, alas ! therefore
I will do my small best.?
?But,? said Mary, ?I got the breakfast only
this very morning.? Her eyes were wide in their
old frank half-childish way.
? What I would permit my future daughter-
in-law to do is one thing ?a guest another,?
replied Felise, her face cold as a graven image?s.
? I have nothing to offer you but cake and coffee,
and brown bread and butter. Alas ! ?
Mary threw back her head.
?Your welcomes vary,? she said.
Felise raised her voice and eyebrows.
?Unfortunately,? she said, ?I cannot veil it.
My heart is always in my welcome.?
?Or out of it,? replied Mary steadily. She
rose and moved over to the door.
? Where are you going ? ? asked Felise, fol-
lowing.


?To collect ray belongings,? said Mary, with
a breath-catch. ? I could not stay here any
longer.?
? You are welcome,? said Felise, ?My hos-
pitality is meagre, but you are welcome.?
?Did you think I would live on Philip?s
mother when I had quarrelled with Philip ? ?
? I did not think at all. I hate all cold-
hearted, cold-blooded unnaturals ! You have
wounded my son to-day?blasted his life?and
he so young ! I will never forgive you.?
? What has he told you ? ?
? You are like your mother. Cold, hard, with
a heart of stone that smites others. You are
like your father, who spoilt my husband?s life
and mine?and Philip?s.?
She began to cry. ? You are like your mother,?
she said again, ? who foretold in her cold, hard
way that my own little girl-child would die.
\ou are like your father, who denounced me to
my husband.?
Mary stood shivering, her face pearly white.
It was not my father ? she began in a
broken voice.
?It was,? said Felise hotly. ?It was. All
the world knows it. Philip docs. Your mother
did.?
Mary looked at her for a tense second. Then
she turned again and fled away down the stairs
and into the streets a^ain.


CHAPTER XVII
Ellie Bright had been thinking a great deal
about life on a sugar plantation. And she had
settled it all in her vain little head that the wife
of a South Sea island prince of a sugar planta-
tion would be a modern Queen of Sheba.
It seemed a waste of life?s opportunities that
Puritanical little Mary ?Mary with the serious
eyes, the simple gown, and the low, insignificant-
sounding voice?should be in such an exalted
position.
It was far more in the fitness of things, she
told herself, that she, who had some sense of
dramatic happenings, should be that queen.
And she liked Philip, liked his frank, boyish
manner, and admired his fresh, healthy face.
After all, as she allowed with a little heart-
stab, life on Felise?s flat and with her irregular
theatre engagements was wearisome, and he to
whom all the heart in her sallow little body was
given every day was less and less likely to climb
up to that yearly income he deemed necessary to
keep them both.
So she went on in a desultory way, playing at
292


the same time serpent in two people?s paradise,
and ministering angel in one sick-room.
There came a day when slie was consoler as well.
Philip w T as very miserable. It was a misery
that hung heavy in his eyes, and made his mouth
melancholy and stern. And it found vent in
strangled sighs and much pacing in the empty
attic. Once or twice she slipped in to him.
The first time she told him that all troubles have
an end, and that those w T ho do not see and suffer
cannot understand.
The second, she put her little yellow hand on
his sleeve and said, ? Some day Mary will find
out the bitter injustice she has done you.? For
she had gathered from Felise, who knew very
little indeed, the wdiy and wherefore of the
quarrel of these fond young lovers.
That was like a tonic to him.
He went back into the sick-room, feeling
angered with Mary and pitying himself. Thrown
aside and condemned because he could not throw
a light over his ways for her to understand the
windings and crooked places.
Cast aside by her for befriending another, and
that other his father.
Cast aside by his grandfather for befriending
another, and that other his mother.
Then he fell into his old way of magnifying,
glorifying, and exaggerating.
His mother was beloved by him tenderly, but
he was not permitted to take his great trouble to
her. He was his father?s friend, but his father
was not his.


Bright he regarded as Mephistopheles in
modern checks?as Shylock bargaining for his
pound of Christian flesh, good measure, pressed
down.
Looking around the horizon of his meditations,
he could see no friend to aid or cheer him.
And that made him feel strong and self-reliant.
He lifted the invalid from the bed to a sofa Elbe
and he had bought, and performed half-a-dozen
of his ordinary sick-room duties with a strength
and set purpose amounting almost to callousness.
Then the ministering Elbe slipped in, and she
shook up the pillows and administered medicine,
and made the room look in five minutes as
though a woman were in it?not a lady, but
Philip was too distressed to notice this nice
distinction.
Then she smiled in his eyes, and said some-
thing about the darkness of the night before
dawn.
He recognised her swiftly as his only friend.
And that was weakening.
TT
He grew very low, and he let her console
him.
He told her that the salt of life had lost its
savour, and she tried briskly to convince him it
was only his disordered palate.
After a day of such consolings the sick man
grew distressed at their intimacy. He turned
peevish, refused his medicine from Elbe, and
sent her from the room; and he insisted on
Philip sitting in that wide-seated easy-chair, so
that he could see him.


? I thought you were engaged to that other
little girl,? he said.
Philip looked gloomy.
? You told me you were as good as married to
her." . , ,
Philip bent his head. Last night he had
kissed her in his sleep, and the misery of the
reality made his heart heavy.
? Are you going to marry her % ?
? I don?t know. No!?
The invalid closed his eyes and pressed his
hand over them. Then he sighed and took down
his hand and examined it.
? It?s confoundedly thin,? he said.
But Philip did not speak; he sat quite still
with the dusk in his eyes and a gathering look of
pain that the dusk could not hide.
? It?s the hand of a skeleton ?a dying?a dead
l f}
man!
Still Philip did not answer.
The sick man sat suddenly upright.
? Dying ! ? he said. ? Death ! Gracious
heavens, boy, don?t you hear what I?m saying ? ?
Philip went over to him and put him back
gently.
?You must keep quiet,? he said. ? A little
excitement like that undoes days of nursing.
But the misery, pain, and fright in the dark
eyes looking up to him took away his nerve.
? Am I dying ? ? panted the invalid.
Philip, who had been whispered only that
morning that the days of his life might be
numbered on one hand, kept silent.


He had no cheering words, no words of
promise?no words at all to say. But he took
the weak, thin hands in his, and his eyes were
eloquent.
The elder man turned his face to the comfort-
able sofa-back, drew away his hands from the
boy, and lay silent.
Perhaps he was trying to weigh his life, to
find out by how much it would be wanting.
Perhaps he was forcing his heart to understand
the ways of death. Perhaps he was only wonder-
ing if he could die unafraid.
It was a long time before he turned round
again. And then Philip was sitting quite close
to him, and the darkness was so thick that he
could not see his face, but he felt his warm,
living, young hand on his shoulder, and some of
the fear went out of his heart.
? I always hated death,? he said haltingly.
Philip pressed his shoulder. After all, gestures
and looks and touches often make a language
more eloquent than any words can. The words
that are left unsaid are often more precious than
if spoken, more strengthening, more invigorating.
?If I am going?to die,? began the weak
voice, and stopped ; then with sudden passion,
? Boy, boy, for God?s sake don?t desert me ?don?t
leave me here alone to face it?to die and lie
dead all alone.?
?I will never leave you,? said Philip steadily.
?Tes, you will; you will go like the rest ?
you will leave me when I tell you all.?
? I will never leave you,? said Philip again.


? Swear it; swear it with your hand in mine.
Swear it before your God.?'
? I swear I will never leave you so long as
you live; never desert you. Before my God I
swear it.?
The dying man gasped.
? Then I wdll write it down,? he said. ? I will
write it down, and you shall read it ?when I am
dead.?
?Face it out,? said Philip, gripping harder.
? It?s like hitting a man in the dark ?a confes-
sion after death. Brave it out now, whatever it
is.?
? I couldn?t. I couldn?t, my lad ; I haven?t
the strength, Philip.?
But Philip roused him.
?Whatever it is, I will stand by you,? he
said. ? I?ve sworn it; but for God?s sake speak
out now ?if you never spoke before.?
? I can?t; I?ve been acting a lie?a black lie.
You shall know the truth some day.?
? Now ! I insist! Does it concern me ? ?
?Yes,? said the dying man, beginning to
whimper. ?It -was all Bright?s doings. Before
God I swear I did not think of it. But he
threatened to give me up if I didn?t do it. I
wish to heaven he had never found me.?
?You would have been in a worse plight.
Go on.?
? I should not. I had a nice little sum made
by. pony-racing. He claimed it. He would
have claimed the boots off my feet, if they would
have fitted him. Curse him ! ?


The curse of a dying man is a terrible thing.
Philip drew back a moment, then came nearer
and bent over the sofa.
? Tell me/? he said insistently.
?He showed me how easy it was. It was
through him I did it. I would never have
thought it.?
Philip drew still nearer. Then the dying man
raised himself, and spoke affrightedly, pleadingly.
And almost at his first words the boy shrank
back amazed, horrified, incredulous.


CHAPTER XVIII
Mary walked about the Sydney streets till
her feet ached. Then she returned to the corner
where Numa had flashed past her on a tram, and
watched all the up-trams in the hope that his
keen curiosity might bring him back again, if
only to look at her.
He would be able to tell her something of the
two old men, she knew, and her heart ached
drearily for the smallest fragment of news.
Again and again did she think with quite a new
tenderness of the little bush cottage and its
unhomeliness that was now so terribly homely.
Her imagination showed her the inartistic
table set for four, with wide-smiling or thunder-
ous-eyed Numa flitting round ; and a lump rose
in her throat, born of her great longing to be
sitting in her own chair opposite to Philip once
more, and no black tragedy or gnawing unhappi-
ness anywhere.
She stood a desolate little figure in muslin,
staring into each returning tram, and longing
unspeakably for that one dark face, that one
home-face, to come past her again.
She sent up the most fervent prayers, standing
299


there amongst the ever-coming, ever-going
people.
And at last it seemed they were heard. A
tram came very slowly along. There was a
slight block on the line, six or eight trams pro-
gressing at funeral pace, and this particular one
almost standing still. And there, in an almost
empty front smoking-car, was Numa. He had a
cigarette in his mouth, and a brown-paper parcel
by his side.
Mary made a frantic gesture to him, but he
only removed his hat with a very low bow.
The next second she had scrambled in, and
was sitting by his side.
? Oh, Numa ! ? she cried, and forgot to offer
up thanks for her answered prayer.
He smiled a little, very stolidly.
?Why didn?t you come to me last time when
I beckoned ? ? she asked.
? Me goin? for ?im,? he said, patting the parcel.
? Where are you going now ? ?
? Take ?im ?long back.?
It seemed unbelievable to her in her strait
now, that she had ever ordered him about?made
him do her bidding.
He gazed out of the tram window, his cigarette
between thumb and finger.
?How nice you look to-day, Numa,? she said,
with a little tremble in her voice.
At that he brought his eyes back slowly to
her face. He was dressed in his best, and
the truth of her words was pleasantly patent to
him.


� It?s a new suit, isn?t it ? ? she asked.
He nodded.
? New ?n Monday, an? new boots an ?at, he
said. , , , . ..
He even removed his hat, and brought it
lower for her to see. It was a sailor, with a blue
band round it.
? You buy them yourself ? ? she asked
He shook his head.
? Massa bought ?em,? he said.
? Massa in town ? ? she ventured.
But he looked out of the window without
replying.
? Numa,? she said, ? I want to see massa.
The tears came into her eyes at the largeness
of her want. n
? You take me to him, and I give you these,
she found several coppers, and jingled them
under his eyes.
He shook his head consideringly.
? And matches,? she said, ? twelve boxes to
yourself.?
He looked doubtful.
??Braid?? she asked,and flashed her eyes at him.
?Me not fraid. Go on, he said.
?If you?re not ?fraid, take me to him. If not
I?ll call a policeman.?
At that his eyes looked thunderous.
? Where m Capten ? ? he asked.
? I don?t know. He?s gone away.?
? Garn ! ?im come back.?
? No, he won?t,? she said.
Her face looked doleful, her eyes tearful.


His eyes rested on her for a few moments,
then he swung himself from the tram, which had
now stopped.
She had to walk sharply to keep him in sight,
and he knew that and chuckled to himself as� he
went.
Presently he came to a large boarding-house
in a wide pleasant-looking street, and he�ran up
the steps and into the hall.
Mary followed without hesitation.
Although she would be one of Australia?s
wealthy heiresses if things fell out as they should,
never yet had she been in such a richly-furnished
hall as this, never yet had her feet pressed such
well-dressed stairs.
Upon the landing Numa knocked with the
back of his hand upon a closed door, and then
immediately turned the handle and entered.
Mary hesitated a second longer, then pressed
forward and peeped into the room.
And never before had she seen such a bed-
room as this. A wardrobe with a plate-glass
door reflected her own white startled face to
her. The dressing-table had a large swing-glass,
the washstand was marble-topped, and a breeze
came in through the wide window and blew beau-
tiful lace curtains lazily in and out.
Then her gaze went to the bed, and she forgot
all else, for lying there with white face and
closed eyes was he to whom she had given such
a frank childish love, Philip?s grandfather, her
ov n protector and friend. She sprang forward
past Numa?s wide smile.


? What is the matter ? ? she burst out; ? oh,
what is the matter ? ? and she forgot every one
else in the world but this one man.
His eyes flew open and he stared at her, at
first with a look of incredulity, but presently
relief crept into it, and a little of the old affection.
? I have been ill,? he said coldly ; ? influ-
enza. I am nearly right again now.?
?Oh,? she said, and gulped down a sob,
because his face was so haggard and his hair so
white.
He raised himself on his elbow.
? Are you come back to me, my girl, as you
left me ? ? he asked.
? Yes, the very same,? she said chokingly.
? No make-believe marriage ? ?
?* Nothing, nothing ! ? She drew nearer, and
commenced stroking his hand; then with some-
thing of her old impulsive abandonment she
pressed her lips to his forehead. _
? You will do right to send me away again,
she said. ? I was a wretch to leave you like that.
He patted her head, then drew back as if
ashamed.
? Where is Philip ? ? he asked.
She shook her head, and her eyebrows worked
for a minute or two. Then a sense of life s
desolateness without love tugged at the doors of
her heart, and she began to cry in a sudden woe-
ful way.
? There, there ! God bless my soul! ? he
exclaimed. Womans tears lay almost beyond
the pale of his memory.


He put up his hands and drew her head down,
till it lay upon his pillow beside him.
? Little stray lamb !? he said. Then after a
silence filled with sobs, ?Prodigal daughter?
and no fatted calf for her ! ? Then again, and
playfully, ? Mary, Mary, quite contrary!?
He settled matters half aloud, half to himself.
Numa was despatched for the travelled portman-
teau, and the boarding-house lady consulted
about another bedroom being prepared.
<c One of your best, and with a good view and
sofa,? said Mr. Allars.
And Mary?s eyes looked grateful. If to be
left free is pleasant, to be cared for, after over-
much freedom, softens and rests the heart. '


CHAPTER XIX
Numa brought in the portmanteau, and
thumped it down at Mr. Allars bed-loot.
Then he stood still and smiled, and figured
an imaginary moustache.
Mary was telling the story of the spoilt
wedding-day, and Mr. Allars was listening,
sometimes frowning and sometimes smiling.
Then Numa and the portmanteau came in.
Mary stopped in the midst of her story, and
Mr. Allars raised himself on one elbow, for out-
side on the corridor there was the frou-frou of a?
rustling dress, a quick-speaking voice, then a
light quick knock at the door.
�?Come in,? said Numa, and he smiled broadly.
Then Felise? beautiful, sad, dressed ravish-
inoly in a costume of cornflower-blue?entered.
Her look went past Numa to the bed, past the
bed to Mary.
? Pretty child 1 ? she exclaimed, and her voice
was tender and broken with emotion. ? Pretty
child, it is that I am sorry now ; I will say with
sorrow, I have been cold andhard ; and 1 have
sought you for forgiveness.?
And Mary?s heart leaped at the sight of
305 u


Philip?s beautiful mother suing to her for for-
giveness. She caught her two hands.
?It was my fault,? she said. ? I ought to
have explained.?
? No, no ! ? said Felise, and fell to embracing
and caressing her. ?It is not for human beings
to turn into stone, as I did. No sooner were
you gone, than my heart was torn in two. I
remembered your youth and childishness. I
said, ?lt is like myself again?thrown on the
world?s heart. And so young ! ? Only, you were
not so young as I was.?
?'Who is this, Mary ? ? asked Mr. Allars, in a
strangled sort of voice.
? This is Philip?s mother,? said Mary.
For a space Mr, Allars looked at this beautiful
woman who had had the spoiling of so many
lives in her hands, and no words came to his
lips. There seemed nothing to say.
He could have sworn rapidly and largely ; but
it seemed to him it would only be making an
exhibition of his powerlessness. He could have
ordered her from the room, but he had a shrewd
suspicion that she would not go.
And Felise looked at him, a long, steady
glance, from eyes pathetic and sad. She bent
her dark brows together, and allowed her lips
to tremble.
? His father ! ? she said, ? Mon Dieu ! mon
Dieu ! ?
Mary whispered, ? Hush ! ?
? But I cannot hush ! ? said Felise excitedly.
? 1 cannot! I have kept silent for twenty years,


and hidden my wound. Now I show you the
bleeding of my heart.?
? Madam,? ?said Mr. Allars sharply, ?you
forget you are in a sick-room and not upon the
stage.?
?I do not forget,? said Felise sobbingly. ?I
remember I am in the sick-room of one who has
been a selfish autocrat all his life, and is now so
old that he should go in fear and trembling of
death.?
Mr. Allars laughed harshly.
?Do you think only the white-headed die ?
he said.
But Felise went on feverishly.
?You would have separated my husband and
me at any cost ?even death or eternal disgrace.
You have parted these two ?Philip and this
pretty child; and you have not considered
whether you may not have ruined their names
or lives for ever.?
?Madam!? said Mr. Allars again, ?I have
brought them up. I know them almost as your
God knows you. When Philip returns home
they can be married. That first hour, if they
choose.?
f ? And,? continued Felise, ? you have parted
my boy from me; so that no mother?s kiss
might fall on his brow, and that my heart may
break with its loneliness.?
Then the door was pushed open again, and the
little brown man entered. Seeing Felise and
Mary, he stopped short, said ?Eh, eh,? re-
peatedly, and stared hard.


? This is the father of the man who murdered
my husband!? said Felise shudderingly. ?I
have heard of you so often.?
And the little brown man paled under his
brown, and moved shufflingly across the room.
? Get ?er out of this,? he said to Mr. Allars.
?We want no screeching women about in our
lives.?
But Felise planted herself in his way.
? Where is your son ? ? she demanded.
? Dead, marm,? he said, with a hideous smile;
but his eyes refused to meet her shining glance.
? Where is your son ? ? she demanded again.
? At the bottom of the sea, marm,? he replied,
and he shuffled sideways to the door.
Felise was before him, and blocked his way.
? Tell your friend over there where you have
hidden the murderer of his son these last ten
years,? she said, with a theatrical gesture.
? Turn round and face him while you tell.?
The little brown man?s face turned ashy-grey.
?Itis a lie ! ? he said. ? One of your damned
French lies! ?
Mr. Allars was sitting bolt upright, his eyes
starting forward, his hands clenched.
? Go on, go on ! ? he said hoarsely.
? Selwyn went back nine years ago,? said
Felise, ? went back to his father and threw
himself upon his mercy. Your friend has pro-
tected your son?s murderer, and sat at your table
with you eating your bread ! ?
? It is a lie ! ? said the little brown man again,
but he said it whiningly.


? And where is Selwyn now ? ? asked Mr.
AHars.
?A year ago,? continued Felise, ?his father
o-rew wearied of having his pockets drained
him, and he cast him aside and threatened him
with the gallows. And Selwyn, who is one of
the greatest cowards alive, tried to slip out of
Australia again. But another friend found him.
� Go on,? said the little man, turning in excited
self-forgetfulness. .
? And this other friend,? continued helise
quietly, ? this other friend was ingenious. He
knew that you??to Mr. AHars?? could not be
deceived, but he thought your grandson, who
had never known a father, might easily be. And
he palmed Selwyn oh to Philip as his fathei,
because he knew Philip had money and w T ould be
your heir.?
? But? Philip?and?my father ! burst from
Mary?s lips.
?Ah 1 ? said Felise, with one of her most
beautiful smiles, ? it is I who have come to take
you to both ?you and this autocrat who is so
dear to you, and this little hard man who is so
afraid of us all.?


CHAPTER XX
They went up the stairs to the attic in single
file. Mr. Allars, follow T ed by Mary, followed by
the little brown man, who looked as if he were
being driven along and prevented from slipping
away by the now shining-faced Felise.
Outside the front door of the Company?s board-
ing-house was the hired carriage in which they
had all come, and Numa sat on the box-seat
beside the coachman, enjoying this thing
tremendously.
And these four were all going to verify, so far
as sight could, this story that Elbe had told to
Felise.
Elbe?s object in telling the story at all had
been, as she had shown to Felise, purely a busi-
ness transaction. Her marriage with Rawson
had been moved from the very remote future to
the living present by the simple means of a
transference of � s. d., and her father?s safety
guaranteed upon Febse?s written sacred word.
And now they were all filing into the room,
breathless, grave-eyed, and one of them with a
weight of self-reproach upon her heart that her
feet could hardly bear her up.
310


In the room it was very dark, very still, and a
chill air smote their faces.
They had come, one with a little human long-
ing for little human vengeance, another with a
oreat stifled cry in her heart, of reproach against
and love for a father she had never known, love
for a lover she had distrusted, and hatred against
herself.
Mr. Allars, with cold face and eyes grave and
misty, and hands and knees that would shake
and tremble from weakness and agitation. And
the little brown man, full of miserable fears, full
of petty hate for every one, but most of all for
his fugitive, erring son. His little soul was
shrivelled up with fear at this undreamt-of
revealing of the dead, unburied past.
Inside the room it was very still. A little
hot air came in through the roof window, a
few muffled city sounds, a ray of dusty sun-
lio-ht.
�And just under it, upon the small corner bed,
lay a rigid body with still, set face.
The son of the little brown man lay dead. He
had gone into death?s ways wdio had been so
afraid to die.
Philip came in at the open door and stood
looking stupidly around.
? What does this mean ? ? he asked, bewildered.
Felise faced him, her warm eyes flashing.
?Philip, my son,? she said, ?you have been
protecting your father?s murderer ! ?
But the boy?s haggard face and great tired
eyes of misery smote her.


? Come away with me,? she begged. ? Come
away.?
Mary?s glance was riveted on her father?s face.
She drew nearer to the bedside, staring with
frightened eyes. She recognised the stranger
who had spoken to her upon her first night in
Sydney, and she remembered his words ?
? I only want to look at you. I would not
hurt a hair of your head.?
? I will stay with him,? she said tremulously.
?Heis my father. You can all go away.?
?Ay ! ? said the little brown man. ? ?Ee is
?er father. After all ?tis ?er right ter see to ?im.
I?ve done my dooty for gone nine years now,
?Oo can blame me ? ?
Mr. Allars put a shaking hand on Felise?s
shoulder.
? God has taken vengeance away from us,? he
said solemnly ; ? and look at them.?
And Felise looked at the two pairs of young
eyes flashing such eloquent love to each other, at
two young hands furtively clasped by the dead
man?s side.
Then she fell to sobbing bitterly.
? God pity and forgive us all,? said Mr. Allars
brokenly, and he even took her pretty white
hands into his.
? Eh, eh ! ? said the little brown man eagerly.

The Camp at Wandinong.
Illustrated by Frances Ewan and others.
? Ethel Turner has given us in ? The Camp at Wandinong ? such an
insight into the thoughts and nature of childhood as is nothing short
of marvellous. It is no exaggeration to say that in our experience no
truer representations of child life have ever been brought before the
public. Mrs. Curlewis?s pathos is of that simple and intimate descrip-
tion that will find its way straight to the hearts of her readers.
