Why Cutting Ruins the Cuticle
How you can, without cutting, keep the cuticle smooth and
firm with Cutex, the harmless liquid cuticle remover.
WHEN the cuticle is trimmed or cut away, the skin about the base of
the nail becomes dry and ragged. It constantly roughs up, and
forms hang-nails, and makes the hand hideously unattractive.
Cutex, the liquid cuticle remover, now makes it possible for you to have
shapely, symmetrical nails without clipping and cutting.
One application makes a decided improvement
Test Cutex on your nails. You will find orange stick and absorbent cotton
in the package. Wrap a little cotton around the end of the stick and dip
it into the Cutex bottle. Then gently push back the cuticle. Wipe off the
dead surplus skin. Rinse the hands in clear water. A little Cutex Nail
White —a soft white cream—thoroughly cleanses and removes discolorations
from underneath the nails. Cutex Nail Polish, in cake, stick, paste, powder
or liquid form, gives a quick waterproof polish.
After the first Cutex manicure, examine your nails. You will be amazed
at the improvement. Use Cutex regularly and the skin around the base of
your nails will soon take on the nice, smooth outline; each nail will have
the well-kept shapeliness that makes any hand lovely.
Start to-day to improve your nails
Ask for the Cutex Manicure Specialties wherever high-class toilet articles
are sold. Cutex Cuticle Remover, Nail White, Nail Polish, in cake, stick,
paste, powder or liquid form, are 2 6 each. Cutex Cuticle Comfort is also
2/6. You can also get complete sets, viz., Compact Sets 3/- each, Travelling
Sets 10/6 each, and Boudoir Sets 21/- each. Be sure to look for booklet on
the care of the nails in every package of Cutex Specialties.
If your favorite chemist or store does not sell Cutex preparations write direct

The King’s message on 21st October, 1914 (Trafalgar Day):—“We are fighting for a worthy pur-
pose, and we shall not lay down our arms until that purpose has been achieved.”
The Armistice was signed at 5 a.m. and orders were immediately flashed to cease firing at 11 a.m.
Thus the war actually ended at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918.
Introduction
to
The Souvenir of “Der Tag”
At home, abroad, at every gathering, pri-
vate or public, from the breakfast table to
the banquet hall, incidents and events of the
great war will form the subject of frequent
discussion for many years to come. The
authors of this Souvenir hope in some degree
to supply the want of a ready record by
combining many of the most notable events
in this small volume, together with a concise
historical sketch of the German dream of
“Der Tag.”
Although in the limited space available it
is impossible to provide a complete diary of
events, pains have been taken to furnish the
most reliable information regarding dates
and figures, in the hope that this Souvenir
may answer the purpose of a handy book of
reference.

The Kaiser in 1891:—“We Hohenzollerns take our crown from God alone. The soldier and the army,
not Parliamentary majorities and resolutions have welded together the German Empire. Only one is
master of the country—That am I—Who opposes me I shall crush to pieces.”
The Kaiser to his troops August 19, 1914:—“Exterminate first the treacherous English, and walk over
General French’s ‘Contemptible Little Army.’ ”
“Der Tag”
The Day! For many years before 1914
the German people had looked forward to
The Day—the day on which they were to
fight and conquer England) and then take
for themselves what they wanted of her
world-wide empire.
The Prussians in the middle of last cen-
tury set forth upon the path which it was
fondly hoped would lead to world do-
minion. Under Bismarck there was estab-
lished a policy of military despotism which
increased the power of Prussia and led to
the subjection of the petty German states
to the will of Prussia. A war was forced
upon Denmark in 1864, which resulted in
Prussia seizing Schleswig-Holstein, and so
making the Kiel Canal possible, A short
and successful war with Austria reduced
that Empire to a position of subordination
to Prussia. Then Bismarck forged the fa-
mous “Ems” telegram to Napoleon 111. in
1870. Prussia fell upon unprepared France
and defeated her. As an indemnity she took
Alsace-Lorraine and £200,000,000. The
money was paid so promptly that Bismarck
wanted to attack France again in 1875 and
crush her utterly, but was prevented by Eng-
land and Russia.
Wilhelm I. had been proclaimed German
Emperor in 1871. His son died after a
short reign, and Wilhelm 11. came to the
throne on June 15 th, 1888. Then the
power and greed of Prussianised Germany
waxed apace, and the Kaiser definitely set
out a policy of world conquest. He
acquired Colonies, and determined to pre-
pare the greatest Army the world had ever
known, and to build a Navy which might
successfully challenge that of Britain. He
was eager to dominate the whole civilised
world, and planned to make Germany the
greatest of all nations by robbing or des-
troying others, and he thought he could do
it himself. Bismarck, who had been prac-
tically Dictator up to then, was dismissed
on March 20, 1890, and became
an absolute monarch.
The whole of Germany was turned into
a drill ground; every eligible male was made
a soldier or sailor, and every one else was
fitted into the great Kaiser-controlled ma-
chine, which was to terrify the world. Wil-
helm went to Palestine and courted the Un-
speakable Turk with whom he entered into
a compact which virtually gave Germany
control of the Turkish Army. On Bth No-
vember, 1 898) at Damascus, he laid a wreath
on the tomb of Saladin, and swore eternal
friendship to the “300,000,000” of Islam.
The foxy Ferdinand of Bulgaria was
secretly annexed by Wilhelm, and a railway
to connect Berlin with Baghdad was com-
menced and was nearing completion in
1914. The way was made ready for the
seizure of India and the conquest of the East.
The one peril which stood solidly in the
way of the Kaiser’s boundless ambition was
the mighty British Navy. France and Rus-
sia might easily be overcome by Germany
and her allies, but without control of the
sea Germany could not advance very far.
Accordingly everything possible was done
to build rapidly a fleet that would be su-
perior to Britain’s. Then “The Day” would
come quickly.
Meanwhile, preparations were quietly
made throughout the world by German
agents, to undermine British influence and
secure trade and other advantages. An
elaborate spy system was established, and
unlimited funds supplied for buying politi-
cians, newspapers, and anything else like-
ly to serve Germany’s ends.
In 1904 Prince Bulow, then Chancellor,
proclaimed the Kaiser’s policy in a single
phrase: The King at the head of Prussia,
Prussia at the head of Germany, and Ger-
many at the head of the world.”
Several times subsequently Germany was
on the verge of war. Wilhelm bullied Rus-
sia in a famous speech in Vienna on 21st
September, 191 0, declaring that he would
stand by his ally in shining armour,” and
if necessary would use the “mailed fist.”


The Kaiser to his troops, October 2, 1914:—“Well, boys, before the leaves fall from the trees we shall
be back again in the dear Fatherland.”
The Kaiser, November 6, 1914:—“I am convinced that this campaign will add new pages of glory to
the history of your regiment. In all circumstances the enemy will e eaten.
He threatened France over Morocco in
1911. and would have fought but for Eng-
land’s intervention. Until the German Navy
was greater than England s he did not want
war with England, but manoeuvred for a
war in which Germany, aided by Austria,
would overthrow Russia and France. Then
an occasion would be made to attack Eng-
land. Every German was taught that Eng-
land would be deserted by her friends and
dominions, and would be destroyed for
ever. That was the day to which Ger-
many looked forward eagerly; to which all
her military and naval officers drank a toast
at their meetings.
The opportunity for crushing France and
Russia seemed to have arrived when the
Archduke Ferdinand, heir to the throne of
Austria-Hungary, was assassinated by a Ser-
bian youth at Serajevo, on 28th June, 1914.
The Kaiser took charge of the situation, and
used Austria as a catspaw. It was decided
to make it appear that the Serbian people
had murdered the Archduke, and that the
plot was hatched in Serbia itself. The terms
dictated by Austria to Serbia were so hu-
miliating that the Kaiser relied upon their
being rejected.
Austria was. to invade Serbia; Russia
would then take Serbia’s part, and
that would bring France in as Russia s ally.
Germany as Austria’s ally would therefore
appear as if compelled by Russia to fight.
England, as she was not formally an ally
of France and Russia, would not think of
coming in. The field would be clear for a
smashing blow at the two great continental
enemies. A nice plan—had it worked.
Germany and Austria were well prepared;
Russia and France, it was believed, were not.
Every event necessary to bring about the
war designed by Germany was planned to
move, and did move, with appalling swift-
ness. Austria declared war against Serbia
on July 28th, Germany against Russia on
August Ist, against Belgium on August 2nd,
and against France on August 3rd.
The war would be all over in a few
and Germany would emerge all
powerful in Europe, with the Kaiser as some-
thing superior to Napoleon, Caesar and
Hannibal, as a War Lord.
With the German lust for victory every
rule of God and man was broken, and firm
belief in her devilish doctrine led her into
serious errors of judgment.
Thus the Kaiser had taken the fatal step
on the Ist of August, 1914.
Unfortunately for his beautiful plan,
staunch old England did come in. The
Kaiser and his Ministers little dreamt that
a trifle like the Belgian treaty of 1839 would
make any difference. They had neither
honor nor chivalry themselves, and could
not conceive that a great nation like Eng-
land would risk all for the sake of a “scrap
of paper.”
But England was adamant on the ques-
tion of Belgium. Her fleet was ready to fore-
stall “the day.” This was not “The Day”
of which Germany had talked and dreamt
so long. Her idea of “the day” was one on
which she would attack England with a su-
perior fleet and smash her. Germany had
always fought as a bully against weaker foes.
She had looked forward to defeating France
and Russia first, and then—farewell Eng-
land! Hail “Deutschland über Alles.”
The Kaiser had started his vast war ma-
chine, and it could not be stopped. The
war with England began at 1 1 pm. on the
4th August, 1914, but it began the wrong
way for Germany.
On the few occasions on which any of
the German Navy sneaked out of its shelter
at Kiel, it was defeated by the British. The
only “successes of the Huns at sea were
those of their piratical submarines, which
attacked passenger ships and fired on de-
fenceless sailors, women and children.
England was treated with contempt as a
military power, but her contemptible
army” grew to one of over five millions,
against which the picked troops of the
Kaiser attacked in vain.
Instead of being deserted by her
dominions, England was supported in her
stand for justice by all of them. Australia,
New Zealand; Canada, South Africa and
India—each rendered prompt and noble
service in the war against the Hun. The
British Empire retained the respect and ad-
miration of the rest of the world, and is
to-day stronger and freer than ever.


I
The Kaiser, December 19, 1914:—“God’s greatness will guide the German people, through battle
victory, to the goal appointed for the German people by Providence.”
The Kaiser, Christmas Day, 1914:—“We stand with our hearts turned towards God.
all enemies of Germany! Amen.”
To the dust with
Germany was defeated because she
thought honor was of no value, and that
might was right. Her prophet, General Bern-
hardi, in 1911 warned her that the issue in
the next war would be “world power or
downfall.” He was confident, however, it
would lead to world power if Germany
struck hard and remorselessly, mercilessly
and without pity. She did so, and waged
the war in a manner beyond all precedent
barbarous and inhuman. Yet her efforts
failed. She has further fouled her already
blood-stained name, and cannot again be
regarded as a nation of honourable people.
She achieved not “world power,” but
“downfall.”
“The Day” that did come for Germany
was the 1 1 th November, 1918, when her
representatives, in answer to Marshal Foch,
“Who are you gentlemen?” meekly signed
the Armistice prepared by him, admitting
the utter defeat of Imperial Germany,
Another “day” followed. On the 21st
November, 1918, the whole German fleet
came out to meet the British fleet for the
first time—not to fight, but to surrender.
There must be no cheering” was Sir
David Beatty’s general order.
Slowly, and in grim silence, the stately
battle squadron of 74 ships crossed the
North Sea in a solemn procession, unarmed,
and down the channel formed by Beatty’s
Ist and 2nd Battle Squadrons, according to
the order of the British Admiralty, to be in-
terned in British waters—at Scapa Flow.
Admiral Sir David Beatty’s historic com-
mand had been flashed to Admiral Von
Reuter—
“The German flag is to be hauled down at
15.57 (sunset, 3 minutes to 4 p.m.) to-day, Thurs-
day, and it is not to be hoisted again without
permission.”
At the appointed time, in sullen obedience
to their conquerors, the Germans lowered
the pirate ensign from the mainmast of every
ship.
Thus, the second greatest navy the world
has known, proud in its youth, arrogant in
its desire to fulfil a high Imperial mission,
ignobly abandoned its vainglorious chal-
lenge to the sea supremacy of Britain, with-
out the striking of a blow. And thus ended
the German dream of “Der Tag.’’
Never again will Germany be a menace to
the peace of the world. She may survive
internal revolutions and once more take her
place among the nations. Never under any
circumstances will she be allowed to prepare,
on land and sea, for such a “Day” as she
foolishly dreamed of for half a century.
“Who are You, Gentlemen?”
By A. F. Serle
These verses first appeared in the Melbourne “Argus” of 19th November, 1918.
“Who are you, gentlemen? We are they
Who, burning with hate and pride brought low,
Famine-driven and damned for aye*
Beg for the mercy we would not show.
“We are the voice of a nation proud,
That knew not honor nor truth,
Whose Royalty creeps in its winding shroud
And flees from the wrath of its youth.
“We are the answer to Might is Right,’
The barbarous creed of the Hun,
Who would drench the world with its poisonous blight
For a madman’s place in the sun.
“We are the answer to prayer that seemed vain
While the blood of the bravest ran
To a faith that held through hells of pain—
We are God’s answer to man!’’


The Kaiser to his Guards, April, 1915: —“The foe is defending his native soil foot by foot. This is a
resistance of despair, but it must be broken. He has prepared his soup, and now he must sup it. I
look to you to see to it.”
The Kaiser, October 22, 1915: —“America had better look out after the war. I shall stand no nonsense
from the Americans.”

The Kaiser to Officers, Summer, 1915:—“In a just cause I am ready to force myself to be cruel.”
How Rexona Helped Our Soldiers to Win the War
REXONA the Rapid Healer is the King of Ointments, and a favourite throughout Australia, which
proved itself just as necessary in the trenches as in the home. Most of our boys have been
brought up to treat their minor injuries with Rexona so they needed it in the trenches. Rexona
saved our soldier boys a lot of suffering and proved worth its weight in gold. When cut, burnt,
wounded, or injured the boys always fly to the tin of Rexona, and Rexona prevented the wounds
from becoming serious. We have received letters from numbers of soldiers on active service who
thank Rexona for healing their terrible wounds, and making their skin sound ancj healthy again, and
ordering a supply of Rexona to be sent to them.
Below are two of the letters we have received from our boys in praise of Rexona the Rapid Healer.—

“ All Australians prove themselves when put to the
test, so does REXONA.
“I left Australia 11th May, 1915, and went to Gal-
lipoli. After 4| months in the trenches at Quinn’s
Post. I was blown up by a mine exploding. I also
received nineteen (19) shrapnel wounds in my legs,
I, like all our boys, received a Christmas Billy, and
enclosed inside was a tin of Rexona. While in the
No. 3 A.G.H. at Heliopolis, Egypt, I used it fre-
quently on my wounds. While other remedies
failed, Rexona completely cured them.
“I am quite well again and
able to take up my duties
in life as before, many
thanks to the unsurpass-
able healing and soothing
powers of Rexona. I as-
sure one and all, any
soldier at the Front will
be pleased with a tin of
Rexona. If he uses it once
he will always use it.
“ I can recommend with
confidence Rexona, as
I have given it the ful-
lest of tests, and, fur-
thermore, I have sent
several tins to friends
now serving in the A.I.F.
Yours truly,

“I’d like to add my testimony to the value of Rexona Ointment. A soldier pal of mine cured himself of painful
hemorrhoids solely by its aid, and I have, by degrees, come to believe in it as the most curative ointment to be
had in the world. I have found it particularly effective as a healing agent in skin sores and wounds. Heaven knows
Iye seen enough of them to last me a lifetime and I know what lam talking about. I can recommend Rexona
Ointment heartily for (1) hemorrhoids because I have seen it work, and {2) for cuts and sores that have become
unhealthy through a worker’s carelessness.
I remain, yours faithfully.
(Sgd.) S. R. SIMPSON, No. 736, First Battalion.”
Rexona First at the Front and First at Home
“The best for him who gave of his best ” is the motto of every home where little stores of comforts
are being purchased for the returning soldier boy. If you wish these comforts to be complete you
must include Rexona, for Rexona is the best Rapid Healer of the age, and the king of ointments.
Your boy will find hundreds of uses for Rexona in the little accidents of every-day life, just as he
needed it during the strenuous days on the battlefield. Rexona is the ever-ready friend and should
be kept in every household, ready for all emergencies, and every member of your family will welcome
the triangular pot of Rexona, for Rexona heals cuts, sores, burns, eczema, piles, bad legs, and all skin
diseases and eruptions with remarkable rapidity. Rexona the Rapid Healer is sold only in triangular
pots at 1/6 or in larger size, holding nearly four times the quantity, price 3/-.

The Kaiser, October, 1918:—“The hour is gone, but trusting in your strength and God’s gracious help,
we feel ourselves strong en ough to defend our beloved Fatherland.”


The total war casualties were nearly 26,000,000, the death roll being not less than 8,000,000. Russia’s
casualties are said to have totalled 9,000,000.
It is reported that Germany’s war casualties numbered 6,885,000, including 1,840,000 dead and
103,000 missing; 260,000 fate unknown; 618.000 were prisoners; wounded 4,064,000. She rtiobilised
11,003,000. '
Mr. Asquith (Prime Minister) on August 6, 1914,
stated
We are fighting to vindicate the principle
that small nationalities are not to
be crushed, in defiance of international good
faith, by the arbitrary will of a strong and
overmastering power. I do not believe any
nation ever entered into a great controversy
—and this is one of the greatest history will
ever know—with a clearer conscience and
stronger conviction that it is fighting not
for aggression, not for the maintenance even
of its own selfish interest, but in defence
of principles the maintenance of which is
vital to the civilisation of the world, and
with the full conviction, not only of the
wisdom and justice, but of the obligations
which lay upon us to challenge this great issue.
Mr. Lloyd George (Prime Minister) on November
9, 1918, at the Guildhall Banquet, stated
But in this solemn moment of triumph,
one of the greatest moments in the history
of the world, which is passing like a dream
—we cannot realise it —it will take years,
generations, centuries to develop the great-
ness of this hour that you and I are passing
through now; but in this great hour which
rings in a new era and the end of a colossal
struggle which is going to lift humanity to
a higher plane of existence in the ages of
the future, let us here and now own how
much we are indebted to the valiant men
who fought and endured so that we should
enter into this bright inheritance.
King George’s Message to the Forces, November
11, 1918, states
Soldiers of the British Empire! In France
and Belgium the prowess of your arms, as
great in retreat as in victory, has won the
admiration alike of friend and foe, and has
now by a happy historic fate enabled you
to conclude the campaign by capturing
Mons, where your predecessors of 1914 shed
the first British blood. Between that date
In the Captain’s Mess, in the Banquet Hall,
The officers feasted, one and all,
Like sweep of sabre, or sail on swing,
One seized his glass, let three words ring
Short and sharp like a rudder’s play.
Spoke three words only—"To the Day!
and this you have traversed a long and
weary road; defeat has more than once
stared you in the face; your ranks have been
thinned again and again by wounds, sick-
ness and death; but your faith has never
faltered, your courage has never failed? your
hearts have never known defeat. With your
Allied comrades you have won the day.

“ Pence hath, her victories not less renowned than War ”
The Encouragement of Australian
Manufactures
Give it impetus during the early years of Peace
NECESSITY IS A STERN MOTHER. During four years of war she has taught Australians
inany things, not the least of which is the need for Australia to arouse herself to become
more self-reliant and self-supporting in regard to those commodities for the supply of
which she has hitherto depended on foreign countries.
A country like Australia, with all her vast wealth of untouched resources, can never fully realise her nation-
hood till she is able to clothe herself commendably with the products of her own looms and factories.
Rapid strides towards this goal have happily been made during the war. New factories have sprung up through-
out the Commonwealth, and it would probaly surprise many a citizen if statistics were presented showing the in-
crease in softgoods industries alone since 1914.
But enterprise in the starting of manufactures is not in itself sufficient. It remains for the trading community
of Australia to foster the patronage of Australian products much more than is at present being done.
The work of education of the general public along these lines is, of course, a big subject. In addition, how-
ever, much might be done by the Federal Government to encourage new industries during the early years of peace,
as unquestionably some such policy will be needed to combat the possibility of unemployment and to aid in the work
of repatriation. For ourselves, as Retail Merchants, we have never lost an opportunity to give Australian manufac-
tures the benefit of our support.
Take the articles briefly advertised below as instances of what Australia is doing to-day. We consider that
there is nothing better made outside the Commonwealth, and that these standard products well deserve the patron-
age of the most critically minded judges of quality and value.

pM)R medicinal purposes Olive Oil has long been recognised as invaluable. For pulmonary and
wasting diseases it has no equal.
It is the most digestible of all fats and has the peculiar property of opening the gall duct, thus
permitting the free passage of the bile into the digestive organs, and so helps to make that per-
fect emulsion which other oils do not accomplish. It contains no lactic or butyric acid, and is
more perfectly assimilated than either butter or cream.
“It is the sun’s natural fat hung in the olive trees for the food of man, and supplied in this
form of subsistance to over one half of the world’s inhabitants.”
The Olive Oil bearing the guarantee of E. F. DOWNEY, is without a peer among other domestic
oils. It possesses an inimitable, delicious flavor and delicate boquet peculiarly its own, and not
possessed by any other oil.

By the close of 1917 the British Mercantile Marine had lost 7,079,000 tons through enemy action
had built 3,031,000 tons, and taken over 780,000 enemy tonnage.


In April, 1918, for the first time since the submarine campaign began the total tonnage built by Britain
and foreign states exceeded the total tonnage sunk by the submarines.
Australia’s total voluntary enlistments were 416,809. Of these 329,716 embarked, 58,767 died, 166,798
were wounded, 86,706 were sick, 1,724 were taken prisoner, 194 were missing, and 219 were casu-
alties unspecified. The latest compilation of figures up to January 31st, 1919, gave total casualties at
428,805, thus indicating that many were wounded more than once.
HINDENBURG and VON TIRPITZ— They helped to gain “Der Tag.”
Von Hindenburg ordered that bread which
had been found soaked in paraffin should be
given as food to Russian prisoners.
On the Spmme in 1917 he ordered that
everything should be destroyed, burnt and
pillaged. He was responsible for the viola-
tion of tombs at Carlepont, Candor and
Roilese in March, 1917.
Von Tirpitz, under the Kaiser’s
was responsible for the ruthless submarine
campaign.


Stephen A. Whiteman, of Rabaul, and his brother were (on August 6th, 1914) the first two Australians
(civilians) taken prisoner by the Germans. On their release S. A. Whiteman was responsible for the
capture of the German Governor’s armed yacht, the “Komet,” now H.M.A.S. Una.
The enlistments during the war for the various Australian States were:—New South Wales, 164,030;
Victoria, 112,399; Queensland, 57,705; South Australia, 34,959; Western Australia, 32,231; Tas-

The first Australian to win the Victoria Cross was Lance-Corporal Albert Jacka, of 14th Battalion
(Victoria), 4th Infantry Brigade, at Courtney’s Point, Gallipoli, on the night of May 19-20, 1915. He
afterwards won the M.C. as a Lieutenant, and is now a Captain.


The first member of the A.I.F. to be killed in the great war was Dr. Brian Golden Antill Pockley, Cap-
tain in the A.A.M.C. He was shot at Rabaul on 11th September, 1914, whilst rendering first-aid to a
wounded private.
Australia’s war debt to June the 30th, 1918, amounted to £220,000,000. It will amount to considerably
more.
On November 9th, 1918, British Troops landed unopposed to occupy the Gallipoli Peninsula.

Serbia and Montenegro, relatively speaking, suffered greater losses in lives than any other of the Allies.
Serbia alone lost about 320,000 men up to the arrival in Corfu in 1916. Serbia’s estimated losses
amount to 10,000,000,000 francs, exclusive of war expenses.
The German forces under General Von Lettow Vorveck in German East Africa surrendered an the
Chambezi River on November 14th, 1918, thus ending the last phase of German control in Africa.
It is the captured Prussian Hog which terrorised Europe for so many years.”


Where one American soldier has died to save the world from German despotism, in proportion at least
20 Australians have died, and 100 New Zealanders, yet President Wilson and the American Representa-
tives strongly opposed Australia and New Zealand having a place at the Peace Conference.

WHY has Germany advanced to such power that she has
been able to hold the world in check for four years ?
Because
Her rulers have preached the doctrine of support-
ing home-trading to the exclusion of all other.
I
The following “Ten Commands ” have been circulated in Germany in
millions for three years prior to the war :
1. In all expenses keep in mind the interests
of your own compatriots.
2. Never forget that when you buy a foreign
article your own country is the poorer.
3. Your money should profit no one but
Germans.
4. Never profane German factories by using
foreign machinery.
5. Never allow foreign eatables to be served
at your table.
6. Write on German paper with a German pen
and use German blotting paper.
7. German flour, German fruit, and German
beer can alone give your body the true
German energy.
8. If you do not like German malt coffee,
drink coffee from German Colonies.
9. Use only German clothes for your dress and
German hats for your head.
10. Let not foreign flattery distract you from
these precepts; and be firmly convinced,
whatever others say, that German pro-
ducts are the only ones worthy of citizens
of the German Fatherland.
Let all Australians read these carefully—learn them, and apply them to them-
selves in the fostering of Australian Industries —and when we say-l Australian,
we mean Australian.
KRESOLVO « essentially Australian
It was put on the Australian market and registered by us in 1906 in competi-
tion with the well-known German disinfectant, but notwithstanding that it was
sold much cheaper—the quality being superior—Australia would have none of
it, and the money spent with Germany, in purchasing their line to the exclusion
of Kresolvo, has helped them to make shells to kill the flower of our manhood
in Gallipoli and France.
KRESOLVO is made in Australia, bottled and cased in Australian-made
containers —and every bottle you buy will help to strengthen Australia’s hand.
KRESOLVO is the best and cheapest Disinfectant sold in Australia. It is
used for all purposes and is put up in bottles, tins or drums. Supplied to the
State Drug Store, Sydney, Newcastle and other leading Hospitals.

“The Day”
November 11th, 1918
By Richard Le Galliene
“The Day!”
O fatal and fantastic toast
Your idle princes of the sea
Drank to each other, making silent boast.
With lifted glass, towards that immortal coast
- Whose names are one—England and Liberty.
The dream that Spain,
And even Napoleon, had dreamed in vain.
“The Day!”
When France should die in very deed,
France, whose grave soul is ever the world’s need—
Strange flower that we call France!
Flower that to a sword so swiftly turns.
Changing disaster into a dance.
And to dim lands that gropingly ascend
Brings wisdom like a friend;
Whose altar burns
With such clear flame of courage to the skies
That even her foes'
Marvel that men so gay can be so wise
And go to battle as lovers to a rose.
“The Day!”
O, Kaiser, can this be “the Day”
You dreamed of? Did you mean
This Day—November, the eleventh day
Of the year nineteen hundred and eighteen?

During the war and to 11th November, 1918, the total losses of the Royal Navy, including the Royal
Naval Air Service, to March 31sl. 1918, and Royal Marines, were 39,766, including 33,361 dead. Total
lives lost in Marine Mercantile were 17,956.


The greatest poison gas plant in the world, covering 300 acres, about 26 miles from Baltimore, U.S.A.,

An official report on the treatment of British prisoners of war in Turkey in November, 1918, discloses
that of a total of 16,583 officers and men captured by the Turks 3,290 had been reported dead, while
2,220 remained untraced, and it is believed that all perished. Of 2,680 British non-coms and privates
taken at Kut, 1,300 died and 499 are untraced; that is, over 65 per cent, perished.
H.M.A.S. AUSTRALIA, Rear-Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey’s Flagship, which led the Second Battle
Squadron at the surrender of the German Fleet on 21st November, 1918.


Revolution in Germany definitely started from the attempt by the Kaiser to send the German Fleet out
for final battle. The men of the High Seas Fleet refused to be sacrificed, and the most critical moment
of the mutiny came on October the 31st, 1918, when half of the fleet was about to open fire on the
other half.
The war left the former empire of Austria-Hungary in a condition of political and economic chaos
surpassed only by that of Russia.
The Kaiser’s Abdication
On November 30 the Emperor’s abdica-
tion, only two days old, was published in
Berlin. It read:
By the present document I renounce
forever my rights to the Crown of
Prussia and the rights to the German
Imperial Crown, I release at the same
time all the officials of the German Em-
pire and Prussia, and also all officers,
non-commissioned officers and soldiers
of the Prussian Navy and Army, and
of contingents from confederated
States from the oath of fidelity they
have taken to me, as their Emperor,
King and supreme chief.
I expect from them, until a new
organisation of the German Empire
exists, that they will aid those who
effectively hold the power of Germany,
to protect the German people against
the menacing dangers of anarchy,
famine and foreign denomination.
Made and executed and signed by
our own hand with the Imperial seal
at Amerongen, Nov. 28, 1918.
WILHELM.
Crown Prince’s Abdication
The former Crown Prince, in contradict-
ing a report that he had abdicated at the
same time as his father, stated:—
“I have not renounced anything, and I
have not signed any document whatever.”
He added that, should the German Govern-
ment decide for a republic, he would be
content to return to Germany as a simple
citizen, ready to do anything to assist his
country—even to working as a laborer in
a factory. But three days later, December
6, he issued the following:—
I renounce formally and definitely
all rights to the Crown of Prussia and
the Imperial Crown, which would have
fallen to me by the renunciation of
the Emperor-King, or for other reasons.
Given by my authority and signed
by my hand: done at Wieringen, De-
cember ]> 1918.

Emperor of the Germans, Germany being
the conglomeration of States, some of which
were smaller than a fair-sized Australian
cattle run.
Germany comprised—
Four Kingdoms (all the kings have been de-
throned).
Six Grand Duchies (five grand dukes have
been deposed). - -
Five Duchies (three have been deposed).
Seven Principalities (four have been deposed).
Reichland—i.e., Alsace and Lorraine (re-
stored to France).
The Hanse Towns—i.e., Lubeck, Bremen*
and Hamburg.
A London authority says that no fewer
than 278 kings, queens, princes, princesses,
dukes and duchesses of Germany have ab-
dicated or been dethroned. Bavaria heads
the list, having sent 39 royalties into exile;
Prussia comes next, with 33; Brunswick is
the lowest on the list, with five.

On November 13th, 1918, for the fourth time in a century, British battleships passed through the Dar-
danelles and arrived at Constantinople on a mission of war.
In March, 1915, when the British Board of Trade appealed to women to volunteer for war service,
20,000 applicants registered in one week.
The Grand Fleet’s Thanksgiving
On the day of the German naval sur-
render, Admiral Beatty signalled to all the
ships of the Grand Fleet: “It is my intention
to hold a Service of Thanksgiving at 18.00
(6 p.m.) to-day (November 21), for the
victory which Almighty God has vouchsafed
to H.M. arms, and every ship is recom-
mended to do the same.” Needless to say,
the recommendation was carried out.
The Order of the Service of Thanksgiving
held on board the “Queen Elizabeth,” Sir
David Beatty’s flagship, was practically the
same as that followed in the Church of Eng-
land on the previous Sunday. It began with
Hymn 166 (“All people that on earth do
dwell”). The Lesson was from Revelation
xxi., 1-9 ( And I saw a new heaven and a
new earth”). Then came the Address, and
then Hymn 298 (“Praise my soul, the King
of Heaven ). Some of the Thanksgiving
sentences, differing slightly from those used
in the churches on the 1 7th, were as fol-
lows:—“For the triumph over the enemy
fleet and for the victory which Thou hast
granted to our arms: Praise be to Thee, O
Lord Most High. For the trust in the Navy
shown by our people at home through years
of danger and anxiety: Praise be to Thee, O
Lord Most High. For that Thou hast en-
abled us to save our land from invasion and
our people from famine and distress: Praise
be to Thee> O Lord Most High, For the
preservation of our lives after long years of
war and for the hope of a righteous peace:
Praise be to Thee, O Lord Most High. For
the spirit of cheerfulness, loyalty, and
brotherhood that has inspired our Fleet:
Praise be to Thee, O Lord Most Fligh.”
Hymn 379 (“Now thank we all our God”)
was sung before the Blessing, and after it
God Save the King.”
The Price of Victory to the British Empire
Like everything else in the Great War, the figures are stupendous, namely, a grand
total of 3,049,991 British casualties on land up to November 10th, 1918. The analysis
is as follows. The British Empire mobilised an army of 8,000,000.


On November 23, 1918, Strasburg set its clocks to French time, and Marshal Foch made his triumphal
entry and crossed the River 111 two miles west of the Rhine.
On November 19th, 1918, Marshal Retain made his triumphal entry into Metz, the capital of Lorraine.

An American War Correspondent states: —“Again and again I have heard German people say, ‘Thank
God the English have come,’ and 1 believe they say that with sincerity.”


The Allies’ Peace Terms were presented to the German Delegates at Versailles on May the 7th, 1919.
It is a coincidence that this date is the 4th anniversary of the greatest crime committed by Germany—
the torpedoing of the “Lusitania.”
An officer of the Greek Department of Justice, after visiting Seres, in Macedonia, reported on November
20, 1918:—In September, 1917, the inhabitants of Seres were 23,693, of which 14,938 were Greeks,
7,925 Turks and 730 Israelites. In September, 1918, after the Bulgarian occupation the inhabitants
were 5,793, of which half were Bulgarians.

Part of the German fleet which surrendered to the Allies is seen lying at Anchor unarmed.
It is estimated that the warships surrendered by Germany cost considerably over £50,000,000.

A correspondent of the London “Times” wrote from Sofia on November 6th, 1918:—“To-day I am
semi-officially informed that out of 100,000 interned Serbs only 53,000 survive. Out of 8,000 in the
Serbian prisoner’s camp at Haskovo no fewer than 5,000 have died.
A Rome message says it is officially stated that out of 345,000 Italian prisoners in Austria 83,241
died. Out of 700,000 Austrian prisoners in Italy 6,000 died.

This modern bathroom is equipped with a “Malley” High Power Heater
Malley’s Famous Gas Bath Heaters
Easiest to operate—most economical in use-safest and best
Hot Water is now an essential in every
Australian home—and rightly so. In the
modern kitchen, bathroom and even in the
laundry, it is difficult in these days of progress
and efficiency to get along without a plentiful
supply of hot water. And in thousands of
Australian homes Malley’s Australian-
made Heaters are proving their usefulness
and high efficiency.
Malley’s Gas Heaters solve the hot water
problem easily and economically. No more
bother with fuel and fires-no more carrying
pots and kettles of hot water when one wants
a bath —no more delay. These famous heaters
have been brought to the highest pinnacle of
success, and they provide you with ample hot
water a few moments after they are lighted.
No delay like you have been used to—no in-
convenience whatever. Simply turn on the
small gas jet, light it, and the hot water will
flow abundantly a few seconds after. And
Malley’s Heaters are well-known for their
economy in gas consumption, it having been
proved that a hot water bath with a plen-
tiful supply of hot running water costs
less than a halfpenny.
Demonstrations are held daily at our
Liverpool Street showrooms-just a few steps
from George Street —so that you can see them
under actual service conditions. See for your-
self before you buy a heater.

Table viii, 25
25 Year Endowment
Life?
Because the benefits of a
wisely selected policywill
suit both present and un-
foreseen circumstances
A Life Assurance policy
provides for the policy-
holder who lives or for
his family if he dies.
Endowment Assurance
costs nothing but re-
peated efforts to save
money.
The policyholder creates
for hitnseif a valuable
asset which will become
free, during his own life-
time, after his contribu-
tions have all been made.
While he need not die to
win, his estate will be
compensated if he does
die prematurely,
A “Co-operative” policy-
holder enjoys exceptional
benefits, many of which
are nearer than the ma-
turity date.
Some men say: “My in-
come is barely sufficient
now to afford a comfort-
able living.” The Life
Assurance man asks:
“How then will the fam-
ily live when there is no
income because of the
death of the bread-
winner?”
Others say: "If the Com-
pany can afford to as-
sure lives for the pre-
miums asked, and can
make money by the
transaction, I will carry
my own Insurance and
thus save the premium.”
The Life Assurance man
replies: “You cannot
carry your own risk hny
more than you can carry
a letter from Sydney to
London for a penny. A
Life Assurance Company
can carry the risk for the
premium fixed by its
Actuary, and the Post
Office authorities can
carry your letter to Lon-
don for Id. (plus war tax),
but you cannot do either.”
A Life Assurance policy
may be regarded as a
certificate of good family
history, good personal
health, good habits and
intentions.

Extract from Actuarial
Report of T. W. BREMNER,
Esq., F.F.A., A.1.A., dated
2nd March, 1917: “The
security for the Com-
pany’s policy holders
shows a very large mar-
gin of safety.”
Assure with the Co-operative Assurance Company, Limited.
T. H. HICKS, Secretary,
It is a young and progressive company; a company directed
by experienced, professional and business men who are finan-
cially interested in its success.
Because its constitution and rules are based upon a century of
practical experience.
Its objective and methods are modern and acceptable to all
classes of the community.
Because it gives the greatest available security to its policy-
holders.
It has already made excellent progress and is destined to
become a great institution, conducted and governed wholly by
people directly interested in its welfare.
Because it pays all claims immediately after admission.
The “Co-operative” House Purchase policy affords an equit-
able and convenient method of procuring homes for wage-
earners, by payment of monthly subscriptions, which they
would otherwise pay as rent.
Because every man who is dependent upon wages is both
invited and enabled to become the owner of real estate.
A man of 25 next birthday can effect a 20-year Endowment
Assurance Policy for £5OO with Profits, at an annual premium
of £23/11/8, and borrow the face value of his policy at the end
of five (5) years, for the purchase of an approved house.
Because the Life Risk is carried by the Company from date
of issue of the Policy, and premature death would at once
enable the Company to hand Free Deeds to the member’s
estate, besides any surplus which might be revealed by the
account after the proceeds of the policy had been credited
and the mortgage discharged.
Other Rates will be quoted on application.
