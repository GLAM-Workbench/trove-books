PROSPECTUS
OF A
| WEEKLY PAPER, TO BE ENTITLED “THE COLONIST.” ||
u Union is Strength .”
\ It has long been matter of surprise and regret that the Presbyterians of New South Wales, who form a
\ large section of our general population, at least equal to any other in point of intelligence and worth,
j and who constitute the third in point of number of the leading religious denominations of the colony,
< have no proper representation, no peculiar channel of influence, in the public press of the colony. Such
I a state of things does not exist in other countries in which Presbyterians form a large section of the
\ general population. In Scotland, for instance, in the North of Ireland, and in the United States of
\ America, Presbyterians have their weekly and bi-weekly papers, as well as their monthly religious
I magazines, in which the body is virtually represented, and its general objects and interests advocated and
s promoted, and which thus exert a powerful influence for good in these countries.
I I The divided state of the Presbyterian body for a long series of years past has doubtless been the prin- | \
: I cipal cause of this state of things in New South Wales; but the prospect of a general union of the \ \
\ I Presbyterians of the colony renders it peculiarly desirable that a weekly paper should be established to ;«
> advocate such a union beforehand, and to promote its proper objects when accomplished. A monthly j I
| religious magazine, however ably conducted, can never supply the want of a weekly paper; as such a 1 <
j publication cannot, with any degree of propriety, undertake the discussion of many of those questions that I \
I bear upon the general interests and welfare of this particular section of our colonial population.
\ The Presbyterian church was the first-boni of the Beformation. It was the form which that great j \
> work uniformly took in all those countries in which it was effected by the joint efforts of the clergy and if
\ people ; as in Switzerland, in France, in Holland, in Scotland, in Hungary, and over a large part of Protestant j J
\ Germany. It was only where imperious and virtually despotic monarchs presumed, with sacrilegious < \
| hands, to mould the Beformation agreeably to their own fancies or supposed interests, as in the case of 11
I Henry the Eighth, Queen Elizabeth and the Stuarts, that a different system was introduced and prevailed, j \
I In the countries enumerated above, and in the United States and British colonies of America, there is at ; <
\ this moment a much larger number of Presbyterians than there is of any other section of Protestantism; and |
I the noble army of martyrs to whom the Presbyterian church can point, greatly exceeds all those of all the s <
I other sections of Protestantism put together. Besides, the Presbyterian church has in every country in | ?
\ which it has existed, with any degree of its pristine vigour, been uniformly identified with the cause of \ I
j civil and religious liberty, both at home and abroad. With such honourable and glorious antecedents, it | <
| cannot be doubted that the welfare and advancement of this entire community will be materially pro- j <
I moted in proportion as the Presbyterians of the colony continue to venerate and to carry out in their colonial j j
| practice the time-honoured institutions of their father-land. | j
II It is proposed, therefore, to publish on Saturday, the ,4th of April next, a weekly journal, to be entitled |«
I “ The Colonist,” to circulate principally, but not exclusively, among the Presbyterians of the colony. J.
I It will be printed in the Demy Folio form, half the size of the present daily papers ; and will therefore \:
j resemble in size, and pretty much in internal arrangement, the old Colonist of 1835, and the Atlas of | !
I 1844, two weekly papers by far the most influential in their day of any that have ever appeared in this |
; f I colony. \ I
: | Each number of the Colonist will contain one or more leading articles on the great political questions I j
> of the day, with a summary of the events of the week, and such political and general intelligence as may |
jbe deemed interesting and important to the public. This part of the paper will be conducted by ; |
i | Mr George Dunmore Lang, Member for the Tumut district in the Parliament of 1859, who has < ■
; j already had considerable experience in connection with the colonial press. > ■
| There will also be a certain amount of space allotted in every number for Religious Intelligence, in which ; j
> the movements of religious bodies generally, but especially of the Presbyterian Church in New South | ,
> Wales and the neighbouring colonies, will be detailed, with such remarks and comments as each case will | :
J. seem to require.
yUj The Colonist will be Printed and Published at the Office of the old Colonist of 1835, in Jamison
Jlt Street, Sydney. Subscriptions Six Shillings and Six Pence per Quarter. (til
Sydney, 12th February, 1863.
