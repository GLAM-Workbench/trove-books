MARJORIE MAY’S
TWELFTH BIRTHDAY
by
MARY PAULINE CALLENDER
DEDICATED TO MOTHERS
THE WORLD OVER


A^4834/6>
ZB-4-°t3>
MOTHER, dear, you are the best in
-LVjL the whole world," said Marjorie May,
after her birthday guests had gone home.
"I know I will never forget my twelfth
birthday because of this lovely party." And
saying this, Marjorie May walked over and
sat by her mother’s side.
She was silent for a moment, then said
pensively, “Mother, I cannot understand why
Cousin Margaret, who is generally full of
fun, was so quiet at the party. At first I
thought I had done something to offend her.
I placed her next to me at the table; I told
her how much I liked her new dress and I
really DID like it. She hadn't a headache
and wasn't ill, for I asked her about that, too.
In fact, I gave more attention to Margaret
than to any of the other girls because her
attitude has worried me all afternoon."
Understanding shone in Marjorie May's
mother's eyes as she said, "I am very glad
you mentioned Margaret's attitude tO'day,


for it gives me an opportunity to talk about
something which has long been on my mind.
Come, dear, let us go up to ray room, where
we can have a chat without being disturbed.
“Before I explain to you about Margaret,"
said Marjorie May’s mother, after they were
comfortably seated, "let us talk about the
time when I was a girl of your age. Up until
a very few years ago, mothers and daughters
did not share their secrets and companion*
ship as w T e do now. Mothers and daughters
did not take the car out in the afternoon and
ride into the country as w’e do together.
They did not have swimming races in the
comfortable bathing suits we now use. They
never played tennis together. My goodness 1
I can hardly believe that years ago you and
I w’ould have lived such entirely different
lives."
"But surely," interposed Marjorie May,
"mothers and daughters loved each other in
those days."
“Yes, darling, indeed they did —but when
I a young girl mothers always felt so
much older than their twelve*year*old chil*
dren that they missed the close companion*
ship which we two have.


“And when I was your age,” resumed
Marjorie May’s mother, “there were many
important things that a girl of twelve should
have been told, but which mothers, because
of their lack of intimacy with their daughters,
did not feel free to discuss. Take for instance
Margaret’s attitude at your party. You asked
why she appeared to be quiet and different
tO'day. Well, tO'day for the first time in
Margaret’s life, Nature is beginning within
her a new method of purification.
“Let me explain:
“I wonder if you remember how, when you
were younger, one of the many questions you
asked me was why I always insisted that you
go to the bathroom regularly? I told you
that when the foods and liquids you eat and
drink have served their purpose, and the vita'
mins and other important properties have
nourished you, it is necessary for your
health’s sake that every day the part that your
system does not need shall be eliminated.
On the few occasions you missed going, you
felt very uncomfortable. Mother, when
giving you medicine, explained that your
body, to keep strong and well, must always
be kept free from the unused substances


which Nature casts off. I taught you that
it is just as important for you to be clean
inside as it is to be clean outside.”
Yes, Mother, I remember very well and I
always go regularly, even if I have to leave
whatever I am doing.”
That, dear, is only one of Natures
methods of purifying your body,” Marjorie
May s mother continued, "and you must
always give Nature's demands the first
thought during all of your life.
Now that you are older, Marjorie May,
Nature will soon require an additional means
of purification, so listen carefully while I tell
how it will come to you.
During the past two years you have
grown inches taller, and your body has
rounded itself out. Indeed, you have noticed
that Daddy and I often speak of you as our
Young lady,” for that is what you have
grown to be. I can scarcely realize how fast
you have developed, especially during the
last twelve months. It is only a few weeks
ago th it I sent two of your last year's dresses
to Cousin Alice in the country because you
had outgrown them.


“Now, then, in sending you this new
physical development, Nature simply finds it
necessary to purify your system through a
different outlet. I say purify, but there is
nothing unclean or impure in this natural
process. I have never told you about it
before, but it is a purification (generally
called menstruation) which Mother and all
women and girls attend to for a few days
each month from the time they are about
twelve years of age up to when they are
about forty-five.
“One of these days, at any hour of the
morning or even in the middle of the night,
you will find coming from you a slightly
blood-stained fluid. When you see it, do not
be afraid or worried, for this is the first
indication that the new purification has
started. When it happens, you are to take
from your dresser one of these Kotex pads
and wear it with this elastic girdle, known
as a sanitary belt. On the first day when
this new purification comes, you must tell
me, so that I can see to it that you have a
box of these little pads for your own exclu-
sive use.
“At the beginning, you may be able to


wear the same pad for several hours. Later,
as you grow older, you will change pads
about four times a day, but never allow the
pad to become too saturated with moisture,
otherwise it will feel extremely uncomfort'
able and unpleasant.
“I am going to leave this box of Kotex
with you, but before you use the first pad,
read the direction sheet carefully, for it
shows how the used pad is disposed of at the
time you are changing to a fresh one."
Marjorie May again interrupted: "But
Mother, how am I going to know when it
is going to come again?"
"I am glad you asked that question," said
Marjorie May’s mother, "but before I ex'
plain, run to your room and bring the little
calendar you keep in your dresser."
Delighted to have these new mysteries so
thoroughly explained. Marjorie May fairly
flew to her room, and in w’hat seemed to be
less than a second, returned with the calendar.
"Supposing," said Marjorie May’s mother,
"the new purification started on August 12th.
In that case we would draw a line through
that date like this," and Mother marked the
calendar as follows:

“Now, dear, menstruation, or purification,
generally returns every 28 days, counting the
date it last started as day number one. There'
fore, when we take August 12th as a day
number one, and count 28, what date do
we arrive at?”
Marjorie May, counting each day, then
said “September Bth.”
“That is right/’ said Mother, “so on the
September calendar we put a circle on the
September Bth date, like this.”

“Now, dear, if you should have a minor
illness at this time, it may come a day or so
earlier or later and of course you will always
mark the calendar on the day it actually
starts. If it comes promptly on the Bth of
September, you will mark the usual line
through the date, and your calendar will
look like this."
“It is important that you keep an accurate
record on your own personal calendar so that
you will know to have some Kotex pads and
the girdle with you at school, or wherever
you arc. Then, too, if the purification should
persist in coming much earlier or later than
every 28 days, you will want to tell me so
we can ask the doctor about the matter.
“Some girls who have not been correctly
informed, will tell you dreadful things about


menstruation (the medical word for Nature's
purification), but do not pay any attention to
ideas and superstitions which you may hear
from time to time. There is nothing mys'
terious about menstruation and you must
trust no advice unless a sensible scientific
reason can be given for it.
"Not long ago one of these harmful super'
stitions advised against bathing during men'
struation, but doctors assure us there is no
harm in bathing. Indeed, cleanliness is more
needed at this time than at any other.
Always take a warm soap bath, but never a
cold, and never a hot bath. And —by all
means —every time you change the Kotex
pad, you must wash that part of your body
very thoroughly.
"Some exercise, such as brisk walking and
setting up exercises, are good for girls during
the menstrual period, but doctors think it is
harmful, during this time, to play hard games,
where there is much excitement and compe'
tition. So, Marjorie May, while you are to
continue about your work, play and studies,
you will take things a little easier during
those days.
"That is all, darling, and now you know


that Margaret was different today because it
was for her the first day of the new purifica-
tion. It was such a new event that she
naturally felt like being quiet."
Mother, said Marjorie May, “you are
wonderful to have told me about this new
experience I am soon to have. I shall feel
quite a young lady when the new purification
comes, because it will mean that I have
grown up."
“Yes, dear, but come, let us put every'
thing away and then walk out to the gate
and look for Daddy. He will soon be home,
and surely there will be a present for your
birthday."
