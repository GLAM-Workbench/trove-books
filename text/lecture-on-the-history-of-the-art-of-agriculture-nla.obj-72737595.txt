Ladies and Gentlemen,
Agriculture (the history of which I have selected to address
you on this evening), is an occupation which may justly lie
ennobled with the title of * ?the parent of most of the numerous
subdivisions of employment which call forth the industry of civil-
ised man, or elicit the skilful application of inventive genius,? the
foundation and groundwork of manufactures, ? since the produc-
tions of nature are the materials of art,? the laborious exertions of
the Agriculturist supply those^crscfatcommodities which relieve
the demands of our natural exigencies, gratify those calls which
are collateral and adventitious, and indulge those desires which
ideas of comfort have created, as well as those generated by
luxury.
'l&k.
It is from the connexion which exists between this useful art,
and many of the highest branches of mechanical science, by which
its various operations are .assisted and expedited, as well as by
which its products are with wonderfully greater facility than by
ordinary means reduced from the raw material and rendered avail-
able to suit the wants and wishes of mankind, that the subject of
Agriculture appeared to me well calculated for a lecture before
this institution : and while I lamented my want of practical
acquaintance with the subject as it relates to this country, I con-
soled myself with the hope that, were I to deliver a brief outline
of the History of the Art, with occasional deductions in the course
of it, I might meet the indulgence of the members, and perhaps
have the good fortune to draw the attention of some one present
to instruct the community on this most useful of arts at some
future period, with a lecture more deserving of your favourable
consideration.
The investigation of this subject naturally leads us to the con-
templation of man, in the unsophisticated state of primeval sim-
plicity. His desires limited to the gratification of the cravings of
nature, his wants few, his wishes simple, bis enjoyments partaking
rather of a passive than active character, his early history would

present us with little to afford either interest or instruction, were it
not that within his mortal frame was lodged a particle of that
divine spirit which released him from communion with the beasts
of the field ; established his undisputed sovereignty over them;
stimulated him to efforts which developed the inexhaustable
resources of his fertile imagination, and finally, elevated him to
that glorious eminence from which he can look downwards with
satisfaction on creation as subservient to his will and conducive to
his happiness, and upwards to his Creator with lowly aspirations
of thanksgiving and praise.
It is to present the astonishing contrast between man in his
original condition^^
? When 4rst in woods the noble savage ran,?
and in the advanced state of refinement to which he has arrived, that
I have ventured to commence at so early a period, and also, because
it will enable me to show that Agriculture is entitled to respect, as
having first aroused the human intellect to declare itself, and as
having encouraged man to apply his abilities to the accomplish-
ment of other purposes, which gradually led to the achievement
of such enterprises in discovery and invention as render him in
reality ? the greatest wonder of nature.?
Following then the records of creation given in the Bible, we
are furnished with distinct evidence that one of the objects which
the Deity had in contemplation in forming man was, that he
should apply himself to the cultivation of the earth ; for we find
* ? These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created, in the day that the Lord God created the earth, and
the heavens ; And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,
and every herb of the field before it grew ; for the Lord God had
not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to
till the ground .? Here, you observe, before it pleased the
Creator to express an intention of supplying a population for the
world which had issued fresh from the mould of his Almighty
fiat, the employment of the man who was to be created, is ex-
pressly designated.
And as the earth had not at that period received the anathema
f ? Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and
thou shall eat the herb of the field ; in the sweat of thy face shall
thou eat bread,? still a duty is by anticipation imposed on man,
wisely and kindly imposed ; .that a moderate proportion of labor
should regulate his health, stimulate his appetite, impart a relish
for his food, ensure refreshing slumber, and rescue him from that
? Gen. c. ii., v. 4, 5.
f Gen. c hi., v. 8, 18 and 19.


listless state of inactivity consequent on a total absence of employ-
ment.
It having been decreed that man was to enjoy the pre-emin-
ence over other animals, and to walk forth amidst the domains of
nature as ? lord of the creation,? the structure of his frame and
the peculiar adaptation of the limbs and members of his body, are
admirably calculated to enable him, under the guidance of su-
perior intellect, to derive means of subsistence from the labour of
his hands, to reduce several of the brute creation to a state of
obedience to his will in furtherance of it, and thus to render him
independent of the precarious and uncertain modes of existence:
afforded by the chase, or of relying on the gratuitous productions of
the earth. The latter peaceful and tranquil mode of supporting
life seems, however, to have been preferred to the former by our
first parents. Placed in a garden, abounding with every variety
of fruit-bearing trees, they preferred the quiet task of preparing for
their daily meal by selecting the ripest and most inviting of the
productions around them. To them, while a supply of food was
abundantly afforded by the liberal hand of nature, a course of toil-
some labor was unnecessary ; and we may suppose that the pri-
mitive cultivator was called on for little more than to protect
those choice trees which supplied him spontaneously, to restrain
their luxuriance, or to foster their growth.
In fact, the offices of the first man are particularly mentioned,
when we read that * ? the Lord God took the man and put him into
the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.? This simple
duty, while in a state of innocence, is with infinite grace described
by Milton ; where, after pouring forth their orisons,
? More tuneable than needed lute or harp.
To add more sweetness.?
Adam and his partner Eve go forth to the labours of the day.
? On to their morning?s rural work they haste
? Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row
? Of fruit trees over woody reach?d too far
? Their pamper?d boughs, and needed hands to check,
? Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine
? To wed her elm ; she spous?d about him twines
? Her marriageable arms, and with her brings
? Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn
? Ilis barren leaves.?f
It may not be out of place to observe, that the exact situation
of the Garden of Eden has not been decided on, although its topo-
graphical features are so clearly defined in the Bible ; and the
* Gen. 11. v. Id. f Paradise Lost, lib. v. 1. 211.


commentators adhering to the circumstance of there being a river
parted into four heads, have assigned to it various geographical
positions.
Sir Walter Raleigh, in his History of the World, (principally
composed during his long imprisonment in the tower, from 1603
to 1618), has collected the authorities and enumerated the several
sites, as handed down by remote traditionary testimony, or
?elected by the speculation of antiquarians.
The neighbourhood of Mount Ararat, and different districts of
Mesopotamia, Persia and Arabia, have each, in their turn, been fixed
upon ; and, while the fertility of the soil, the serenity of the cli-
mate, and the abundance of fruit-bearing trees, have induced some
to place it in the vicinity of Damascus ; the Mahomedan asserts
that Paradise was in the Isle of Topobrana or Serendib, our Ceylon;
the Indian, on the other hand, has liberally allowed a fifth river
to water the Garden, and placed it in the Punjaub.
Muller again has supposed that the cradle of the human race
seems to be that place where bread corn, the universal food of
mankind (as he assumes it to be), indigenous ; and he quotes
* Theophrastus, the eloquent disciple of Aristotle, who says that
barley grows wild in the high lands behind the Caspian Sea.
A pupil of Linaeus, he also adds, in his travels to collect ma-
terials and specimens for that great naturalist, coroborates this
testimony ; but, he says that he also found corn growing wild in
Bashkiria, Kashmere, and Thibet, and, that in the north of
China, it grows many years without sowing or tillage.
But, in adducing instances of so many countries in which corn
is indigenous, Muller appears to have proved too much; and to
have perplexed rather than established his position : nor, unless
we suppose the grain to have been eaten raw, or perhaps parched,
do I lean to the opinion that man, in the earliest generations,
advanced to such ingenuity as to be acquainted with the mode of
* Theophrastus was a native of Eresus, in Lesbos : his original name
was Tyrtamus. Aristotle made him change it to Euphrastus, and after-
wards to Theophrastus, to denote his excellent choice of language. When
the disciples of Aristotle were anxious to ascertain which of them he wished
to be his successor, and entreated him shortly before his death to appoint
one whom they should follow, he was perplexed, and found a difficulty
whether to name Theophrastus or Eudemus, or Mencdemus of Ehodes.
After some hesitation, he called for Lesbian and Ehodian wine, and
having tasted each, ho said ? hath are indeed excellent, hut I prefer the
Lesbian.?
They concluded from this expression, that his leaning was in fa' oui of
Theophrastus.


preparing corn for food, by the tedious process of beating it out
of the husk, and grinding or triturating it into meal qr flour. It
is moreover a manifest assumption of the question to say that com
was the food of the first man ; for * iElian describing the most
ancient food of the several nations he treats of, reports that in
Argos they feed chiefly on pears, in Attica on figs, in Arcadia on
acorns, whence the Arcadians were called by Lycophron Balane-
fagoi, or acorn eaters ; and trees which bore acorns or masts, were
in general termed Fagoi from Fago, to eat, (hence tire Latin Fagus
a beech) ; as in Latin ? Esculi ? from Esca food.
Adelung (cited in Mr Lawrence?s Lectures), puts the matter
in a newer and broader light, he says?
As nature would not unnecessarily expose her first-born and
unexperienced son to conflicts and dangers, the place of his early
abode would be so selected that all his wants would be easily
satisfied, and everything essential to the pleasure of his existence
readily procured ; he would be, in short, placed in a Paradise.
Such a country is found in Central Asia, between the 30� and
60' 1 W. L. and 90� and 110� E. L. from Ferro, a spot which, in
respect to height, can only be compared to the lofty Plain of
Quito, in South America. From this elevation, of which the
great ?desert of Gobi or Shamo is the vertical point, Asia sinks
gradually towards all the four quarters. The great chains of
mountain running in various directions arise from it, and contain
the source of the great rivers which traverse this division of the
globe on all sides. The Sclunga, the Obi, the Lena, the Irtish,
and the Yenisei, on the north ; the Jaik, the Jihon, the Jemba,
on the west ; the Amuer, the Hoang Ho on the cast ; the Indus,
Ganges, and Burhampooter, on the south.
If, he says, the globe were ever covered with water, this great
table land must have first become dry, and have appeared like an
island in the watery expanse. The cold and barren desert of Gobi
would not indeed have been a suitable abode for the first people ;
but, on its southern declivity, we find Thibet, separated by high
mountains from the rest of the world, and containing, within its
boundaries, all varieties of air and climate. If severe cold
prevailed on its snowy mountains and glaciers, a perpetual sum-
mer reigns in its valleys and well watered plains.
This is the native abode of rice, the vine, pulse, fruit, and all
other vegetable productions from which man draws his nourish-
ment. Here, too, all the animals are found wild, which man has
tamed for his use, and carried with him over the whole earth :
* Yar. Hist. lih. 3., chap. 39.


The cow, horse, ass, sheep, goat, camel, pig, dog, cat, and even
the servicable rein-deer, his only attendant and friend in the very
deserts of the frozen polar regions.
Close to Thibet, and just on the declivity of the great cen-
tral elevation, we find the charming region of Kashmere, where
great elevation converts the southern heat into perpetual spring,
and where nature has exerted all her powers to produce plants,
animals, and man, in the greatest perfection. No spot on the
whole earth unites so advantages. In none could the
human plant have succeed so well without any care. This spot
therefore, seems to unite all the characters of Paradise, and to be
the most appropriate situation in Asia for the birth-place ot the
human race.
I will conclude this digression by reminding you of the descrip-
tion by Milton of the arrival of Satan in Paradise, for the purpose
of working the fall of our first parents.
* ?Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard
? Mount Amara, though this hy some supposed
? True Paradise, under the Ethiop line
? By Nillus head, enclos?d with shining rock,
? A whole days journey high; hut wide remote
? From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend
? Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind
? Of living creatures, new to sight and strange.?
And again?
? For blissful Paradise,
Of God the garden was, hy him in th? east
Of Eden planted ; Eden stretch?d her line
From Auran eastward to the royal towers
Of great Scleucia, built hy Grecian kings,
Or where the sons of Eden long before
Dwelt in Telassar : in this pleasant soil
His far more pleasant garden God ordain?d.?
In the absence of direct testimony, conjecture or probability
can be our only guide. However, it seems probable to me at
least, that the first Agricultural operations of man were confined
to delving in the ground, for such roots as curiosity or hunger
prompted him to taste, or such as he may have beheld to be the
favourite repast of some animal, and consequently judged to be
innocuous.
We learn that, at a very early period, there appears to have
been a distribution of the rural operations. The pastoral and

.agricultural duties were severally adopted by the two sons of
Adam. Cain is described in general terms to have been ? a tiller
of the ground ? while Abel collected a flock of the most inof-
fensive of quadrupeds, and domesticated the docile sheep.
After the succesion of about six generations, we arrive at the name
of Jabal, ? who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of
such as have cattle.? Thus, we observe the progressive advance-
ment of man in his social condition?his flocks and herds supplied
him with milk curds, and whey, and the occasional sacrifice of
a lamb, a kid, or calf, in addition to the fruits and pulse afforded
as the liberal donation of nature furnished him with the means of
subsistence. And, singular to say, in those regions of the east in-
habited by the nomadic tribes of Arabs, Kurds, and Turcomans,
at this day, human life is supported without any greater exertion.
His raiment was composed of the skins of his sheep, and after
some ages, their fleeces were made to serve that purpose. His
tent we may suppose to have been formed of the hides of his
cattle; and being now sheltered from the inclemency of the
seasons, and above the demands of actual want, his restless mind
suggested several experiments to afford him additional comforts,
and next to supply him with luxurious superfluities.
It is not a little curious to observe, that the first dawn of me-
chanical ingenuity should have presented' itself in the fabrication
of a musical instrument, invented 'perhaps by a shepherd, to
relieve the tedious hours of his solitary employment: for Jubal,
son of Lamech and Adah, is called ? the father of all such as
handle the harp and organ.? The Greek term organ, signifies
generally, a musical instrument. The first could not have been
very complicated.
After this we are informed that Tubal Cain, son of Lamech and
Zillah, was ?an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron.?
His attention might have been attracted by some one of the metals
in the course of husbandry, when digging rather deeper than
usual into the earth; yet, I apprehend, that mention of brass,
.although it occurs repeatedly in the Bible, * must he an error
of the translators, and it probably should be rendered ?copper,?
of which Pliny enumerated the ?rcgularc? or malleable ?coron-
arium? or plate, and ?caldarium? or cast : for ?brass,? is not a

primitive metal, but an alloy of copper and zinc, united by mix-
ing granulated copper with calajmine, (native carbonate of zinc)
and charcoal; and this would not occur unless we adopt the pos-
sibility of such natural alchemy as is suggested by Milton.
* ? In other part stood one who at the forge
Stood lah?ring two massy clods of iron and brass
Had melted, (whether found where casual fire
Had wasted woods, on mountain or in vale,
Down to the veins of earth, thence gliding hot
To some caves month, or whether washed hy stream
From under ground), the liquid ore he drained
Into fit molds prepared.?
However, we read of the metal in Homer, also translated brass :
the weapons of some of his heroes being made of it, and the im-
aginative antiquarian, General Valiancy, rests one of his argu-
ments for the Carthagenian origin of the Irish people on the
similarity in the form and construction of the brazen swords found
in Ireland and those found on the field of Cannae, the scene of the
memorable battle fought between Hannibal and the Romans,
n. c. 216.
With respect to iron, it is not unworthy of remark, that the
Peruvians, amongst the most skilful aboriginal people on either
Continent of America, Avere unacquainted with its use, although
the ore abounds in their country ; and, while gold and silver,
with various alloys, were applied by them to the most ordinary
purposes. They adapted stone and copper to the fabrication
of tools in common use ; and by a very remarkable combina-
tion of copper and tin, in the proportion [according to Humboldt,
who analysed some metalic implements, found in a silver mine,
opened by the Incas , near Cuzco] of, copper, 0.94, tin, 0.6,
they gave a hardness to the metal little inferior to steel, and
were able to licav porphry, granite and the most durable marble.
Iron requires a tedious and ingenious process of smelting to
reduce it from the ore, ?a knowledge of which is not easily ac-
quired by savage nations, whose usual substitutes are flint,
quartz, obsidian, the Nephritic stone called jade, or the Avood of
some tree peculiar in its compactness; and it may be doubted
whether mankind Avas not for some time acquainted with the
familiar use of other metals before they acquired a knowledge of
iron.
* Paradise Lost.?Lib xi. v. .564.


Lucretius* bears testimony to this ; and Ovid f in his poetical
and metamorphical arrangement of the metallic eras, place that of
iron last.
Before I proceed further, it may be well to observe, that we
owe to the Art of Agriculture another proud distinction, that of
having originated the ideas of the ? rights of property.?
For the earth, and all things therein, were, in the first instance,
declared to be the general property of all mankind, exclusive of
all other beings ; and, while the human family was confined to
but few individuals, each took from the public stock to his own
use without molestation such things as his necessities required.
These general notions of property were then sufficent to answer
all the purposes of a primitive society ; and had the human race
continued in a state of such simplicity, would have continued to
be sufficient.
The ground being in common, no part was the permanent pro-
perty of any person in particular.
Whoever was in the occupation of any determined spot for rest,
shade, or any other purpose, acquired for the time a sort of owner-
ship therein, from which it would have been contrary to the law
of nature to have dislodged him : But the right of possession
lasted only as long as the act of possession continued ; for the
instant he quitted the use or occupation of the soil, another
might seize it without injustice.
Thus, also, a vine or other tree might be said to be in common,
as all men were equally entitled to its produce ; yet, any indi-
vidual, were he to gather the fruit for his own repast, might gain
by the exercise of the labour exclusive property in the fruit.
When mankind increased in number, craft, and ambition, it
became necessary to entertain conceptions of more permanent
dominion, and to appropriate to individuals, not only the use but
the very substance of the thing to be used, otherwise innumerable
contentions must have arisen, and the good order of society would
have been continually disturbed, while various persons contend-
ed who should get the first occupation of the same thing, or
disputed who had actually gained it. The article of food was the
most immediate call, and therefore demanded the earliest con-
sideration ; and the bodily labour expended on any thing, before
* Posterius Ferri vis est, ferisquc reperta ;
Et prior sens erat quam Ferri cognitus usus:
Quo facilis magis est natura et copia major.

f De duro est ultima ferro.
Ovid Met.?Lib 1. l. 127.


the common property of mankind, was allowed to give the most
reasonable title to an exclusive property therein. The patri-
archial system having been established, in addition to the perma-
nent property vested in flocks and herds, that of tents, household
furniture, and implements of husbandry, having become clearly
defined and distinctly understood ; ideas of permanent property in
the substantial soil itself, strengthened by an uninterrupted oc-
cupancy for a period of time, begun by usage to ripen into an
established right. The support of cattle made the article of water
a very important point, deficient in many regions of Asia, as well
as we unfortunately know it to be in some parts of this country ;
and as in districts where pasturage was abundant, a supply of that
necessary was at times inadequate, people were compelled to dig
wells, ?a practice well worthy of imitation here ; which act con-
firmed the exclusive property in the digger or occupier, and about
which the Bible gives us numerous instances of strife.
I may here paranthetically allude to some of the wise regula-
tions of Solon, the Athenian lawgiver, on this subject ; who, to
prevent disputes about water, which was very scarce in some parts
of Attica, ordained; that if there be a public well within the distance
of an Hippicum or length of an horse course, any person might
make use of it ; if not, every person should dig one for himself.
If a man dug a well near the ground of another, he should have a
space of 4 feet between it and his neighbours enclosure ; and if in
sinking, he went 60 feet without finding water, he was allowed to
draw twice a day from his neighbours well, six pitchers of water.
To return, while, as by degrees the world became more popu-
lous, and as by constantly occupying the same places, the fruits
of the earth were consumed, and its spontaneous produce was
destroyed without any provision for a future supply or a regular
succession, the Art of Agriculture was, by the necessity of the
case, produced, or at least, promoted and encouraged ; which, by
a regular connection and consequence, introduced and established
the idea of a more permanent property in the soil than had hither-
to been received and adopted.
It was clear that the earth would not produce her fruits in
sufficient quantities, without the assistance of tillage, but who
would be at the pains of cultivating it if he were liable to be de-
spoiled of the produce of his industry, art, and labour, by the
stronger hand of another too indolent to toil for himself, but
sufficiently daring to commit such an act of injustice 1 The de-
velopment of Agriculture having then begotten and clearly esta-
blished the right of property in ?land,? mankind soon perceived
the superiority of a fixed and stationary condition of life, over
that of wanderers upon the face of the earth, and recourse was had


consequently to civil society, which brought with it a lengthened
train of inseparable concomitants, consisting in the words of
Blackstone of ?states, governments, laws, punishments, and
the exercise of religious duties.? Thus connected together, it
was found that a part only of society was sufficient to provide
by their manual labour for the necessary subsistence of all, and
leisure was afforded to others to cultivate the human mind, to
i nvent useful arts, and to lay the foundations of science.
Agriculture docs not however appear to have advanced at first
universally, in a ratio proportionate to the increase of population:
Nor were the arts of industry applied in general with a perse-
verance equivalent to the demands made on them ; for we find
at an early period of sacred history, at the time of the departure
of Abram from the land of Haran, *?that there was a famine in
the land of Cannan,? which compelled him to continue his migra-
tion to Egypt; which country, even then seems to have produced
more corn than was necessary for the consumption of its in-
habitants.
The fructifying properties of the waters of the river Nile, were
duly estimated by this active people ; and as a shower of rain
rarely falls in the serene climate of Egypt, they religiously im-
puted the rise of the stream [in reality caused by the tropical
rains in Ethiopia,(] to the benignant influence of their god Scrap is.
In his temple, at Memphis, was erected a pillar, on which
were inserted daily during the period of the overflow the degrees
of its increase, which were promulgated with great solemnity
throughout Egypt. The inhabitants of the provinces were by
that means made acquainted beforehand with what they might
fear or hope from the ensuing harvest. The Emperor Constantine,
removed this pillar from the temple of Serapis to the Church of
Alexandria, when the superstitious people were filled with appre-
hension that the river would not again overflow its banks.
Julian, the apostate, a zealous supporter of idolatry, caused
the pillar to be restored to the citizens of Memphis ; but it
was again removed by command of the Emperor Theodosius.
Strabo speaks of a well on the banks of the river, near the
town of Syene,f made for marking the rise of the waters of the river;
*Gen. chap. xii. v. y. 4 10. B.C. 1921.
f Memorable in history not merely tor its marble, but that the
satirist Juvenal was in the eightieth year of his age ordered to proceed
there to take command of a Proetorian- Cohort.
For this petnlent instance of ? Sell or Sail ? on the part of the Roman
? Horse Guards,? his 16th Satire is (notwithstanding the doubts of Gibbon
and others) a telling Riposte.


and, during the last century, the rise of the waters was regularly
proclaimed in the principal mosque, at Cairo ; and the tribute
paid to the Grand Signor was graduated by the height and extent
of the inundation.
Shakspearc alludes to the fluctuation of this remarkable river,
in a manner which illustrates his universal knowledge, and the
art with which, by the introduction of topics of local importance
or peculiarity he invests his dramas, the scene ot which is laid in
foreign countries, with an additional air ot reality.

The fruitfulness of Egypt, was of old and still is proverbial ;
and is to be attributed altogether to the inundations of the Nile ;
for, as other streams when they overflow, wash away and exhaust
the vivific strength and moisture of the soil, or in the nervous
words of Seneca, ? eviscerate ? it, the Nile does not devour or
brush off any of the useful material, but, on the contrary, fattens
and enriches it in such a manner as sufficiently compensates for
what the proceeding harvest has impaired.
One of the greatest instances of the useful application of indus-
try ever presented by man to an admiring posterity, is to be
viewed in the lake Moeris, which was considered the noblest of all
the wonderful works of the kings of Egypt. Its laudible object
being to advance the cause of Agriculture, renders it infinitely
better worthy the attention of the friend of humanity than the
enormous Pyramids, styled by Pliny * ?the idle and foolish osten-
tation of the wealth of the Egyptian kings.? _ '
As the too general flow or ebb of the waters of the Nile proved
equally injurious to the land inundated by it, King Moeris, to
remedy this inconvenience, and to correct the irregularities of the
flood, called art to the assistance of nature, and caused the lake to
be dug, which was afterwards distinguished by the name of the
monarch. Authors differ as to the extent of this artificial piece
of water. Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and Pliny, gravely
assert, that it was not less than 160 or 180 miles in circumferance;
* Lib. 36. cap. 12.


even taking the moie moderate account of Pomponius Mela,
it appears to have been about 20 miles round. The communica-
tion with the river was kept up by a canal, 4 leagues in length,
and 50 feet in width. Great sluices opened or shut the canal or
lake, when occasion required ; and when the river rose too high,
and its rising was likely to be attended with fatal consequences, its
waters were admitted to the lake. On the other hand, when the
inundation was insufficient and threatened a scarcity, Water was
furnished by the lake being permitted to empty itself by nu-
merous canals.
Strabo says that when Petronius was Governor of Egypt, it was
calculated that when the Nile rose 12 cubits, a great plenty ensued ;
when it rose only to 8, the dearth was scarcely felt, as the waters
of the lake Moeris supplied the deficiency of the river.
Another work of extensive importance to Agriculture was exe-
cuted by the Emperor Galcrius. He discharged the superfluous
waters of the lake Pelso into the Danube, and, by cutting down
immense forests, opened a large and fertile district to his Pan-

The learned and critical Gibbon, throws some doubt on the
account of this work, given by Aurelius Victor, * in consequence
of what he considers to be a geographical inaccuracy, and he suspects
that lake Pelso has been confounded with the Yolocean marshes,
now called Jake Sabaton, which were situated in the province of
Valeria, ?a name which the wife of Valerius gave to the drained
country lying betw ecn the Drave and the Danube; although he
does not deny the fact of such an undertaking.
It is also worthy of recollection, that the useful and virtuous
Emperor Probus lost his life by the hands of his soldiers, who he
Imprudently urged with great severity to complete the unwholesome
labour of draining in the midst of summer the marshes of Sirmium,
in Pannonia ; impatient of fatigue, they grasped their arms and
broke out into a furious mutiny.f
The blessings of an abundant harvest and plentiful increase, arc
frequently represented in Holy Writ, as the reward of the righteous;
but wc are not to suppose that these advantages occurred to them
without having been earned by industry and laborious exertion ?
and, indeed, in some parts of the east, which we know to have
been extremely populous in ancient times, it must have required
no ordinary pains and attention 4o make the soil productive.
For Clarke, in his travels, says, that the country in the vicinity
-of Jerusalem, is rocky, and apparently sterile, as Strabo repre-

scuts it, and is now in general perfectly barren. However, the
sides of the most unproductive mountains in that part of Judea
had formerly been rendered fertile by being divided into terraces,
described by General Stratton as resembling the gradus or rows
in a theatre ; on which soil had been accumulated with astonish-
ing labour: and, as in J udea, the influence of the sun is often
severely felt, as in this country, (being in about a corresponding
latitude with the northern portion of the colony of New South
Wales), the landscape, according to Burckhardt, presents almost
always a dusty appearance, and the grass is parched and withered
up ; but there are still to be seen in many parts of Syria, and with-
in the limits of ancient Judea, the remains of large cisterns or
tanks, some hewn out of the solid rock, in which the rain water
was collected ; and traces of canals are still to be observed, by
which those waters were distributed on the fields.
Such labours necessarily created a prodgious fertility under an
ardent sun, where moisture was the only requisite to revive l
the vegetable world ; and by the means of irrigation, vegetation
was perpetually maintained, and made to produce an uninterrupted
succession of flowers and fruits.
The value of irrigation was also fully appreciated in Persia and
upper India, where canals of great length constructed by
former princes, conveyed water in abundance to provinces
before uncultivated in consequence of the aridity of the soil. It fur-
thermore proved a source of revenue to the Princes, who sold the
water to the inhabitants of the district through which the canal
passed; flood gates, at certain stations, admitted a supply to private
aqueducts, which again fed smaller streams, the contents of
which dispersed themselves over the thirsty fields.
That similar results might be arrived at in many parts of this
country with similar success, I see no reason to doubt; and I feel
convinced no tax would be more cheerfully paid by an industrious
population, than one for which they received so valuable an
equivalent as that which fertilized their soil, rendered them inde-
pendent of an unpropitious season, and enabled them to rely with
certainty on a profitable return for their outlay. And, if Louis
the XIV. of France, in the magnificence of his luxury, could raise,
by hydraulic machinery, of enormous power, the waters from the
bed of the Seine, to a height which enabled them to flow on a
stupendous aqueduct, to supply his jets d?eaux at Versailles, and
thereby afford us subject for astonishment and admiration ; how
much more noble and worthy of applause should we not con-
sider a similar undertaking ; which, instead of creating in our


blinds a regret that the perfection of art had been employed in a
purpose so little to the benefit of society, would call forth emo-
tions of the most gratifying and exalting description in beholding
art directed to its legitimate end?the amelioration of the condition
of man, and the victory of science over nature !
Amongst the Ancients, Agriculture was held in high estimation ;
and the noblest Poets did not consider rural and pastoral affairs
beneath the dignity of the Muse.
The Elusinian mysteries, the most sacred and solemn of Pagan
religious festivals, were celebrated in honour of Ceres, the goddess
of corn and harvests, who was supposed to have instructed
Triptolemus, king of Attica, in the Art of Agriculture.
The Cerealia, or Ludi Cerealis, which corresponded with the
Thesmophoria of the Greeks, were held annually at Rome, in the
month of April ; as were also the Isia, in honour of the Egyptian
goddess, Isis. They lasted nine days ; and those who participated
in the ceremonies, carried about vessels filled with wheat and
barley, as to Isis was attributed the having imparted to mankind
a knowledge of the value and mode of cultivating those grains:
and although, in consequence of the licentious conduct of the
people they were abolished by the Senate 'A.U.C.696, they were
introduced anew, by the Emperor Commodus.
Triptolemus, of whom I have just made mention, promulgated
several laws, to regulate and promote Agriculture ; they are enu-
merated by Porphyrins and Hieronymus, one of them displaying the
humane character of the Legislator impressively declares
? Hurt no living animal.?
In the politics of Aristotle, several of the laws of Solon relating
to property and rural affairs are preserved ; by one of them ? Men
are not to be permitted to purchase as much land as they desire,
lest they become too great and powerful.? Another ?forbids the
slaughter of oxen, which labour at the plough, or of lambs, within
two years of age.? This was to encourage the propagation of those
animals ; and for their protection, ? a reward of five drachmas
was offered for the head of a wolf.?
By a law, ascribed to Pisistratus, any man is permitted to
bring a criminal accusation against another for idleness ; which
shows the antiquity of the Vagrant Act: and by another, an ac-
tion of Libel or Slander might be -brought against any person who
disparaged or ridiculed any man or woman for being of a trade.
From a Drama of Aristophanes, ?The Frogs,? it appears that
great encouragement was given at Athens to industiious arti/ans;
for it is mentioned that?


?He who by his profession or calling gets host repute, and is
reckoned most ingenious in his trade, shall have his diet in tho
Prytaneum, and be honoured with the highest seat.?
To protect the Agricultural interest, a corn law, alluded to by
Demosthenes* forbid the sending of money out of the country to
buy corn, unless the introduction of it were permitted by a Decree
of the people ; and the illegal importation of corn subjected the
offender to a trial before the officers of the Custom House,?the
process being similar to what is styled in our legal phraseology, a
? qui tarn ? action, as the informer claimed half the corn. Olives
were exported ; but it was forbidden, except to the Victors at the
Panathenean games, to send all other fruits out ot Attica ; and the
term Sycophant, which, in the English language, bears a very
different meaning, signified in the original, one who informed
against those who exported figs.f
Hesiod, who flourished about b.c. 1000, the most ancient Greek
author, whose writings are now extant,, has afforded in his-
? Works and Days,? written about the age of King Solomon, in-
structions to the husbandman, shepherd, and herdsman, and also
rules for the management of the vine and the olive, illustrating
them with rural descriptions, and concluding with various reli-
gious precepts.
The divine Homer himself has frequently introduced into his-
Epics familiar representations connected with pastoral and agri-
cultural life, (some indeed of a very homely nature) and in par-
ticular when describing the armour fabricated by Vulcan for
Achilles, he has taken occasion to mention, as delineated on the 1
shield, the several operations of husbandry in succession?plough-
ing, sowing, reaping, the vintage, and tending the flocks and herds*
at large in the pasturage.
In the early ages of the Roman Republic, the Senators, and those-
who filled the highest offices in the State, on leaving Rome, laid
aside the dignity which accompanied their elevated station, and
applied themselves to the cultivation of their farms, actually
assisting their servants in performing the ordinary duties of hus-
bandmen. And we are all familiar with the name of Cincinnatus,,
Dentatus, Fabricius, and Regulus, men taken from the humblest
rural labors, on their little farms, of from four to seven acres, to*
lead armies, assume the office of Dictator, make war, conclude
treaties, and tranquilise the disturbances created by turbulent and
seditious citizens.
In the foremost rank the of Roman authors, we find Virgil^
* In Locritum. t From Sukon Faino,


who, in his four books of Georgies, has entered very minutely
into matters connected with Agriculture ; and while he charms
the ear with the melody of his numbers, and delights the mind
with the richness of his poetic imagery, he enumerates the most
usual indications of a fruitful and productive soil and the reverse;
the ci'ops best adapted to each, with the treatment ot them,
points out the appropriate season for the different rural tasks ;
and lays down rules, some of which as applicable to the climate
of Italy, have not since been improved on.
That the Art of Agriculture was held in high estimation by the
Romans is evident, from the number of writers on the subject ;
among them were Cato, Varro, Cicero, Columella, Vhgil I
have already named, Palladius and Pliny, men distinguished for
eloquence and learning ; and we are told that the works of Mago,
a Carthaginian writer on Agriculture (who produced a Treatise,
in 28 books), were preserved by Scipio at the taking of
and by him presented to the Roman Senate, by whose orders they
were translated into Latin, by Silanus, and several other persons,
skilled in the Punic language; (as they had been previously trans-
lated into Greek, by Cassius Dionysius of Attica) and it is said
that the Romans consulted them with greater avidity than they
did the Sibylline Verses.*
* The history of the Sibylline Books is known; their loss when the
Capitol was burned, in the time of Sylla, is also known. They were
replaced by Sibylline Verses, collected from various Temples in Greece,
which commanded infinite respect until destroyed by Stilicho, about a. d.
390. This act of barbarism is commemorated in the spirited lines of
Rutilius, the poet of Gaul.
?Quo magis est facinus diri Stilichonis acerbum,
Proditor arcani qui fuit imperii.
Romano generi dum nititur esse superstes,
Crudelis summis miscuit ima furor.
Dumque timet, quic quid se fccerat ipse timeri,
Immisit Latise barbara tela neci.
Visceribus nudis arraatum condidit hostem,
Plate cladis liberiore dolo.
Ipsa satellitihus pellitis Roma patebat,
Et Captiva prius, quam caperetur, erat,
Nec tantum Gcticis grassatus proditor armis ;
Ante Sibyllina? fata crcmavit opis.
Odimus Altlweam consumti funere torris :
Niseum crinem here putantur aves :
At Stilicho JEterni fatalia piguora regui;
Et plenas voluit precipitarc coins.
B 3


But another circumstance indicates this, and is in itself not tt
little amusing, which is, that several of the most illustrious
families which Rome pi?oduced, derived their names from the
founders of them having applied themselves to the breeding and
increase of different kinds of animals, or from there having intro-
duced into Italy or cultivated with success various plants and
vegetables. Thus, * Plutarch informs us that the Suilii, the
Bubulci, the Caprarii, and the Porch earned their names, either
from the peculiar skill with which they managed the Sow, the Ox,
the Goat, and the Pig, or from the numbers of them they pos-
sessed : Other authors inform us that the Pisones were so called
from Pisum a pea, the Fabii from Faba a bean, the Lentuli from
Lens, a lentil introduced from Egypt.f Cincinnatus received
the name of Serranus, because the Ambassadors found him em-
ployed in sowing his land when they brought him the intel-
ligence of his having been invested by the Senate with the office
of Dictator.
Cicero, the renowned orator, received the cognomen from Cicer
a vetch, as some say, from the successful culture by him of that
plant, though others affirm it was from his having a wart like a
vetch upon his chin, as the Bth Ptolomy of Egypt was called
Lathyrus from a wart, resembling the seed of the Lathyrus, a kind
of Egyptian pulse, upon his nose. Agricola, a name made celebrated
by the biography of Tacitus, means a husbandman. And even the
derivation of words signifying riches is expressive of the fact
that the first ideas of wealth were deduced from the abundance of
pastoral and agricultural possessions. Thus ?locuples? rich,
comes from ? loci? vel. ?agri plenus? ?pecuniosus? from ? peco-
rum copia,? ?pecunia? from ?pecus,? the coin being originally
stamped with the impression of a sheep.
It may be incidentally remarked, that it was contrary to the
Omnia Tartarei cessent tormenta Neronis,
Consumat Stygias tristior umbra faces.
Hie iramortalem, mortalem perculit file ;
Hie mundi matrem perculit, file suam.
Lines which outweigh all the adulation of Claudian.

Roman laws for a private person to cause his name or figure to
be inscribed on any public monument, or on the coin of the
Commonwealth, ?so Cicero, when iEdilc ordered that instead of
his name in full, the words Marcus Tullius, with the represen-
tation of a vetch should be placed on a public building, erected
during the time he held office ; as Julius Csesar, in the same
spirit, directed that the figure of an elephant should be placed on
the reverse of the public money, which he artificially contrived
as the word Caesar, signifies an elephant in the Punic tongue.
A similar evasion is related of the two Grecian Architects,
Batrachus and Saurus, who erected a temple gratuitously, with
the hope of being permitted to enjoy the honor of perpetuating
their names by having them inscribed upon the building. This
privilege being denied to them, they attached to several parts of
the work, the figures of a frog and a lizard; the words Batrakos
and Saura, signifying those reptiles, corresponded in an equivocal
manner with the names of the designers.
It is also supposed that a similar object was in the view of the
sculptor, who made the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelian
?n which the forelock of the horse represented at a distance the
shape of an owl, the bird sacred to Minerva and the tutelary
Divinity of Athens, to indicate that the artist was an Athenian.
In the early ages of the commonwealth, the relations of landlord
and tenant were not understood ; but as wealth increased, opulent
proprietors let a portion of their land to tenants ; and the first
leases were granted for a Lustrum, or period of five years.
While the laws restricted the possession of land, and while the
citizens themselves cultivated their own farms, the Republic could
boast of and command a race of brave and hardy warriors ; but
when her military operations were conducted on the grand scale
which required several armies in the field at once, in different
countries, Rome was forced to delegate the duties of husbandmen
to slaves, and to depend for a supply both of provision and men
upon the provinces of Sicily, Spain, Gaul, Africa, and Egypt.
As the fortunate termination of successive warn annexed dif-
ferent foreign countries to the Republic, those lovers of Agricul-
ture, immediately on the discovery of any useful trees, plants, or
vegetables, took steps to introduce them to Italy, and to propo-
gate them with due attention ; and as they found them by de-
grees acclimatized, and rendered sufficiently hardy to bear the
higher latitudes, they generously distributed them amongst the
northern provinces. It is thus that most of the flowers, herbs,
and fruits now common in Great Britain are primarily of foreign
extraction; their origin is, in many instances, betrayed by their


names. The apple was a native of Italy, but when the Romans
had tasted the rich flavor of the apricot, peach, nectarine, citron,
orange, and pomegranate, they contented themselves by applying
to all these new fruits, the common denomination of ?apple,?
discriminating them by superadding the additional epithet of their
country, or some peculiar distinctive characteristic; as malum
Armeniacum, Citreum, Persicum, Medicum, Assyrium, Aurea,
i unica. The quince was called Pyrus Cydonia, from Cydonia, a
town in Crete ; the cherry or cerasus, from Cerasus, a city of
Pontus, whence it was transplanted into Italy by Lucullus, B.C-
about 73, and found its way into Britain about 150 years after,
The damson, or more properly the damascene plum, was brought
from the neighbourhood of Damascus ; currants came from Cor-
inth, still called in French u raisins de Gorinthe? and the lucerne or
clover retained the appellation of medica, from a district of Media,
whence it was conveyed into Greece, according to Pliny, during
the wars of Darius, and thence into Italy.
Crambe or colewort, so deadly a rechaufee, according to the
Greek proverb* and the authority of Juvenal, f may be traced in
the Koroumb, the kidney-bean Faselus of Aristophanes |Faselus
of Virgil in the ? Besillchthe caper caparis of Theophrastus
eapparis of Pliny in the ? Kabbar;? and the arum � colocassia of
Virgil Martial Columella and Pliny in the ? Kolgos,? of modern
Egypt.
Flax also was introduced from that country, and cultivated
with success in Gaul ; and the different artificial grasses became
familiar to the farmers of Italy and the provinces, which assured
supply of wholesome and plentiful fodder for the cattle during the
winter, multiplied the flocks and herds, which, in their turn, con-
tributed to enrich the soil.

It may finally be observed, that the advanced state of Agricul-
ture, in the latter period of the Roman History, may he inferred
from the dense population of the capital and provincial cities, and
from the circumstance that famines, so frequently experienced by
the infant Republic, were of rare occurrence ; as the lamentable
effects of deficient harvests were guarded against by experience,
which dictated a judicious system of storing provisions in public
granaries,?an instance of prudent foresight, well worthy of the
attention of our rulers here, where the demands of a progressively
increasing population exceed the supply raised for its support
within the country.
In pursuing this hasty sketch of the History of Agriculture, I
now leave the middle regions of the south, and proceed with the
Romans into Britain. Before their arrival in that island, though
some of its inhabitants lived chiefly by hunting, others had, long
before that period, understood the management of flocks and herds
of domestic animals.
Caesar, in his Commentaries, says that ? the island of Britain
abounded in flocks and herds;* and the greatest number of the
inhabitants never till their lands, but live on flesh and milk, reli-
gious prejudice caused them to abstain from eating hares, fowl, or
geese and Carte, in his History, says that ? many of the antient
British nations are by some supposed to have derived .their names
from the particular kinds of cattle they chiefly tended.? How-
ever, these antient British herdsmen seem to have been ignorant
of some of the most valuable portion of their craft, until they were
instructed by the Romans ; for we have no reason to believe
that they had any knowledge of the art of the emasculation of
cattle for the purpose of meliorating their flesh ; and it is sup-
posed, by one of our most learned antiquaries, that Scribonius,
physician to the Emperor Claudian, was the first who imparted
to them this knowledge; and we are informed by Strabo, that
they were unacquainted with the art of making cheese : although
the Germans knew its use, a�brding to Caesar, f If the testimony
of an antient writer, Geoffry of Monmouth, can be relied on,
the Art of Agriculture must have made greater progress than is
admitted by the Roman Historians; for he says, that by one of

tholaws of Dunwallo * Molmutiiis, who flourished B.C. 500, ?the
ploughs of the husbandman, and the temples of the gods, should be
sanctuaries for such as lied to them.? The antient British husband-
men were not, however, destitute of knowledge of the value of
manures of different kinds, and even employed some unknown to
the Romans themselves, amongst which Pliny enumerates
?marl,? which he calls ?fat clay or earth and he mentions
several descriptions,f of which he considers the white kinds the
fattest and most beneficial. To obtain this, he says, they must
sink shafts an hundred feet deep, and its effects are said to con-
tinue for eighty years. Lime, also, he affirms was occasionally used.
The agricultural implements of our forefathers, at this period,
must have been of course both limited in number and of rude
construction ; but there is some reason to believe that the system
of reaping corn with scythes, attached to the wheels of a cart,
driven by one or more horses, (on a principle similar to that by
which they mowed down their enemies in the field with their war
chariots), was in vogue amongst them.
The politic Romans having subdued, by degrees, the several
British States, endeavored, by various means, to bring their new
subjects to cultivate the lands, in order that their conquests might
thereby be rendered more valuable. They imposed on the van-
quished, a tribute of a certain portion of corn; and by their power
and example so effectually reconciled the Britons to the arts of
cultivation, that, in a short time, the island became one of the
most plentiful provinces of the empire,?a proof of which is
afforded by the historian of the Emperor Julian, who informs us
that J?that Emperor built a fleet of 800 ships upon the Rhine,
larger than the common barks, and sent them to Britain to bring

coni from thence to supply the nations there suffering from fa_

Horticulture was also attended to ; and the Emperor Probus
embraced a great and beneficial plan of replenishing the exhausted
peasantry, ,by introducing colonies of captives, on whom he be-
stowed land, cattle, and instruments of husbandry;* and it is as-
serted, that he transported a considerable body of Vandals into
Britain, and located them, it is supposed, in Cambridgeshire. He
also revoked the imperial prohibition of Domitian, and granted a
general permission of planting vines to the Gauls, Pannonians, and
Britons ; and such advancement did the antient Britons make in
the rural arts, for making the earth yield her most precious gifts
in the greatest abundance, for the support and comfort of human
life, that we have reason to suppose that Provincial Britain was
better cultivated, had better means of communication;f the people
were more comfortably housed ; and that it was in all respects a
more plentiful and agreeable country, while under the Roman
sway, than it was for many centuries after their departure ; at
which time, Gibbon informs us, there were in the island ninety-
two considerable towns, amongst which, thirty-three cities were
distinguished above the rest, by their' superior privileges and

importance ; possessing a legal Corporation, for the purpose Of
regulating their domestic policy, with the powers of Municipal
government distributed amongst annual magistrates, a select
Senate, and the assembly of the people.
In the era following that of Roman authority, we find a sad
declension in the practice of the Art of Agriculture, owing chiefly
to the incursions of Scots, Piets, Saxons, and subsequently of the
Danes, who both interrupted the husbandman in the exercise of
his labours, and also, either carried away or destroyed the fruits
of them.
The long wars which followed the arrival of the Saxons, and
which eventually expelled the Britons from their richest districts,
caused them to forget much of their skill; and amidst the moun-
tains of Wales and the fastnesses of Cornwall, they devoted them-
selves rather to pasturage than to agriculture. This is evident
from the laws promulgated in that time, embodied in a code
called ? Leges Wallioe,? which appointed that fines inflicted, and
even the ? Weregild,? or compensation for men?s lives should be
paid in cattle ; and the great anxiety evinced by these early legis-
lators, for the preservation of the fruits of the earth, appears from
there having been not fewer than eighty-six enactments respect-
ing them.
The Anglo Saxons, a race of proud and restless warriors, con-
sidered the servile offices of Agriculture too ignoble for them; and
when they could no longer procure provisions at the point of the
sword, they deputed the duties of guiding the plough and hand-
ling the spade to their women and slaves.
A melancholy proof of the neglected state of cultivation is
afforded by the frequent and deplorable famines which visited
England from time to time, and swept off vast numbers of its
inhabitants : In the year a. d. 1043, in particular, so great a
scarcity prevailed, that a quarter of wheat sold for sixty Saxon
pence, containing as much silver as fifteen shillings, equivalent to
about 8 1, sterling of our money.
It was by the Monks (to whom we are also indebted for the
preservation of literature and the arts and sciences through the
dreary period of the dark ages), that any traces of the Horticul-
ture of antiquity were preserved in Britain. They planted
orchards, grafted fruit-trees, and cultivated herbs and vegetables,
in gardens attached to their monasteries, which they tilled with
their own hands.
In fact, the protection and encouragement of all concerned in
Agriculture, were objects of peculiar attention to the Church; for
the 26th Canon of the General Council of Lateran, held a. d. 1179,


decrees that ?All presbyters, clerks, monks, converts, pilgrims
and peasants, when engaged in the labors of husbandry, together
with the cattle in their plough, and the seed, which they carry
into the field, shall enjoy perfect security ; and, that all who
molest or interrupt them, if they do not desist when they have been
admonished, shall be excommunicated.? Before this we find that
haughty prelate, Thomas a?Beckett, condescending to go with his
clergy in a body to assist his neighbours in saving their hay and
reaping their corn.
There is no question but that the conquest of England by the
Normans, contributed largely to the improvement of the Art ot
Agriculture ; for, by this event, many thousands of husbandmen
were poured into the country, from Flanders, France, and Nor-
mandy, who settled on the GO,OOO Knight?s Fees, into which
William the I. the kingdom ; and they immediately
applied themselves to the same methods of cultivation they had
practised at home: and thus a second time was England indebted
to her continental neighbours for the introduction or improvement
of this important art.
The writers of this period and of the succeeding century, inci-
dently mention the various operations of. ploughing, sowing, har-
rowing, reaping, thrashing, winnowing, cross-ploughing; and
summer fallowing was a common occurrence amongst the English
farmers, as may be collected from the writings of Gerald Barry,
better known as Giraldus Cambrensis, who accompanied Prince
John to Ireland, a.d. 1184.
William of Malmsbury, who flourished in the 12th century,
states that England abounded with gardens, orchards, and vine-
yards, planted by the Normans; and says that in the Yale of
Gloucestershire wine was made, very little inferior in flavor to the
wines of France. In the following century, a very equitable
regulation was made, as to the collection of the Royal revenue.
It ordained ?that no cattle necessary for the cultivation of the
land should be destrained for the kings dues, or for any other kind
of debt.? Formerly, according to the Black-Book of the Ex-
chequer, the kings of England received neither gold nor silver
from their tenants, but only service or provisions for the house-
hold, and officers appointed to manage the kings land ; which
custom was even continued during the whole of the reign of
William I.
This is borne out by the derivation of the word farm, as given
us by Mr. Justice Blackstone.* It is deduced, he says, from the
* 81. Com. vol. ii. p. 318.


Saxon ?Fcorme,? which signifies ?provisions,? and it came to bd
used instead of rent or render , because antiently the greatest part
of rents were reserved in provisions, in corn, in poultry and the like,
till the use of money became more frequent; so that a farmer ?fir-
marius,? was one who held his land on payment of a ?rent? or
?fcorme,? though at present by a gradual departure from the
original sense, the word ? farm? is brought to signify the very
estate or lands so held upon farm or rent.
It is nevertheless a subject for melancholy reflection, that, though
the foregoing alteration is adduced as an instance of the increased
attention paid to Agriculture, the rights of the subject should have
been so little understood at this period ; for when Henry 111. was
declared of age, and on that occasion ratified the great charter
which had been wrung from his father at Runny mead, no other
notice is taken of that useful class of society, the husbandmen
than, that ?guardians are prohibited from committing destruc-
tion and waste of the men and goods of their wards.?
Nothwithstanding the progressive improvements in Agriculture,
some very severe famines were felt. They were partly owing to
the dreadful devastation of war ; and some are attributed to pro-
digious rains and floods, against which no skill or industry can
guard. One which occured in a.d. 1257, is ascribed to Richard,
Earl of Cornwall, having drained (if wc may credit some antient
authors), no less a sum than 700,000 marks out of England, in
order to bribe the German Electors, to elevate him to the imperial
throne.
An anonymous work called Fleta, composed, it is imagined, by
a lawyer confined in Fleet Prison, (whence the name) contains,
amongst other topics, complete instructions in Agriculture and
Horticulture, and sets forth the duties of a steward or bailiff of a
manor. *

stances of the country, and the manners of its inhabitants, were

That the accounts of English farmers should have been kept in Latin in
the 13th Century seems strange; and such Latin! hut a specimen may
amuse.

Unfavorable to the Art of Agriculture, and it will be found to have
made but little progress.
War almost constantly diverted the attention of the people, and
particularly the nobility, from the improvement of their lands.
A taste for this art was even considered dishonorable and plebeian;
and King Edward 11. was bitterly reproached, as well as much
despised, for his attachment to it and neglect of military exercises.
This again gave rise, as may be naturally expected, to several
destructive famines ; in one of which it is computed by Mathew
Paris, that not fewer than 15,000 people perished, in London
alone ; and the making of malt and brewing beer, were prohibited
by Royal proclamation. It was impossible, however, to expect
that Agriculture could flourish, when those who cultivated the
soil where hardly raised above the condition of beasts of the field ;
and who labored, not so much for themselves, as for their imperi-
ous masters, and were liable at any moment to be called from their
rural operations into the field of battle by the Royal mandate, or
the requisition of their own arbitrary lords.
Such multitudes of this order of men actually fell in battle, or
were destroyed by tbe accidents and fatigues of war, that hands
were wanting to carry on the necessary labors. This scarcity
caused loud complaints, and drew forth several statutes* to reduce
and fix tbe rate of wages, to compel men to become laborers, and
to restrain them from following other occupations.
These rigid enactments, which trenched so violently on natural
liberty, were enforced by severe penalties,?a proof that the evil
they were intended to remedy was seriously felt. The want of
laborers also induced many of the great landholders to enclose
their arable lands, and convert them into pasture, which rendered
them extremely unpopular; and the value of English wool de-
clared itself about this time. Manufactures being more advanced
on the Continent of Europe than in Britain, the English made a
profitable exchange of a commodity they were unable to turn to
account, for corn, and other desirable articles. James I. of Scot-
land, who had been detained a prisoner in England for 18 years
and was for the age in which he lived an accomplished and
enlightened prince, seems to have taken some pains on his release
to improve the condition of his subjects. The state of Agriculture
in his kingdom may be inferred from one of the Acts of the Scot-
tish Legislature of this time. It is ordained ? That ilk man shall
sow at the least ane firlot of quheit (wheat), half a firlot of peies,

and 40 beans, under a painc of Xs., to the Barronne of the land he
dwells in.?
From the time of the accession of the Tudor family to the
English throne, a long period of comparative tranquillity com-
menced ; during this season, the nation, not exhausted by
foreign wars, nor much disquieted by intestine factions, had leisure
afforded to apply itself to the cultivation of the Arts and Sciences,
which had been for so long a time neglected. The first great evil
which presented itself to that sagacious monarch, Henry VII., was
the decay of Agriculture, which called forth an act of his 4th
Parliament to regulate and encourage it ; and I may be permitted
to read the preamble to give an idea of the importance attached to
the subject.*
? The King, out Soverign Lord, considereth how daily within
this Realm his coin is traitorously counterfeited, murders, rob-
beries, felonies, been grieviously committed and done and also un-
lawful reteinors, idleness, unlawful plays, extorsions, misdemean-
ings of sheriffs, escheators, and many other enormities and unlaw-
ful demeanings daily grown more and more within this Realm; to
the great displeasure of God, hurt and impoverishing of his subjects,
and to the subversion of the policy and good government of this his
Realm; for, by these said enormities and mischiefs, his peace is
broken, his subjects troubled, inquieted and impoverished ; the
husbandry of this land decayed, whereby the Church of England
is upholden, the service of God continued, every man thereby
hath his sustenance, every inheritor his rent for his land.?
An act of his successor expatiates in the preamble in a most
doleful strain; on the complicated miseries which the increase of
sheep and extension of pasture had inflicted on the poor, and the
flocks of individuals which had sometimes exceeded 20,000 in
number, were reduced to 2000, the number in the hundred being
fixed by sec 12 at vi. score.t Sir Thomas More, in the spirit of
the preamble of this act, exclaims ? That a sheep is become in
England a more ravenous beast than a lion or a wolf, and could
devour whole villages, cities, and provinces.?
As an inducement to the practice of the Art, a learned judge,
Fitz Herbert, addressed a treatise thereon to Henry VIII, and
recommended the system of granting leases for three lives, in order
to encourage the yeomanry. Thomas Tusser and Barnaby Googe,
also wrote on the subject. The Georgies of the former, says
Andrews, may be read without disgust by those who have studied
Hesiod or Virgil.

Horticulture, which had been much neglected previously, now
claimed a greater degree of attention, and gardens were enriched
by importations from the Continent; hut their progress was slow,
if we believe Aikin, who informs us that Queen Catherine, first wile
of Henry VIII,, being on one occasion particularly anxious for a
salad, was, after a fruitless search had been made lor one all
through England, compelled to send for one to I 1 landers.
Dr. Henry is of opinion that it was not until the reign ol Queen
Elizabeth that pleasure grounds -were much attended to, the
orchard had been heretofore the retreat lor recreation ; and
columns, pyramids of marble, statues, and fountains with water-
works, were frequently to be seen, near the mansions ol the
nobility.
About this period also the breeding of horses seemed to have
first attracted the regard of the Legislature ; and divers statutes
regulate the height of the males, make the transporting ol horses
out of the realm, particularly to Scotland, an ollence subject to no
less a penalty than 40/., and take from horsestealers the benefit ol
clergy.* But it was found necessary in the reign of Queen Eliza-
beth to lower the standard of horses in the .counties ol Cambridge,
Huntington, Northampton, Lincoln, Norfolk, and Suffolk, on
account (as the statute recites) ?ol the rottenness, unfirmness,
moisture, and waterishness of the fen grounds, &c., being never
able, nor yet are, to breed, bear, or bring forth horses of such big-
ness and high stature as by statute are expressed.!?
Although the number of horses in England must have been
great, if we credit the assertion that the quota demanded by the
Queen in her progress through the kingdom, amounted to 30,000:
sheep and cattle, do not seem to have been equally plentiful; for
a most sanguinary act was passed in the 3th of Eliz. [cap. iii.,] pro-
hibiting the exportation of rams, lambs, or sheep alive ; by the
second section of which it was enacted, ? that every such offender
should suffer imprisonment for one year without bail and main-
prise ; and at the years end, shall, in some open market town,
in the fulness of the market, on the market day, have his left
hand cut off, and to be nailed up in the openest place of such
marketthe second offence being made felony, punishable with
death.

touching politic constitutions, for the maintenance of the navy,?
by Sec. XiV., of which it was ordained that ? no person should cat
meat on Wednesdays, on forfeiture of three pounds, or three months
close improsonment, unless in case of sickness or special license,
neither of which was to extend to beef at any time, or to veal
from the feast of St. Michael the Archangel to the first day of
Mayand great pains were taken to prove that it was a political
and not a religious measure.
The discovery of the New World, and of the passage to the
East Indies, by the Cape of Good Hope, at the close of the fifteenth
century, afforded opportunities of extended travel and observation ;
which, together with the additional lights presented by the ad-
vancement of scientific knowledge, opened new and bright pro-
spects to the people of England.
The vast addition which the general stock of aliment gained by
the introduction of the potatoe in this age, is too well known to
require comment. Captain Hawkins is said to have brought this
excellent root from Santa Fe, in New Spain ; and Sir Walter
Raleigh soon after planted it on his estate in Ireland, near Youghal.
It grew luxuriantly, but, on eating the apple which it pro-
duced, which is nauseous and unwholesome, he had well nigh con-
signed the whole crop to destruction. Fortunately the spade
discovered the true esculent, and the root became in a short time
a favorite eatable, though we may suppose it was at first confined
to the tables of the great ; for Gerrade speaks of it as ? a food>
and also a mete for pleasure, being either roasted in the embers or
boiled or eaten with oile, vinagar, and pepper, or dressed some
other way by the hands of a skilful cooke.?
The gradual introduction of the mechanical arts and manufac-
tures, opened an internal source of opulence; and as wealth now
began to circulate through the kingdom, instead of being hereto-
fore drained out of it, the condition of the people was materially
improved.
In the succeeding reign of James 1., the Art of Agriculture
made considerable progress; and that monarch passionately ad-
dicted to hunting and rural pursuits, extended to it his Royal
countenance.
The annals of this century present to us a memorable and strik-
ing example of the fallacy of the doctrine, which supposes wealth
to consist of hoards of coin or bullion, and which demonstrates-
that the true sources of the wealth of nations are ? Agriculture,
manufactures, and commerce.?
The quantity of gold and silver found in the New World,
enticed the inhabitants of old Spain, neglecting their useful pur-


suits at home, to Hock thither in such vast numbers, with the
hope of accumulating adventitious wealth, that the old country
gradually lost many of its most valuable inhabitants, which added
to the impolitic expulsion of nearly 1,000,000 citizens, (the
Moors) led to a fatal discouragement of the useful arts.
Although (as is computed) the precious metals, to the amount
in value of 150,000,000/. was poured into Spain from America; and
notwithstanding the tardy offer of the Duke of Lerma, Prime
Minister of Philip 111., of a title of nobilty to those of the gentry
who would devote their skill to the promotion and improvement of
Agriculture, and a promise of exemption from military service to
all husbandmen; her retrograde career commenced. From inability
to recruit her armies, she fell from the position she had held in the
scale of European nations, and was compelled to contract her
operations; her flourishing manufactures fell into decay ; her
fleets, which had been the terror of Europe, were ruined ; her
extensive foreign commerce was lost; her trade between different
parts of her own dominions was interrupted ; and even Agricul-
ture, the primary object of industry in every prosperous state, and
which in other nations was just emerging from the degraded condi-
tion in which it had long been buried, was neglected ; and Spain
one of the most fertile countries of Europe, hardly raised what
was sufficient for the support of her own diminished population.
The troubles of the civil wars of England, during the reign of
Charles 1., gave a brief check to its progress ; but it was during
the period of the Commonwealth, when the minds of men set them-
selves attentively to consider the requisites of true liberty, that
the plan was devised for striking from his hand the manacles which
had hitherto shackled the husbandman. This was carried into
?effect, in the reign of Charles 11., when, by the abolition of mili-
tary tenures, (those slavish I lodges of foreign dominion), and of the
-odious prerogatives of purveyance and pre-emption, the services of
the tenant were no longer measured by the arbitrary caprice of an
imperious lord ; but clearly defined, permanently assured, and
unalterably fixed on the broad basis of reason, humanity, and
justice.
Little now remains to be added to the History of Agriculture :
Suffice it then to say that, in consequence of the subject having,
within the last century and a half, deservedly attracted the imme-
diate attention of the most illustrious in the nation, from Lord
Bolingbroke to the Leicesters, Spencers, and Westerns of our day 5
and, from a careful observation of the practical result of many
proposed theories, and the adoption of the most successful, together
with the wonderful assistance afforded by the application of chemi-


cal anti scientific knowledge and mechanical power, in its different
departments, Great Britain, has, in the Art of Agriculture,
arrived at a degree of perfection unknown to the most refined
people of former ages, unequalled by the most industrious of the
present.
Having left that favored country, ?many perhaps not without
its costing a severe pang,?a country which may without feelings
of national prejudice be justly pronounced first in the scale of
nations in improvement, comfort, wealth, power, and magnificence;
we have adopted, as a future habitation, a land almost in the same
condition as when it came from the hands of its Creator. It is in
our power as it is our duty?and this appears to be the intention
of our enterprising fellow-countrymen?to render this a noble
territory ; and to accomplish that object, although laboring under
temporary inconveniences, we possess many and great advantages.
For us there are no systems to be deduced from tedious, and per-
haps disastrous experiments; no prejudices to overcome, more
stubborn enemies than the obstacles which nature herself presents ;
no difficulties in fact to contend with which the advanced state of
scientific knowledge will not enable us to triumph over and
subdue.
With the experience of neighbouring colonists to direct us in ques-
tions connected with the climate and the soil; with machinery of
the latest and most approved construction, with minds unfettered,
stimulated by the impulse of successful rivalry to constant and
unremitting industry; open to the conviction demonstrated by
practical utility ; tbe prospects of Australia Felix must be to her
adopted children encouraging in the highest degree.
To them, to you, the unfolding of her internal resources will of
course be the main object of solicitude ; and in no particular does
it appear to me that a more interesting or more remunerative line
of operation is presented, than in the healthful, peaceful, and
agreeable occupation of Agriculture.
I have I much fear trespassed too long on your patience ; but
my theme is one which could easily have induced me to dilate
much more on many interesting particulars. However, having-
exceeded the bounds of an ordinary lecture, I have to'request your
indulgence for the injustice I have been compelled to do to the
subject, and to return you my thanks for your gracious audience.
