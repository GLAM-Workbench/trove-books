PREFACE
The people who have allowed their names to appear in
the lists in this book have not done so with a view to self-
advertisement. It is hoped that the publication will serve
in a small way as a record of interest to the present and
future generations, but its main object is to swell the funds
of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Comforts Fund,
which works solely for our fighting men.
My sincere thanks are due to Messrs. Gordon and Gotch,
and to Mrs. M. A. Francis, who acted as Hon. Secretary,
whose help, in each case, was essential to the success of the
publication.

Voluntary Workers and the War.
By Ernest Scott
Professor of History in the Melbourne University.
The publication of a record of the efforts put forth by voluntary
workers during- the great war, suggests a chain of reflections on
things which distinguish this from every other war ever waged.
There has been no event in history that has absorbed the energies
of so many tens of thousands of women, testing in an inordinate
degree their capacity for taking responsibility and for adaptibility
to unaccustomed tasks, as well as their physical powers. Great
Britain could not have grappled so gallantly with the ordeal cast
upon her by the needs of her Allies, as well as by the necessities
of her own strenuous exertions, if she had not been served by the
hosts of women who have toiled in factories, offices and workshops
to further the great cause. In all quarters of .this. Empire, too,
countless voluntary workers have contributed their aid.
Now, here is something new, of which honourable account will
have to be taken when the tale is fully told.
Something new—yes, but not of course in the sense that women
have not taken part in war before. They have. There are shin-
ing instances. In the middle ages warrior women were many.
When, after the death of King Tohn, the invading French Dauphin
marched throbgh England, and seemed on the point of subduing
it, a woman, Dame Nicolaa, held Lincoln Castle firmly against
him, and by her persistency broke his power. A countess of Brit-
tany, Margaret, in the time of Edv'ard 111., was described by a
chronicler as having “the courage of a man and the heart of a
lion,” and was a very valuable ally of England in the early part
of the Hundred Years’ War. Another Margaret, the Queen of
Henry VI., can hardly be matched for unfaltering courage and
strength of will in fighting a losing cause. But the perfect
example of starry . splendour in that century is beyond all com-
parison Teanne d’Arc. the shepherdess of Lorraine, whose amazing
genius for war defies rational explanation, and whose sublimity
of self-surrender is an immortal theme for praise. A battalion of
other examples might be marshalled —the Spanish Maid of Sara-
toga, the Scottish Kate Barlass, and some heroines of the French
Revolutionary wars, such as the sisters Theophile and Felicite
Fernig, who so distinguished themselves in the campaign against
the Austrians in 1792 that General Dumouriez gave them posts on
his staff.
Comparisons with such warring women are not, however, what
is meant when we speak of the striking voluntary service rendered
during the present war. It is not in the field that the invaluable
things have been done by them. It is in the help given to those


who are fighting- and those who have fought. It is in the recog-
nition of the obligation of service in a national extremity.
To understand how new is this participation of voluntary
workers, women especially, in war work, one has to compare the
present with the greatest war preceding it. There was nothing
remotely resembling such service during the Napoleonic wars.
If one reads in the letters and memoirs of that period, one finds
no sign that women regarded the struggle as their concern as well
as that of the men who were fighting and the statesmen who
pulled the strings. Take the letters of Lady Bessborough, which
were published not many months ago, as part of the corres-
pondence of Lord Granville Leveson-Gower. Lady Bessborough
was during the period of the Napoleonic wars eminently a political
woman, the daughter of a great political family, and the associate
of the great men of politics all her life. She was intimate with
Fox, Pitt, Sheridan, Canning; she knew all that was going on
behind the scenes, and followed every movement on the public
stage with knowledge guided by high intelligence. She was a
thoroughly patriotic Englishwoman. Yet her voluminous corres-
pondence never discloses her engaged in any work connected with
the prosecution of the war. Indeed, there was none for her or any
other woman to do. It was man’s business to fight and do all that
pertained to fighting.
Miss Nightingale of course broke down that aloofness during
the Crimean War, when she organised her band of ladies to do
efficiently what men had badly muddled at the hospitals of Scutari
and Kulali. But that was a magnificent innovation to cope with
a grave emergency. It indicated no general participation. Nor
is there any conspicuous instance of such effort till the present war
made unprecedented demands upon the national energies, and tens
of thousands of willing workers rose to the occasion. Then it was
that the manifestation of a feeling of responsibility for the public
well-being on the part of women workers was so emphatically pro-
nounced as to be a new phenomenon in national life.
There is also this curious point which the ironist will note with
some satisfaction. When the eminent early-and-late Victorian
philosopher, Herbert Spencer, discussed the question of women’s
suffrage—which he did in the magisterial style of unquestionable
finality that seemed to emanate appropriately from the bald dome
beneath which his massive brain functioned—he arrived at the con-
clusion that a right to take part in the politics of a country implied
an obligation to share in its defence ; therefore, argued the philo-
sopher, “unless women furnish contingents to the army and navy
such as men furnish, it is manifest that, ethically considered, the
question of equal political rights, so called, of women, cannot be
entertained until there is reached a state of permanent peace.” But
the singularly interesting fact that the most formidable foe of the
enfranchisement of women in Great Britain, Mr. Asquith, has re-
nounced his opposition expressly because of what he has observed
of women’s voluntary work during the war, is a striking commen-
tary on the passage just quoted. In modern war the men who fight
would speedily be reduced to helplessness without the labour of
another and even larger army beyond the firing line, and it is due


to the quickened sense of national duty that that kind of labour
has been so abundantly supplied during- these years crowded with
crisis. A great king over six centuries ago laid down the prin-
ciple “quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbetur”—what touches
all should be approved by all. We now understood as never so
acutely before that what touches all is the personal concern of all,
and the feather-headed, selfish or stupid who fail to realise what
that means in time of war are simply aiding their country’s foes
and increasing its perils.
The legion of our voluntary war workers have unscathed con-
sciences in that regard. The totality of their service mounts high,
and its record is honourable. It represents not only good-will
towards a cause as righteous as any in the annals of nations, but
also an appreciation of the obligations of citizenship. For, observe,
our philosopher, though we may smile at his oracular ways, was
essentially right. Nations, in this world as it stands, will only
endure if they are able to defend their existence. The man who
fights is the ultimate factor. But in the infinite complexity of
modern war, the women who work for the men who are fighting
are not less essential than they. It may be that all the work is
not entirely well directed. Criticism may have its word as to that.
But the same observation applies to the fighting also. The thing
is—the main thing—that under such startlingly and unexpectedly
novel conditions, the sudden call for such a vast quantity of organ-
ised work should have met with such an enthusiastic and well-
directed response from the voluntary army of workers behind the
lines.
Major-General Sir William T. Bridges, C.M.G., K.C.B.
General Sir W. T. Bridges’ family came to England originally
from Holland, and were landed gentry in the time of Elizabeth,
who, in the second year of her reign, granted to the General’s
ancestor, Matthew Bridges, the family coat-of-arms.
Major-General Bridges was bom in Scotland in 1861. His
father was a captain in the Royal Navy, and it was intended that
his son should join the Imperial Army. After graduating at the
Royal Military College, Kingston, Canada, in 1881, it became neces-
sary, owing to bank failures, for the young soldier to accept the
offer of a position in the Roads and Bridges Branch of the N.S.W.
Public Works Department. In this department he remained until
he took a commission in the N.S.W. Artillery in 1885, after which
he passed all his military examinations with distinction.
In 1890 he was sent to England, the first officer so sent from
N.S.W., and he passed the “Long Course of Gunnery” and the
“Firemaster’s Course” at Woolwich, obtaining a first-class certifi-
cate with honours in each course. He was then promoted to the
rank of Captain. He served in the South African War, and during
that time held temporary staff r<ppointments with distinction.
When Federation united all the former local forces under one
Australian flag, Colonel Bridges (as a Commonwealth Staff
Officer) and Sir Edward Hutton carried out the tremendous work


of organisation and re-allotment. He passed from one important
appointment to another, became Commandant of the Royal Military
College, Duntroon, and finally succeeded General Kirkpatrick as
Inspector-General of the Commonwealth Military Forces.
When Lord Kitchener recommended the establishment of a Royal
Military College for Australia, he advised the appointment of
Colonel Bridges to organise and command it. For this he was
recalled from the War Office, where he had an appointment as
Australian representative. The College was opened in April, 1913,
and it was his great achievement in Australia. He constructed it
after the model of the .best military colleges of Europe and
America. He was wrapped up in the success of this institution,
and lived to see it bear fruit in the gallantry and efficiency of the
younger men whom he had trained. In May, 1914, he left Dun-
troon to take up his new appointment of Inspector-General, and
he had just reached Queensland on his first tour in this capacity
when war broke out and he was recalled to organise and command
the First Division.
It is customary in the British service to appoint the General
Commanding to a division already in the field, and of which,
therefore, he has only to take over the command. The reverse was
the case in regard to our First Division and Australian Imperial
Force. The General was appointed ; the divison was in nubibus.
It had to be raised, organised, trained, and equipped from the
mass of voluntary service in the quickest possible time. This,
then, was the first task which devolved upon Bridges and his
assistants, and it was of no little arduousness, considering the
raw material which was necessarily employed. He made his dis-
positions upon Imperial lines, allotting the units strictly accord-
ing to the routine of the British Army, excepting that a regiment,
instead of a squadron, was posted as divisional cavalry, exclusive
of the “Light Horse Brigade.”
The Headquarters and Victorians left Melbourne on the 25th
October, 1914. It is needless to recapitulate the oft-told story, but
it may be observed that, to the incessant training, exercise, and
“hardening” which the force underwent in Egypt, under this
scientific General’s direction and supervision, much of their sub-
sequent success was due. At Gallipoli earily in May he was
mortally wounded by a sniper’s bullet in Monash Gully when visit-
ing the trenches on the hills of Sari Bair. He refused to be carried
down by the road to the seafront, because of the danger which his
bearers would run if that route were taken. He was, therefore,
taken slowly through the winding valley, and it is noteworthy that
while this was happening, no shots were fired from the Turkish
lines. The bullet had severed two large arteries in the upper part
of his leg, and the doctors found it impossible to stop the bleeding.
He was placed on a hospital ship, but the bleeding continued, and
the General grew gradually weaker, and passed awav before the
shin reached Alexandria. His last words were. “Well, at any
rate, I am glad I have had command of an Australian Division for
nine months.” It is noteworthy that the day following the
announcement in the “Gazette” (London) that His Majesty had


awarded General Bridges the K.C.8., the news of the fatal termina-
tion of his wound appeared.
General Bridges had made a reputation for himself in the days
of peace as a remarkably efficient administrator and organiser.
Tacit and unbending, he was a soldier who took his profession in
the most serious spirit. In 1906 he attended some Swiss manoeu-
vres with the object of reporting to the Australian Government on
the Swiss military system, and it was on this Occasion that a dis-
tinguished Swiss officer who had been present, said that the foreign
military attache who impressed him most and who seemed to have
the fullest grip of the situation, was Bridges.
He was not only valuable to the nation in peace time however,
for, at the Landing and afterwards, he showed the qualities of a
great soldier and General. He directed the sending of reinforce-
ments to critical points, and showed the greatest coolness, deter-
mination and grit in face of one of the most trying situations
which a British Commander has ever had to face. He was equally
cool beneath rifle fire, never seeming to consider danger in face
of the greatest risks. His death came as the greatest shock to the
whole of Australia, and it was felt that his commanding qualities
made him absolutely unreplacable to the Commonwealth.

FORMATION AND PROGRESS OF THE LEAGUE.
On 7th August, 1914, three days after the proclamation of war,
Lady Hennessy, as Lady Mayoress, summoned a meeting of women
citizens ot Victoria, and put before tnem ner proposal to torm
a .Patriotic League of Workers tor the benefit ot our fighting
men, thus creating an entirely new link between the people and
the army that was to fignt further from its home-base tuan
ever been previously known. The movement was at once recog-
nised as essential tor the direction of the efforts of friends and
relatives who ardently desired to provide extra comforts for their
men going on active service overseas. The League was formed on
the basis of membership for every worker, and a large number of
representative women joined the General Committee, which sub-
sequently elected an Executive to carry on the work, with Lady
Hennessy as President. As soon as possible, it was ascertained
what the regulation issue and supplies would be for each man, and
all efforts were bent to supplementing these by creating reserves
of similar sunnlies for emergencies, and of additional comforts,
such as foods, tobacco, toilet and stationery goods. Officers in
command of departing units of our Expeditionary Forces never
applied in vain for extras for their men, and until the end of 1914
the mass of material coming in and going out made continuous
congestion and work at high pressure in the rooms available in the
Town Hall. The despatch to troops of gifts in large quantities
was seen by the authorities to require guidance, and by 1915 the
League was chosen to be the recognised agent in this State for
reception and despatch of all gifts other than those sent by private
donors to individual men. Our quarters expanded, a central sew-
ing-room was established, branches sprang up (they now number
over 200), and monthly meetings of their delegates and the Execu-
tive were inaugurated. With the creation in Egvpt, in September,
1915, of the “Australian Comforts Funds,” and the arrival there
of Mr. Henry Budden, as Commissioner, representing our League,
along with comforts funds in other States, the League entered on
a new phase as one of those voluntary civilian societies whose work


is welcomed by the military leaders in every war area, and acknow-
ledged as essential to the welfare of the sffidier. Mr. Budden was
our -ioneer; he created the organisation in Egypt, and England,
and France, which continues to work so well under his successu.,
Mr. T. S. Woodburn (of Dunkeld, Victoria), and the other Com-
missioners, and our debt of gratitude to him and to these other
devoted volunteers is very deep indeed. They were called on for
personal labour and bodily exertion, as well as supervision in the
establishment and running of depots, and stores, and shipping
sheds; in distribution by rail and boat, waggons and camels to
desert outposts; in strenuous loading and transhipment; but they
had their wished-for reward in the heartfelt pleasure of the weary
troops from Anzac at the timely distribution of Christmas boxes
and billies in Lemnos and Egypt.
With the removal of the main Australian forces to France, the
main stores of the Comforts Funds moved on. Business head-
quarters were acquired at 66 Victoria Street, Westminster, and
huge stores at Havre as first base. Official permission was given
for our representatives to accompany each of the Australian Divi-
sions, and special privileges accorded them in their civilian
capacity. Our goods go to the United Kingdom, are there tallied
by the bills of lading, and transhipped across channel, special
Commissioners taking charge of this part of the work. Each con-
signment has been heralded by a cable, and minutely detailed lists
go by separate mails. Equally detailed receipt lists are returned
to each State, giving number, letter, and brand on every single
case and bale, and also notes as to condition on arrival, and
instructions for future packing. At the London head office are
kept and filed all the receipts given to our distributing staff in
France by the men deputed by the O.C. of the units receiving
gifts. Every case is noted and quoted, and records kept. The
Commissioners keep in constant touch with the various divisional
units, learn what is needed, and requisition on London, where our
buyer acts. It is on these advices that the cables are framed,
which are sent to give us warning of coming necessities in goods
and money, and so our branches can absolutelv depend on sound
guidance in their work. The Commissioners accomplish also, as
part of their labour of love, the delivery of cases addressed to
special units. Experience has shown, however, that so far as cloth-
ing is concerned, it is wiser and more economical to pool these
gifts, which otherwise may arrive out of season, or when a unit is
not in special need. The Victorian Brigade depots are loyally fol-
lowing this procedure, and thereby earning the gratitude of our
hard-worked Commissioners, whose ambition is to supply suitable
goods in sufficient quantity to the men most urgently in need of
them.
By a scheme approved by the Defence Department, and helped
by the Postal Department, Victorian weekly papers are posted
direct to all Victorian units abroad. The distant wireless stations
north of Australia are also supplied.
It is the privilege of the League to help the men of the Austra-
lian Navy, as well as the Army, and various naval drafts have been
fitted, but with extra warm clothing, sports and music material,
and Christmas gifts have been forwarded for each ship’s company.


Letters are received by every mail from all ranks, eloquent with
gratitude, and showing the heartening influence of these gifts
from home. Very specially appreciated are the coffee stalls,
situated as near to the firing line as permitted by the military
authorities. From these stalls free hot drinks are served continu-
ously day and night to all men passing. It has been most grati-
fying to receive letters testifying to the great benefit derived from
this work of the Australian Comforts Fund.
1918.
The Commissioners have recently been granted military rank,
but continue to serve at their own expense.
By every mail , letters are being received in acknowledgment of
the Christmas boxes which were distributed in France, Egypt and
Palestine on Christmas Day. Victoria forwarded 64,000 boxes.
The proof to all workers of the Lady Mayoress’s Patriotic League
that their labours have not been in vain comes in the letters with
their touching expressions of gratitude for these and other com-
forts, which tend in some way to alleviate the hardships which are
being endured by OUR FIGHTING MEN.
Town Hall Depot.
Rooms and Hours. —The League’s rooms occupy the basement to
the right of the main entrance of the town Hall, and though far
too crowded for the variety of work and number of workers, are
yet extremely central and convenient for inward and outward car-
rier business. Hours are from 10 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. every week day
and to 12 noon on Saturdays. The Hon. Superintendent, Miss
Henty, and the Hon. Secretaries are always on duty, and Evecutive
members take it in turn to attend in the outer office. This serves
as a general information bureau not only for the League, but for
all the city patriotic centres, and we are very glad to be of use in
this way. Sales of wool, knitting needles, and flowers and home
produce are carried on, and during an appeal for Christmas gifts
a well-stocked “little shop” is installed to facilitate the choice of
goods suitable for packing in the special gift boxes. Another
room is used for reception and opening of “inward packages” to
be identified, tallied and entered for acknowledgment, and contents
sorted out to their respective packing tables. Here, too, socks are
examined and parcelled tightly in tens, and baled by sailors, whose
services are giver from the Naval Depot. Another room is used
for storage and packing of groceries and hardware, and our men
helpers work as best they may in the entry at the renovation,
branding and binding of cases, each one to be certified under 60 lb.
weight, lettered and numbered in sequence for the shipping lists.
Very few cases have to be bought except those specially designed
to fit Christmas gift boxes. Petrol cases and ammunition cases
are gifted in scores, and our own workers prepare them on the
spot. Upstairs in the “supper-room” sewing goes on by machine
and hand under Mrs. Annear’s supervision; mistakes are rectified,
sample garments made for patterns, and any stocks deficient are


made up to requirements. Here thousands of leather vests received
their finishings. A party of ladies under Mrs. Bates take it in
turns to serve the workers with afternoon tea at a charge that
covers the expenses.
Mrs. Lyle’s Flower Stall is now well known. Her daily work of
cutting and gathering the flowers and foliage from her own and
the various gardens placed at her disposal by friends goes on in
all weathers, and her car delivers many standing orders. Her
work involves a very heavy correspondence as well, so that country
supplies are despatched in the best times and conditions. No
hours seem too long or work too hard to please the people who like
to help the League by giving in this direction, and the result this
year has been £550 added to our funds.
At the time of the busy recruiting days those in charge of our
rooms saw an opportunity of helping the cause by providing warm
light refreshments for the hard-worked staff. A special “soldiers’
box” fund was started to finance this, by friends of the move-
ment, and has been kept up ever since, making it possible to be
of service to many returned men working for recruiting. The
League has made many valued friends in this way, and our own
staff has gained an insight into some of the problems of repatria-
tion.
Metals—Thrift Branch.
Hon. Managers: Dr. Levin and Mr. H. M. Sargood.
This comparatively new branch is an enterprise started, and
now well organised, by Dr. Levin and Mr. H. M. Sargood, and has
developed from being a saving and selling of old metals only,
into thrift of many previously wasted household and trade goods.
A three-floor building, with ample storage room and convenient
cartage entry, has been secured at 182 Collins Street. It is open
from 10 to 1, and 2 to 5 daily, and will shortly be connected on the
telephone.
In every locality this means of helping the League may be
started by patriotic citizens, and our branches are particularly
urged to establish depots close to their local railway stations, as
packages are carried free on the railways when labelled with the
League’s own label. Everything collected is sorted out according
to destination, and buyers are found. The proceeds all go to the
funds of the League, and householders and tradesmen should be
glad to benefit the League, and, at the same time, do service by
preventing loss of valuable material. Information and guidance
in methods of collection can be obtained from the organisers, Dr.
Levin, Melbourne Mansions, Collins St., or H. M. Sargood, Esq.,
c/o L.M.P.L., Town Hall.

BALLARAT.
Since its inauguration in June, 1916, the Ballarat Branch of the
Lady Mayoress’s Patriotic League has consistently and steadily
expanded, until it now embraces about 40 sub-branches within a
radius of 50 miles pf Ballarat.
The following list of articles made by our members will be
sufficient proof of their untiring efforts on behalf of our gallant
men on active service :—lB,lOO pairs of socks, 8,380 shirts, various

BENDIGO MUNICIPAL.
The Bendigo Municipal Branch was opened on the 13th Decem-
ber, 1916. In addition to the workroom at the Town Hall, which is
supervised by Mrs. Beebe and Miss Wills as heads of the sewing
and knitting departments respectively, there are two subsidiary
depots. The newspaper depot was organised by Mrs. G. H. Free-
man, the papers for which are collected by the Boy Scouts, and the
thrift depot in the Market Building is under the management of
Mrs. Cupit-Bowman. The income of the branch for the year
amounted to £684/5/7. Besides £235 being cabled abroad for
Tommy Cookers and the coffee stalls at the back of the trenches,
large quantities of socks, shirts, underpants, etc., and general
comforts, as well as 1,440 Xmas boxes and 500 magazines, were
packed and dispatched. The ex-Mayoress, Mrs. William Beebe,
was President for nine months, and Mrs. R. H. S. Abbott, the
present Mayoress, now occupies the chair. The Treasurer is Mr.
William Beebe, ex-Mayor. . The work is greatly helped by the
Mayor and Councillors granting the free use of rooms, ligntmg,
etc., by the services of the Town Hall staff, and by the press for
their wholehearted support.

BROADMEADOWS MENDING AND SOLDIERS’ AID SOCIETY.
The object for which this Society was formed in February,
1915, was to care for the clothing- of recruits, but as opportunities
of enlarging our usefulness have presented themselves, we have
been able to extend our efforts. The Defence Department assists
us in every way, and have written appreciatively of our work. We
mend for all metronolitan camps, and do this or alterations
brought free of charge. We also visit and mend at clearing hos-
pitals. The work of placing convalescent soldiers in homes during
their sick leave was introduced by this Society, but has since
passed into official channels. Through the efforts of our sewing
guild we are able to supply a parcel of underclothing, socks, etc.,
for eveiy transport leaving Melbourne. These goods are given to
the Y.M.C.A. officer and distributed by him to soldiers on the boat
whose kits have been lost or stolen. In this way 5,686 articles
have been distributed, and we have also provided this year 478 new
garments, besides good second-hand clothing to returned men sent
us by the State War Council. Christmas in camp, instituted by
this Society in 1915, is an entertainment for those' soldiers left on
duty in the metropolitan camps on Christmas Day. The public
response is so generous to our appeal for funds for this purpose
that we are enabled to supply poultry, ham, beef, Christmas pud-
dings, cakes, pies, ices, etc., and also to distribute a present of
pipes, tobacco and cigarettes to each man, and to give them a
really enjoyable Christmas, usually their last before embarkation.

CASTERTON.
The Casterton Branch of the L.M.P.L. was formed on September
12th, 1916. Monthly committee meetings have been held regularly.
Every alternate week we have the use of the Red Cross Room. We
sew there on Tuesdays, and hold a sale of gifts on Thursdays. The
latter has proved a great success. We also give out work to be
made up and sent to the Central Depot, in the shape of socks,
scarves, mittens, etc. We have just spent ,£2OO on foodstuffs suit-
able for the men in the trenches, and have also made donations to
various patriotic funds.

CHARLTON.
In the winter of 1916 several of the young: ladies of Charlton
formed a Soup Kitchen for the boys in the trenches, which proved
such a success that they decided to continue the work under the
name of Charlton Patriotic Supper Rooms, having: coffee and
cakes every Saturday night and entertainments occasionally. The
suppers realised £l6O in six months. We purchased a quantity of
wool and flannel, which our members and friends made up into
socks and shirts, and we sent these to the Lady Mayoress’s League,
with £4O in cash for Xmas boxes, and .£95 for foodstuffs for the
men in the trenches; also a case of goods containing- over 240
tinned articles.

FIRST AUSTRALIAN PIONEER DEPOT.
In August, 1916, a meeting was held at “Home Estate,” Kama-
rooka, to form a First Australian Pioneer Depot to work for the
men in the trenches. The Misses Hay, who originated the idea,
and through whose efforts the Ist, 2nd and 4th Battalion, Melbourne
workers were formed into a club, gave .the use of their home, and a
club was formed, with Mrs. T. E. Ayres Secretary. Parcels were
posted straight to the men, and cases sent through the Lady
Mayoress’s Patriotic League. All men from the district receive
parcels and smokes at intervals. Last Xmas the club sent 50
Christmas hampers. Meetings are held at “Home Estate” every
fortnight. Members contribute weekly. Mr. M. Miles carries all
our parcels free of charge. The sum of ,£4/10/- was granted by the
Kamarooka Wheat Fund to make bedsocks, and 230 pairs were
despatched. Fifty-seven Xmas boxes were sent through our Kama-
rooka depot for Xmas, 1917. Articles sent away during the year
number 1,654. 434 articles of tinned food, fruit and sweets,
worth of tobacco were sent last year. This year another ,£lO is to
be forwarded.

GLEN IRIS SEWING CIRCLE.
This consists of 32 members. It was established in August,
1914, to work for various patriotic objects. The work has been
continued steadily during the currency of the war, meetings being
held every Tuesday. The circle obtains its funds by the sale of
kid-lined waistcoats made by one of its members, by their regular
monthly subscriptions and by an occasional fete. The objects for
which it works are the Red Cross Society, the French Red Cross
Society, the Lady Mayoress’s Patriotic League, and the Societe
Maternelle. It has given donations to the Belgian Relief Fund, to
the Prisoners of War Fund, and to the Camberwell Convalescent
Home for Soldiers. It also stands as godmother to two French war
babies, to whom it sends outfits of clothes and a gift of money twice
yearly.

This branch, formed in August, 1914, has not only despatched a
weekly consignment of goods to the Australian Comforts Fund at
the Melbourne Town Hall and to the Federal Government House
Red Cross Society Depot, but has forwarded many cases also to the
Base Hospital; also large quantities of honey, jam, cakes, etc.,
It has assisted the French Red Cross with socks, and sent cases of
clothing for the widows and orphans in France and Belgium. In
response to special appeals, 344 pairs of socks were donated to the
French Red Cross in 1916, and 978 pairs to the Australian Com-
forts Fund in 1917. Two hundred and thirty-six district soldiers
have received equipments, and 98 Xmas boxes and 250 Xmas pud-
dings have been despatched to the front. On two occasions con-
tingents of returned wounded soldiers and motorists have been
entertained at lunch and afternoon tea, and the members of the
League have assisted all other patriotic efforts in the town. The
League also has arranged each year a service in commemoration
of Anzac Day. Work meetings are held each Wednesday and
Thursday in the Mechanics’ Institute, while the Church Auxiliaries
meet in their own school halls, and the country branches in
their own districts. The number of articles made and despatched
by the League is over 5,000, also 28 cases of old linen and 20
cases of magazines and books. In addition to these, large quan-
tities of swabs, bandages, pads, soap, cigarettes, tobacco, sweets,
splints, groceries, etc., have been sent to the Red Cross Society.
The special patriotic appeals have been well responded to. In
connection with the League of Honour, groups for the purchase of
War Certificates are being formed.

residence at Deepdene of Mrs. William Bates, where the meeting's
are held, is comprised of a number of friends who meet at “Larino”
every Wednesday for work from 10 o’clock until 5.30 p.m.. The
material for garments has been and is supplied by Mrs. William
Bates, and has since registration of the branch under the above
name been purchased under the concessions, as to price, applying
to similar branches. The workers comprise some 14 to 16 friends,
who have now been working together for two years, during the
latter eighteen months of which the product of their work has been
given entirely to the Lady Mayoress’s Patriotic League. During

We began in October, 1914, to work for the Belgians, and sent
both money and clothing to help relieve their awful suffering.
Then we called ourselves the Women’s Patriotic Comforts League,
and added to our activities knitting for the boys of the Maryborough
district, and sent Xmas parcels to every Maryborough soldier. In
1916 we became a branch of the L.M.P.L., and have every month
sent a parcel of socks, etc., to Melbourne.

METHODIST LADIES’ COLLEGE OLD COLLEGIANS’ CLUB.
Our Society was started about a year ago, consequently we have
not a great many workers, as many of the members of our club
had already filled their time with other patriotic work. We are
hoping to get the younger members, as they leave school, to join
us to work in the future. We are a registered branch of the
League, and have sent in 359 articles, also some pillow slips, band-
ages, etc., to the Caulfield Hospital, and a parcel of children’s
clothes to the French Red Cross.

NEWSPAPER DEPOT AND WASTE PAPER BRANCH.
In June, 1916, I commenced to canvass the city for the collection
of waste oaper, and on August 7th of the same year the Newspaper
Depot at 454 Collins Street was opened. From small beginnings
it has developed into a very profitable business for the L.M.P.
League, and has now 23 voluntary workers on the roll, all of whom
do their best to make it a success.
Mrs. Harry Kemp was my first helper, and did splendid work.
In September, 1916, Mrs. Charles Gavan-Duffy joined us, promis-
ing five hours daily, which she has given unceasingly. But for her
yeoman service and that of the Boy Scouts (who collect the news-
papers in the city), the final result which has been achieved by the
depot would have been impossible.
The .first year the takings were £635, and at present average a
little over £1,000 per annum, the total to date being £1,083.

NORTH AND WEST MELBOURNE.
The North and West Melbourne Branch of the League was in-
augurated in August, 1914. The Lady Mayoress ((Lady Hennessy)
attended and explained the objects of the League. Mrs. Mattingly
was elected President, and occupied that position for four months.
On the retirement of Mrs. Mattingly, Mrs. J. K. Troup was elected
President. The Vice-Presidents elected since the inaugural meet-
ing are Mesdames Leeming, Bent, and Messrs. Davidson and
Woolfe. Miss Mav Clack has carried out the duties of Honorary
Treasurer, and Miss Ellen Mulcahy has occupied the position of
Honorary Secretary since the inception of the League. The sum of
£622/0/10 has been raised locally during the period, and expended


in material for clothing for soldiers. Meetings of the League have
been held fortnightly. The City Council has granted the free use
of a room in the North Melbourne Town Hall for the work of the
League. The sewing room is open every Tuesday from 10 a.m. to
9.30 p.m. Mrs. H. Wolfe has been appointed honorary supervisor
of work, and has acted in that capacity for two years. About 7,000
articles have been forwarded to the Central Depot. In addition, the
committee has taken part in every effort put forward for obtaining
funds for war v'ork, and nearly ,£3,000 has been handed in to the
authorities.

WOMEN’S DIVISION, ORMOND.
This League was formed for the purpose of organising a small
section of people on the extreme borders of three municipalities,
too far from the centres to be able to work conveniently in their
own districts. There are about 35 members, and a few school-
girls who knit.
The League is supported by monthly contributions. Entertain-
ments have also been given in aid of this League. Sewing meet-
ings are held weekly at the Ormond Hall, which is lent free of
charge, and machines have also been lent gratis by Messrs. Tye
and Co..
The constitution of the League allows this branch to work for
any of the patriotic causes that exist, but the main work has been
in connection with the L.M.P.L., with which it is affiliated.
The League has donated two cots to the No. 11 A.G. Hospital,
and large parcels of goods have been sent by this League to that
hospital. Vegetable days, egg days and a jam day in aid of the
Caulfield Hospital have been of benefit to the instiution.
Since its inception the Women’s Division has sent out over 3,000
articles.

MEN'S DIVISION, ORMOND.
This League since its inception in November, 1915, has done
good work in w-hat would otherwise have been a neglected district.
Through the munificent offer of a resident, a workshop fully equip-
ped for joinery work was thrown open for the use of the men’s
section of the League, and good work has been done, principally for
the Red Cross Society, and by the women’s section for the Red
Cross Society, Lady Mayoress’s Patriotic League, and No. 11 Aus-
tralian General Hospital, and donations have been made to various
special appeals as necessity has arisen. In contributions, donations
and special efforts about .£4OO has been raised, and after allowing
for special donations referred to, material has been purchased for
the manufacture of 4,500 articles, valued at ,£B5O, and in addition
two beds have been supplied, equipped, and are being maintained
at the No. 11 A.G.H. in the name of the League.

S.O.S., PORTLAND.
The origin of the S.O.S., Portland branch of Lady Mayoress’s
Patriotic League was due to Lady Hennessy’s appeal for 1,000 socks.
It was seen that the Portland women would have to have a society
separate from the Red Cross to enable them to send goods straight
to the trenches. A meeting was then called, at which about 40
sympathisers attended. The following officers were elected: —
President, Mrs. F. Stock; Vice-President, Mrs. J. Couch; Secretary,
Mrs. W. Hart; Treasurer, Mrs. A. Taylor. It was decided to call
the society by the wireless signal to send on succour, as that
should also stand for “Send on Socks,” and to register and become
a branch of the Lady Mayoress’s League. A temporary room was
kindly loaned by Mrs. R. Cleghorn, where the society met every
Monday afternoon. A rubber stamp was donated with S.O.S.,
League, Portland, Victoria on it, and every article sent has a piece
of tape stamped and sewn on. For the first five months 669 pairs
of socks, 28 helmets, 19 mittens and 6 scarves have been forwarded
to Headquarters.

on the outbreak of war. Meetings were held three and four times
per week at Mrs. Carnegie’s home, “Southesk,” and at these in less
than three weeks were made over 500 articles out of wool and flannel
which Mrs. Carnegie donated. Several mosquito tents which were


wanted immediately for New Guinea were also made, as well as the
usual shirts, hospital shirts, pyjamas, cholera belts, socks, etc. This
branch was kept going; until Mrs. Carnegie went to America, after
which the members joined the Kew branch. On her return, Mrs.
Carnegie found there was no need for a separate branch, and
decided to put her energy also in the Kew branch.

A committee was formed in August, 1914, with Mrs. Russell as
President for the first month. This was then disbanded, and a re-
election took place, with Mrs. Charles Steele President, and she
has held that office up to the present date. This branch was one of
the first to form and affiliate with the Central Depot at the Town
Hall, Melbourne. There are over 100 steady workers on the books,
besides several guilds. Neerim North has worked well, having
started with seven girls and numbering over 30. Since the begin-
ning of war this branch has made over 22,000 articles, principally
shirts and socks, for the L.M.P.L. ; and to Belgian relief 5,000
and Red Cross 9,000, in all 36,000 articles.

TOORAK.
The Toorak Branch was originally formed in the winter of 1915,
among the friends and supporters of the 4th Field Artillery Brigade.
Five consignments of comforts were despatched privately to this
brigade, when word was received from the O.C. that the personnel
of the brigade was being merged into others to such an extent that
particular benefits had to be abandoned in favour of general assist-
ance through the organised channels. The former work party
became the nucleus of the Toorak Branch, and general adherence
wag made to the L.M.P.L. The first delivery was made to the League
in August, 1916, and since then substantial weekly contributions
have been made. The branch has about 30 regular members, who
meet every Monday at Mrs. George Kelly’s, “Montalto, Orrong-
road, Toorak. The branch is entirely maintained by voluntary con-
tributions from its own circle.

UPPER BEACONSFIELD, No. 13.
This branch, called the Red Cross and War Relief Society, started
work for the Belgian children six weeks after the outbreak of the
war. Upper Beaconsfield had several visits of the cadets from the
“L’Avenir,” and has always taken a keen interest in the Belgian
boys. After our first big box, which went to Belgium direct, we
have made socks, etc., and send them to the Lady Mayoress’s
Patriotic League. Besides that we have given every boy who has
gone from the district to the war a gift of suitable clothing, and
on several occasions have sent parcels to our local boys, 31 of whom
have left here. We meet once per week. Money raised at a fete
held once a year helps to purchase all material. We have a most
energetic President in Mrs. A. V. Kirkwood. All the members
mentioned below belong to the Australian Women’s National
League except Miss Glismann.

WINCHELSEA.
The Winchelsea Patriotic League was formed in August, 1914.
At this meeting Mrs. McCailum was elected President of the
League, Mrs. R. Jones as Treasurer, and Mrs. A. Eddie as Secre-
tary. These office-bearers have been re-elected at each annual
meeting, and, with the exception of Mrs. Jones, who has left the
district, and whose place has been .filled by Mrs. A. McCailum,
are still in office. Our League has held monthly meetings since
its formation. It is under th'e control of the Winchelsea Shire
Council, and to that body it renders monthly a statement of its
finances and operations. To the young people we are indebted for
the great number of socks they contribute. Miss Elsie Kelly has
knitted the greatest number of pairs of socks handed in by one
person to our League. When our League was started, three cases'
of goods were sent to the Lady Mayoress’s League, and of these
no record was kept of the contents. Since then a strict record has
been kept of all articles sent, and altogether we have forwarded to
the League and the Red Cross Central Depot about 10,447 articles.
The monies contributed amount to .£1,404/10/11.

AUSTRALIAN FLYING CORPS.
The Australian Flying Corps Comforts’ Depot was started by
Mrs. E. H. Reynolds, wife of Lieut.-Colonel E. H. Reynolds, Com-
mander of the 1st Australian Flying Squadron, on the departure of
that squadron for Egypt in March, 1916. Through the courtesy of
the Registrar of the Cathedral Buildings, a suitable room has been
placed at the disposal of the committee, rent free. Meetings are
held every Wednesday, when relatives and friends of the men in the
squadrons, some of which are in Egypt and Palestine, some in
Mesopotamia, some in France, and some in England, meet and
exchange news. Material for garments and socks is given out at
these meetings for making and despatch to the front. Funds are
obtained by donations and regular subscriptions, also from various
entertainments which have been successful in raising considerable
sums, which have been expended in sending clothing, tinned
goods, tobacco, etc., including Xmas billies and boxes, to all the
'fronts.

AUSTRALIAN TUNNELLING AND BORING COY. COMFORTS
FUND.
In response to a letter from the secretary of the Mining- Corps
Comforts Fund, Sydney, a meeting- was called on 3rd April, 1916,
at the rooms of the Australian Institute of Mining Engineers, tc
establish a branch in Melbourne. Mrs. G. C. Klug was elected
President, Mrs. de Jersey Grut and Mrs. P. R. Sutherland, Vice-
Presidents, Lady Mawson, Hon. Treasurer, and Mrs. E. W. Skeats,
and Mrs. Stanley Hunter, Joint Hon. Secretaries. Owing to the
generosity of various mining companies, there has been no anxiety
regarding funds, several companies contributing handsome dona-
tions monthly. To December, 1917, we- have received from all
sources £1,121/5J5, the revenue for the first year being ,£520/11/3,
and the second, ,£600/14/2. At Mr. Budden’s request we are pool-
ing our comforts, and have sent to the L.M.L. nearly 3,000 articles.
We have sent to the trenches from June, 1916, to March, 1918, 3,459


articles. In addition to this a large quantity of tobacco, many cases
of sweets and 129 cases of foodstuffs have been shipped, and ,£l4O
has been cabled direct to the companies. By the courtesy of Mr.
de Jersey Grut, Room 89, Modern Chambers, was placed at our
disposal, and furnished by the kindness of some members of the
committee. Generous donations from Mrs. G. W. Klug and Singers
Company were two sewing machines for use at the depot. One of
our most constant helpers since our inauguration has been McLel-
lan and Co., the Big Store, Prahran, who have cut out free of
charge many hundreds of shirts. Several guilds have also rendered
great help.
The depot is open on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 2
p.m. to 5 p.m. A branch of the Fund was opened at Bendigo the
end of 1916. We have supplied several outgoing transports with
musical instruments, woollen clothing and other comforts. In
August, 1916, Mrs. G. Weir accepted the position of Treasurer, in
place of Lady Mawson, resigned. In September, 1917, Mrs. E. W.
Skeats resigned her position as Secretary owing to ill-health.
Several returned men have visited the depot and given accounts
of the marvellous work of the Tunnelling Co. in France. An
appropriate Roll of Honour, the work of Mrs. Penleigh Boyd, has
been presented by her for the enrolment of the names of those of
our men who have won distinctions.

FIFTH PIONEER BATTALION, FIFTH DIVISION.
In July, 1916, the next-of-kin of the officers of sth Pioneers
resident in Melbourne formed themselves into a committee, with
the object of providing comforts for the men of the battalion. We
have raised funds by various means, and made up and sent off
hundreds of pounds worth of comforts to the chaplain for distri-
bution among the men of the unit. We also endeavour to visit
and keep in touch with the families of the men. We are only a
small company, as many sth Pioneers hail from other States, but
there is a fine spirit of helpful co-operation among our workers.

SECOND F.A. BRIGADE.
The depot for the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade was opened on
April 15th, 1916, with Mrs. J. Strachan as President, Miss Teare,
Treasurer, and Mrs. H. A. Dodd, Hon. Secretary, and a strong
committee. Our work was to send as much food and clothing to
the men, packed in cases and sent through the Lady Mayoress’s’
Patriotic League. For Xmas, 1916, we sent 1,000 Xmas boxes, and
the men received them all in good time. We also sent the same
number for 1917, which they received on December 26th. The com-
mittee this year also collected ,£2OO for the men to have a good
Xmas dinner, and we have had letters telling us of the delightful
time they had—turkeys, fowls, etc., and plenty of smokes.

TENTH INFANTRY BRIGADE DEPOT.
The depot was first organised in May, 1916, and has been in
active existence ever since. The rooms, kindly lent to the depot
by Messrs. John Danks and Co., are situated at 401 Bourke-street,
and are open on Tuesdays and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The Melbourne depot looks after the 37th, 38th and 39th Battalions.
The sum of £575 has been cabled direct to the brigade and its
various units during 1917, to be expended on comforts for the
troops, and 218 cases of tinned goods have been sent direct.
Early in 1917 it was decided to “pool” all the socks, and during
the year 4,500 pairs have been sent to the Lady Mayoress’s
Patriotic League; also 200 pairs of socks have been posted to bat-
talions, and 300 sent to reinforcements at Broadmeadows; 1,100
shirts, 70 towels and 2,550 handkerchiefs to the Town Hall. This
was the first depot to decide to publish a paper, and the “10th Bri-
gade News” is published monthly, the present circulation being
nearly. 1,000 copies per month. This paper is a source of great
pleasure to the members, particularly the country members, and
shows a good financial profit. Morning and afternoon tea is served
in the depot. This is greatly appreciated by the workers, and
incidentally is a source of revenue to the depot. Parcels for in-
dividual soldiers are packed and posted from the shop at the depot,
this being found a great convenience for country members. A con-
siderable portion of the income of the depot is expended on tinned
goods, flannel (for shirts, etc.), and wool. In 1917. 3.750 boxes
were sent in the first instance, but as, unfortunately, 2,200 of these
went down on the “Port Kembla,” a further effort was made, and
an additional 1,100 were sent. Besides the actual work done at the
depot, it forms a centre where the latest news of the brigade may
be obtained, letters discussed, etc., and is, in short, a social club,
which has been a great comfort and help to the women relatives
and friends of the men of the 10th Brigade.

THIRD DIVISIONAL SIGNAL COMPANY.
A Comforts Fund Committee of ladies interested in the Third
Divisional Signal Company was formed in 1916, and worked for a
time as a separate unit. In 1917 the committee was absorbed in
the General Comforts Fund for all Engineer Companies (Field and
Signalling), and the members met regularly and worked for the
benefit of the Engineers as a whole. With the sanction of the War
Council a separate committee, affiliated with the Lady Mayoress’s
Patriotic League, was established in September, 1917, and its
activities have been displayed as follows :—,£9o have been cabled
to the C.O. of the company to procure comforts for the men in the
trenches, socks have been knitted and forwarded in different par-
cels, and 300 Xmas boxes were sent away. The committee meets
every Thursday afternoon at the Victorian Railways Institute, and
members are able to exchange news and give pne another interest-
ing bits of information, while working for the benefit of the boys,
many of whom come from other States.

THIRD DIVISIONAL SUPPLY COLUMN MOTOR TRANSPORT.
This League was inaugurated in May, 1916, a month prior to
the embarkation of this regiment, known as the “Leather Heads,”
under Major Lyons. A committee was formed, with Mrs. Lyons
as President, which position she still holds. It was decided to hold
work meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Savoy Cafe, where
the management kindly lent a room for the use of the workers.
Forty cases of comforts were put on board the transport for the
unit. The object of the League was to keep as far as possible in
touch with the regiment until its return, to send comforts and extra
clothing, tobacco, cigarettes, etc. This was done through the
Lady Mayoress’s Patriotic League until June, 1917, when it was
decided to pool shirts and socks, sending them to the Australian
Comforts Fund. The number of articles sent by the 3rd D.S.C.M.T.
Comforts Depot up to December, 1918, being 384.

THE AUSTRALIAN WOMEN’S NATIONAL
LEAGUE.
“Women’s souls shall march beside you; women’s love shall hold
you fast;
While you fight the fight of honour till your triumph come at last.
Then, since war is harsh and cruel —God, be kind to women’s pain;
Pride shall keep our hearts from breaking if you come not back
again.”
A RECORD OF VOLUNTARY WAR WORK ACCOMPLISHED
BY THE A.W.N. LEAGUE.
Foreword by Mrs. Arthur Robinson.
When the League was founded just fourteen years ago, war,
dread war, was absent even from the subconsciousness of all of us.
The clash of arms belonged to history, and dimly the traditions of
our race stirred us in an indefinite way, never dreaming that we
of the twentieth century would each have a part in the most colos-
sal war in all history, and moreover, that we should share in up-
holding traditions for maintaining the freedom of the world won for
us in the establishment of that freedom. “It is well to remember
the fortitude which made us a nation at a time when fortitude is
required of us again.”
It almost seemed as if the Australian Women’s National League
had been moulded and trained for the crisis and the test of the
nation in war, for its motto, “Pro Deo et Patria,” embraced its
ideals and aspirations and has proved no empty phrase. Its objects
were broad, its organisation embracing upwards of 50,000 women,
divided into close upon 500 branches spread through the State of
Victoria and Riverina) was a sound foundation for war con-
ditions, an asset to rely upon when the Call of Empire came.
The League is constantly being met with the assertion that it is
“only political.” Nothing could be further from the truth. First
and last and all the time the Australian Women’s National League
is national in its aims, objects, aspirations, and, more convincing
than all, in' its deeds. It has been managed and controlled solely
by women from its inception, and perhaps it has been by woman’s
proverbial tenacity that the word “National” has been retained, for
in the years of peace critics tried to eliminate the word “National,”
a word which now expresses so much, and which even scorn and
ridicule failed to remove from the League’s title. Truly the League
was a party organisation before the war cast all parties into the
great melting pot. The fate of Empire literally is in the balance,
and depends on the utmost limit of support that can be given by
every individual man and woman, and there must be thought for
only one thing—to win the war. That the phrase “to win the war”
is not an empty one to the Australian Women’s National League


is evidenced by the fact that in spite of the record, given in this
volume, of purely patriotic effort and achievement, the organisa-
tion has had to face four General Elections and two Referendums
since the outbreak of war in August, 1914. This has meant an
almost Herculean strain upon our women, and particularly upon
those bolding responsible office, but the women of the League have
never faltered. Though there have been abnormal demands on
thir time and energy in the ordinary League work, their patriotic
work has never been neglected. Though scores of them carry a
load of anxiety for those men of theirs who are far from them in the
welter of the battlefield, their spirit of sacrifice has not ended in
sending their men folk to “fight the fight of honour,” as the
League’s record of work proves.
The A.W.N.L. Milk Fund alone, started in November, 1915 (as
soon as the necessity of milk for the men in the trenches became
known), has become such an established war fund, and has been so
splendidly supported, that we doubt if there is another fund of its
kind in the Empire that amounts to over .£3,000 a year, the total
amount received to date being .£B,OOO. This means a regular
supply leaving by every outgoing transport for the men in the
trenches through the Lady Mayoress’s Patriotic League.
Space will not permit of enlargement upon the League’s many
activities, amounting, as they do, from the outbreak of the war, to
upwards of ,£20,000, which includes a large ward costing £(1,100 in
the Caulfield Military Hospital, a lasting memorial to one Austra-
lian brave, four motor ambulances costing £(2,138, and manv other
gifts of inestimable value to the fighting man and to the wounded,
not only of our own British, but of most of the allied nations. Nor
have the Australian prisoners of war been forgotten, for the
A.W.N.L. is at present sending 3,700 tins of fruit per month in the
Red Cross parcels, which prove such a boon to Australian prisoners
of war in Germany.
No record of the League’s war work would be complete with-
out drawing special attention to the wonderful achievements of the
branches in the Deniliquin district of New South Wales. Their
Not until this awful war ends will the patriotic work, of this
League cease. And whilst the war still rages, the League is seek-
ing to look ahead to that aftermath of the war when the final test
of the nation’s trial must come, hoping that the women in her
ranks may, through much tribulation, be ready to do their part in
the great rebuilding of the fortunes of their loved Australia.
The following list shows approximately the amount of money
raised and distributed by the League in her war activities. It is
impossible to specify in detail the number of garments, socks, etc.,
made by the A.W.N.L. War Work Partv, and soldiers’ comforts of
all kinds contributed by the branches and sent through the L.M.P.L.
and Red Cross Society.

FRIENDLY UNION OF SOLDIERS’ WIVES.
The “Friendly Union of Soldiers’ Wives” was formed in 1914
by Her Excellency Lady Helen Munro Ferguson, who, feeling the
necessity of binding the relatives of those fighting for us at the
front more closely together, for mutual help and comfort, called a
meeting of officers’ wives at Federal Government House.
It was agreed at this preliminary meeting that a Union should
be formed with the above title. At first the membership was
limited to wives only, but as the Union grew it was found that in
order to develop the scope of the usefulness of the movement,
mothers and widows also of our fighting men should be included.
A Council meeting is held once a month, also a social gathering
with musical items and tea, which enables the members to meet
together in a friendly manner, besides obtaining useful and inter-
esting information from short addresses which are given by re-
turned soldiers and others.
The most useful part of the work, though, is carried on at the
F.U.S.W. Room at Commerce House (kindly lent to us free by the
Commercial Travellers’ Association), which is open daily from 2


till 4, where there is always someone in attendance to interview
callers and discuss requests for help or information regarding their
relatives.
For the last two Christmases the mothers and children of our
members have been entertained and given a Christmas treat, which
all have thoroughly enjoyed, there being over 3,000 present at that
held in 1917, when each child received a toy and a bag of cakes.
There is an Executive Committee which carries out the detail
work which is relegated to it by the Council, and also a visiting
committee, members of which personally visit and enquire into the
circumstances of any woman who has appealed for help. Invalu-
able work is carired out by these members, and they have been
able to bring help and comfort to many of our fellow-women who
have been in trouble and want while their menfolk are at the war,
and thus have helped to ease their burden of loneliness and
anxiety.

YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
NATIONAL STATEMENT.
The Young- Men’s Christian Association in recent years has
been a vital organisation touching the life of the nation. Lord
Derby’s tribute to the work of the organisation in the trite sen-
tence, “The Y.M.C.A. in peace is invaluable, in war indispen-
sable,” gives the right perspective, for it was not until the war
clouds lowered and the nations were hastening their preparations
with feverish anxiety that the Y.M.C.A. unostentatiously but ex-
peditiously perfected its plan of campaign for extending its opera-
tions in a great community and national work on behalf of the
troops in training camps, at advanced bases, and at the front.
When the declaration of war came, the Association was ready
for service, and in ten days had established itself at 250 centres.
The work grew apace, until there is now throughout the Empire
a staff of over 1,000 secretaries working with the troops. The
magnitude of the work is indicated in the fact that half a million
sterling was spent by the Y.M.C.A., all raised by public subscrip-
tion, in the first year of the war, and £1,200 is now spent per
week in providing writing materials for the troops. The Y.M.C.A.
is in every theatre of war, serving British, Canadian, New Zea-
land, Australian, Indian, South African, and West Indian troops.
It has centres for sailors and dockers’ battalions and munition
workers, as also hostels in France and England. In enemy coun-
tries it has 70 secretaries at work among the allied prisoners of
war. This privilege of serving our prisoners of war was obtained
only after weeks of international negotiations, and was finally
arranged by securing secretaries from a neutral country to carry
on this work. Its work in military camps is for every soldier, and
its facilities and privileges are available to all.
In Australia the Y.M.C.A. has rendered service in practically
every military camp. More than £60,000 has been spent in service
and equipment in the various State camps. Each transport of any
size leaving Australia carries a Y.M.C.A. secretary. Secretaries
numbering 150 have been sent abroad with the A.I.F. The high-
est military authorities abroad endorse the work of the Y.M.C.A.
with our troops, and urge its extension.
By direction of the Defence Department, the Y.M.C.A. of Aus-
tralia is made responsible for the moral, social and recreational
welfare of the troops in camps of training in Australia, on trans-
ports both forward and returning, camps of training overseas, and
at the front.
The Y.M.C.A. in relation to its ordinary or peace activities does
not benefit by one penny through the contributions of the public.
In its war work the Association is performing a specific and
definite service for the direct benefit of Australian soldiers and
sailors on active service.
This fund covers expenditure on buildings, marquees, dug-
outs, pianos, furniture, cinematography, stationery, libraries,
sporting material, etc. The Y.M.C.A. is wholly responsible for the


salary, etc., of its representatives attached to the A.I.F. These
representatives having- an honorary relationship to the military
forces as Y.M.C.A. officers.
The huts and marquees serving Australian troops on the dif-
ferent fighting fronts are almost wholly built by Australian money
and manned by Australian Y.M.C.A. representatives. By direction
of the Military High Command, marquees are used in the forward
areas on account of their adaptability to mobile operations, and
the constant shell fire which has wrecked many of the wooden
huts.
In the trenches the Y.M.C.A. operates in dugouts, where its
secretaries are exposed to the enemy shellfire. The huts, marquees,
and dugouts are furnished as comfortably as possible, the whole
idea of Y.M.C.A. work being to remind the lads of home. The
best kind of entertainments are run continuously, and everything
possible is done to keep up the spirits of the boys. In Egyot
every camp has a Y.M.C.A., and Australian representatives are
working right with the advanced troops in Palestine.
The Y.M.C.A. direct large canteens on all the fighting fronts
by special arrangement with the British War Office, and the War
Office, and the British Food Commissioners supervise the issuing
of all supplies to the Y.M.C.A. canteens, and also fix the prices
for goods. All charges, therefore, are rigidly under milita.y
regulation, no more and no less, but free distribution of comforts
is made to the men in the trenches, to the walking wounded, and
during a “hop-over.” In the billet areas, and in the camps behind
the fighting lines, canteen goods are sold at practically cost prices,
any profits being devoted to the upkeep of the free distribution
work.
The Y.M.C.A. canteen work, a huge responsibility, has been
undertaken solely for the benefit of the soldiers, who in thousands
express their gratitude that this service has saved them from the
exhorbitant charge of village shopkeepers. For itself, the Associa-
tion makes no pecuniary profit whatever from any branch of its
service to the men. So far as the British Y.M.C.A. is concerned,
it was recently ,£150,000 overdrawn on account of its war service.
“The men must be served” has been the slogan of the Association
from the moment Great Britain drew the sword and found the
Y.M.C.A. the first organisation ready to accompany the soldiirs
into camp.
Of the nature of the “hut” service, with its provision for the
entertainment, amusement, and recreation of the men, its facilities
for reading and writing,' and so forth, there is no need to speak,
since it is availed of by practically every man in the Australian
Army.
In the trenches themselves, and in the areas between the
trenches and the casualty clearing stations, the Y.M.C.A. provides
hot coffee, tea, cocoa, biscuits, cigarettes, lemonade, etc., to the
soldiers free. In an advance area in a trench line in France, in a
few days one of the secretaries gave away 105,250 articles of com-
fort and refreshment. £2,500 per month is now being expended
on this service.
The whole of this service, which the military authorities describe
as indispensable, is provided by the Y.M.C.A. for a little less


Y.M.C.A, Dug-Out, Advanced Post. Thousands of men are supplied with
hot drinks, etc., from these dug-outs.




than £1 per year for each soldier. Large extensions are planned
for the coming twelve months.
A big Australian social centre in London has been inaugurated
by securing Aldwych Theatre. This theatre is one of the most
select in London, and splendidly adapted for the purpose. It is a
Godsend to all Australian boys on leave in London. There is
practically a continuous programme, with the cafe and all con-
venience.
In France the Association has made similar provision for the
boys on leave. Well-equipped buildings have been secured in
Paris and Havre, and these provide a real up-to-date social centre
for Australians, where everything possible is done to help and
entertain.
There are over two thousand five hundred social centres in
various war zones; in France alone there are over five hundred
at different points. Besides this the Association has between 40 and
50 cinemas in operation for the entertainment of the troops. The
supply of free writing material alone costs the Association .£1,050
per week.
This service is meeting the needs of men of every creed and
nationality, and hundreds of thousands of men are having their
spare time filled with entertainment, and find privileges in home-
like surroundings under the roof of the .“Red Triangle.”

Y.M.C.A. CLUB FOR SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.
The Club was opened on 10th June, 1916, by His Excellency
Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, in the presence of Her Excellency
Lady Helen Munro Ferguson, the State Governor (Sir Arthur
Stanley), the Lord Mayor, the Chairman of the Parks’ Committee,
and a large and representative gathering of ladies and geltlemen.
The object of the club is to provide a place for rest and amuse-
ment for the men when off duty. Refreshments are provided at a
very small cost in a beautiful dining-room. In 18 months 248,947
meals have been served to soldiers and sailors, which gives some
idea of the popularity of the club. All the work in connection with
the refreshments is willingly carried out by a large staff of volun-
tary lady workers, who have their regular times of attendance,
and bring to it a homelike atmosphere and influence.
In addition to the refreshment room, a commodious lounge is
comfortably furnished with easy chairs, a library consisting of
over 2,000 well-chosen books, illustrated magazines and daily and
weekly papers ; also a .fine piano, pianola and gramophone. Con-
cert parties frequently entertain the men during the lunch-hour.
Three full-sized billiard tables are in constant use, and writing
facilities are also provided, as many as 2,000 letters being posted in
a week, paper and envelopes being provided free of charge. Hot
and cold showers may be obtained.
In addition to providing for our own Australian soldiers, the
workers have been delighted from time to time to cater for special
men passing through Melbourne—Japanese sailors, returned sick
French soldiers, French soldiers and New Zealanders en route to
the front, for whom special entertainment has been provided.
To the returned discharged men the club has proved a boon,
especially to those, who have not yet found employment, or are
unfitted for it.
On Xmas Day all soldiers and returned discharged men were
the guests of the club, and a real Xmas dinner was provided, the
workers showing unflagging interest in doing all to make it really
homelike and enjoyable for the men.
The club is managed by an executive of gentlemen who look
after the business arrangements, and a committee of ladies for the
organising of voluntary workers and the refreshment department.
The members of the Executive are—Messrs. G. C. Arnold
(Chairman), J. M. Gillespie, Newman Barker, T. Thomas, C. F.
Crosby, T. H. Maddock, J. Adcock, H. E. Wootton, and A. E. A.
Aston (Hon. Secretary).

Y.M.C.A. SNAPSHOTS-FROM-HOME LEAGUE.
The Y.M.C.A. Snapshots-from-Home League is an organisation
of amateur photographers created by the Y.M.C.A. with the object
of providing men and nurses on active service with little snap-
shots of their own homes, relatives and friends.
Briefly, the idea is to get home photographs to send to our men
in camps and hospitals, in the fighting zones and in the Navy—
photographs of their own homes and loved ones, which will carry
a special significance, maintain the home touch, and keep ever
before them the homes and ideals for which they are fighting.
Application forms are provided at post offices, picture theatres,
fetes, carnivals, etc. They are also sent to local camps, and are
now being distributed among our soldiers, sailors and nurses
abroad. Each outgoing troopship carries an adequate supply of
forms.
■The application form is filled in with particulars of where the
snapshot is to be taken, and for whom, and is sent either to the
local secretary or to the organising secretary for the State con-
cerned. In the latter case it is sent on to the local secretary, who
in his turn forwards it to the member nearest the address given.
The member writes explaining the work of the League, and mak-
ing an appointment, then calls and takes the snapshot. In due
course copies of the snapshots are handed to the home, one for
each representative on active service, and one for retention in the
home. On the back of each snapshot is placed a “League Seal.”
The snapshots to be sent away are placed in a neat, strong wallet,
on the back of which is space for the name and address of the
voluntary worker, together with a note saying that snapshots are
forwarded with such worker’s good wishes. All this is done free
of cost, the members themselves providing their own material.
Although many applications have been received for snapshots,
the great majority of the work done is procured by the members
themselves. Honour Rolls are examined, and the relatives of the
men whose names appear thereon visited. Many extra snapshots
have been taken through personal canvass in various districts.
In some instances in the country arrangements have been made
for a carload of members to visit an outlying district, says from 4.0
to 60 miles distant, where the members spend the afternoon in
taking snapshots of the relatives of those who have gone to the
front. Kyneton (Vic.) was the first branch in Australia to organise
an outing of this kind.
From the following table showing the work done by the various
States throughout Australia it will be seen that Victoria holds
pride of place :

Numbers of letters have been received from nurses and men
expressing- appreciation of the work of the League. Returned men
are unanimous in urging members to continue this cheering work.
The results achieved by the League are particularly satisfactory
in view of the increased cost of photographic materials and the
many calls on time and energy for patriotic work in other direc-
tions. The work done by members of the various States represents
an intrinsic contribution in the form of snapshots which must
closely approximate ,£4,000. This represents only the monetary
aspect, besides which there is the sacrifice of time, and, in many
cases, the expense and inconvenience of travelling. Special praise
is due to the enthusiasm and energy displayed by members in
their keen desire to do all they can to cheer our men and nurses.
Extract from a letter from General Sir William Birdwood,
K.C.F.1., R.C.M.G., C. 8., C. 1.8., D. 5.0., to Mr. McTaggart,
Organising Secretary, South Australia:
“I have been very pleased to receive your letter of the 17th
October, and am greatly interested in all you tell me regarding
the Y.M.C.A. Snapshots-from-Home League, with the object of
which I so fully agree. . . I cannot think of anything that would
be so eagerly welcomed by our men as photographs of those who
are dear to them in Australia. . . This is perhaps not fully
realised among those who see each other daily, but it is after such
a long separation as most of us have experienced in this war that
the photographs of relatives would be so much appreciated here,
and the fact that your organisation caters for “homely snaps”
must add to their value. . . I wish you all success in what is cer-
tainly a big undertaking in the interests of our men, who have so
thoroughly deserved everything that one can possibly do towards
ameliorating the great sacrifice they are making in the service of
their country.”

LEAGUE OF SOLDIERS’ FRIENDS.
(Melbourne Diocese.)
The League was originally formed at a meeting convened by
the Archbishop and held at the Chapter House on 22nd March, 1917.
A constitution was adopted by the Council of the Diocese on
3rd August, 1917, and by the contributors at a meeting held on
16th August, 1917.
The League has grown steadily since its formation, and now
has between 80 and 90 branches, with a membership roll of about
5,000.
There are still about 40 parishes in the Diocese of Melbourne
which have not formed branches, but it is hoped that the majority of
them, will link on with the movement during the course of this year.
The League has proved its value in a twofold way:
In the first place, it has enabled a large number of church
people to directly participate in work for the soldiers bv visitation
at the military hospitals, parish social work, assisting at Cathedral
Institute, and in other directions.
And it has, through membership fees and other finan-
cial support, assisted the Church in maintaining its varied work
amongst our fighting men.
Some of the branches have shown exceptional activity, and it is
gratifying to know that their efforts are fully appreciated by ti e
soldiers.
The League has opened two new Institutes during the year—
one at the Isolation Camp, Ascot Vale, and the other in the Domain
Camp. Both of these were dedicated by the Archbishop, and
supply a much-needed want, the Ascot Vale building in particular
being of special value to those recovering from sickness.
We are much indebted to Mr. F. Arthur Moule for a donation of
,£5OO from a trust fund under his control to the funds of the League.
Huts for our boys in France have not been forgotten by your
Board, the sum of ,£BOO having been cabled for the erection of two
of them under the supervision and management of the Church
Army in England. The League is deeply indebted to two ladies
of the diocese who most generously undertook the*entire respon-
sibility for this outlay. The sum of .£lOO was also given by the
League to Chaplain Wray’s appeal for church huts in France. We
are under obligation to the C.E.M.S. for its kind help in rendering
financial assistance, arranging a military concert in the Melbourne
Town Hall, and also for entertainments at various camps. It is
pleasing for the League to learn that the C.E.M.S. have also been
enabled to erect a hut at the front.
The League has assisted troopship chaplains by supplying them
with soldiers’, requisites for the voyage, such as games, books,
athletic material, etc.
The following Institutes are maintained under the auspices of
the League:—Cathedral Institute, Broadmeadows Institute, Mari


bymong Institute,. Ascot Vale Institute, Domain Institute, Lang-
warrin Institute.
Military chaplains have been stationed at Broadmeadows, Mari-
bymong, Ascot Vale, Caulfield and Base Hospitals, at Langwarrin,
and also at McLeod Sanatorium and Portsea.
On December 31st there was a credit balance in hand, as shown
by the financial statement, of ,£798/17/-.
The Board of Managers is fully impressed with the vital import-
ance of a vigorous programme of work for the immediate future,
both abroad and in the diocese.
It hopes to get into closer personal touch with the chaplains at
the front, and through them to extend its work amongst the Aus-
tralian soldiers in France, Egypt and elsewhere.

CHURCH OF ENCLAND SOLDIERS’ INSTITUTE, MELBOURNE
More than three years ago, and within five months of the out-
break of war, the Church of England provided a city resort for sol-
diers on leave in Melbourne. Direct touch has thus been secured
with thousands of men preparing for and returning from active
service. A large tent was erected in the grounds of St. Paul’s
Cathedral in January, 1915, and- was crowded at its opening by
hundreds of members of the Bth Light Horse (a regiment that won
imperishable fame at Lone Pine on Gallipoli). An article in the
“Argus” of February 20th, 1915, on “National Moral in War”
contains this reference to the tent: —“We are not slow to criticise
the few men from Broadmeadows who give way to indulgence dur-
ing their time of leave. To do so is grossly unfair. What bene-
ficent influence is to be found in the streets of Melbourne filled
with pleasure-seekers, and with the exception of the Church of
England Tent, offering no hospitality except that of hotels.”
The present Institute, in size 90 feet long and 33 feet wide, took
the place of the tent in July, 1915. It is excellently equipped for the
comfort of the men. Electric fans for the summer and radiators
for the winter are installed It is open daily (Sundays included)
from 10 a.m. to 10.30 p.m.,- and has been freely used by soldiers
in training and visitors from all the Australian States and New
Zealand, and returned warriors from New Guinea, Gallipoli, the
West Front, Egypt and Palestine. The benefits are for men of all
denominations, who obtain free from all charge cloakroom facili-
ties, restful chairs and lounges, reading matter and writing
materials. When services have been held on Sunday, opportunity
to retire has been given to those who so desired. A small charge
is made for billiards and refreshments (available at any time). A
dinner of three courses is provided daily (Sundays included) at a
cost of sixpence each. An average of 80 men daily partake of this
meal. From these charges and donations it has been possible to
meet all expenses, and in addition make regular contributions to
the League of Soldiers’ Friends, the work of the Institute being a
branch of the activities of that League.
Since 1915, the landing on Gallipoli has been commemorated
each year by the attendance of returned Anzacs at a special service
in the Cathedral, and afterwards at dinner in the Institute. On
each occasion the building has been crowded to the fullest extent.
All soldiers have also been entertained each Christmas Day. The
following extract from a letter of a country soldier to the paper of
his district indicates the gratitude felt:—“About 450 soldiers par-
took of Christmas dinner. . . The dinner was excellent. It was
just heavenly the way those good people worked in their efforts to
extend hospitality to those boys; and though they were- absent
from their homes and loved ones, they were made to feel that they
were truly welcome.”
Soldiers have freely expressed in the visitors’ book their appre-
ciation of the Institute“ Just what was required.” “A great
benefit to soldiers.” “A good substitute for home in the midst
of turmoil.” The success of the work is mainly due to the happy
spirit of unity prevailing amongst the lady workers, who have
been able to create about the whole work the atmosphere of home.

CAMBERWELL TRINITY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH GIRLS’
SOCIAL CLUB.
There are one hundred members on the roll, and our work is

Trinity Presbyterian Church. Since the inception of the club we
have knitted 1,626 comforts, besides making towels, shirts and
pillow cases. A gift evening resulted in 21 billies being packed for
the soldiers in Egypt, and several boxes were sent to the Navy.
We have also sent large parcels of socks to Chaplains Rolland,
Crookston and Mr. Alex. Moodie, of the Y.M.C.A., in Egypt; and
socks and other comforts through Mr. Moore to the sailors in the
North Sea. We have sent to our Church boys and lonely soldiers
204 Xmas boxes. From May, 1916, to September, 1917, ,£389/1/10
has been subscribed to the above objects.

"THE BING GIRLS."
For over two years the Y.M.C.A. have had in their social side
of their work the assistance of a bright little band of entertainers,
known originally as the “Cheero’s,” now brought more up to date
under the title of the “Bing Girls.” Under the management of
Miss Peggy Donaldson, these artists have visited Broadmeadows,
Royal Park, Domain, 'Mont Park, Isolation Camp, Point Cook, etc.,
wherever they thought they could brighten the hours of the soldier
boy. Unfortunately Miss Donaldson has been compelled to give


up the leadership of the “Bing Girls,” but is still a member of the
company, and she has found an able substitute in Miss Gunn.
The “Bing Girls” give a vivacious little show of good quality.
The procuring of dainty costumes has proved a great attraction,
and these and some stage properties add to the company’s already
bright work. At the final curtain they pelt the audience with
flowers, streamers, and occasionally parcels of cigarettes, which
has always been warmly responded to by the boys.

the manufacture of 100 dozen shirts, which were required by the
boys who sailed away for New Guinea. These were made for the
Lady Mayoress’s Patriotic League, and the order was executed in
about six hours, which was a good performance, as, at that time,
expedition was most urgent. Since then the work has been con-
tinued, the staff having cheerfully given their time and labour,
while the proprietors have placed the plant, etc., at their disposal.
Altogether something over 20,000 garments have been produced,
and these must have played an important part in providing some


measure of comfort for the boys, both in the trenches and the
hospital. The following are the names of some of the workers:

"CHEER-UP” BRICADE.
The interest of the “Cheer-Up” Brigade lies in the fact that it
was the first attempt to organise the children of Melbourne into a
permanent band of patriotic workers. The idea was first conceived
by Mrs. MacLaren, and with the co-operation of Mrs. Collins and
Miss Adam, the work was started in November, 1914.
T ean McLaren, Brian Collins and Alex. Brewer were the first
children in the Brigade, and each was asked to bring a new
member. In two days we had a membership of 75 children. A
patriotic button was made for the members, and the maker informs
us that it was the first patriotic button made in Australia. These
badges are in all parts of the world with soldiers who have been
entertained, and some of the children at Harefield Council School
wear them when delivering papers at the hospital. A regular
supply of papers are sent to the soldiers in hospital there.
When the Royal Park Camp was opened in 1915, the “Cheer
Up” work was taken up by adult friends of the children, and
afternoon tea given every day to all men on guard. On Sunday
afternoon all men were given a substantial tea, and when this
camp was closing we were told that our work had been of great
help to the military authorities, and asked if it would be possible
to work at Broadmeadows. Some 50 soldiers remained at Royal
Park Camp for the final clear up, and a substantial dinner was
cooked and served the last Sunday, at the Y.M.C.A. Institute. Hot
scone and coffee supper and fruit soirees were given to many
hundreds of soldiers.
The work is now proceeding at Broadmeadows, Ascot Vale,
Maribyrnong and Domain Camps, and week-ends are brightened
for soldiers who are compelled to remain in camp.
MARIBYRNONC.
The Maribyrnong branch of the “Cheer-Up” Brigade was in
the hands, of Mrs.' H. Adam and Mrs. Dowie for a long time.
These ladies are now entertaining returned soldiers one afternoon
a month in the Essendon Hall. The concerts and social atmos-
phere of these welcomes is greatly appreciated by the organisers!
as well as by the boys.


ISOLATION CAMP, ASCOT VALE.
Mrs. W. T. Osborne, Matron-in-charge; Mrs. C. Shields, Vice.
Matron.
This branch was formed in April, 1917. It provides Saturday
afternoon tea to all men in camp, whether sick or on duty, an
aggregate of 10,000 single teas to soldiers having been given
during the past year. In this camp no leave is given, and the tea
is arranged on mess trays and distributed to the several compounds
and messes by the camp orderlies. Each man is practically
rationed, so that all may share alike.

DAYLESFORD AND DISTRICT SOLDIERS’ SUNSHINE CLUB.
The above club was formed in May, 1917, for the purpose of
individually providing comforts to local boys on service. Member’s
fee is fixed at 1/- per month, and at present the club consists of
eighteen girls, who meet at the club room three times a week for
the purpose of packing parcels, and once to discuss business
matters. 240 parcels, each valued at 10/-, have been sent
away, and members have had the satisfaction of receiving numer-
ous letters of acknowledgement from recipients.

DUNRAVEN KITCHEN.
The Dunraven Kitchen was started at the Victoria Barracks
on July 15th, 1915. Mrs. George Fairbairn, President; Mrs. T.
Alston, Treasurer; Miss Dufrayee, Secretary; Committee, Mrs. J.
Alston, Miss Dufrayee, Mrs. Barry Thomson, Mrs. Arthur
Payne, Mrs. W. Howard Smith, Mrs. Ross Soden, Mrs. Walter
Manifold, Mrs. T. Ledingham; also a number of ladies who
brought donations and waited on the soldiers. An appeal was
made in the “Argus” and “Age,” which was generously responded
to in money and goods. After four months the room at the Bar-
racks was found too small for the number of men, so another room
was opened at Sturt-street Recruiting Depot in November, 1915,
and we gave tea and light refreshment to 51,487 men, and on one
day in March we had 1,000 men. Owing to so few recruits we had
to close our kitchen at the end of 1916. In 1917 the Dunraven
Kitchen started a fund for the Anzac Buffet, which at this time
was badly in need of funds. We cabled .£l,OOO to them, and have
another .£1,500 to send.

Ethel Cunningham and Miss Lilias Thomson, of Upper Macedon,
assisted by the Misses Connie Cunningham, Monte and Gena
Thomson, Mrs. Harry Gordon, Mrs. Dudley Detmold, and the


Misses Cobb, Campbell, Murray Jones, McLean and Keep. The
depot, after six months trial, is supplying 125 families weekly with
vegetables, fresh eggs, potatoes, etc., and the number of appli-
cants , grows daily, the fresh fruit and vegetables being much
appreciated by the soldiers’ dependents.

IRISH SPINNING CICLE.
In 1915, good wool being unprocurable, Madame McCracken,
recalling her childhood’s memories, started hand spinning in Mrs.
Anderson’s coachhouse, Toorak, given up to her for the purpose
of perfecting the art, and in which she soon made great strides.
She elected to use the old Irish wool wheel, which she got made
under her verbal instructions (no drawings), and in four days’
time was spinning with it on Australia Day, 30th July, in a room
in Elizabeth House, kindly lent by the Arts and Crafts, the result
being £6/1 /-, which was sent to Lady Stanley’s Wounded Soldiers’
Fund, and reported in all local papers. Since then the wheels are
in use in all the States and New Zealand. Exhibitions have been
given at various Red Cross branches and country towns, both in
wool and flax spinning, in order to stimulate industries for re-
turned soldiers and their families. The weaving is going on at
Flinders Buildings for the same purposes, the accommodation
kindly lent by the Bank of -Victoria. Foy and Gibson’s donated
spinning wool. They also donated the reeds and heddles for the
loom, to help patriotic work. Mr. Miller, their weaving mill
manager, fixed up the loom. Dalgety’s donated wool for the spin-
ning, and the Albion scribbled it free of cost for comforts for the
soldiers.

AUSTRALASIAN LEAGUE OF HONOUR FOR WOMEN
AND GIRLS.
Patroness i Lady Helen Munro Ferguson.
The League of Honour for Women and Girls of the British
Empire was formed after the outbreak of war in 1914, with head-
quarters in London. Its object is to uphold the standard of
women’s duty and honour during the most intense mental and
spiritual crisis through which the Empire has ever passed. In
April, 1915, a Central Council was formed ip Sydney to forward the
aims of the League throughout Australasia. Motto: “Strength and
Honour.” Badge: The banner of St. George, the soldier saint,
encircled by a wreath of laurel, the whole surrounded by the words
“Australasian League of Honour, 1915.”

EMPLOYEES OP LONDON TIE COMPANY, 46 RUSSELL ST.
The employees of the above firm commenced voluntary work and
collections in June, 1915, and hope to continue until the time when
war work will be no longer needed. The sum collected from June,
1915, till November, 1917, amounted to and the money
was spent in various ways for the benefit of our soldiers at home
and abroad. To the Base Hospital, St. Kilda-road, has been sent
a generous supply of linen, also one bagatelle table. To the
Caulfield Military Hospital were sent two bagatelle tables, two
lounges, six dozen beaded net covers and cigarettes. To the
boys abroad have been sent 200 pairs of good woollen socks, the
wool being supplied from our funds, and knitted by the girls in
their spare time. For Christmas, 1917, there were forwarded to
personal friends of the workers 74 good and useful parcels. In
May, 1917, the sum of -f.5 was sent to the Anzac Buffet Fund,
and to the First Aid Yeomanry Detachment in France the sum of
£5 and a parcel containing 22 pairs of socks.
Apart from the funds, by the efforts of the workers and their
friends, in answer to an appeal made for hospital bags, they were
able to send 32 bags filled to overflowing with dainties and useful
gifts to our wounded soldiers abroad for Xmas, 1915. Some time
later many letters were received from those who had received the
bags, thanking all for giving them a pleasant surprise. The
average number of workers is about 74, including four men.

PEOPLE’S LIBERAL PARTY.
The People’s Liberal Party have since the beginning of the
war carried out patriotic voluntary work as an organisation, in
addition to that done independently by each member of the Party.
In October, 1914, at the mass meeting of women in the Melbourne
Town Hall, 2,000 women were registered for Social Service. The
branches have sent in large quantities of all kinds of comforts,
both to the Belgian Kerugees, to the Red Cross, and to the Lady
Mayoress’s Patriotic League. Members have collected on seven
Button Days, also on Lucky Bag Day and Our Boys’ Day, and
up to the present in our section have reached ;£1,500. The Exe-
cutive also worked for the Edith Cavell Fund, and is represented
on the committee. The Party initiated the Empire Trade Defence
Association, asking the Lady Mayoress to convene the first meet-
ing. The Empire Trade Defence Association is quite non-partv,
numbering among its executive and members all shades of poli-
tical opinion. The Labor Party is represented on the executive.
A War Savings Group was started in September, and over ;£4OO
has been subscribed. To Mrs. Alfred Deakin, a prominent mem-
ber of the Party, and to Mrs. Macmillan is due the establishment
of the soldiers’ refreshment stall at the Base Hospital, where so
many soldiers have been fed and looked after for the last three
years. Miss Vera Deakin, another member, is Secretary of the
Australian Branch of the Red Cross Enquiry Bureau in London,
with Miss Brotherton, of the Castlemaine Branch, as Assistant
Secretary. The officers of the organisation are:—Mrs. Victor

THE PURPLE CROSS SERVICE OF VICTORIA,
The above service was formed shortly after the outbreak of war
by Miss Maud Harvie, of Melbourne, and very quickly assumed
large proportions the appeals made on behalf of'wounded horses
finding a ready response from the general public, whose sympathy
has been with the movement from its inception. The work done
by the Purple Cross Service is essentially for Australian horses
abroad, and laflge sums of money have been donated from time to
time to various veterinary hospitals in France, and numerous com-
forts in the way of bandages, rugs, fodder bags have from time
to time been forwarded to such places where Australian horses
are serving. The work is still going on, and arrangements have
been made for a suuply of rugs, fodder bags, veterinary instru-
ments and cash to be forwarded during 1918. The work connected
with the above is undertaken by the members in a purely honorary
capacity, no fees or salaries of any kind being paid by the Service.
All goods are forwarded to military officers for distribution from
the various centres of activity.

WORK OF THE SOCIETE MATERNELLE IN FRANCE.
When the war began, many women about to become mothers
found themselves alone. Thousands of them had lost husband,
home, everything. The necessity of helping them inspired the
formation of this Society, and was brought under the notice of the
general public, so that all women, both those who might be bene-
fited by the scheme and those who might give their services to the
work, should come forward at once. The response was magni-
ficent, all voluntary women workers who had hitherto been engaged
in private relief work placed themselves unreservedly at the disposal
of the committee, and were organised as volunteer brigades. The
following requirements are looked upon as necessaries by the
Society:—Every expectant mother shall be—First, provided with
suitable and sustaining nourishment; second, afforded healthy
lodgings; third, saved from overwork; fourth, provided with
skilled medical guidance. Every woman with a child under three
years of age shall be assisted if necessary. All homeless mothers
will be sent to one of the Homes. If there are several children,
their welfare will be secured by boarding them out in a home or
“Family Nest” during the mothers’ stay in the Maternity Hospital.
The mothers are thus looked after before and after the birth of
their baby. They are kept under our protection. We give them a
home if they have none, food, clothes, medical advice and moral
help.

THE S.R.B.
By Philip Ray.
(Reprinted from “The Argus,” November 25.)
“Is this the place where you get 1/- worth for a penny?” asked
a big soldier.
“It is,” said the pretty girl behind the counter, as she lifted a
huge teapot, and held it poised in mid-air. “Tea, coffee, or
cocoa?” she asked, in the sing-song voice born of long habit.
“Cocoa ” responded the soldier, promptly. “And ”
“Sandwiches —egg or meat?” interrupted another feminine voice
from the farther end of the counter.
“Meat.” Again the reply came promptly. Then, as he sur-
veyed the piled plate before him, he raised his eyebrows. “One
penny for that lot.” He whistled softly. “You won’t make a
fortune out of that, miss.”
“We’re not out to make a fortune,” said the girl brightly, as he
limped away to a table with his load.
Turning to the right, from the double gates leading into the
military hospital on the St. Kilda road, you may come upon as
unique a corner as exists in Melbourne. In the early days of the
war, a group of women, eager to help the suffering, were drawn
towards this hospital to see in what way they might be of use.
One of the earliest visits made clear the need of a buffet, to supply
the men, who were out-patients seeking attention, with something
to sustain them through their sometimes protracted waits. No
sooner was this noted than the work began. It was simple to pro-
cure a teapot, some cups and saucers, an oilstove, and by means
of a little persuasion in the right quarter, a little bell tent for
shelter. And here hospitality was dispensed to the grateful men.
So grateful were they, that the bell tent soon proved an inadequate
shelter, for more men, and yet more, claimed the privilege of being
entertained. But before a move was made, these devoted ladies
laboured through a long, hot summer, preparing sandwiches in
close proximity to an oilstove, giving off fumes and heat, till the
atmosphere in the tent became almost unbearable.
The authorities, who quickly realised the benefit to the men,
set about providing more suitable quarters. And - to-day there
stands “the corner,” or, to be accurate, the S.R.S. (Soldiers’
Refreshment Stall), which has brought comfort in more ways than
one to hundreds of our deserving men. It is only a small strip
of ground, asphalted and roofed, so that it looks like a long veran-
dah. Along one wall runs a counter, which is generally covered
with cups and saucers. In one comer is a grating with big gas
jets for the kettles. Passing this, one gets an appetising smell
of fragrant coffee. Beyond the counter is a table surrounded by
women cutting bread spreading it _ with butter, preparing meat
and eggs for sandwiches, with a quiet, breathless haste and pre-
cision that gives them the appearance of being small parts of a
large, effective machine—a machine that is doing work as effective
in its way as any of the other machines of war. A girl stands at
a bread-cutter, turning the handle swiftly, pausing only to hand a


pile of slices on to the table, where the sandwiches are prepared.
The crash of crockery attracts one farther down the “verandah.”
Behind a screen is the washing-up department. A very neces-
sary one it is, too. Washing-up goes on steadily all day. The
hospital authorities, finding the work increasing so steadily, in-
stalled a hot-water system connected with the hospital. These
luxuries did not appear directly; but by degrees, as the benefits
dispensed in the S.R.S. came to be appreciated, so it was in-
creased in size, and fitted with necessities that helped the workers
to act with more despatch. The work began by attracting a hand-
ful of men, but its popularity increased till the men averaged
nearly five hundred a day.
Let me describe a day. The helpers arrive at a quarter to 10
a.m. The guard at the gate grins appreciatively as he salutes.
(Hardly one of the girls but feels an ever-recurring pride at being
saluted.)
“I’ve got the keys, miss.” One of the men comes forward, and
helps to unlock. Others join him, and a load of 20 long, sweet-
smelling loaves of bread are transferred from the verandah, where
the baker has left them, to the table inside the lattice enclosure.
Twenty pounds of currant cake follows. The milk is emptied into
three huge enamel “billies.” The tables need wiping (it has been
dusty overnight), the sugar basins are put out. Even at this early
hour the men are beginning to drift in for a cup of tea.
“That is good,” says a big, tired-locpking sergeant. “Had to
miss my breakfast.” He looks appreciatively at the steaming cup.
“Come back for more,” says the girl, engrossed in the mystery
of making cocoa in a pot that looks as if it came from a giant’s
kitchen.
The sandwich cutters work briskly, but the men standing round,
three or four deep, absorb their commodity as soon as it is ready.
After an hour there comes a spell from customers, and huge trays
are filled with food and stored away against the “1 o’clock rush.”
One helper takes charge of the pies (by the others considered a
lucky girl), three others wash up, another watches the tables to
clear them of dirty crockery, and to keep the white oilcloth spot-
less. One takes charge of the little tobacco shop, and in hot
weather mixes lemon drinks for those who prefer them to tea.
The “1 o’clock rush” is at its height. Khaki fills the place.
About 50 laughing men surround the girl at the stove with eager
hands extended for pies. The teapot girl has had to call up rein-
forcements, and a second detachment stands behind the counter
with the giant jug of cocoa. The sandwich cutters are standing
at attention and serving out plates of the wares as quickly as deft
hands can do it. Some of the helpers dart in and out amongst the
crowded tables, clearing them of crockery and filling the washing-
up bench, which is being cleared as quickly as it is filled.
“More cups, please,” in an agonised voice from behind the
counter. A tray of cups appears from behind the screen, the
bearer threading her way among the crowd of men with difficulty,
till one observing man, seeing her difficulty, takes the tray from
her, and lifts it over the heads of the men around the counter.
“Tomato sauce' please—under the counter, Mamie,” the pie


girl calls out from her corner, where she is hidden from sight by
the hedge of hungry soldiers. “Thanks. Who’ll open it?” A
dozen hands stretch out, eager to help.
It is all bustle and clatter. Voices rise over the noise of
crockery. “When do you think you’ll get away?” “The shot
came right down through my head—we were charging up hill.”
“I had to go like the wind—I had despatches—how could I slow
down?” “I’m in, yes—the missis came round.” “Like the life?
I should think so. It’s great.” “Get me some cocoa while you’re
there, Jimmy.” “Look out for the matey on the crutches.” “Yes,
I’m going with the big guns.” “You at Lone Pine, too; put it
there;” and so on without end.
The S.R.S. is supplied entirely by voluntary donations. So far
it has not been found necessary to make any appeal to the public.
The S.R.S. is not only a feeding-place, but a place of refuge—a
place of rest—a place where a man knows he may find a ready and
sympathetic listener for his woes and joys alike.
Therefore there are many watching friends who are willing and
ready to give help when it is needed. Wholesale houses have sent
goods—either free or at very low prices. The baker gives half
the bread that is used. As the baker’s bill for a year came to
over .£325, the gift is a valuable one. A friend in the country
sends 50 dozen eggs a week—another sends scones, another helps
with a little butter; one lady sends so many pounds of coffee a
week; a firm generously supplies tea, and many others help in
various ways. But, in spite of these helps, it takes much to pro-
vide 500 men a da' f with food of the best quality. The grocer’s
monthly bill alone of nearly £SO needs some facing, added to which
are bills for pies, ice, milk, lemon squash and all the etceteras that
are needed. A small separate fund is set aside called the Soldier’s
Aid, and from this men are helped, when the need is great and
urgent, either with a loan or a little straight-out help. On the
balance-sheet before me is an item of £43/11/6, which represents
small sums that have been repaid. As these sums rarely exceed
10/-, and practically no claim is ever put forward for the return, I
think that entrv speaks for itself. This little fund has lightened
many a load. Each case finds it so easy to be heard and verified.
There is no creaking of machinery or red tape. A woman who
gives all her time and sympathy, and who is easily approached by
all in need, is found all that is necessary.
It was the kindness of a generous woman who made the begin-
ning possible with a substantial cheque, and money has nevet
been laid out to better advantage. Every penny given reaches the
object for which it is given with absolutely no deductions. All the
work done is quite voluntary.

THE SOUTHERN CROSS TOBACCO FUND.
The Over-Seas Club Southern Cross Tobacco Fund, as its
name indicates, is a fund which exists solely for the purpose of
providing tobacco and cigarettes for the fighters at the front. It
is Australia’s part in the gigantic effort which the Over-Seas Club
at the outbreak of war inaugurated throughout the British Empire
in order to provide comfprts for the soldiers.
The fund was established in Australia in 1916, and is now car-
ried on Under the personal supervision of Mr. F. 1. Cox, General
Manager of Messrs. Gordon and Gotch Proprietary Limited, Mel-
bourne, while with him have been associated Mr. R. Ainge-John-
son, General Organiser for Australia, and Miss D. L. Payter,
Secretary.
In Western Australia the local work of the fund has been con-
ducted by the Victoria League Tobacco Sub-Committee of the
Victoria League’s Trench Comforts Committee, of which the Rev.
C. L. Riley is Chairman, and Mr. S. V. Eaton, Hon. Secretary.
In Queensland Alderman H. T. Diddams, C.M.G., was appointed
by the Government to represent the Fund in that State. In Tas-
mania Mr. H. T. Gould, President of the Hobart Branch of the
Over-Seas Club, and Mr. S. Dobson-Hesp, Assistant Hon. Secre-
tary, have teen instrumental in sending large sums of money to
the English headquarters of the movement. In New South Wales
Sir Thomas Anderson Stuart, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at
Sydney University, is President of the Over-Seas Club Southern
Cross Tobacco Fund, New South Wales Committee, and Mr. Alex.
Gray is Hon. Secretary.
Since its inception over £ 200,000 has been collected by the
Over-Seas Club for tobacco comforts for the troops, to which the
Southern Cross Tobacco Fund, which has collected shillings for
the fighters from Darwin, in the north, to Broome, in the west,
has contributed approximately ,£40,000. The whole of this sum has
been spent on the purchase of tobacco and cigarettes for the troops,
not one penny having been deducted for expenses. The head
office in Australia is at 120 Queen Street, Melbourne, where col-
lection lists may be obtained.
SYMPATHETIC LEAGUE.
When the casualty lists come out we go through them, and if
there are any Port Melbourne boys’ names in it, we then visit the
home of wife or mother and show practical sympathy by seeing
that dependents do not want either for money or from lack of
knowledge of the procedure for arranging pension claims and other
Defence matters. In doing this wives and mothers of our soldiers
and sailors ought to be drawn into closer union with one another.

WOOL SPINNING GUILD.
The Wool Spinning' Guild of Melbourne was started under the
presidency of Lady Creswell in September, 1915, at the Depot,
Room 5, Second Floor, the Block, Elizabeth-street. Its object is
to produce by hand-spinning a good knitting yarn at a reasonable
price, for the benefit of those knitters whose work is being curtailed
by the high price of wool.
The wheels principally used by the Guild were designed by Mr.
Bayley, of the Colonial Ammuntion Co., and made by the men of
the Newport Workshops and the Colonial Ammunition Co., and
presented to the Guild for patriotic work. The members of the
Guild are taught hand-spinning by the ladies of the committee
at the Depot, and they then hire a wheel from the Guild for a
small fee, so that the work can be done in their own homes.
Carded wool is provided free to members, who return the spun
yarn to the Depot, where it is graded and sold for knitting into
comforts for soldiers only. Each spinner has a right to nominate
a buyer, and at present the orders from these buyers are absorb-’
ing nearly all the yarn produced. Up to the end of March, 1918,
1,474 pounds of wool have been spun, which represents sufficient
yarn to knit over 4,000 pairs of socks. A large amoubt of work
has also been done in teaching people from various country dis-
tricts of all the State who come to the Depot for instruction and
advice on spinning and obtaining wheels. These country visitors
are not members of the Guild, and spin their <pwn wool for their
own knitting, but they are always invited to visit the Depot and
compare the work of different spinners.

INDIVIDUAL WORKERS.
RODNEY WILLIAM HALIFAX, Honorary Representative
Y.M.C.A. (Melbourne), Town Hall, Dandenong, Victoria.
Dr. J. LEVIN has been an active war worker and organiser
almost from the time of the outbreak of war. He gave consider-
able time to recruiting work at the Town Hall, where he enrolled
hundreds of recruits. It was not however till the time of the
“Kyarra” fiasco that he saw his opportunity of doing something
big. It was he who suggested to the Defence Department the
idea of organising the privately-owned motor cars with which to
bring away from the hospital ships the sick and wounded and con-
valescent soldiers. This suggestion was accepted, and Dr. Levin
was deputed to organise for the next ship, the “Ballarat,” siflce
torpedoed. The manner in which he mobilised, in a few hours,
sixty privately owned and driven cars, and the way the men were
“taken off” and set down at the Base Hospital, was most favour-
ably commented upon bv the press. Dr. Levin also brought into
existence (through the generosity of the motor car owners) the
idea of motor trios for the wounded and convalescent soldiers.
His next big effort of organisation was to start a National Thrift
work in conjunction with the Lady Mayoress’s Patriotic League,
and which is now known as the Metals Branch, 182 Collins-
street. This is a most flourishing branch, and is growing daily in
importance. On behalf of the Minister for Defence, Dr. Levin
collected, recorded and forwarded to the Ordnance Department,
426 pairs of field glasses for the use of officers of the A.I.F.

February, 1917, and donated .£5O to the Y.M.C.A. and £5O to the
Malvern Red Cross Branch. As Hon. Secretary and Organiser of
fete held in December, 1917, in aid of the Malvern Branch of the

BRIGHTON BEACH.
The branch was formed in August, 1914, with a membership of
about 50, which had increased to over 80 in 1917. Since its incep-
tion weekly meetings have been held at the residence of the presi-
dent, and an average yearly output of over 10,000 articles has been
forwarded to the Central Depot. During three years the income
of this branch has reached over £I,OOO, which has been devoted
mainly to the purchase of raw materials to make garments for our
soldiers. The society has also endowed a cot at the Caulfield
Military Hospital, and has made sundry contributions to other


war organisations. President, Mrs. Eustace Flannagan; Hon.

This branch of the Red Cross Society consists of six local
working committees, embracing men’s and women’s sections, and
the Camberwell "Convalescent Home for Soldiers; these seven
bodies send delegates to a Central Executive Committee, which
meets monthly at the Camberwell Town Hall, having the mayor of
the city as president, and executive officers elected at the annual
meeting. The reports presented by all the sub-sections show that
the amount of work accomplished during this year is considerably
in advance of last year’s output. A list showing the number and
variety of articles forwarded to the Central Depot is appended.
The greatest event of the year as regards concerted effort and
financial results is undoubtedly the second City of Camberwell
Carnival. For the success of this effort, Sir Robert and Lady Best,
together with Mr. H. P. Ogilvie and Mr. G. Coghill, assisted by
a large body of citizens, were responsible. The thanks of the
society were expressed by the Mayor (Cr. Read) at a musical even-
ing held on July last, when Lady Best formally handed over a
cheque for .£3,050, the net result of the carnival, being about
£SOO greater than that realised at the previous carnival.
The regular collections have also been maintained, no less than
117 ladies being engaged in this work through the city, the sum
realised by this means being -0,056. We have again to express
our thanks to these ladies, whose valuable assistance goes so far
towards maintaining the success of the branch.
Cr. Vear, having been elected Mayor of Camberwell in August,
occupies the position of President of the society in succession to
Cr. Read. It is difficult to express the immense interest which Cr.
Read has always shown in the work of the Red Cross Society,
whether as president and vice-president of the branch or as chair-
man of our Convalescent Home. No amount of work has been too
great nor any detail too small to call forth his assistance and
sympathy.
We have again to report a most successful year at “Highton.”
It may not be generally known that this branch, in conjunction
with the municipal council, is /responsible for the upkeep of
“Highton,” the Camberwell Convalescent Home for Soldiers,
situated at Mont Albert Road, Balwyn, This Home is unique, in-
asmuch as it is the only place of the kind in Victoria for which a
local Red Cross Society is responsible with no assistance from the
Defence Department. The Home is managed by a committee of
residents, with Mrs. J. T. Hemphill as hon. secretary, and is so
carefully worked that the maintenance expenses are almost in-
credibly low. At the same time nothing which can add to the
comfort and well-being of the men is omitted. The committee is
indebted to Mr. and Mrs. Doery, who have most generously lent
their beautiful home for the use of our returned heroes. Practically
all the domestic work is done voluntarily by young ladies of ihe
district. Two ladies (professionals) give their skill and service in
massage, and the positions of honorary medical officers are filled
by well-known doctors. Too much cannot be said of the matron
and her assistants, whose praises aie continually being sounded
by the men themselves and their relations. At least one of our
local sections has- maintained a monthly “Cake Day” during the


year, when workers have been in attendance to receive gifts of
cakes and biscuits for the Home.
A fresh avenue of usefulness to which our women workers have
been able to devote time and energy is in assisting at the Red
Cross Kitchen, St. Kilda-road. The Camberwell Branch under-
took, in November last, to supply workers at the kitchen every
Friday. Some of our ladies have proved so valuable to the lady
superintendent that they have been asked to attend on special days,
when it is stated that it is no uncommon thing for meals to be
prepared for 300 or 400 men in one day, it will be seen that the
effort involved is very real.
This society has acted as a Button Day Committee on four
occasions during the year, viz., “Win-the-War,” “Anzac,” “British
Red Cross,” “Italian Red Cross” Days, and also co-operated in
the Lord Mayor’s Xmas Appeal for Belgian Babies.
In addition to the usual routine of work despatched to the Cen-
tral Depot, we have had special requisitions during the year for
housewifes, Balacalava helmets and sheets. Although the time
given for the completion of each of these orders was very short, we
were able to accomplish the work well ahead of the specified date
on each occasion.
A change in the method of working of the branch was brought
about in December, 1916, when it was resolved that flannel and
wool should be bought in quantity, stored at the Town Hall, and
distributed thence to the sections as required. Mrs. Fawcett was
appointed buyer for wool, and carried out the duties until May,
1917, when she relinquished the position. A special meeting of the
executive committee was held, at which Mrs. Fawcett’s resignation
was received with regret, and a motion carried expressing appre-
ciation of her valuable services.
Since December 19th, 1916, when the existing arrangements
commenced, to September 30th, 1917, 23,983 yards of flannel, and
5,863 pounds of wool have passed through the storeroom at the
Town Hall. The physical effort entailed in the handling of these
large stocks has been no small one, but it has been cheerfully
undertaken by one of our vice-presidents for the sake of the cause.
The society is deeply indebted to Crs. Bowley and Mcßeath,
whose intimate knowledge of conditions in the softgoods market
has enabled this committee to obtain materials at the very best
possible advantage.
In common with all other branches, the activities of our men’s
sub-sections have been curtailed owing; to restrictions placed on
shipping, so that the greater part of their work has been in assist-
ing with the erection' of stalls, etc., at the carnival and other
efforts, making of cases in which to pack old linen and in keeping
“Highton” in repair.

CARLTON.
This branch came into existence in May, 1915. It began with
a good number, who at first were very enthusiastic, but in a short
time the numbers began to fall off, and giving up was considered.
However a few held on, and things improved. There are now
about 36 regular members. There are weekly contributions, and
occasionally some kind of entertainment is held to augment the
funds, and there is always enough to keep going. Nearly 2,000
articles have been made and despatched. One of the members has
raised for the branch and her depot the sum of £2O by making
and selling articles, such as iron-holders and quilts made from
pieces.

CASTLE MAINE.
Since its inception, a few days after the war began, this branch
has established a highly creditable record of work done. The
branch has collected £'2,040, and 13,152 garments have been dis-
tributed. A story both pathetic and inspiring has been reported
by one of our collectors. It is a story exemplifying child-like faith,
fine unselfishness and devotion to the cause of the wounded sol-
diers. The sufferings of the wounded soldiers had very early
made an appeal to the imagination of a little girl, and she decided
to do what she could to assist the work of the Red Cross. Accord-
ingly, she asked the collector to put her name on the list of sub-
scribers, and every month handed over her contribution with
delight. It was only a small amount gathered by her own effort,


and by sacrifice and small self-denials. Shortly before Christmas
this little contributor received a small monetary present, with the
strict injunction that she was to spend it “on herself.” This she
resolutely refused to do, and insisted on the amount being- added
to her ordinary Red Cross gift. By the death of the little girl,
under sad circumstances at the seaside recently, the Castlemaine
Red Cross lost a faithful friend, but she has left an inspiring-
example to old and young.

and affiliated with the Victorian Division of the Red Cross Society.

contributions, both of goods and money, by the members. Good
responses were made to the special appeals for the French Red
Cross and the Y.M.C.A., and in 1917 the donations received
amounted to nearly /TOO. including ,£lO for the Prisoners of War

JINDIVICK.
In June, 1916, the Jindivick Patriotic League formed a branch
of the Victorian Red Cross, under the leadership of Mr. Callaghan
as President, with Mrs. Fryer, Secretary, and Mr. Dowling Treas-
urer. The people of the district were asked to subscribe weekly,
and at the end of each month the funds thus raised were for-
warded to Headquarters. The branch was able to respond to the
special British Red Cross appeal by a contribution of £6l. After
the response to the special appeal, the committee could see great
possibilities in the district. It was decided to ask the ladies to
take knitting and sewing into their homes, the branch providing
the material. One monthly balance-sheet showed gross total pro-
ceeds for the month of £25/14/6. From July, 1917, to January,
1918, over 400 articles were sent away. Jindivick is a small dairy-
ing district, of about 50 households, and as nearly every home has
a representative at the front (one has four), it has every reason to
be proud of itself.

KAARIMBA.
The members of the Kaarimba Branch of the Red Cross Society
hold a periodical grift day for the L.M.P.L., and on the last of
these, in September, 1917, it was decided to form a separate branch
of the L.M.P.L., to be called the Kaarimba Branch, the members
to work month about for the Red Cross and the Patriotic League.
There is a membership of 12, who pay the monthly fee of 6d. each.
A sports meeting held in September resulted in nett proceeds of
.£lO7/16/9, which amount was divided equally between the two
societies. Since then over 200 gifts have been despatched, and
13/- in cash for Xmas boxes.

hoped to continue the work till the war is ended.

LORNE.
The Lome Branch grew from a very small beginning. A few
enthusiastic workers formed themselves into a band shortly after
the war started, and having procured the use of a room and a few
machines, began making soldiers’ comforts of various kinds, all
of which were sent to the Central Depot. It was some months
before the workers became registered as a branch of the Victorian
Division of the Red Cross. The Lome Branch makes several
dozens of flannel undershirts each year. Another article of which
dozens of pairs are made by the branch is felt hospital slippers.
Besides the above special articles, knitted and crocheted comforts
of every description are turned out, some hundreds of socks being
sent away annually. Formerly the branch specialised in pyjamas
and warm dressing-gowns, jbut these articles have now been
allotted to other branches. Hundreds of small articles, such as
handkerchiefs, pillowslips, etc., have been and are still being sup-
plied by our branch. Great assistance is generously given Py
holiday visitors to the funds of the branch, which depends almost
entirely on such means to carry on the work throughout the year.


MARUNGI.
The branch consists of 18 members, who meet once a month.
The branch is financially maintained by each member paying 1/-
monthly, and an occasional Red Cross function, conducted by the
committee. At present the funds stand at £65/11/10. During the
last six months over £270 articles have been sent to Headquarters.

of articles which would, in one way or another, be of service to our
brave soldiers. During- the year ending- July 31st, 1917, our society
forwarded 136 articles and sundries. At present we are organis-
ing to raise a substantial sum which will enable us to increase
the scope of help to those to whom we owe so much.

NORTHCOTE.
A branch was fbrmed in Northcote shortly after the outbreak pf
war in 1914, with the Mayor, Councillor Tharrat, as the first Presi-
dent. Since then the position has been held by the following
Mayors, namely, Cr. B. Mason and Cr. Williams, who entered
whole-heartedly into the work before them. The response to our ap-
peals from the citizens of Northcote has been very gratifying.
Splendid help has been rendered by the Ladies’ Guilds of the Metho-
dist Church, the Baptist Church, the Church of England and the
Presbyterian Church. In addition to Red Cross, a considerable
amount of money has been raised for patriotic purposes, namely,
Lord Mayor’s Fund, £400: Belgian Relief, £615; Disabled Soldiers,
£340; Red Cross Fund, £331/19/11; Flower Day, £59/4/7; Austra-
lia Day, £81; Button Days, over £1,500. Two cots have been
endowed in the Caulfield Military Hospital, and -C6O donated to
the French Maternity Home. There is a men’s section, which has
a fully equipped workshop at the Town Hall. Work of all kinds
of wood, iron and leather has been despatched to the various mili-
tary hospitals at home and abroad. The following will give some
idea of the work done. Total number of articles made to date,
34,000 (value £6,000) : amount of money collected to date, approxi-
mately £6,540/12/-. Office-bearers.—The Mayor, Cr. Gray, Presi-

The Ouyen Branch started soon after the war began, and has
continued since. There are now 105 paying members. The amount
received for the last 12 months was from members, enter-
tainments, etc. The last three winters we have had a social every
week. The ladies provide the refreshments, and Messrs. Valen-
tine, Rees and Kennedy have provided the music for the three
winters. The work done each month on an average is over 40
articles. Each year we have sent 100 billies or boxes for the Christ-
mas in the trenches, apart from the general funds.

PHILLIP ISLAND.
In July, 1915, noting 1 the activities in other districts in connec
tion with war work, the idea occurred to several of the resident*
that, although only a small community, we might do something t(
help in the noble work. At the instigation of Mesdames Thomp
son and Wragge, a few of the ladies began meeting for Red Cros:
work, but it was not until September, 1915, that an actual brand
of the Red Cross was formed, when the above-mentioned ladie
were appointed to the offices of president and secretary respectively
Since then the work has been carried on with unflagging energ
by our 30 odd members. We are largely indebted to visitors, wh-
by concerts and entertainments given at holiday times add conj
siderably to the funds of our branch, and so assist our own local
efforts in the raising of money for the purchasing of materials-
The money donated and spent on materials for the year endinj
Julv. 1916, was £108/13/-, and for the year ending July, 191n
£106/3/ll£, and during that time 17 large cases of goods contain!
ing 4,104 articles were sent to Government House. *

PORTARLINGTON.
During: the year 1917 we have been able to contribute more
than in previous vears to the cost of flannel and wool supplied by
the Geelong; Centre. The result of the carnival in October was
very gratifying - , ,£136 being received and forwarded to Geelong as
Portarlington’s portion to the Geelong Gala Day appeal. The
British Red Cross Appeal realised £l6/9/-, which was forwarded to
the British Red Cross Treasurer, Melbourne. The sale of British
Red Cross buttons realised £3. The Belgian Envelope Christmas
Appeal realised £lO/7/9, and sales from Win-the-War buttons was
£3/17/-. Several thousands of articles have been made and col-
lected.

REDESDALE.
Since its inception, in February, to end of year 1917, the Red
Cross workers of Redesdale have collected about ,£123 by subscrip-
tions, race meetings, fairs, etc. This has enabled the ladies to
buy materials, out of which they have made 1,450 articles which
have been despatched to Government House. There are only about
seven or eight consistent workers, though on one or two occasions
the school children have helped. Redesdale is a very small town,
and the population is scattered, and there is also a Red Cross
Society at North Redesdale. Mrs. Peter McNiff was hon. secretary
until September, 1916, when she resigned owing to ill-health.

REST HOME No. 1, NOLAN ST., SOUTH MELBOURNE.
Committee—The V.A.D. Committee; Hon. Treasurer, Mr. H.
Courtney Dix; Officer-in-charge, Lieut.-Col. Pleasents, V.D.;
Matron, Mrs. G. T. Milne, R.V.T.N.A.; Hon. Medical Officer,
Capt. J. F. Agnew ; Hon. Secretary, Miss H. A. Elder; Assistant
Hon. Secretary, Miss L. Young; Resident Red Cross Sisters,
Mrs. C. M. Cooper, Miss R. M. Surman, Miss H. K. Panter and
Miss R. L. Wharton.
During the year 4,165 returned invalid soldiers were accom-
modated, including 3,172 in transit to other military districts. Of
the above total, 1,942 remained for less than one day. The aver-
age length of stay of the remainder was about three weeks. The
total number accommodated since the Home was opened is 6,523.
To meet the case of recently discharged soldiers not yet fit for
employment, and for whom no other provision exists, pending ttie
inception of the work of the Repatriation Board, permission was
obtained from the Red Cross Society and the Defence Department
to admit a limited number of discharged soldiers. This has in-
creased the usefulness of the Rest Home, and during the year
situations have been found for 193 of these men, with the aid of
the State War 'Council and other agencies. In nearly all cases
their services have given satisfaction. The work of the Home has
been carried on, as formerly, by a voluntary staff comprising a
matron and 230 voluntary aids, with a small paid staff consisting
of a chef, a mechanic, four or five orderlies, and two charwomen.
A chauffeur was employed also, but the Home has now dispensed
with the use of its motor cars, the requisite transport being pro-
vided gratuitously. The steam laundry, employing 46 voluntary
aids, has washed 94,328 articles, viz., 82,229 for the Rest Home,
5,496 for Highton Rest Home, and 6,603 for the Red Cross Depot,
as well as some articles for the French Red Cross Society. The
work of the Voluntary Aids has been punctually and thoroughly
performed in every department of the Rest Home, and every emer-
gency has been met without difficulty. In rendering this national
service many of these young women incur considerable travelling
expenses; some have given up salaried positions, and all have
shown their willingness to forego leisure and amusement in order
to work laboriously for the Red Cross Society and the sick and
wounded soldiers to whom it ministers. Household stores and
equipment have been received from the Red Cross Depot, apart
from gifts of underclothing, tobacco and cigarettes. The greatly
increased number of men in transit to other military districts has
severely taxedj the dining-room accommodation, dinner having
been served on occasions to 500 men in three relays. Alterations
are in progress, increasing the accommodation from 168 to 228
places. A covered way across the quadrangle is also being con-
structed.
Note.—Since date of these reports, Lieut.-Col. Bryant has re-
signed the Red Cross directorship owing to ill-health, and Lieut.-
Col. Geo. Horne, V.D., has been appointed Red Cross Director.
Mr. J. Harold Lord, Hon. Sec. of the S.J.A. Brigade Overseas,


Victorian Division, and Mr. H. Osgood Cameron, Superintendent
of the Victorial Civil Ambulance Service, are now Assistant Red
Cross Directors for Victoria. Dr. Agnew has left on active service.
Dr. Maxwell and Dr. Crawford Marshall are rendering honorary
services to the Rest Home.

meetings have been held fortnightly. Over 3,000 articles, includ-
ing shirts, pairs of socks, etc., also a quantity of home-made jam,
eggs and fruit, have been sent to the Central Depot. A men's
section, which was started in June, 1916, forwarded several well-
made articles, including footrests, bed screens, breadboards, foot-
stools, chairs, etc., to Government House. As the result of a specia':
effort, over was sent to the Y.M.C.A. ;£19 was raised for the
R.R.C.S. appeal. The French Red Cross and Prisoners of War

At present we have a roll of about 200 members, all of whom are
assisting the cause in various ways. Much of our revenue is the
result of systematic giving. We make regular monthly house-to-
house collections. Our total receipts to date amount to ,£1,084. We
have purchased rzrw materials at a cost of 0504. From these
materials about 4,TOO garments and hospital requisites have been
made up and despatched to the Central Depot. We have also re-
mitted to the Central Depot various sums aggregating .£145, and


we have endowed three cots at Caulfield Military Hospital, By
means of local and district special efforts, we have assisted various
patriotic funds as follows:—Prisoners of War Fund, .£90; Christ -
Xmas Boxes, £44; Button Fund, £36/5/8; Y.M.C.A., £33/10,6;
Belgian Babies’ Christmas Treat, £29/0/2; French Red Cross,
£22/10/-; British Red Cross, £18/9/-. As Red Cross .wprkers we
welcome the advent of the “Record,” and we trust it will stimu-
late the w'ork and encourage our Australian women to emulate the
example set by those of our brave and devoted Allies.

RED CROSS V.A.D. COMMITTEE, VICTORIA.
Committee.—Dr. Charles Bage (Chairman), Mrs. McKinley,
Dr. Edith Barrett, Lady Miller, Lady Creswell, Lieut.-Col. Jones,
Mrs. David Grant, Miss A. Anderson, Mr. W. F. Greenwood, Mr.
A. H. Hansford. Hon. Treasurer, Mr. H. Courtney Dix; Red
Cross Director for Voluntary Aid Detachments in Victoria, Lieut. -
Col. H. W. Bryant, V.D. ; Assistant Red Cross Director, Mr.
George M. Buchanan; Hon. Secretary, Miss A. M. Watt.
Opportunities are being given for detachments to take up avail-
able work in succession, though it is found necessary, in the case
of Red Cross workers actively engaged in the Depot or elsewhere,
and who are on the V. A.D. Register, to relieve them of some of
their duties in connection with their military areas. A badge has
been adopted. Red Cross Rest Home No. 1 employs 230 Voluntary
Aids. Contingents of' V.A.D. women and St. J.A. Brigade men
have accompanied returned invalid soldiers on train trips during
the year as follows:—18 Adelaide trips, on which 29 St. J.A.B.
men and 36 V.A.D. women accompanied 1,016 invalid soldiers,


and 7 Sydney trips, on which 30 St. J.A.B. men and 30 V.A.D.
women accompanied 1,724 invalid soldiers. At Bacchus Marsli,
Ballarat, Beaufort, Ararat, Stawell, Horsham and Murray Bridge,
on the journey to Adelaide, and at Seymour, Benalla, Wangaratta,
Albury, Goulburn, and Moss Vale, on the journey to Sydney, the
trains are met by contingents of Red Cross Voluntary Aids who
supply refreshments to the soldiers, often at a late hour of the
night. The committee records with appreciation the valuable co-
operation of the St. Tohn’s Ambulance Brigade and the Victorian
Civil Ambulance Service in this and other useful work done for
returned soldiers, and desires to thank the Red Cross workers of
Adelaide and Sydney for hospitality extended to the Victorian train
contingents. Voluntary Aids were supplied for office work in con-
nection with the Victorian Appeal for the British Red Cross Society.
Drafts are made from the various detachments in succession to
serve tea and refreshments daily to invalid soldiers at the Red
Cross Tea Rooms, Victoria Barracks. This work has been under
taken at the request of the military authorities. The V.A.D. Regis-
ter in its present state contains 1,791 enrolments.

WITH THE RED GROSS IN EGYPT.
When I was a small boy I read in the story of the Exodus of the
children of Israel from Egypt that the Israelites borrowed many
valuable things from the Egyptians, never intending to return them.
This made me sympathetic to the Egyptians. I felt they were treated
deceitfully and robbed shamefully. I have got over that feeling,
for if the British people are the descendants of the lost ten tribes,
then the modern Egyptians have got all the value ctf those ancient
baubles back again with compound interest, through their spoiling
of the boys of the armies of occupation, 1914 to 1916 A.D. The
bill for the interest had been mnning from 1500 B.C., but they got
it all right, and compensation for illegal detention of the jewellery.
The Australians had plenty of money, and the native storekeepers
secured it. From being on the verge of a financial crisis, Egypt
became a land flowing with money. When the sick and wounded
Australians had spent all they had on tinned fruit, tinned meats,
tinned fish, biscuits and other things, sold at famine prices by the
wily traders, then the sisters and nurses came to the rescue and
spent all they had on the boys. How they hung_ together, these
Anzac boys and girls ! Esprit de corps wasn’t in it, and we want-
ed an Australian word to describe it; it was DINKUM. The Red
Cross had, thanks to generous Australia, plenty of-these things in
store, but the people in the hospitals did not know it, and it was
my first business to take the little yellow Fafnir car, so generously
donated by Mr. C. W. Chapman for Red Cross work in Egypt, and
visit the No. 1 A.G.H, at Heliopolis,, with its auxiliaries at Luna


Park and the Atelier, and No. 2 A.G.H. at Gezireh Palace, and
various infectious disease hospitals and convalescent camps, and
let the matrons, sisters, nurses, voluntary aids and all the brave
members of the splendid women’s battalions know that the Red
Cross did not only provide bandages and dressings, pyjamas and
bed socks, but tinned tripe and rabbit, sausages, apples, pears,
quinces, pineapples, ham paste, coffee and milk, cocoa and milk,
biscuits, jellies, arrowroot, sago, tanioca, plum puddings, eau de
Collingwood and insect powder. With such a list to offer, .1 felt
like Mr. Randal Alcock, Mr. Howard Berry and the whole Chamber
of Commerce rolled into one, which accounts for the fact, and I
have not accounted for it before, so it is yours exclusively, the
liberal appearance of
