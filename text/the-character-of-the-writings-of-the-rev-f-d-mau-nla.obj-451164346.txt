PREFACE.
The peculiar form of this publication seems
to require an explanation of the reasons which
have led me to adopt it. I will therefore briefly
state them.
Mr. Maurice’s books have attracted the
attention and admiration of a large number both
of the clergy and laity of the Church. Nor is
this to be wondered at; for they possess many
attractive qualities. They are written in simple,
forcible language; they contain many just and
striking observations ; they breathe a generous
and candid spirit; they seem to have been
dictated by a sincere and deep conviction of the
truth and practical importance of what they are
designed to teach ; they appeal strongly to the
human sympathies of the reader; they virtually
claim to explain, in a manner which has
never been done before, the true import of the


PREFACE.
The peculiar form of this publication seems
to require an explanation of the reasons which
have led me to adopt it. I will therefore briefly
state them.
Mr. Maurice’s books have attracted the
attention and admiration of a large number both
of the clergy and laity of the Church. Nor is
this to be wondered at; for they possess many
attractive qualities. They are written in simple,
forcible language; they contain many just and
striking observations ; they breathe a generous
and candid spirit; they seem to have been
dictated by a sincere and deep conviction of the
truth and practical importance of what they are
designed to teach ; they appeal strongly to the
human sympathies of the reader; they virtually
claim to explain, in a manner which has
never been done before, the true import of the


Bible ; and lastly, and above all, they pretend
to solve the mystery of God’s dealings with man,
and to remove those “ difficulties of belief,” which
perplex and torment so many thoughtful minds.
But, while they have thus found many enthu-
siastic admirers, they appear to others, and to
myself among the number, to teach doctrine
directly opposed to that of the Bible, and
subversive of the fundamental principles of the
Gospel. They are therefore, in my opinion and
the opinion of those who think with me, exceed-
ingly dangerous; and we feel it to be of the
highest importance, that the Church, and espe-
cially the Clergy, should be warned against their
seductive and pernicious influence. But how is
this to be done ? The most natural course would
seem to be to point out, and refute, the errors
which they contain. It is however exceedingly
difficult, if not impossible, to deduce from Mr.
Maurice’s writings his opinions on any theological
subject; so as to be able to state them with the
precision necessary for their refutation, and not
at the same time to incur from him and his
friends the charge of misrepresentation. One
eminent divine, Dr. Candlish, who certainly
would not wilfully misrepresent, and, it might
have been supposed, would not be likely to
misunderstand the contents of a volume which

But, while they have thus found many enthu-
siastic admirers, they appear to others, and to
myself among the number, to teach doctrine
directly opposed to that of the Bible, and

Gospel. They are therefore, in my opinion and

Maurice’s writings his opinions on any theological

precision necessary for their refutation, and not
at the same time to incur from him and his
friends the charge of misrepresentation. One
eminent divine, Dr. Candlish, who certainly
would not wilfully misrepresent, and, it might
have been supposed, would not be likely to
misunderstand the contents of a volume which


he had undertaken publicly to criticise, has been
complained of by Mr. Maurice on this ground.
Another able writer, Mr. Bigg, after remarking
“ that Dr. Candlish had not attained to a funda-
mental comprehension of the drift of Mr. Maurice,
and was consequently very often at fault as to his
real meaning,” relates how he himself discovered
the clue, which guided him through the labyrinth
of Mr. Maurice’s speculations. Patient and
repeated readings of Mr. Maurice’s principal
works, aided by conversations with a near kins-
man and friend, enabled him, he tells us, after a
time, to attain to a distinct and assured compre-
hension of the peculiar philosophical mysticism
on which Mr. Maurice’s theology was founded;
and which, though no where distinctly explained
by Mr. Maurice, he perceived to be always
assumed and implied. Mr. Maurice would
probably deny “ the Neological Platonic Ra-
tionalism,’’ which this author ascribes to him,
as emphatically as he has denied the heretical
opinions, of which he is accused by Dr. Candlish.
But supposing Mr. Bigg to have really dis-
covered, as he thinks he has, the “ master-
key ” which fits “ all the locks,” a discovery,
which it required so great labour to make, is not
likely to be generally available, either for con-
vincing Mr. Maurice’s disciples of their master’s

which it required so great labour to make, is not

errors, or for preventing earnest young men from
joining his school.
Some other means seems therefore to be
required for breaking the charm, by which Mr.
Maurice holds so many minds in subjection;
and it has occurred to me, that none is so likely
to be effectual as a careful and minute examin-
ation of some particular portion of his works;
conducted with the view, not of refuting the
theological opinions of the author, but of point-
ing out the inconclusiveness and sophistry of
his reasoning. Judging from the parts which
I have read of his various works, and which
may, I think, be regarded as a sample of
the whole, my conviction is, that such an
examination will show them to abound in
unwarranted assertions, inconsequential rea-
soning, and erroneous conclusions. I believe that
it will disclose in them inconsistent assump-
tions ; new and unauthorised significations of
words ; summaries of results, which never have
been arrived at; confused ideas ; emphatic
language, which conveys no distinct meaning ;
references to statements assumed to have been
made, and conclusions to have been arrived at,
for which the reader looks back in vain; and
last and worst of all, strange and unaccountable
misinterpretations of the Word of God. These

are, I am aware, serious charges, and such
as I may justly be required to prove. I
acknowledge the obligation; and accordingly
I now submit to the judgment of the public
the following strictures, which are the result
of the kind of examination to which I
have alluded, applied to the first sermon in Mr.
Maurice’s volume upon Sacrifice. I have selected
this sermon merely because I happened to be
reading it a few days ago, and becafise it affords
a fair specimen of his style, and mode of reason-
ing. For the purpose of my argument I would as
readily take a sermon upon the Gospel of St.
John, or an essay, or any other portion of his
works.
In the strictures which I have passed upon
his writings, I would beg not to be understood
as accusing Mr. Maurice of any intentional
sophistry or disingenuousness. I believe him to
be a sincere and earnest, and withal a truly
benevolent man; but one who has never humbled
himself as a little child to receive the teaching
of God in the Scriptures. He appears to have
thought by his own vain reasoning to penetrate
the counsels of Him, concerning whom the
Apostle has truly said, that His judgments are
unsearchable, and His tcays past finding out; and

plified Milton’s description in the lines quoted
by him in this sermon ;
“ Others apart, sat on a hill retired,
In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate ;
Fixed Fate, Free Will, Foreknowledge absolute,
And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.”
It may be that, instead of discussing such
questions with others, he has pondered them in
his own mind; but the result is the same: He
has found no end in wandering mazes lost. He
cannot think, or write, upon the things of God
with clearness or precision ; because his mind
is always obscured by the clouds of his own misty
imagination. When he treats of other subjects,—
as in those parts of his prefaces, where he is
vindicating himself from the attacks which have
been made upon him; and in passages of his
works, where his metaphysics have no place, —
no writer can surpass him in perspicuity.
One word respecting his disciples. It may
be asked, “ How, if his writings be so full as
you allege them to be of sophistry and false
reasoning, can so many intelligent persons read
them with pleasure and admiration?” Audit
may be added ; “Is it not presumptuous in you,
when you acknowledge that they are so greatly
admired, to make such allegations against
them ? ” To the first of these questions I reply,

may be added ; “Is it not presumptuous in you,

that I can only explain the fact of so many
intelligent persons admiring Mr. Maurice’s
writings by the hypothesis, that however intelli-
gent they may be, they do not use that mental
exertion which is necessary for tracing his
hidden trains of thought, and for detecting his
sophistries. They are content with a superficial
notion of the drift of his books, and do not
take the pains to obtain a clear perception of
the author’s meaning in each particular sentence
and expresssion. Being pleased with the general
sentiment and style, they allow themselves to he
carried away by his graphic descriptions and
plausible reasoning, without stopping to test the
accuracy of his statements, or the soundness of
his arguments. To the second question I answer,
that whether I have been presumptuous in making
such allegations must he determined by the result
of my attempt to prove them. By that result
I am willing to be judged. All that I ask is
an attentive perusal, and an impartial decision.
I have printed Mr. Maurice’s sermon continu-
ously upon the left hand pages, so that it can be
conveniently read through by itself without the
train of thought being in any way interrupted.
This, I would suggest, should be first done, as
being only fair to him. I would then ask that

It is not, therefore, an idle form which preachers
use —if it is, it must be a blasphemous form —
when they ask that the Spirit of God may quicken
and raise the hearts which the word of God is
sent to illuminate. To imagine that any book
or any living foice can give, if there is not a
receiver, or that it can give, except according to
the measure of the receiver, is to contradict all
experience and all reason.
H 2. The passage I have read to you is the first
in the Bible which refers to a sacrifice. It has
stirred up a number of doubts in the minds of
men. I will refer to a few of them, and I will
say how far I think this story will resolve them,
how far it obliges us to seek for further light,
which it does not impart, and which it ought not
to impart.

lessly by mixing together) texts on the subject of
Sacrifice, which are taken from various hooks of the
Bible, we shall not confuse but enlighten our
minds. Secondly : the statement that we often
end with holding the notions, &c., surely needs to
be explained by some specific illustrations, in
order that we may know what to understand by
it, and what degree of truth there is in it.
Thirdly ; it is well that the writer tells us what
he means by speaking in us ; viz., awakening us
to thought, &c., for the words properly express no
such idea. If it did not sound offensive, I should
call the expression a cant phrase. Lastly : the
statement, It is not an idle form, &c., is certainly
true. But why therefore 1 How is this a con-
sequence of the preceding statement ? Other
words may awaken us to thought, &c., without the
influence of the Spirit of God. Why then may
not the Word of G o od ?
IF 2. The word sacrifice does not properly
include, as the writer throughout this sermon
assumes it to do, all offerings to God ; and
although in our English version of Hebrews xi.
4, it seems to be applied to Cain’s offering ; yet
this, as Archbishop Magee has shown in his note
upon the passage, is not the case in the original
Greek. In Hebrews v. 1, and viii. 3, gifts, among
which Cain’s offering is to be included, are
expressly distinguished from sacrifices.

Cain and Abel know about sacrifice ? Were they

something, and what they were to offer ? or had
that revelation been made to Adam, and did they

which are really quite distinct from one another,
and thereby does very much confuse the minds of

different thing to ask, What do we know about
it; and whence has our knowledge of it been
obtained ?
Instead of the questions, Gan we have that
knowledge ? Is it not all a dream ? The writer
might as well have suggested; Is all Scripture
given by inspiration of God ? Are we not follow-

history of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine
of the Apostles concerning it ?

given by inspiration of God ? Are we not follow-

history of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine
of the Apostles concerning it ?

very just.


set forth in intelligible terms. The book of
Genesis has already recognised that principle.
The command not to eat of the fruit of the tree
in the midst of the garden, is strict and definite.
It is proclaimed as the precept -which the parents
of the race were to recollect and follow ; the one
which they could not disobey without bringing
death upon themselves. If another precept of
wider range and greater permanence, as definite
and positive, was made either then or speedily
afterwards, would the historian have left those
whom he wrote to instruct, to guess or divine it ?

with the style of his narrative, to assume that a
revelation of God had preceded any acts of theirs,
and was the cause of them ? I am most anxious
to lead you to notice this distinction ; it is so
important for the understanding of this subject,
and of the whole of the doctrine of Scripture. I
think you will find that throughout the Scrip-
tures, an announcement about this or that act
which it behoves a man to do or to leave undone,
is called a statute or an ordinance. It is said to
proceed from the Lord ; He makes it, He
enforces it. But a revelation is a discovery of
Himself to a creature whom He has formed to
know Him. Such revelations, when they mark

altogether sophistical. In IF 3 the writer pro-
poses as the first question for consideration ;
What did Cain and Abel 'know about sacrifice ?
Were they told by a special revelation that they were
to offer something, and what they were to offer ? or
had that revelation been made to Adam, and did they
receive the knoivledge by transmission ? In answer,

existence ofi a decree upon the subject, he suggests

in the bush did, may be recorded with especial
solemnity; but they are implied in every part of
the narrative. It is constructed upon the
assumption that they occur continually. The
postulate of the Bible is, that man could not be
what he is, if God did not hold converse with
him ; that this is his distinction from other
creatures ; that this is the root of all that he
knows, the ground of what is right and reason-
able in him. You cannot read the Bible
narratives simply without perceiving that this is
the maxim from which they start; people who
will not acknowledge it as a true maxim, talk of
the language they find in the sacred writings as
characteristic of a Semitic people, or of the
infancy of civilization ; but they cannot help
perceiving that it is there, and that the essence,
as well as the outward form, of the history
depends upon it.

paragraph, he prepares the way for the new and
unauthorised signification, which he puts upon it
in the 7th paragraph. Thus the attentive reader
is perplexed, and the incautious one deceived.
The definition of a revelation, that it is a
discovery {by God) of Himself to a creature He has
formed to know Him, is incorrect, because not
sufficiently comprehensive. The revelation of
Nebuchadnezzar’s dream to Daniel by God was
certainly not a discovery of Himself ; nor can a
large portion of the revelations to the Prophets,
recorded in the Old Testament Bdriptures, be so
described.
Although it is clear from the Bible narratives,
that God did frequently, in the early age of the
world, hold converse ivith man ; yet it certainly
cannot be inferred, that He holds converse with all
men, in all ages of the world, in the same manner
that He formerly did with the Patriarchs. This,
which the writers language implies to be the
postulate of the Bible , will, I think, when plainly
stated, be rejected by all as manifestly untrue.
IT 6. This much more deep, &c. These words
convey a fallacious idea. A revelation is not a
more deep and aivful kind of communication than
a direct ordinance, for a direct ordinance may
be the subject-matter of a revelation ; as, for
example, all the ordinances of the Mosaic law.

since. They look now and then to the sky over
their heads ; generally they are busy with the
stubborn earth, which they are weeding of its
thorns and thistles, or with the animals they are
watching and folding, and following when they
wander. To such men there come thoughts of
One who is ruling them as they rule the sheep,
who in some strange way makes the seeds grow
which they put in the ground. These thoughts
are altogether wonderful ; they cannot weigh
them nor measure them ; at times they are
crushed by them ; at times they are lifted up by
them. No doubt their parents have told them
that they have a Lord, and that He sees them,
and that He is ordering their ways. Surely it is
He who is making them feel His presence, urging
them to confess Him. How shall they confess
Him ? What is the simplest of all possible
methods, in which they can manifest their sub-
jection ? Ask yourselves : Is it speech ?Is it
some vehement phrase of thanksgiving, some
passionate .petition ? These may come in time,
but they cannot come first; they are not the most
childlike way of testifying homage, not the one
which ordinary human experience would lead us
to look for, when One has revealed Himself to us
whom we perceive but dimly, yet with whom we
feel we have to do. Acts go before words. The


Abel concerning sacrifice, not any extraordinary
communication made to them by God, but only
those thoughts of God, which come to all men in
the course of their daily labours; and by which
God makes them to feel His presence, and urges
them to confess Him. If this notion of a revelation
be followed out to its legitimate results, we must
understand the words, The Lord said unto Cain,
to mean no more than that the Lord suggested
certain thoughts to Cain’s mind. In like manner
we must explain all the communications, which
the Bible records to have been made by God to
the Old Testament Saints. Is this to have
sufficient reverence for the hook to follow in the steps
which it r marks out for us ? When the writer’s
meaning is thus distinctly stated; will the reader
acquiesce [in his idea of a revelation ? Will he
himself avow and defend it ?
Again ; is it true that a man, whose mind was
occupied with these thoughts of God, would
in the first instance testifij his homage in the
manner here represented ? Would he be likely
to testify it so at all, unless he were instructed
by God in some more distinct manner than by
thoughts which he could not weigh nor measure; by
which at times he was crushed, at times lifted up 1
In particular, would a man, who, like Abel, was
not authorised to kill an animal even for food,
