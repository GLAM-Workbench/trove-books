POPULAE EEEOES CONCEENING
AUSTEALIA,
At the last meeting for the session of the Society of Arts, held on
Wednesday evening, the Hon. Gavan Duffy read a paper on
? Popular Errors concerning Australia."
The chair was occupied by Mr. Ayrton, M.P, The room was
densely crowded, and among those present were :?Sir John Gray,
M.P., Sir Francis Crossley, M.P., Sir Patrick O?Brien, M.P., Mr.
Sergeant Armstrong, M.P., Mr. Charles Gilpin, M.P., Colonel
Kennedy, Mr. Dillon, M.P., Mr. Marsh., M.P, Mr. M?Kenna, M.P.,
Mr. Tristram Kennedy, M.P., the Hon. Captain Harte, Mr.
Henderson, M.P., Captain Gridley, M.P., Mr. Pollard Urquhart,
M.P., Mr. Russell, M.P., Mr. Brady, M.P., Mr. Richard Swift, Mr,
M?Mahon, Mr. Serjeant O?Brien, Mr. Cashel Hoey, Mr. James Tevan,
Mr. Tidd Pratt, Mr. Leslie Foster, Mr. Edward Wilson, Mr. Fitz-
gerald, Mr. K. E. Brodribb, Mr. Hughes, Mr. Melson, Mr. Sydney,
Mr. Counsel, Mr. Adams, &c.
Mr. Duffy, who was warmly received on rising, then said ;
I propose to speak to-night of a country which is greatly
misunderstood in England, and which England, I fear, is causing to
be misunderstood by the rest of the world. I know of no two
communities which bear so strange and anomalous a relation to each
other as the relation existing at present between the Australian
continent and the British islands. The conditions which ought to


ensure mutual goodwill are unusually abundant. The population of
that continent is not only from the same stock as your own, but
consists in a large degree of men and women who within a few years
were your fellow-citizens and neighbours. Its institutions are not
only of the same general family, but are strictly identical with yours,
wherever identity was not impossible. Its social customs and its
intellectual enjoyments are the fondly-cherished habits of ? home.?
Its material interests are so closely intermingled with yours that
many kingdoms of Europe where ambassadors are maintained, and
special correspondents despatched to foster friendly relations, add
less than it does to the annual accumulation of wealth and expansion
of commerce in England. Within a dozen years more than four
hundred thousand persons have left these islands to establish them-
selves there ; and no four hundred thousand, taken at random from
those who remained, have been so profitable customers to the merchants,
manufacturers, and artizans of the common home, or contributed
so much to its prosperity. And it would be a great mistake to
suppose that these emigrants consisted merely of the rank and file of
an ? army of industry.? It is a rare thing now to meet with a
single family of the middle classes which has not sent at least one
recruit to Australia. When the lands were thrown open to pastoral
occupation, and again at the period of the gold discovery, a multi-
tude of younger sons of the gentry and professional classes flocked
to it, as their ancestors had followed Raleigh to the then newest
world ; and many of the names which have been dearest to these
islands in our own day are borne in Australia by descendants, or
close collateral relatives of the men who made them famous. To
take a few notable instances ?there have been within the last ten
years, and in most of the cases there are still, among the Australian
population members of the families of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Arnold
(of Rugby), Brougham, O?Connell, Jenner, Farady, Babbage,
Whewell, Stephen; or, to come still closer to present tastes and
sympathies, Dickens, Gladstone, Kingsley, William Carleton,
Macready, Helps; or, to take the immense community which is
sometimes called the religious world, sons of Edward Irving and
Baptist Noel, and a brother of Frederick Lucas, hold public appoint-
ments in Melbourne; and every city on the continent could produce
a list of the same character. Yet, with all these common sympathies
and interests, there are few countries in the world of which the people
of England have received impression's so erroneous and untrustworthy
as of the Australian colonies. The colonists recount with bitter
pleasantry stories of grotesque mistakes, not merely of Australian
politics, but of the cardinal facts of Australian geography, made from
time to time by conspicuous writers and speakers in England; but
they make cheerful allowance for imperfect information upon facts
lying so far from the business of daily life, where the ignorance is
not associated with arrogance or malice.


They are persuaded, however, and upon no light grounds, I think,
that the rivals and enemies of England are treated with less harsh-
ness of judgment tlian is habitually exhibited towards them by many
public writers in this country. Whatever is good is ignored or
grudgingly admitted; whatever is not good is distorted and exagge-
rated out of all resemblance to the truth. Instead of regarding this
great social expedition of our people to new regions with some of
the interest and sympathy never denied to military expeditions?
instead of recognising their remarkable labours in the cities
which they have founded, the wealth which they have added
to the storehouse of human comfort and prosperity, and the
states which they have created and governed (conquests to be
proud of) ?they are habitually represented as little better than the
semi-barbarous and chaotic republics of South America. When one
comes to inquire wdiat is the root of this prejudice it will be found,
I think, generally to spring from a belief that the Australians,
having a great trust committed to them in the complete power of
self-government, have abused it, and run riot in licentious excesses.
It is amazing how wide-spread and deep-rooted this belief has
become, considering the slender foundation upon which it rests. In
what respect has government failed in Australia ? Those who have
had the duty of governing these communities for the last ten years
consider that they were engaged in a deeply-interesting and pregnant
experiment, which has been conducted on the whole in a manner to
deserve the applause ?and not the censure?of thoughtful men. A
community composed of the middle and lower classes attempted
practically, for the first time, to work the complicated machinery of
the British Constitution, not only without the counterpoise supplied
at home by the personal influence of the sovereign, and of hereditary
rank and wealth, but in connection with a franchise which, from the
circumstances of the country, was necessarily nearly as wide as the
adult male population; and yet to preserve completely intact the
principles and the machinery of responsible government ?the most
marvellous system for accomplishing peaceably the wishes of a free
people that mankind has framed.
Under these conditions colonial statesmen have undeniably pre-
served public order, maintained public credit, and fostered national
prosperity. They have so well preserved it that a man?s life, liberty,
and property are as effectually under the protection of law in
the city of Melbourne as in the city of London; and marvellous as
the prosperity of England has been for the last ten years, it is less
prosperous than Australia. In what respect, then, has government
failed 1 Public men have committed mistakes, of course, for mis-
takes are committed in all experiments; but these are the results
which have been attained.
Whenever I have pressed any person prejudiced against Australia
with this question, I jjayp invariably found that political instability


was what alarmed him; that he considered a ministerial crisis was
the normal condition of Australia, and that we set up Governments,
like nine-pins, only for the pleasure of knocking them down again.
I recently heard a man of distinguished ability, in one of the most
memorable speeches delivered in the present House of Commons,
declare that in Australia the stability of society, industry, property,
and the well-being of the community were endangered by constant
changes of ministry, and that it would be necessary for their own
safety to deprive the colonists of responsible government, and create
a stable executive instead. lam well aware that party politics are
forbidden here, and I have not the slightest disposition to obtrude
them; but the government of colonies is a question of political science,
and the primary condition of governing any community is to under-
stand its actual condition. I would invite you, therefore, to look at
Australia historically, putting the distance of place in lieu of distance
of time, and test by one or two instances how far this sort of popular
belief is well founded. It is true in point of fact, that the
Australian colonies have been signalised by constant, or even by
unusually-frequent, changes of government 1 I know the belief is
all but universal in England; but I doubt if many of those who
accept it have taken the trouble to inquire whether it is perfectly
well founded. I copied, recently, from a number of the late
National Review a statement of this character even stronger than
Mr, Lowe?s, and, as it was apparently made without any political
object, I prefer to select it for analysis. In an article upon the
American war (in the tw 7 enty-sixth number of the Review ), the writer
incidentally describes the experiment of establishing parliamentary
government in Australia, and, without taking any trouble to argue
the question, delivers judgment as upon a point where the public
mind was already made up :
It is, however (he says), only fair to observe that the American Consti-
tution has one great excellence at this moment, not indeed as compared with
the English Constitution, but as compared with that degraded imitation of
it which exists, for example, in our Australian colonies. In those Govern-
ments the Parliament is wholly unfit to choose an Executive; ? it has not
patriotism enough to give a decent stability to the Government; there are
* ministerial crises ? once a week, and actual changes of administration once a
month.? The suffrage has been lowered to such a point among the refuse
population of the gold colonies, that representative government is there a
very dubious blessing, if not a certain and absolute curse.
Here are not only general and sweeping imputations, but fortu-
nately exact and specific statements. If an Australian, familiar
with the facts, were to reply that the Governments so savagely dis-
paraged had work to do in founding and organising new states as
serious as fell to the lot of any administration in Europe during the
same period, and did that work in general effectually, and to the
satisfaction of the people who confided power to them j and further,


that to mistake for confusion and chaos the vigorous action of new
communities, which appear regular and well ordered to eyes familiar
with the forces at work, was like the dogmatism of the deaf spectator
of a waltz, who insisted that the performers were lunatics because he
could not hear the music which gave meaning and harmony to their
movements; moreover that this sort of thing, and worse than this,
had been written in England of the first memorable Congress of the
United Colonies of North America, with no benefit to any one con-
cerned, but much evil j if, I say, an Australian made this sort of
defence, though strictly true, it would, perhaps, amount to little.
But in the language of the courts, I not only demur to the
indictment, but join issue on the facts. I deny that these charges
are true ; and I propose to put them to the test. lam not going to
inquire whether there are ? ministerial crises? once a week, and
actual changes of administration once a month, but whether, when
the truth is known, there is any just ground for wonder or complaint
on this score.
The territory of Australia is nearly as large as civilised Europe?
that is, Europe shorn of the frozen swamps and penal settlements of
northern Russia. This territory is divided into five states possessing
parliamentary government, which are politically as independent of
each other, and geographically as separate, as the governments of
England, France, Italy, Prussia, and Austria. The neighbouring
islands of New Zealand form a sixth state under parliamentary
government; and the political news from these islands commonly
reaching Europe under the heading of Melbourne or Sydney, the
chief ports of departure for European ships, is confounded by
ordinary readers with Australian news. It is easier to reach Paris
and even Turin from London than to pass from the capital of any
one of these states to the capital of its nearest neighbour. Berlin
or Vienna is much nearer to London than the capitals of the colonies
lying farthest apart are to each other. But whenever a change is
announced in any of those separate governments, half the journals
in England, and, it may be presumed, a proportionate number of
politicians in clubs and reading rooms, cry, ? What ! another minis-
terial crisis in Australia! will they never be quiet T? Perhaps they
will add, with the National Review , ? these people have a crises once
a week, and a change of ministers once a month.? These criticisms
in good time are carried across the ocean, and the colonists feel
natural wrath and shame that cultivated men among their own
kinsmen persist in making blunders about Australia which a
shepherd in the Australian ? bush? would scarcely make with respect
to European states.
This is the primary source of the common error on this subject.
But it may naturally be asked, whether, after making due allowance
on this score, there is not still an inordinate number of ministerial
changes in these new States. Let us see whether there is or not.


One of the States (Queensland) has only existed since December,
1859, but during that entire period of six years and a half there has
been no change of ministry. Two or three individual members have
left the Government upon personal grounds, and been replaced by
others of the same opinions, but there has been no political or party
change whatever. Another of the States (Tasmania) has been under
parliamentary government since 1855, but during these eleven years
there have been only six administrations. Six administrations in
eleven years I may be told are a great deal too many. I can only
reply that England is the mother and model of representative
governments, the colonies have no pretensions to be better than she
is in this respect, and in England during the same eleven years there
have been exactly six administrations. New South Wales, the
senior State as a distinct colony, and as the seat of parliamentary
institutions, has enjoyed responsible government for more than ten
years, and it has had till quite recently for its prime minister a
gentleman who, if prolonged tenure of office be a merit, may boast
of having held that position in his colony for as many of these years
as Lord Palmerston held it in England; with such occasional inter-
ruptions as even that fortunate statesman did not escape. And his
most important competitor has held office during these years twice as
long as Mr. Disraeli. But Victoria remains the most populous, the
most vivacious, and the most democratic of the Australian colonies,
and that one commonly cited by English critics as the example of all
Australian excesses. For her case it will be necessary to go a little
into detail. The constitution by which Victoria obtained the power
of changing its government was proclaimed law in the colony in
November, 1855. In the ten years and five months ensuing there
have been eight administrations. Mr. Haines?s administration
existed from the proclamation of the Constitution to March 11,
1857 ?upwards of a year and a quarter. Mr. O?Shanassy?s
administration, from 11th March, 1857, to 28th April, 1857 only
six weeks. Mr. Haines?s second administration, from April 29th,
1857, to March 10, 1858?a year, minus two weeks. Mr.
O?Shanassy?s second administration, from March 10, 1858, to
October 26, 1859 ?upwards of a year and a half. Mr. Nicholson?s
administration, from October 24, 1859, to November 29, 1860
upwards of a year. Mr. Heales?s administration, from November
29, 1860, to November 13, 1861 ?a year, minus a few days. Mr.
O?Shanassy?s third administration, from November 13, 1861, to
June 30, 1363 ?upwards of a year and a half. Mr. M?Culloch?s
administration, from June 30, 1863, to April, 1866 ?two years and
ten months; and it is still in power. Omitting the purely-
exceptional case of the first O?Shanassy administration, this gives an
average of a year and a half for each Government, or, including that
administration, we have an average of a year and a quarter ?not of
p, month ? as the National Review undertakes to affirm. And


undoubtedly one main cause why Governments have not been longer
lived is that public men sometimes resigned office too promptly?
more promptly, and on less sufficient grounds, than the English
practice justifies?because they were determined to keep high the
standard of parliamentary responsibility, I may remark, in passing,
that both the statesman and the reviewer to whom I have been
alluding attribute the sudden changes of government which they
charge on the Australians to the extension of the franchise. But
this is manifestly a mistake, for the only very short-lived administra-
tion occurred before the franchise was extended ; and in later years,
with an extensive franchise, each Government has been longer lived
than its predecessor. But a year and a quarter is a miserably-short
average duration for a ministry, it may be said, and argues, after all,
that the colonial parliament has, in the words of the reviewer, ?not
patriotism enough to give a decent stability to government.? The
colonial parliament has given precisely such a decent stability to
government as the English parliament has been in the habit of
giving when it was not mastered by a great popular favourite, or
managed by a skilful intriguer. The succession of long-lived
English administrations in the Georgian era, commanding undeviating
majorities in parliament, belonged to a period when parliamentary
corruption constituted one of the chief agencies of government. As
soon as the contest of opinion began to be fairly fought in the
House of Commons, ministries changed repeatedly, or endured only
when backed by great popular enthusiasm. The exceptional good
fortune of Pitt or Palmerston can scarcely be considered a fair
standard to apply to colonial ministers ; and the successful devices
of Walpole, or the Pelhams, for tranquilising parliament, are not a
desirable model to propose for colonial adoption. But, under the
ordinary laws of political action, English administrations, since
responsible government has existed, were about as long-lived as
colonial administrations. Instead of taking up the Annual Register
for specific dates, I will borrow illustrations from two or three
popular sources running through the last century. The famous
Public Advertiser, in July, 1766, a hundred years ago, contained a
letter bewailing the short life and sudden death of Governments in
England. This letter is now known to have been written by
Edmund Burke. Prior, in his memoirs of Burke, reprints it as his,
and it bears evident marks of his strong hand:?
Since the happy accession of His present Majesty, to this day (says the
letter) we have worn out no less than five complete sets of honest, able,
upright ministers, not to speak of the present, whom God long preserve.
First we had Mr. Pitt?s administration, next the Duke of Newcastle?s, then
Lord Bute?s, then Mr. Grenville?s, and lastly My Lord Rockingham?s. Now,
sir, if you will take a bit of chalk and reckon from the 7th of October, 1760,
to the 30th of July, 1766, you will find five years nine months and thirty
days, which, divided by five, the total of administrations, gives exactly one
year and sixty days each on an average, as we say in the city, and one day
more they have the good fortune to serve in leap year.


Five years later, Mr. Burke, in a speech in the House of Commons
on the City of London Remonstrance, speaking of the previous nine
years, returns to this subject.
During this period, sir, the direction of public affairs has been in no less
a number of hands than Mr, Pitt?s, Lord Bute?s, Mr. Grenville?s, the Mar-
quis of Rockingham?s, the Duke of Grafton?s, and Lord North?s, so that, if
we were to divide the nine years equally between them, there would be just
a year and a half for every separate administration.
This was the era of the giants?the great age of Fox and Pitt,
when, for public spirit and political ability, Parliament was at its
zenith. Yet, some rash and censorious critic in the colonies, if he
looked with the eye of the scorner at the mother country, might
discern no other moral in its eager contest for political principles
than that it had not ? patriotism enough to give a decent stability
to government.?
If we leap over the era of the Anti-Jacobins, when opinion was
suppressed, and come to the period of real parliamentary struggle
which immediately preceded and followed the passing of the Reform
Bill, we have the same state of things recurring. Mr. Albany Fon-
blanque many years ago re-issued a collection of his political writings
in the Examiner , under the title of ? England under Seven
Administrations.? The selection ranged from 1827 to 1835, during
which period, in little over eight years, the interests of England had
been intrusted in succession to the Canning, Goderich, Wellington,
Grey, Melbourne, Peel, and second Melbourne administrations. The
average duration of a ministry was shorter in England during that
period of political activity than it has been in Victoria; but it
would scarcely be considered a liberal interpretation of this circum-
stance if a colonial critic declared that the Imperial Parliament had
not patriotism enough to give a decent stability to government.
It may be said, and it must be admitted, that these short-lived
ministries in England belong to periods in some sense exceptional.
But do not the short-lived ministries in Australia also belong to an
exceptional period 1 They belong to the period when self-govern-
ment is first established, and the people are still unfamiliar with its
machinery ; when the mutual courtesy and forbearance which result
from organised parties have only begun to exist; and when great
fundamental questions which move vehemently the passions of men
are still in course of settlement. It will be observed that the
duration of Government has gradually increased in the colonies, as it
gradually increased in England ; and I submit that, unless men start
with the idea that colonies are hound to be in the exact frame of
mind and train of circumstances which prevail in England at the
moment, instead of being in the frame of mind which prevailed
in England at something like a corresponding period, there is no
just ground for wonder or complaint in the duration of Australian
ministries.


It is a curious fact that if the colonies desired to retort the charge
of political instability upon England, they could make a much more
effective case. In 1838 a select committee of the House of Commons
reported that one main cause of the misunderstanding between
Canada and the Home government was the constant fluctuation of
men and opinions in the Colonial Office; there were eight new Secre-
taries of State for the Colonies appointed in little over ten years ;
each with a new policy, more or less differing from that of his prede-
cessors. But so little change for the better did this remonstrance
produce that a dozen years ago, when the Australian colonies were
negotiating the bases of their new constitutions, they had actually to
deal with five separate ministers holding the seals of the Colonial
Office within three years.
But our critics propose to furnish us with a more stable executive,
nominated, no doubt, by the mysterious official whom the late
Charles Buller named ? Mr. Mothercountry.? I wonder whether it is
entirely forgotten how that system worked, when men of intellect
seriously speculate upon the possibility of imposing it anew upon a
million of people owning a territory as large as Europe, and who
have tasted self-government 1
The stable executive of old, existing before responsible government
was conceded to the colonies, was often recruited from persons of
reputation too damaged for promotion in England; and it followed as a
natural consequence that they not unfrequently plundered the State by
defalcation or by monopolising the public lands. At best, they were
persons having no necessary sympathy with the community whose
interests were entrusted to them, and they were sometimes wantonly
and viciously opposed to them. They were so incompetent that, as
Mr. Chapman, now a judge in New Zealand, informs us, it was
sometimes necessary, even in the torpid and submissive councils,
nominated in a large part by the governor, to appoint a spokesman
to interpret the policy of the stable executive, which did not contain
a single man capable of defending his own measures in debate. But,
without going back to the dark ages of colonial misgovernment, is it
forgotten what sort of a stable executive was exported to the colonies
as recently as the short interval between the Australian States
framing their constitution and the Imperial Parliament confirming
them, not quite a dozen years ago 1 In the Times of August 4th,
1854, one may read these weighty words ;
The neighbouring colonies of Victoria and South Australia will learn that
a judge has been appointed to the Supreme Court of the former who had
never sat on a seat of justice, and who had compromised himself by corrupt
promises to electors ; while very soon after a governor has been appointed
to the latter colony in his twenty-ninth year, utterly new to office, and
rather too well-known for his dealings on the turf and the Stock Exchange.
~ . . The colonies must be flattered, both by the general repugnance
to their society shown by Englishmen who have anything else to look to, and
by the sort of men that we think good enough for their highest offices.


They will naturally begin to consider whether the colonies cannot do for
themselves as well as we can do for them.
The colonies have begun to consider, and ended considering this
point, I apprehend. Colonists are rather given to exaggerate their
political differences, and to make the most of the sins and short-
comings of their political adversaries, and are answerable, I have no
doubt, for much of the misapprehension which exists in England
respecting our adopted home ; but it has never been my fortune to
meet with a colonist who had the smallest desire to replace his free
government by the sort of thing which constituted a stable executive.
It will be admitted, I trust, that there is not quite so clear a case
against Australia upon this head as had been commonly supposed.
Other ideas which have gathered round this central one are just as
idle and exaggerated. ? All this perpetual agitation in Australia,?
an eminent man said to me lately, ? is about absolutely nothing that
any one can comprehend.? Not quite about nothing. The smallest
of the colonies, for example, is a country as large as England and
Wales, more fertile and under a far more genial sky, where the
public lands have only in a small degree become private property.
There were till recently forty millions of acres to dispose of, and the
question which most habitually divided parties was the principle
upon which they ought to be distributed by the State ?in large
estates, as in England, or in numerous small estates, as upon the
Continent. Ido not know what country in Europe had a larger
question than this to deal with. Again I have been asked, ? Have
not the legislatures fallen into the hands of inferior men, and the
best men been excluded?? Speaking of the entire period over which
parliamentary government has existed, I believe that the men most
unequivocally competent for the management of public affairs have
habitually been in parliament. It must be remembered that in a
new country men of ability have various other work to do as urgent
as the work of legislation. The discovery and development of the
wonderful resources of the country ; rendering easier the extrac-
tion of gold ; improving the quality of stock ; planting new indus-
tries, and enriching the land with plants and animals which nature
had denied to it, are works as urgent as perfecting the laws and
institutions. Good men, it is true, are sometimes excluded for a
time by a gust of popular passion, just as some of the most eminent
men in England lost their seats for opposing Lord Palmerston. A few
years ago, in New South Wales, several able men were excluded on a
popular question at a general election, but these identical men con-
stitute the leading members of the present Government of that colony.
In Victoria, at the close of last year, several able men were excluded
on a question which moved the passions of the people, but they will
no doubt re-appear in the same way as happened in New South
Wales and in England.


Again, it is said the parliament and people of Australia sometimes
commit mistakes and run after delusions. Let us say they do; what
people of whom we have any knowledge are free from the same
charge 1 Eleven years ago, when I was leaving for Australia, the
whole peopleof Englandseemedtobe in a frenzy of enthusiasm in favour
of war on behalf of the Grand Turk. How many of them retain their
enthusiasm on that subject at present 1 In truth, the people of Aus-
tralia are no worse in this respect than any other people, and the mis-
take consists in setting up an ideal standard of wisdom and modera-
tion for them to which no community can reach. I am far from
desiring to prefer any exaggerated or extravagant claims on the part
of the colonies. Blame them where they are open to blame, by all
means; but be sure of your facts. Blame them where blame is
reasonable; but it is not reasonable if the ground of complaint
substantially is that Australia is not England. Ho sensible man
will expect absolute identity of views or of practice between the
young communities and the old community; he will remember that
the colonies are not mere branches of the Imperial tree, but saplings
from the same root, flourishing in a soil and under conditions of their
. own, which render some modifications of structure inevitable. He
will keep in view the fact that he is dealing with States in the second
decade of their years, which had to be organised out of the social
chaos created by the sudden assembly of large masses of men with
no previous knowledge of each other, and hardly any common
interest beyond the preservation of order. They are in process of
growing, and have grown with singular rapidity, but he will not
expect to find in the first stage of their growth the gifts and accom-
plishments which belong only to maturity. A settled public opinion,
the reserve of conscious strength and fixed rules of practice in public
transactions, are attained by communities only after struggle and
discipline. A colonial parliament?the organ of a young, vigorous
people ?has pressing work to do, and is at that state of
its progress when impatience of delay is natural and healthy,
as implying sincerity and earnestness. The House of Commons,
in the time of the Stuarts, was in a somewhat similar stage,
and passed through a long apprenticeship marked with not
a few paroxysms of passion and fits of torpor before it
settled down into the effective instrument it has become. Ho
turbulence which can be truly attributed to the Australian parlia-
ments, and nothing which malice or ignorance has invented in
respect to them, is more than a pale reflection of incidents in the
parliamentary struggle which commenced with John Pym, and is ap-
parently not quite ended yet. Piemember this fact always, that England
has no longer any interest in colonies separate from the interests of
the colonists; and the interests of the colonists cannot have been
grossly neglected where public credit has been maintained, where
public order has been preserved without interruption, and has been


allied with social and material progress, and with individual liberty
as perfect as exists anywhere on the earth. But there is a higher
consideration which ought to guide English criticism. The Aus-
tralian colonists possess, and fortunately know that they possess, one
of the freest and most serviceable constitutions in existence; but the
more universally they recognise the fact, the better and more stable
government will necessarily become; for order rests upon public
content as its basis. It follows that any criticism calculated to disturb
this content ought to be made only upon sure grounds; and that not
only wilful, but even ignorant, disparagement of the institutions upon
which it depends by writers or speakers of authority amounts to a
grave offence. The colonial statesman has difficulties to face from which
the English statesman is nearly altogether free. In England the bones
and sinews which sustain and move the body politic, and constitute
the vital machinery of the State, are covered by flowing robes of
ceremony, and custom forbids too close an inspection of the august
and mystic organism beneath. In Australia you have only the
naked ribs and vertebrae, possessed with a vigorous principle of life
indeed, but with scarce a rag of traditional veneration to shelter
them from inquisitive eyes. Reverence and custom, such powerful
agents in the government of States, can scarcely be said to come at
all in aid of authority which has to depend in a large degree upon
its intrinsic strength for acceptance and support. It is not, surely,
the part of an English constitutionalist, whether in parliament or
the press, to increase the natural difficulties of government under
such circumstances. But he does so by unjust criticism, whether
he makes people discontented with its system of government or angry
at the mother country for the misrepresentation of it. In truth, the
maintenance of friendly relations between England and her great
colonies has passed from the care of the Colonial Office to the care
of public opinion and its interpreters. There are no longer questions
of right to determine, and scarcely any question of mutual interest
to regulate, from which difficulties can spring; but the ties that
remain, those of sympathy and kindred, are always highly sensitive.
The chief peril lies, I think, in the offensive superiority which Eng-
lishmen who remain in England are somtimes inclined to assume
over Englishmen who have left England. The Irish and the Scotch,
who are an emigrating people, only share this feeling in a small
degree. But the question is not one of feeling and sentiment
exclusively, but is becoming one of national interests. England
interprets between these new countries and all Europe and America,
and she is ushering them into the world with the serious impediment
of a blemished character. The Colony of Victoria, in which I reside,
has never cost the mother country a guinea, has never done or wished
her anything but good, has exhibited her sympathy in a practical way
on many trying occasions, has poured upwards of a hundred millions
sterling into the coffers of her trade, and may surely expect not to be


wantonly injured ; and one of her citizens will not be accounted
unreasonable, I trust, if he moves tor a rehearing of her case upon
the ground that the verdict found against her is contrary to the
weight of evidence.
The subjoined account of the debate which followed is taken from
the Star : ?
Mr. Marsh, M.P., who had been a member of the Legislative
Council of New South Wales, adduced, as an instance of the high
state of civilisation which existed in Queensland, the fact that at a
dinner given to him in Brisbane the company, to the number of
from two hundred to three hundred, all wore white neckcloths.
(Laughter). The finances of New South Wales were now in a hope-
less state, and in Victoria they were going back in political civilisation,
and were quarrelling about Free-trade and Protection. Property was
not secure in the colony?stock, horses, and cows being constantly
stolen and there was a bad system of police, which was caused by
political jobbery. The magistrates were wholly unfit for their duties,
and he had the best authority for stating that the members of the
Victorian Parliament were in the habit of receiving bribes ranging
from ï¿½lO to ï¿½7OO. 6 *
Mr. Duffy asked the hon. gentleman to give a single authoritative
case in which a member of the Victorian Parliament received a bribe.
.Mr. B. Hawes, Vice-president of the society, thought it a great
mistake for Englishmen to be finding fault with the colonies which
grew from them. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Hart, lately Chief Secretary of South Australia, said he did
not believe the picture which Mr. Marsh drew applied to South
Australia. Free-trade was in favour there, and the finances were in
an excellent condition. No doubt, in certain colonies, the people
were of a roving description, and universal suffrage did not work
well, but in South Australia, where the people owned the land,
universal suffrage and the ballot worked well. Notwithstanding
what Mr. Marsh said of the colony, he (Mr. Hart) would go back to
it, for it was his home. (Applause.)
Sir John Gray, M.P., said he had not a few friends who con-
templated emigration to Australia; but he feared when he told
them of the ? white-choker? civilisation the hon. gentleman (Mr.
Marsh) so much praised, and of that other peculiar kind of civilisa-
tion which seemed to demand another sort of choker (laughter),
they would be inclined to stay at home. The hon. gentleman attri-
buted all this to something peculiar in the institutions of Australia;
but he (Sir John Gray) had heard of cows and horses being stolen in
England; and as to bushranging, he had heard of such a thing as
garotting in the City of London. And yet he had not heard any
gentleman in the House of Commons or elsewhere attribute the


garotting to the evils of government, or to the corruption of the
representatives of the people. (Loud cheers).
Mr. Gilpin, M.P., with reference to the charge of corruption
brought against the Australian representatives by Mr. Marsh, said
every one knew what England was in the time of the Walpoles, and
yet nothing was ever known to occur in Australia so bad as in this
country.
Mr. Duffy, in reply to Mr. Brady, M.P., said that the Colonial
legislature was composed of extreraely-useful men, who, perhaps,
would never find their way into the House of Commons, and would
be- very much out of place if they did. As to the relations between
the home government and the colony, he thought that the govern-
ment and parliament of the colony, having free institutions and
preserving its connection with the Crown, had a right to deal with
the affairs of the colony in the same way as the Parliament of
England had with the affairs of this country. With respect to the
connection between the colony and the Colonial Office, he might say
that the latter had taken the extremely discreet course of interfering
as little as possible with the colony. The only power exercised by
the Colonial Office which caused complaint was the power to veto
bills. When the executive government and the parliament assented
to a bill, it came to England, and some gentlemen in Downing-street
put a veto upon it. That, no doubt, would soon cease.
? A cordial vote of thanks, carried by acclamation, was accorded to
Mr. Duffy, and the proceedings terminated.
