WHAT is the value of our Australian books 1 Do they represent the
moral consciousness of an age, a race, or a country, or are they either
the history of a new continent, or even the materials out of which such a his-
tory can or must be written! Have they added in any way to the intel-
lectual wealth of the world, either in the fields of science, or philosophy, or
poetry, or religion ? Or do they but take up so much space—often grud-
gingly accorded them-—on book shelves, and as theM-'are unregarded and
unread, so must any attempt to create an interest in them be but a vain
effort to re-animate the dead ?
Before the lifting of the mist which had so long veiled our continent
from the advancing civilization of Western Europe, Australia was another
Atlantis, and this idea has its most pronounced expression in the New Dis-
covery of Terra Incognita Australis by James Sadeur , written by Gabriel de
Foigny, an ex-grey friar, published in Yannes in 1676, reprinted in Paris
in 1692, and translated into English and printed in London in 1693. In
its English dress this work is somewhat scarce —but prophecy had died out
before the seventeenth century, so while it purposes to be all about Aus-
tralia, it is in reality based on the wealth of the two Indies and the sen-
suous, luxuriant growth of the Spice Islands, and no real light from our
Southern Land had entered into the mind of the ingenious Frenchman.
■So late as 1726, Dean Swift searching the map of the world for a vacant
and suitable place for his Kingdom of Lilliput fixed on a site “ north-west
of Van Dieman’s Land.” which—for he gives his latitudes and longitudes
—is occupied by part of Australia. But the mythical department is
neither large nor important, and as the mist is cleared off by Portugese, it
may be also by French, and very certainly by Dutch navigators, the exist-
ence of successors to James Sadeur and Lemuel Gulliver became an impos-
sibility.
Of the voyages of the earlier Australian navigators we have been con-
tent to accept the translations of Callander, Dalrymple, and latterly, Major,
but ours are days of “ Revision Companies,” and it may be that some light
is hidden by faulty, or blundering renderings. In 1688 an Englishman,
William Dampier, places his foot on Australia, and realises for himself and
his countrymen the truth that had to take the place of the myths. Colum-
bus on landing on the new western world, or to be a little more precise, on
Guanahane, or San Salvador, for he never landed on the mainland, “ threw
himself on his knees, kissed the earth, and returned thanks to God with
tears of joy.” Surely Dampier too had an occasion for some sentiment,
but he was a stolid John Bull and a Buccaneer at that, and neither posing
as a discoverer or a re-discoverer, all the poetry we get out of him is of
this kind :—“ On the 4th of January, 1688, we fell in with the land in the


latitude of 16deg., SOminutes,” or “New Holland is a very large tract of
land.” Yet he has the merit of being a stern recorder of facts ; the
Austral race when it becomes extinct will still live on his terse and pro-
saic page, where too the uninviting shores of Shark’s Bay and a continent
teeming with a race of hunters (not that he valued them) are limned with
the precision of “ holding the mirror up to nature.” Nor do our obligations
to him end there. With a forethought for which we can never be thankful
enough, he compiled the first vocabulary of the Austral tongue and brought
back with him a collection of plants, which Robert Brown examined and
classified more than a hundred years afterwards.
After Dampier’s visit the interest of Europe in the Southern world was,
judging by the absence of published voyages, small, nor is this to be won--
dered at. The quest of the early navigators was one for gold or at least
silver, and Australia as it appeared to them was entirely destitute of these
precious metals, so that while the discovery of America was a delightful
surprise, that of Australia was an intense disappointment. Still we were
not quite forgotten. The collection of voyages (edited by De Brosses),
published in Paris in 1750, entitled Historic des Navigationes aux Torres
Australes was sufficiently important to find an English translator and a
sponsor in John Callander, who, however, though he incorporates some ad-
ditional matter, makes but scanty acknowledgment to the French work from
which the great bulk of his was taken. The first volume of Callander’s
Terra Australis Cognita appeared in Edinburgh in 1766, volumes two and
three appearing two years afterwards. For many years this was consi-
dered the starting point of Australian history, and the importance of the
voyages chronicled in it, including Dampier’s and Pelsart’s, and the three
maps by Yaugondy will always make it a work of great interest and value.
In 1767 Alexander Dalrymple printed for private circulation an Account
of the Discoveries made in the South Pacific Ocean previous to 1764, which
was shortly afterwards published, and it and the Terra Australis Cognita
were reviewed together in the Monthly Review for May, 1768, when Cal-
lander came in for much praise, while Dalrymple was told that the voy-
ages promised by him in a future publication seemed to be unnecessary as
having already appeared in various forms, and particularly in Terra Aus-
tralis Cognita. This notice to a man with a bad temper and with a motive
in view in the issue of his book —and Dalrymple had both—was eminently
unsatisfactory, and he resented it by publishing within the same year the
first volume of his quarto Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and
Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, which was completed by the issue
of a second volume in 1771, and of which we will afterwards hear from
Captain Cook. Ignoring Yaugoiidy’s chart Dalrymple issued a new one,
based (as was that of Harris’s Collection of Voyages and Travels , 17If f
on that of the East India Company of Holland, in the Stadt-house, at Am-
sterdam, showing not a problematical continent, but the principal points
touched at in Australasian Seas by Neyra (1595), Quiros (1606), Torres
(1606), Le Maire and Schouten (1617), Tasman (1642), and Roggewein
(1722), but still with a considerable error in the longitudes as in Yau-
gondy’s charts. Apart from that error and though somewhat affected and
stilted, the work is one of great merit, and, with what facts there were
available, a reliable one. He speaks with no doubt as to the existence of
Australia :—“ The southern continent having been seen on the west side


by Tasman iin 1642, and on the east by Juan Fernandez half a century
before, and bby others after him in different latitudes from 64deg. to 40deg.
south, it is inmpossible for any one at this time to discover it.” This has a
sound of accuuracy, yet we know that 40deg. S. intersects Bass’s Straits,
while 64 misssses the whole of Tasmania and is far on its way to the An-
tartic Pole. Though outside of ray present purpose I would mention that
the cataloguae of the York-gate Library (S. W. Silver’s) mentions two other
works of Dalilrymple’s in reference to Australasia -.—On the Conveyance of
Domestic Annimals to New Zealand, 1771, and On the Intended Thief Colony
at Botany Bday (M. S.), 1786.
Up to 17668 Callander’s and Dalrymple’s books formed the history, and
the bibliograpphy too, of Australia, and, so far, all the voyages had been in-
tensely utilittarian —the result of either national or personal selfishness—
but now Geeorge the Third was King and the early years of his reign
formed a new era. Science, literature, and art were to be encouraged and
promoted forr their own sakes, and in the same year (1768) that a charter
is given to tlhe Royal Academy, an expedition is sent out with the twofold
object of exploring the Southern Seas and observing the transit of Yenus of
the 3rd of Jrane, 1769. The outfit of the expedition was modest enough.
It consisted cof a single vessel of 350 tons under the command of Captain
James Cook,, who had previously earned a reputation both for able sea-
manship and I for the accuracy of his surveys, and with him were associated
two naturalissts (Banks and Solander), an astronomer (Green), a draughts-
man (Buc-ham), and a painter (Parkinson). What is commonly known as
Cook’s First Voyage, is a good deal more than that being :—“ An Account
of Voyages umdertaken by order of His Majesty for making Discoveries in
the Southern Hemishere, and successfully performed by Commodore Byron,
Captain Walllis, [Captain Cartaret, and Captain James Cook, drawn up from
the Journalst which were kept by the several Commanders, and from the
papers of Joseph Banks, Esq., by John Hawkesworth, D.D.f three volumes,
quarto, 1773.. Dr. Hawkesworth got £6OOO for his editorial labours, and,
on their completion, much abuse from the reviewers of the day. Out of
keeping with the large sum paid to the editor, and to the importance of
the work done by the expeditions, the typography of the volumes is mean
and this meanness the illustrations (though Wollett is one of the en-
gravers) both share and help to create. Of these latter only five refer to
Australia. Three charts, including the general one of the eastern coast,
are necessarily of the greatest importance, but the view of the Endeavour
River, with the barque aground for the purpose of being repaired, is without
any especial local characteristics, while that of the “ kanguroo ” would
have no interest save that it is the first representation of an Australian
animal which had appeared in the domain of art. Putting Cook’s claims
to be an actual discoverer on one side, the continent has on his chart an
assured eastern side of over two thousand miles; we have at last longitudes
of comparative accuracy, and Hawkesworth’s book, despite its shortcom-
ings, is an important addition to our still scanty Australian literature.
After .Cook’s visit the Australs had a final respite from European in-
trusion for nearly eighteen, years—until the arrival of the ‘‘ first fleet ” to
found the settlement at Botany Bay, on the 18th to 20th January, 1788
—and from this new point our Australian books, while they rapidly in-
crease in number, have a new interest for Englishmen, being no longer the


records of gold hunters—though that dream too will have its frequent re-
vivals, and, within three-quarters of a century, its realization—but the his-
tory of a British settlement under the Southern Cross. Immediately after
the return of the vessels which formed this “ first fleet,” bringing with
them records of what had been done in the infant colony, the London
press began to pour out accounts of the voyage and of the progress of the
settlement. Tench’s Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay and the
Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay appeared in 1789, White’s
Voyage to New South Wales in 1790, Hunter’s Historical Journal of the
Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island , and Tench's Complete
Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson in 1793, Colhns’ Account of the
English Coloyiy in New South Wales in 1798-1802 and as a fitting sequel
to the series. Grant’s Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery in the Lady Nel-
son, in 1803, all of which, with the exception of Tench’s Narrative , are in
quarto and, with the exception of Tench’s two works all are illustrated by
charts and copper-plate engravings of scenery and objects o r novel interest
—and it is all novel—in natural history. Naturally enough the fauna oc-
cupy a predominating share in these plates—the quadrupeds from their
entire novelty, and the birds from their exceeding beauty. Of fish and
shells the plates are few and unimportant. those of plants altogether
insignificant. In the landscapes however we have a history within a his-
tory. Beginning with Phillip’s Voyage we have a view of Botany Bay,
which with the exception that it shows three ships inside the heads and the
remainder of the fleet about to enter —an amount of shipping which pos-
sibly that neglected port never bad on its waters since that time—might,
so far as realism is concerned, have been drawn a few years ago, possibly
even to-day. The view in Port Jackson is merely a representation of some
blacks in their canoes fishing off Garden Island, but a crowded sea high-
way now occupies the space, and the blacks and their canoes like Arthur
and his barge,
* # m “ p ass on anc i on? and go,
Prom less to less and vanish into light.”
Hunter’s Journal came out four years later, but one of its landscapes
(all of which are by E. Dayes after Hunter’s own sketches) is of Sydney
on the 20th August. 1788, a little less than six months after the landing.
In it you can see that good progress had been made in clearing off the
timber; there are a few scattered huts on either side of the Cove ; and
the Tank-stream is still fringed with the primeval forest. When we come-
down to Collins’ Account, and the colony has had an existence of about
ten years, we see in Sydney the barracks, new and old—neither of which
has had any existence for ages past, save on these old plates—with a file
of soldiers on march ; stockades and numerous huts ; Australia too has
got a windmill ; the road to Parramatta passes by the the Brickfield-hill;
the Tanic-stream still meanders to the Cove ; and the Cove has a rudi-
mentary wooden pier. At Parramatta walks have been formed in the
Domain (they are to-day bordered with giant English oaks), while the
Governor’s cottage there has an avenue of prisoners’ huts leading to it, and
the “ Stocks ” are handily situated in the foreground of the picture. In
Grant’s Voyage possibly the most important plate is that showing the
mouth of the Coal River, or Hunter with the Nobby,” the index to


the mineral wealth of some thousands of miles of country, standing soli
tarily in the middle of the estuary. Nor are the illustrations of these
early histories confined to these landscapes, invaluable though they are.
Thomas Stothard and William Blake are here in rivalry—not yet over a
“ Canterbury Pilgrimage,” but in giving representations of groups of
our blacks—-and both plates are entirely representative, not indeed of the
blacks, but of these two famous masters of English art —the graceful Stot-
hard depicting a black “gin” drawn in Watteau fashion on Academy models,
and Blake if he does not know his Austral, shows at least the hand of the
“ Mystic of Fountain Court.” And this is only a part of the story as told in
the illustrations : the story itself is that of 1030 persons landed on Dam-
pier’s “ very large tract of land ” with no neighbours but his “ savages
how these immigrants struggled and vanquished seemingly endless and
ever recurring difficulties ; farmed the valley of the Hawkesbury, and
opened out the mineral wealth of that of the Hunter ; increased their
herds and flocks ; established homes for themselves and us ; and formed
the nucleus not only of Australia to-day, but of that of the future —and who
among us will dream what that may be in another century? And these
historians were eye-witnesses and chief actors, and their stories have the
accuracy and the life which such men could give.
So far the writers I have named, from Phillip to Grant, were imperial
officers, who writing from the stand-point of the quarter deck and the
Government quarters found an audience among those who could afford to
pay from one to two guineas per volume, and at such prices Phillip’s Voy-
age went to a second and even to a third edition—though the last is a
shabby royal octavo with worn and folded plates—and Collins’ Account to
an abridged second, in one volume. But the interest in Botany Bay, their a
generic name for Australia, was not confined to the people who could afford
to buy such costly books—the great-reading public is never so reached—
while the criminal class, ever large in big towns, and with a distinctive
literature of its own, would naturally wish to know both what their former
associates were doing and something of tin; new settlement, which it was
within the probabilities would sooner or later be their own destination. Even
apart from this it would be of great interest if, as a set-off to the semi-official
accounts, there were one of the same incidents as viewed from the hulks and
’tween decks of the transports, and, professedly at all events, we have such
in the works which were published with the name of George Barrington
as their author.
Barrington’s Voyage to Botany Bay was first published in 1795, and
within the following year went to a third edition-—of which latter there is
a copy in the Public Library, a small octavo of (exclusive of title, dedication,
and contents) 135 pages and published at half-a-crown. It is a poor per-
formance—little more than a long, rambling, and badly written letter—
and though there are no facts in it which might not have been put to-
gether by any reader of the quartos which preceded it, yet from its poverty
of style, its moderate self-exaltation, and because its inconsistencies after
all are such that a new arrival might have fallen into, it probably is what
it professes to be—the genuine work of George Barrington. The voyage
is that of the “ tV' emarle,” which arrived in Sydney on the 13th October,
1791, but the pas; ■ r 'e in one transport would be (save in the matter of
provisions which v . , o in some cases disgracefully short or bad) very much


like that in any other, while the want of that novelty which surrounded
the first fleat was compensated for by a mutiny which took place on board
of Barrington’s vessel. The popularity of the book was immense ; not
merely were new editions being called for in London, but it was reprinted
in several English towns, and even in America. In the Public Library
there is a copy of a chap-book edition of it of 48 pages, published at six-
pence, with the date carefully obliterated, which appears not only to be a
piracy, but impudent at that, for it has the imprint of £; A. Swindells,
Hanging-bridge, Manchester.” Was there ever a printer with such a
name, or such a place in Manchester as Hanging-bridge—if so the eternal
fitness of things had a remarkable illustration—or was the imprint merely
an additional attraction for buyers at country fairs and throughout the pro-
vinces'! Without, as I have said, any new facts or any literary merit to
commend it, this Voyage was nevertheless a splendid commercial success
to which its comparative cheapness and its author’s previous reputation
largely contributed. With the publication of Collins’ Account it must have
been evident that the interest in the voyage of the fleet had altogether
faded into the scenes which happened a few years afterwards at Port Jack-
son, and to meet a new demand, we have a History of New /South Wales,
of which Barrington is again the nominal author, but whatever doubts
there may be about the authorship of the earlier work, it seems certain
that he never wrote the later. Barrington’s name was a splendid sign-
board. Than the fashionable Dublin and London pickpocket—a very
prince of the fraternity, whose own defence, when on his trial (if it were
possible to believe his Newgate-street biographers) was only surpassed by
Eugene Ai’am’a—who so fit to record the crimes, the defences, or when need
be, the last dying speeches and confessions of the men whose faults, or, as
it sometimes was, misfortunes he could so well understand 1 So the
Newgate-street litterateurs set to work on Collins’ book and made sausage-
meat of it for the delectation of the readers of Jack Sheppard, Jonathan
Wild, The Terrific Register , and the Mystery of the Red Barn. Even
apart from Barrington’s statement that he had nothing to do with the
work—and we have no reason to doubt his word, for he had determined
to lead an entirely new life and his residence in the colony abundantly
proved that he both reached and maintained the high standard he
had laid down for himself—there is internal evidence of its being
neither less nor more than a piece of London handicraft. There is
e the absurd dedication to His Majesty—Barrington, the holder of an
emancipation ticket, and “ Superintendent of the convicts at Parramatta ”
laying down his History of New South Wcdes at the feet of the King,
while much that is new in the incidents is of such a character as to re-
quire confirmation, which is not forthcoming, from other sources. From
the preface it appears that the work, which came out in numbers, was com-
pleted in 1802, and the title-page announces that it is “enriched with
beautiful coloured prints ” —in reality with wretched aquatints daubed
with colours which when they are not copied from Collins’ are as pitiful
and absurd as ever accompanied a book. M. Jones, then of Paternoster
Row, was the publisher, and the commercial success was again such that
he determined to bring out —also in numbers (twelve at one shilling each),
and with illustrations of the same character—a new and now largely
padded edition of the Voyage to which In* prefaced the Life, Trials, and


Speeches of George Barrington. The writer of this biography was evidently
a man who understood his business, and this is what he says of his hero’s
celebrated speech : —“ Having thus concluded a speech which for the neat-
“ ness of the language and the pathos that ran through the whole, has
“ never been exceeded at the bar, he left it with a respectful bow and thus
“ withdrew from public life in Europe, to act a part in the new world ;
“ and though in a different sphere, yet not much less distinguished than
“before.” In 1810, M. Jones, who in the interval had moved from the
Row to Newgate-street issued a final edition of the work—the History —the
work being continued from papers said to have been bequeathed to a friend
by Barrington, whose death is announced as having taken place within a few
months of the publication of the first edition. Without this History we
should not have had the famous “ Prologue,” which the Dictionary of
National Biography , edited by Leslie Stephen and now in course of pub-
lication, says was written by Barrington, used on the occasion of the pro-
duction of the first play in Sydney, and for which it predicts a popularity
as enduring as our language. I accept the panegyric, but challenge the
facts. The first performance of a play in Sydney was on the 4th of June,
1789, the anniversary of the King’s birthday, while all that Barrington’s
History says about the lines is to quote them as forming a “ curious pro-
logue spoken on the occasion ” of the opening of the first theatre there, on
16th of January, 1795, and as being “particularly descriptive” of the
actors. Not merely is it quite clear that Barrington never wrote, was in-
deed incapable of writing the lines, but it is, to me, equally so that they
could not have been spoken on the occasion at all. Collins has a fairly
long notice of the performance and of the merits and dresses.of the actors,
quoting even their motto:—“We cannot command success but will en-
deavour to deserve it,” but says nothing about the prologue, which, if it
had been spoken, would in itself, from such actors and to such an audience,
have been the most astounding piece of “ play ” ever enacted before the foot-
lights. It is simply an absurdity to suppose such a thing possible, but it
may be that the compiler of the book forced to write down to the style of
Barrington’s Voyage for the History , showed his own in the prologue. The
books bearing the name of Barrington were the most popular which were
ever written about Australia, but who wrote them appears to be a
secret as profound as was the authorship of the Letters of Junius
fifty years ago. A bibliography of Australia, when we get one, may
throw much light on the matter; this only we know now, that
Waldron of Dublin or Maynooth, who went to a levee at St. James’s
and robbed a nobleman of a diamond order, who subsequently robbed
Prince Orloff of a gold snuff-box, set with brilliants said to have been
worth £30,000, and who as George Barrington was convicted and tran-
sported to New South W 7 ales where he led a blameless life, had very little
to do with them.
Though a printing press was sent out with the first fleet it was not until
November, 1795, that a then lately arrived prisoner, was able to produce
the first examples of Australian typography. These were “ Government
Orders,” but almost at the same time Governor Hunter allowed Mr. Muir,
one of the famous Scotch martyrs, to print, which he did with his own
hands, portions of the Scriptures for the use of his fellow prisoners. On
the sth of March, 1803, George Howe published “ by authority ” the first


number of ihe Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser.
Having thus sketched the bibliography of Australia to 1803, when the
histories of the “ first fleet ” and of the early days of the settlement had
been published ; the press in Sydney at work in a modest way for over
seven years ; and a newspaper in existence, it would no longer be possible
within the limits of this paper to carry down a description of the books in
their chronological order; and I purpose only referring to the literary out-
turn of the voyages of Flinders and Fitzroy, and, glancing at our Botany
Bay Calendar literature and the Austral race, leave for a future
occasion, should the Historical Society deem such a paper suitable, the re- y
mainder of the coast surveys, the inland explorations, the histories, the
poetry, the paradoxes, and the large mass of pamphlet literature.
Cook landed at only five points on the whole of the eastern coast: —
Botany Bay, Bustard Bay, Thirsty Sound, Endeavour River, and Point
Lookout, and all that had been done before at isolated points on the north,
west, and south sides of the continent required to be gone over again both to
connect these points and to fit the whole into Cook’s eastern coast line. The
blanks which required filling in were numerous. Van Dieman’s Land was still
a possible part of the Continent, and even the eastern coast itself required
to be examined for rivers which Cook, though his route was at a com-
paratively short distance from the land had, singularly, failed to discover.
There was therefore much still to be done and the next important stages
of progress are recorded in Flinders’ Voyage to Terra Australis: under-
taken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country and
prosecuted in the years 1801-2-3 —two volumes with an atlas in imperial
folio, published at eight guineas and issued in 1814, the year in which its
author died. The work is even more than a record of the discoveries made
in the “Investigator,” “Porpoise,” and “Cumberland,” which Flinders
successively commanded during the period named, for he summarises as
well all that was then known of the earlier discoveries and tells the sad
story of his long imprisonment of nearly six and a half years by the French
in Mauritius, which island he left on the 13th June, 1810. Flinders
circumnavigated the continent, determined the position of many impor-
tant points, but he, too, failed to discover the important rivers on the east
coast as Cook had done before him. He says; —“ No river of importance
intersects the east coast between the 24 and 39 deg. of south latitude,”
thus missing among others, the Clarence, navigable by ocean steamers for
over fifty miles and with an efflux of water estimated to be nearly equal
to that of the Murrav. Btill the general contour of Australia given
on his charts is such as it remains to this day. Mr. Crossley was the
astronomer of the expedition, and now time-keepers were in use, so that
there was every reason to expect accurate resells and the ex-
pectation was realized. Hitherto the botany of Australia had been
sadly neglected but Robert Brown came out in the “ Investigator,” and ac-
companying Flinders until the latter started for England, remained
here—he had intended to await Flinders’ return—until 1805. Brown
published his Frodromus Flora} Nova‘ Hollandice in 1810, and, for Flin-
ders’ book, goes over the field again with a monograph of the Botany of
Terra Australis , which occupies eighty-one pages. In addition to his
own collection Brown had access to those ot Dampier, Bir Joseph
Banks, Cayley and others, forming in all about 4200 species and though


our illustrious Baron F. You Mueller, after nearly half a century of self-
denying devotion to his work has carried down the figures to nearly
14,590 species, and with them practically completed the Botany of Aus-
tralia and the immediately adjacent islands, still Brown’s results were
a splendid advance in his day. Mr. Bauer was natural history painter
and the ten botanical plates in the atlas are from his drawings. In the
engraving of the Endeavour River in llawkesworth’s book no attempt
had been made to express Australian plants in the landscape, and this
absence of realism is quite as marked in Phillips’, Hunter’s and Collink’
works, where the trees are rendered on English models and are terribly
conventional at that; but W. Westall, A.R.A. andF.L.S , was the draughts-
man to the “ Investigator,” and his illustrations to Flinders’ remain a monu-
ment both of his power as an artist and of his extreme accuracy in depicting
the flora of our country, and in his plates you will find Banksias, Zamias,
grass-trees, etc., of which there are along our coast living facsimiles to-day.
These drawings had the still further advantage of being translated into en-
gravings by John Pye, Middiman and W. Finden,—some of the most
famous engravers of the day, and who were engaged about the same
time in simiarly rendering the works of J. M. W. Turner. Though
after Flinders’ day the novelty of Australia wore out, it certainly continued
until then, On Kangaroo Island, the animals, after which he named
it, had evideitly never seen a man before ; they allowed themselves to
be knocked 01 the head with sticks and they and the seals, both of
which had besn the chief occupants of the island from time immemor-
ial, appeared “to dwell amicably together.” There, too, he found the
pelican lagooi —-the breeding place for untold generations of these birds
and the horat to which they came to die. On another island he found
the seals in fimilies of about ten lying asleep at every two or three
hundred yards, and such was their want of knowledge of man that he
approached sweral of these families very closely without their taking
the least notce of him. Though Lieutenant Murray w T as the first dis-
coverer of P(rt Phillip, Flinders was an early visitor to its waters, and
he gives a loig account of his visit and his views as to its early settle-
ment and future importance. In these early days either a trip to the new
southern lane helped to foster genius, or else the number of really
great men in the world was small, and Australia had an unusually
large share (f them as spectators of the unveiling of its splendours.
To this rule Hinders’ voyage was no exception ; the commander himself,
and Westall aid Brown attained celebrity through it while the midship-
man, John Fnnklin, lived to attain his chiefly as an explorer in the
Arctic seas.
The voyages hitherto referred to had been undertaken with special
reference to Australia and I now select one —that of Captain Fitzroy in
the “ Beagle ’ —which had no such immediate object, and yet from which
most importait results accrued to us. Fitzroy spent much time in Magel-
lanica and on the east and west coasts of southern South America, calling
also at Hew Zealand and Hobart Town, but of all that he had seen Sydney
pleased him riost. With the exception of the canals, which are wanting
to this day, to saw in the capital of Hew South Wales a complete realiza-
tion of the gbwing picture pourtrayed in the elder Dr. Darwin’s famous
linos prefixed to Phillips’ Voyage , but the picture seemed to him altogether


too bright and beautiful to last. The Sydney he saw consisted of about
twenty thousand inhabitants, and this is its forecast as told by the man
who afterwards became celebrated as a weather prophet. “It is difficult
“to believe that Sydney will continue to flourish in proportion to its rise.
“It has sprung into existence too suddenly. Convicts have forced its
“ growth, even as a hot-bed forces plants, and premature decay may be ex-
“ pected from such early maturity. '* * * If our government establish-
“ ment would be withdrawn, from that day the decline of the city would
“ commence, because its natural advantages are not sufficient to compete
“ with other places in those regions excepting while fostered by the pres-
“ ence of regularly paid government officers, troops, and a large convict
“establishment.” Within ten years transportation ceased, the imperial
staff was gradually withdrawn and yet—prophecy notwithstanding
Sydney to-day has a population of over 200,000.
The immediate result of the “ Beagle’s” voyage was the publication in
1839 of the four volunes entitled a Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of
the 11 Adventure” and “Beagle,” of which the second by Fitzroy and the third
by Charles Darwin have the more especial interest to Australians. In the
former of these, in addition to the description of Sydney in 1836 and its
forecast, there is a marvellous chapter on the Noachian Deluge which re-
mained unparalleled until Captain Hyndmau delivered and published a
lecture on the same subject in Sydney in 1862 : he who “bundles para-
doxes ” may well add both of these to his treasures. Darwin tells us what
he saw of the Blue Mountains and the Falls of the Weatherboard, the
latter now known it may be more euphoniously, but certainly less happily
historically, as Katoomba, but his volume has been frequently reprinted
under the title of a Naturalist's Voyage round the World, and of it and of
the author subsequently of the Origin of Species, it is unnecessary to say
anything here. In the list of supernumeraries on board the “ Beagle,” in
addition to the name of Charles Darwin, is that of Conrad Martens, who
joining her at Monte Video and leaving at Yalparasio arrived by way of
Tahiti in Sydney before her, and about half of the illustrations in the
Narrative are from his sketches. Martens was a pupil of Copley Fielding
and the representation of the fringe of the rain cloud which was an especial
feature in the hands of the master was so also in those of his pupil when
the latter occasionally introduced it into his drawings. While Westall
was the first to introduce Australian plants into the foregrounds of the
plates to Flinders, it is not too much to say that what he commenced
Martens finished. Gum-trees in all their vigour, or shattered and with the
life in them thrown out into new branches, or dead, ghastly, and denuded of
their bark ; tree ferns ; the epacricidre ; the acacias ; the waratah ; the
cabbage-palms; the currijongs; the dense foliage of the cedar brush—all that
are especially characteristic of the flora of the temperate latitudes of the
eastern coast are in lbs drawings—marred as these latter often are by the
introduction of hideous houses and offices through which too often the
commission came and which, had there been choice, would have been
swept away by the artist’s brush. You may say that this is within the
province of art and not of literature, but in addition to his drawings and
the illustrations to the Beagle’s Voyage, he has left us a work entirely
his own which, while it is one of the most valuable, is also one of the
scarcest of Australian publications. When he arrived here the population


of the colony was small and though there were plenty of materials the
patronage for that class of pictures which he would only produce was
very limited. For many years he adhered to the principle of never ex-
ecuting drawings unless they went commissioned and as the price for a
cabinet-size water-colour was twenty guineas, orders were difficult to get
though he was content if one a month were forthcoming. To occupy his
time, shortly after his arrival he gave lessons to a few private pupils and
(for he had a hobby apart from his art) constructed for his amusement, a
reflecting telescope for which he cast and ground two specula. Just before
the gold discovery there was a period of great monetary depression, and
Martens endeavoured to reach a larger audience than could be got through
his water-colours. The result of this was his series of twenty lithographs,
issued in five parts, at one guinea per part, in oblong folio, entitled Sketches
illustrative of the Scenery of New South Wales , the wrappers of which bear
the date of 1851. Lithography was then in its infancy in Sydney and
Martens had great trouble with his printers. But he put the drawings on
the stones with his own hands and taking each plate after the printer had
done with it, put masterly washes upon it and heightened it with body-
colour so that it bet ame, to some extent, a drawing in itself. He also
tried etching, but that art even as practised in England in the pre
Haden and Hamerton days was harsh, hard, and little in consonance
with the genius of the brilliant draughtsman and he was dissatisfied with
the results he obtained. As an artist and for nearly half a century the
leading, almost the sole exponent of the art of water-colour in Australia,
the name of Conrad Martens will long be remembered in our annals. For
one of those cabinet drawings for which commissions were so slow in com-
ing in while the artist lived, over £63 was given at auction at Gemmeirs
within the last two or three years. Nor do the names of Fitzroy, Darwin
and Martens exhaust the list of those who, first known to us in this trip
of the “Beagle,” rendered us valuable geographical or literary services, for J,
C. Wickham was lieutenant and J. HStokes mate and assistant surveyor on
the expedition.
Some reference must necessarily be made to the books which collectively
form what may be called the Botany Bay Calendar. Collins chronicles
thefts, robberies, and executions in such profusion and in such variety
as never happened in any other civilized community of such slender pro-
portions, but with all this superabundance of materials he is without the
facultv of turning it to effective account. This deficiency—if it be one
is fully compensated for in Barrington’s History , where the same ground
is covered but now with a master’s touch, and Barrington’s style has a
further advantage. It is that of a man endowed with just that dullness
to wit which is provocative of wit in others and so the History is amusing
when Collins’ Account is simply dull.
For sheer daring in the cultivation of literature the publication of the
Memoirs of James Hardy Vaux is without a parallel. Convicted in Eng-
land for stealing “ diamond rings etc. privately in a shop,” he was what was
known in the colony as a “lifer,” but he obtained a conditional pardon
which insured him absolute freedom so long as he kept aloof from fresh
crime and remained in the colony. But Australia presented no field for
his handicraft, which was that of a professional pickpocket, and had no
attractions for him, and he managed to escape to England though in so


doing he rendered himself liable to retransportation for life. With this
knowledge any ordinary man would have tried to keep himself as much as
possible out of the public gaze and to destroy his identity. Not so James
Hardy Yaux, who went to press with his Memoirs in two duodecimo
volumes, London, 1819. The work was printed by W. Clowes, but instead
of a publisher’s name there is the announcement that it is “ Sold by all
respectable booksellers.” How it was introduced into the channels of the
book trade I cannot think, but no doubt both the Memoirs itself and the
Thieves Dictionary which is appended to it would be attractive enough to
the buyers of this special class of literature. For us the interest in the
book is in the descriptions of the relations which existed between the
early settlers and their assigned men. It is cleverly written but all
through it you can see that Hardy Yaux hadpronounced criminal proclivities
and to say that there was a moral warp in him is to say but little—in one
human soul he combined the Artful Dodger and Job Trotter. The
Memoirs is a scarce book—for years past the Public Library has had the
second volume only—and with its publication our interest in its author
ceases, but his subsequent conviction in Dublin under the name of James
Stewart, his re-transportation to New South Wales and his long career in
crime there are all told by Therry.
In 1838 T. Crofton Croker edited and Bentley published the Memoirs of
Joseph Holt , General of the Irish Rebels in 1798, which was introduced by
the following verse from an Irish ballad on its title page :—-
“ All have heard sure of Vinegar Hill,
Likewise of the Battle of Tara ;
Of General Holt and his men,
With their guns they call tanta ra-ra-ra.’ :
About half of these posthumous memoirs is devoted to the rising in
Wicklow in which Holt took an important part, the other half to his ex-
periences during his stay in New South Wales (to which he was banished
for life) and Norfolk Island. Barrington and Yaux were convicted
thieves; against Holt there was no charge save that of being a rebel, who
surrendering on the implied condition that his life should be spared, was
simply banished. Though as he himself said an almost uneducated man,
he was brave, intelligent, and with quick powers of observation. His
editor was afraid that he was a little prone to what Anthony Trollope
told us was our own characteristic failing, but looking at the book and
what we know to have been the surroundings of the man, I do not doubt
but that Holt was just such a man as he represents himself to have been.
Though the rebellion of ’9B was not a matter of religion but of country —
the Protestants being just as much concerned in its inception as the
Catholics —yet the great majority of the 13,000 men who placed Holt in
the position of their Commander-in-chief were members of the latter per-
suasion, while he, as he is careful to explain, “ had been brought up in
the Protestant religion and always professed it.” Intrinsically I daresay
the history of the outbreak is the more valuable, but ous the period from
Holt’s arrival in Sydney in the “Minerva,” on 11th January, 1800, until
his departure (after he had received a free pardon) :■ i 12th December,
1812, is the more important. Hardy Yaux’s strictu; ~j on the treatment


the prisoners received from some of the settlers to whom they were assigned
were pronounced enough, but he would be likely to have one-sided views
on such a question. Holt on the other hand was a disinterested spectator
and this is what he says ;—“ One man Maurice Fitzgerald was sentenced
to receive three hundred lashes and the method of punishment was such
as to make it most effectual. The unfortunate man had his arms extended
round a tree, his two wrists tied with cords and his breast pressed closely
to the tree so that flinching from the blow was out of the question. * *
Two men were appointed to flog, namely Richard Rice, a left-handed man
and John .Johnson, the hangman from Sydney, who was right-handed.
They stood on each side of Fitzgerald and I never saw threshers in a barn
move their flails with more regularity than these two man-killers did,
unmoved by pity and rather enjoying their horrid employment than other-
wise.” The Government required that a doctor should be present when
more than fifty lashes were administered, and on this occasion Dr. Mason
represented the faculty and despite his vocation he is a greater monster
than either the Sydney hangman or the “ left-handed man ” whom he
encouraged with a smile, and by telling them that the man would tire
them both before he failed. The next prisoner who was tied up was
Paddy Galvin, a lad of about twenty years of age, who also received three
hundred lashes. The horrible details are in Holt’s book, but I spare you
them. Do you wonder at Holt saying much later down in his book “It
“ would have been far more merciful in those days to have hanged all who
“ violated the laws of their country, than to have sent them to New South
“ Wales and its dependencies, subject to the unmerciful treatment of human
“ tigers. * * * I saw many a fine man die in misery inch
“by inch from the oppression he experienced.”
Having commenced the notice of the Botany Bay Calendar literature
with the work of one Judge—David Collins—l will close it with that of
another, Roger Therry, whose Reminiscences of Thirty Years Residence in
New South, Wales was published in 1863, and went, with however several
careful omissions, to a second edition in the same year. Therry arrived in
the colony in 1829, and during the latter part of Lieutenant General
Darling’s administation and the whole of that of Sir Richard Bourke, he
was intimately identified with one of the two factions, which were bit-
terly opposed to one another on the question of penal discipline and the
conferring of social and political rights upon the emancipists. An active
partisan and a splendid hater Therry had in turn probably a larger
number of personal enemies than any other man in the colony. He had,
in consequence, a splendid field to cover : old grudges required to be satis-
fied ; defeats avenged ; and personal enemies impaled. /nd he was care-
ful, for before he went to press In' was far away from the scenes he depicts ;
he, himself, was an old man, and his enemies were dead and unable to
reply and so he has them brought out of their coffins for his final judgment.
This may seem not lo have been quite fair but we are dealing with books and
Therry’s is an exceedingly clever one, written too with a brilliancy and
style which are not surpassed in the whole range of our Australian litera-
ture. As prosecutor, defender, or judge he had unusual advantages for
gathering together the criminal records of his day, and when the party
factions of Sir R. Bourke’s administration are forgotten, the stories of
John Tawell, Luke Dillon, Mais and Fitzgibbon, Bushell “'the knave of


diamonds,” and many such others, as Therry tells them, will form studies
for the sensation novelists of future generations. The incidents seem to
stand out in bold relief on his page. You can feel the momentarily in-
creasing interest in the development of the evidence in the cases of Shea
for the murder of his partner, Menzies, and of Purcell for the murder of
Palfrey, culminating in the former case by the finding of a single and in
the latter several hairs of the victims in the eyes of their murderers’ toma-
hawks; again you follow on the trail of the white men who treacherously
and indiscriminately murdered a whole tribe of blacks at Myall Creek ;
you learn how “cattle-stealing was reduced to a science and your child-
ren’s children will again hear the noise “like that of breaking a cocoa-nut
with a hammer,” caused by Knatchbull breaking the skull of his victim,
Mrs Jamison. Talk of fiction ! the mind of man never conceived atrocities
so fanciful, grotesque, or horrible as those which form stern realities in the
history of the white settlement in Australia.
There is one other subject of which our Australian books are the sole
repositories:—-The history, manners, customs, laws, and religion of our
blacks—the Australs—the oldest pure race of the human family inhabiting
any portion of the earth. Living here since at least the dawn of the
stone age—not of Europe, but of Asia—or before man ever committed a
grain of seed to the ground or garnered more than was necessary for the
consumption of a single day. You can read in and between the lines of
the historians from Dam pier to Sir George Grey how this race of hunters
evolved out of their moral consciousness a series of laws which for the wants
of the race and to accord with their surroundings are as precise and as perfect
as any ever made by Athenian law-givers or modern parliaments. We talk,
or at least our fathers did, of the freedom of savage life, but here were a
people whom Dampier does not hesitate to call savages, as Cook called
them Indians, and who were long supposed to be at about the foot of the
intellectual ladder, environed, as with a band of iron, with complex laws
relating to descent, marriage, the rights in property, the distribution of
food, and those which in our social systems are controlled by boards of
health. In them you can read anew the history of man’s existence and
of the daily struggle upon which that at best depends; tracing the
evolution of society from that of an unsegregated to a segmented state
and thence through the totemic to the communal divisions in which they
existed, as they had done for long ages before, at the time of the English
settlement. Based on two great fundamental principles : —That the num-
ber of the population should not exceed the supply of food that the con-
tinent furnished, and that there should be a sufficient number of people to
capture the game which formed the great staple of that food, they are also
laid down on principles of intense communism, and if it be that history
but repeats itself in ever recurring waves, the communists of the future
may have to refer to them for what may be wanting in furtherance of their
views in the laws of the Athenians, the Romans, the Code Napoleon or the
British Consolidated Statutes. The Austral tongue, though its structure
remained unchanged was broken up from causes which we partly know in-
to dialects peculiar to each commune, and often unintelligible to families
at a short distance beyond its confines, but with all this change of dialect
the laws, unwritten though they were, were held in sacred observance from
Shark’s Bay to Break-sea Spit, and from Cape York to Cape Otway, as if


—and this was so—the very existence of the race depended on their rig-
orous observance. And their religion, simple although it was, has its tale
to tell in religious evolution—two definite dogmas at least run hand in
hand with ours—the existence of a Creator and the immortality of the soul.
Of their social science, or their striving after purity as they understood
it, or their social customs which form a romance of human existence,
this is not the time or place to speak. Only this by way of caution, we
must be careful how we read. Modern gleaners have unfortunately writ-
ten descriptions of corroberies, and even of the “ Boras ” as performed by
the inmates and even natives of mission stations and Government farms ;
have gathered from the same unreliable sources laws tinctured with those
current among us as to rights in property, marriage, and even with a
European system of descent; and have found the simple religion tinctured
with Paulinism. The entire autonomy of the race was destroyed by the
English settlement and by the small-pox, which breaking out in 1789
ceased not until it had devastated the continent, and what the blacks have
now to tell is neither Austral nor European, but a strange blending and
travestie of both. As soon expect to get an insight into the principles
of feudalism, and the manners and customs current in England under the
early Tudors, from the unlettered inmates of English workhouses as ex-
pect to reach the spirit of the Austral race-through their wretched de-
scendants living to-day or within the last half century in Australia.
Of the names on the long roll of historians from David Collins to David
Blair it would be impossible to speak in a paper which is but an introduction
to Australian bibliography, but the incidents which these writers relate, and
which those who come after them can also tell of our early days which
will be of abiding interest, are those of our old books. Bass and Flinders
exploring for days and nights the eastern coast in the “ Tom Thumb”, an
open boat of eight feet long, and cramped and numb from exposure and
cold, finding when they could effect a landing, the “ beach to them as a
bed of down”; Bass trying to find a passage over the Blue Mountains by
the valley of the Grose and climbing the sides of the gorges with iron
hooks on his hands and feet; Sturt hemmed in for months in the Stony
Dessert under a blistering sun with no alternative but to “ sit down at his
“ post determined to abide the result, to trust to the goodness of Providence
“ to release him from prison when He thought best”; Hume converting his
dray by means of a tarpaulin into a boat by which be brought his party
and* their effects across the Murray ; Eyre below the cliffs of the Great
Australian Bight threatened with a water famine and with his life in
hourly peril from his treacherous blacks ; Kennedy fatally wounded by
the blacks, dying in the arms of the faithful Jackey Jackey ; Leichhardt
returning from his overland expedition to Port Essington—he was supposed
to have perished—as one “ come back from the grave” and then setting out
on a final exploration in the unknown bush from which neither he nor any
of his followers ever returned ; and Burke, Wills and King having crossed
the continent arriving half famished at the just deserted depot with for sign
the word “Dig”, but some one had blundered and death (at least for two
of them) had to be faced as best it might. These and many such incidents
are the real leading lines in our history and when those which mark our
political progress, at best but partial expressions of ever restless, ever
shifting public opinion, are lost sight of in still higher developments, these


men and others such as they will recount for ever and for ever the stages in
the discovery of a new continent and the infant struggles of a mighty
empire that shall be.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA.
APPENDIX.
GEORGE BARRINGTON.
Though much of the interest which once surrounded the name of George
Barrington has passed away, its connection with several works in reference
to the early days of the settlement in New South Wales will necessarily
give it some abiding importance in the history of Australia and in Aus-
tralian literature. The incidents in his British career have been exhaus-
tively dealt with by his earlier biographers, while those of his Colonial one
are scanty, uneventful, and though not without interest—with interest of a
widely different kind to that which created purchasers for the biographies
of him published during his lifetime. Nor is this to be wondered at. In
England he had achieved for the theretofore mean offence of pocket-picking
nearly such a romance as Claud Duval had for highway robbery. In
Australia, as a prisoner of the Crown, or as a humble officer under it, and
with an altered will, his life was just as prosaic as it had formerly been
romantic.
Historians and biographers in borrowing from their predecessors have a
fatal predeliction for trying to give increased emphasis to what had been
previously written ; whether the fact by such treatment became more
clear, or was reduced to an absurdity, or if the statement became mis-
leading, or even false, appears often to have been thought immaterial so
long as a telling sentence or paragraph was produced. To this apparently
inexorable law of literary handicraft the scanty incidents of Barrington’s
colonial career are no exception. In many of our histories there is a
paragraph to the effect that he was one of the first convicts to whom a
warrant of emancipation was given. The statement is inexact, though not
absolutely untrue, but in his latest biography—that by Thompson Cooper,
F.S.A., in the Dictionary of National Biography —we are told that “he
obtained in 1792 the first warrant of emancipation ever issued,” which is


more forcible and picturesque than in the earlier form, but is unfortunately
untrue.
Barrington came out in one of the transports of the “ second fleet,”
though whether in the Active, which arrived on the 26th September, 1791,
or in the Albemarle, on the 13th October is less certain. The latter ship
is the one mentioned in Barrington's Voyage where, too, its reputed author
credits himself with having been the principal means of stamping out the
mutiny which broke out shortly after leaving England. (Of there having
been a mutiny on board, and that two of the ring-leaders were hanged at
the fore yard-arm, there is no doubt, but of Barrington’s part in its being
put down there is less certainty.) Collins, who had opportunity for
obtaining correct information, says that Barrington was sent out in the
Active and the paragraph in his Account of the English colony in New South
Wales, in which the statement is made, is copied, unaltered, within
inverted commas, and without protest as to the name of the ship, in the
History of New South Wales, which professes to have been written by
Barrington himself. As to whether the ship was the Active or the
Albemarle is of less value as an abstract fact than in its relation to the
authorship of the Barrington literature. On his arrival he was £ ,placed
by the Governor in si situation at Toongabbe, which was likely to attract
the envy and hatred of theconvictsiu proportion as he might be vigilant and
inflexible. He was first placed as a subordinate, and shortly after as a prin-
cipal watchman; in which situation he was diligent, sober and impartial; and
had rendered himself so eminently serviceable, that the Governor resolved
to draw him from the line of convicts; and with the instrument of his
emancipation, he received a grant of thirty acres of land. He was after-
wards sworn in as a peace officer.”
The commission under the great seal empowering the Governor for the
the time being to remit either absolutely or conditionally, the whole or
any part of the term for which felons or other offenders should have been
or might thereafter be transported was received by His Majesty’s ship
Gorgon, which arrived on the 21st September, 1791. Towards the end of
July of the following year a warrant of emancipation was issued under
this power, in favor of a female prisoner, and Collins in writing about this
says;—“This power so pleasing to the feelings of its possessor, had
hitherto been very sparingly exercised.” It was not until tne 3rd of No-
vember of that year (T 792) that the warrant in favor of George Barrington
passed, with two others, the seal of the colony.
Joseph Holt went to Parramatta on the 19th of January, 1800. “On
the day after,” be says, “ I walked about the town. I saw several persons
from Dublin, of whom I had some knowledge, and also my countryman,
the most celebrated of pick pockets, George Barrington. He was walking
arm in arm with Thomas Atkins, Esq. (evidently Bichard Atkins after-
wards Judge Advocate.) I wished to have some conversation with them,
and I think they desired to talk with me. Mr Atkins asked me into his
house, and Barrington followed. A bottle of rum was produced, and some
pleasant conversation about Ireland passed. At length I wished to retire,
but Mr Atkins said he never allowed any bottle off his table till he saw it
emptied. We finished the half gallon bottle, and were of course not a little
elevated, being each of us as full of chatter as a hen magpie in May.”
Memoirs of Joseph Holt. —Yol. 11, p.p, 77-8.


Holt in relating his business transactions says;—“l then (1801) pur-
chased Barrington’s farm, of twenty-five acres, an old brood mare with a
colt at her foot for <£loo, and sold the mare in four days after for £B5.
Whether this was the thirty acre farm, or part of it, or some other pro-
perty, only a search in the Sydney Titles’ office would be likely to disclose,
but even though Holt was anxious to show his keen business proclivities,
the land is not likely to have been of much value when twenty-five acres
and a colt only stand their purchaser in £l5. Once more—in 1803—
Holt mentions Barrington’s name, but this time the reference is merely
incidental. “I went to the house of John Jennett, who had succeeded
Barrington, the pick-pocket, in the office of chiet-constable. "—Memoirs,
vol. 11, p. 184.
After the date of the purchase by Holt of the farm, the interest in
Barrington, as he certainly wished it should, was evidently dying out.
So, too, was the man himself, but, as will be seen from the following
extract from Mann’s Picture of Australia, the end was not reached without
dark shadows. ‘‘ Mr George Barrington during his residence in the colony,
conducted himself with singular propriety of conduct, and by his industry
had saved some money; but for a considerable time previous to his
death he was in a state of insanity, and was constantly attended by a trusty
person. The general opinion of those around him was, that he brought on
this malady, so destructive to the majesty of man, by his serious and sorrow-
ful reflections on his former career of iniquity. He expressed a very con-
siderable degree of displeasure, when he was in a state of sanity, at his
name being affixed to a narrative, which he knew only by report, as being
about to be published, and which subsequently did appear under a decep-
tions name.”
And at the age of fifty-five peace came to the weary and shadow-
darkened soul, and all that was mortal of George Barrington, the versatile
and romantic pick-pocket, the brilliant apologist, the “ diligent, sober
and impartial” territorial peace officer, and the gentlemanly old man long-
remembered by the early inhabitants of Parramatta as “ scrupulously neat
in dress, and courteous in deportment ” found rest in the burial ground of
St. John’s church there on December 29th, 1804.


f The following curious prologue was spoken at the theatre which is cer
tainly particularly descriptive of the theatrical corps.
PROLOGUE.
From distant climes o’er wide-spread seas we come, /
Though not with much “ eclat” or beat of drum ; > a .< s \
True patriots all, for, be it understood U ( ; L
We left our country for our country's good ;
No private views disgrac’d our generous zeal, r . A/ <0
What urg’d our travels was our country’s weal ; f •( 4 J Q
And none will doubt, but that our emigration
Has proved most useful to the British nation.
But, you inquire, what could our breasts inflame, • j* i
.With this new passion for theatric fame ;
What in the practice of our former days,
Could shape our talents to exhibit plays ?
Your patience, sirs, some observations made,
You’ll grant us equal to the scenic trade.
He, who to midnight ladders is no stranger,
You’ll own will make an admirable Ranger.
To seek Macheath we have not far to roam,
And sure in Filch I shall be quite at home.
Unrivalled there, none will dispute my claim
To high pre-eminence and exalted fame.
As oft on Gadshill we have ta’en our stand,
When ’twas so dark you could not see your hand,
Some true-bred Falstaff we may hope to start,
Who, when well-bolster’d, well will play his part.
The scene to vary, we shall try in time
To treat you with a little pantomime.
Here light and easy Columbines are found,
And well-tried Harlequins with us abound ;
From durance vile our precious selves to keep,
We often had recourse to th’ flying leap ;
To a black face have sometimes ow’d escape,
Aud Hounslow Heath has proved the worth of crape.
But how, you ask, can we e’er hope to soar
Above these scenes, and rise to tragic lore ?
Too oft, alas ! we've forced the unwilling tear,
And petrified the heart with real fear.
Macbeth, a harvest of applause will reap,
For some of us, I fear, have murdered sleep ;
His lady too with grace will sleep and talk,
Our females have been us’d at night to walk. A
Sometimes, indeed, so various is our art,
An actor may improve and mend his part;
“ Give me a horse,” bawds Richard, like a drone,
We’ll find a man would help himself to one.
Grant us your favour, put us to the test,
To gain your smiles wpfl do our very best ;
And without dread 01 future Turnkey Lcckits,
Thus, in an honest way, still pick your pockets.
