The Pacific Emp ire
CHAPTER I.
The First Record
The impartial judge the book of fate shall scan,
The unerring records of the deeds of man.
—Goronwy Owain.
WEALTHY man of renown was one day seated in his
parlour. He was engaged in meditation, and thought
of his name. He wondered where it originated and
what it meant. He had an idea his ancestors came from
Scotland; so then he sent experts with a commission to
gather up all the information they could, and return.
The whole of Scotland was searched, and every Parish
Register was examined, and every likely cupboard was turned out. The
result of the investigations was taken to the millionaire. From which
it was proved that the name “Clow” originated in Perthshire, Scotland.
It is not an old name—it goes back to the year 1640; but no further.
It is mentioned in Burke’s Heraldry and signifies: In distress we are
entwined till death.
The Presbyterian Church existed before the origin of the word “Clow”;
hut it would be about the year it came to be definitely organised in
the form we now know it.
The result of the search proved highly satisfactory to the gentleman
who had defrayed the cost of it, and he briefly circularised the Clow-
Clan throughout the world with the particulars. So far, however, from
ending the enquiry it struck a poorer man bearing the name that if it
originated in the Seventeenth Century then the family who adopted
it must have existed previously under another name. Whence the
change and why? It was then discovered that the family who adopted
this name were not Scotch, but were of Flemish origin. In their own
country they existed under the name of “Clutch.” Under this name
they can be traced back to the days of John Calvin. They adopted
his teaching, and beyond the days of Calvin their history is lost. The
search revealed that this family belonged to the struggling, or poorer
section of humanity. They tilled the ground and would grind a little
corn—bake it in a little oven on their own premises, and then hawk
it in a basket on their arm, and sell it for a living.
In tracing family matters things meet our attention that any man
may study with profit. Though I have not read it in books; nor have
I ever met a man who raised the question; yet sitting alone in study
it has occurred to me. Does all the knowledge that a man acquires
in life perish? Certainly all the productions of his knowledge do.
An educated man dies. So much of his learning as he reduces to
writing remains. Is the rest lost? A photo, is produced by a flash
of light, and the impression is preserved, and may be produced again
and again as required. A purely mechanical contrivance like the
phonograph will hold the human voice, and repeat it when desired.
Flesh and blood will reproduce its similar in mould and features; then
may not nervous matter and emotional sense receive an impression
and pass it down to the second or third generation to be brought

into e\idence when opportunity conies. As we proceed with this
story we will at least keep this thought in mind; it may help to
explain a seeming inherent yearning for the noble in life, and the
beautiful in art which we might find difficulty in explaining the
origin of.
. I _ only know the Flemish cities as I have read of them in history, and
it is only a view of them during the Spanish Inquisition that con-
cerns this narrative. Speaking of the Antwerp of those days Emile
Cammaerts says:—
The Cathedral was begun before the crisis. So indeed was the
Hotel de Ville finished in 1561, which we find a few steps further
facing the Grand Place. But almost every monument which attracts
the visitor was built during the decadence. The powerful person-
ality of Rubens appears everywhere. In the Cathedral with the
celebrated “Descent from the Cross.” In the Royal Museum with
the no less striking “Spear Thrust.” In the churches such as that
ot S. Carlo Borromeo—which he is supposed to have designed. In
the Rue Rubens in the house he spent most of his life. In the
chapel which bears his name. In the choir of S. Jacques—where he
is buried with his family. If ever a man typified his country and
his time that man was Rubens —painter and diplomatist— great
propagandist of the Counter-Reformation so actively promoted by
the Jesuits, who, with his help, were laying the foundations of
modern Belgian Catholicism.
The reaction against the sober and stern Calvinism which pre-
vailed in Flanders for a short time is everywhere plainly apparent
in every feature of social life. It is felt throughout the fine
seventeenth century mansion which has been preserved in the
Platin Museum. Though a master painter Christopher Platin was
well looked upon by the Spanish governors, and obtained in 1570
the monopoly of printing liturgical books. The house itself was
partly built in the sixteenth century, but most of the furniture and
pictures belong to the Counter-Reformation.
Study the churches of the times, and it can be seen there everything
that was calculated to impress the human mind —the vision of which
w'as nearly sufficient to survive the natural death of the beholder. It
must have been truly a marvellous place. Cathedrals with beautiful
ornamental spires. The rococo churches over done with ornamenta-
tion and costly facades, adorned in the interior with carvings of
exquisite design, and with the sacred pictures of Rubens.
In the year 1760 James Fitzjames Clow migrated from Perthshire,
Scotland, to the United States. His son was James Beach Clow—he
was the father of Samuel Clow. His boy, who bore the name of his
grandfather, established the firm of James Beach Clow and Sons,
Chicago. Ihey established iron and steel works, and became renowned
workers in metal of all classes. Ihey had marble and slate works
in various places, and they have to this day foundries, offices, work-
shops. and showrooms in all the great cities of the United States. They
reproduced the great arts of Antwerp in America, and in many things
exceeded the Flemish craftsman as moulders and finishers —possibly
impressions of their ancestors produced the result. Though I have
placed this information where it has its proper bearing on this history,
its mention is advancing our story a little ahead of the time with
which we are dealing, so we will go back again.
Though a genius as a painter, Rubens was a wretch as a politician.
If the real character of the man was well known, nothing he ever
did would be appreciated outside Latin countries. He was an in-
tolerant, narrow-minded, bigoted fiend. He was a one-sided man even
in art. He, however, never did things by halves, Rubens added
a most exterminating zeal to the persecution of the Calvinists. Many
of the family of whom we are speaking, fell under it, but a remnant
escaped to Scotland, and I think they changed the family name so
that they could not be traced. At one time I thought the word “Clow”
was meaningless, and I accidentally gave this opinion to some Welsh


scholars. They, however, told me that it was of Celtic origin and
that it means “fastened” From this it can be seen how the word
“Clutch” suggested it. , After the family became established m
Perthshire, wherever a strong man of the name Clow lived, a Hour mill
and a Presbyterian Church would most likely be near by.
Mother was a Calvinist, and in the year 1861 she met William
Clow. Mother enquired of someone else who he was, and she was
informed that he was a nephew of the Rev. James Clow. When mother
met him again she asked him if this was correct, and he said it was, and
that his father’s name was Peter, and that his father and James Clow
were brothers. . ..
Now, this was purely oral information —it was never printed until
I issued it in 1921. Thus for a hundred years it was just oral tradi-
tion, but the circulation of my book in Scotland brought to light his
grandfather’s Bible which verified my printed statement. I mention
this at the outset because if one statement that William Clow made can
be verified after a hundred years, much else that he said might one
day be proven. .
James Clow, of Braco, was twice married. His Bible is now in pos-
session of Isabella Patterson, Brunbank, Blair Drummond, Stirling,
Perthshire, Scotland. The entry in it is as follows:
James Clow, Fedale, his Holy Bible.
Peter, lawful son of James Clow and Margaret Keir, born
’2O Sep., 1785.
James, lawful son of James Clow and Helen Gray, born
26 May, 1790.


CHAPTER 11.
Feddal House.
One would like to know all about Feddal, for the places that mould
the saints are supremely holy places.
—An Unknown Writer in the “Irish Presbyterian.”
UCH Australian interest gathers around the Feddal Home.
It is but little I know of it, hut what I do know I will
relate. The word “Feddal” has been spelt in different
ways, but I think the pronunciation has been ever the
same. The writer quoted above asks:
Had the hills about the little village a stern yet
kindly face? Did its streams make softer music, and
the sun love its dells with unashamed partiality? Did
“The pure mist—the pity of the sea
Come as a soft white hand
And tenderly caress its face?”
We’ll never know. We only know the great God, Who determines
the bounds of our habitation, that we may seek after and tind
Him, appointed Feddal as the earthly home and dwelling-place of
the generations of godly men and women —the progenitors of
William Clow.
James Clow learnt the occupation of his father. He was born in
the year 1755. He was a farmer and miller and dwelt in the Feddal
home. His flour mill was driven by water power. He was first married
to Margaret Keir, by whom he had one son, and they called him Peter.
Margaret Keir died, and he then married Helen Gray. Her family, I
think, belonged to St. Nimins, Stirling. By his second wife he had
one son, and they called him James —this is the boy whose history is
associated with Bombay and Australia. Now this is all that is known,
and I was very lucky to discover this much, and had my research work
been delayed hut a little longer, the identity of the Indian missionary
and the Melbourne evangelist with this Scotch home, could never have
been established. But as I have related this it corresponds with the
testimony of William Clow —the statement in the office of the Mel-
bourne Statist and the family Bible now in possession of Isabella
Patterson.
James Clow was born with only one hand. I know nothing more
of his early career than William Clow told mother, which was to
the effect that it became evident that if James would ever accomplish
anything for himself, it must be by way of education. Ido not know
the measure or extent of his education, but I know it involved a big
sacrifice upon his brother Peter. It was put to me by one who was
competent to know, that Peter “toiled hard” that his less fortunate
brother might receive a special education, and any success that James
gained in life it becomes us to give a little of the honour to Peter.
If we decide to do this, it will solve some matters in this story which
cannot be otherwise explained.
I can put no hymns, prayers, or Scripture readings into this chapter
for there is nothing survived. I could easily manufacture a few and
pass them off as authentic, but where there is no record I mean to he
silent. It is reasonable, however, to suppose that the father in this
household was highly respected, and had gained a high standing—per-
haps an Eldership in the Church. For something happened just here
that is very striking.


•Jm—mi— m»—i


A dispatch was sent to the Governments of Bombay, Bengal, and
Madras by the Directors of the East India Company which was dated
12th November, 1813. This is called “The Charter of the Church of
Scotland in India.” It reads:—
In order to shew our desire to encourage by every prudent means
in our power the extension of the principles of the Christian Re-
ligion in India, we have unanimously resolved that an addition
be made to the present clerical establishment maintained by the
Company at each of our principal settlements of Bengal, Madras,
and Bombay for those ministers of the Church of Scotland as we
may permit to proceed to India to act as Chaplains at either of
these places.
The original is in the records of the Bombay Government, and is
signed “Your loving friends” the Directors. Now, remembering that
the transit of mail between India and England often occupied five
months in those days, the Church in Scotland made a very quick re-
sponse, for by a Deliverance dated 14th May, 1814: —
The General Assembly of the Church in Scotland recognized the
Chaplains who should be appointed as in full union, and connection
with the Church of Scotland: They must conform to the worship
now practised in the Church of Scotland: They are empowered to
ordain Elders and to hold Session for the exercise of discipline
according to the rules of the Church and the management of the
Ecclesiastical affairs of the Congregation.
There are only two ways by which a man can be appointed to an
important position. It must be by sheer force of his personal ability,
or by influence. If the younger James gained his appointment by
influence we must conclude that the elder James had a very high stand-
ing in the Church. Perhaps, however, the younger James had dis-
tinguished himself by scholarship and ability, and by sheer force of
his own personality had commended himself to the important com-
mission. He was not the first missionary in India, for Carey had been
appointed to Fort William twenty years before that, hut so far as I
know, he was the first Presbyterian in the field. Indeed, it looks from
the Deliverance just cited as if his appointment had already been
assured, and that all that remained was for it to be ratified by the
East India Company. I paid to have a search made in the Company’s
Office, to which I received the following reply: —
India Office, London,
sth December, 1925.
R. J. Clow, Esq.
Sir, —In reply to your letter, 6th October, I am directed to inform
you the Reverend James Clow was appointed a Chaplain on the
Bombay Establishment on 21st November, 1814 (East India Com-
pany’s Court Minutes. 25th November, 1814), and arrived in Bombay
on Bth November, 1815.
I am, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
W. Outwith,
Superintendent of Records.
The following is a record in Bombay:—
The Rev. James Clow was appointed to Bombay by the Court of
Directors on Bth December, 1814. He submitted the terms of his
appointment, along with his letter of acceptance, to the Presbytery
of Kirkaldy, and was ordained accordingly. He arrived in Bombay
on Bth November, 1815.
This record, I think, would most likely be correct. The reason for the
difference given for the date of his appointment would be: The
Company would not deem it necessary to inform the Bombay Govern-
ment as to the date of his appointment. They would just be notified in
the Company’s General Letter, and Bombay would make the record from
the date on the Letter which would be written to them some time


after the appointment was confirmed. I will advance reasons later on
to show that his association with the Company began from 10th October,
1813. On 19th May, 1924, I wrote to A. G. Clow, 8.A., Barrister, Under
Secretary to the Government, Delhi. This man, by the way, is the
author of the famous Text Book authorized for the guidance of the
Courts in India on The Workmen’s Compensation Act. He learnt from
the keeper of the Records there that James Clow was a chaplain in
Bombay from 1816.
The Rev. Dr. Ogilvie (now dead) searched all the Records of the
Church of Scotland for me. They are stored in Edinburgh. As far as
the work in India is concerned they are of little value, and if we only
had them to depend on we would be in a poor way. They give it; “Rev.
Jas. Clow arrived in India Bth Nov., 1815 —ordained 4th Feb., 1816.”
These two records require a little explanation. The Delhi record
dates his beginning as chaplain when James Clow established the Ses-
sion. The Edinburgh account is simply the result of carelessness or
imperfect entry. The minister would not be sent out before he was
ordained. What happened on the 4th February, 1816, was on that day
James Clow ordained four Elders. Ordained did not mean licenced.
A licenced minister, as I understand it, means one authorised to cele-
brate marriages. No minister outside the Anglican Church was so
licenced in India before 27th April, 1819.
We will proceed with the Feddal home. It is very little information
we have, yet all there is I know. William Clow told mother that Janies
being given up for the ministry necessitated a big struggle, and caused
heavy responsibilities to fall upon his brother, Peter, and we can we
believe it. Still he bore it ungrudgingly, and for this very reason
he is worthy of mention in his brother’s biography. Indeed, without
Peter we could not have identified the family of James, for there is no
record or printed book that associates the two boys or mentions their
early home. Peter in the first place educated James, and Peter’s
descendants preserved his history.
The younger James would be twenty-three years old when he was
appointed to the ministry, and by the time he got away, the elder
James would be sixty. Records show that the Clow family are for
the most part delicate and short-lived. Although no doubt the appoint-
ment of James to a good position occasioned much rejoicing in the
little home at Feddal, yet his absence was severely felt by Peter. Per-
haps at times James had been of much assistance to him at the niill m
book-keeping and correspondence, and his companionship would fie
helpful, and being deprived of all this, he must have felt it. The mill-
ing trade is not conducive to longevity, and doubtless Peter saw a
change coming over his father, and I fancy he anticipated the result.
Early in 1817 I fancy Peter must have explained things by means of an
urgent letter to Janies. Perhaps this letter would be sent about April
or May. The meaning of it evidently was made clear by the writer,
and grasped by James in India. Although the latter had building
operations in hand that required his personal attention, he suddenly
flies back to Europe. There are three records of this which I know
have never been understood. I will here show the meaning after
they have lain dormant for over a hundred years.
The Company’s record (London) says:—
On 14th November, 1817, he quitted India on furlough to Europe.
The Edinburgh record; —
In October, 1817, Mr. Clow had to leave hurriedly for Europe in
ill-health.
The following is a note by John C. Matthew, and appears to have
puzzled scholars in India: —
The minutes from this time give no information of the progress
of the Church towards completion. In 1817 —just a year after the
work had been begun—Mr. Clow is obliged to leave hurriedly for
Europe in ill-health. The last minute signed by him is 12th
October, 1817.


I think it was because of ill-health he left for Europe so suddenly,
but I do not think it was his own ill-health. The elder James died
at Feddal, 3rd March, 1818. Now the point that naturally excites us
here is; If the younger James left India on the 14th November, would
he reach Feddal in time to see his father? He would hardly do it.
In those days the trip often occupied a sailing vessel six months and
over. He may have reached home in time to speak with his father,
but I think the chances are against it.
I only saw' one written statement about the elder James, and it is
very brief: —
Old James Clow was one of those men over whose pathway men
built an archway of love as they travelled on their way to
immortality.
The elder James was buried in the churchyard at Braco. Over which
a tombstone was erected and an inscription written upon it, which, I
think, must have been composed by the younger James, for it is strik-
ingly like his composition:—
Erected to the Memory of
JAMES CLOW, of Miln, of Feddal,
who died 3rd March, 1818.
As Husband, Parent, Friend, and Neighbour
He was Universally Loved and Esteemed,
and as such He Died most Justly Lamented.
The younger James could not have delayed long in the Old Country
for he sailed from London for India on 20th August, 1818. We will
pause here to remark, Did he ever see Scotland again? I am inclined
to think he did, but William Moffat Clow differs with me in that —of
which we will hear more later. We will, however, leave the history of
James for the present and follow out the story of Peter.
We are told, when Christ ascended up on high. He gave gifts unto
men. And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evan-
gelists, and some pastors, and teachers. One would think that the
place of their origin was a veritable museum —stored with the relics
of the saints. Or a magnificent art gallery, but Feddal was not so. It
was just a plain little home from which went forth men of renown.
Peter married Isabella Brydie, and his family Bible now in possession
of Isabella Patterson shows the following to be the names of his
children: —
Ann, born 31st July, 1818.
James Moncrieff, born 10th April, 1820.
William, born 13th February, 1822.
Margaret Morison, born 23rd June, 1826
Peter, born 21st December, 1828.
We will not stop to comment on any of these, as they will all find
their way into the narrative as I proceed. It is only necessary here
to mention that Isabella Patterson is the daughter of the lastnamed
Peter.
Now proceeding with the history of the elder Peter. He lived on
in the Feddal home and continued the flour mill. So little of him is
definitely known that the very little is most precious. The only litera-
ture relating to him that has survived consists of two brief letters that
were written to him by his son James. When he wrote these letters
James had left home, and was striking out for himself in the world.
The father sent his son a box of foodstuff which the son acknowledges
with much appreciation. From the other it would seem that James
had contemplated setting up in business, and he must have written
to ask his father if he could assist him to that end. To this Peter
must have replied that he could let ’him have fifty pounds. James
thanks his father for the offer in the letter preserved, but he tells his
father that £5O would be hardly sufficient for what he refpiired, and
adds that he will wait a little longer.


I believe there is something more that could be added about Peter, but
as his grandson, William Moffat Clow, differs from me in my conclusion,
I will set our respective views out in another place. I have given all
the undisputed testimony there is regarding the brother of the venerable
James Clow. We can do no more than leave the home now and go io
the graveyard nearby at Braco. There is a stone there with this in-
scription upon it: —
In memory of Peter Clow, who died 4th March, 1860. Aged 75
years. Also of his wife Isabella Brydie, who died 17th December,
1872. Aged 84 years.
James Moncrieff Clow went to Glasgow. There he married the daugh-
ter of Dr. Moffat. By her he had three sons. She was a very pious
Christian lady. It is said she was “Christ’s evangel to her b °y s - y
removed to Ireland in 1855, and there remained. Of her sons only one
is now alive —William Moffat Clow. He was born in 1852, and is there-
fore 74. He was designed hy his parents for the ministry, but it wa
found that he could not be spared from his fathers flour mill. Com-
menting on this, an Irish writer said:—
God has made William Moffat Clow a minister, an ordained and
honoured servant of God and of man. We were mgrates if we did
not love him in return, and did not tell him so One does not eel
inclined to make any sort of mental or moral inventory of such
a man. In force and power of intellect we would rank him among
the highest. In eloquence—if eloquence is the power to persuade
he has few equals. The clearness, conciseness, force, and earnest-
ness with which he advocates any scheme on which his heait is
set make his speeches a delight and overcome opposition.
This gentleman and I have been in correspondence for a great many
years and I sometimes feel ashamed at the way I have worried him o
get me information on many matters, which alas has seemingl y
He told me that the Feddal home had no doubt been done up a little
as it needed it, but with no considerable alteration at the time the
Soto, was taken, and that it would date back to his father’s grea
grandfather. He said it was about a mile from Braco, and the school
was the first building on the road from Feddal. I think Braco would be
about seven miles from Stirling.
A short time ago my friend thought he had struck a possible mine
of information. He heard there was an old clergyman m Braco who
remembered the Clows, and he also heard there was still in the dis-
trict a young chap of eighty summers named Brydie who remembered
his grandmother. So he set out from Ireland on purpose to see these
men, and wrote to me as follows:
I got nothing new from the old man or the minister. I did,
however, see the place from a new aspect, and spent a pleasant
hour with the new Laird who took pleasure in showing me around.
The new Laird is a Stuart of the Royal line, and has a large family
tree on which he can go right back for many hundred years. He
is of little interest compared with that with which he is associated,
and he is able to have P a good time through the liberality of his
wife who is one of the Clarks of the Paisley-rich thread family. The
Clow flour mill has disappeared, and the stream is now used to
generate electricity for the new residence. Part of the old house
is still in existence, and is used by the family as a store for garden
produce It has only a few—three or four—small bedrooms, and
two down-stair rooms. The Clow family house is still in use,
and one wonders how so many people were able to live in it at the
same time.
I saw the tombstone, and was greatly pleased to see its fine state
of preservation. The inscription is easily read. The graveyard is
in charge of the Parish Council and is well kept. (Date of letter,
10th December, 1926.)


Thus it can be seen that Feddal has now definitely passed into the
hands of the Stuart Dynasty, and the Clows, who occupied it .for nearly
200 years, will occupy it no more forever.
William Moffat Clow had a son named Malcolm. He visited Aus-
tralia about twenty years ago. He worked on a station in Central
Queensland, and while there composed a story which was published, and
is preserved in the Clow Library. He was a grand fellow, and possessed
a rare literary gift. Of his story I can here but give a brief extract or
two. In it Malcolm said he was six months on the station when he
composed the story; that the name of the station was Coondara, situate
in Central Queensland; that it formed a part of the almost boundless
plains of the Nortli Gregory division. Ido not know the place, but the
following may help to locate it. He speaks in the narrative of travell-
ing stock from Cooinda and Belle Vue. He mentions Yanuka as if it
were close by, and Winton as a town within striking distance. He
refers to Lower Eddingslie, and says his master’s name was Ryan, and
that he used to ride to Olio for the mail.
While in Australia Malcolm looked up friends who owed their descent
to Feddal, and he visited mother in Toolangi Forest, Victoria. On the
outbreak of the European War he joined a British Convoy of the French
Red Cross composed of voluntary workers to attend the sick and the
wounded. He died on the battlefield, and was buried with military
honours. The letters Malcolm wrote from Macedonia were published,
and are treasured in the Clow Library. The following is an extract
from one of them:—
And so it was in the morning our ambulances were full, two fine
big men were carried out to me. One with his right arm clean off;
the second with his left completely gone. I could not take them
both because on the rough road the two stumps would touch, so
one was given to Brown, and instead I carried a man who had lost
his eye, the blood still all over his face. Mitch had a poor soul who
had had his leg off high up, and also a man with a shattered back.
Oh! you’ve only to see these men daily and to visit the battlefields
where every square yard almost tells its tale by cartridge, shrapnel,
and bomb, and where even now after months, are lying around the
dead bodies of brave men who did not seek to ask for war. On their
faces with eyes gone, and skin shrivelled up, is still discernible the
look of agony and pain as they cried out in terror until death in-
tervened, and behind that the tragedy of those who loved them; who
watched and waited and hoped on when they read the word “Missing.”
James Wightman composed a poem on the death of Malcolm. A por-
tion of it runs:
Lo, from his grave
A message rings like angel call from heaven:
Only in suffering shall ye find your souls.
Love, Courage, Hope are but the triple cord
That binds us to our duty and to God.


CHAPTER HI
The Word Came from Asia
In speaking of him as a chosen vessel, I know I am approaching a
mysterious subject; a subject that none of us would ever have known
had not the Great God revealed it by the work of his hands.
—E. Morgan, M.A., in his Biography of Jon Elias.
E will now make a fresh start with the history of the
venerable James Clow. In the Parish Register of Unthil,
Perthshire, Scotland, there is an independent record ot
the birth of our subject. It reads: —
James Clow, lawful son of James Clow and Helen
Gray, was born at Chester Hall, Parish of St. Nimins,
26th May, 1790.
This place is only a few miles from Braco, and the recording officer
recorded the nearest public landmark to the location of his birth. Chester
Hall was the name of the little school nearby, to which I have reterred,
where James was educated. I think the word should have been written
“Charters Hall.” There is another record in the office of the Govern-
ment Statist, Melbourne, to which I may refer later on.
The spiritual side of James Clow’s life has been entirely missed. All
the records concerning him were recorded by men who filled a secular
post, and we must feel grateful to them for their work, hut the literary
minds of the Presbyterian Church have been very slow that they did not
write a religious version of such a life that was spent in the service
Wine cI ICHgiuua VCIOIUU KJL -X
of the Church, long before now. But as I began life on the pick and
shovel, it seems appropriate that I should have the arduous task ot lay-
ing in the foundation of this story.
The Gospel began in Asia, and from Asia it came to Melbourne. Ihe
East India Company started the Church in Bombay and they established
the Presbyterian Church of Victoria.

Government House,
16th November, 1815.
This card marks the beginning of the Church in Bombay, and it was
published in the “Courier,” 18th November, 1815. The room at the
Barracks evidently did not suit him too well, for on 2nd December,
1815, the following notice appeared in the “Courier”:—
A CARD.
Divine Service according to the form of the
Church of Scotland, will be performed first Lord’s
Day, in the Court House, instead of the Mess-room
of the King’s Barracks, at 10 a.m.
JAMES CLOW.
Bombay,
27th November, 1815.


It seems from the records as if the first thing almost that Clow tried
to do was to establish the Lord’s Supper. He did not secure a result
as good as he expected. At the first celebration of the Holy Institution
there were twelve persons present, but he managed to increase it later
on. Clow issued little tokens. They were moulded and of a very simple
design—little square blocks. On the one side appears:
Church of Scotland, Bombay.
On the reverse:—
Let a man examine himself.—l Cor. xi. 28.
The communion set consisted of one salver for holding bread, two
cups, and one flagon for holding wine. On these were engraved a
wreath of Scotch thistles. This set, with the plate for the offering, are
still in use after a hundred years’ service.
The form of the General Service was as follows: —Ist, Psalms, Prayer,
Scripture Reading accompanied by short remarks, Prayer, Psalms, the
Sermon, Prayer, Psalms, and then the blessing. Each came in the
order in which I have stated it. There was only one service. Clow tried
to organize two services on the Lord’s Day, but the people dissuaded
him from it. They contended that if he held two services some could
only attend once a day—part would come in the morning and part in
the afternoon. Some of them lived as much as four miles off, and in
the oppressive heat they could only do the journey once. It would be
better to have hut one meeting and so get them all together. As far as
I can see, the single service on the Lord’s Day continued throughout
Clow’s ministry. The Pastor, however, had to do other ministerial work
besides what took place at the Church. He took the spiritual oversight
of the Army, but w'hat his services among them amounted to I am
unable to say. I think it only was to visit the soldiers in the Barracks,
and invite them to the meetings. In the Australian histories Clow is
frequently referred to as a “Chaplain of the troops in India.” I men-
tion this inaccuracy here because there are other things more im-
portant that are incorrectly stated in Victorian literature concerning
Clow to which I will refer later. This phrase, “Chaplain of the troops,”
is never once used in Edinburgh, Bombay, or the Company’s records.
Clow was a settled Pastor in Bombay. It is recorded of other ministers
following regiments, but it is never so recorded of Clow. He used to
visit the ships and invite the sailors to the meetings. In fact, it is
said that at almost every service two or three men holding the rank
of ship’s captain were present. But he also ministered to the spiritual
needs of all other classes of the community. A man with one hand
would not be appointed by the Government as Chaplain to the troops.
From anything I have been able to gather there is nothing to show
that Clow was an exceptional platform man, but the records leave no
room to doubt that he was a very acceptable preacher and a wonderful
pastor, for he always gathered good meetings. Interest grew and the
work extended. Many converts were made from the Hindoos. Two
Portuguese—Predo Luis and Manoel —were added to the Church, and
one convert was a “China Man” —written as I have written it.
The Church of Scotland, Bombay, was like unto a net cast into the sea
which gathered of every kind. Quite a number of doctors of medicine
were in the congregation, and a good number of Government officials, both
civic and military. Some of the helpers Clow trained for solemn con-
secration and ordained as Elders, came to be mighty men of renown.
Among these were Sir Charles Malcolm, Captain of the Royal Navy. He
afterwards became Rear-Admiral. While in Bombay he appreciated the
opportunity afforded him of assisting in the cause of Christ. He
regularly attended the Session meeting, and carried the Lord’s Supper
to the communicants at the worship meeting. When he finally left India
he was presented with a Bible by the Session “as a token of affection.”
Clow also ordained Major-General Sir William Grant Keir in 1819. The
first Elders of the Bombay Church were ordained 4th February, 1816.
Their names were: John Stewart, Hugh Stewart, William Erskine, and
Dr. Taylor.
There was also a petty staff connected with the Church. It consisted
of a Precentor, a Clerk, a Beadle, and two Humauls. The Precentor led


the singing. The Clerk was Church secretary. I am not too sure what
the duties of the Beadle were; I think it would be chiefly passing out
the hymn-books and showing strangers to their seats. The duties of
the Humaul I think would be to keep the Church clean, for which they
were paid four shillings and sixpence per month (I am translating In-
dian money to English terms). . .
I suppose, with an object of assisting people in distress the minister
might come across during his round of visitation, Clow took up a col-
lection for the poor at the close of the service every Sunday. I have
known of it being done once a quarter and once a month in different
parts of Australia, but this is the only instance I know of where a
collection for the poor was made every Sunday. This began on 11th
February, 1816, and it realized seven shillings. By the 31st March, how-
ever it rose to one pound twelve shillings and ten pence. During the
year’ 1824 the collections for the poor amounted to twenty-nine pounds
one shilling and seven pence. ... ,
Where a church is commenced in a great city, and everything has
to be done, the financial struggle is a hard one. It was so in Bombay.
The income of the Church was good, but the distress of India was great,
and there were so many calls to which, out of the goodness of their
heart, the Church responded freely. This left them in a position that
they could not meet their own liabilities, and they asked the Govern-
ment to assist them to discharge their obligations. The Government re-
plied that beyond building the Church and paying the evangelist s
stipend they could do no more—that whatever they wanted beyond that
the Church people would have to find the money themselves. Hie
Church then asked the Government if they might he allowed to collect
pew rent. The Government did not at first care to allow the seats to
be leased, but after further consideration they agreed to this. home
seats were kept free for strangers and for those who were unaEle to
pay. To assist the Church the Government paid four pounds per
month for seating accommodation for the soldiers. The rent for a
single seat was five shillings. The Church raised more by this means
than was expected, so they reduced the rents. The Government also
supplied the salary of the Session Clerk, who furnished the Govern-
ment with reports of the work done by the Church, and it is from those
reports that we are able to compile this history to-day.
When Presbyterian ministers became authorised to celebrate marriages
in India, Clow, according to the circumstances of the parties charged
them: —Gentlemen who were rich £3/7/6; middle class men £l/13/9; poor
men 6/9. It does not work out evenly in English money. A rupee is of
fluctuating value —I am regarding it as 2/3. There is no record as to
whether there was a charge for burials. Sometimes the Session Clei t
was also Precentor, and sometimes the Clerk also filled the duties of
Beadle. In the Church the Precentor had a little pulpit too. The
Clerk was very useful in cases of marriages or burials, for he made the
records and issued the certificates. The following would show the
form of the marriage certificate;—
I hereby certify that James Crawford, Corporal, 2nd European
Regiment, and Arabella Collins, widow, were married by in
the Scotch Church in the presence of William Cox, Sergeant, 2nd
Bombay European Regiment, and Mary Olherts, this tenth day
of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and
twenty-seven. JAMES CLOW.

Handwriting of James Clow reproduced by photograph.
There were two devotional services held in the Church at noonday
during the week, and religious services were also held at outposts by
the pastor, but I have no information regarding them. There was no
choir in the Church, but there were paid singers who helped in the
Gospel work. The first man to fill the office of Precentor was John
Mitchell. He continued from 11th February, 1816, to 1822. After this
the term of office was short. A very serious difficulty arose in con-
sequence. Some of the men who took the position were in the Army,
and were suddenly removed to another part of India. If the Precentor
were a very able man—as was sometimes the case—his sudden absence
was severely felt. To overcome this drawback Clow decided to in-
troduce an organ into the worship service. I cannot understand him
doing this, because up to this time, there was no instrumental music
in the Presbyterian Church. The organ was introduced into the
Church in Bombay and played for the first time 19th November, 1826,
and was played during Divine Service ever afterwards. It would seem
from this as if Clow was the first man to introduce instrumental music
into the Church of Scotland. In Scotland the first instrument used in
public worship was a harmonium which was introduced into Old Grey-
friars, Edinburgh, by Dr. Robert Lee in 1862.


Clow organized a library in connection with the Church. Clow
was appointed interim librarian, and he was asked to prepare a plan
and a catalogue for circulation. I won’t go right through this; but the
following will give an idea of what was there: —
Scott’s Bible, 6 vols.
Hervey’s Works, 4 vols.
Pike’s Consolations.
Baxter’s Call to the Uncoverted.
Baxter’s Dying Thoughts.
Drelincourt On Death.
Owen on the Spirit.
Boston’s Fourfold State.
Meikle’s Solitude Sweetened.
Drelincourt’s Antidote for the Miseries of Lite.
The title of the last one seems interesting. I don’t know what was
in it, hut there have been times in my life when, if I had had that book
by me I think I would have been inclined to give it a go. The cata-
logue is rather a long one, and though it may be interesting to some, it
appears to be very tough stuff. The last account of the library I have is
1916, and says:—
It still exists for the use of the members of the Church; hut the
entertainment it provides does not seem to suit the taste of the
present day.
To pick up the most important part of James Clow’s labours m
Rnmhav it is necessary to refer back again. As we have seen the

„ . vnoarit block of ground, situated between the Court House
men who appear to have had no special love for each other. 1 hen-
names were Hawkins and Goodfellow. They were both men of some
consequence. The plans of Hawkins, if carried out, would cost £5,400.
The other plans would cost £3,823. On the side of economy
fellow’s plans were accepted. The figures and discussion are very
mixed but it looks as if the building proposed was intended to hold
410 people —202 in the gallery and 208 in the basement and the woi
P X“ d oth October, 1816, the Session sent a letter to Sir Evan Nepean
the Governor, informing him of operations going on on their block
of land which they were told were the intended positions of the founda-
tions, to which they objected because they came too much on t
street the Governor wanted to know what right the Session had to put
their ’spoke in, and he sent for the Crown Advocate to enquire if the
Session had any legal standing. The Solicitor-General made answer
that he was not certain what a Session really was, but that he would
make enquiry. After he had done so he told His Excellency that he
thought a Session was something like Vestries. To add to_ the con-
fusion, Hawkins, whose plans had been rejected, commenced to look
round the building to see what he could discover with which to find
fault Hawkins filled the office of Superintendent of Roads and as
soon as he discovered that the steps projected on the footpath, he put


an injunction through the Court, and had the work stopped. The
Government, however, were not going to argue any points with him.
They sent a gentleman to inspect and report to them. The person sent
to inspect said the steps did truly project to the extent of 8 feet, but
the steps of the Court House right beside them stood 11 feet over on the
footpath. The Government rebuked Hawkins for an exhibition of
bad temper, which, they said, he had not displayed for the first time;
and to answer the Session the Government said they would treat with
Mr. Clow alone. Accordingly Clow was invited to superintend the
building operations, and this is his reply:—
_ I should feel myself in an uncomfortable and no very respectable
situation if placed in the position of superintending the progress
of an edifice the plan of which I do not approve.
When asked what there was in the plans to which he objected, Clow
said they did not provide for a steeple or a main door. The report
says:—
By a solecism, in architecture, perhaps unparalleled, the plan pre-
sented a Public Edifice with no main door, and without the possi-
bility of having one, two coupled pillars being right in the centre
of the building where the grand entrance might he.
The question of a Grand Door was altered to suit Clow’s idea, but
the question of a steeple was quite another matter. There seems to
be something very important about the steeple, although to this day
in Bombay they have not regarded it so. The difficulty about the
steeple, however, for the time being, was overcome by an agreement
being arrived at that the structure would be made substantial enough
to carry a steeple when its erection became a necessity. The work was
progressing rapidly, when on 14th November, 1817, Clow was hurriedly
called to Europe. 15th July, 1818, the Chief Engineer reported to the
Government that the Church was nearly finished, and a fence was
erected around it to protect the walls from injury. Thus by the 26th
September, 1818, the Presbyterian Temple, Bombay, was completed. Good-
fellow in the end performed his task in a manner that was pleasing to
all. It was reported upon as
A well executed example of ancient architecture, furnished in
the interior with great taste and neatness, and that it affords a
very respectable proof of professional judgment and attention.
With hut a few repairs this building, after a hundred years’ service,
remains as when it was built. It remained locked until Clow returned
from Europe. The total amount spent on the building proved to be
£4,589/8/8. This is a very large sum of money when we realize that
the wages of a mason or bricklayer would be only 2/- a day in those
times.
A trading boat called the Jemima, commanded by Captain M. Danby,
left London on 20th August, 1818, for India with James Clow on hoard.
On 25th November, 1818, the Bombay Gazette published the following:—
We are looking with some little anxiety for the Jemima, and think
she may be daily expected.
But it did not appear, so on 6th January, 1819, the Bombay Gazette tried
to soothe the uneasiness of friends in the following way:—
Where the Jemima has got to baffles all conjectures we can form.
The Brahmins, however, have been set to work, and next week we
hope to give some account of her.
They made no further reference to their joke about fortune-telling,
and still the Jemima did not appear. Not until the 10th of March did
it turn up. This gives a good idea as to the length of time a trip from
London to Bombay might occupy in those days.
On 12th March Clow announced to the Government that he had re-
turned. Now, two important things occupied Clow’s attention right
away. One was to be married, and the other to open the new Church.
He informed the Government that he resumed duties
Without prejudice to my rank.


The meaning of this would be that he reserved to himself the right
to plead for further concessions for the Church of Scotland in India
to give it the same standing and freedom that the Church of England
enjoyed. No doubt while in England he had discussed this with the
East India Company, and he had gained their sympathy and they gave
him his bearings how to act. The Anglican Bishop had claimed New
South Wales as part of the diocese of India. Clow was
in that, and the Bishop also objected to the ministers of the Church o
Scotland dispensing the Sacraments, and to them displaying any symbol
on their chapels that would give any of them the appearance ot an
Established Church. f
Clow wished to be married, so he had to go to the Church of England,
Bombay, for the ceremony, and the following paragraph appeared in
the Bombay Gazette 14th April, 1819:
On the 13th instant, at St. Thomas’ Church, by the Venerable the
Archdeacon, the Rev. James Clow, one of the Honourable Company s
Chaplains, and Minister of the Church of Scotland, to Miss Margaret
Morison.
Some have enquired where did Cain get his wife from? Can we blame
Cain that he told none of his love affairs? We have gone to some pains
to discover where Clow got his wife from. There is no trace of hei
family in Scotland that I could discover. Her name does not appear on
list of passengers on the Jemima, nor was she known in India Seeing
Clow immediately married upon his return from Europe 1 think Miss
Morison would be a lady he made the acquaintance of whi e in Scot an ,
and that he married her in the Presbyterian Church in the homeland.
He however, would be put on his guard that this marriage would do m
Scotland or England, but it would not be legal in India. A move wa
on foot to get Scotch marriages legalized m India and an Act to this
effect was passed by the Imperial Government on sth June, 1818. As
he did not sail from England until 20th August, Clow would possibly
conclude that he would have no need to recognize the Church of Eng-
land in the matter. The ship’s captain, however, would inform him
that the Act would not come into effect in India until the Proclamation
of the Act there, and to be on the safe side the Captain registered
neither her marriage nor maiden name, hut shipped her as cargo, be-
lieving the Proclamation would be ahead of them.
Yet it seems as if the boat that carried the Act also must-have car-
ried them, and there was no chance for it to reach its destination
first. Then going ashore and finding the Act was not as yet published
he got married in the Anglican Church. Still this is only conjecture.
There may be nothing in it, and when composing history
is more likely to bear one a thousand miles from the truth than to
it. It is worthy of note that Peter Clow called one of his girls aftei
her, which shows she was esteemed by him.
Looked at from another viewpoint allowing the lady to have been
a European resident in India-which is quite possAle-Clow could have
married her in the Scotch Church had he waited another month The
Act to legalize Scotch marriages in India was authorized at Bombay
Castle on 27th April, 1819, and published in the “Courier on Ist May,
1819 The Anglican Archdeacon must have smiled at the beautitm
advantage he gained over Clow, and would give the Bishop hopes to
further obstruct, as we shall see he did later on.
The following children were the result of the union:—
James Maxwell Clow (no record of birth, marriage, or death).
May Elizabeth Clow; born 27/6/1821; died 1823.
Helen Johanna Clow; born 24/10/1822.
Margaret Jessie Clow; born 28/1/1824.
Mary Elizabeth Clow; born 1/3/1825.
Jane Clow; born 3/7/1828; died a week later
Jane Clow; born 4/3/1830 at Ootacamund Neilghernes.
Henry Moncreiff Clow; born 30/3/1832.
Isabella Clow; married 25/3/1856 (only record).
Emma Clow; married 28/9/1852 (only record).


To give an idea as to how brief a thing life is all these children, we
might say, were born within twenty years of the death of their grand-
father, and all their children are now dead. I have noticed in bio-
graphical research that four generations will barely cover a hundred
years. My advice to anyone is: If you feel there is anything important
that you would like to do —do it now. An odd man lives to be seventy.
If so, most of his children die before him or immediately afterwards.
Now we will refer back to the opening of the Christian Temple,
Bombay.
On the 10th March, 1819, Clow notified the Government that he was
ready to commence the celebration of Divine service as soon as the
Government gives me notice that the place intended for the purpose is
in readiness.
The Governor-in-Council on the 24th March ordered that the Chief
Engineer be directed:
To deliver over to Mr. Clow the Church built at this Presidency
for the members of the Church of Scotland, of which Mr. Clow is
to be informed with the information that this building was com-
pleted in the month of October last, and authority given for its
transfer to the Kirk Session, but Messrs. Erskine, Taylor and Max-
well having stated that they were not authorized to receive charge
of the building during his absence, it has continued under the care
of the Superintending Engineer.
The following paragraph appeared in the Bombay Gazette, Wednes-
day, 28th April, 1819: —
The Scotch Church was opened for the first time for Divine Ser-
vice on Sunday last (25th April, 1819), when an excellent discourse
suitable to the occasion was delivered by the Reverend James Clow,
one of the Chaplains on the Honourable Company’s establishment,
the text being from a part of the last verse of the 10th Chapter of
Nehemiah:
“And we will not forsake the house of our God.”
This is the only text of Scripture connected with Clow’s ministry in
India that I have discovered in the Records.
The Temple, as originally designed by Goodfellow, included a belfry
and cupola, but the Christian people associated with the Scotch Church
said they would prefer to have a steeple than a cupola, as they thought
it would be more appropriate for a Church, and that it would look
better.
Had I been placed as James Clow was I would have dropped the ques-
tion of building a steeple for I would not have been able to see as far
ahead as he saw. Follow the matter down, and it can be seen that
James Clow was right, and the thing was well worth striving for.
The Government made excuse that the building would require to be
strengthened for a steeple, and they objected to the increased expense.
The man who was really objecting to a steeple being erected on the
Temple was the Church of England Bishop, but the Presbyterians did
not know that at this time. The Bishop was looking forward to the
day when there would be only one recognized religion in India, and
that the Anglican Church.
Clow requested the Government to suspend operations, and not to
proceed with the erection of the belfry and cupola until he had time
to reflect. Thinking that perhaps three heads were better than one,
Clow decided to confer with his brethren at Madras and Calcutta to see
if they could guide him as to procedure. I fancy Madras must have
feared that Clow’s safety might be involved, but Calcutta were very
militant, and they advised Clow to take his argument to the steps of
the Throne.
Clow then made another request to the Bombay Government, saying:—
It gives me pain to have even the appearance of differing in
opinion from the Honourable Board.
But he could not shake them, and from here on the correspondence
seems a little confused, so that I can’t tell which letter was written


first. It looks to me as if the Elders met in Session and decided upon
what to say, and then departed somewhat from the text upon which
they had decided. The following is what the Elders agreed upon:
It is sufficiently obvious that Divine Worship may he celebrated
with as much reverence and devotion in a hovel as in the most
elegant edifice, but there are certain external marks of respect and
civility which are paid to and expected by friendly and authorized
religions. Here we are all strangers among the heathen; there is
no long-existing Christian religion except that of the Roman
Catholics, and a request to have a spire, however insignificant at
may appear, can only gain consequence by being refused. It has been
granted in Calcutta and Madras. It is a symbol of the hospitality of
Government to the Scotch Church. It is a mark of respect to ihe
established religion in one part of the British Kingdom, and as such,
in the present instance, the Kirk Session think it a duty which they
owe to the Establishment to which they belong, and to the East
India Company to ask it.
It looks as if, after reflecting, the Elders met again and tried to im-
prove on the composition of what is just cited, but, I think myselt,
they were suffering from brain fag, for in the next attempt they mere y
say the same thing over again—only more of it. Whereas in the first
they only refer to the Catholics, they now mention also the Armenians,
Jews, Mussulmans, Hindus, and pagans “of every caste and colour. In
the first draft they regard the Church of Scotland as “one part ot cne
British Kingdom,” now it is “one half of Britain.” In the first a spire
is “a symbol of hospitality,” now it has become “a harmless privilege.
As men become worried their ideas enlarge.
There is more of this correspondence than I can make use ot in tins
treatise, for much of it is wearisome and tedious. My own opinion is,
and it is borne out by a long life of experience, when men become over-
worried over what they deem an important matter, they should not
write themselves to an influential centre upon it. Call in a tresh man
who knows nothing of the subject whatever; tell him the whole story,
then don’t interfere with him further, and allow him to compose a
letter for you. He wall gather in one interview all the important out-
standing features of the case. For he assured of this—it is only _ so
much of the story as impresses him will impress the official at the other
end. Whatever you add in addition to that is only pouring into a tint
The Elders of Bombay are to be complimented in that they main-
tain a graceful tone right throughout, and write with a dignified and
highly becoming humility, hut there is too much of it. They have really
but one argument; that is: As they are situated in the famous shrine ot
paganism, raising their towers and minarets to the clouds, and where
the Armenian, Syrian, and Catholics display their magnificent spires, a
respectable body meeting in an unsymbolised building might be re-
garded by the Natives and Europeans as a sect of heretics.
They presented an appeal to the Court of Directors of the East India
Company, London. Their Memorial was forwarded to England
through the Governor of Bombay, and begins: —
To the Honourable the Court of Directors of the United Company
of Merchants of England, trading in the East Indies, Leaden Ball
Street London: It was a subject of no small satisfaction to the
members of the Church of Scotland scattered oyer these remote
regions to find their situation regarded and provided for by your
Honourable Court in a manner so suited to the enlightened policy
which produced your resolution.
The Memorial is of no value from a literary viewpoint; it is merely
words, and it is of no service as an Historical Souvenir, ior in the tran-
script clauses have been dropped out, but what remains shows it was
all of a similar. After waiting until 25th June, 1820, and hearing no-
thing respecting the fate of their Memorial, they refresh the memory
of the Directors by sending them another. According to the Edin-
burgh Record, on 16th March, 1822, the Directors gave their consent to


a steeple being erected. A plan for a spire was drafted by Major
Cowper on 16th May, 1822, and the little Church was delightfully pleased
with it, saying it would be “handsome and appropriate to the building.”
It is now not certain when it was completed, but it was finished some
time before 9th March, 1823.
The spire cost £762—thus the total cost of the Temple was £5,351. This
is a very large sum considering how cheap labour and material was in
India, and every penny of this money was paid by the East India Com-
pany. Some say they do not believe in Government aid for the Church.
It is nothing to any man’s credit to say that now, for no man could
get it if he wanted it. But it is this way: It is far better to have the
Government assisting than opposing, as many of the wretched Latin
Governments of history did—and burnt the saints. The Australian
public will always feel grateful for the help they gave James Clow,
because he is our man.
It came out later that the man who caused all the trouble about
the steeple was the Bishop of Calcutta. When asked by the Govern-
ment to state his reasons, he said:—-
Steeples are not allowed to the Scots in London nor in any
Diocese in England.
To this the Bombay Government replied:—
We deem it necessary to apprise your Lordship that we have
reason to believe from information that has reached us that a
steeple is actually allowed to the Episcopal Church in Edinburgh.
The Bishop answered:—
I do not know what takes place in Edinburgh
And it is related that when he said this he gave an Anglican snort that
was audible m India for half a century.
In many ways getting the spire was an advantage. Without the
steeple the building might have one day been converted into Govern-
ment offices, but a steeple made a Church of it, and meant eternal
possession for the saints. The Superintendent of Records in the
Office ot the East India Company, London, drew my attention to it.
1 hat previous to the building ot the steeple Clow is mentioned in the
Records as “A Chaplain on the Company’s Establishment, Bombay,”
but after the steeple was built he is never again mentioned in the
Records as Chaplain on the Bombay Establishment. After that his
“ a PP e ars on the Civil Lists, and he is always referred to as
Minister ot the Presidency, Church of Scotland.”
Referring now to Australian History. It was said of John Dunmore
Lang m 1863; —
Dr. Lang has done more to advance the prosperity of this country
than all other men put together.
Again, the writer of his obituary notice said:—
Death has removed from us perhaps the ablest man it has
been the good fortune of Australia to number among its population.
These statements are really too sweeping to be graceful. I would
not like to say that James Clow accomplished more good in India than
all other men put together, nor would I even like to sav he achieved
more good than any other one man—that would he a big thing to say.
There were many noble-hearted men who laboured hard in the cause
of their Blessed Redeemer in India, and sacrificed their lives there for
Christ—all honour to them.
But devoting attention to Lang, particularly as his friends have
thrown down the gauntlet, on behalf of James Clow I will take up the
challenge. Clow possibly had not the natural force that Lang had,
hut he got there just the same—and considerably sooner than Lang
did. Clow gained the freedom of the Scotch Church in India more
than fifteen years before Lang won it for New South Wales. The
Presbyterian Church was begun in what we call the Mother Colony,
in a place called Hawksbury, in 1809. Lang arrived in Sydney in 1823/’


Sir Thomas Brisbane was then in office as Governor. Brisbane was
an Army General, and had served in the Peninsula War. He was
fond of the study of astronomy, and while in Sydney calculated the
period of revolution of Encke’s comet, and catalogued seven thousand
stars of the Southern Hemisphere. He and Lang belonged to the same
district in Scotland, and attended the same school. He, too, was a
Presbyterian as Lang was, so the newly-arrived minister expected
great help from him, but they did not get on well together.
Like Clow, Lang contemplated building a Scotch Church in Sydney,
but he was a little more modest in his expectations of money, for he
estimated his building at £2,000. Lang approached Brisbane for a
Government grant, and this is what he got. It was not delivered to
him privately either, but published in the Sydney Gazette: —
When the Presbyterians of the Colony shall have advanced, by
means of private donations, in the erection of a Temple worthy of
Religion —When in the choice of their Teachers they shall have
discovered a judgment equal to that which has presided at the
selection of the Roman Catholic Clergymen —When they shall have
practised what they propose: “To instruct the people to fear God
and honour the King”—When, by “endeavouring to keep the unity
of the spirit in the bond of peace” in a Colony requiring it more
than all others, they shall have shown through their lives in influence
of the Holy Religion they profess —Then assuredly, will the Colonial
Executive step forward “to extend its countenance and support” to
those who are following the Presbyterian Creed. (Sgd.) Thomas
Brisbane, Government House, Sydney, Wednesday, Sept. 24, 1823.
Letter writing is very serious business, though few there are that
ever realize it. It would have been better had this letter never been
written. Lang was aiming at the same things as Clow, but being a
fighter he struck a fighting attitude, and he got all the fighting that he
required, but he did not succeed in Sydney as well as Clow did in
India. In endeavouring to improve matters, Brisbane only further
involved himself. A sermon Lang had preached on 15th June, 1823, was
possibly still in his mind. The Text was Haggai i. 14: —
The Lord stirred up the spirit of the Governor, Priest, and People,
and they came and did the work in the House of the Lord their
God.
This sermon was published, but not until 28th October —which would
be after Brisbane’s letter had appeared. Still, he had, possibly, known
all about it. That the spirit of the Governor was stirred up there is
not room for two opinions, and a section of the people as well. As
for the spirit of the priest, well, it was a going concern. In the sermon
he said: —
I confess I had always little to expect from the smiles of patrons,
or the friendship of right honourable men, and I trust 1 shall
always have scorn to tread in those paths of crooked policy by
which the heights of church preferment are so often and dishonour-
ably gained. The good providence of God and my own unaided
exertions were my sole dependence in my native land, and with
this dependence, brethren, I was not given to despond. You are
aware, moreover, that I have not studied to anticipate your favour
by letters of commendation. I came to minister among you, deter-
mined to be my own epistle of commendation.
‘ I rather like the tone of his remarks, and it is certainly the language
of an eloquent man, and, though I have read the sermon from which
I have given an extract, I can see nothing in it to which any right-
thinking person might take exception. Still, I have shown how Brisbane
expressed himself. Afterwards, in trying to explain his letter, Brisbane
said:—
Toleration is the glory of the Church of England, and therefore, if
Presbyterians did not approve her ritual, she did not forbid them
to worship in any other way which they might think to glorify
religion.


To this Lang replied:—
Toleration is not the glory of the Church of England but of the
British Constitution, Scotchmen are not therefore reduced to the
necessity of receiving toleration as a boon from the Church of
England. Their civil and religious liberties were won for them by
the swords of their forefathers, and they, in every situation, were
a degenerate race if they did not vindicate their right to both.
On receiving this, Brisbane, who had promised a donation to the
Temple, withdrew his name from the list of subscribers. On account
of the Church wishing help from the Government, they could not do
other than get Brisbane to lay the foundation stone, which was done on
Ist July, 1824. Still the Government gave them no assistance. Instead
of sending a request in writing to London, as Clow had done in Bombay,
Lang went himself to London, and interviewed the Colonial Secretary.
Now, humble as Clow’s letters were to the Court of Directors in London,
It seems to me that the Earl of Bathurst had well perused them, for in
writing to Brisbane, Bathurst uses some of Clow’s own phrasing, which
lay before him in the Record Office. He instructed Brisbane to give
Lang one-third of the estimated cost of the Church out of the Treasury,
and added: —
To put to this probation the members of the Church of Scotland,
the Established Church of one of the most loyal and intelligent
Portions of Great Britain is, I am sure, what your Excellency will
on reflection consider to have been an ill-advised and extraordinary
Demand.
The actual cost of Scots Church, Sydney, was £3,000, and of this sum
Lang had to make himself personally responsible for £1,480 on the day
it was opened—for that amount could not be raised. So that it could
not possibly be said that Lang gained more for the Church of Scotland
in Sydney than Clow gained for Bombay. Neither can it be said that
Clow took a leaf out of Lang’s hook, seeing that Clow performed it first.
As a matter of fact they were both good men labouring for similar ends
but along different lines Had Clow been a politican like Lang he would
not have lasted three months in Bombay, for the East India Company
would never have endured an agitator on their Establishment.
We are now drawing near the close of Clow’s career in India. lam
sorry to leave the subject although it involved me in a lot of difficult
research work to bring to light things that had lain for a hundred
years—matters which were never known in Australia, hut which will
be appreciated in this country on account of the important part Clow
played in the history of Melbourne.
Clow’s evangelistic work continued without a break in Bombay until
the year 1828, when he began to show signs of collapse. He was not
a strong man at any time, and the marvel is that he ever lasted as
long as he did. It was at first thought that a rest would restore him,
and he was granted leave of absence for six months; a junior minister
did his work meanwhile. In September, 1829, he was again ill, and the
Government gave him permission to be absent for a year, but was again
in duty before 18th February, 1831. Still, a record now in possession of
the Bombay Government says:—
Mr. Clow has, from severe indisposition superinduced solely by
long residence in India, been absent on different occasions from
the scene of his labours during twenty-eight months of the past
three years.
Just here we come to a grave silence —there are no records. Perhaps
during his illness he was making no reports to the Government, and
possibly he was holding no Session meetings. Instead of cheering reports
we have now clouds of uncertainty. Perhaps men were afraid to speak;
it looks like it. Medical opinion had seemingly certified there was but
one chance to save Clow, and that was to get him away to a temperate
climate. What was to become of this man? A large family—nearly all
girls. The eldest child, a boy of 12. The report immediately after his
departure shows all branches of his work were in a healthy and pro-
mising condition. That year they had such a surplus of funds that


they made a distribution of it to the different Indian missions. But
of the man who planted this work —what of him? whither will he go.
He had not the voice of Jon Elias that he could arouse London, or the
constitution of Lang that he might stand for Parliament. Just a worn-
out missionary, and a missionary in a civilized land to this day is
looked upon with doubt, as if he were hut an untried vessel. I know
Reverend Clergymen will try to deny this, but which of them will ever
stand aside to give a worn-out missionary his Church or even risk his
own popularity by having him on the platform beside him? A man with
a reputation from a mission field has got but little to back him up.
Of course, in Clow’s case, the East India Company might stick to him,
but have they any right to stick to him? We must judge things by how
they stood at this very moment to realize the grave peril. Ido not
think that ever a man stood in a worse position. The end must have
come very suddenly. The records are a little confused, and they seem
to indicate that they had nothing in hand, and several after-thoughts.
This much is clear; On 20th January, 1833, Clow preached in the
Church at Bombay for the last time. Most likely the discourse revealed
his departure, and the Elders saw the importance of holding a Session
meeting at once.
A dark gloom pervades the atmosphere, in the midst of which Clow
tells the Elders that he is proceeding to Europe on sick certificate. They
seem dazed, and do not comprehend what he is saying, for their words
show that they gather out of it matter of uncertain meaning, as if he
is telling them by metaphor, of the end he will accomplish on the
voyage or in London, and the uncertain consequences that will befall
his children.
Some say the Church should stand by a man, but there are hours in
the lives of all men when all institutions are powerless. An hour when
God only can be his help, and the Elders of Bombay realized it on
20th January, 1833, and it was decided: —
That Mr. Clow be requested to furnish the Session with a copy
of the affectionate feeling and appropriate address delivered from
the pulpit at the conclusion of his sermon preached this day, that
it may be placed upon the records of this Church, as his parting
admonition to the people to whom his ministrations have so long been
delivered. And it was further moved and unanimously agreed to
that Mr. Clow be requested to place his excellent sermon preached
that day at the disposal of the Session for publication in such man-
ner as may be determined on.
Observe there are two distinct motions here. We can only judge what
happened by what is recorded. It is clear that Clow preached his
usual sermon, and the preacher saw the people inclined to remain with
him, thus he gave them a second address in the form of an admonition.
What was said is not revealed, for the minutes are written in the oblique
form I have not discovered either the sermon or the admonition—l am
still searching. Will they ever he found again? Ninety-five years have
lapsed! , .
These two minutes as they stand could not be handled by any scholar
to further advantage. The Elders evidently did not notice that all they
said was, that two sermons were delivered.
They recorded, however, another minute which might he handled to
very profitable account. Here the Elders are speaking directly:—
The Session moved that they express their sympathy in the dis-
pensation which has led to the event, and that Mr. Clow be requested
to accept their sincere thanks for his long and faithful and affec-
tionate pastoral service in the Church of Bombay, and their earnest
prayer that, wherever in the course of Divine Providence he may
he carried, the best blessing of Almighty God may rest upon him,
and that he may be long spared in health and strength to be useful
to his family and to the society in which his lot may be cast.
We are but mortals. It is very little knowledge that we have. I
am no scholar. Still, lam as well used to the composition of men as
any man of my day, and well acquainted with the composition of mighty
men at that. But'there is something in this composition that is strange


to me. Something I have never met before. This is the only prayer
on record offered for James Clow that I know of. Why has. this one
survived?
Is it prudent for me to offer any comments on this prayer—allow me
to think? I’ll risk it.
Was this prayer composed hy human intelligence? It is not for me
to say. It does not look to me like the expression of men although men
said it. Is this prayer the voice of God? I can but say it does not
seem to me like the voice of men, since it does not conform to their
customs either in reason or language. I can simply point out some
remarkable features about the prayer. Clow, in opening the Session
meeting, makes obscure reference to his proceeding to Europe on sick
certificate. Strange, though Clow used the word “Europe,” the Elders
do not pick up the word, hut substitute it with the word “wherever.”
Could human wisdom have devised that the actual place of his destiny
was at that moment not yet named or even discovered? The Elders
“express their sympathy with the dispensation which has led to the
event.” One would naturally have expected them to say they regret
the circumstances which has led to the event. But they do not put it
that way. Did they realize, like Eli, that God had called the man to
some great service, and that this was God’s way of calling him? There
was no useful post of service looming for him at the moment the prayer
was offered.
They ask Clow' to accept their sincere thanks for his work and their
earnest prayer for the future, “that the best blessing of Almighty
God may rest upon him.” I have heard men in prayer asking for God’s
“richest blessing,” but this is the. first time I have met the phrase “best
blessing.” As we go down through all that followed in Clow’s career
we will keep this well in mind. “And that he may be long spared in
health and strength.” The Clow family are for the most part very
short lived. Only an odd one lives to a good old age, and none to a
great age. What are the prospects of this man being long spared,
twenty-eight months off duty during the past three years?
Do not men usually pray for a sick brother in this way; “Lord, if it
is Thy will, restore this man to his usual health and strength or other-
wise let him go”—or words to that effect? They qualify their request
with safeguards. We are so commercial in our ways we cannot afford
to take risks even in prayer. “To be useful to his family.” What pros-
pects are ahead of his family?—return to England and then they
could obtain employment as domestic servants at half-a-crown a week,
working from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.? That is all that was offering in
those times. Observe the Elders do not limit his future usefulness to
the Church only but “to the society in which he may cast his lot.”
A singular thing about this is that for ninety-five years the Church at
Bombay never knew what became of Clow or his family until I wrote
and told them that, in a marvellous manner, the prayer of the Elders
had all been fulfilled, and then a search among the old records brought
the prayer to light.
The next day dawned 21st January, 1833, and the usual business of
Bombay went its ordinary course, and while men were engaged in other
matters, the saints were discussing the impression of the previous day.
There was no opportunity for a farewell banquet, with its tine speeches
and an illuminated address. Time was too brief, and besides the man
was too unwell. Much indeed, could have been said, for, while he was
pastor in India, the Church of Scotland there had won the right to
celebrate its own marriages, which carried with it the right of all other
denominations to do the same —a right that was not extended to New
South Wales until the passing of the Bourke Act in 1836. Possibly few
in the religious denominations to-day realize that almost up to the
present day, most likely their members would have had to toe the
carpet in the Anglican Church for the marriage ceremony throughout
the British Dominions only for the work that Clow and Lang put in.
Clow’s work in India was vast, but what to do to preserve the memory
of it was not easy for the Brethren to decide upon. “Will we see him
again?” “Never!” Possibly something like this was said, which gave
a suggestion. A letter was composed of which only a quotation has


survived. The thought has struck me that it was by the authority of
the Government. Some say the Session, but the Session could not meet
without the minister. A letter was drafted a quotation from which
can be seen in the Records at Edinburgh which was copied out by Rev.
Dr. Ogilvie in September, 1924. I might here remark that Dr. Ogilvie
was many years a Chaplain in India, and was connected with Madras
University, and died 9th June, 1926. The extract made by this gentle-
man was forwarded to me. There is also a reference to the letter pre-
served in Roinbay. The gist of both is:—
Ry letter delivered to Mr. Clow, at Bombay, 22nd January, 1833,
Mr. Clow is requested to sit before a respectable artist (in England)
in his (pulpit) robes and have a framed portrait sent to Bombay
at our expense.
The words “in England” are in Dr. Ogilvie’s extract, but they are
not in the Bombay reference. The word “pulpit” is in the Bombay
reference but not in Dr. Ogilvie’s extract. All knowledge of this
letter must have died out during the next few years. It therefore seems
to me that only a few were concerned in it. The two references to the
letter have both only been recently discovered.
This is the last incident that happened of which we have any know-
ledge, and this information is very imperfect.
Now the last (very brief): —
Finally left India on sick leave, 27th January, 1833
This is on Record in Whitehall, London. I discovered it sth December,
1925.
Now we enter upon a period for which there are no records to guide
us. What would Clow most likely do? The chief thing to consider is
what circumstances was he in. Did he have much money when he
left India? In my early life I thought he had, but researches have
caused me to modify my views. He would only have a stipend of about
£2OO per annum. Thus, if the pension comes, it would only be about
one pound per week, no more.
In view of what he afterwards achieved, a gentleman once asked me
if I thought he married a wealthy lady in India. Impossible. A man
in his position would never have attracted an heiress. Indeed, she was
a brave woman to ever have taken him on at all. Had she been an
heiress we would have experienced no difficulty in tracing her genealogy.
Then, finally, the records show that after their marriage, at consider-
able inconvenience to himself, they had to reside in a little villa in the
country, because they could not afford to pay the rent ot a house in
town. , .
On leaving Bombay, the outlook for Clow and his family must have
been dark enough. Indeed, they appear to me to be the darkest hours
of his life. There are no records possibly because there was nothing
doing. On leaving Bombay what became of him? lam now old. I
have held but one view all my life and I hold it still. To my mind
the first thing he would do would be to proceed to the office of the
East India Company, London, and draw his clearance. This is what any
Government official would do. It could have been that he called at
Van Dieman’s Land on the voyage, but that is immaterial. From the
sea captains he had met at Bombay, he possibly was already well-
informed about New South Wales. London would be his direct object
first.
It was arranged in London, whether it was effected by correspondence
or by personal interview, that he should retire on 10th October, 1833,
and "this was notified to the Bombay Government in the Company’s
General Letter, 4th December, 1833. This shows conclusively, to my
mind, that Clow was associated with the Company from 10th October,
1813 the twenty years’ term —though the time of his appointment and
ordination do not show it. Possibly he spent some time in training
before election.
Having drawn his clearance with the Company, and on being awarded
a pension for life, Clow, I think, would see his brother Peter. I think
30
THE PACIFIC EMPIRE.


James also visited Antwerp with a view to learning something of his
ancestors, for much I say in the first Chapter of this book was from his
own lips. Clow told Wilkie certain things that Wilkie related to mother
and mother told me; things that have been verified by subsequent re-
search. Clow was an energetic man. Too much so to have been idle.
There is something that happened in 1834 that is interesting, to which
I will refer later. In 1834 another daughter was born to James, which
strengthens my belief that he had seen Peter, and having learned that
his brother had named one of his girls after the minister’s wite, James
returned the compliment and called his newly-born girl Isabella, after
Peter’s wife.
I have no records to guide me but I am pretty certain as to what
happened soon afterwards. John Batman left Van Dieman’s Land with
a party of associates, and sailed through Port Phillip Heads on 19th
May, 1835, and on the night of the 20th he slept under a gum tree where
the Customs House, Melbourne, now stands. He spoke of the country
he had discovered in Doutta Galla as “some of the finest country I ever
saw in my life.” A map of the district and a letter accompanying it was
sent by Governor Arthur to the Imperial Government on 4th July, 1835.
Most likely this information would reach London about the end ot
October. Clow had no doubt discussed with the officials the idea of
migrating to New South Wales to settle his family on the land, and 1
think at the Record Office they must have drawn Clow’s attention to
Batman’s communication, for being connected with the Government, it
is reasonable to suppose he got his information at first hand. This is
all the light I can throw upon the matter, and I do not think it can
be far astray, although I cannot verify the thing with newspaper cutting
or authentic record. Although I cannot produce photographs of the
group, I believe Clow left the Old Country in three small vessels before
November, 1835, taking with him William—his brother, Peter’s, son. I
I know this story is discredited by the Clow family in the Old Country
to-day, but I will hold it. lam certain that I know more about this
matter than any living person, and the dead can say nothing.
Like a good Scotchman, William Moffat Clow holds to his opinion
without wavering. He says, “I cannot get it out of my head that if
James Clow returned to Scotland, how it was that my father, who would
then be a lad of about sixteen years, said nothing about it. Seeing the
event is supposed to have stirred Scotland, one would naturally think
he would have talked of it all the days of his life.”
It is in the Record Office in London that James Clow arrived in Eng-
land in May, 1833 —from thence onward he cannot be traced. There has
been a lot of money spent on it with no result, but we will leave that
subject and follow events on in Bombay in so far as they affect our
subject.
As the years rolled by a new congregation filled the Scotch Church, and
an oil painting—a half-length portrait of the first minister—hung in the
Vestry. A complaint was raised that the natives who remembered
James Clow found his portrait in the Session-room, and came there and
worshipped it. Archibald Graham, a doctor of medicine, and who had
only been a few months in office as Elder, brought the subject under the
notice of the Session. There was no record as to who painted the
picture or where it originated.
The Session, considering that the picture has been abused by the
natives to the purposes of idolatry, and that it is in many respects
Inexpedient to have such a picture visible from the Church during
Divine service, unanimously resolve that it should be taken down,
and recommend that those whose property it is should send it to
New South Wales to the Rev. Mr. Clow, to be there kept as a family
picture or otherwise got rid of.
The picture still remained on the wall, and it was not for long a seri-
ous trouble to Graham. He was one of those men too often met with
in church life; strict and straight—that straight that he leaned the
other way. For when the Church met the hour of trial, caused by the
Disruption of 1843, with much palaver and apology for the step he was
about to take, he freed his sandals from the dust of a congregation in


receipt of State aid, and with a few Elders and some of the congregation
as simple-minded as himself, he went off to set up a Free Church, hut the
whole squadron were lost in oblivion.
There is a record in India, “Apparently the Clow family were not tak-
ing an heirloom.” I don’t think they knew anything about it. In 1886
the matter is again referred to: —
An oil painting of the Rev. Dr. Clow, first minister of St. Andrew’s
Church, who indeed was instrumental in having it built. Time has
laid its hand on the picture, as any member of the congregation
might see for himself, and it is necessary that the picture and its
frame should be touched up and renewed. It is thought that ten
pounds will suffice for the purpose.
The money to renovate the portrait, however, could not be found.
It is a pity this matter was not known, for had they only known of it
the Trustees of the *Art Gallery, Melbourne, would have given the Bom-
bay Church a hundred pounds for the portrait.
In 1895 the subject is again referred to for the last time: —■
The members of the Session inspected the portrait of the Rev.
Dr. Clow, which had been taken down and removed from its frame.
It was resolved that inquiry should be made about the possibility
and cost of the renovation of the picture. But nothing was done,
and some years later it was removed —in the dust cart.
Poor little portrait. I fancy I can see it going. I found a reference
to this in the Edinburgh Records, which reads: —
After inspection the portrait was found to be beyond restoration,
hut what became of it is not stated.
It would be about this time that I began to be interested in the life
of James Clow, and to recover his history from the dust box, and to
recover facts on which the dust had lain undisturbed for a hundred
years. This has been an arduous task, sometimes mingled with opposi-
tion and scorn.
LIUII Cl 11 Cl
There is a Clow, of scholarship, and a friend approached him to assist
me to compose this treatise, and he made answer that he would write
to me. He did so, but only to discourage the undertaking. He said,
“I looked up the records of the Rev. James Clow, whom you mention, with
just tribute, hut could not find much that was authentic.” I replied
asking him to persevere, as I felt confident that further research
would bring its sure reward, and this is what I got: “Your whole-hearted
enthusiasm in the matter of Clow genealogies and developments fills me
with a certain wonder, and the trouble you take is most praiseworthy.
But I think as I suggested—no more. I feel unable to keep step with
you.” This he concludes with “I hope that, while you may not sym-
pathize with my point of view, you will reklize how sincerely I hold to,
and hope to act upon, it.” This he followed with another letter ex-
pressing himself in the same way. I got both letters by the same mail.
The second letter is concluded with, “I am sorry that I cannot write a
more pleasing response to your kindness, but I feel sure your earnest
mind will go on in the course your heart approves.”
This man is what we sometimes call a big gun. Still, were I to quote
these letters more fully, and reply to them, and disclose the writer, 1
could do him a lot of harm, but lam not out for that purpose. I have
not attained to that scholarship my critic has, but I have quite suffi-
cient to apportion to him his inheritance in this work. On the one
hand this man is afraid of the past being perused, lest it might bring
to light something that may not flatter the Clan, and on the other hand
he is haunted by a mean fear that a greater chandelier than his own
torch might come into evidence. So the safe course would be tor the
history of the Clow family to begin with him. . , ,
Biographical research is not to he discouraged, for it is the founda-
tion of all literature. Poetry and Drama are simply History set to Har-

mony. The Scriptures are almost wholly biographical, and unless we
had biographical knowledge the parables would be unintelligible. So
much in defence; now for an advance. What are Ethics? If all the
books on Ethics in the world were emptied into the ocean would man-
kind be any poorer? The best book on Ethics would not do a man as
much good as his breakfast. It is improvement in composition to write
them and exercise in reading to read them, but there their utility ends.
The weakness of such hooks is, no real man ever performed it. The
more magnificently the precepts are enshrined, the more incredible their
accomplishment. To the average man a hook on Ethics is but a shower
of mist that beclouds his pathway. But biography is life written. It
is a time table which tells where to obtain a train of action to arrive
at a certain destiny. By telling us how one man did a certain thing, it
expounds how we may achieve similar results.
Think of the days when James Clow gathered the twelve Christians to-
gether to the first celebration of the Lord’s Supper at Bombay, and of
the little tokens he issued, “Do this in remembrance of Me,” and realize
what a powerful institution this Church is to-day. Its mission agencies.
Its orphanage work. Its industidal school, and its distribution of Chris-
tian magazines, and truly this is a work that should commend itself to
the generosity of Australia, for we owe something to Asia. To those
who can afford it, I say pay a pilgrimage to Bombay. The collection
box and communion service that were used by James Clow, and on
which were engraven the wreath of Scotch thistles, are still in use in
the Church there to-day.
It is strange that of all that James Clow accomplished, after he left
India, not a word of it ever reached the congregation among whom he
had laboured until I wrote and informed them of it nearly a hundred
years later.
The Kirk Session met at St. Andrew’s Church, Bombay, Tuesday, 14th
December, 1926, at 6 p.m. There were present, Messrs. A. D. Shanks,
R. G. Bohottom, E. H. Hawes, and H. J. W. High, Elders, and Rev. Dr.
George Cook Macpherson, Moderator, and from them I received the
following letter: —
St. Andrew’s Church,
R. J. Clow, Esq., December 18th, 1926.
Clow-Library, Hayes Street,
Queanbeyan, Federal Capital,
Australia.
Dear Mr. Clow, —
I communicated to my Kirk Session, at our meeting on Tuesday,
your letter of 23/11/26, and there was no small interest in the
receipt of it.
I enclose a copy of an extract of our Minutes, and I have posted
to you a copy of the History of St. Andrew’s, and I am now posting
to you an inkstand made out of the wood of an old pew of St.
Andrew’s.
The copies of photos. I hope to send later, but the getting of these
will take some little time.
Yours faithfully.
G. C. Macpherson.
I have traced the Indian records right to the end, and can testify that
after James Clow left Bombay on 27th January, 1833, there is no proof
that he ever saw it again. There is a record in London that he reached
there in May, but beyond that we can’t follow his movements. The
portrait was painted after that. Where was it executed? Did he visit
Antwerp, and there have it done? There was something that happened
in 1834 that may have some bearing on his movements or it may not
have. On the 25th of November the Moderator at Bombay was in-
structed by the Government that the Church organized by James Clow
was to be called “St. Andrew’s Church.” Was this suggested to the
Government by Clow himself? Is it likely during the interim he visited
St. Andrew’s, Antwerp, where the Clow family originated? I know
it is contended that “Andrew” is Scotch. It is a matter of scholarship
of course, but I think myself the Word came from Asia.


CHAPTER IV.
The First that Endured.
“The voice of ages, yea, of every clime.
The hoary records of primeval time.”
-—Goronwy Owam.
HOUGH I cannot well afford the space it may occupy, I
am forced to pause here and make a break in my
narrative to consider some literary references, which,
because they are historic, must be dealt with before I
can proceed". Christ said all the Literature of Israel
depended on two commandments. On two statements
respecting James Clow all references to him in Australian
U U Jll v- U , „
History have been constructed, but, correctly written, the history ot
Melbourne, for the first twenty years, is the history of James Clow. The
first of these statements is
Fifteen years chaplain to the troops in India.
And the second is like unto it:
The last Sunday of the year
On these two statements hang all the literary and clergymen of Aus-
tralia, and the meaning you attach to the word “hang is optiona . -
can either be taken as historic, or received as a command. Stewait
(1909, p. 2), says:
The last Sunday of the year 1837 —that is a historic date.
This is not a date—it is a declaration of doubt. It is a survival o
oral literature. It was originally coined by an unlettered brain wan e -
ing in a field of ignorance—a lost man. The marvel is that educated
men ever repeated it. As for being historic, the statement admits that
it is not as old as the event referred to. It is not a there and the
fixture (self-evident). A looking back (candidly confessed). It m * y
have been authentic had it been left in its original form, but somebody
monkeyed with it after it was coined. A there and then man would
not have said, “The last Sunday of the year 1837.” If the date at the
moment could not be got, conciseness still would be aimed at, and a
man of the time would have said, “The last day of the year, tor in 1837
Sunday was the last day of the year, and he would have known it. But
since he said, “The last Sunday of the year,” it shows he was aware
that other days followed before the year expired. The reference there-
fore does not refer to the year 1837, but to year. Ihe rest
of the statement is possibly authentic; hut 1837 has been tacked on
since the statement left the maker’s hands—it is therefore spurious.
The expression did not originate with Clow for he was particular in
the use of dates, and in announcing his meetings he used the term
“Lord’s Day” not “Sunday.”
When a new pastor was recently, a note on the history
of Scots Church appeared in “The Age”:—
It is officially recorded that the Rev. James Clow, a retired Presby-
terian minister, who had settled with his family in Melbourne,
conducted the first Presbyterian service held in this citj offi
December 25, 1837.


This date is not reliable, for, as can be seen, it is in conflict with the
time given in the previous quotation. *ln the second place, it is stated
that his first service was the first Sunday after he arrived. If that was
the 25th Sunday must have fallen on Monday that week, for, correctly
speaking, Sunday would be the 24th, and he could not have preached on
Monday unless he had been in the Settlement overnight to have an-
nounced his meeting. “Third James Clow never conducted a religious
service in his life on Christmas Day, except when it fell on Sunday.
That is recorded in the Bombay Records. That date is an error in the
transcript. Change the last figure of the year from 7 to 6 and it has
everything else to support it for.
In 1836
CHRISTMAS DAY FELL ON SUNDAY
it was
December 25
and
It was the last Sunday of the year.
There is nothing to cause alarm in me suggesting this, for James
Clow was in Melbourne six months before the Christmas of 1836.
This error in history crept in because there were no early records
in connection with the inauguration of the Presbyterian Church. James
Clow simply made entries in his own book which naturally passed into
family possession and was never afterwards consulted. Both Bonwick
and McCombie made a mistake as to the year of the arrival of James
Forbes, putting it 1839 instead of 1838. To make this agree with fact
the Church records placed his arrival back a year, which cut the minis-
try of James Clow clean out, and produced in literature the greatest
puzzle ever submitted to the Colonial public. For fifty years there have
been a dozen books on the shelves of our Public Libraries with this
conundrum in them that has misled every historian Australia has pro-
duced, and the clergy have not had sufficient energy to put it right.
We might pause in amazement that literary men, with all they know,
together with what they think they know, would suppose the great
Presbyterian Church of Victoria came into existence without any
preliminary effort to usher it in. Imagine a stranger, whose coming
was unexpected, arriving after midnight; purchased his land, built his
house, domiciled his family, gathered the settlers, and launched a church
within fifteen hours! This is what this official record affirms. The thing
is impossible.
Church historians devote more attention to notes of appreciation than
historical records. If they pick up a man, in case it should do some
living wanderer a good turn, they allude to him without reference to his
father, or mother, brothers, or children, so that practical men discard
him, and descendants disown him. The references to James Clow
in Victorian Histories are just sufficient to hand his name on to pos-
terity as a myth and a legend. Professor Rentoul used to deal with
Archbishops Carr and Goe as shinti-balls. Rentoul could tell you how
many times St. Paul had visited Rome, and that St. Peter was never
there at all. He could handle those subjects because they had been
handled previously. But to handle that which was not previously
handled is something academical men can’t do. How could Rentoul
explain how “St. Peter’s” originated at Rome when he could not tell
how Scots Church began? To the day of his death Rentoul never
knew when or where James Clow died, where he was buried, or by
whom. As a youth, I was at Scots Church often. I became imbued
with the thought that I would like to know the full history of the man
who planted the church, especially on account of what mother told me
of him. The passion grew, and I pursued the subject. I wrote to
* The first Sunday after his arrival appearing in Stewart (p. 3) does not refer to the
beginning of Scots Church hut to the open-air meeting Clow held on the bank of the
Yarra months before Scots Church began. ** The first Christmas Service that was
held in Bombay took place in 1902.


scores of Presbyterian clergymen in Victoria for information. I en-
closed stamps and small postal notes to defray cost of replies, and not
one of the ministers ever answered my letters. They call to mind a
familiar Scripture, “After a while another Pharaoh arose that knew not
Joseph.”
The only fact I knew to establish the historical character of James
Clow was that he had a brother named Peter. To me it seemed necessary to
search him out, but then a hundred years had passed; what hope was
there? I stuck to it for years —combed the whole of Scotland. 1
found Peter’s home, Bible, and grave, but had I not discovered the Bible
of Peter’s father, the identity of James Clow could never have been
established. God preserved this evidence for a hundred and fifty years,
and led me to it. I was no longer in doubt that he was the man for
whom Peter toiled that he might he a minister, hut was the James Clow
of India and this man identical? There is nothing in the Indian Church
records to show it. At last, and since I wrote the chapter on India, the
long-looked for certificate has come to hand, for which I am deeply
grateful to the Anglican Church.
The Reverend James Clow, of Bombay, Inhabitant and Minister
of the Church of Scotland, and Miss Margaret Morison, also of
Bombay, Spinster, were married in this Church by License from the
Hon’ble the Court of the Recorder this thirteenth day of April, in the
year of Our Lord, 1819, One thousand Eight hundred and Nineteen.
Bv me,
GEO. BARNES, D.D
Archdeacon of Bombay.
This Marriage was \ James Clow.
Solemnized between us ) Margt. Morison.
In the presence of us,

J. Taylor, M. Maxwell, P. Dardel, Benjm. Phillips, Harriet
Phillips, Maitland Erskine, B. Norton, R. T. Goodwin, John
Mack, C. N. Goodwin, R. A. Willis, A. Goodwin.
All that remains to he done now is to find another document
to prove that the man who married Miss Morison was the
son of Helen Gray. When we do that, and prove that the Port
Phillip Evangelist was the man who married Margaret Morison, and that
he was the son of Helen Gray, it will prove we have been following the
same man all the way through, and the chain of evidence will be
complete.
I am sorry to be found differing from a distinguished authority like
Thomas Francis Bride, LL.D., which is voiced in a letter by the Chief
Librarian of the Public Library. It was the outcome of something I
said in a letter to Mr. A. W. Greig as to how the “Letters from Victorian
Pioneers” originated. Space is too limited to exhaust these subjects.
In brief my view is: All that has happened in Melbourne has transpired
during the lives of my father and I, and I am vain enough to believe
that no one is more competent to expound James Clow than I am. He
was far too busy with other things to ever become a master of literature,
but he had a marvellous appreciation for fragments, and was ever gather-
ing them up. Pictures of the ships with which he travelled to and tro
to India were found among his records. It was Indian custom for
Ministers to write to the Governor on matters of interest concerning
themselves and their surroundings, making special mention of the
natives This was how the Government was kept informed as to what
was going on. Now, just bear this in mind, and read the circular Letter
issued to the Squatters by William Londsdale, the Chief Secretary. This
man was ever in company of Clow, so that in many things we find the
one is president, and the other vice-president. To gather information
for the future in Victoria, as he had done in India, had doubtless been
discussed on the many journeys these two men had made together on


their way to their holdings which were close together in Dandenong.
In his Letter to La Trobe (written in the third person) James Clow says:—
Mr. Joseph Hawdon, who may be considered the first that settled
on the Dandenong, as those who had preceded him had gone about
eight or ten miles to the east of it. He transferred his right to the
Dandenong run to Captain Lonsdale, who had Mr. Langhorne for his
overseer at the time Mr. Clow settled at Tirhatuan. Their head
station w'as at the bridge over the creek, where the present township
of Dandenong is situated.
Clow and Londsdale both went to Dandenong at the same time evidently,
and they were always together afterwards. How is it there is not in
any of the other Colonies to-day a collection of Letters of the Pioneers
as there is in Victoria? The answer is, James Clow was not in the other
Colonies to suggest it.
In “Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip,” by James Bonwick,
1856, page 137, the writer says:—
In the primeval days of worship in the little wooden box, when
Mr. James Smith read prayers in the morning, the Presbyterians
had service in the afternoon early in 1838. This was conducted
by the Rev. James Clow, formerly a Chaplain in the East India
Company’s Establishment, w'ho retired on his pension.
This is the most famous paragraph that was ever written on James
Clow, for out of it has grown all the references to him in Australian
Histories. Historians have had nothing else to draw upon. In view
of what we are likely to say directly, it is important to discover what
Bonwick affirms. I believe he is speaking of the primeval days—not of
the whole of them but of a period cut off, during which two men ran
their respective meetings in the same hall. This was the early part
of 1838. He adds a biographical account of Clow but not of Smith.
This is, I believe, all the paragraph contains. It bears the stamp of
authentic inspiration. The word “establishment” is an Indian idiom.
In Melbourne they said “settlement.” Now, having stated what the para-
graph says, we might point out what the paragraph does not say. It
does not state when Smith and Clow arrived in Port Phillip. Taking
the quotation as a guide, it would be as unreasonable to contend that
these two men never preached afterwards, as to argue they never
preached separately before it.
In “The History of the Colony of Victoria, from its Settlement to the
Death of Sir Charles Hotham,” by the Honourable Thomas McCombie,
1858, page 319, the author says:—
The first clergyman of the Presbyterian Church that settled in
Port Phillip was the Rev. James Clow, formerly a Chaplain in the
East India Company’s service, who, having retired on a pension,
had selected Australia as his future home. The venerable father
performed Divine service until the arrival of the Rev. James
Forbes.
This reference is valuable as it confirms the paragraph in Bonwick,
but it adds nothing further, and from then till now (a period of
seventy years) no literary man in Australia has been able to add any-
thing to what Bonwick stated. What they have given to us is the
same again with a fresh dressing.
“Victoria and Its Metropolis,” by Alexander Sutherland, 1886. I knew
Sutherland. There were five brothers, and each one took the Degree
of Master of Arts at Melbourne University.) On page 160 the writer
introduces this subject by saying: “Now, suppose it is Christmas time,
1837, and we go for a stroll.
“Yonder on the hill is a small wooden Church, raised by Dr.
Thompson’s exertions, a poor-looking structure, and hard by is a
gallows-like erection of posts on which swings the only bell that
tolls out its notes over the surrounding woods to welcome all of
every denomination to the services conducted by the Rev. James
Clow, who has come to take up a station, yet carries on his old
vocation on the Sunday afternoons.”


As Bonwick said early in 1838, it was an easy thing for Sutherland to
imagine he was there over-night, which would be New Year’s Eve. But
it is clear from this that Sutherland was not sure when the Presbyterian
services actually began. This, in itself, should have been sufficient to
have drawn the attention of the Ormond Professors to the importance
of gathering together those who could have informed them of the
very beginning. With the New Testament in their hands —in which
they specialize—why did they not call the wise men together and enquire
of them what time the star appeared? for there were then (1886) still
those living who accompanied James Clow to the Settlement, who were
on the same boat, and attended his first service. There were still in
their midst James Maxwell Clow and his sisters. Why did they allow
the authentic information of those days of struggle slip?
“The Australian Encyclopedia,” by Wilberforce Jose and Herbert
James Carter, 1926, Vol. 11., page 328:
The beginnings of Presbyterianism in Victoria can be traced
back to 1837, when James Clow, who had been chaplain for fifteen
years in the East India Company, arrived from Tasmania and held
the first Presbyterian service in Melbourne on the last Sabbath of
December.
Had the publishers of this volume, who knew me well, appealed to
me, I would have been glad to have supplied them with some fresh
material, instead of publishing the old matter again and again. I could
mention a number of other authors who have the same reference told
in the same old way. In a supplement to “The Argus,” to commemorate
its removal to new buildings, after an existence of eighty years, the
following appeared in “Courageous Pioneers, 1836-1926,” by Kenneth
Henderson:—
To the Rev. James Clow, a retired Presbyterian Chaplain of the
East India Company, belongs the honour of conducting the first
Presbyterian service in Melbourne. His health did not allow him
to take a settled charge, but he did honorary work for 21 years.
It would have been more serviceable had he written :• —-
Courageous Literary Men, 1836-1926. —To Kenneth Henderson be-
longs the distinction of having thoroughly satisfied Australia that
literary men are for the most part copyists^—seldom do they make
fresh research; but where one does, his literary brethren wear it to
death by repetition.
It is strange that no author ever cited one authority for any
statement he made regarding James Clow.
I was invited to lay my views before the Royal Historical Society, to
which the following letter refers: —-
University, Melbourne,
April 2nd, 1928.
R. J. Clow, Esq.,
Queanbeyan, N.S.W.
Dear Mr. Clow, —
Your notes on the life of the Rev. Jas. Clow were read at our
last meeting, and aroused a good deal of interest. The Society
passed a unanimous vote of thanks to you for the contribution, and
I undertook to convey the same to you.
Yours faithfully
A. W. Greig.
Laying aside old precedent and adopting a new procedure, the Society
at this meeting changed the written expression of Melbourne History, and
brought in a new era for Literary enterprize and expansion of thought.
A resume of my notes appeared in the Society’s Magazine for June, 1927
—not mine; they are too well written to be mine. Mr. Greig drafted them
from the information I compiled, and being modest, placed my name to
them to do me honour. As obsolete literature the Society passed out
“the last Sunday, 37” as first Sunday of Clow in the Settlement, without


apology, by showing he bought 400 feet of land in Swanston Street two
months before that.
“The Memoir of Hetherington” (pages 77-79) has doubtless been de-
pended on as being very accurate, whereas it is by no means precise.
Wilson says: “The history of Scots Church commences with the
year 1837.” The English of this is: the Church began when the year
began, for it commenced with it. Wilson misquotes Londsdale’s
statistics, using a 7 for a 2, and lands Clow in Melbourne, 25th December,
1837. That 7is clearly intended for a 6. This was the first author who
made the mistake, and all future authors copied him.
Draper said that Joseph Orton preached on Batman’s Hill on Sunday,
the 24th April, 1836. I have regarded this as a doubtful record—to
impart a species of renowm to Batman concerning whom so many
Fairy Tales were told. The thing is, what was the purpose of this
record? By whom was it made, and where was it preserved? Is it likely
a clergyman would visit an isolated place and there hold but one solitary
service at the door of Batman’s hut, before an audience of five people, and
then run away leaving it to a clergyman of ill-health to perform what
he could not do, viz., establish a Church? If this record can be estab-
lished, it belittles Orton.
The statement that he was the first clergyman in the Settlement was
not made until after Orton had left the Colonies. The statement that
Orton was in Melbourne before Clow was contained in an unpublished
letter to La Trobe, 20th March, 1854, by Dr. Thomson, hut the date of
Orton’s visit was not given by Thomson. William Londsdale saw the
reference in the letter, and challenged its accuracy (‘ Letters of the
Pioneers,” p. 253). Londsdale -was well qualified to know.
Thomson was proved by his contemporaries to be a wilful liar. He
said he built the first Church in the Settlement and finished it. Londsdale
said it was built by general subscription, and he, Londsdale, finished it.
Thomson said he was the first arbitrator, hut it was proved that Simpson
was. He said he discovered lake Colac, but it was Thomas Armitage who
first found it (“Letter to La Trobe,” p. 139). Thomson said he dis-
covered Lake Corangamite, but he travelled with a party, and Learmonth
says distinctly, as they were travelling they met a man who had already
seen the Lake, and he directed them to it (“Learmonth’s Letter,” p. 40 J.
On the frail testimony of this man a few writers have vainly endeavoured
to prove that Clow was not the first clergyman located in the Settlement.
As to who was first on the southern coast might be almost an endless
enquiry (see Hart’s Letter), but nothing can defeat the claim of the
Presbyterians to being first. Abel Tasman conducted Divine service
with his crew on the shore in Tasmania in 1642, and lasman was a
Presbyterian.
What does it matter who was first? With explorers first sight is the
end hoped for, but the aim of preaching is to achieve lasting results.
As an explorer the Good Samaritan was not first —the priest and Levite
were on the scene before him. But he was the first to make highest use
of the opportunity. As a clergyman Clow was the first that counts
in the Colonization of Victoria. The first to nail his colours to the
post. The first to remain and prove steadfast; and he that endures first
is first of all.
Orton visited Melbourne at a later date, preached for Rev. James Forbes, but made no
attempt to establish the Wesleyan Church. He was evidently confused by someone with
Clow, for it was mentioned he purchased land in Melbourne, but I investigated it and his
name does not appear on one of the original Titles.


The Patron Saint
I carved their names on the stones very rough; because that I was
not well used to the trade. I had not sufficient education to write
poetry; neither did I ever brag that I had, but I wrote something that I
called a rhyme, and this is how it runs: —
—From the Biography of Matthew Owain.
No field of learning had the Clows
Who toiled in flour mills —
Labourers indeed our country knows
Beside yon Ochil Hills.
Those hills of charm, and grandeur too,
They sheltered sons of God
Whose labours mingled the day through
With products of the sod.
Their day is spent, their race is run,
They both have come and gone;
Yet, mindful of the Victory won,
Their mills grind slowly on.
The Ochil Hills of lasting fame —
Its landscape is unchanged —
With silence speaks of those who came
And little plans arranged.
Here did ancestors of our Clow
Both nurse and comfort him;
The greatest man to-day we know —
Australia’s little Jim.
A genius from High did come
To Glow and Helen Gray.
He only had one perfect hand.
But that one held the day.
No battle chieftains were his sires
From Spanish terror fled.
The highest point of their desires
Was —live by making bread.
From Feddal home and Indee’s strand.
To Home and Hobart Town;
From whence he came to Batman’s land.
Then with us he set down.
His message borne by toil and love,
With truth and pain begun,
Was just the Gospel from above —
Pretentions he had none.
From Scotland’s soil and Indee’s clime.
And Melbourne too, to-day;
His voice will stand the test of time
While others pass away.
There’s fortune lost, and pleasure too,
To bring his life to light —
To labour days and long nights through,
■With money lost in sight.
But mills of God still grind the corn.
And toiler there must be.
The richest life requires my aid
To help posterity.
And Devotion has strong binding;
My task shall be unfurled —
The hand that continues grinding
Will always rule the world.




CHAPTER V. AND LAST.
The Prayer of India.
I feel that the same Grace and Help given to me on the voyage
will be mine to the end.
—Malcolm Clow, in the Macedonian Letters.
OMING now to the climax of this wonderful life, I will
proceed in my own way to relate it. My greatest support
in constructing this story has been William Moffat Clow,
High Sheriff, Portadown, Ireland, and it is unfortunate
that he and I have always differed on a very important
point in this history. My cousin is older than I am, and
should know the family history better; has also to his
advantage a superior scholarship. He says
When James Clow left India, January 27th, 1833, he never re-
turned to the Old Country at all, but went direct to Australia. I
can’t get it out of my head that, had James Clow returned to the
Old Country, my father, who w T as then 16 years old, would have
known of it, and talked of the event all the days of his life; whereas
he knew but little of him. He knew there was such a man and
that was all; and I never remember my uncle Peter (Peter Clow’s
son) speaking of him.
It is recorded at the India Office, London, that James Clow arrived in
England in May, 1833, but it is not recorded either in official or private
correspondence that anyone actually saw him in the Old Country after
he left India. The date of Isabella’s birth is uncertain, but it took
place at Edinburgh about this time. Would the mother be sent there
alone for that reason? After the departure from India Emma also was
born, but whether she was a twin, time, or place of her birth, will never
be known. I spent money on it with no result, which makes Tasmania
-—a place where there was no registration —suggestive. Even that
Isabella was born in Edinburgh rests on slender evidence; she said so
on an important occasion, but it is not on record in Edinburgh. I tried
to learn where Clow drew his pension during that period, but his move-
ments cannot he traced by that. It was paid through Forbes & Co. We
have had all the newspaper files of 1833-7 of Glasgow, Edinburgh, and all
the records of those twm places, and Kirkcaldy, searched, with no re-
sults. The Bombay portrait, however, is very puzzling —could that have
been executed in Hobart or Sydney? If so, the doctrine that James
Clow came from Scotland to Australia has nothing to support it.
On the other hand, if he actually visited the Old Land, his stay must
have been brief for his sojourn and departure to have transpired un-
noticed. This man who makes impressions and records everywhere makes
on this occasion none on a most impressionable place. If (as Wilson
affirms) he learned of Batman’s discovery in Hobart, it supports the view
that he was not in. England after India, or that he left it before Batman’s
letter reached the Record Office, then he sailed about August, 1835.
As there is nothing authentic to establish this, the story can only be
worked out by conjecture. The Clows had reason to remember Spain,
and there was a great incident in Spanish Literature, and a series of
events arose that may have awakened and impressed it on Clow’s mind.
“Isabella,” the Queen, befriended Columbus, who, in “three small ships,”
sailed in “August” “to find a new way to India.”
There is a tradition that associates Clow’s coming to Australia with
three ships. I got Clive Lord, of the Royal Society of Tasmania, to
trace out the shipping records. The result shows three ships came to-
gether, and arrived Hobart in 1836. February 16, “Margaret Graham,”


305 tons; Capt. J. Hamilton. The next day, 17th, the “North Briton,”
403 tons; Capt. T. Fayle. The “Janet,” 238 tons; Capt. D. Leitch. It
cannot be ascertained from the description as to who were aboard.
Wilson says the “North Briton” conveyed to Australia Revs. Clow, Lillie,
Tail and ‘Hamilton, but (he says) that it was in 1837. But Hamilton
became Clow’s son-in-law, and had he been a pioneer of equal standing
with Clow I would have known of it. The “North Briton” did arrive
again in Hobart, 7th Sept., 1837. The Rev. J. Heyer examined the pas-
senger list for me, for that occasion, and it shows it was Robert Clow
not James Clow that was aboard, 1837. R. Clow was a different man
altogether. He was born at Middlebie, 1796; his father was Thomas
Clow and his mother Janet Thompson. He died in Melbourne, 1865.
He was the father of a large family. One of his sons added an “e” to
his name, and where the name “Clowe” is met with, they are the des-
cendants of this man.
The earlier presence of James Clow on Australian shores is easily
established.
ON 29th MAY, 1836,
there arrived in Hobart, direct from Bombay, the “Tigris.” It belonged
to the East India Company and chartered as “cruizing.” 260 tons
burthen; commanded by Captain Igglesden. This was the boat that
contained goods and building material for James Clow, consigned
through Forbes and Co. As the East India Company took no part in the
occupation of Australia, apart from establishing James Clow, the 29th
of May, 1936 should be observed as the Centennial of the Presbyterian
Church of Victoria, for it perpetuates the memory of the Company that
moulded and sustained the man who was honoured of God to perform
the task of planting it, and it is the only reliable date that will ever
be known in connection with it.
When James Clow first came to Melbourne will never be known, but
from evidence I will furnish hereafter, his first landing in Port Phillip
may have occurred any time after 15th March, 1836. He preached first
in the open-air. His first Gospel service was held “on the bank of
the Yarra.” I am not in doubt about this, for it was verified to me
when I was a child by old pioneers. The site was near where St. Paul’s
now is, but was altered in later years to make the Flinders Street Rail-
way Station. I have no knowledge of what took place at the service or
what form the meeting took. My informants were so very old, and
I was so young that it is but little I can recollect of what they told
me, but to commemorate the event suitable readings would be: 1 Sam.
iii, 1-10; Acts xx, 17-35.
In memory of the day, I wrote a few lines, which I called the
“Inaugui’al Hymn”:—
The saints and sons of God who rise,
To dwell in this fair land,
If brief we be as time that flies,
Will learn we took our stand.
(Chorus.)
And men like Batman of renown
Extol divinity.
They bless with us this Melbourne town
This little town we see.
Their labours too, may come and go,
But one thing will remain—
If some may reap what we now sow,
The truth we still proclaim.
The footprints that we make this day
Will show where we have trod.
This ground, to those who pass this way,
Will bear them on to God.
‘Westwood’s Diary, page 166, says “Mr. Hamilton informs me that he was one of the
first ministers in the bush of the Presbyterian church.” Had he accompanied Rev. Jas.
Clow he would have been equal to a city first.

THE PACIFIC EMPIRE.


Thou Jesus, blessed Saviour, King,
All humble men are we;
But bless our voices while we sing
All glory unto Thee.
And Melbourne—O most gracious God —
This place that we now see:
The finest land the saints have trod —-
We consecrate to Thee.
In September, 1836, Londsale came to Port Phillip and prepared a
schedule of statistics of those who were already settled when he came.
If Clow was there then he was either included in Swanston’s party or in
the “Government Establishment.” The use of the term “Establishment”
is like Indian phrasing. When he landed, Lonsdale says Dr. Thomson
came to him with a brace of pistols and said he was pleased he had come
on account of the lawlessness of the place. But Londsdale says the only
evidence of lawlessness he saw was —he tacked a notice on a tree and
someone tore it down. The hint is, he suspected Thomson of being the
culprit.
What Port Phillip Settlement was like in 1836 is well described by
John Hepburn in his Letter to La Trobe, page 48. He, in company with
Gardiner and Hawdon, were the first party to make the overland journey
from Sydney to Melbourne. He says:—
We arrived about 4 p.m., but Mr. H., having overshot the mark,
did not arrive until 9 p.m. His horse being quite done up. There
were only a few huts in the Settlement —Buckley was the first man
I saw. One hut was occupied by a Mr. Batman; one by Dr. Thomson
—somewhere near where the Prince of Wales now stands. The
other huts were only slabs stuck in the ground, forming a roof and
covered with earth. One little wooden box belonging to Strachan
stood where the Western Market is now, and the Old Lamb Inn was
building, hut no accommodation was to be had for money. This was
December, 1836.
This would be the time the Scots Church began. Nor am I alone in
that conclusion. In a letter to me, Nora Wilkie says:—
The great-grandfather established the first Scots Church in Mel-
bourne about 1836.
When I produce evidence to show that her father and grandfather
held the same view, it will be verified, but just here I cannot give further
attention to this point. I have some other matters of spiritual im-
portance I wish to emphasise. Space is precious, and the worry of
whether, for lack of money, I will be able to get published as much as I
have said, is heavy upon me, so I had better abbreviate.
There is, however, something that should be noticed. In the little
volume belonging to the Presbytery of Kirkcaldy, Scotland, which con-
tains the signatures of ministers signing the Confession of Faith since
1755, there is the following entry:—
Kirkcaldy, 18th April, 1815, Mr. James Clow signed the above
Confession of Faith as the Confession of his faith on his being
ordained to the office of the ministry. JAMES CLOW.
This record indicates the whole life story of Clow. I can express a
volume in three words —he pursued it. This reveals how he proceeded
to organize Scots Church, Melbourne. His actions in Doutta Galla
would be similar to what he did in planting the Church in Bombay.
The Lord’s Supper would he the first institution attended to. The
Lord’s command enjoined it, and the Bourke Act, passed sth August,
1836, would render it legally important, so that they may obtain
right to celebrate their own marriages. Clow was seemingly several
times in the Settlement before he rested, so that his efforts there at
first may not have been continuous as happened in Bombay.
I cannot here help noticing again the prayer of the Elders when he
was about to leave that place:—


The Session express their sympathy in the dispensation which
has led to the event, and that Mr. Clow be requested to accept their
sincere thanks for his long and faithful and affectionate pastoral
service in the Church of Bombay, and their earnest prayer that,
wherever in the course of Divine Providence he may he carried, the
best blessing of Almighty God may rest upon him, and that he may
he long spared in health and strength to he useful to his family
and to the society in which his lot may he cast.
There are, as I previously pointed out, very unique features in this.
We will see how it works out. Under the pastoral care of Clow, Scots
Church was planted, and it became the greatest centre of the Presby-
terian Church outside Scotland. Indeed, even in Glasgow, the Church
of Scotland is no more strongly entrenched. Did the prayer of India
produce this result? Adelaide, Sydney, and Brisbane all received
Scotch emigrants, and had cultured pastors. Why did they not have
the same results? Because the Elders prayed that “the best blessing
of Almighty God may rest upon him.” And the proof of it is still
visible in our own generation. The Church began in Collins Street
west, but it removed east. No matter the chronological inferences
taken from the famous paragraphs in Bonwick and McCombie, it is
nevertheless clear that they record Clow as the preacher of Melbourne
for more than twelve months before Forbes arrived.
On Ist November, 1837, Clow purchased four blocks of land having
a frontage of 475 feet to Swanston and 400 feet to Londsdale Streets.
This gives no idea as to when Clow first saw this site, for Batman and
Swanston —who were founders of Melbourne —purchased their land in
the same street on the same day. The extraordinary thing, however,
about this is that Clow was able to construct a pretentious edifice on
bis site that was the subject of comment for twenty years —which neither
of those other two men could do.
Intellectual able-bodied men could not excel him in anything he
did —-surely it was the hand of God. The man who builds a house for
himself in twelve months is not idle, but the man of physical handicap,
with a large family, who accomplished this to the admiration of his
fellow-citizens, achieved something that staggers me. Clow’s house
had a steep roof in which there were three dormer windows. It bore
some pretence to ornamentation. It had upstair rooms, and a verandah
in front. I do not know the origin of the following note, but it seems
like a quotation from Arden’s book, with something added by the
quotator:—
The Settlement presenting more the appearance of a village in
the centre of India than a collection of European houses. To this
Indian aspect the Rev. James Clow, who first gathered the Presby-
terians together in Melbourne as a congregation, contributed some-
thing, for when he came finally with his family and belongings
from Tasmania in a fleet of three schooners, he lirought with him
the materials for a bungalow to which style of building he was
partial because of his experience as a Chaplain in India.
Clow could not take a settled charge as a pastor because he was in
receipt of a pension. He possibly had already filled the position re-
gularly as long as he could with any degree of safety. In January,
1838, Revd. James Forbes, M.A., arrived in Melbourne, and Clow urged
him to take up the work at Scots Church. On 22nd June of that year
Clow occupied the chair of a congregation meeting to extend a formal
call to Mr. Forbes to the pastorate. James Clow, Skene Craig, Peter
Snodgrass, William Ryrie, and Thomas Napier were the Trustees. In
the month of August following. Clow went to Dandenong, which is
situated about twenty miles to the east of Melbourne, to occupy a cattle
station.
This was again another hazardous enterprize with more peril than
prospect attached to it, but it worked out all right. Still, humanly
speaking, what was there to recommend such a move? I know as
much about the land as any one average man is likely to know. If the
full story of the land settlement were told, it would be that it has
broken a great many more than it has made. For a young man who is


strong, and knows what he is about, it means years of steadfastness,
isolation, and endurance, but it presents a fair prospect. To a frail
man, however, with just a large family of girls, what was there to
commend it? Clow w'as the first original settler in Dandenong. At the
time he went out there, he was surrounded by the wild aborigines.
There was no such thing as winning the safe confidence of the wild
blacks. He might come home some night to find the whole household
murdered —such happened to many of the settlers. Judging from his
Letter to La Trobe, even Clow himself appears to have been deceived
as to the true character of the natives. While praising one black-
fellow, he appears to be unaware of the fact that the same fellow was
a dangerous man-eater. Yet the prayer of India: “Wherever in the
course of Divine Providence he may he carried,” still holds, and where
he built the town sprang up, and proof that the prayer was heard is
evidenced by his name on the lamp-posts to-day.
From the description he gives of his run. Clow must have occupied
about forty thousand acres, but it is possible that of this he would
only make about five thousand acres freehold. The rest would in time
revert to the crown. He called the name of his homestead Tirhatuan.
It was adjacent to the junction of the Narrewong and Dandenong creeks.
Clow also held the cattle run known as Corhan-Warrabul because the
blacks called the mountain by that name, which formed the north-
eastern boundary of it. Clow took a lively interest in cattle-i’aising
and cultivation, and his place prospered. Yet the soul of the man was
too large to be wholly occupied by what was immediately around him.
He frequented Melbourne, and was ever alert to improvements for it.
The School of Arts and the Mechanics’ Institute was founded as one
institution in November, 1839. Captain Londsdale was the president,
and Rev. James Clow is mentioned, first in order, among the vice-presi-
dents, and his son-in-law, Dr. Wilkie, was the first Librarian, and
gathered together the first museum. This was the beginning of that
mighty institution which is to-day the Public Library and Museum of
Melbourne, and is now one of the greatest institutions of its kind in the
world. Nor is this all. It is but the fringe of some of the magnificent
movements he set on foot.
A Society came together in Victoria called “The Pastoral and Agricul-
tural Society,” and they held their inaugural dinner on 16th January,
1840, and the Rev. James Clow is mentioned first in order among the
Directors. Under their direction the first show and exhibition was held
in March, 1840. Since then the annual show of cattle and agricultural
exhibition in Victora has never missed. The Elders of Romhay prayed
for “the society in which his lot may be cast.” How do you account
for it?
The'first public meeting of the settlers to consider ways and means
of water supply in Melbourne was held in the Lamb Inn Hotel on 25th
May 1840. The Rev. James Clow presided. It was desired to form a
“Water Works Company” with a capital of £20,000. A provisional com-
mittee was elected, and an honorary secretary. To this a recent writer
argued it bore no bearing to the final result, but we know that no great
public move is ever carried out by one group of men. It was at this
meeting the idea was sown which finally grew to a greater one. It is
strange the term “water-works” became an idiom peculiar to Melbourne.
In the other States, for something similar, they said “irrigation,” “water
scheme,” or “water supply.” This finally developed into the Yan Yean,
and even in my time men employed on it called it “The Water-works.”
Perhaps I might stop here, for I am mentally worn out with the long
strain associated with research, and my hand is tired, but I can see a
few more important matters to which a brief reference should be made.
My father came into the .service of James Clow, but he was not a Clow.
His right name was Armstrong. He married the widow of James Clow’s
nephew William Clow, so that I am not of the Rlood Royal. For the
sake of this Eiography it was well that Providence arranged it so, for
had I been a blood relation of my subject, I would possibly have felt a
shyness in referring to his many fine qualities, which may have ham-
pered me. My grandfather owned a station in the same district as
Clow, and they frequently met and conversed. Charles Wale Sherard, in


his Letter to La Trobe, mentions my grandfather. Commencing from
Western Port Bay and proceeding towards Melbourne, he mentions
Massie and Anderson’s, and then says on page 36: —
. At that period, viz., 1841-43, a considerable quantity of wild cattle
was running in the neighbourhood, supposed to have been the in-
crease of some that were left when the original settlement was
abandoned. About two miles from them was Armstrong, who suc-
ceeded John Thom, who succeeded Massie and Anderson. About
five miles from Armstrong were Cuthbert and Gardiner (original
settlers), whose cattle I piloted myself from the Red Bluff.
As he proceeds he mentions the station of “the Rev. Mr. Clow,” and
says it was situate between the Blacks’ Station and Mrs. Scott’s. While
he was yet a boy my father was a great deal on Tirhatuan station, yet
he knew nothing of William Clow, which seems to suggest that if
William was ever there it must have been before 1841. At that rate, he
must have left Scotland when he was very young, but traditional in-
formation says he was a grown man when he left the Old Country. Was
he ever in the company of James Clow? If not, how did he come to be
possessed of the vast amount of accurate knowledge of him? Poor
William. He accomplished nothing for himself, but he was, neverthe-
less, an important factor in the construction of this narrative. Indeed,
had he not lived, the record could never have been compiled. And
then I do not think I would have bothered with it only for the affection
mother bore him. The nephew of the Rev. Irving Hetherington said to
me: “What good will the publication of the Rev. James Clow’s Biography
ever do you?”
“But the Saviour’s, Come ye blessed.
All our labours will repay.”
Now I will shut out as much as I can, and conclude with a few his-
torical facts. The following is a copy of the Marriage Certificate of
James Forbes:—
New South Wales. Presbyterian Marriages Solemnized
in the Parish of Melbourne, in the County of Bourke, in the
year 1845.
No. 230.
I, the Rev. James Forbes, do hereby declare that I am a
member of, or hold Communion with, the Presbyterian
Church of Scotland.
JAMES FORBES.
I, Helen Johanna Clow', do hereby declare that I am a
member of, or hold Communion with, the Presbyterian
Church of Scotland.
HELEN J. CLOW.
I, the Revd. James Clow, of Tirhatuan, Minister of the
Church of Scotland, do hereby certify that the Revd. James
Forbes, M.A., of Melbourne, Bachelor, and Helen Johanna
Clow, of , Spinster, were joined together in Wedlock by
me on the fifteenth day of April, 1845, at Tirhatuan, in the
presence of David Elliot Wilkie, M.D., and Mary E. Wilkie,
both of Melbourne, and others.

David E. Wilkie, M.D. Jane Clow.

Observe the Marriage Lines of those days gave very little information,
and there was no public registration of clergymen or marriages as is the
case now. A man might be born, married, dead, and buried, and no
record of it. This will show how difficult my task has been to follow


the trail. Compulsory registration began in India, but it did not come
into operation in the Colonies until 1856, and did not extend to Ireland
until 1864. Had the registration of a marriage celebrant been then in
force, we could have learned from it when James Clow began as such
in Melbourne; hut there is no such record in Sydney—l had the files
searched. Historians frequently mention what is in the Statistician
Office, hut they have nothing there earlier than 1856, except what was
carried to them voluntarily, at some later date. If in need of any
information prior to that, a man might as well compose it himself as
place any reliance on the Government Statist for it. Forbes’ marriage
was not registered until 1881, and many births and marriages of that
period are not registered yet.
There is an old record that speaks of “Mrs. Clow and her charming
and beautiful daughters.” Commenting on this in a letter to me, Miss
Wilkie says:—
“And from their old photographs, they were, some of them, beautiful.
And were greatly looked up to and admired in the society of those days.”
Miss Wilkie was writing like I am, under a feeling of depression, and
was looking back on a glory that once vested the family but had now
faded away. Never mind, Nora, you and I missed it. Just as well we
did, for if w 7 e had been there then we would not have been here now.
In 1843, 474 ministers and a multitude of people separated themselves
from the Church in Scotland. It was caused over the question of free
selection of the pastor by the congregation, and State aid. News of this
did not reach Australia for some time, and then for a while Australia
hesitated to commit herself on the matter, and then the Synod ot
Sydney wisely decided in favour of neutrality. Fortunately the mails
were slow in~those days, and twelve months passed in getting the de-
cision of New South Wales to Scotland and in obtaining a reply, ihe
answer was that neither the Established nor the Free Church of Scot-
land would fraternise with Australia while she remained neutral, and
then slowly the break began to come.
As w r e look on the Marriage Certificate of Forbes, we might easily
have thought that this young couple would be happily placed in Scots
Church for fifty years—no others were so much entitled to it. But
it was not to be, for they were soon hurled into calamity. In this hte
nothing is safe or assured. Within eighteen months of his marriage
Forbes met the Assembly and laid his protest on the table against State
aid The Assembly was ready for him, and immediately carried a resolu-
tion that: The Rev James Forbes, M.A., is no longer a minister of the
Presbyterian Church. This was swift movement. The proper way to
have met it would have been for Forbes to have camped in the Churcn
until the Assembly returned to their senses—there was no authority
that could have put him out. ,
But the poor fellow, being borne up by a youthful courage, and ca -
ried away with a crazy idea that was world-wide, forsook the Church
that had been erected under his own guidance, and its beautiful sur-
roundings, left his manse, surrendered his salary, and went out on the
road for the sake of principle. Shakespeare knew nothing of the sub-
ject when he said, “Conscience makes cowards of us all. It never
made a coward of Forbes: but, all the same, I don t think the principle
was worth the sacrifice. , ,
Forbes left Scots Church on 28th October, 1846, and with a mere hand-
ful of friends, he met in the Mechanics’ Hall and feebly endeavoured to
organize the “Free” Presbyterian cause. The result of this division was
that in a short time, there were nine different sects of Presbyterians
in Melbourne, meeting in different centres, pouring into each other a
fire of abuse. Nor was this any spasmodic effort. With an energy
that threatened never to exhaust itself, it continued so tor years, until
the Church of Scotland became the laughing-stock of ttie whole
C °Meanwhile, Dandcnong commercially forged ahead, and aft airs on the
two great cattle stations Clow had established occupied so much of his
attention that he had little time for else. Some of his daugh ers
married. Two of his children died, and his only remaining son had
begun to strike out for himself. After having occupied Corhan-Warrabul


for twelve years, in 1850 Clow sold it to Bcilby. He then disposed of
lirhatuan, and a little later seemed to have a thought to settle down
to a quiet life in Melbourne. Clow came out of Dandenong to an advan-
tage ot £150,000. Though well over sixty, retired and pensioned, Clow
was again sought out and pressed into service.
In the meantime James Forbes achieved a little success, but it was
onl ™° derate one. He laid bis protest on the table of the Assembly
on 9th October, 1846. After gathering a few followers together in the
Mechanics Hall, he succeeded in raising sufficient public subscriptions
to erect a beautiful little chapel opposite the Public Library, which was
called the John Knox Church.” This was in 1847,* and there, on 9th
June, with two other ministers, he drew up a constitution for the Free
Synod of Victoi ia, but it advanced very little. Forbes really overtaxed
his strength, and he died a martyr of the Disruption, 12th August, 1851
He was 37. On his epitaph it could have been said: “For the sake of
principle he surrendered all, even to his very existence.”
The heath of Forbes cast a gloom over matters, and caused men to
think. Clow was asked to exert his influence to reunite the different
sections of the Church. The secretarial work fell upon Irving Hethering-
ton, and he sent for Clow to co-operate with him. They managed to
gather together representatives of the three chief sections of the divisions,
but matters proceeded very slowly. Forbes’ congregation stood out, so’
Clow thought it best not to disturb them, hut to proceed with those who
felt disposed to join in. Prospects for union for a time seemed hope-
less. A preliminary Conference was held in 1854. At this meeting Clow
was asked to lead the gathering in prayer for union. He did so, but
still union was delayed.
Clow was filling preaching appointments, and of one section was
elected Moderator in 1856, and while in office he made a supreme effort
before the Synod on 3rd December. In an address, he took for his
text. Holding forth the word of life” (Phil, ii, 16). In this he stressed
one great point that the Church was to hold forth—not to hold hack.
This is a portion of Clow’s discourse:—
The principal instrument by which this great end is to he attained
th( : J word of God - Tlle Holy Scriptures containing the books of
the old and new Testaments are the only rule which God has given
to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him. Accordingly these
are described by St. Paul as able to make men wise unto salvation
through iaith in Christ Jesus. If then we would co-operate with
God in saving precious sinners the most effectual method we can
adopt is to hold forth to them his own word—to present it to them
m every possible way in which we conceive, their attention to its
great truths, and their compliance with its fundamental requisitions
are most likely to be secured.
It is a most cruel and inexcusable crime to with hold from the
people the word of life. It is depriving them of the principal means
which God has ordained for their eternal salvation, and it is doing
this not only without any warrant from the Scripture, or reason but
in direct opposition to the evident declarations and conclusions of
both. The duty comprehended in the text incontrovertihly is not
to hold back hut to hold forth the word of life. To allege the
necessity ot tradition as supplementary to the inspired volume, or
necessary to the right interpretation of it, is to charge the word of
God with incompetency.—lt is to censure the conduct of the Son of
God, lor he, who spake as never man spake, in discoursing to the
mixed multitudes that thronged around him used no interpreter; but
addressed them direct, and his words, as narrated by the inspired
historians in the absence of every restriction whatever in the divine
record itself must, according to every principle of fair reasoning be
still considered as addressed to all his disciples.
Efforts for union were again renewed, and a basis of union was arrived
at by the close of 1858, and on 7th April, 1859, the four chief divisions
*lt says so in record. Ido not quite understand it fir the Foundation Stone of
John Knox Church was laid November 17th, 1847.


met in their own respective Synods for the last time. They drew up and
read their concluding minutes at noon, and then all went to'Scots
Church where they were solemnly constituted “The Presbyterian Church
of Victoria.” The four Moderators, representing the uniting Synods,
took part in devotional service, and the union was completed, and they
celebrated the Lord’s Supper together. The record says;—
The Rev. James Clow, the venerable pioneer of the Kingdom in
Port Phillip, was unanimously elected first Moderator of the United
Church.
The same day, at evening, a great public meeting was held in the
Exhibition Building, and James Clow occupied the chair. He did a little
preaching after this, but this was a glorious climax to a wonderful
life He retired to a place at Oak Hill, Queenscliff, where the year 186
passed quietly away. The union left a few clergymen and congregations
behindhand Jmong the few that remained out was Forbes congregation.
Except that they could get a preacher of exceptional talent (and they
hS no inducement to offer to attract such), or unless they could gam
the sympathy of some very influential men, they only had a slender
chance of continuance.
On the 15th March, 1861, Clow was working in his garden when the
call came, and he dropped down dead.
“He stood erect with heavenly pinions on,
Dressed to the flight, and ready to be gone.
On 19th March he was buried in the Melbourne Gc^ ]
remember a gentleman named Farren, who was a bank an
well acquainted with James Clow. Farren had a very large, black, bushy
betrd He met my people a great deal, and often conversed with them
about' Clow. On one occasion, referring to the incident of his death,
mother said:
“What killed him?” . n 011
Farren said, “Nothing killed him—he just died, that was all. He was
very old, and he died because he thought it was unnecessary to live any
longer.” , . 0 „
Mother enquired, “Was he in good circumstances.
Farren took a deep breath, paused for a second, then proceeded
thoughtfully, “He was rich; he was a very rich man; he didn t know tne
end of his money.”
As a matter of fact, when Clow died, his estate was worth about four
hundred thousand pounds. To the clergy who say they do not believe
in the miracles of the Bible, Clow is an effective answer His whole
life was a miracle. He stands out on his own as one of the most extra-
ordinary men that ever lived. He was not an imitator but an origina-
tor. That explains him being first, and in the advance in many things.
Under his influence the great Presbyterian Church of Victoria pre-
sented an unbroken front to the world thirty years before the Chinch
became united in Scotland. That he should only have one hand was
decreed in heaven to furnish a lesson to the world. There is not an-
other case in history where a man, similarly situated from birth, ac-
complished what he did. Some may say, “Opportunity ; but m every
opportunitv that he had, I have shown that the chances were against
him, and how he did it will not submit to human reasoning. It was
God’ Who performed it. ~ ,
After attending the funeral—on the same day, m case it would he
required—the Hon David Wilkie, M.D., M.L.C., filed a Document. He
said he was son-in-law to the deceased whose father’s name was James
Clow, of Stirling, Scotland, and his mother Helen Gray, and his wife
Margaret Morison. This establishes the identity of the man we have
followed all the way through. Seeing, however, that the life of Clew
was so vast, we could hardly suppose that he could there and then
compose a Document that could withstand criticism in the light of
research. Only a marvel could have done it. But the attempt he made
is very serviceable. Just taking round numbers he said Clow was
twenty-three years in the Colony. Taking a hurried glance at it, from
beginning 1837 to close 1860 (dropping the fraction) looks like twenty-


three years, whereas it was twenty-four. Taking twenty-three, how-
ever, as his base of calculation, he names all Clow’s children —giving
their ages, and in every case, where we can prove their age, he is more
than a year out. To the same extent he is wrong as to the duration of
his stay in Bombay, and concluded by saying that Clow was 69 years
old, whereas he was 70 years, 10 months. 'This undesigned
evidence shows where the “last Sunday, ‘37’ ” date lands you. It
throws all the records of Bombay, London, and Edinburgh a year out.
Dr. Wilkie’s son was a barrister. I was constantly in his company
for about nineteen years. He said that James Clow was offered
£lOO,OOO for his property in Londsdale Street, and refused it. A man
is very rich who can refuse a hundred thousand pounds.
Forbes’ principles did not perish, although his congregation died out;
but it took another body of people to establish them. They struggled
on till 1874 and then gradually began to fade away, until the Trustees
of John Knox Chapel locked them out in the street. Even then a
number of devoted souls who had loved Forbes gathered around the
building to which they could no longer gain admission. But Providence
arranges all things well. In Church History (Stewart, page 26), Forbes
is spoken of as the man who, at the bidding of the voice of conscience,
went out into the wilderness. Strange to say a party called Christians,
three years after Forbes’ death, commenced in Melbourne where he
began—the Mechanics’ Hall. It seems appropriate that a man in the
wilderness should precede the Christians —like New Testament pro-
cedure. All the principles Forbes contended for they adopted, liberal-
ized, and gave to them a wider application. Thus Forbes renounced
State aid. His successors established a Gospel meeting, and took up
no public offering. Forbes refused to recognize the Established Church.
His successors went beyond that, and renounced denominational names
entirely. Wherever Forbes trod they trod, and travelled on with an
ever-advancing freedom of expansion.
Following his trail, when Forbes’ Chapel fell into disuse, the Chris-
tians purchased it, and it became their home. In the metropolis and
suburbs they now number 10,000, and they have ideas of Union which
their religious neighbours seem afraid to discuss. To even make the
oddity more significant, Forbes issued the first religious paper in the
settlement called “The Christian Herald,” and the people who advanced
him established the “Christian,” which, to-day, is the most widely read
religious magazine in the Commonwealth. It seems appropriate that
the “Christian Herald” should precede the “Christian.”
Now, respecting the other members of the family. The Ballan Shire
kindly assisted me, and appointed Mr. James H. Walsh, an old resident,
to compile a statement which is as follows: — _
James Maxwell Clow’s name appears in the “Squatters’ Directory”
for 1849 as the occupant for the Pine Plain run, in the Wimmera Dis-
trict. It was situated about fifty miles from Lake Hindmarsh, and sixty
miles from the Murray. Clow (junior) obtained the lease of it 23rd
August, 1847. The estimated area of this run was 45,000 acres, and
the grazing capacity 10,000 sheep. For a mere trifle he sold the lease
in 1849. But another place, between that and Lake Hindmarsh, which
he got in May, 1847, he retained for a long time, and in his Letters to
La Trobe, he gives some blood-thrilling accounts of the Aboriginals. He
had a rich literary gift, and the pity is that he did not write more.
In 1856, however, something better than the life of a squatter presented
itself, and he wisely accepted it. On the sth May of that year he was
appointed Resident Magistrate of Egerton, Steiglitz, and Ballan, and nine
days later was appointed chairman of the local court. It was a nice
little job, and the position was worth £BOO a year. He was removed
from there, 1857, to another district, but returned to Ballan again, 1865,
and continued in the same position until September, 1871, when he en-
tered a retired life. He had a son named Eric; what became of him is
not known. And here the male line of the Rev. James Clow ends.
For years I was much confused as to who James Maxwell Clow was.
He is the nearest modern approach to Melchizedek that I know of—hav-
ing neither beginning of days nor end of life. I discovered what might


be the explanation that there is no record of his birth. At first, all
such records were stored in the Government offices at Bombay. An
energetic clerk was appointed, who took it upon himself to tidy his
office, and when doing so he burnt all the records of births, marriages,
and deaths, thinking they were of no further use. This occurred in
1821. After this the Government issued instructions that a separate
record was to he filed in all the Churches. More cannot be written of
this man than I have here produced, for there is no more to be said.
What confused me was a statement I got when I was ten years old
—that James Clow’s son died during the voyage from India. I think
this statement correctly told should have been, “The father ot James
Clow died while the son was on the voyage from India.” I either im-
perfectly heard or I was imperfectly informed. However, it is clear to
me now that he had two sons; Henry died at nineteen.
Emma married Archihland McArthur Campbell on 28th September,
1852 He took up a station on the Murray, and wrote one ot the
“Letters of the Pioneers.” Indeed, study that volume well out, and it
is clear that many of Clow’s friends took a hand in it. Emma died at
twenty-three.
Margaret married the Rev. William Hamilton. All that is known ot
him appears in a few brief references in the Diary of Joseph Westwood,
Baptist Minister. He said he had a nice farm and an interesting family
of sons and daughters at Mortlake. This is all that ever will be known.
They grew up, scattered, and were lost sight of. In this world man is
never settled, though he often thinks he is: man is always travelling on.
Isabella, on 25th March, 1856, married William Corbet James Parry,
and they went to the Old Country and lived m Wales. Jane mained
Dr Robertson. I never heard the descendants speaking ot him. from
this I conclude, either he removed to a foreign land or died i young. In
the old cemetery, Melbourne, there was a grave, No. 98, a
with a headstone, and these were the only words upon it:—John Robert-
son, M.D., 13th September, 1852, aged 24. This possibly refers to him.
All the descendants shared equally in the division of Clow’s estate
and some of the descendants of the next generation married men of
title. His widow died on 7th January, 1872, and Forbes & Co ” .’
who did much business for him while in India, acted as Trustees for th
portion of Clow’s estate that was beyond the seas. My task is finished-
I have now accounted for James Clow and all his chi l ( l t ',
held nothing: I withdraw nothing. Every likely field where mforma
Hon might be stored I have investigated. In that respect no more can
be done. Yet I am conscious that many inspiring lessons may and
be drawn from this history that I have not made mam es
that fully requires greater mental power than I possess, but it w
To peruse the spiritual expositions of the righteous upon this work is
a pleasure I look forward to, and that their efforts in worthy comment
will exceed in brilliance my dull attempts is an easy certainty. Neverthe-
less I will have the comfort of knowing I gathered the material for the
more skilful artisan to garnish with rhetoric resplendence which I left
in a bare form.
After having travelled Australia, I came to Canberra to establish a
Library. Mr. Edmund Hopkins drove me all over the Federal Territory.
This was in 1923. There were no houses of accommodation then in
Canberra. A few brick cottages were in course of construction where
Kingston now stands, and the builders of these were dwelling in tents,
and Parliament House was not commenced. Queanbeyan, now a suburb,
was an old town six miles off. This suited me well, and there I set
down in Hayes Street. While Parliament House was being erected, 1
was building my Library. When Parliament House was finished the
English Government sent for it a “Speaker’s Chair” made from the tim-
ber of Nelson’s ship, “The Victory.” I think a “Chair” made from
Cook’s ship, “The Endeavor,” would have been more appropriate, tor
James Cook’s career has more bearing on Australian History than that
of Nelson. The term “Endeavor” more fittingly describes Canberra
than the word “Victory.” Still, this is but a thought by the way, but
something peculiarly coincident with this occurred.


The Bombay Government, not knowing what the English Government
had done, but hearing of my Library, singularly conceived the idea of
making an inkstand for it. This they made out of one of the old pews
that was in St. Andrew’s Church when James Clow was pastor of it,
and the inkstand was made at an Industrial Orphanage connected with
the Church, and the Bombay Government sent it to me. I was informed
of its coming, and when it arrived, we had a little ceremony which took
place in the Clow-Library at 3.30 p.m., 22nd February, 1927. The meet-
ing took the form of a Session, the Rev. C. Caldwell Wearne acting as
Moderator. There were also present Messrs. R. J. Clow, R. Hetherington,
F. M. Edwards, F. W. Morison, and Alderman J. W. Sproule.
The meeting opened with prayer in the course of which Mr. Wearne
said: “Lord, we thank Thee for the life of him whom we this day
remember.”
The chairman then called upon Messrs. Sproule and Edwards to examine
the writing on the correspondence, and compare it with the written
address on the parcel and certify that they were similar. This they
did. He then asked Mr. Hetherington to remove the seals on the regis-
tered parcel, open it, and present the contents to Mr. Clow.
The inkstand was enfolded in many wrappings. They were removed,
and presenting the gift to Mr. Clow, Mr. Hetherington said: —
On behalf of the Government and Christian friends in Bombay, it
gives me pleasure to present you with this inkstand which was made
from one of the old pews of St. Andrew’s Church Fort. I am sure it will
he ever treasured and highly valued by you.
Mr. Clow stood up and thankfully received it from Mr. Hetherington,
and when doing so, gave an outline of the history of the Presbyterian
Cause in India.
Mr. Morison and Mr. Edwards each spoke, and Alderman Sproule read
some newspaper appreciations of the Rev. James Clow.
The Chairman: “Would Mr. Hetherington like to speak again? I under-
stand Mr. Hetherington’s uncle buried the Rev. James Clow, but I don’t
know when it was.”
Mr. Clow: “It was 19th March, 1861.”
The Chairman; “Mr. Clow is good on dates. I only know one date in
history, myself; that was ‘Ten Hundred and Sixty-six.’ I think that was
when Queen Anne died.”
Mr. Hetherington: “Are you sure that was not the time of the fire in
London?”
Mr. Hetherington, then rising from his seat, said: “I do not wish to
hurry the meeting through, for when Mr. Clow begins to talk on history,
I could listen to him all day. It is singular that Mr. Clow and I should
meet in this town. We came together accidentally at first, and afterwards
we frequently met and conversed, until we discovered who we both were.
In the early days of which we are thinking, the pioneer ministers did
not then do as is the custom now—to wait for a ‘call.’ They simply
went out like the squatters and took up a lease. A few years ago I
went to Melbourne, and visited Scots Church, which was established by
the Rev. James Clow, and of which my uncle afterwards became the
pastor. Without doubt it is to-day one of the greatest Churches in
Austral-Asia.”
At 4.40 p.m. the meeting closed with the Benediction.
Now, the thing is, which will have the greater influence on History?—
the Speaker’s Chair or the Inkstand? The Speaker’s Chair is supported
by 112 of the brightest intellects of the Continent, and behind them is
the entire Commonwealth. And behind the Inkstand there is nothing
but the inspiration of the lone hand, but we will “endeavour” to keep
our objective in sight.
Associated in thought with the “Speaker's Chair,” I have a letter which,
though not within the subject of this story, will be of public interest.
My grandfather was on hoard the “Victory” when Nelson was shot.
His story would be difficult to piece together, as there were many of the


same name in the Navy. Mother’s name was Edwards, and William
Hugh Edwards, of Bangor, a devoted cousin, who has done much for the
Clow-Library, sent me an unpublished letter of the Admiral’s, which I
give here: —
New York,
November 14th, 1782.
Pilford, —
Since I saw you yesterday, I have changed my mind about ap-
pointing Edwards as Boatswain, but will ask Lord Hood to give him
the boating on some other ship; this, I hope, will do as well. lam
to dine with the Admiral to-day, and very likely shall not be on
board till nine. Will you sup with me at ten? I will speak with
you about Ropanel whatever be done. My interest at Home, you
know, is next to nothing, the name of Nelson being little known. It
may be different one of those days; a good chance only is wanting
to make it so.
Yours sincerely.
Horatio Nelson.
The few last words are very impressive: “The name of Nelson being
little known: it may be different one of those days.”
Now a word in politics. The centre of Australia is a great interior far
removed from the seat of the Australian Parliaments, and for that reason
is neglected by them. The politician treats it as no man’s land. Had
Dickson been alert to the future interests of his Colony—as were the
other Premiers —he would have demanded some concession for Queens-
land before joining the Federation. He asked nothing, and to Queens-
land nothing was given. For National reasons, however, I would urge
the construction of a railway on the three and a half feet gauge from
Cunamulla to Hergott (Marree) Springs. The country is level: the cost
little. This done, Australia is connected from Ocean to Ocean (Brisbane
to Augusta) by uniform rail. The earnings of the line would be enor-
mous. I lived in the interior and collected information first-hand. Tak-
ing the returns for wool, from sheep stations between Bourke and the
Gulf, I estimated the income to exceed the value of the total output of
mineral for Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie by £3,000,000.
To establish Australian Rule on the northern coast and New Guinea, so
as to make our influence permanent and those places an enduring asset,
is the problem we must solve. Will we ever people those places? Name
one instance where the British have successfully colonized a dominion
in the tropics, and I will surrender my doubts. God having fixed the
bounds of man’s habitation (Acts 17: 26), has confirmed it by physical
laws and circumstances that we cannot defeat.
Think of British capital vainly wasted endeavouring to colonize Central
America. In this work I am taking no risks —I am submitting only
historical facts. The European can live and labour in any climate but
his female can not. Why in the bloom of life can not a European woman
remain in the Northern Territory or New Guinea? Because nature does
not intend her to produce there —she must get away or die. Without
her there can be no colonization. To cross the European male with the
native female is not practical. The inherent instinct with all the tribes
of the world is against the half-caste. The solution of the problem is
at hand. Scholars agree Indian and English are the same race—both of
the Aryan group. Why waste life and time trying to acclimatize the
European when there are people nearer of the same race already acclima-
tized, and already part of the British Empire? Co-operate with the
Indian Government. Our future in the Pacific depends upon your
action. In case of necessity the Indian Army are our nearest ally.
Wisely select the location in Northern Territory and New Guinea for a
village agricultural settlement, establish it with a hundred young couples
from the schools and orphanages of India—people who are cultured with
our culture, trained with our refinement, and educated to our standard
of living—and the enterprize will repay an hundred fold


Mr. Nawab Bilgrami, the Director of Public Instruction in India, after
having paid a visit to St. Andrew’s schools, said:—-
What has been the result of all this painstaking effort on the
part of the British in India for the past 100 years? It is difficult
to write at length, for I know' the risk of hurting susceptibilities.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that neither British nor Indian can live
in perpetual isolation and thrive. The combined interest and united
prayer of both people alike is—that we all may be one.' -
No one is more competent to expound the White Australian policy than
I am. I lived wdien the phrase was coined, and was acquainted with those
who popularized it, and by whose influence it was placed on the Statute
Book. “White Australia” means: exclude the undesirable. The war
extended its application to Central Europe, and the Italian was always
a sorry proposition. The British emigrants are to us the choicest and
best. They can, however, but people the southern States. This leaves
our tropical possessions unprovided for where a large body of loyal
subjects are most urgently required, and where alone the policy of
emigration is seriously needed. Now, consider the fitness of the St.
Andrew’s Homes and Schools to supply this need.
I have 100 letters from ex-pupils now in various parts of the world.
To prepare a digest of them wmuld occupy more space than I can afford,
hut the following will furnish an idea: —
C. Savigny, Engine Driver.
B. Bayley, Supervisor of Telegraphs.
P. Mooseck, Wireless Operator in Persia for oil. Co. says where he is
shade heat 115; likes place well.
R. Hardy, five years in Telegraph Department.
G. McGregor, won cup 800 yards foot-race; now member of Institute
of Engineers.
Ted Hossack, Bhojudik, Railway Sub-Inspector.
Bob Smith, 2J years railway guard.
K. Adolphus, U.S.A., Mechanical Draughtsman with Illinois Central
Railroad.
Jean Pirrit went to Scotland. At Glasgow' took the M.A. Degree.
Margaret Towers, Nellie Dutton, Jean McGregor, all obtained Indian
Government Medical Certificate. They seem mostly to prefer farming,
hut have found New Zealand and Canada rather too cold. Seeing our
tropical possessions are peopled by the uneducated, it is only educated
people that should be sent to them. By so doing, colonization would be
advanced by 100 years, for it has taken that time to bring St. Andrew’s
Homes up to what they are to-day. The only portion of the world
from which I have no letters from the ex-pupils of these Schools is the
great Continent on which the Rev. James Clow sleeps. “It may he dif-
ferent one of those days.” In this case the chance is not wanting to
make it so. It only requires the Australian Nelson to give it effect.
Nestled between the beautiful hills that surround it, Canberra must
rapidly become a lovely garden city. It has a picturesque setting that is
strangely unique yet characteristic of Australia. It inspires us with love
for our country, and fills our hearts with admiration for its statesmen,
and leads us to think, if they have done this much well, how much will
they yet arrange to a glorified order? On the 9th May, 1927, I attended
the ceremony in connection with the opening of the Federal Parliament
House. I saw the Duke of York when he arrived; he was dressed as an
Admiral. Still his mild features made him appear to me like a young
Evangelist, and the ceremony throughout was truly of an evangelical
order. As I walked about in that great gathering throughout the day, I
looked well into the faces of the people to see if there were present any
I knew from remote places of the Continent, but I saw none I knew, and
I felt for the companionship of my own loved ones who had crossed the
Divide. Great gatherings impress us with the thought that we can
place no arrest on time —the generations just come and go, and all we
can do is to he ready for the call when it comes; and so I spoke with
Mr. Henry Nash.


On Friday, 15th June, 1928, from the roof of Parliament House, I saw
the “Southern Cross” appearing from the clouds after having achieved
the wonderful flight from America across the Pacific Ocean, piloted by
Kingsford Smith and Ulm. After the aviators had landed their great air-
craft, and were advancing towards the Parliamentary buildings, a few
people assembled on the approach. I did not know them, nor do I think
they knew each other. Among the company was a lady who seemed a
little forward. As the aviators ascended the steps the lady advanced and
shook hands with them. She said:
“May I kiss you?”
“Certainly,” said Mr. Smith, “why not!”
