In Memoriam
THE LATE CAPTAIN LESLIE HENLEY
t
Oh, brave and gentle heart,
■ Well hast thou played thy-'part
Afar in France!
The call of duty came
And set thy soul aflame. :
- No backward glance*
Although the promise line
Of youth and hope was thine.
No senseless lust for cruel strife sent thee
To die ten thousand miles across, the sea,
A nobler creed
Inspired thy deed.
And now, with other splendid dead, at rest
Thou liest, folded close to France's breast.
Well hast thou fought in Freedom’s fight,
O Soldier Youth—and so—Good Night

My Dear Sir,
Herewith I am sending you the
short Preface which you desire, find-
ing myself in full agreement with your
little book, which I think ought to
appeal to everyone who recognises the
nature of this War and at the same
time the mission of Christianity to
contribute all that it can to the estab-
lishment of a permanent peace, in the
way of influencing the minds of people
and statesmen.
Your book puts the case very simply
and clearly and I wish it success.

PREFACE
BY
THE RIGHT HON. VISCOUNT BRYCE, O.M.
THIS little book lays down with
clearness three propositions
whose truth and force ought to be
apparent to all thoughtful observers,
and especially to all who hold the
principles of Christianity and believe
that in the teachings of Christ lies the
best guidance for mankind.
The first of these propositions is
that war has been and is a terrible
scourge to mankind. There are times
when, as most of us think, we must
resort to it in the defence of right and
justice. That is what we believe our-
selves to be now doing. But it ought


to be a prime object with all Chris-
tians to reduce as far as possible the
chance of the outbreak of war, with
all the sorrows and sufferings it draws
in its train.
The second proposition is that the
sufferings endured and the horror felt
at the cruelties perpetrated in this
most frightful war, cruelties unknown
for some centuries past, ought to lead
the nations that love peace to make
a supreme effort, as soon as this war
has come to an end by the victory of
the Allies, to prevent the recurrence
of any similar calamities in the future.
And thirdly, the author of this book
seeks to show that it is in a special
manner a duty, and indeed a para-
mount duty, of the Christian Church
to exert itself for the purpose just
A 2


mentioned. Peace and goodwill
among men, whether they be indi-
viduals or peoples, ought to be
preached by every Christian minister,
and devotion, peace and goodwill ought
to be taught by the example of every
Christian, be he clergyman or layman.
The author points out that this is
an opportunity, such as was never
presented to Christian nations before,
of making a final decision between
two courses. The one course is that
the nations should acquiesce in war as
a necessity and should continue to
burden themselves with the provision
of gigantic armaments wherewith to
defend themselves against one another,
each living always in an alarm of
attack from some aggressive Power.
The other course is to try to form,


after this war is over, a combination
among peace-loving peoples, each of
which will pledge itself to settle
controversies by means of arbitration
or conciliation instead of by war,
and will undertake to assist any
other nation within the combination
which is attacked by a State that
has refused to arbitrate a controversy.
This is the kind of policy which
the author of this book desires to
press upon the Churches as deserving
their advocacy. It is a plan which is
already much discussed among us and
has been taken up very warmly by
some of the most eminent statesmen
of America. We in Britain are glad
to know that it is commending itself
to statesmen in Australia also. Much
thought will be needed to settle the


form it ought to take; but the prin-
ciple is sound.
The simple and straightforward
earnestness of this book ought to
commend it to all who desire the wel-
fare and happiness of mankind, and
who believe with its author that
progress along the lines which he sug-
gests will be best secured by following,
and endeavouring to put in practice,
the precepts of the Gospel.

AN APPRECIATION
BY
REV. J. D. JONES, M.A., D.D.
I have read this little book with great interest
and with complete sympathy. By writing it
and publishing it Mr. Henley has put all
Christian people in his debt. The main
appeal of the book is an appeal to the Christian
Church to set about the task of educating men’s
consciences so that this appalling war shall be
the last war of all. Mr. His a public man
and a politician, but he believes that the real,
compelling and decisive word in this matter
must he spoken by the
find myself in complete agreement with him.
By its very Gospel the Christian Church is
committed to the cause of world-wide peace.
War is essentially anti-Christian. It has no
place in a completely Christian scheme of
things. The Lord of the Church hears as one


of His glorious names the title “ Prince of
Peace.” “ Peace and goodwill to men ”
the song sung at His advent. To break down
middle walls of 'partition, to reconcile antagon-
isms, to make Jew and Gentile, Englishman
and German one, was the object of His living
and dying. The Church must make it its
business to turn this “ ”
Gospel speaks into a blessed fact of human life.
The precise method of securing this world
peace must perhaps be left to the statesmen,
but the impulse which is secure must
and can only come from
The present hour presents a peculiar oppor-
tunity to the Christian There is a
“ tide in the aff airs of men ” just now, which
if the Church takes it at the flood, may bring
us into the blessed enjoyment of international
peace. This war represents the utter break-
down of a merely materia civilization.
There is no power in culture or commerce or


common sense that can tame and hind the evil
passions of men . The calamitous failure of
these things is disposing men to turn to Christ
and the Christian faith as the world's only
hope . They are realizing that man himself
must he remade, that human nature must he
re-created before the happy day of peace can
come, and to the task of making man a “ new
creature ” the mighty spiritual energies resi-
dent in the Gospel alone are equal . When
Rome fell fourteen centuries ago, the very
fabric of ancient civilization seemed to have
been destroyed . But in that dark hour Augus-
tine held up before the eyes of the Church the
ideal of a u City of God 99 fairer far than Rome
ever was, and, inspired by that vision, the
Church took hold of that broken civilization
and built it up again into a finer fabric than
that which had been destroyed . Another
civilization is being broken and shattered
before our eyes . But it is in the Church's


power to rebuild it into some likeness to that
Holy City which the Seer in a moment of
high vision was privileged to behold, a city
free from mourning, free from tears, free from
pain, free from death and blessed with the
peace of God. It is to that great task Mr.
Henley summons us. May the Church as a
whole have grace to respond to his appeal!
The Manse.

AFTER THE WAR
OUR faith and hope, supported
by our willingness to sacrifice,
make us feel that we with our Allies
are destined to win out of this awful
war and secure a signal victory over
our present day enemies. The ques-
tions which, as a consequence, suggest
themselves to thoughtful minds that
know something of the past history
of nations, that understand in some
degree the psychology of peoples and
can peer just a little into the future,
are these :
How long after peace is signed will
the nations of the earth be at rest ?


How long will they abstain from
murdering each other for illusory
ends ?
Is there not a better, more humane
and less wasteful way of settling in-
ternational disputes ?
In reply to these all - important
questions, I propose to jot down a
few mental impressions, hoping that
they will meet the eyes of those who
are able to lead the way and accom-
plish “ the regeneration
First, then, it is not hard for us to
remember that for many years some
of our great men saw the coming of
the present Armageddon and tried
to avoid it by proposing a limitation
of armaments. But Germany, ob-
sessed and arrogant, caring little for
the lives of her people, and nothing


for the lives and rights of others, feel-
ing herself “ superman ” bent upon
subduing and enslaving the world,
would not agree. And there
was no union of Intern
compel her to agree, moral suasion not
only failed, but actually accelerated
the race for death-dealing devices.
THE CHURCH'S WORK
When Germany and her vicious allies
are driven back on to their own terri-
tories and the Hohenzollem dynasty
is wiped off the world’s escutcheon
we shall be facing the dawn of a
new world with glorious possibilities
for mankind. By winning the war,
the Allies, united in the blood of
sacrifice, will be able to declare that
“ might shall no longer be right,”


but that “right shall be made the
guiding and dominating force ” of the
world.
To do this and to establish right-
eousness as the governing principle
by which our inevitable disputes
shall be settled, we have to create
an International power to “ enforce
convention regulations, and arbitra-
tion judgments,” and so police the
world.
It required the heat of a world-war
to fuse the nations and make such a
union of strength possible for the heal-
ing of the nations. It is only now
that we are able to recognise the
moving life in that long-time dormant
germ of the white flower of ever-
lasting international peace which
has been fructified the blood


supreme sacrifice willingly given by the
nations' 1 bravest and best.
The point I wish to urge is that this
is essentially a matter for the Chris-
tian Church.
Will the united Christian Church
of the Allies fail to see the golden
opportunity for service and “ pass by
on the other side ” ?
Shall it be said that we failed in our
duty to our dead heroes, “ that the
magical words: ‘ Carry On ’ did not
appeal to us,” that “ we allowed the
great and only time” for real inter-
national Christian lasting
peace to pass ?
Many will make excuse and ask,
“ Why Just now ? ” and, “ Why is
it pointed out as the Church’s special
work ? ” I answer, “ Because this is
B


the one psychological period in the
world’s history when such a glorious
end to international wars will be pos-
sible” Never before could it have
been accomplished and never again
may the flood-tide of opportunity
come to us. Until now the allied
nations have been apart, cold, and
somewhat callous, except for their
own safety and aggrandisement. Now,
we are able to obtain a new perspec-
tive of each other and understand
and appreciate one another better.
THE CHOICE OF TWO ROADS
It is just now, when the seven times
heated furnace of national affliction is
fiercely burning, and the molten metal
of a united sacrifice and sympathy is


running freely, that we can cast a
band that shall he str
the nations to a lasting
I am positively persuaded that
the foundations of the Temple of In-
ternational Justice must be laid now,
cemented by the bloo
whose memorial such an accomplish-
ment would perpetuate.
We all agree that through the fires
and tempest of the present holocaust
we have passed a crisis which renders
it impossible to return to former con-
ditions. Life can never again be
the same to us. We British have to
rebuild and reconstruct our ideas of
the world at large. “
isolation ” has lost a
to have. New and terrible inventions
remind us we can no longer safely


occupy the rich plains and fenced-in
pastures of our own great Empire
regardless of the rights and con-
ditions of others. Old ideas and
traditions have been obliterated, the
barriers between class and class are
battered and broken down. In a sen-
tence, with civilisation in our hands,
we have passed the mount
have arrived with our
pinnacle of the world’s
tunity for mankind, and it is just here
that the enormous responsibilities of
Christianity rest upon the leaders of
the united Churches of the Allies.
From this altitude two roads only
open out before us :
One leading towards the noon-
day of accomplishment where
equity and justice, safety, civilisa


tion and the extension of God’s
Kingdom of peace on earth may be
found.
The other a devious and tortu-
ous track beset by secret foes, where
blind trust and false hopes predom-
inate, and where the nations drift
on the highway of selfishness,
greed, barbarism, and infidelity,
with the certainty of being involved
in recurring civil and international
wars too awful to contemplate.
Which shall it be ?
We believe that we are fighting and
sacrificing for civilisation and justice.
But if, in the winning of

A COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE
Mankind, being a free-willed crea-
tion, endowed with the power of
choice between good or evil, must
choose the path the nations are to
walk, and it is here that
Churches can exert a
upon the minds of men and
acts of the nations in
enduring peace.
If the impelling force of conscience
controls and directs our individual
acts, how important it is that the
collective conscience of the nations
should be heard on so important a
subject.
There was a time when the Non-
conformist Conscience of England


moved with great power and accom-
plished much good in correcting
national errors of omission and com-
mission. The need of our time is a
collective conscience, the

ing peace of the world.

the realisation of that
To my mind, there is not the least
doubt as to whose duty it is to lead
the way, whose duty it is to arouse
and focus for action—the expression
of the national conscience of the
nations, dictating, if needs be, the


outstanding conditions upon which
the world’s peace shall be built.
This God-given work must
upon and is primarily
the duty of the leaders of
Church, individually or collectively
working as may seem best, and re-
membering that it will not only be
a sin against the nations to neglect so
plain a duty, but a negation of Chris-
tianity. What is the use of praying
“ Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be
done on earth as it is in Heaven ” if,
when so rare an opportunity arises, we
fail to work in the direction that must
bring “ Peace on earth, good will to
men ” ?
To establish “ the brotherhood of
man ” and “ the federation of the
world ” in the creation of and main


tenance of the world’s peace, is more
than an ideal now—it is a possible
accomplishment, worthy of the
Church’s best effort.
PEACE, OR THE DREADFUL
ALTERNATIVE
To neglect to read the signs of the
times and blindly to disregard a plain
duty would be more than a blunder.
It would be a sin.
There can be no escape in this
matter.
If the united Church is to remain a
living factor for good, must be the
medium through which the national
conscience may be felt in the Councils
of the Empires on the
If it will, the Church can come into


its own by carrying out this its true
mission on earth.
Is the life of the world to be one of
progress, spiritually and socially, for
the great mass of mankind, or is it to
be a miserable failure, burdened too
with the ever-increasing nerve-rack-
ing consciousness of fear against in-
ternational and civil wars, and with
an inevitable drift towards infidelity ?
Many will shrink from taking this
view.
After this war, they will argue that
the nations will be too prostrated to
fight again for another fifty years.
I am quite willing to concede that or
any other period, but that is Just
where the Dreadful Alternative to an
international peace agreement comes
in.


Imagine, if you can :
Each of the great nations con-
tinuing as before the war, arming
to the highest pitch of efficiency
within their powers of taxation.
Continually scrapping the old for
the new.
Adding incessantly to the terrors
of warfare novel and secret inven-
tions for aerial, undersea, and land
defensive and offensive operations
and munitions for the killing of
human beings and the destroying
of property.
We cannot blind ourselves to what
the end would be —misunderstand-
ings and international disputes are
bound to arise (as they do in our civil
life), and finally, nothing could hold


back the world from wars too awful
to contemplate. It is quite impossible
even now to isolate a war between two
nations.
THE MENACE OF CIVIL WAR
But, says “ Militarism,” the best
way to prevent war is to be fully pre-
pared for war. Our experience clearly
dissipates such an hypothesis. Very
often the power to take
desire and impels Germany
was the most prepared nation at the
beginning of the present war. She
could have had no fear for her Com-
merce or for invasion of her Territory,
yet Germany deliberately, with malice
aforethought, started the present
awful carnage —and what will she
gain for all her preparedness ?


But suppose, if you will, that the
terrors of another Armageddon would
be sufficient to hold all the nations to
an armed peace.
What then ? Are we sure of peace
at home ?
Would not the burdensome cost of
such a preparedness not only drain
the rich and discourage the thrifty, hut
in an unbearable degree become the poor
man’s burden ?
The enormous wealth waste (which
after this war will be preventible if
the nations are wise), accompanied
by the inevitable grinding poverty
of the masses, would in turn lead to
civil war that would be not less
serious for us than an International
conflagration. Just as a little know-
ledge may be dangerous, so may a


little civilisation. Rulers and leaders
of men in high places stand on ex-
tremely slippery ground in this re-
gard. No one can deny that our
twentieth-century civilisation presents
to us irresistible demands—such e.g.
as these :
That the whole human family
shall be better fed, more comfort-
ably clothed and housed,
And that the terrors of a pau-
perised old age shall be abolished.
No man with a clear vision can fail
to see the moving mass of social dis-
content in the industrial underworld.
The conditions of
tedly have improved, but not so much
as the inventions and ingenuity of
man freed from war menace, and


properly applied, could have im-
proved them.
Now, with the winning of the war,
more is possible.
If the leaders of the allied nations
act humanely and wisely,
And if an International power is
set up to ensure us against a recur-
rence of so much wasted energy
and wealth,
We can have a complete emanci-
pation from the ever present fear
of starvation on the morrow, or
pauperism when life’s work is done.
What was financially impossible
before the war will be reasonably
possible after.
If we have the sense to establish
a new order of International secu-
rity, Industry and Invention can


be made to supply the wants of
mankind.
The proper housing, educating,
feeding, and clothing of the great
underworld of mankind, and the turn-
ing of their faces towards the light of
God’s glorious equality of oppor-
tunity, is a work worthy of the Church's
greatest effort and sacrifice.
Normal man is not necessarily a
born brute. Vicious evils are ac-
quired from conditions of living and
environment.
Now, if we care to “ it,” the
whole human family can be im-
measurably benefited and lifted clean
out of the slough of despond on to a
higher plane of living. But all this
is dependent upon our so arranging
peace that we shall be enabled to


divert the hulk of the expenditure of
treasure and time to upbuilding
the nation, instead bending
nation’s activities
facture of costly and death-
dealing devices.
“CARRY ON” CIVILISATION
Just here, might we not reasonably
ask ourselves
Does England, France, Russia,
or any other of the great Powers
want from one another that which
they are not entitled to have ?
If not, there need be no fear of
going to arbitration in the first,
second, or third degree.
Tribes, or even self-governing
0


states, are no longer allowed to resort
to arms. The walls around our cities
have lost their value, except to re-
mind us of less civilised times. The
grievances of separate entities do not
go unredressed, but the knowledge
that differences must be settled by a
public tribunal acts not only as a
deterrent but makes justice real and
effective. So must it be with the
nations. The principles
solidified the British
with safety be extended to the outer
world.
Treaties of peace without an Inter-
national Temple of Justice to give
judgments supported by a union of
power to enforce them, would be too
slender a tie to live by. Even in this
matter we are not without experience


to help us. The weakness of the Hague
is the absence of pto enforce its
decisions. This can all be made good
now if we are only sane enough to
“ Carry on ” the
humanity and Chri Might
is no longer a legal right within
the Empire, why should it be with-
out ? To accomplish this reform we
must have the compel
awakened conscience
mination that the law and
dictates of humanity
dard to guide the nati —and where
is the channel of communication more
plainly to be seen than in the Church ?
If it fails to express the peoples’ will
on so divine a mission, it fails its day
and generation.


THE FUTILITY OF WAR
There is, I am reminded, world-
wide objection to the limitation of
armaments. I have even heard it
seriously stated that wars are a neces-
sary corrective of over-population,
and furthermore that it is not within
the power of man to end appeals to
arms in the settlement of International
disputes. If such a thesis were per-
missible, or any considerable number
of sane men and women believed it,
it would only go to show that we had
lost faith in God, or that there is no
God. It would, mo
civilisation is a wicked lie, and that in
the end the human race would exter-
minate itself by its own evil inven-
tions.


Admit such an hypothesis, and
where do we find ourselves ?
Right up against the theory of
human progress.
Stagnation and darkness would
be about us, overshadowing our
every act, taking control of our
lives.
Human beings would degenerate
and become lower than the beasts
of the field, the breeds of which we
do so much to improve.
It was never intended
the youngest, the bra the
must be killed off to room
ensure life to the rema The doc-
trine of the survival of the fittest is
inestimably better for the human
race.
Every year, moreover, sees us put


ting a higher premium on child life.
Children are now regarded as a
national asset, but surely not for the
purpose of killing them off when they
grow up.
Again, is it not a fact that year by
year we reduce the catalogue of crimes
that must be expiated by death even
among criminals ?
The fact is, we have evolved, are
growing up out of t
barism, we stand m
towards the light of
Those of us who believe in the evolu-
tion and regeneration of mankind
believe that a new era is at hand
if only we have the confidence and
courage to walk through the opened
door and inherit that which will be
possible after the winning of the war.


LASTING PEACE AN IMPERATIVE
NECESSITY
First, we must make up our minds
that this is to be the last great Inter-
national war. Sir William Robertson
(Chief of the Staff) has declared that
we must “ suffer
the field, or in the coun
imposed upon the All
merely to win the war,
and such a peace as
required by the great
been made.”
We must not only endorse that
great truth, but insist that a peace
to be commensurate with our sacri-
fices must be lasting.
it must be assured
the allied powers o
tively controlled.


PROFESSIONAL MILITARISM
But the greatest Goliath in the road
to the temple of lasting peace to be
safeguarded and guaranteed by the
union of international power will be
found (it is to be feared) in the master-
ful, domineering autocracy of that
section of the naval and military
caste which fattens on the game of
war.
Not all highly placed soldiers, lam
thankful to say, but some of those I
have met, cheerfully preach war at
the base, but take great care to en-
gineer themselves into safe olliccs as
indispensables, clear of the danger
line when the guns are booming in
earnest, I know one such who, fight-
ing most heroically with his tongue in


a well-furnished office with a batman
to fold his clothes and a chauffeur
with plenty of petrol to coca his
official and, sometimes, officious brow,
expressed the hope that Turkey will
not be finally beaten in this war and
come to an end as a fighting force,
because, he explains, Turkey in
Europe is such a useful and fruitful
source of wars, excusing armed inter-
vention, and thereby upholding the
military profession. Never let us lose
sight of this fact: “ Militarism is Mili-
tarism the world over.” We rightly
blame Prussian Militarism for the
present holocaust. But give English,
French, Russian, Italian, or any other
Militarism the same encouragement
and power, and in a very few decades
the civilian population of those nations


will count for little more than tax-
paying slaves and pawns in the game
of war.
If prevention is better than cure,
we must take note and profit by
the experience of to-day. Germany,
which was well on the high-road to
Commercial supremacy, gave its soul
to militarism, and so lost its place in
the world’s commerce, and has be-
come the outcast race among the
nations of the earth.
It is for the Allied Nations to take
heed lest, following and worshipping
the same fetish, a greater evil befall
them in the years to come.
We rightly proclaim to the world
that we are fighting and sacrificing
for civilisation and justice to the
smaller nations, but unless we take


out of the fiery cauldron of Inter-
national strife the cure for Inter-
national murder, we shall have won
the war, but not peace.
The iniquity of Militarism must be
stamped out once and for all. And
with Militarism must be throttled the
monster of International greed and
thirst for power, a heritage of ancient
barbarism still active, and still potent,
checkmating all the civilising power
of Christianity.
And now, through great sorrow
and sacrifice, it is possible for us to
inaugurate a world power to control
this world evil.


THE CHURCH'S HOUR
It may be asked why are the
leaders of Christianity challenged
to so great a service ?
Is it not wholly a political and
diplomatic debt due to civilisation
and the comity of nations ?
My answer is that Governments
have their hands and heads fully oc-
cupied with the enormous responsi-
bilities in the conduct of the war, and
in the task of ensuring the first essen-
tial to a lasting International peace,
namely, a complete victory, while
diplomats are fully occupied in oiling
the Entente machinery and in coun-
teracting the inventions of the enemy.
The political and diplomatic turn
at the peace wheel will come when the


collective conscience of the Allied
Powers decrees that such a form of
peace must be established when the
din of war ceases. Our leaders, more-
over, must be confirmed in what they
do by the People’s will —which is the
people’s mind and conscience.
the duty of the Ch
the will of the people, to strengthen
and energise it towards the only
thinkable outcome of the great war.
This is the Church’s opportunity —to
preach the old gospel of peace on
earth —to preach it as the consum-
mation of the new age and the new
world.
While our plighted word requires
that Germany s
broken temples and
of the civilisation our


Christianity requires of us that we
rouse ourselves to rebuild mankind
on a sure foundation that will secure
to our children and our children’s
children a firm and stable freedom
and a lasting peace.
