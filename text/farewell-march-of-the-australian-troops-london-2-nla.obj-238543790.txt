The Australians Farewell March
THE public of London which will look on at the
Australians’ farewell march through the city
to-day has always had a warm corner in its
heart for the Dominion troops, and the Aus-
tralians want no recommendation to them, least of
all on Anzac Day. Their march to-day, the anni-
versary of the day which bruited their fame all over
the world, is in the nature of a farewell by the men
of the Australian Imperial Force to the people of the
Old Country.
Not many of the men who will be seen on to-day’s
march took part in the landing on Gallipoli on the
first Anzac Day. The gallant remnant which has
survived to the end of the war is not a large body, and
most of those have gone home to Australia. This
farewell march commemorates them, and represents
the splendid volunteer citizen army (five divisions
in France and most of two in grew out
of that first Australian Expeditionary Force.


Anzac Day has become a national day for the people
of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Dominion
of New Zealand ; and, till memory dies of the struggles
and sacrifices of the great war just ended, Anzac Day
will continue to be celebrated by the British Dominions
under the Southern Cross, and by the men of those
Dominions wherever a collection of them may happen
to be. The march to-day is a salute to their comrades
who made this day famous, and is meant too to convey
some grateful tribute to the British people for a kindly
reception and a generous hospitality which have never
failed during the four years of a temporary home here.
This country is Blighty to the Australians, as it
is to all ranks of the British Army. Here they have
spent their leave from France ; here their wounded
were brought to hospitals; and throughout the
length and breadth of these islands are houses, great
and small, where families have voluntarily thrown
open their doors to welcome Australian soldiers as
guests. No Australian can return to his own country
without a lasting memory of those kindly people, of
the happy times spent with them, and of London, which
has adopted them almost as her own.
The Australian Imperial Force is homeward bound
—this Is Anzac Day, and—Good-bye. C.
