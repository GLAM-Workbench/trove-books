(jiuieu w c Will Be.
Words by WILLIAM CARRINGTON.
Solo—
We’ve a land that claims no blood-stained
roll of war on land and sea,
But its name shines fair on History’s scroll
as the Home of the Frank and Free !
Its sons have proved, through fire and flood.
Brave, Steadfast, True;
Right worthy they of their British blood
and the Land of the Kangaroo.
Chorus—-’
’Tisthe Land we love ! the Grand New Land !
the Home of the Frank and Free !
Then Hurrah ! Hurrah ! for Australia, united
soon to be !
For Peace, not Strife, the Call goes forth,
from East to West, from South to North,
United we will be!
We’ve a land that laughs in sunshine strong,
and ripples with harvest corn
That has never felt a tyrant’s thong, nor
suffered a despot’s scorn !
Music by S. McBURNEY, Mus. Doc
We hold our own ! we rule our own I shoul
der to shoulder stand
For Right and Might, by Britain’s Throne,,
and the Dear Old Motherland I
We’ve a land that gleams with treasures
vast of gold and silver store;
But we proudly deem our wealth is cast in
our sons and daughters more.
But though our Austral Land is one, and
one our tongue and lore,
We’re barred apart, though one in heart,
by the curse of the Customs’ door.
Say ! shall Australians stand apart beneath
the Austral Cross,
And let dividing rancors start the feuds of
Strife and Loss!
It cannot be ! it shall not be! divided we
must fall!
United shall Australia be, For Strength,
and Peace, and all!
Music may be obtained from A. & W. BRUCB, Printers, 434 Bourke Street, for One Shilling.


Unity is Strength.
Words by WILLIAM CARRINGTON. Tune—“ March of the Men of Harlech
Mr. D. R. Davies, the Conductor of the Exhibition Choir, and the Collins
Street Choral Society, requested the writer to supply him with Federation verses,
written so that they might be sung at Federation Meetings, to the well-known
and popular tune of “ The March of the Men of Harlech.’’ The writer has
accordingly furnished Mr. Davies with the following verses:—
Come! Australians ! once for ever
Break the bars that now dissever
Brothers—to be parted never,
Unity is Strength !
Be no longer disunited,
By no phantoms be affrighted,
Let Australia’s wrongs be righted,
Unity is Strength!
All divisions ended !
Each by all defended !
One our land
And future grand,
And one the flag that’s o’er us !
One in race and one in story
One in power and one in glory,
One in all that makes a nation !
Unity is Strength!
See ! Victorians ! all are waiting,
Now, with fervour unabating,
Let there be no hesitating,
Unity is Strength!
South Australia nobly leading,
New South Wales the call, too, heeding,
Wave provincial far receding,
Unity is Strength!
Answers back Tasmania:
“ Vote ‘ Yes ’ ! for Australia ! ”
Queensland, too,
Relies on you,
And West Australia’s calling !
Union offers —will ye flout it ?
Now your answer—who dare doubt it ?
To the wide world we will shout it,
Unity is Strength !
Austral’s sons and daughters, o’er us
From the Grand Old Land that bore us
Peals the Patriotic Chorus !
Unity is Strength!
See the Scotch, the Welsh, the English,
Old-time feuds and strife extinguish ;
Ireland’s sons, too, now distinguish
Unity is Strength!
Scorn, then, ways provincial,
Rise to life Imperial;
Land of Light,
And Progress bright!
No more shall Strife degrade her !
Strong for War, should foes invade her,
Great in Peace, should Peace still aid her,
Thus we pledge our loved Australia !
Unity is Strength !


Australians True.
Words by J. HUME COOK, M.L.A.
Solo —
Up, brothers, up, and sing,
Shout, shout with glee !
Down with divisions wrong,
One blood are we!
Ring out the chorus wild,
Join hand in hand ;
Up for the Commonwealth,
Long may it stand.
Strive for the union strong.
Strike for it now ;
Beat back the traitors all,
That be your vow.
Up for Australia,
Land of the free,
Strike now in Glory's name,
One race are we !
Chorus —
Fight for Australia,
Fight to be free,
Strike home for Unity,
One blood are we !
Music by HENRY WALTON
Ring out the chorus wild,
Join hand in hand,
Up for the Commonwealth,
Long may it stand.
Come, then, Australians all,
Join in the fray,
March on to victory,
God speed the day !
Quit ye like men and leal,
Loyal and true,
Stand for the Nation’s cause,
Gain all her due.
Up, then, and onward go,
Staunch in your right;
Dare all at Duty’s call,
Honor is might!
Up for Australia,
Land of the free,
Strike now in Glory’s name.
One race are we !
Music (2 /-) may be obtained at ALLAN & CO., Collins Street.


Advance Australia.
Words by J. EGGLESTON WALKER.
Rise, Australians ! mark your day !
Seize the standard, bear the sway ;
Drive the clouds of sloth away,
And Advance ! still Advance !
Know your fathers left their home,
Far beyond the ocean’s foam ;
Know they trod your native strand,
Led the way, and left command
To Advance ! still Advance !
Advance Australia! still, still Advance!
Seize the best of nations’ best,
Land of labour, wealth and rest :
Where unaided, unoppressed.
We Advance! still Advance !
Southern land of sunny sky,
Land where freedom ne’er can die—
Where both Art and Science pour
Gifts from an exhaustless store—
Now Advance ! still Advance !
Advance Australia ! still, still Advance!
Music by S. McBURNEY, Mus. Doc.
Should some foe disturb our land,
Beat each heart and clasp each hand ;
Hark ! that rising, that command—
Now Advance ! still Advance !
Wives and sisters, mothers dear,
Never waver, never fear !
Ever faithful, ever just,
Who’ll deny their sacred trust
To Advance ? still Advance!
Advance Australia ! still, still Advance I
Pass the watchword right along,
Federation be our song!
Parted weak, united strong
To Advance ! still Advance I
By each faithful soul’s appeal,
By the patriot’s fiery zeal.
By that God who aids the right—
On the waves of Freedom's might
We advance ! still Advance !
Advance Australia! still, still Advance j


Australia’s Cherished Dream.
Words by
MARION MILLER.
They are gathering for the Roll-call from
the East unto the West!
Now, rise up, every slumbering one, and
follow with the rest!
I hear the bugles sounding, and the trumpet’s
steady blare,
And a Nation’s mighty shouting with its
thunder rends the air !
They are mustering fast and faster ! From
the hill-tops to the sea
They chant the glorious tidings of a well-won
victory !
They gather not for bloodshed, though their
weapons brightly gleam,
But with joyful pride, to realise Australia’s
cherished dream !
Refrain—
They come, they come; their banners stream
on every wind that blows,
And Federation’s holy name in every fold
disclose.
Now, halt 1 O standard bearer ! and face the
risen sun—
The Nation’s first great festival, its joyance
hath begun.
Music by
JOSEPH GILLOTT, R.C.M., Leipzig.
They count their tens of thousands, with a
wild, exultant thrill !
Like their own forest trees they stand, defy-
ing every ill.
Like their own forest trees that cleave firm-
rooted to the sod,
Their hearts shall cling to native land, their
eyes look up to God !
Now may the mighty Lord of Hosts each
arm with courage nerve,
That manfully and loyally our country we
may serve!
That never party feeling may with discord
swell the tone
The Ruler of the Universe meant but for
love alone!
Refrain —
They come, they come ! their banners stream
on every wind that blows,
And Federation’s holy name in every fold
disclose.
Now, halt! O standard bearer ! and face the
risen sun—
Australia’s first great festival, its joyance
hath begun.

“An Australian National Song.”
Words by “ Anonymous."
Australia, Australia, thou land of sun and
sea,
We love thee, we thy free-born sons, as we
love liberty.
We link our hands from shore to shore, and
swear to stand by thee,
One land, one flag, one brotherhood, one
glorious destiny.
We link our hands from shore to shore, and
swear to stand by thee,
One land, one flag, one brotherhood, one
glorious destiny.
Australia, Australia, thou land of golden
fleece,
To thee our fathers boldly steered their
fearless Argosies.
Our fathers cast their lot for thee, by thee
they lived and died,
And left to us their handiwork, a heritance
of pride.
Our fathers cast their lot for thee, by thee
they lived and died,
And left to us their handiwork, a heritance
of pride.
Music by
GEORGE W. L. MARSHALL-HALL.
Australia, Australia, thou land of liberty.
Where each man is himself a king, each
home a monarchy.
Though here and there, as best they might,
our fathers founded thee,
We’ll hand thee down one land, by God, to
all posterity.
Though here and there, as best they might,
our fathers founded thee,
We’ll hand thee down one land, by God, to
all posterity.
Australia, Australia, thou child of sun and
sea,
We love thee, every father’s son that loveth
liberty.
We lift our hands to God on high, and swear
to stand by thee ;
One land, one flag, one brotherhood, one
glorious destiny I
We lift our hands to God on high, and swear
to stand by thee ;
One land, one flag, one brotherhood, one
glorious destiny.
