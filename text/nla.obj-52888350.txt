PREFATORY NOTE.
This Key is intended mainly to save the time and lighten the work
of Teachers; but it will also serve as a guide to private students
reading the subject with few or no opportunities of instruction.
Since the latter class of readers may feel some doubt as to the
form in which a geometrical solution should be presented, the
earlier Exercises are worked out in full; but later it has been
thought sufficient in most cases to indicate only the chief steps of
the proof.*
The Answers given in the Geometry to graphical questions were
derived from calculation, and are therefore correct as far as the
digits are carried. But since it is impossible either to draw or to
measure with absolute accuracy, results obtained graphically can
only be relied upon as rough approximations. Such results may be
considered satisfactory if they come within one per cent, of the
formal Answer.
Our thanks are due to Mr. H. C. Beaven of Clifton College, for
the material help he has given us both in solving Examples and
correcting sheets for the press.

3. Let AB, CD intersect at O, and suppose the z. ADD is a rt.z..
Then the adjacent L AOC is also a rt. L. [Th. I.]
Again, l‘ COB, BOD are respectively adjacent to L‘ AOC, AOD;
each is a rt. L. [ Th. I.]
4. The ext. angles are supplements of equal angles ;
they are equal. [Th. 1. Cor. 3.]
5. The ext. angles are supplements of equal angles ;
;. they are equal.
6. Let the st. line BO make with the st. line AOC the adjacent
z.‘ AOB, BOC.
Suppose OX and OY are the bisectors of these angles respec-
tively. ,
Because L BOX = half L BOA,
and l. BOY=half L BOC ;
.•. whole l XOY=half the sum of L‘ BOA, BOC
=half of two rt. U [Th. I.]
=a rt. L.
Again, by hypothesis, OY is the external bisector of the L BOA,
and OX is its internal bisector ;
the external and internal bisectors of the angle are at
rt. l' to one another.
K.S.G. A *


7. As in Ex. 6, the Z.XOY is a rt. L.
:. the L‘ BOX, BOY are complementary.
But l BOX = L AOX, and L BO Y =L CO Y ; [Fyp.]
the U AOX, COY are complementary.
8. The L’ COX, XOA are supplementary. [Th. I.]
But l XOA =L BOX ; [Hyp.]
the U COX, BOX are supplementary.
Again, U AOY, COY are supplementary. [Th. I.]
But l COY =l BOY ; [Byp.]
.'. the u AOY, BOY are supplementary.
9. z. AOB+z. BOC=2 rt. u [Th. I.]
= 180°;
and L AOB = 35°,
.-. L BOC = 180° - 35° = 145°;
L COY = half ,Z. BOC =72J°.

1. In one hour the minute-hand makes a complete revolution,
i.e. turns through 4 rt. L?, or 360°.
Hence, in 60 minutes the hand turns through 360°.
.•. in 1 minute the hand turns through 6°.
.'. the angles turned through in 5 minutes, 21 minutes,
43J minutes, and 14J minutes are respectively 6° x 5,
6° x 21, 6° x 43J and 6° x 141, 0 r 30°, 126°, 261°, and 85°.
Again, 6° is turned through in 1 minute.
.'. 66° is turned through in minutes, i.e. in 11 minutes ;
and 222° is turned through in s g s minutes, i.e. in 37 minutes.
2. In 12 hours the hour hand turns through 360°;
.'. in 1 hour it turns through 30°.
Hence (i) in 3J hrs. it turns through 30°x3J, or 112J° ;
(ii) in 5J hrs 30°x5J, or 155°.
And (iii) the time taken to turn through 172J° is hours,
i.e, 5J hrs.
the time is 5 hrs. 45 min.


3. The earth turns through 360° every 24 hrs., or 15° every hour;
.-. (i) in 3J hrs. the angle turned through is 15° x 3J, or 50°;
and (ii) 130° is turned through in hrs., i.e. 8 hrs. 40 min.
4. (i) The /.BOC = 180°-35°, or 145°, being the supplement of
the L AOC ; [Th. I.]
the l BOD = 35°, being equal to the /.AOC ; [Th. 3.]
the L DOA= 145°, being equal to the /. 800. [Th. 3.]
(ii) The /.COB = the /.AOD ; [Th. 3.]
each is half 250°, i.e. 125° ;
the /.COA, being the supplement of the /.COB,
= 180° -125°, or 55° ;
■ the/.BOD = the/.COA = 55°.
(iii) /.AOC+/.COB+/. BOD = 274°, [Hyph\
and /.AOC + /.COB =180°; [Th. I.]
.'. /.BOD = 274°-180° = 94°.
.'. the LAO D = the supplement of 180 D = 86°.
Now /_AOC = /.BOD = 94°, and L BOC=/.AOD = 86°.
5. The /.“ 800, COA are supplementary * * [Th. I.]
and L BOO=/..AOD by hypothesis ;
.'. U AOD, AOC are supplementary.
.'. CO, OD are in the same straight line. [Th. 2.]
6. Produce XO to Y.
Then L AOY = /. BOX, and /.COY=/. DOX. [Th. 3.]
But the U BOX, DOX are equal by hypothesis ;
.'. the U AOY, COY are equal;
/. OY bisects the L AOC.
7. The /.“’COX, DOX are supplementary. [Th. I.]
The l? DOX, COY are equal, being halves of the equal angles
BOD, AOC. [Th. 3.]
the L e COX, COY are supplementary.
/. OX and OY are in the same straight line. [Th. 2.]
8. After folding we have two equal angles AOX, BOX with a
common arm OX and on the same side of it.
.'. the remaining arms Ok, OB coincide.
If the /. AOX is greater than the /. BOX, OA falls outside the /.XOB,
less within ,s„


9. The angles BOC, BOD being both right angles are equal.
'Hence after folding we have two equal angles BOC, BOD,
with a common arm OB and lying on the same side of it;
and therefore their remaining arms, viz. OD, OC, coincide.
10. Unfold the paper and call the crease COD.
Then the U AOC, COB (which coincided when the paper was
folded) are equal to one another ;
and these being adjacent angles, each is a right angle ;
that is, CD is perpendicular to AB.
Page 19.
1. Let ABC be the isosceles A, in which AB=AC; and let AX
bisect the vert, l BAC, cutting BC at X.
Then in the A* BAX, CAX,
)BA = CA, by hypothesis,
and AX is common to both,
and L. BAX =L CAX, by hypothesis ;
.'. the triangles are equal in all respects'. [Th. 4.]
.‘. (i) BX=CX ; that is, AX bisects the base,
and (ii)
and these being adjacent angles, each is a right angle ;
that is, AX is perpendicular to the base.
2. Join PA, PB.
Then in the A’ POA, POB,
)OA=OB, by hypothesis,
and OP is common to both,
and L POA =l POB, being right angles ;
the triangles are equal in all respects ; [Th. 4.]
so that PA=PB.
3. In the A’ DAB, CBA,
)DA=CB, being sides of a square;
and AB is common ;
and L DAB =L CBA, being rt. L‘ ;
the A DAB = the A CBA in all respects ; [Tk. 4.]
.-. DB=CA.


4. (i) In the A'LBM, MCN,
)LB = MC, being halves of equal sides ;
and BM = CN, for the same reason ;
and L LBM =l MCN, being rt. L.’;
:. the A LBM = the A MCN in all respects ; [Th. 4.]
LM = MN.
(ii) In the A" ABM, DCM,
I AB = DC, being sides of a square ;
because -j and BM = CM, being halves of BC ;
(and L ABM =L DCM, being rt. U ;
the side AM=the side DM. [Th. 4.]
(iii) In the A'ABM, ADN,
(AB = AD, being sides of a square ;
and BM = DN, being halves of equal sides ;
and z.ABM=z.ADN, being rt. U ;
.-. AM = AN. [Th. 4.]
(iv) In the A' BCN, DCM,
{BC = DC, being sides of a square ;
and CN=CM, being halves of equal sides ;.
and the angle at C is common to both triangles ;
the A BCN = the A DCM in all respects ; [Th. 4.]
/. BN = DM.
5. In the A* BAY, CAX,
( BA = CA, being sides of an isos, triangle ;
and AY = AX, by hypothesis ;
and the angle at A is common to both triangles ;
/. BY = CX. [Th. 4.]
Page 21.
1. (i) Since AB=AD, [Hyp.]
:. the A ABD is isosceles ;
.'. Z.ABD = Z.ADB. [Th. 5.]
(ii) Similarly it may be shewn that
z.CBD=z.CDB.
(iii) Hence, adding the equal angles in (i) and (ii),
Z.ABC=Z. ADC.


2. In the A ABC, since AB = AC, by hypothesis,
Z. ABC = /_ACB. [Th. 5.]
And since DB = DC, \MvP-\
:. L DBC=z. DCB. [Th. 5.]
Hence the whole _ABD = the whole L ACD.
3. As in the last example it may be shewn that
Z. ABC=Z. ACB ;
and L DBC = Z. DCB.
the remaining z.ABD = the remaining ACD.
4. (i) In the A ! LBM, NCM,
)LB = NC, being halves of equal sides ;
and BM =CM, for a similar reason ;
also L LBM =l NCM ; [Th. 5.]
.-. LM = NM. [Th. 4.]
(ii) In the A s LBC, NCB,
)LB=NC, as above;
BC is common to both ;
and L LBC =L NCB; [Th. 5.]
/. LC = NB. [Th. 4.]
(iii) As in (i), the A" LBM, NCM are equal in all respects ;
.-. L BLM =Z. CNM.
their supplements, viz. z.'ALM, ANM are also equal.
Page 26.
1. Let Abe the vertex, and BC the base, of an isosceles A ABC ;
and let BC be bisected at D. Join AD.
Then in the A’ BDA, CDA,
f BD = CD, [Hyp.]
because -! and DA is common to both ;
[ and AB = AC; [Hyp.\
:. the triangles are equal in all respects. [Th. 7.]
So that (i) L BAD = L CAD ; that is, the L BAG is bisected :
and (ii) z.ADB = z.ADC.
And these being adjacent angles, each is a right angle ;
that is, AD is perp. to BC.


2. Let ABCD be a rhombus. Join AC.
Then in the A" DAC, BAG,
f AD = AB, being sides of a rhombus ;
because -J and CD = CB, for the same reason ;
[ and AC is common to both triangles ;
.'. the triangles are equal in all respects. [Th. 7.]
So that (i) z. ABC=A ADC;
and (ii) L BAC = A DAC, and A BCA = A DCA ;
that is, AC bisects each of the a' BAD, BCD.
3. Join AC.
Then in the A* ABC, CDA,
{AB=CD, by hypothesis,
andBC=DA, „
and AC is common to both ;
/. the a ABC=the ACDA. [Th. 7.]
4. (i) Join AD.
Then in the A’ABD, ACD,
{AB=AC, by hypothesis,
and BD = CD, „
and AD is common to both ;
.’. AABD=the aACD. [Th. 7.]
(ii) The second case is similarly proved.
5. In the A‘ BAD, CAD,
)BA=CA, by hypothesis,
and AD is common to both ;
also BD = CD ;
.-. the a BAD=the A CAD, [Th. 7.]
and the A BDA=the A CDA.
6. Let ABC be an isosceles triangle, and X, Y the middle points
of the equal sides AC, AB. Join BX, CY.
Then in the A" YBC, XCB,
)YB = XC, being halves of equal sides ;
and BC is common to both ;
also L YBC = L XCB; [Th. 5.)
.-. YC=XB. [Th. 4.]


7. In the base BC of the isosceles A ABC, let D and E be two
points such that BD = CE. Join AD, AE.
Then in the A’ ABD, ACE,
f ab=ac, [Hyp.]
because-! BD = CE, [Uyp.\
[ and z. ABD=z. ACE ; [ Th. 5.]
AD=AE. [Th. 4.]
8. In the equilateral A ABC, let D, E, Fbe the middle points of
the sides BC, CA, AB, respectively. Join DE, EF, FD.
Then in the A' FAE, FBD,
FA = FB, [Hy P .\
because - and AE = BD, being halves of equal sides ;
.andi FAE =L FBD ; [Th. 5, Cor. 2.]
FE = FD. [Th. 4.]
Similarly FD=DE ; the A FDE is equilateral.
9. Let ABC be an isosceles triangle, and let 80, CO bisect the
base U ABC, ACB.
(i) Then the L ABC=the L ACB, [Th. 5.]
/. the z.OBC = the Z.OCB, being halves of equal angles ;
.-. OB=OC. [Th. 6,]
(ii) Again in the A' ABO, AGO,
I" AB=AC, [Hyp.]
because -I and BO = CO, by (i),
[ and L ABO =L AGO, being halves of equal angles ;
.'. the L BAO=the l CAO. [Th. 4]
10. Let the diagonals of the rhombus ABCD intersect at X.
Then, as in Ex. 2, the A* BAC, DAC may be shewn equal
in all respects by Theor. 7. .’. the l BAC=the L DAC.
Then in the A' BAX, DAX,
[ BA=DA, [Hyp.]
because -! and AX is common ;
[ and l DAX ;
BX =DX ; and the L AXB=the IAXD : [Th. 4.]
and these angles, being adjacent, are rt. U.


11. In the A' FAB, EAC,
C FA=EA, [Hyp.]
because 4 and AB=AC,
[ and l FAB= L EAC ; \Th. 3.]
FB=EC. [Th. 4.]
Page 27.
3. Theoretically by Theorem 4. Experimentally by drawing
one of the triangles on tracing paper and superposing
it on the other.
4. If the drawing and measurements are accurate, the values
found for b, c, and A in the second triangle should agree
with the values given in the first triangle.
Hence we conclude that a triangle is completely determined
from either of the following data :
(i) two sides and the included angle ; [Compare
(ii) two angles and the side which joins them. Th. 4, I 1 ?.]
7. Draw a horizontal line AB, 3'o" long, to represent the distance
between the foot of the pole B and the extremity of the
shadow A. At A make an angle BAD=42°. From B
draw BC perp. to AB and meeting AD in C. Then C
represents the position of the top of the pole. By measure-
ment BC=2 - 7", and therefore the height of the pole is 27 ft.
8. Thh figure is drawn on one-third the given scale. If drawn
on the required scale, it will be found by measurement
that DA=4 - 24", nearly ; and the L DAB =l3s°.
.'. DA represents 424 yards, and since AD bisects the angle
between AN and AW, the bearing of D from A is N.W.


9. A convenient scale to use is that of 1 inch to 100 yds.
[The diagram is given to half
this scale.]
It will then be found by measure-
ment that
AB = 2'81", AC = 1-55",
and AD (drawn from A perp.
toBC) = l - 53". Hence the dis-
tances represented by these
lines are 281 yds., 155 yds., and 153 yds. respectively.
10. A convenient scale is that in which 1 inch represents 100 yds.
Using this, draw CB of length 3 - 2", and with the protractor
make L BCA = 42°. Cut
off CA = 2'45", and join
AB. [The diagram is
given to half this scale.]
Then AB represents the
distance between the
two places. By mea-
surement on the figure,
AB is found to be 2 - 14",
nearly; hence the dis-
tance between the two places is 214 yds.
Page 29.
1. Take any point Din the base BC and join AD.
Then in the A ABD, int. z. ABD < ext. /.ADC, [Th. B.]
and in the A ADC, int. Z.ACD<ext. Z.ADB. [Th. B.]
.’. the L’ ABD, ACD are together less than the Z." ADC, ADB,
that is, less than two right angles. [Th. I.]
2. (i) Produce BD to meet AC in K.
Then in the A DKC, ext. L BDC>int. opp. L DKC; [Th. B.]
and in the A AKB, ext. L DKC > int. opp. L BAG. [Th. B.]
Still more then is the L BDC > the L BAC.
(ii) Produce Ab to meet BC at X.
Then in the A BAD, ext. L BDX > int. opp. L BAD ; [Th. B.]
and in the A DAC, ext. z_XDC>int. opp. L DAC. [Th. B.]
.’. adding these results, the whole l BDC> the L BAC.


3. In the A ABC let BC be produced to D and CB to E.
Then the /.'ABE, ABC together = 2 rt. A ; \Th. I.]
also the A ACD, ACB together = 2 rt. A ;
hence the A ABE, ABC, ACD, ACB = 4 rt. A ;
and of these, the A ABC, ACB are together less than 2 rt. A ;
\Th. 8, Cor. I.]
the A ABE, ACD are together greater than 2 rt. A.
4. Let ABC be the given line and O the given point outside it:
and let OA, 08, OC be three lines, supposed all equal,
drawn from O to the line.
Then because OA =OC ; .'. /.OAC = /.OCA; \Tk. 5.]
and because OA =OB ; ;. /.OAB=/.OBA; [771. fi.]
hence L OCA = /,OBA. But this is impossible by Theor. 8 ;
for one of these angles is an ext. angle of the AOBC and
the other its int. opp. angle.
.'. more than two equal straight lines cannot be drawn from
O to AB.
5. In an isosceles triangle each of the equal angles is acute ; for
by Theor. 8, Cor. 1 their sum is less than two rt. angles.
.'. each of the ext. A at the base is the supplement of an
acute angle, and is consequently obtuse.
Page 34.
1, From Theor. 8, Cor. 2it follows that every triangle must have
at least two acute angles ; .'. the rt. angle is the greatest
angle ; the hypotenuse, which is opposite to the rt. angle,
is the greatest side. [7%. 10.]
2. Let ABC be a triangle and BC its greatest side. Then, by
Theor. 9, since BC is greater than either AB or AC
we have the L BAG greater than either the L BCA or the
/.ABC. Thus if either of these angles is obtuse, the
L BAC is also obtuse ; and we have two angles of a triangle
whose sum is greater than two rt. angles; which is
impossible by Theor. 8, Cor. 1. Hence each of the angles
ABC, BCA is acute.


3. Let ABC be the triangle and BD, DC the lines drawn from
B and Cto a point D within the triangle. Produce BD to
meet AC in X.
From the A DXC, DX + XC> DC. [Th. 11.]
Add BD to each side ; then BX +XC> BD + DC.
Also from the A BAX, BA+A X > BX.
Add XC to each side ; then BA +AOBX + XC.
Hence BA+AOBD+DC.
4. Since AB=AC, [Th. 5.]
But in the A ACD, ext. /_ACB>int. opp. Z.ADB ; [Th. B.]
.'. the L ABD > the l ADB ;
.-. AD>AB. [Th. 10.]
5. Let ABCD be a quadrilateral having AB the least side, and CD
the greatest. Join BD.
Then since DA >AB [Hyp\ /.ABD>/.ADB; [Th. 9.]
and since DC >BC [Hyp.\ ■■ /- DBC > L BDC ;
.'. the whole L ABC > the whole L ADC.
So, by joining AC, the L BAD may be shewn> the /.BCD.
6. Let AX be drawn to meet the base in X.
Then since AC is not greater than AB,
.". AC is equal to, or less than AB ;
the L ABC is equal to, or leas than, the L ACB. [Th. 5 and 9.]
But ext. /.AXB is greater than int. opp. /.ACB, [Th. B.]
the /.AXB is greater than the Z.ABX ;
;. AB is greater than AX. [Th. 10.]
7. Let AB be> AC, then the /.ACB>the /.ABC ; [Th. 9.]
hence the L OCB> the l OBC; OB> OC. [Th. 10.]
8. In the A ABC, BC is less than the sum of BA and AC. [Th. 11.]
Take AC from each of these unequals ; then the difference of
BC and AC is less than BA.
9. Let ABC be the triangle, and O any point.
In the A CAB, OA+OB> AB [Th. 11.]
in the A OBC, OB+OC> BC ;J- add these results ;
in the A OCA, OC+OA >CA
.‘. twice the sum of OA, 08, OC > the sum of AB, BC, CA,
i.e. the sum of OA, 08, OC > half the perim. of the A ABC.


10. Let AC, BD be the diagonals of the quad 1 ABCO.
Then from the A ABC, AB+BC>AC ; [Th. 11.]
and from the A ADC, AD +DO AC;
, by addition, the perimeter > twice AC.
Similarly, the perimeter > twice BD.
, by addition, twice perimeter > twice sum of diagonals.
perimeter > sum of diagonals.
11. In the A ABC, let AX bisect the L BAG and meet BC at X.
Then ext. <lAXC>int. opp. L BAX ; [Th. B.]
/.AXC is also>z_CAX ; [Hyp.']
:. AC> XC. [Th. 10.]
Similarly, AB>BX;
, by addition, AB, AC together > BC.
12. Let obe any point within the A ABC. Produce AO to meet
BC in X.
Then AC+CX>AX [Th. 11.]. AC+CB>AX+XB.
But OX+XB>OB [Th. 11.]. .-. AX+XB>AO+OB.
Hence AO +BO <AC + BC, 1
similarly BO+CO <BA + CA, J-
and CO+AO<CB+AB
/., by addition, twice the sum of OA, 08, OC is less than twice
the sum of AB, BC, CA ;
or OA +OB + OC<AB+BC+CA.
13. Let Obe the given pt., AC and BD the diagonals ;
then AO +OC > AC, [Th. 11.]
and BO+OD>BD; [Th. 11.]
by addition, OA + OB+OC + OD>AC + BD.
The exceptional case is when O is at the intersection of the
diagonals.
14. Let ABC be the triangle, AD the median bisecting BC. Produce
AD to E, making DE=AD. Join EC.
Then, by Theorem 4, we can prove the A* ADB, EDO equal in
all respects, and /. AB=CE.
But AC+CE>AE ; [Th. 11.]
/. AG+AB>2AD.


15. With the Figure of last example let BF, CH be the medians
bisecting AC, AB respectively.
Then, as in Ex. 14, we can prove AB + AC>2AD,'j
similarly BC + BA>2BF, J-
and CA + CB>2CH.J
by addition, twice sum of the sides > twice sum of the
medians ; that is, the sum of the medians is less than
the perimeter.

L Since z_EGB = Gs°, its supplementary angle BGH = 125°. [ Th. I.]
Because AB, CD are par 1 ; L GHC = alt, L BGH. [Th. 14. J
/.GHC = 125°.
Because AB, PQ are par 1 ; int. L HKQ = ext. L EGB, [Th. 14.]
/. HKQ = 56°.
.-. Z.QKF, being supplementary to L HKQ, is 125°. [Th. I.]
2. Let each of the st. lines AB, CD be perp. to a st. line which
meets them at P and Q.
Then the /_• APQ, PQD are equal, being rt. angles ; and since
these angles are alternate, .'. AB and CD are parallel.
[Th. 13.]
3. Let PQ meet the parallels AB, CD at P and Q, and let PQ be
perp. to AB.
Then since AB and CD are par 1 , and PQ meets them,

4. Let ABC be any angle, and PQR an angle formed by two
lines PQ, QR par 1 to AB, BC respectively.
First, when the /.‘ABC, PQR are either both acute or both
obtuse.
Let PQ, produced if necessary, cut BC at X.
Then since AB and PQ are par 1 , and BXC meets them ;
.'. L PXC = corresponding /.ABC. [Th. 14.]
But since BC and QR are par 1 , and PXQ meets them ;
.'. /.PXC = corresponding/.PQR. [Th. 14.]
i/ABC = /.PQR.


Next, when the angles ABC, PQR are one acute and one obtuse.
Produce PQ to meet BC at S. Then the /.’ABC, RQS are
either both acute or both obtuse.
, as in the first case, L ABC =L RQS.
But /.' RQS, PQR are supplementary. [Th. ].]
/.’ABC, PQR are supplementary.

5. Let XY cut the equal sidesfAß, AC of the isosceles A ABC at

Then since XY, BC are par 1 , and AXB meets them,
ext. z.AXY=int. opp. /.ABC. [Th. 14.]
Similarly the /.AYX = the /.ACB.
But the /.ABC=the z_ACB [Th 5] ; .-. the /.AXY=the /. AYX.
7. Let Pbe any point in the bisector of the /.AOB ; and let PQ
be drawn par 1 , to 08.
Then since 08, PQ are par 1 , and OP meets them,

8. Let AD be the bisector of the l BAC.
Then the A’ BAD, CAD can be proved equal in all respects by
Theor. 4; and .'. l. ADB =l ADC; that is, AD is perp. to BC.
Thus AD and ZYX, being both perp. to BC, are parallel;
.'. L BAD=alt. l AY2; 1 [Th. 14 1

.-. /.AYZ=/.AZY.. .'. AY=AZ. [Th. 6.]
9. In the A ABC, let BA be produced to D ; and let AX bisect
the L CAD, and be par 1 to BC.
Then ext. = int. opp. L CBA r ff d Th 14 ]
and L XAC = alt. L BCA; i L J
but /.XAD = /.XAC [Hyp. - ]; /.CBA=/.BCA;
.-. AB = AC. [Th. 6.]


10. From O, any pt. on the bisector of l BAC, draw OP par 1 to AB
and OQ par 1 to AC.
Then, by Theor. 14, U POA, QOA are equal to z.*QAO, PAO
respectively.
But L PAO= L QAO. [Hyp.]
the four angles are all equal.
Now imagine the A AOQ folded over about AO. Then because
L QAO = L PAO, the line AQ coincides in direction with the
line AP.
Similarly OQ coincides in direction with OP.
.‘. Q, the common pt. of AQ and QO, must coincide with P
the common pt. of AP and PO.
the A’ AOP, AOQ coincide, and .'. AQ=AP, and OP=OQ.
But L PAO = L POA ; [Proved] .-. AP=PO. [Th. 6.]
Hence the four sides AP, PO, OQ, QA are all equal. Thus the
figure is equilateral, and is therefore a rhombus.
[Exceptional case. If the given angle is a right angle, the
resulting figure is a square.]
11. Let Dbe the pt. of intersection of AB and CD ;
then z.XYD=alt. [Th. 14, and Hyp.]
:. XY = XD. [Th. 6.]
Similarly XD = XZ ;
.-. YX=XZ.
12. The lines PA, QB turn through 72°, 60° respectively per sec.
Hence the line PA turns through 12° more per sec. than QB.
Now when PA is again parallel to QB, and pointing in the
opposite direction, it must have turned through 180° more
than QB.
Hence the time taken in this case is or 15 seconds.
Again, when PA and QB are both pointing the same way the
angle gained by PA is 360°.
Thus the time taken is or 30 seconds.

3. To construct the triangle, draw any line AB : at a pt. Pin
AB make z.APK = 94°; and at any pt. Q in BP make
/-BQL = 126°. Then if PK and QL cut at R, PQR is the
required triangle. The interior angles at P, Q are the
supplements of 94° and 126° respectively, viz. 86 3 and 54°.
Hence R = 180°-(B6°+ 54°) = 40°.
4. Here the vertical angle A = 180° -162° = 18°
also B+‘C = 162°; B-C = 60°; whence B = 111°, C = 51°.

Also L QCB= 180° 62° = 118°; and .'. L KCB=s9°.

8. The sum of the four angles of a quad 1 can be shewn to be

a diagonal).
Hence A+2A+3A + 4A = 360°; whence A =36°,

By Theor. 5, the z.A = the L C, and each is acute.
Again since h is less than each of the other sides, the -L B is
less than each of the other angles [Th. 9]; .'. all the
three angles are acute.
4. The Theorems are 6 and 10.
(i) C= 180°-(4B°+ 51°)=81°.
Thus C being the greatest angle, c will be the greatest side.
[Th. 10.]
(ii) C = 180°-(62£° + 62i°) = 55°.
.Thus l A being greater than L C we have a is greater than c.
[Th. 10.]
And/.A=Z.B; .’. a— h. [Th. 6.]
Hence a, h are equal, and each greater than c.

6. See pp. 50, 51.
7. It will be noticed that in each of the four theorems which
prove two triangles congruent (Theors. 4,7, 17, 18) we
have given three parts of one triangle equal to three parts
of the second triangle, and that these three relations are
independent, i.e. no one of them is simply a consequence of
the existence of the other two. This may be summarised
by saying that in order to prove two triangles congruent
we must have at least three independent relations between
their several parts. [N.B. The existence of any three
such relations does not prove congruence. See (ii), p. 50.]


Now in the case given us the three relations are not in-
dependent ; for if two angles of the first triangle are
equal to two angles of the second triangle, each to each, the
the third angles also must be equal by Theor. 16, and the
third relation is thus only a consequence of the first two.
Hence without some further data we cannot conclude that
the triangles are congruent.
8. (i) See Theor. 12.
(ii) In the Fig. of Theor. 12, let OQ be an oblique such that
,ICOQ = z.COP.
Then the complements of these angles are also equal,
that is, I OQC=/. OPC ; [Th. 16.]
OP = OQ. [Th. 6 ]
(iii) Let OR, OP be obliques on opposite sides of OC, such that
L ROC is greater than z. POC.
Then Z.ORC being the conipt, of z. ROC is less than OPC
which is the corapt. of L POC.
OR is greater than OP. [ Th. 10.]
Also if OR, OQ be obliques on the same side of OC, such that
<ICOR is greater than L COQ ; make, on the opposite side
of OC, an l COP = l COQ.
Then OP =OQ by (ii), and OR>OP by the above ;
OR > OQ.
9. Let ABC, DEF be two triangles having BA, AC equal to
ED, DF, each to each, and L ABC = z_ DEF.
Then if z.BAC = Z.EDF, the triangles are congruent by
Theor. 17, and .-. Z.ACB = Z.DFE.
But if l BAG is not equal to the let Z.BAC be the
greater, and at D draw a line DG, making with ED an
angle EDG = z. BAG, and cutting EF produced at G.
Then the A" BAG, EDG are congruent by Theor. 17.
.'. DG=AC, and L DGF = z.ACB.
But DF=AC [lTyp.~\-, :. DG=DF; and l DGF =z. DFG.
[Th. 5.]
Now the z. 8 DFE,.DFG are supplementary. [Th. I.]
.’. the L DFE, DGF are supplementary.
That is, the z." DFE, ACB are supplementary.


12. Draw a line CD 2 - 7 cm. long to represent 27 ft.
At C with DC produced make and at D make
z_BDA = 40°. [The diagram is
given to half this scale.]
Let CA, DA cut at A. From A draw
AB perp. to CD and meeting DC
produced in B. Then AB is
found by measurement to be
3 7 cm.
Hence the height of the flagstaff is
37 ft.
13. First set off a line PQ, T 26" long, to represent the lighthouse.
From Q draw QR perp. to PQ. Then A, B lie on QR.
[The diagram is on half this scale.]
Now since <IPAQ=S7°, the /.QPA
= 90°-57° = 33°.
Thus at P draw PA, mating /-QPA
= 33°, to cut QR at A.
Similarly draw PB, making Z.QPB
= 90° - 33° = 57°, to cut QR at B.
Then by measurement the distance
between A and B is IT2" which on the given scale repre-
sents 112 ft.
14. Set off AB in S.E. direction

sent the distance be-
tween the two ships.

sects the angle between

1. In quad 1 ABCD, if BD is joined,
I AB = CD,
because -! AD = CB,
[ BD is common,
A' BAD, DCB are identically equal. [Th. 7.]
;. /.ABD = /_CDB,
.’. AB is par 1 to CD. [Th. 13.]
AB and DC are equal and parallel; hence, by Theor. 20,
it follows that ABCD is a par" 1 .
2. In the quad 1 ABCD,
let l DAB=/. BCD,
and /.ABC=z.ADC ;
then the sum of two adjacent L B =£ sum of the of fig. ABCD
= 2 rt. U ; [ Th. 16. Inf. 5.]
the opposite sides are parallel. [7%. 13.]
3. Let AC, BD be the diagonals, bisecting each other at O.
Then in A' ADD, COB,
f AO=CO,
because-! andOD = 08, [Hyp.]
i and Z.AOD—vert. opp. /.COB ; [Th. 3.]
.-. AD = CB,
and/.OAD=/.OCB. [Th. 4.]
But these are alternate angles ; .■. AD is par 1 to BC. [Th. 13.]
Hence AD, BC are equal and parallel, and .'. the figure
ABCD is a par m . [Th. 20.]
4. Let ABCD be a rhombus, and O the intersection of its
diagonals. Then we have in the A* AOD, COD,
I AO=CO, [Th. 21. Cor. 3.]
because -{ and DO is common,
[ andAD=CD; [//yp.]
.-. z.AOD=/.COD ; [Th. 7.]
and these being adjacent angles, each is a rt. l ;
.'. DB is perp. to AC.


5. In the quad 1 ABCD, let AC= BD.
Then in the A“ ABC, DCB,
f AB=DC,
because ■! BC is common,
[ and AC= DB ;
ABC = i— DCB [Th. 7] ; each is a rt. L. [Th. 14]
6. Because the sum of the /.“ABC, BCD is two rt. U [Th. 14] and
neither is a rt. L, :. they are unequal.
Then in the A" ABC, DCB,
I AB=DC, [Th. 21.]
because I and BC is common,
( but L ABC is unequal to l DCB ;
.'. AC, BD are unequal. [Th. 19.]
Page 60.
1. Let AC be a diagonal of the rhombus ABCD.
Then the A’ ABC, ADC are congruent. [Th. 7.]
.-. /.CAB = z_CAD.
Similarly 4ACB = z.ACD.
Hence if the figure is folded about the diagonal AC, AD will
coincide in direction with AB, and CD will coincide in
direction with CB.,
Thus D, the common pt. of AD, DC, must coincide with B, the
common pt. of AB, BC.
the A s ABC, ADC can be niade to coincide, and hence the
rhombus is symmetrical about the diagonal AC and,
similarly, also about BD.
2. As in Ex. 1. we can prove that each diagonal of a square
bisects the angles through which it passes, and that there-
fore the triangles on either side of a diagonal coincide
when the figure is folded about that diagonal.
Hence a square is symmetrical about either diagonal.
The other axes of symmetry are the lines joining the middle
pts. of opposite sides.
3. The triangles though congruent are not similarly placed with
regard to the diagonal. For since two adjacent sides of a
rectangle are unequal, they cannot coincide when the


figure is folded about the diagonal through their pt. of
intersection. Thus this diagonal, and similarly the other
also, cannot be an axis of symmetry.
The only axes in this case are the lines joining the middle pts.
of opposite sides;
4. Let ABCD be an oblique par m ; E, F the mid-pts. of AB and
CD.
Then since DA, DC are unequal, they cannot coincide when
the figure is folded about DB. Thus the diagonals are not
axes of symmetry.
Again the lines AE, DF are equal, for they are halves of equal
lines AB, CD; and .'. EF is parallel to AD. [Th. 20 ]
Hence the z.BEF=the int. opp. L BAD [ Th. 14], and is ;. not
a rt. angle. [Hyp-]
:. the L’ BEF, AEF are unequal.
Hence the lines EB, EA do not coincide when the figure is
folded abofit EF.
Thus the lines joining the mid-pts. of opposite sides are
not axes of symmetry ; and no axes of symmetry exist.
5. Since BA, BC are unequal, the figure is not symmetrical
about BD.
But in the A 8 BAC, DAC,
[ AB=AD, Wyp.]
because] and CB = CD,
[ and AC is common ;
.'. z.BAC=/_DAC; and /_BCA=z.DCA. [Th. 7.]
Thus these triangles coincide when the figure is folded about
AC, and AC is therefore an axis of symmetry.
6. (i) Let ABCD, EFGH be par' 118 in which AB = EF, BC=FG ;
and /.ABC=/. EFG. Join AC, EG.
Then the A ABC can be made to coincide with the A EFG
[Th. 4], and the A ADC will then coincide with the
A EHG. [Th. 7.]
Hence the two par™ 8 coincide, and are therefore identically
equal.
(ii) Let ABCD, EFGH be two rectangles, in which AB =EF
and BC = FG.
Then the ABC = the L EFG, being both rt. L'.
Hence the example is a particular case of (i).


7. Apply the A BAD to the A FEH so that A falls on E and AB
along EF. Then, since l. BAD =z. FEH, the line AD will
fall along EH ; and, because AB =EF and AD = EH, the
pts. B, D will fall on F and H. Also the A S BDC, FHG
are congruent by Theor. 7 ; hence L BDC =.L FHG, and
L DBC =z. HFG. Thus BC, DC fall on FG, HG respectively
and C coincides with G. Thus the quadrilaterals
coincide.
8. Let ABCD he the par™, O the middle pt. of the diag. BD, and
POQ a st. line through O terminated by the sides APB,
CQD.
Then in A* POB, QOD,
f l POß=vert. opp. /.QOD, [Th. 3.]
because -j and L OBP = alt. L ODQ, [Th. 14.]
and BO = CD; [Byp]
/. PO = OQ. [Th. 17.]
9. Let AP, CQ be perp. to diag. BD. Then
f z.ADP=alt. [ Th. 14.]
because 4 and z. APD=z_CQB, being rt. Z_“,
[ and AD = CB; [Th. 21.]
A* APD, CQB are identically equal, [Th. 17.]
.-. AP = CQ.
10. AX and YC are equal, being halves of the equal sides AD and
BC. They are also parallel. Hence AY is par 1 to CX, and
.-. AYCX is a par™. [Th. 20.]
11. Join BE, AD, CF.
Then, because AB is equal and parallel to DE ;
AD is equal and par 1 to BE. [Th. 20.]
Similarly CF is equal and par 1 to BE.
AD andCF are both equal and parallel. [Th. 15.]
.". AC, DF are both equal and parallel. [Th. 20.]
•
12. In the Fig. considered, CD is greater than AB.
From A, B draw AP, BQ perp. to CD. Then APQB is a par™,
and .'. AP=BQ.
Then in the rt.-angled A 5 APD, BQC,
because hypot. AD = hypot. BC, and AP= BQ ;
.-. and PD = Cd; [Th. 18.]


(i) Hence Z.A + Z.C = Z_BAD + Z.ADP=IBO°. [Th. 14.]
Similarly zL B+ z. D = 180°.
.-. z.A+zlC = z.B + Z.D.
(ii) Adding PQ to the equal lengths PD, CQ, we have QD = PC.
Hence in the A 8 BQD, APC,
[ BQ = AP,
because-] and QD = PC,
( and L BQD=z_ APC, being rt. U ;
.-. BD = AC. [ Th. 4.]
(iii) Also, if X is the mid-pt. of AB, and Y the ruid-pt. of PQ,
and .'. also of CD, then it can be shewn by .Theor. ‘2O
that XY is par* to AP and in consequence perp. to CD
and AB.
Moreover XA = XB, and YD = YC.
Hence if the figure be folded over about the line XY, the
lines XA, YD will fall along XB and YC and be ter-
minated at B and C; that is, the figure is symmetrical
about XY.
13, Since the lines are initially parallel, the alternate angles
BAP, ABQ are equal by Theor. 14.
Let AP', BQ' be the new positions of AP, BQ at the end of any
time.
(i) Then, since the rods are turning at equal rates, the angles
through which they have turned, viz. z." PAP', QBQ,
are equal. •
Hence, by subtraction, the 2J BAP', ABQ' are equal.
And these are alternate angles ; .’. AP' is par 1 to BQ'.
Thus the lines are always parallel.
(ii) Join P'Q' cutting AB in C.
Then in the A" ACP', BCQ'
f z.ACP' = vert. opp. Z.BCQ', [Th. 3.]
because-] Z_CAP' = Z_CBQ', [Proved^]
[andAP'=BQ';
AC = BC. [Th. 17.]
Hence C is the mid-pt. of AB and is therefore a fixed pt.
Thus the line joining the ends of the rods always passes
through a fixed pt.


14. We have —A), whence A=s4°.
.'. B+ C = 126°. {Th. 16.]
But B=f 0 ; .’. J 0 = 126°, whence 0 = 54°, and B = 72°.
15. In the diagram P, Q, R, 8, T
represent the pts. at which
the yacht changes her course,
and TK her final direction.
QP is produced to meet TK
at U. Then since TK is par 1
to OP,
.-. l PUK=z.QPE = 63°.
Now QRSTU forms a pentagon
and the sum of its ext.
angles = 360°. {Th. 16. Cor. 2.]
But the ext. angles at Q, R, S,
U =324°;
ext. angle at T = 360° - 324° = 36°.
Thus the yacht must change her course by 36°.
16. The sum of the ext. angles of the figure = 4 rt. U.
{Th. 16. Cor. 2.]
sum of the int. angles is also 4 rt. L‘. [//yjo.]
Hence the sum of the ext. and int. angles = 8 rt. L“.
But the ext. and int. angles at any vertex = 2 rt. z. 8 .

17. The sum of the int. angles of the five-sided figure = 2x5 —4,

18. (i) The lines AP, BQ are par 1 when L PAB + Z.QBA=IBO°.

Now the sura of iJ PAB, QBA is increased by 7£° + 3|°, that is

(ii) Angle between AP and BQ = suppt. of the sum of
U PAB, QBA, [7%. 16.]

= 45°.
(iii) The angle between AP and BQ diminishes each second by
the amount by which the sum of £j BAP, QBA is increased ;
for the sum of the 3 angles is constant.
Hence the rate of decrease is 11|° per second.

3. With the Fig. and construction of Ex. 2, we can prove the
A s AYZ, CYV congruent by Theor. 4.
.-. Z Y=V Y, CV = AZ, and L YCV = u YAZ ;
and these being alt. angles, CV is par 1 to AB. [ Th. 13.]
But AZ =ZB [Hyp.]. :. CV=BZ.
Thus CV is both equal and parallel to BZ ;
.-. CVZB is a par'". [Th. 20.]
.-. BC =ZV = 2ZY.
4. In the Fig. of Ex. 1 let X, Y, Zbe the mid-pts. of the aides.
Then, by Ex. 2, ZY is par 1 to BX, and XY is par 1 to BZ.
Thus BZYX is a par 1 ", and XZ being a diagonal, the A' BZX,
YXZ are identically equal. [Th. 21.]
Similarly the A B AZY, YXC are identically equal to A XYZ.
.'. all four triangles are identically equal.
5. In the Fig. of Ex. 2 let ADE be a st. line cutting ZY in D and
BC in E.
Then ZY is par 1 to BC. [Ex. 2.]
.'., in A ABE, the line ZY drawn through the mid-pt. Zof AB,
parallel to the base BE, bisects the third side AE. [Ex. I.]
6. Let AC meet BX in E and DY in F.
Then BY and XD are par 1 , and also equal, being halves of
equal sides.
.'. BX is par 1 to YD. [Th. 20.]
Then from A BEC, because YF is par 1 to BE ; .’. CF = EF.
[Ex. I.]
And in A AFD, because XE is par 1 to DF ; .'. AE = EF.
[Ex. I.]
AC is trisected at E, F.


7. In the quad 1 ABCD, let P, Q, R, Js be middle pts. of sides AB,
BC, CD, DA respectively. Then by Ex. 2, PQ and SR are
each par 1 to AC, and PS and QR are each par 1 to BD.
8. In last Ex., PR and QS are diags. of a par m , and therefore
bisect each other. [ Th . 21. Cor. 3.]
9. Through A draw ALM, par 1 to CD, cutting OX, BQ (produced
if necessary) in L and M.
Then AP, OX, BQ are par 1 , for they are all perp. to CD.
.'. PXLA, LXQM are par ma .
.-. AP=LX = MQ, and LX=|(AP+MQ).
Also by Theor. 22. Cor., or Ex. 3, because Ovis the mid-pt. of
side AB of A ABM and OL is drawn par 1 to side BM,
/. OL = JBM.
.’. in case (i), by addition,
0X = OL+LX = i(BM+AP+MQ)=4(AP+BQ),
and in case (ii), by subtraction,
OX=OL- LX = i{BM*> (MQ + AP),
Thus in the numerical Ex.,
OX = J(5 - 8 + 4'2)cm. = 5 cm., if A, B are on the same side of CD.
OX=^(s - 8 —4'2)cm. = o‘B cm., if A, Bare on opposite sides of CD
10. With the Fig. of Theor. 22, where the three parallels AB, CD,
EF cut off equal intercepts XY, YZ and PQ, QR respectively
fr om the two transversals XZ, PR, we have
because PXMQ, QYNR are par m ‘,
.-. PX=QM and QY = RN.
Also MY=NZ ; [Th. 22.]
.-. PX +RZ=QM+ QY + NZ
=QM+QY + MY
=2QY.
That is, QY is the Arith. Mean between PX, RZ.
11. Let P, Qbe the middle pts. of AB, CD, the slant sides of the
trapezium ABCD.
Then, by Theor. 22, the line drawn through P par 1 to AD must
bisect CD, i.e. passes through Q ; hence PQ is par 1 to AD.
.'. by Ex. 10, PQ is the Arith. Mean between a and b and its

12. Let la, 25, 3c, 4c?, 5e be the five parallels.
Through 1,2, 4, 5 draw IP, 2Q, 4R, 5S par 1 to OY and meeting
3c, produced if necessary, in P, Q, R, S respectively.
Then by Theor. 17, the A" 13P, 53S are congruent. 3S=3P.
.-. la +sc = (3c 3P) + (3c + 3S)
= twice 3c.
Similarly 26 +4c?=twice 3c.
/. the five lines together=five times 3c ; that is, 3o is the
mean of the five parallels.
Similarly if (2b +1) parallels be so drawn the (« + l) th parallel
is the mean of all the (2b+ 1).
13. Let ABCD be the given par 1 ", and let AX, CY be perps. on the
given line from one pair of opp. U, and DP, BQ perps.
from the other pair of opp. l‘. Let the diagonals inter-
sect in E, and let EF be perp. to the given line.
Then AX+CY = 2EF [Ex. 9. p. 65.]

since E is the middle pt. of the diagonals. [Th. 21. Cor. 3.]
14. From Din the base BC let DE, DF be drawn perp. to AC, AB
respectively ; from B let BG be drawn perp. to AC.
Draw BH par 1 to AC to meet ED produced in H.
Then QH is a par 1 " by construction, and EH = BG.
Now because BH is par 1 to AC, l. HBD=alt. Z.ACB=Z.ABC.

If D lie on CB produced, we have DE « DF = BG.
15. Let OX, OY, OZ be perps. to BC, CA, AB respectively.
Through O draw POQ par’ to BC.
Through A draw AGH perp. to PQ and BC.
Then L‘ APQ, AQP are respectively equal to L‘ ABC, ACB ;

projections on any st. line.
Through A, C draw AE, CF par' to XY to meet BY, DQ in

1. Use the diagonal scale of inches as explained on pp. 66, 67.
3. Measuring the distance 5'7 cm. on the dividers and trans-
ferring to a diagonal scale of inches, it is found to be
equivalent to 2 - 24".
By calculation, 5 - 7 cm.=0'3937" x 5'7
= 2'244", to 3 dec. places.
4. By measurement, 3T5 inches = B’o cm.;
whence 1 cm. = 3T5"-7-8
=o'39", to 2 dec, places.
5. By measurement, 2‘9 cm. = IT4" ;
whence T' = 2 - 9 cm.-rIT4 = 2 - 543 cm.
Also by measurement, 6 2 cm. = 2’44";
whence T' = 6 - 2 cm.~2'44 = 2'541 cm.
Thus the average result is T' = 2 - 54 cm., to 2 dec. places.


6. The req 4 lines will be 3'36" and 4‘08". Measure these lengths

7. The req 4 lines will be 0 - 85", 2'98", 1 -01", which must be measured

Draw a line OX and set off 4 or 5 divisions, each 2 cm. long, to

At O draw OY perp. to OX and of any convenient length.
By means of Prob. 7 divide the first division of OX into
3 equal parts and OY into 12 equal parts.
Through the pts. of division on OY draw parallels to OX with

1. Describe an equil. A ABC, by taking any line BC and with
centres B, C, and radius BC, drawing arcs to cut at A.
Then the three angles are equal [ Th . s], and their sura is
180° [Th. 16] ; each is 60°.
Now bisect /.ABC by Prob. 1, and then bisect each of the two
parts.
2. (i) Let ABC be a rt. L. Cut off BC any convenient length on
one of the arms, and on BC describe an equil. A DBC.
Then L ABD = 90° - 60° = 30°.
Bisect L DBC by BK ; then L DBK =/. KBC = 30°.
Thus BD, BK trisect the rt. /.ABC.
(ii) Let PQR be an angle of 45°. Draw QS making with
QR an angle of 60°, on the same side as QP.
Bisect L SQR by QX ; and bisect L XQR by QY.
Then L PQR is trisected, for each of its three parts is 15°.


3. Use the construction of Prob. 7.

6. Bisect AB at C. Through C draw CD perp. to AB to meet XV
in D.
Join DA, DB.
Then the A’ACD, BCD are congruent by Theor. 4.
.'. DA, DB are equal, and D lies in XV.
The construction is impossible when XV is parallel to CD,
i.e. when XV is perp. to AB.
7. Bisect the L BAG by AD cutting XY in D. Through D draw
DP, DQ perp. to AB, AC.
Then the A* DAP, DAQ are congruent by Theor. 17.
.-. DP=DQ.
.-. D, a pt. on XY, is equidistant from AB, AC.
The construction is impossible if AD, XY are parallel, i.e. if
XY is parallel to the internal bisector of L. BAG.
8. At C, any pt. in AB, make the L BCD of the given magnitude.
Through P draw PQ par 1 to CD, and cutting AB in Q.
Then l PQB=£. DCB, by Theor. 14.
9. By Theor. 4. the A' PHK, P'HK are congruent.

3. Draw BC equal to 3'15" to represent 315 yds. At B make an
angle CBA equal to 39°, and cut off BA= 2‘6" to represent
260 yds. Then AC is found by measurement to be 2 - 00",
which represents 200 yds.
4. z. A=lBo° - (47°+ 68°)=65°.
Draw BC equal to 7‘5 cm. At B, C make angles CBA, BCA
■ equal to 47°, 68° respectively.
By measurement in the plan, AB=7 - 7 cm., AC=6 - 1 cm.; and
the perp. from A on BC = 5'6 cm.
Hence the corresponding lengths in the field are 77 m., 61 m.,
56 m.
5. The diagram is drawn to half the
given scale; A, B, C being
the three turning pts. of the
course.
By calculation AB = 3 knots, BC
=sj knots. Set off AB equal
to 6 cm. in direction N.E.
At B set off BC equal to 10|
cm. in direction N.W. Then
by measurement CA=l2 - 1
cm., and z_SCA=l5°, nearly.
Hence the distance from the
harbour=6'os knots, and the
new course is 15° E. of South.


6. See Prob. 10.
«/c 2 a 2 =V(lO - 6) 2 (5 - =9, which should be the num-
ber of centimetres in b as obtained by measurement.

7. See Prob. 9.
The two values of C must be supplementary ; for, in Prob. 9,
AC I =A0 2 , and z.AC 1 C 2 =/.AC 2 C 1 . But U AC 2 8, AC 2 C,
are supplementary ; AC 2 8, AC[B are supplementary.
8. Draw a line AX ;at A make L XAY equal to 50°; from AY cut
off AC equal to 6'5 cm. Then with centre C and the given
values of a as radii in turn, draw circles and note the pts.
where these meet AX.
In (i) there are 2 pts. of intersection, but on different sides of
A, so that one A has A = 50° and the other has A = 130°.
Hence there is only one solution.
In (ii) there are 2 pts. of intersection on same side of A.
Hence each possible A has A=so°, and there are tico
solutions.
In (iii) the 2 pts. of intersection coincide, as the © touches AX ;
hence one solution.
In (iv) the O does not cut AX at all, and there is no solution.
9. It will be seen that we have to draw a triangle rt.-angled at
A and with AB, BC given lengths. Hence use Prob. 10.
A convenient scale is 1 inch to 100 yds. It will then be
found, by measurement, that AC = 3'80"; thus the required
distance is 380 yds.
10. Draw the base AB, 4 cm. in length. Bisect AB at C. Draw
CD perp. to AB and equal to 6 - 2 cm. Then A ADB is
isosceles ; for by Theor. 4, the A 8 ACD, BCD are congruent,
and therefore DA=DB.
11. Let the magnitude of the given angle be denoted by X.
Draw AD of the given length representing the perp. from the
vertex A on the base. Through D draw BDC perp. to
AD. From A draw AB, AC on opp. sides of AD, making
¥
each of the z_ 8 DAB, DAC equal to —. Then the A ABC is
h
isos., for the A a ADB, ADC are congruent by Theor. 17 J
and the vert. L BAC =X. •


Draw AD of length 6 cm., and proceed as above making each
of the angles DAB, DAC equal to 30°. Then each angle of
the A is 60°.
12. Draw AD of length 50 cm. to represent the perp. from vertex
Aon the base. Through D draw BDC perp. to AD. With
A as centre draw one arc with radius 5"8 cm. cutting BC
in Bj, Ba and a second arc with radius 90 cm. cutting
BC in C 1( C 2.
Then each of the A’ABjCj, ABiC 2 , AB 2 C], AB 2 C 2 satisfies the
data, but it will be seen that they may be grouped in
pairs, each of one pair having its base 4'5 cm. while that
of each of the others is 10’4 cm.
13. Draw two par 1 lines BC, EF whose distance apart =P.
At any pt. A in EF make L EAB= L, and L FAC= M [Prob. s].
Then l EAB, and LhOB=L FAC [Th. 14],
ABC is the required A.
14. Draw AC equal to b. AtC make L ACK equal to LC. At any
pt. K in CK make L CKF on the same side of CK as A and
equal to LB. [Prob. s]. Through A draw AB par 1 to FK
and meeting CK in B.
Then [ Th. 14] ; and L CKF was made equal to
the given L B.
ABC is the required A.
15. Draw BC equal to the given base. At B make l CBA equal to
90° - |L. At C make L BCA also equal to 90°- £L. Then
A ABC is isosceles [Th. 6], and its vertical angle
= 180°-(B + C)=L.
16. Draw PB equal to the given length (a+6). At P draw PR
making L BPR=45°. With centre B and radius equal to c
describe a circle cutting PR in A, A'. From A, A' draw
perns. AC, A'C' to PB. Then either of the A“ ACB, A'C'B
will satisfy the given conditions.
For z_PAC=45° [Th. 16]; and /. Z.APC=Z.PAC, whence
CA=CP.
AC + CB = PB, and similarly A'C' + C'B = PB.
Note. There will be two, one, or no solutions according as cis
greater than, equal to, or less than the perp. from B to PR.
In the given case there are two solutions, but, as could be
proved in the general case, the A‘ are congruent, and the
lengths of the sides are 4 - 5 cm. and 2 - 8 cm.
ija? +b 2 = V(4-5) 2 +(2-8) 2 = v/28'09 = 5-3 cm.


17. Let B, Cbe the given base angles, PQ the given perimeter.
From P draw PA making L QPA =£ B.
From Q draw QA making L PQA = C.
From A draw AB making L PAB =Z.QPA, to cut PQ in B.
From A draw AC making L QAC =Z. PQA, to cut PQ in C.
Then BA =BP [Th. 6] ; ext. ABC = i BPA +£. PAB =B.
Similarly CA = CQ, and z.ACB =C.
/. ABC is the required A.
18. Draw an z.PBC = 60°. Cut off BC = 6 - scm., and BP=locm.
Join PC ; and from C draw CA cutting BP in A and making
/.PCA=z.BPC.
Then AP =AC [Th. 6], and BA +AC = BP.
Hence ABC is the required A.
19. Draw = 55°. Cut off BC = 7 cm., and BP = 1 cm.
Join PC ; and from C draw CA cutting BP produced in A, and
making /.PCA=Z.APC.
Then AC =AP [Th. 6], and .'. BA-AC=BP.
Hence ABC is the required A.
By measurement AB = 8 cm., AC = 7 cm.

1. On PQ as base, and on opp. sides of it, construct two equil.
A’PRQ, PSQ. Then the four sides of the figure PRQS are
all equal to the diagonal PQ. Also each angle of an
equil. A is 60°; .‘. RPQ; whence PR is par 1
to QS. Similarly RQ is par 1 to PS. Hence the figure
is a rhombus.
Each of the L' R, S=an angle of an equil. A. =6o°.
Each of the =sum of two angles of an equil. A. = 120°.
2. See p. 19, Ex. 3.
3. Let AB be the given diagonal. Bisect AB at O. Draw COD
perp. to AB, making OC=OD = OA. Then CADB is the
required square.
The four A s formed can be proved congruent by Theor. 4.,
hence the four lines AC, CB, BD, DA are all equal, and
the figure is equilateral.
In A AOC, L ACO = L OAC [ Th. 's] and their sum is 90° [ Th. 16],


each is 45°. Hence/.AGO = 45°; similarly l BCD = 45°.
.'. z_ACB = 90°. Similarly each of the other Uof the
figure is a rt. L. Thus the figure is both equilateral
and rectangular, and is .'. a square.
4. Construct a AAOB having AB = 5'5 cm., AO = 4 cm., 0B = 3 cm.
Produce AO, BO to C and D, so that OC =AO and
OD = 08. Then ABCD ■will be the required par™.
By Theor. 4 the A'ADD, COB are congruent.
Z-ODA=Z.OBC ; whence AD is par 1 to BC. [Th. 13.]
Similarly DC is par 1 to AB. By measurement AD = 4 - 4 cm.
5. The five independent data are the four segments of the two
diagonals, and the angle at which the lines cut.
Let AOC, BOD be the diagonals, and the z_AOD = 60°. Then
by Theors. 4 and 13 we can prove AD par 1 to BC, and AB
par 1 to CD. Hence the figure is a par m .
By measurement AD = 3’o cm., AB = 5'2 cm. Thus the peri-
meter=2(AD + AB) = 16 - 4 cm.
In the second case, by measurement, each side = 4’24 cm., thus
the perimeter = 16'97 cm.
0*57
.'. increase per cent. = x 100 = 3'4, nearly.
6. By assuming different magnitudes for the angle BAD and
proceeding as in Prob. 11, we should get several quad-
rilaterals differing in shape but each satisfying the given
conditions. Hence the shape is not completely determined
by the data.
If A=loo°, it will be found that the length of DB is greater
than 6‘5 cm. Hence circles with centres D, B and radii
4'o cm. and 2 - 5 cm. respectively do not intersect.
If BD is equal to 6'5 cm., the two circles will meet at a point C
on the line BD. For any value of BD greater than 6'5 cm.
the construction fails ; thus when BD is least the fig.
reduces to a triangle BAD with AD = 3'3 cm., AB = 5 - 6 cm.,
DB=6's cm., whence we find by measurement that A=9o°.
7. Let BD be the given diagonal. First construct a A with
sides equal to DA, AB, BD, and then on the other side of
BD draw a A whose remaining sides are equal to DC, CB.
By Theor. 11, any side of a A must be loss than the sum of
the other two sides, and also greater than their difference.
Thus BD must be greater than a**d and 6»c, and less
than a+ d and 6+ c.

1. The locus is a concentric circle, whose radius is equal to the
sum or difference of the radius of the given circle and the
given distance.
2. Join AB and bisect it at C ; draw CD perp. to AB meeting RQ
in P. Then this is the req d pt. ; for every pt. on CD is
equidistant from A and B. [ Prob . 14.]
3. All pts. which are equidistant from A and B lie on the st. line
which bisects AB at rt. U. The intersections of this line
and the circumference give two pts., each of which satisfies
the given conditions.
4. Produce AB and CD to meet in O. Draw OX, OY the internal
and external bisectors of L BOD. By Prob; 15, any pt. on
either of these lines is equidistant from AB and CD.
The intersections of OX, OY with RQ therefore give two
positions of the pt. P.
5. All pts. 4 cm. distant from A lie on a©, centre A, radius 4 cm.
All pts. 5 cm. distant from B lie on a O, centre B, radius 5 cm.
The common pts. of the two circles are the pts. required.
6. All pts. 3 cm. distant from AB lie on one of the two lines
EF, GH which are par 1 to AB on either side of it and at a
distance of 3 cm. from it. (See p. 90. Ex. 2.)
Similarly all pts. 4 cm. distant from CD lie on either PQ or
RS which are par 1 to CD and 4 cm. from it on either
side.
The 4 intersections of EF, GH with PQ, RS give 4 solutions.
7. Let two perp. st. lines OX, OY represent the rulers ; let AB
be any position of the moving rod, and C the mid-pt. of
AB.
From Prob. 10. we see that the line joining the vertex of a
rt. angled A to the mid-pt. of the hypotenuse = half the
hypotenuse.
.'. OC = |AB = a constant.
.'. C always lies on a circle with the fixed point O as centre,
and radius equal to this constant.
It is obvious that C always lies within Z.XOY. .’. its locus is
that quadrant of this circle which lies within L XOY.


8. Let ACB be a rt. angled AonAB as hypotenuse. Then, if AB
is bisected at D, CD is constant, being equal to half of AB.
[Ex. 10, p. 47.]
Thus the locus of C is a circle whose centre is D and radius
equal to half the given base.
9. Take several positions of X along BC. Bisecting each of the
lines AX so obtained we conjecture from the figure that
the required locus is a st. line par 1 to BC.
Draw AD perp, to BC and bisect it at O. Let Xbe any point
on BC, and P the mid-pt. of AX.
Then, by Ex. 2, p. 64, OP is par 1 to DX, i.e. to BC-
Similarly any other position of the pt. P lies on the st. line
through O par 1 to BC, which is therefore the required locus.
10. Let Obe the centre of the given O, C the mid-pt. of AO.
Take X any pt. on the circle, and P the mid-pt. of AX.
Then, by Ex. 3, p. 64, CP=£OX=a constant, for OX is the
radius of the given ©. Thus P is always a constant
distance from the fixed pt. C, and its locus is .'. a circle
with centre C and radius equal to half the radius of
the given circle.
11. Bisect AB in C, and AX in D. Then DC is par 1 to BX. [Ex. 2,
p. 64] and is .'. perp. to AD. Thus the locus required is
that of the vertices of the rt. angled A* which can be
drawn on AC as hypotenuse. Now use Ex. 8*
12. To find a position of P, measure off along OX a length OM leas
than 6 cm. At M draw MP perp. to OX and equal to
the difference between 6 cm. and OM. Then
PM + PN = PM + OM = 6 cm.
(i) Along OX cut off OA=6 cm. Join PA. Then MP=MA;
.•. MPA=z_ MAP=45°, for L PMA=9O°. Thus A being a
fixed pt., and l OAP a constant L , the line AP is known in
position, and .'. the locus of P is a line through A such that
L. OAP=45°. This line makes equal intercepts, viz. 6 cm.,
on OX and OY.
(ii) Let Pbe a pt. such that PM -PN=3 cm. Along OY cut
off OB = 3 cm. Then, since ON NP=3 cm., we have
NP=NB; whence L YBP=4S°. Thus the locus of P is
a st. line through B, such that z.YBP=4S°.
13. (i) From OX cut off any length OM. From M draw MP perp.
to XO and equal to 20M. Then P is a position of the
moving pt.; for PM=2OM=2PN. By plotting several


positions we see that the locus is a st. line through O.
Similarly for (ii).
14. The pt, must lie on the st. line EF which is par 1 to the two
given par 1 lines and half way between them. It must also
lie on the O whose centre is the given pt. O and whose
radius is the given length a. The intersections of EF and
this circle give possible positions of the pt.
There will be two, one, or no solutions according as a is greater
than, equal to, or less than, the perp. from O on EF.
15. All pts. 2|" distant from MX lie on one or other of the two
lines, par 1 to MX, on either side of it, and 2|" distant from
it.
All pts. 2|" distant from S lie on a circle, centre S and radius!
2|". It will be found that only the line on the same side
of MX as S cuts the © ; the two intersections of this line
with the © give the required pts.
16. Assume the distance of S from MX to be 2". Draw a series of
lines all par 1 to MX, on the same side of it as S, and dis-
tant from it 1", T 2", T 4", Also with centre S and
radii equal to these distances describe arcs and mark the
pts. where each arc cuts the corresponding line. These
pts. are all equidistant from S and MX.
The curve formed by joining these pts. is called a parabola.
17. Let AB»be the given base, h the given altitude, XY the given
st. line.
The perp. distance of vertex C from AB is h. C must lie
on one of the two lines par 1 to AB and. at a distance h from
it on either side. It must also lie on XY. the inter-
sections of the two parallels with XY give two positions
of C; and there are two A 8 which satisfy the given con-
ditions.
18. Let ABC be given A. Bisect the ÜB,C by 81, Cl meeting in
I. Then all pts. equidistant from BA, BC lie on 81,
[Prob. 15.] ; and all pts. equidistant from CA, CB lie bn Cl.
Thus I is equidistant from each of the sides.
19. (i) Let Pbe the mid-pt. of QR. Draw PM, PN perp. to OX,
OY respectively. Then PM=|OR, and PN=4OQ.
[Ex. 3, p. 64.]
.-. PM + PN=i[Oß + OQ] = constant. [Hypi\
locus of P is a st. line cutting off from OX, OY intercepts
equal to this constant. [See Ex. 12.] Similarly for (ii).


20. (i) From S draw SQ in any direction, making SQ 3'5" in
length. Join S'Q.
From S' draw S'P, making z_QS'P equal to L S'QS, on same
side of QB', and cutting SQ at P.
Then PS'=PQ [Th. s], So that
SP + PS'=SP + PQ=SQ =3-5".
Thus any number of points such as P may be found on the
required locus, which is known as an ellipse.
(ii) From S draw SQ, T 5" in length, in any direction. Join
S'Q.
From S' draw S'P, cutting SQ produced at P, and making
l QS'P equal to l S'QP.
Then P is a point on the required locus, which is known as a
hyperbola.
The proof follows the method of (i).
Page 98.
1. Through A draw PAQ par 1 to BC. At A draw AB, AC making
angles PAB, QAC each =X. Then, by Theor. 14, each of
the lines AB, AC makes the required angle with BC.
2. Draw any line par 1 to OA ; and also a second line par 1 to OB
and the same distance from it as the first line is from OA.
The intersections of these lines give a pt. P equidistant
from OA, 08.
Similarly find another pt. Q equidistant from OA, 08, Then
PQ is the bisector of /.AOB. [Proh. 15.]
3. Produce OP to S so that PS=PO. Through S draw SQ
par 1 to OB to meet OA in Q, and SR par 1 to OA to
meet OB in R.
Then OQSR is a par m . QR, OS bisect each other.
[Th. 21. Cor. 3.]
.‘. QR passes through P, and is bisected at that pt.
4. Take anjr pt. Pin 08. Through P draw PQ par 1 to OC and
meeting OA in Q. Draw PR par 1 to OA meeting OC in R.
Then OQPR is a par m . its diagonals bisect each other
[Th. 21. Cor. 3]. i.e. QR is bisected by 08.
Since P may be taken anywhere on OB the number of
solutions is unlimited.


5. Let PQ, RS be the two par Is . Take any pt. Bin PQ; with
centre B, and radius equal to the given length, draw'a
© cutting RS in C, D. Through A draw par 11 to BC, BD.
Then the part intercepted on each of these is equal to the
given length, since the opp. sides of a par m are equal.
There are two, one, or no solutions according as the circle
of construction cuts, touches, or does not meet RS;
i.e. according as the given length is greater than, equal to,
or less than the perp. distance between the two parallels.
6. Bisect z. BAG by AO meeting BC in O. Through O draw OE
par 1 to AC to meet AB in E, and CD par 1 to AB to meet
AC in D. Then AEOD is a par m by construction.
Also l EOA=Z.OAD [ Th. 14.] =
.'. EO = EA. .'. ADOE is a rhombus. [Th. 21.]
7. Let ABC be an equilat. A ; bisect the angles at B and Cby
80, CO ; through O draw OD, OE par 1 to AB and AC
respectively meeting BC in D and E. Then, by Theors. 14,
16, A ODE is equiangular to A ABC, so that ODE is
equilat. Again l DOB=alt. z_ABO=z.OBD ;
OD=BD. Similarly OE = EC.
/. BD =DE = EC.
8. (i) Through the given pts. P, Q, R draw BPC, CQA, ARB
par 1 to QR, RP, PQ respectively. Then from the par" 01
RQPB, RQCP, we have BP= RQ=PC. [Th. 21.]
Thus Pis the mid-pt. of BC. Similarly for Q, R.
(ii) Construct a A ABE such that AB, BE are equal to the
lengths of the given sides and AE is double the length of
given median.
Complete the par™ ABEC. Let BC, AE meet in D.
Then AC= BE, and AD=|AE. [Th. 21. Cm. 3.]
ABC is the required A .
(iii) See Fig. to 111. p. 97.
Let BC be the given side. Take two-thirds of each of the
given medians ; hence construct a A BOC.
Complete par m BOCK and produce KO to Aso that OA=OK.
Then, by Ex. 1, p. 64, OY and OZ bisect AC and AB ; and the
rest of the proof follows as in 111.
(iv) See Fig. to 111. p. 97.
Take two-thirds of each of the medians and construct the
A KOC. Complete the par m KCOB and proceed as in (iii).


PART II.
Page 101.
1. (i) Draw a line AB to represent 1 yard. On AB describe a
square ABCD. Divide AB, AD each into 3 equal parts, and
through the pts. of division of each line draw parallels to
the other line. Then the square is now divided into
compartments each of which represents 1 square foot.
There are 3 rows each containing 3 squares ; the
square representing 1 square yard contains 3x3 or 3 2
squares representing square feet.
(ii) and (iii) are done similarly.
4. Consider a square in the plan each of whose sides is one inch.
The area represented is (5 x 5) sq. mi.
Hence 1 sq. in. represents 25 sq. miles.
.'. 6 sq. in. represent 150 sq. miles.
Page 102.
The majority of Examples 1-10 are too simple for solution.
A few are given as specimens.
3. By the extension of Theor. 23 given on p. 101,
the area = (0 - 8 x 3'5) sq. in. = 2'B sq. in.
On drawing the figure on squared paper ruled to tenths of an
inch it will be found that there are 8 rows each containing
35 small squares. Thus the number of squares is 280.
But the area of each small square is one-hundredth of a
sq. inch. Hence the area is 280 hundredths of a sq. inch,
i.e. 2'B sq. in.
6. The area = (l - 6x2T )sq. in.=3 - 36sq. in.
By drawing a figure, it will be seen that the number of squares
each equal to ,-Lj of a square inch is 16x21, i.e. 336.
Thus the area = 336 hundredths of a sq. inch or 3'36 sq. in.
8. Here a= 7 ft., 6=6 ft.; .'. area =(7x 6) sq. ft.
9. a = 2500 metres, 6= 4 metres; .•. area = (2500 x 4) sq. m.

10. a=J(l76ox3) ft., ft;

. . area = —-—r sq. ft. = 110 sq. ft.

11. Since the area of a rectangle=(length)*, (breadth), we have
breadth {area)
Thus the breadth = = 5 cm.
12. As in Ex. 11, length = (area) + (breadth).
Thus' the length=p|=2 - 6".
13. (i)
In the Figure, ABCD represents the original rectangle, AQRD
the rect. obtained by trebling the length AB. It will be
seen that the new rectangle is 3 times the area of the
original rectangle.
(ii) ABCD represents the original
rectangle, AQZY the new rect-
angle obtained by trebling
AB and AD. It will be seen
that the new rectangle is 9
times the area of ABCD.
The general rule is:
Each time we multiply either
the length or the breadth of
a rectangle by any factor, the area must also be multi-
plied by that factor.
14. The length and breadth of the garden are’36 yds. and 25 yds.
respectively. .'. its area = (36x25) sq. yds. = 900 sq. yds.
The new area is 1200 sq. yds.,
.’. new length = I |§ fl =4B yds.
Since 10 yds. are represented by 1 inch, . . the length on
the plan = 4 - 8".
15. The actual length and breadth are
(6 - 5 x 20) metres and (4'5 x 20) metres ; i.e. 130 m. and 90 m.
lienee area = (130 x 90) sq. m.


16. The area of the plan = 3'2 x 4’5 = 14 - 4 sq. era.
14 - 4 sq. cm. represent 1440 sq. yds.
1 sq. cm. represents 100 sq. yds.
1 cm. 10 yds.
Thus the scale is 10 yds. to the centimetre.
17. Actual length = 3'25 x 100 = 325 ft.
actual breadth =l6O ft.
/. breadth on plan =}JJ g = I'6".
18. It will be noticed that the small rectangle on the right of the
figure, whose dimensions are 10 ft. by 5 ft., can be fitted
exactly into the cavity in the upper portion of the figure.
Thus the area is equal to that of a rectangle whose length
is 30 ft. and breadth 20 ft., and is .'. (30x20) sq. ft.
‘ i.e. 600 sq. ft.
19. From the right hand upper corner of the figure cut off the
rectangle whose length is 24 ft. and breadth 12 ft. This
can be fitted exactly into the hollow portion of the remain-
ing figure to make up a rectangle whose dimensions are
24 ft. by 48 ft. Thus the area of original figure
= (24 x 48) sq. ft. = 1152 sq. ft.
20. It will be seen that the dimensions of the unshaded rectangle
'in the centre are obtained by subtracting twice the width
of the border from those of the whole rectangle.
Thus the inner rectangle has length = 10 ft., and breadth =5 ft.,
and its area is 50 sq. ft.
But area of whole rectangle=(lo x 15) sq. ft., or 150 sq. ft.
Thus area of shaded portion = 150- 50, or 100 sq. ft.
21. To obtain the dimensions of the outer rectangle add twice
the width of the border to those of the ipner rectangle.
We thus get its length = 15 ft., and breadth = 12'5 ft.
area of outer rectangle = (15 x 12 - 5) sq. ft. = 187'5 sq. ft.
Also area of inner rectangle =(7 x 4 -5) sq. ft. =3l‘6 sq. ft.
area of border = (187'5-31’5) sq. ft. = 156 sq. ft.
22. Each of the rectangles at the four corners has its length
= J(l5-5) ft. = 5 ft., and breadth = -|(]2-5) ft. = 3'5 ft.
sum of their areas = 4(5 x 3-5) sq. ft. = 70 sq. ft.
But area of whole rectangle =(l5 x 12) sq. ft. = 180 sq. ft.
area of shaded portion = (180-70) sq. ft. = 110 sq. ft.


23. Consider the dimensions of the four shaded figures at the
corners of the original rectangle.
Their length —£(3o —18) ft. = 6 ft., breadth = £(2O - B)ft. = G ft.
.'. sum of their areas = 4(6 x 6) sq. ft. = 144 sq. ft.
also area of central rectangle = (18 x 6) sq. ft. = 144 sq. ft.
.'. total shaded area = (144 +144) sq. ft. = 288 sq. ft.
24. Consider the four small squares into which the original
square is divided by the dotted lines. Each is divided
into two equal portions one shaded and one plain. Thus
by addition the whole area of the shaded portion
= A (area of whole sqnare) = 72 sq. ft.
25. As in Ex. 24, whole shaded area = £ whole rectangle
=£(10 x 15) sq. ft. = 75 sq. ft.
Page 105.
1. (i) Area=(s-5x4) sq. cm. = 22'0 sq. cm.
(ii) Area = (2-4 x T 5) sq. in.= 3'6 sq. in.
2. Apply Prob. 12. Draw DK, BIVI perp. to AB, AD respectively.
By measurement DK = 1'36", .’. Area = 2'5 x P 36 = 3'400 sq. in.
This is only approximate since the length obtained by
measurement is only correct to the nearest hundredth
of an inch, and in finding the area any error in the
measurement of one line is multiplied by the number of
units in the other line. Thus in the above DK may be
any length greater than 1 '355" and less than P 365", and in
taking its length as P 36" we must expect an error not
exceeding 0'005"; and there is a consequent error in the
area not greater than (2'5 x 0'005) sq. in. or 00125 sq. in.
By measurement, BM=2'27".
.•. area = AD. BM=(l'sx2'27) sq. in. = 3 - 405 sq. in.
Thus average of the two results = £(3'400 + 3'405) sq. in.
= 3‘4025 sq. in.
3. By Prob. 12, draw a par" 1 having sides 6 cm., 5 cm. and
included angle = 50°.
By measurement, the perp. distance between the two long
sides is 3 - 82 cm., representing 19T metres.
Thus area=(l9'l x3O) sq. m. = 573 sq. ra. (approx.).


Again, by measurement, perp. distance between the two
short sides is 4'6 cm., representing 23 metres.
Thus area = 23 x 25 = 575 sq. m. (approx.).
Hence the average result is 574 0 sq. m.
4. Altitude of par m = = 1 - 5".
Draw AB = 2'B" and a line parallel to it at a distance of T 6".
With centre A, radius = 2", draw an arc cutting this line
in D. Then complete the par m as in Prob. 12.
5. Altitude =— = P 93".
Draw two parallel lines 1‘93" apart. Take a pt. A in one
line as centre, and, with radius = 2", cut the lines in B,
D respectively. Cut off DC on the second line = 3".
Then ABCD is the rhombus.
By measurement each of the acute angles=7s°.

3. If we consider BC as the base the altitude of the Ais seen to
be AC, for ACB is a rt. angle.

When a= 6 cm., 6 = 5 cm., area=£(6xs) sq. cm. = 15 sq. cm.
Draw CK perp. to AB. By measurement
AB = 7'B cm., CK = 3'B cm. (each to the nearest mm.).

(ii) The A 8 are on the same base XY and between the same
par 1 ’ XY and BC. Now use Theor. 26.
(iii) Add the A AXY to each of the equal A 8 BXY, CXY.
(iv) Take the A XKY from each of the equal A 8 BXY, CXY.
2. The two A 8 are on equal bases and of the same altitude ;
hence, by Theor. 26, they are of equal area.
Divide the base into 3 equal parts by Prob. 7 and join the
pts. of section to the vertex. The three A’ so'formed have
equal bases and a common altitude.
3. In the Fig. of Theor. 21. Cor. 3, the A ADD = A DOC, being on
equal oases AO, OC, and having a common altitude.
Similarly A DOC= A COB= A BOA.
4. The A ABX = A ACX ; and A YBX = A YCX. (Tk. 26.]
Hence, by subtraction, A ABY = A ACY.

1. Draw a A whose sides are 3'7", 2 0", I‘9". Taking 2'o" as base,
the altitude by measurement is 1 - 14".
Hence area of plan = - 0x IT4) sq. in.
But 1 sq. inch represents 100 2 sq. yds.
.'. area of enclosure = J(2'o x 1'14) x 100 2 sq. yds;
= 11400 sq. yds.
2. Draw two lines 6'2 cm. and 7'2 cm. respectively inclined at
angle of 45°. Completing the A and taking 7'2 cm. as
base, the altitude by measurement is 4'4 cm. (to nearest
mm.).
Hence area of plan = £(7 - 2 x 4 - 4) sq. cm. (approx.).
But 1 sq. cm. represents 20 2 or 400 sq. m.
area of enclosure=J (7'2 x 4'4) x 400 sq. m.
= 6336 sq. m. (approx.).


3. Since base X altitude = 2 (area of triangle) ; [Th. 25.]
, . , 2 x6'6
.. altitude =— — = 2'4 cm.

Thus the locus of A is one of the two st. lines par 1 to BC and
at a distance of 2'4 cm. on each side of it.
With centre B, radius = 2'6 cm., draw an arc cutting one of
these lines in A. Join CA. By measurement CA =ST cm.

Hence the locus of A is one of the two st. lines par 1 to BC and
at a distance 2-04" from it.
At C draw CA making = 68° and cutting one of these
lines in A. Join AC.
By measurement, AC = 2'20".
5i For a graphical representation of the result see p. 321.
6. Since the equal sides contain supplementary angles the two
A 3 can be placed having one side in common and the
other two equal sides in same st. line. Thus we have two
A 3 of same altitude on equal bases.
Let the A 3 be ACB, ACD with the side AC common and the
sides BC, CD in the same st. line.
If the A 3 are congruent, L ACD is equal to one of the z. 3 of
the A ABC; and it can be seen by Theor. 8 that this is
only possible when z_ACB = z.ACD, that is, when the two
supplementary angles are rt. l s .
7. Bisect the base BC of the A ABC at D, and draw DK at
rt. U to BC and meeting the par 1 to BC through A in

Theor. 26 it is equal in area to A ABC.
8. Let P, Q, R, Sbe the mid-pts. of AB, BC, CD, DA. Let PQ,

Take away from each the A XQC.


10. Let'C and D be vertices of two equal A'ACB, ADB on
opposite sides of the common base AB ; let CD meet AB
or AB produced in E. Then if DF, CG are drawn perp. to
AB, we have DF = CG, [Of. Th. 27.] and the A"DEF, CEG
are identically equal. [Th. 17.]

3. x=s m., p = 12m.
4. x=6 cm., p = B’B cm.
5. Here draw BD perp. to CA and meeting it produced in D.
Denoting AD by x and BD by p, and-taking the A‘ADB, CDB,
we find x=s ft., p —l2 ft.
6. As in 1-4, we have x=l6 m., p=l2 m.
7. With the figure of text we have BD -x , DC =a —x.
Now AB 2 BD 2 =p 2 = AC 2 -CD 2 [Th. 29.]
c l -x 2 = h <l (a-x'f,
c 2 x 2 =b 2 —a 2 -,r 2 + 2a.r ;

Also p 2 = AB 2 - BD 2 =c 2 -

2. Use Prob. 8 to construct first AADB and then A DBC.
Through C draw CX par 1 to DB meeting AB produced in
X. Join DX. Then ADX is the req d A.
By measurement, perp. from X on AD = 4'67" (approx.).
.'. area of quad‘ = J(4'67 x 3 - 6) sq. in. = 8'406 sq. in.
3. At A, B draw AE, BC each equal to AB, making the l‘ BAE,
ABC each=loB°. \
With centres E, C and radii equal to AB draw arcs cutting
in D. Then ABCDE is equilateral.
Use the Fig. and construction of Prob. 18, Cor. By measure-
ment we have XY = B'9 cm., perp. from D on XY =6’2 cm.
.'. area=£(6'2x B'9) sq. cm. = 27'59 sq. cm. (approx.).
4. Draw the Fig. on the req d scale by two applications of Prob. 8.
. >lf CX drawn par 1 to DB meets AB produced in X, we shall
find by measurement that perp. from XonAD = 13 - 3 cm.
(to the nearest mm.).
area of plan=|(7 - 8 x 13 - 3) sq. cm. = 5P87 sq. cm. (approx.).
But 1 sq. cm. represents (50) 2 sq. m.
area of field = 51 - 87 x 2500 = 129675 sq. m. (approx.).
5. Join AD. . Through C draw CE par 1 to AD to meet BA (or
BA produced) in E. Then, as in Prob, 18,
A EBD— A ABC.


6. Let CAB be the given A on base AB. Through A dra'ft- AD
perp. to AB and equal to the given altitude, and through
C draw CE par 1 to AB meeting AD in E. Join DB, and
draw EF par to DB meeting AB in F. Join DF, EB.
Then A DAF = A EAB = A CAB. [Proh. 18.]
7. Join BX. Through A draw AD par 1 to BC meeting BX in
D. Then ACDB=AABC. Join XC. Draw DF par 1 to
XC to meet BC in F, and join XF.
AXBF= A DBC [Proh. 18] = AABC.
8. Through C and D draw CE, DF par 1 to BX and AX respectively
meeting AB produced in E and F ; then EXF is the req d A.
9. Divide the base into n equal parts [Prob. 7], and join the pts.
of division to the vertex.
12. As the method is quite general, it will be sufficient to take a
particular case. Let ABC be a triangle from which it is
required to cut off a fifth part by a st. line through a pt. X
in AB. Take BD a fifth part of BC [Prob. 7]. Join AD,
and through X draw XE to meet BC in E, so that
AXBE = AABD [Ex. 5.].
14. With the construction of Prob. 18, make the A DAX equal to
the given quadrilateral. Take AY equal to one-fifth of AX;
join DY. Then A DAY=one fifth of A DAX, that is, of the
quadrilateral. The method is quite general.
Page 134.
3. Let Pf/I, QN be the ordinates of P (4, 3) and Q (12, 7).
Let R be the mid-pt. of PQ, and RL its ordinate.
Then RL=|(PM 4-QN). [Ex. 9, p. 65.]
Again OL-OM =ML= LN [Th. 22] = ON-OL ;
whence OL=J(OM + ON).
5. Draw ordinates from (0, 6), (0, 12) to meet the line joining
O to P (18, 15).
Then OP is trisected by these ordinates, and the ordinates
are respectively 5 and 10 units. [Th. 22. Cor.]
Thus the req d coords, are (6, 5), (12, 10).
7. If P (x, y) represents any one of the points, we have clearly
OP 2 =x 2 +,y 2 . [Th. 29.]


8. See Ex. 1, p. 133.
9. If P, Q, R represent the pts. in the order given, it will be
found, as on p. 133, (Example 1) that PQ 2 =PR 2 . Thus
the pts. form an isosceles A whose vertex is P.
10. If P represents anyone of the pts., it will be found in each case
(by the method of Ex. 7) that OP 2 =25.
11. On plotting the points it will be found that in each case the
distance is the hypotenuse of a rt.-angled A whose sides
are a and h.
12. The lines are the diagonals of a square.
13. If P, Q, R are the points in the order given, it will be found
that PQ =QR = 13.
Let QR meet the .r-axis in S ; then, by congruent A B , PR and
OS bisect each other. [ Th. 17.]
14. The fourth vertex is obviously at O ; and since the diagonals
bisect each other, the coords, of their intersection are those
of the mid-pt. of the line joining (0, 0) and (14, 10). See
Ex. 3.
15. As in the Ex. on p. 133, it may be shewn that the length of
each side is 13. The intersection of the diagonals is the
mid-pt. of the line joining (0, 0) and (18, 12). See Ex. 3.
16. The locus is the perpendicular bisector of the distance between
the two points \Prob. 14], and cuts the axes at the pts.
(4, 0), (0, -4).
18. Each side is clearly equal to «/2 inches, (Ex. 13, p. 124) and
the figure is a square whose area is 2 sq. in. The second
figure is a square on a side of 1".
19. It will be found that each triangle has a base of 14 units
(lying on the .r-axis) and height 10 units. Hence the
area is i(10 x 14), or 70, units of area.
20. To facilitate measurement it will be found convenient to take
half an inch as the unit. Take the origin as vertex.
In (i) base = 6 units, height = 3 units.
.". area =J(3x 6) = 9 units of area.


21. To find the area, choose that side of the A which is par 1 to
an axis as base, and measure the altitude along the other
axis.
22. These A 8 are rt. angled. Take the two sides which are par 1
to the axes as base and altitude respectively.
23. If A, B, C, D are the points, the lengths of AB, BC can be found
as in Ex. 1, p. 133. To find the area, draw parallels to the
#-axis through B and D, and parallels to the y-axis through
A and C. The area of the surrounding rectangle thus
formed is 9x15, or 135, units of area. The areas of the
corner A" thus formed are easily found to be 30, 30, 6, 6
units of area respectively. Hence the area of ABCD is
135 - 72, or 63, units of area.
24. See Theorem 28.
25. Follow the method of the example worked out on p. 134.
26. See solution of Ex. 23. In this case the area is easily seen to
be twice that of a triangle whose base is 23 and altitude 5.
27. Let P, Q, R, S be the points in the order given; then by
Theor. 29,
PQ= s/P+liP =l3 ; RQ =VsHb 2 =lO,
SR = v'l2 2 + 9 2 =15.
By measurement (or calculation) SP=B - 24.
Let SR meet OY in T, and let RM be the ordinate of R.
Then area of fig. OTRQ=trap m OTRM + A RMQ
[7%. 28.]
= 18 + 24 = 42 units of area.
And area of A OPQ=|OP. OQ=J xsx 12
=3O units of area.
28. Here BC = 9 obviously, and as in Ex. 1, p. 133 we easily find
that AB = 10, CD = 17. AD = 12 - 7 by measurement.
Let CB and DA produced meet in E. The coords, of A shew
that DA bisects the angle between the axes; hence it
easily follows that Eis the point ( -10, -10).
Area of ABCD = A ECD - A ABE
= 130 - 5 units of area.


29. If P, Q, R, S, O are the given points, the sides can all be found
as in Ex. 1, p. 133.
If SQ meets OY in T the req d area is the sum of the areas of
the A 8 PTQ, QSR, STP.
30. Through A draw a par 1 to OX meeting the ordinates from B
and C in D, E respectively.
Then A ABC = trap m ECBD - A AEG - A ADB
=4(8x8)-i(lx4)-J(4x7)
= 16 units of area.
And each unit represents 100 x 100 sq. yds.;
.'. area of field = 160,000 sq. yds.
Again, BC=V8 2 +6 2 =lO units.
.'. corresponding side of field =lO x 100 yds.
Let p be the perp. from A on BC, then
|.px BC=l6x IOOx 100,
whence p — 320 yds.
31 Each side of the figure is the hypotenuse of a right-angled A
whose sides are 6, 14. Hence each side = */6 2 +14 2 = 15'23.
(i) The circumscribing square contains 20 2 units of area; from
this we must subtract four rt.-angled A 8 each of which
contains J(6 x 14), or 42, units of area. Thus the given
square contains 400 4 x 42, or 232, units of area.
(ii) By the method of page 120, we find that the given square
consists of four equal rt.-angled A’, each of which contains
42 units of area, together with a central square on a side
of 8 units.
.'. the square contains 168+64, or 232 units of area.
Page 138.
1. Of AB, AC let AB be the greater. Produce AX to E making
XE=AX. Join EB. Then by Theor. 4, the A B AXC, BXE
are congruent; and .'. EB=AC, and L. BEX =z. CAX.
Also from A ABE, since AB > BE,
L BEX >z. BAX,, i.e. L CAX > L BAX.


From this it easily follows that l CAX > L CAP, and AP lies
within angle CAX.
Again U CAD, BAD are complements of z_ s ACD, ABD respec-
tively, and L ACD > L ABD. .'. L CAD is less than L BAD ;
from which we have Z.CAD is less than u CAP, and AP
lies without angle CAD.
Thus AP is intermediate in position between AD, AX.
.'., by Ex. 8, p.' 55, it is also intermediate in magnitude.
2. Let ABC be the given A, AB being greater than AC, and AH
the bisector of the vertical /.BAG. Draw CLK perp. to
AH, cutting AH in L, and AB in K.
Then by Theor. 17 the A B ALK, ALC are congruent, and
/. Z.AKL=/-ACL. '
(i) Now z_AKC=sum of A KBC, KCB. \Th. 16.]
To each add Z.ACK :
then twice z. ACK = sum of A ABC, ACB ;
z.ACK=half sum of Z- S ABC, ACB.
(ii) As before, L ACK=sum of U KBC, KCB.
To each of these add L KCB :
then Z.ACB=Z.KBC + twice/.KCB.
.'. twice z. KCB=difference of z. 8 ACB, KBC;
that is, L KCB=half difference of U ACB, ABC.
3. This follows at once from Ex. 2 (ii) and Ex. 8, p. 43.
4. Let the given diff. be equal to AB and the hypotenuse equal
to K. From A draw AE making with BA produced an L
equal to half a rt. L. From centre B, with radius equal
to K, describe a circle cutting AE or AE produced in the
points C, C'. From C and C' draw perps. CD, C'D' to AB ;
and join CB, C'B. Then either of the A’CDB, C'D'B will
satisfy the given conditions.
Note. If the given hypotenuse Kbe greater than the perpen-
dicular drawn from B to AE, there will be two solutions.
If the line K be equal to this perpendicular, there wilt
be one solution ; but if less, the problem is impossible.


5. (i) Let AB be the given base, X the difference of the L? at the
base, and K the difference of the remaining sides.
Draw BE, making the L ABE equal to half the l'X. See Ex. 2.
From centre A, with radius equal to K, describe a circle
cutting BE in D and D'. Let D be the point of inter-
section nearer to B.
Join AD and produce it to C.
Draw BC, making l DBC equal to l BDC.
Then CAB is the A required.
Note. This problem is possible only when the given
difference K is greater than the perpendicular drawn from
A to BE.
(ii) Let AB be the given base, K the sum of the remaining
sides, and X the difference of the U at the base. Make
the Z.ABD equal to half the LX ; draw BE pern, to BD,
and from centre A and with radius equal to K describe a
circle cutting BE in E. Join AE, and at B make Z.EBC
equal to Z.AEB. Then ACB is the required A, [Ex. 2,]
since, if AE meets BD at F, it may be shewn that CB = CF.
6. Let AB be the given base, and K the sum of one side and
the perp. from the vertex to the base.
Bisect AB at X : draw XH perp. to AB and equal to K.
Join AH : at A draw AC making aHAC=z.AHX and cutting
XH in C.
Then ACB is the A required ; for CH=CA.
7. See Ex. 8, p. 123.
8. (i) If Ois without the L DAB and its opp. vert. L, then OA is
without the par™ ABCD : therefore the perp. drawn from
C to OA is equal to the sum of the perp" drawn from B
and Dto OA. [See Ex. 13, p. 65.]
Now the A 8 OAC, OAD, CAB are upon the same base OA;
and the altitude of the A OAC with respect to this base
=the sum of the altitudes of the A 8 OAD, OAB.
.‘. the A OAC=the sum of the A" OAD, OAB.
(ii) Let BX, DY, CZ be the perp 8 on AO. Then drawing CH
perp. to BX we may shew, by Theor. 17, that A'ADY,
CBH are congruent, and .'. BH = DY. Hence
CZ = BX DY.
Now proceed as in (i).


9. In the quad l ABCD, draw BO par 1 to the diag. AC, and CO
par 1 to AB ; then DBO is the required A, and ABOC is a
par”. Also the perp. from Don BO is equal to the sum
of the perp 3 from D on AC and from B on AC.
A DBO = A DAC + A ABC,
since these A 3 have equal bases.
10. Let BC be the given base and ABC the A in any of its
positions. Then since the area of the Ais constant and
the base is known the length of the altitude is also
constant. Let O be the intersection of the medians;
then as in Ex. 4, p. 109 it is easy to prove
A BOC= A COA= A AOB ;
.-. ABOC = one-third of A BAC=constant.
Now these A 3 have same base, hence the altitude of A BOC
is one third of the altitude of A BAC and is constant.
Hence the locus of O is a st. line par 1 to BC and at a
fixed distance from it.
11. Let ABC be the given Aon base BC, and DE the given st.
line. Through A draw AF par 1 to BC meeting DE in F,
and join FB, FC. Then FBC is the required A [ Th . 26].
If ED is par 1 to BC, the solution is only possible when DE
passes through A. In this case any pt. in DE may ,be
taken as the vertex of the required A, and the number
of solutions is unlimited.
12. Let E, F be the mid-pts. of AB, CD. Then, by Theor. 20,
EF =BC and is constant ; and E is a fixed point. Hence
the locus of F is a semicircle, with centre E and radius BC.




PART III.
Page 145.
1. ByTheor. 29, OB 2 =OD 2 +DB 2 . .'. = 5010.
2. With the Fig. of Theor. 31, OD the perp. from Oon AB bisects
it and /. AB = 2DB.
But DB=VOB 2 -OD 2 = \/i32^5 2 = 12". AB = 24".
3. Let AB represent the chord l - 6" long, and OD the perp. from
the centre, then D is the mid-pt. of AB, and BD = 0‘8".
Now OD 2 =OB 2 -BD 2 . .'. OD = JT-WA =n/ct36 = o'6''.
Similarly for the chord T 2" long.
4. Here OB=4 cm., BD = 3 cm.
OD=VOB 2 BD 2 =s/7 cm.=2 - 6 cm. (to the nearest mm.).
5. Here BD = 35", 08=37". .-. OD = n/3~7 2 - 35 2 =l2''= 1 ft.
6. Here BD = T 2", 0B=1'3" ; and OD = VoB 2 -BD‘- = 0-5".
.". area of A AB xOD =|(2'4 x o's) sq. in. =o'6 sq. in.
7. With centres P and Q, radii l - 7", describe © 8 cutting in 0.
Then Ois the centre of the req d O.
Draw OX perp. to PQ then, by Theor. 31, X is middle pt. of
PQ.
Thus OX 2 =OP 2 - PX 2 . .-. OX=VI -7 2 -1 -5 2 = =O-8".
Page 147.
1. Let O be the common centre, ABCD the st. line cutting the
inner Oinß, C, and the outer OinA, D. Draw OX perp.
to ABCD. Then BX = CX, and AX = DX. [TL 31.]
.'. difference AB = difference CD.
2. By Theor. 31, the l‘ AWIC, BMC are both rt. L‘.
by Theor. 2, AMB is a st. line.
AB is the line of centres, and CD the common chord of the
two ©’ ; and we have proved that AB is perp. to CD and
passes through its middle pt.


3. Let the bisector of l BAC cut BC in D. Then in A' ADB, ADC,
it follows that DB = DC and z.ADB = z_ADC. [Th. 4.]
That is, AD bisects BC at rt. L‘, and passes through the centre.
4. The required locus is the st. line bisecting at rt. L' the st. line
joining the two given pts. [See Prob. 14, p. 91.]
5. Let A, Bbe the two given points, and PQ the given st. line.
Join AB, and bisect it at rt. angles by a st. line which
meets PQ at O. Then Ois the centre of the required 0.
[See Ex. 4.] Impossible when PQ is at rt. angles to AB
or AB produced.
6. Let A, Bbe the given points, and R the given radius. With
centres A and B, and radii equal to R describe ©• cutting
at O. Then Ois the centre of the required ©.
Impossible when the given radius is less than half AB.
Page 149.
1. Bisect AB, BC at rt. Üby DO, EC respectively. Then O is
the centre of the req d O [Th. 32]. By construction,
OEBD is a rect.; and .'. CE =BD = 0'8", and EB = T 5".
Also OB=\/OE 2 + EB 2 =V(O-8) 2 +(1 -5) 2 = = 1-7".
2. Draw AB = 6 cm. From D the mid-pt. of AB draw DO perp.
to AB and equal to 3 cm. Then a © with centre O
radius OA is the © req d . Also OA 2 = OD 2 +DA 2 .
Whence OA = 3V2 cm. = 4‘2 cm. (to the nearest mm.).
3. Let AB be the diameter, O the centre, CD a chord of given
length. Bisect CD at E ; then Z.OED = 90°.
.-. OE 2 =OD 2 -ED 2 =16 —4=l2 ;
whence OE=VI2 = 2V , 3, or 3'46 cm. (nearly).
4. With the notation of the Fig. of 111. p. 143 we have
OP=26", PR = 24", PC'=2s".
.-. OR 2 =OP 2 PR 2 , whence OR = 10".
Also RO' 2 =PO' 2 -PR 2 , whence RO'=7".
Thus oV=CR + RO'=l7".
5. Let AB, CD be the longer and shorter chords respectively,
E, F their mid-pts. and O the centre. Then OE being
perp. to AB [Th. 31], and .‘. also to the par 1 line CD [Th. 14],
must pass through F [Th. 31]. Hence EOF is a st. line.


Now OE 2 =OA 2 —AE 2 ; whence OE=2-5". Similarly OF=6O".
EF, which is the sum or difference of OE, OF, according as
the chords are on opposite sides or the same side of O, is
either 8 - 5" or 3 - 5".
6. As in the last Ex., let OE=.r cm., and OF=(#+l) cm.
Now OE 2 + E A 2 =(radius) 2 =O F 2 + FC 2 .
.'. x 2 + l6 = (radius) 2 =(r + l) 2 +9 ;
whence x= Z. Thus O A=Vs 2 +4 2 = 5 cm.
7. The reason is that the points (6, 5) and (6, -5) are symmetri-
cally opposite with regard to the ar-axis, which is the line
of centres. [See p. 143, lII.]
8. The st. line, through the centre, perp. to one of the par 1 chords,
is perp. to the other [Th. 14]. And this st. line bisects
both chords [ Th. 31]. Hence, the st. line joining the
middle pts. of two par 1 chords passes through the centre.
9. The st. line, through the centre, perp. to one of the par 1 chords,
is perp. to all of them [Th. 14], And this st. line bisects
all the chords. Hence it is the required locus.
10. Let AB, CD be two chords bisecting one another at E. If
possible let some other pt. O be the centre ; then, by
Theor. 31, Z.OEA and Z.OEC are both rt. l?, which is
impossible. Thus no other pt. but E can be the centre,
and each chord is therefore a diameter.
11. The diagonals of a par m bisect one another ; ;. by the previous
Ex. their pt. of intersection is the centre.
12. Let the par m ABCD be inscribed in aO. Then the diagonals
AC, BD intersect in O, the centre of the O [Ex. 11].
Hence the diags. are equal, being diameters of the O ;
the parm. ABCD is a rectangle. [See Ex. 5, p. 59.]
Page 151.
1. Since equal chords are equidistant from the centre, the locus
is a circle, whose centre is the centre of the given circle
and whose radius is equal to the distance of any of the
chords from the centre.


2. Let chords AB, CD cut in E. Let F be the centre. Draw
FG, FH perp. to AB, CD respectively. Then the A“FEG,
FEH are congruent [Th. 17]. ;. GF = HF; .'. the chords
AB, CD are equidistant from the centre, and are therefore
equal [ Th. 34].
■J. Take Fig. of preceding Ex. Then EG = EH. But BG, HD,
the halves of AB, CD [Th. 31], are equal. .'. the whole
or remainder BE = whole or remainder DE.
4. With centre A, on the 0“ of the given ©, and with radius
equal to the required length, cut the given circle in B.
From the centre of the given circle, draw a st. line perp.
to the required direction and equal to the distance of the
centre from AB. The chord drawn through the extremity
of this st. line, par 1 to the given direction, will be the
chord required.
5. Let Obe the centre : and AX, BY, OZ the perp* on PQ. Then
OZ=half the sum or diff. of AX and BY, according as A
and B are on the same or opposite sides of PQ [Ex. 9, p. 65].
.’. the sum or difference of AX and BY = twice OZ=a constant.
6. For a theoretical proof see Ex. 1.
Let AB be any such chord, F its mid-pt., O the centre.
Then OF 2 = OA 2 —AF 2 =(4T) 2 -(0'9) 2 = 16; .'. OF = 4‘o cm.
7. As in Fig. of 111. p. 143, we have OR 2 =O P 2 - P R 2 =(3'7) 2 - (T 2) 2 ;
whence OR = 3‘5".
Hence take O, O' at a distance of 4", measure off OR = 3 - 5", and
draw RP, RQ perp. to OR on either side of it and each
equal to I‘2". Then P, Q are the pts. of intersection.
PO' 2 = PR 2 + RO' 2 =(l -2) 2 +(o-5) 2 ; whence PO' = 1 -3".
Page 153.
1. Let O be the centre, F the given pt. Join OF, and through
F draw AFB perp. to OF. Then AB is the least chord.
’For draw through F any other chord PFQ and let OX be the
perp. to it from the centre. Then OXF is a rt. th A and
.'. its hypotenuse OF > OX. Thus AB is further from the
centre than PQ ; .’. AB < PQ.


2. Bisect BC at D. Through D draw DE perp. to BC and
meeting AB in E. Then Eis the req d centre.
Since (3 - 7) 2 =(3'5) 2 +(T2) 2 , is art. L [Th. 30]. DE
is par 1 to AC and consequently bisects AB. [Ex. 1, p. 64.]
Hence radius = EB = TB5".
3. See Theor. 32, or Prob. 25, p. 193.
4. Let XZY, X'Z'Y' be two chords bisected at Z and Z' in AB, of
which Zis nearer than Z' to C the middle pt. of AB. Let
Obe the centre. Then OC, OZ, OZ' are respectively perp.
to AB, XY, XT. Also OZ'>OZ>OC [Th. 12. Cor. 3J.
.’. XT <XY < AB. Hence AB is the greatest length of
XY, and XY increases as Z approaches C. When Z coincides
with A or B, XY vanishes.
5. Let Pbe (2-4", IT), Qbe (P 8", 2 - 4"), O the origin. Then it
is found from Tneor. 29 that OP=OQ,=3 0".
Through P, Q draw PN, Q.M perp. to OX. Let Rbe mid-pt.
of PQ, and RS its perp. on OX.
Through P draw PK perp. to QM.
(i) Then PK=o'6", QK=o'6". .‘. PQ 2 = PK 2 4-QK 2 = 072;
whence PQ=O - 85" (nearly).
(ii) By Ex. 3, p. 134 the coords, of R are
Tt(2'4"+TB") and |-(l'8"+2'4"), namely, (2T, 2T).
(iii) Since R is the mid-pt. of PQ, OR is the perp. distance
of O from PQ.
Hence OR 2 =OS 2 +SR 2 =B - 82 ; whence OR=2’97" (nearly).
Page 155.
1. Let Pbe the fixed point, AB the given st. line; and let any
one of the circles having its centre in AB and passing
through P cut the line through P perp. to AB again in Q
Then, by Theor. 31, Q is the image of P in AB [see p. 141];
that is, Q is a fixed point.
2. Let AB be the common chord of two ©• whose centres are
E, F ; and let the st. line par 1 to. AB cut one O at P, Q
and the other at X, Y. Join EF, cutting PQ at O. Then
EF is perp. to AB [III. p. 143], /. EF is perp. to PQ
[Th. 141. OP=OQ; and OX=OY [Th. 31], Hence
PX=QY,


3. Let the two 0“ intersect in A, B. Let CAD, EBF be par 1
lines cutting the one circle in C, E and the other in D, F.
Then the st. line through the centre of ABEC, perp. to the
chords AC, BE, bisects these chords in P and Q, say.
Similarly the st. line through the centre of ABFD perp. to
the chords AD, BF bisects these chords in X and Y, say.
But PQ is par 1 to XY [Th. 14], .-. PX =QY [ Th . 20].
But CA is double of PA, and AD is double of AX. CD
is double of PX. Similarly EF is double of QY;
;. CD = EF.
4. Let the two 0“ intersect at A, B ; and let PAQ, XAY be two
st. lines equally inclined to AB and terminated by the
0° e . Through B draw P'S®' par 1 to PQ. Then
P'Q' =PQ [Ex. 3]. Now the L XAB = the z.P'BA ; whence
it may be shewn that XA = P'B [Th. 34, Converse];
and similarly AY=BQ'. .". XY = P'Q'=PQ.
5. With the notation of the Fig. of 111., p. 143, we have
OR = VOP- i:r PR2 W 37 2 -12 2 =\/49 x 25 = 35"
and RO'=VO'P 2 -PR 2 =V20 2 -12 2 =V32x8=16".
.-. CO'=OR+RO'=sl".
6. With the notation of the previous Ex. (O being the centre of
the larger 0), let OR=.r inches ; /. O'R=(2T -x) inches.
Now OP 2 —OR 2 = PR 2 =o'P 2 -0'R 2 ;
/. (1 -7) 2 -x 2 = PR 2 =(l-0) 2 - (2T - x) 2 .
Hence x=V5; and .-. PR=V(L7) 2 -(1 -5) 2 =o‘B".
Thus the common chord = 2PR = l - 6", and its distances from
the centres are 1 - 5" and o’6" respectively.

1. Let A, Bbe the centres of the two ©•; and D, E the pts.
where AB (produced both ways) cuts the O CM . Let any
other line PQ cut the O oes at P and Q. Join QA, and
produce it to cut the “A” circle at R. Then AE>AQ
[Th. 37]. To these unequals add the radii DA, RA
respectively. Then DE > RQ. But QR >QP [Th. 37] :
.-. DE>PQ.
Similarly, if AB cuts the 0““ at F, G, it may. be shewn that
FG<PQ.


2. Let Cbe the centre of the O, A any pt. on the O", ACB
the diameter, AD, AF any other chords ; and let Z.ACD be
greater than l AC F.
Then (i) AC + CD>AD [Th. 11], ButCD = CP; ;. AB>AD.
(ii) AC, CD = AC, CF, each to each, but i ACD > ;
base AD > base AF. [Th. 19.]
3. Let the two o s , whose centres are E and F, cut at A, B.
Let FAQ be the st. line through A par 1 to EF and ter-
minated by the O ce “, and let XAY be any other st. line
terminated by the O oes .
From E, F draw EG, FH perp. to XY ; and from E draw EK
perp. to FH. Then XY is double of GH, that is, double
of EK [Th. 31]. Similarly PQ, is double of EF. But in the
rt.-angled A EKF, EF is greater than EK. PQ is
greater than XY.
4. As in 111., p. 143, the pt. of intersection will be the image
of (8, —11) in tbe x-axis, and its coords, are therefore (8,11).
5. Let the points in the given order be A, B, C. Then the radii
of the 0 s are AC, BC. AC 2 = 15 2 + 8 2 , whence AC = 17.
Similarly BC 2 =6 2 + 8 2 ; whence BC = 10., Again the 2 nd pt.
of intersection is the image of C in the line of centres AB,
that is, the pt. (0, -8).
6. It will be found that each of the angles APB, AQ8,... is 40°.
Hence we infer that angles in the same segment of a
circle are equal. (See Theor. 39.)
Taking the angle at O to be 70°, each of the angles APB etc.
will be found to be 35°, which suggests that the angle in
a segment is half the angle subtended at the centre by
the chord of the segment. (See Theor. 38.)

By Theor. 38, L BOG = 2z. BDC = 230°.
3. From A BDC, L BDC = 180° - (43°+ 82°) = 55°. [Th. 16,]
by Theor. 39, L BAG = L BDC = 55°.
Also L BOC=2/_ BDC = 110° ;

4. Denote L BAG by A.
Then reflex L BOC = 2A. L BOG = 360° - 2A.

3. The line joining the vertex of an isosceles A to the middle
pt. of the base is perp. to the base [Ex. 1, p. 26]. Hence
the © on a side as diameter passes through the middle pt.
of the base. [Ex. I.]
4. Both the circles described on the sides of a A as diameters

6. Let Abe the fixed point, C the centre of the ©, and APQ any
chord through A, meeting the O ce at P, Q. Let X be the

That is, the Z. AXC is a rt. angle, and since AC is a fixed base,

half the difference of the arcs AC, BD.
8. Let AB, CD two chorda of a 0 intersect at rt. L‘ at E.
Then by Ex. 6, the L AEC is equal to the sum of the U sub-
tended at the O ce by AC, BD.
That is the sum of the arcs AC, BD subtend a rt. angle at the

12. Let PA, PB cut the other Oin Q and R. Join BQ.
(1) Let Q and Rbe in PA, PB produced. Then by Theor. 16,
<LQBR = sum of z_ s BQA, BPA = sum of U subtended at
the O ces by AB = constant.
(2) Let Q and Rbe in PA, PB. Then Z.QBR = difference of

the two 0 s by AB = constant.
(3) PB and Qin PA produced. Then L QBR = sup-
plement of U BQA, BPA=supplement of U subtended at

13. Let AB, CD be par 1 chords of a 0. Then L ADC =Z- DAB
[Th. 14], .'. arc AC = arc BD [77/.. 42], isff chord AC
= chord BD [Th. 45]. And z.CAB= supplement of z_ ACD
[Th. 14] = z_ABD [Th. 40]. /. chord BC = chord AD
[Th. .42, 45], ■
14. By Theor. 3, PX and QY subtend equal Uat the O ce * of equal
0 8 . Hence arc PX = arc QY. Hence chord PX = chord QY.
[Th. 45.]
15. Each of the given lines = the common chord [Ex. 13].
16. Since the chord AB is common to the two equal ©', the arc AE

[Th. 43]. /. BP=BQ.
17. The chords BX, XA, AY, YC are equal, for each subtends at

Hence, if the base U are each double of the vertical L , the
pentagon is equilateral.
18. Join PR, QR, and BR. Then PR, QR shall he in one st. line.
For L PRB = the supp* of L PCB [Th. 40.]

.'. P, R, Q are collinear.
19. Let P and Xbe on BC, Qon CA. Then QX=QC [Ex. 1, p. 165].

.'. AQXP=/.PRQ, or its supph P, R, Q, X are concyclic.
[Th. 40. Con.]
20. Let Y and Zbe the feet of the perp s from B and Con CA and
AB, respectively. Then, as in Ex. 19, P, Q,R, Y and P, Q, R,
Z are concyclic. But only one circle can pass through P, Q,
R [Th. 32]. Hence the six pts. P, Q, R, X, Y, Z are concyclic.


21. If all the given A 1 stand on a fixed base BC, and have a given
vertical angle, they also have the same circumscribed circle
[2%. 39. Converse],
Take BAG, any one of these A s , and let the bisector of the
Z. A meet the circurn-circle at X.
Then BAX = z_CAX [Hypi], arc BX = arc CX [Th. 42].
.'. X, being the middle point of the arc BC, is same for all
triangles of the series.
22. I haw CF perp. to AE. Then AE bisects the L BAG \Th. 43],
Hence L FCB=half the diff. of the u at B and C
[Ex. 2, p. 138]. Now DE, EA are respectively perp. to
BC, CF.
.-. L DEA =Z. BCF [Ex. 8, p. 43]
=half the diff. of the A at B and C.
Page 177.
1. Let AB be a chord of the outer 0, touching the inner Oat M.
Then if O be the common centre, ONIA is a rt. L and .'. AM = MB.
Hence AM 2 =A0 2 -0M 2 = 16. /. AM =4 cm.
And AB = SAM =8 cm.
The chords are all equal, since they are equidistant from the
centre of the O in which they lie.
2. Let AB be any such chord, M its middle point. Then OMA is
a rt. L. OM 2 =OA 2 -AM 2 = 0'36. Thus CM =O-6".
Thus all the mid.-pts. lie on a concentric circle, whose
radius = 0 - 6". Also since Z.OMA is always a rt. L , each
chord will be a tangent to this circle.
3. With the notation of Ex. 1., AM 2 <=(s) 2 —(2'5) 2 = 18'75. Whence
AM =4’33 ...cm. Thus AB=2AM = B'7 cm. (tonearest mm.).
4. Since OPT is a rt. L, TP 2 =T0 2 —0P 2 =144. .-. TP=l2".
5. With the figure of Theor. 47, T0 2 =(o - 7) 2 + (2 - 4) 2 =6’25. Thus
TO = 2-5".
6. Let Obe the centre of a O touching AB and AC in B and C.
Then in the rt.-angled A 8 ABO, AGO, OB = OC, OA is
common, and U ABO, AGO are rt. U'\ [Th. 46.]
.'. L OAB=a OAC. [Th. 18.]
7. Let AO cut BC in D. Then, by Theor. 47, AB =AC ; and, by
Ex. 6., L BAD=z.CAD. ;. A 8 BAD, CAD are congruent
[Th. 4] ; whence BD = DC and z_BDA=z.CDA.


8. L OPQ =L OTQ in segment OPTQ. Similarly L OQP =Z- OTP.
But i.OPQ=Z.OQP [Th. 5] ; .'. i.PTQ=2/.OPQ.
9. Let CD, BE be the two par 1 tangents at the extremities of the
diameter CAB : and DFE a tangent at F.
Then the A 8 ABE, AFE are identically equal [Th. 47, Cor.].
.'. AE bisects L BAF. Similarly AD bisects L CAF.
.'. DAE is art. L [Ex. 6, p. 13].
10. The tangent at an extremity of a diameter is perp. to the
diameter. .’. the chords par 1 to the tangent are also perp.
to the diameter, and are bisected by it [Th. 31].
11. The required locus is the perp. to the given st. line through
the given pt. [Th. 46].
12. The required locus is the st. line which is par 1 to the two
given st. lines and equidistant from them,
13. The required locus is the pair of bisectors of the angles
between the two given st. lines. [See Ex. 6 and I'rob. 15.]
14. Let ABCD be the quad 1 , and P, Q, R, S the points of contact
of the sides AB, BC, CD, DA.
Then AS=AP [Th. 47, Corf and DS=DR; .'. by addition
AD = AP+DR. Similarly BC = BP+ CR.
Hence AD + BC = AP4-BP + DR + CR = AB+DC.
The converse is : If the sum of one pair of opposite sides of a
quad is equal to the sum of the other pair then a circle may
be inscribed in the figure.
Let ABCD be a quad 1 in which AB +CD= BC + DA. By bi-
secting the two L‘ ABC, BCD, describe a 0 to touch three
sides AB, BC, CD [iVo6.-26]. Then shall AD also touch
this O. For if not, let AD' touch the 0 and cut CD
at D'. Now by hyp., AB +CD= BC + AD. Also, by above,
AB + CD' =BC + AD'. .■. taking the differences of these
equals, DD' = the difference of AD and AD'; hence either
AD'=AD + DD', or AD = AD'+DD'; which is impossible
[Th. 11].
15. With the figure and notation of first part of Ex. 14, O being
the centre of the 0, we have LAO P =L AOS [Th. 47, Cor.] and
aBOP=Z.BOQ; ."., by addition, AOB =/_ BOQ +Z. AOS.
Similarly Z-COD=z. DOS.
Hence z.AOB + = /. BOC+Z.AOD.
But these four U together make up 360°. .'. each pair = 180°,
i.e. L‘ AOB, COD are supplementary.

1. The point on the line of centres which is 17" from the centre
of the larger O and o'9" from the centre of the smaller O
clearly lies on each O. Also, by Theor. 11, there can be
no other pt. of intersection; .'. the O' touch at this
point.
xn general, when the distance between two centres is equal to
the sum of the radii, the O' touch at a pt. between the
two centres and the contact is external.
When the distance between the two centres is equal to the
difference of the two radii, the contact is internal.
3. By Theor. 29, c= 10 cm. Let the 0 with centre A cut AB in
P, and BA produced in Q. Then BP=3 cm. and BQ =l7 cm.
Hence O' with centre B, and radii 3 cm. and 17 cm., will
touch the given O with external and internal contact
respectively.
4. Let the 0, centre P, touch the large O, at Q, and the smaller
O at R, and let the pt. of contact of the two given O' be
C. Then, by Theor. 48, APQ, PRB, ABC are all st. lines.
.'. AP+PB=AP+PR+RB=AP+PQ+BC=AQ+BC
= sum of radii of given O s = a constant.
5. Let P, Qbe the mid-pts. of AC, CB respectively, R the centre of
the fourth 0, and D its pt. of contact with the semicircle
on AB. Then, by Theor. 48, CRD is a st. line. Since
PRQ is isosceles, and C the mid-pt. of PQ, we have
RCQ=rt. angle [Th. 7].
Let r inches be the req d radius. Then PR=r +I,CR = 2 - r.
Now PR 2 = CR 2 + CP 2 [Th. 29], .-. (r+l) 2 = (2-r) 2 +l 2 .
Whence r ?/'.
6. Let Cbe the pt. of contact. Then A, C, B are in a st. line
[Th. 48]. Because AC=AP, .'. z. ACP=z_ APC. And
because BC = BQ, .'. L BCQ=z. BQC. But L ACP=Z. BCQ.
.'. Z. APC =Z_ BQC. .’. AP, BQ are parallel.
7. With the figure of Ex. 6, let PT, QK (drawn in opp. direc-
tions) be the tangents at P, Q. Then, as above, z_'APC,
BQC are equal.
But z.'APT, BQK are rt. L* ; .'. Z.CPT=Z.CQK; .-. PT, QK
are par 1 [Th. 13].


8. (i) The required locus is the st. line through the centre of the
given O and the given pt. [ Th. 48].
(ii) Let O be the centre of the given 0, OP its radius. On
PO, or OP produced, take PC equal to the given radius of
the circles which are to touch the given O. Then the ©
with centre C and radius CP will touch the given O at P.
And 00 = the sum or diff. of OP and CP. Hence the
required locus is a circle with centre O and radius equal
to the sum or diff. of the radius of the given circle and the
given radius of the touching circle.
9. Let Abe the centre of the given O, B the given pt. Let AB
produced cut the given oin 0 and D. The © described
with centre B and radius BC or BD will touch the given
0. Hence there are two solutions except when Bis on
the O m of the given 0.
10. Let Abe the centre of the given Oof radius b, P the given pt.
Take PC equal to a, either on PA (produced if necessary)
or on AP produced. The circles described with centre C
and radius CP will touch the given circle at P: but, if
a=6, one of the two circles so described will coincide
with the given circle.

2. Each of the l? made by the tangents with the line joining their
pts. of’ contact is equal to the angle in the alt. segment,
these U are equal. .’. the tangents are equal [Th. 6],
3. Let T'AT be the common tangent to the two O s at A, AX being
between AP and AT.
Then . _TAX = iAPX. [Th. 49.]
And, in (i), l TAX = L AQY :
in (ii), l. TAX = L T'AY = L AQY.
;. in (i) and in (ii) l AQY = L APX.
PX is par 1 to QY.


4. Tangent at Ato the O through O makes with AO an l equal
to L OBA in alternate segment. But because Ois centre of
the other 0, OA = 08. .'. /.OBA=/.OAB. .'. AO bisects
'L between AB and the tangent at A.
6. The tangent at P makes with PAC an L equal to L PBA =/_ ABD
(or its supplement) = /.ACD (or its supplement). .'. tangent
at P is par 1 to CD.
6. Let Abe pt. of contact, AB chord through A, 0 the middle pt.

/. CM=CN.
Page 181.
2. From Theor. 31 we know that if AB be any chord drawn
through a pt. A on the O and D its middle point, then
/.ODB is a rt. L.
This is true however near B approaches to A. If B moves up
to coincidence with A, the chord AB becomes the tangent
AT, and D coincides with A; hence the z. ODB becomes the
L OAT and the theorem becomes
“ If A be any point on a 0 and AT the tangent at A, then
/.OAT is a rt. angle.”
3. Let A, Bbe the centres of the'two O’ in Fig. 1, p. 173, and
let M be the mid.-pt. of the common chord PQ. Let Q,
move up to coincidence with P. Then whatever be the
position of PQ we know that A, B, M are in one straight
line. This must .'. be true in the final position when Q
coincides -with P, and M with each of them. Hence if
two O’, centres A and B, touch one another at P, then
A, P, B are collinear.
4. Let ABCD be the cyclic quad 1 having BC produced to F.
Then /. DCF=/.BAD. [Ex. 5, p. 163.]
Now let C move along the circumference until it coincides
with B. Then secant BCF becomes the tangent at B, and
the L DCF becomes the L DBT, where BT is the tangent
at B. Hence if BT be the tangent at B, and BD a secant
through B, then L DBT =L BAD in alternate segment.


5. In the Fig. erf p. 164, let C move along the O co until it
coincides with B. Then the chord CB becomes the tangent
at B, and AC becomes the diameter AB. Hence the L
between the tangent at B and the diameter through B is
a rt. angle.

(ii) Two direct, and a third at the point of contact.
(iii) One, —at the point of contact.
Let A be the centre of the T 4" O, and B of the TO" O ;
(i) The ©’ will intersect, and there will be two direct, and
no transverse common tangents ; for B will be within the
O of construction for transverse tangents.
(ii) The ©’ will touch externally, and there will he two
direct common tangents, and one transverse at the point
of contact of the two o s . For B will be on the © of
construction for transverse tangents.
(iii) The © s will touch internally, and there will be one
direct common tangent at the point of contact, since B
will be on the © of construction ; and no transverse
common tangents.
(iv) The © 3 will neither touch nor cut each other, and there
will be two direct and two transverse common tangents.
2. No transverse common tangents exist. With the Fig. and
notation of Prob. 23, AB = 2 - 0", AC = T 2", and ACB is a
rt. L; .-. DE 2 = BC 3 =AB 2 - AC'' = 2'56 ; .-. DE = T 6".
Similarly the other tangent= T 6".

Similarly the other direct tangent = T 7", nearly. There is a
transverse common tangent of unlimited length at the pt.
of contact of the two O’.
4. Proceeding as before, the lengths of the common tangents are
found to be T9B" nearly. To find the common chord
proceed as in Ex. 6, p. 155. '
5. Proceeding as in Prob. 23, we shall obtain two direct and two
transverse common tangents.


6. In this case the 0 of construction is reduced to a point.
Proceed thus :— join AB the centres of the given ©*, and
draw AD, BE perp. to AB, cutting the O es in D and E.
Join DE, which will be one direct common tangent.
[Proof by Theors. 13, 20, and 46.]
7. Let a pair of common tangents, touch the greater ©at D, D',
the smaller at E, E', and cut one another at P.
Then by Theor. 47, Cor., PD = PD', and PE = PE'. .
.•. for direct tangents PD - PE = PD' - PE';
and for transverse tangents PD + PE = PD' + PE' ;
.'. in either case DE = D'E'.
Or again, with the Fig. of p. 185, DE = BC; similarly D'E'= BC ■,
but BC = BC'; DE = D'E'. If the 0 s are equal, then
the direct common tangents are equal [Th. 20],
8. Let the direct common tangents DE, D'E' touch the 0’ whose
centres are A, B at D, E and D', E', and cut one another
at P. Join PB, BE, BE'. Then in the A” PEB, PE'B, we
have BE= BE' and BP common, also the A PEB, PE'B are
rt. L‘ [ Th. 46] ;
/.EPB = £.E'PB [Th. 18],
That is, the centre B lies on the bisector of the l between the
common tangents. Similarly the centre A lies on the same
bisector. the points A, B, P are collinear. Similarly, if
the transverse tangents cut at Q, then A, B, Q are collinear.
9. Let B, Cbe the centres of the two given O 5: then BC passes
through A [Th. 48], Join BP, CQ.
Then Z.BAP+Z.CAQ=/.BPA + Z.CQA
= 90° - L APQ + 90° - l AQP
= + = IPAQ. [Th. 16.]
Hence L PAQ is half of two rt. U ; that is, the L PAQ is a rt. L.
Page 189.
1. See Theorem 32, or Problem 25, p. 193.
2. The centre lies on the line through A perp. to PQ. [Th. 47.]
On the perp. to AB through its middle pff. [Th. 32.]
Through A draw AO perp. to PQ; draw CO bisecting AB at
rt. angles, and meeting AO at O. With centre O and
radius OA describe a O, which will be the 0 required.


3. The centre lies on CA, or CA produced.
Draw EO bisecting AB at rt. angles, to meet CA at O. The
centre of the © must lie on both CA and EO, and -will
therefore be at O ; and its radius will be OA or 08.
4. Draw a line XY par 1 to AB on the same side as P and at a
distance' 3‘2 cm. from AB ; with centre P and radius
3 - 2 cm. cut XY at Q and R. With centres Q, and R, and
radii QP, RP respectively, describe 0 s : they will be the
0 s required.
5. Let A and Bbe the centres of the 3'o cm. and 2'o cm. ©“
respectively. With centres A and B, and radii (3'o + 3'5) cm.
and (2'o + 3'5) cm. respectively, describe ©• cutting at P
and Q: then the two circles whose centres are P and
Q, and whose radii are 3"5 cm., will touch each of the
given O’ externally.
Let r be the radius ; then 3+r +2 + r<£6 \Th. !!•]; .'. 2r<f 1,
or Hence the radius of the smallest O is o's cm.
6. Since the 0 touches both OA and 08, its centre is equidistant
from these lines. .". it must lie on one of the bisectors
of the angles formed by OA, 08. [Pro6. 15.]
Draw a line par 1 to OA, distant I'2" from it, to cut these
bisectors at P and Q. Then the 0 s of radius I'2" whose
centres are at P and Q will each touch OA and 08. There
will be four O s , for the parallel line can be drawn on
either side of OA.
7. Draw a line XY par 1 to AB, distant 2’5 cm. from it, and on the
same side of it as the centre of the given O. Draw a ©
of radius (3 - 5 + 2'5) or 6 cm., concentric with the given O,
to cut XY at P and Q,: these pts. will be the centres of
the two os,0 s , of radii 2'5 cm., which can be drawn to touch
the given © and the given line AB. [Proof by (iv) and
(v), p. 188.]
♦
8. Let the transversal out the two par 1 lines PA, QB at A and
B respectively ; then the centre of the required O is
equidistant from PA and AB; .'. it must lie on the bisector
of the L PAB. Similarly it must lie on the bisector of
L. Q.BA. .'. it is at the point of intersection of these
bisectors ; and the radius will be the perp. let fall from
this point of intersection on any one of the lines.
Since the centre can be the pt. of intersection of either the
internal or external bisectors there will be two O’. And
these will be equal, for in each case the radius is half the
distance between the par 1 lines.


9. Let Cbe the centre of the given O, PQ the given line, and A
the given pt. in PQ.
At A draw AF perp. to PQ ; then the centre of the required
© must lie in AF.
Draw BA a diam r of the given ©, perp. to PQ. Join A to
one extremity Dof the diam r , cutting the O ce at E. Join
CE, and produce it to cut AF at F.
Then F is the centre, and FA the radius of the required © ;
and a second solution is got by joining AB. [Proof by
Th. 46, 48.]
10. Let PQ be the given st. line, and E the given point on the O
of which Cis the centre. Draw the diameter BD perp. to
PQ. Join DE (or BE), and produce it to meet PQ at A.
Draw AF perp. to PQ; and join CE, producing it to
cut AF at F. Then F is the centre of the required ©.
11. The three given st. lines are supposed to be of infinite length.
The locus of the centres of 0 s touching any pair must be
the internal and external bisectors of the angle between
them. Four different centres will be given by the inter-
section of these loci, corresponding to what are known as
the inscribed and escribed ©“ of the A formed by the
three given lines. [See Probs. 26, 27, p. 194.]
Page 191.
1. On the given base describe a segment containing an angle
equal to the given L . The pt. or pts. in which the arc of
the segment cuts the given st. line will give the required
vertex.
2. The required vertex is the intersection of the arc of the
segment described on the base to contain an l equal to
the given L. , and
(i) the circle, whose centre is an extremity of the base and
radius is equal to the given side.
(ii) the st. line parallel to the base at a distance from it equal
to the given altitude.
(iii) the circle whose centre is the middle pt. of the base and
radius equal to the given median.
(iv) the perp. to the base drawn through the given point.
3. Because arc AP=arc BP ; .'. L AOP=L BCP- [7%. 43.]


4. Because /_ACB=K, and z_AXB=JK,
z.CBX =JK [Th. 16]=Z.CXB.
CB =CX [Th. 6]; AC + CB=AX = given length.
p. On AB, the given base, describe a segment containing an L
equal to the given L K ; also another segment containing
an angle equal to 90° + |K. From centre A, with radius
equal to the given difference of the sides, describe a ©
cutting the last drawn segment in X. Join AX and pro-
duce it to cut the first segment in C. Then ABC is the
required triangle.
Because z.AXB = 90°+|K, /. tCXB = 90°-|K. [Th. I.]
And z.XCB=K, ” z.CBX=9O°-JK. [Th. 16.]
CB=CX. [Th. (!.] .-. AC-CB=AX=givenlength.
Page 198.
1, Take any point A on the O and draw RAQ perp. to the
radius OA, and .’. a tangent; draw lines AB, AC making
the U RAB, QAC each 60°; let them meet the 0 at B and
C ; then ABC is the triangle required. [Proh. 28].
To circumscribe an equil. A, draw tangents at B and C
meeting at P and cutting RQ at- R and Q respectively.
Then PQR will be the triangle required.
For QA =QC [Th. 47, Cor.] ; /. <IQCA=z.QAC = 60°.
L Q=6o° [Th. 16]; similarly L. R = 60°.
.'. L P=6o° [Th. 16] ; and the A PQR is equilateral.
2. The circles are drawn as in Prob. 25, 26, 27.
In the case of an equilateral A the bisector of an angle also
bisects the opposite side at rt. L‘ ; .'. the centres of the
circum-cirole and in-circle coincide at the intersection of
the medians. Let Ibe the common centre, ABC the A, X
the mid-pt. of BC, lj the centre of the © escribed to BC.
Then is a st. line [Proh. 27. Note 2]. Also AI = 2XI.
[p. 97, 111. Cor.] .'. the radius of the circum-circle is
double that of the in-circle.
Again, L l l ßX=6o° =Z. ABC ; L BXl!=9o° = BXA;
by Theor. 17, Xlj=XA = 3XI [p. 97].
That is, the radius of the escribed © is three times the radius
of the inscribed ©.


3. The A 8 being drawn, the 0‘ can be described as in Prob. 25.
The angle A will be found to be 64° in Cases (i), (ii); and
180° —64° in Case (iii) [ Th . 16].
Since the side a is of the same length in each case, the A 8 can
be described on the same line as base ; .'. if A 1( A 2, A 3, be
the vertices of the 3 A B , A t and A 2 will lie on the segmerit
of a © containing an L of 64° described on BC as chord,
and A 3 on the conjugate segment of the same © [Th. 39
and 40, Converse]. the radii of the 3 circum-oircles
are equal.
4. The A 8 being described as in Ex. 1, let Obe the centre of the
given 0, and X the mid.-pt. of BC.
Then OA=4 cm. .'. OX=2 cm. [p. 97, 111. Oor.].
But BXO is a rt. L? A. .'. BX 2 = OB 2 -OX 2 ;
whence BX = 2*/3 cm. =3'464 cm. and .'. CB = 6'928 cm.
Now area of A ABC =\. AX .BC = |(6 x 6'928) sq. cm.
= 20‘78 sq. cm.
It was proved in Ex. 1 that AQC was an equil. A. So for
ARB, PBC. each of these three A 8 is equal to ABC in
area. .’. A PCJR is 4 times A ABC.
5. With the Figure of Prob. 26 we have
area of A IBC=£. ID .BC [Th. 25.]
=i r . a.
Similarly A ICA=^r. h ; and A lAB = ir. c.
Now AABC=A)BC + AICA+AIAB
= \r{a + h + c).
In the numerical example r will be found to be 2'24 cm.
6. With the Figure of Prob. 27 we have, as above,
area of A I x BC = ir l a ; similarly for the A 8 I x CA, IxABl x AB ;
Now AABC=AI I CA+AIjAB-A^BC
= \r x {h + c-a).
In the numerical example r x will be found to be 6 cm.
7. By measurement R will be found to be 3'2 cm. nearly ; and
fv i°2) Pa t° 2’4 cm., 5'04 cm. and 2’96 cm. respectively.


Page 199.
1. Join the extremities of any two perp. diameters. Proof by
Theorems 4 and 41.
If r is the radius of the circle, and a the side of the square,
we have a? =r l + r 2 \Th. 29] = 2 - 25 + 2 - 25 = 4'50. a = 2T2".
2. Take two diameters at right angles, and draw the perps. at
their extremities. Proof by Theors. 14, 20, and 46.
If r is the radius of the circle, the side of the square is 2r;
the area = (2r) 2 =4r 2 .
As in Ex. 1, the area of the inscribed square is 2r 2 . area
of the circumscribed square is twice that of the inscribed
square.
3. Draw the diagonals, which are axes of symmetry of the square
[Ex. 2, p. 60], Hence the centre of the inscribed circle
must lie on each of them [Ex. 6, p. 177], and .'. be at
their pt. of intersection. Also, by symmetry, the pts. of
contact of the © must be the middle pts. of the sides ;
the radius is equal to half the side of the square.
4. Let ABCD be the square, and O the intersection of its diagonals.
Describe a 0 with O as centre and OA as radius. By
measurement, the diameter will be found to be 8 - 5 cm.
The diameter of the circle is a diagonal of the square; .’. if
dbe its length, cf 2 =6 2 +6 2 = 72 ; whence cf=B - 48 cm.
5. For Construction, see Prob. 10, p. 83. Let abe the length of
the other side, dof the diameter; then d 2 =a- + 9 \Tk. 29],
and cf=3 - 6; whence ct 2 = 3’96. And .'. a=2'o", to the
nearest tenth of an inch.
If PCJRS is any inscribed rectangle, PR will be a diameter, for
PQR is a rt. angle. O, the intersection of the diagonals,
is the centre of the O. Now the area of the rect. = twice
that of A PQR = PR xp, where p is the perp. from Q, on PR.
Hence the area is greatest when p is greatest, i.e. when
jo = the radius. Hence OQ must be perp. to PR; by
means of Theor. 4, the rectangle must be a square.
k.s.g. G


6. Let ABC be the triangle, I the centre, X the mid-pt. of BC.
As in Ex. 2, p. 198, AI = 2XI. Xl=~.
But B1 2 = BX 2 + XI 2 ; .-. r 2 = (-J + whence ft 2 = 3r-’.
And for the square, since its diagonal is a diameter of the
circle, (2r) 2 =a 2 + a 2; whence d i = 2r l .
3a 2 = 6r 2 = 2i 2 .
7. The angle subtended by a side of an inscribed square at any
point on the major arc is half the angle subtended at the
centre, that is, half a right angle.
But the sum of the angles in the major and minor arc is two
rt. angles [Th. 40],
hence the angle in the minor arc is % of a rt. angle.
8. Draw any two diameters AOC, BOD, and draw PQ, QR, RS,
SP perp. to the radii at A, B, C, D respectively; then these
lines are tangents. [ Th. 47.]
Now, by Theor. 13, PQRS is a par" 1 ; also OP, OR bisect the
vertically opposite angles AOD, 800, respectively [Th. 47];
.-. POR is a st. line ;
.-. Z.PRS=Z.RPQ [Th. 14]=z.SPR [Th. 47].
.'. SP=SR [Th. s]. Similarly SP=PQ, PQ=QR.
.'. the par m is equilateral, and is consequently a rhombus.
9. In BC, CD, DA make BY, CZ, DW each equal to AX.
Join XY, YZ, ZW, WX. Then XYZW is the sq. required.
Jfor the A 3 XBY, YCZ, ZDW, WAX are all identically equal
[Th. 4], the fig. XYZW is equilateral.
Also, Z.ZYC =Z. YXB ;
.-. Z-ZYC + Z-XYB =Z. YXB + /.XYB = one rt. L [Th. 16].
Z.XYZ is a rt. L. Similarly each of the other Uof the
figure is a rt. L : .'. it is a square.
10. The sq. of minimum area is that, obtained by joining in order
the middle points of the sides of the given square.
For a square is a minimum when its diagonal is a minimum :
and the least line that can be drawn between two opp.
sides of the given square is perp. to those sides ; this is
obtained by joining the middle points.


11. (i) The diags. of a rect. being equal, the intersection of the
diagonals is the centre [Th. 21. Cor. 3].
(ii) Through the, vertices of the given rect., draw lines,
external to the figure, making u of 45° with its sides.
12. (i) Let.OAB be the quadrant, AB being the arc.
Bisect the rt. /.AOB by OD, meeting the arc at D ; draw DF
perp. to OA ; bisect the /.ODF by DE, meeting OA at E ;
and at E draw EC perp. to OA, meeting OD in C. Then C
is the centre of the required ©.
For /.CED = alt. L EDF=/. EDO \_C'onstr.\.
CD = CE. And if CG is drawn perp. to 08, then CE =CG
[Ex. 2, p. 49].
Finally, since the u at E and G are rt. angles, .'. a O
described from centre C with radius CD touches the arc
and the radii of the quadrant.
(ii) In this example it is understood that one angle of the
square is to coincide with the angle between the radii.
Bisect the /.AOB by OD, and draw DF, DH perp. to OA, 08.
Then OFDH is the square required.
For L FOD=| rt. L, and L DFO is a rt. L.
/.ODF=| rt.'/.; .'. OF=DF. And since the fig. is a
rectangular par m , it is a square.
(If two vertices of the sq. are to lie on the arc, and the other
two on the radii, see Ex. 3, p. 284.)
Page 200.
1. (i) Let O be the centre of the circle, OA a radius. With
centre A, radius AO, cut the O ce at B. Join AB. Then
A OAB is equilateral. Set off chords equal to AB round the
O ce . The resulting figure will be the hexagon required;
for /.AOB=6o°, or one-sixth of 360°.
(ii) Let Obe centre and OA a radius as before; draw OB at
right angles to OA. Bisect the /.AOB by OC meeting
the 0“ at C. Set off chords equal to AC round the circle.
The resulting figure will be the octagon required; for
L AOC = 45°, or one-eighth of 360°.
(iii) As in (i) describe the equilateral triangle OAB. Bisect
/.AOB by the line 00 meeting the ®“ at C. Set off
chords equal to AC round the circle. The resulting figure
will be the dodecagon required; for /.AOC = 30° = -jL of 360°.


2. (i) As in Ex. 1. (i) inscribe a regular hexagon in the given O ;
and draw the tangents at its angular points. Taking the
figure of Prob. 30 let the tangents at A and B meet in T,
those at B and C in R, and those at C and D in S.
Now A AOB, BOC are equal [Th. 43]; and OT, OR are their
• bisectors [Th. 47, Cor.] ; .-. z.TOB=z.ROB.
Also z.TBO = rt. z_=z.RßO.
Hence A s OBT, OBR are congruent \Th. 17]; .'. TB = BR;
that is RT = 2RB.
Similarly RS = 2RC.
But RB, RC are equal [Th. 47, Cor.]. .-. RT = RS.
Similarly every pair of consecutive sides of the circumscribed
hexagon are equal, and the figure is .•. equilateral.
Now, from quad 1 AOBT, since the u B, A are rt. U ;
.'. A ATB = supplement of aAOB ; [Th. 16]
= supplement of L BOC ; [Th. 43]
=A BRC.
Similarly every pair of consecutive angles of the figure are
equal. .". the circumscribed hexagon is regular.
(ii) Inscribe the regular octagon as in Ex. 1 (ii), and draw the
tangents at its vertices. The proof follows exactly as in
Ex. 2 (i).
3. (i) Let ABCDEF be the inscribed hexagon, and O the centre
of the ©. Then because AO =OB and Z.AOB = 60°, the
AAOB is equilateral [Th. 16] and .’. AB = 08. ,v each
side of hexagon = radius of the ©.
Hence A s FAB, FOB are congruent [Th. 7] and .'. equal in area.
Similarly A BCD = A BOD, and AFED=AFOD.
by addition, A BFD=half the area of the hexagon.
(ii) Since sum of z. s AOB, BOC, 000 = 180°, AOD is a st. line.
Also ABOF is a rhombus and AO bisects BF at rt.
[Ex. 4, p. 59.]
Let AO, BF meet in K.
Then BK=ißF=|ct; OK = JOA = |5.
But BK 2 + (5k 2 = OB 2 [TA. 29]; or, (|) V (*) 2 = ;
whence a 2 = 35 2 .


4. This can only be done approximately. Proceed as in Prob. 30;
making Z. AOB = 51-3° (i.e. slA°, to the nearest half degree).
Then Z-OBA=^(supp t of 51f°) = 64|°.
Z.ABC = 2 z_OBA = 128f°.
Page 201.
1. Draw any st. line AB = 2'o". On AB describe an equilateral
A AOB. With centre O, radius OA, describe a ©, and in
it set off chords BC, CD, DE, EF, FA each equal to AB.
Then ABCDEF is the req d hexagon, and the 0 is its cir-
cumscribed ©. From O draw OP perp. to AB. Then OP
is the radius of the in-©, for the circumcentre and in-
centre of a regular polygon coincide. [Prob. 31].
Diameter of circum-circle = 20A = 4 - 0".
Also OP 2 = OA 2 -AP 2 [Th. 29] = 2 2 -l 2 ; whence OP=v / 3 in.
.". diameter of in-circle = 2V.3 = 3'46".
2. In the Fig. of Prob. 30, let the tangents at A and B cut at P.
Join OP, bisecting AB at rt. angles at X [Ex. 7. p. 177].
It may be shewn that L APX = 60°, and L PAX = 30°;
and hence that PX=|AP; similarly AP=JPO.
/. PO = 4PX, and OX = 3PX.
Now area of A OAe=4. AB .OX= J. AB x 3PX.
And fig. OAPB=4 .AB . OP=|. AB x 4PX.
.-. A OAB = J fig. OAPB.
, by addition, the in-hexagon = | of circum-hexagon.
In the numerical example, OA =AB= 10 cm., and AX = 5 cm.
Also OX=WOA 2 —AX 2 =W7S = sv/3 cm.
Now area of in-hexagon =6A OAB=3. AB .OX

3. B + C + A = 2A + 2A+A = 180°;
/. 5A = 180°; A = 36°.
BC subtends an angle of 36° at;the circumference, and
one of 72° at the centre. But the angle subtended at the
centre by the side of an inscribed regular pentagon is
360°
—p—=72°. ;. BC is the side of a regular pentagon in-
o
scribed in the circle.
4. (i) Proceed as in Ez. 1.
From O draw OP perp. to AB. Then OB=AB = 2BP.
And OP 2 = OB 2 - BP 2 =48P 2 BP 2 =38P 2 .
.'. OP=V3. BP=2\/3 cm.
Now area of hexagon =6 A OAB=3. AB. 0P=24v , 3 sq. cm.
= 41 - 57 sq. cm.
(ii) Let AB be the given line of 4 cm. Bisect AB at rt. angles
by PQ, cutting AB at X.
From XP cut off XC equal to XA. From CP cut off CO equal
to CA. With centre O, radius OA, draw a 0 ; and step off
chords each equal to AB round the O ce .
Join OA, 08, AC; and prove that /.ACX = 45°; hence from
ACO A, shew that L COA = 22ts°. .-. central LAO B = 45°.
By measurement, OX = 4 - 8 cm., approx.
Now area of octagon = BAAOB = 4. AB. OX

The area=irr 2 =fl-x(l-8) 2 = 3’24= 10'18 sq. cm.
4. Let abe the side of the square ; and r the radius of the ©.
Then since the diagonal of the square is a diameter of the

Now area of square = a 2 =2r 2 . Area of circle = irr 2 .

.". side of square=sxs/3 - 14159=5 xl - 77"i..=8 - 85"... =B‘9",
to nearest tenth of an inch.
9. Let rbe the radius of the larger 0 in inches, and therefore
(r —1) that of the smaller.
Then area of the ring =ir {r 2 —(r I) 2 } sq. in. =22 sq. in.
, .’. = 22; whence r— 4.
.-. the radii are 4'o" and 3'o" respectively.
10. As in Ex. 2, p. 198, the radius of the circum-circle is double
that of the in-circle. Denote them by 2r, r respectively.
Then difference between the areas of the two O’
= tt. 4r 2 -x.r 2 =37rr 2 .
Now if ABC be the A, O the common centre of the two O”,
and OD the perp. from O to BC, we have OB 2 OD 2 =BD 2 ;
or 4r 2 -r 2 =4, whence 3r 2 =4.
diff. between the two areas=4w sq. in.
= 12-57 sq. in.

the sum and difference of the two pairs of radii.

1. Let AB, CD be the two par 1 lines cut by PQ.
Bisect the /- B APQ, CQP by lines which meet at O. Draw
OX, OY, OZ perp. to AB, CD, PQ.
Then the A B XPO, ZPO are identically equal [ Th. 17].
.'. OX = OZ. Similarly OZ = OY. And since the UatX, Y, Z
are rt. angles, a © described from centre O with radius
OX touches the given lines at X, Y, Z.
A second O is obtained by bisecting the L 8 BPQ, DQR
Again since OX, OY are perp. to par 1 lines, they may be shewn
to be in the same st. line.
Hence the diam. of each © is the perp. distance between the
given par 15 ; the © 8 are equal.
2 Let ABC, DEF be the two A 8 having BC = EF, and the L BAC
= L EDF. Let O, O' be the centres of their circum-circles.
Join 08, OC, O'E, O'F.
Then L BOC=2 L BAC= 2I EDF =L EO'F. [ Th. 38.]
the isosceles A 8 BOC, EO'F have their vertical U equal;
.'. their remaining angles are equal [Th. 16.] ; and BC = EF;
.■. the A” are congruent [Th. 17.] ; and the radii 08, O'E
are equal.
3. Join. BS, CS.
Then since SA=SB, /.SAB=/_SBA.
And since SA = SC, .'. = Z-SCA.
But since lis in AS, L SAB— /. SAC.
Z.SBA=Z.SCA.
Hence the A 8 BAS, CAS may be shewn to be congruent
[Th. 17].
AB=AC.
4. Let ABC be the A, rt.-angled at C, and let the inscribed ©
touch the sides BC, CA, AB at D, E, F ; and let I be its
centre.
Join ID, lE. Then clearly the fig. 1C is a square.
Hence the diam. of inscribed 0 = DC + CE.
And since BCA is a rt. angle, the diam. of the circum. © =BA
[Th. 41.]
= BF+AF=BD +AE [Th. 47. Cor.}
:. the sum of the diams. =DC+ CE + BD+AE =BC +AC.


5. Disto be opp. to A, Eto B, and Fto C.
In the A AFE, AF=AE [ Th. 47, Cor.].
:. <iAFE=z.AEF=9O°--. [7%. 16-3
But Z.AFE=/_ EDF. [Th. 49.] .-. = 90°---
6. Join 81, Blj, also Cl, Clj.
Then 81, 81, are respectively the internal and external
bisectors of the L ABC,
- .'. the L IBIj is a rt. angle [Ex. 6, p. 13].
Similarly the L I Cl L is a rt. angle.
the four points I, B, l u C are concyclic. [7%. 41.]
7. Take the Figure of p. 194.
Then since AF=AE [Th. 47, Cor.], the diff. of AC and AB = the
diff. of EC and FB, that is the diff. of CD and DB.
8. [ln the Figure taken AB is greater than AC.]
Since the Z.ASB is twice the Z.ACB ; [Th. 38.]
/. SAB = 90° ~C, [Th. 16.]
.-.
=iA —(9o° —C)
— + + C
=4c-*a
Again, as above, L SAB = 90° - C,
and L DAB = 90° - B ;
.'. L DAB=Z. DAB - /.SAB
=C —B = 2z.SAI.
9. Let P, Q, R, Sbe the centres of the 0 s about the A ! in the
order named.
Then clearly SR bisects DO at rt. angles [7VoS. 25].
Similarly PQ bisects OB at rt. angles.
SR is par 1 to PQ. Thus also SP is par 1 to RQ ;
SPQR is a par m .


10. Join 80, OC.
Since = Z.CAO, arc BO=arc OC [Th. 42],
.'. chord BO = chord OC. \Tk. 45.]
Again the ext. L. 810 =A. IAB +z. IBA =JA +
Also the z.IBO=/.OBC + Z.IBC=aOAC + /.IBC [Th. 39]
=iA+jß.
.-. L 810 =z. 180, .’. OI =OB = OC.
.'. O is the centre of the © about BIG.
11. Let AB be the given base. Draw PQ par 1 to AB at a distance
from it equal to the given altitude.
Describe O s from centres A and B with radius equal to the
given radius of circum. © ; let these ©’ intersect at O, on
the same side of AB as PQ From centre O with radius
OA describe a © cutting PQ at C or O'. Then either of
the A S ABC, ABC' satisfies the required conditions.
12. AB, BC, CA pass through F, D, E respectively. [Th. 48.]
At F, E, D draw the common tangents FP, EQ, DR to the
pairs of © s which touch at those points.
Then if these 3 lines are not concurrent, let FP, EQ, meet in
O, and from O draw OK perp. to BC.
Then since AO 2 OB 2 =AF 2 - FB 2 [Ex. 2, p. 193.]
and AO 2 —OC 2 =AE 2 —EC 2 ;
we have, by subtraction,
OC 2 OB 2 = EC 2 - FB 2 ;
=CD 2 DB 2 . [Th. 47, Cor.]
But OC 2 -OB 2 = CK 2 - KB 2 [Ex. 2, p. 123.]
CD 2 DB 2 =GK 2 KB 2
.-. (CD + DB)(CD - DB) = (CK + KB)(CK - KB).
But CD + DB = CK + KB;
.-. CD -DB = CK- KB ;
.•., by addition, 2CD = 2CK ; whence D and K coincide.
Thus the three tangents meet in O.
.-. OD = OF, and OF =OE [Th. 47, Cor.] ;
/. a © with centre O and radius OD passes through D, E, F
and touches the sides of the A ABC at those points ; for
Z-’OFB, ODC, OEA are rt. U.
:. the ©DEF is the in-© of A ABC and the circum-©
of A DEF.

1. Let the perps. from A and Bon BC and AC meet those sides
at D and E and intersect in O : and let AD meet the Circum-
cirole in G. Join BG.
Then in the A s OEA, ODB,
because L OEA=Z, ODB, each being a rt. angle ;
and l EGA =L DQB ; [Th. 3]
remaining L EAO = remaining L DBG. [Th. 16.]
But Z.CAG = Z.CBG ; [Th. 39]
.'. L DBO=Z. DBG.
Hence the A' DBG, DBG are congruent. [Th. 17.]
DO = DG.
2. In the Fig. of p. 208, produce ED to X.
It has been shewn that L EDC=a. FDB [p. 208. 11. for.]
Butz.EDC=Z.BDX [Th. 3] ; .-. aFDB=z.BDX.
That is, /the ext. L FDX is bisected by BD ; and so on for the
other L. " of the pedal A.
The latter part of the proposition may be solved in a similar
manner.
3. With the Fig. of p. 208, since the Z." AFO, AEG are rt. angles
{hyp.), :. the four points A, F, O, E are concyclic.
.'. the U FAE, FOE together = two rt. angles [Th. 40].
That is, the L? BAG, BOG together = two rt. angles [Th. 3].
4. With the Fig. of p. 208, consider the A OBC.
Here BF is the perp. from B on the opp. side CO produced ;
and CE is the perp. from Con the opp. side BO produced.
Now BF and CE intersect in A ; and AO produced is perp. to
BC. [p. 207,1.] Hence Ais the orthoeentre of the A OBC.
5. Consider the O 8 circumscribed about the A B ABC, OBC; and
let Xbe any point on the O oe of the 0 BOC, on the side
of BC remote from O.
Then the z. 8 BOC, BXC are supplementary [Th. 40],
and the z. B BOC, BAC are supplementary [Ex. 3] ;
.-. l BXC L BAC.
Hence the segments BAC, BXC stand on the same base, and
contain equal angles, the circles of which these segments
are parts are equal [Ex. 2, p. 206].


6. Consider the A FAB. BD is perp. to the side AF [ Th. 41],
and AE is perp. to BF for the same reason :
G, their point of, intersection, is the orthocentre of the
A AFB.
.'. FG (produced, if necessary) is perp. to AB [p. 207, I.].
7. Here z.BCK=/_BAK, in same segment
= corap* of Z.AKB [Th. 41]
=comp* of Z_ ACB [Th. 39]
[Th. 16J.
Similarly LKBC = L BCO ;
.'. BO is par 1 to KC, and BK par 1 to OC [Th. 13],
8. With the figure of the last exercise, since BOCK is a par m ,
the diagonals bisect one another [Th. 21, Cor. hi.].
That is, KO passes through the middle point of BC.
Hence the st. line joining O to the middle point of BC,
passes through K.
9. Erom Ex. 8, we see that the st. line joining the orthocentre
to the middle point of the base passes through an extremity
of the diam r drawn from A.
.'. Z.APQ is a rt. angle [Th. 41] ; and since AP is also perp. to
BC, .V PC is par 1 to BC [Th. 13].
10. Let SX be the perp. drawn from S the centre of the circum- O
on BC. Then by Ex. 8, AS and OX meet the O ce at the
same point Q. And SX, passing through the middle point
of AQ, is par 1 to AO; SX is half of AO [Exx. 1,3., p. 64],
11. Let Sbe the centre of the © circumscribed about the A ABC,
and A', B', C' the centres of the O s about the A s OBC,
OCA, OAB.
Then it follows from Ex. 5 that BSCA' is a rhombus, and
SA' and BC bisect one another at rt. angles. Also SB'
and AC.
Hence, by Ex. 10, AO=A'S. Similarly OB = SB'.
Again SA' and AO are par 1 , for both are perp. to BC.
Similarly SB' and BO are par 1 . L AOB=/_ A'SB'.
A'B' =AB [Th. 4], Similarly B'C' =BC and C'A' = CA.
It may be noticed that in the A s ABC, A'BC' the orthocentre
of each is the circumcentre of the other.


12. Let Abe the vertex, O the orthocentre, and S the centre of
the circum-O.
From centre S with radius SA describe a O ; this is the circum-
circle of the required A.
Join AO and produce it to meet the O ce at G.
Bisect OG at D, and draw the chord BC perp. to AG. Join
AB, AC. Then ABC shall be the required A. Proof
follows from Ex. 1.
Page 211.
1. Let BC be the given base, and BAG any A of the system,
having the vertical L BAC constant in magnitude, but not
fixed in position. Let the bisectors of the exterior angles
at B and C intersect at Ij.
Then I BC=-(180°-B)=90°-|.
Similarly, L IjCB = 90° —5.
But in A bBC,
/Ll 1 + I BC + Al I CB = 180° [Th. 16].
B C A
Hence Lb= + 2=9o° constant.
.’. since the base BC is fixed, the locus of l t is the arc of a
segment of a circle [Th. 39, Converse].
Note. The locus of I in IY. p. 210 and the locus of Ij are
conjugate arcs of the same O.
2. Let the bisectors meet at X.
Then Z.PAB, QBA together=two rt. angles [Th. 14].
Z.XAB, XBA together=one rt. angle [Hyp.].
:. Z.AXB is a rt. angle [Th. 16],
And since AB is' fixed, the locus of X is a circle on AB as
diameter [Ex. 1, p. 165].
3. Let Abe the fixed point, C the centre of the O, and APQ any
chord through A, meeting the O* at P, Q. Let Xbe the
middle point of PQ. Then CX is perp. to PQ [Th. 31].
That is, the z. AXC is a rt. angle, and since AC is a fixed base,
the point X lies on the 0“ of a O on AC as diam.
[Ex. 1, p. 165.]


(i) If A is external, the locus is that part of the O on AC
which is intercepted within the given O.
(ii) If Ais on the O ce , the locus is a complete O described
on the radius AC as diam., and having internal contact
with the given ©.
(iii) If A is internal, the locus is a complete 0 falling within
the given 'O.
4. Let Abe the given point, and B the common centre of the
concentric ©“. Let Pbe the point of contact of a tangent
from Ato any one of these 08.O 8 . Then APB is a rt. angle
[Th. 46].
And since A and B are fixed points, the locus is a circle on
AB as diam. [Ex. 1, p. 165.]
5. Let A, B be the fixed points on the 0“, PQ the arc of
constant length but variable position. Let AP, BQ inter-
sect at X. To find the locus of X. [ln the fig. taken
AP, BQ intersect when produced outside the ©.] Join PB.
Then z.APB=Z.AXB+z. PBX [Th. 16],
or L X =z.APB L PBQ.
But these are constant angles, being subtended by the con-
stant arcs AB and PQ [Th. 39] ; the lX is constant.
.•. the locus is the arc of a segment described on AB [Th. 39,
Conv.l-
6. Let PA, QB intersect at X. Join PB. [ln the fig. taken PQ
and AB do not intersect within the circle, and X is also
external].
Then L X is the diff. of L‘ PBQ, XPB [Th. 16],
But L PBQ is constant, being a rt. angle [Th. 41],
Also L XPB is constant, being subtended by the fixed arc AB.
/. the LX is constant; and since the points A, B are fixed,
the locus of X is the arc of a segment [Th. 39, C<mv.~\.
When X is internal, the L X is supplementary to the value
found above, and the conjugate segment of the locus is
obtained.
7. It follows that AP=AC, .". Z. APC=<l ACP.
But L BAC=sum of U APC, AGP [Th. 16].
/. L BAG is double of L APC.
Or, L BPC is half of l BAG, and is therefore constant.
Then, since BC is fixed, the locus of P is the arc of a segment
on BC [Th. 39, Com).].


8. The intersection of the diagonals is X, the middle point of
BC [Th. 21, Cor. hi]. Join Xto D, the middle point of AB.
Then DX is par 1 to AC [Ex. 2, p. 64].
.-. z.DXB = 14],
But /.ACB is constant [ Th. 39],
.’. L DXB is constant, and D, B are fixed points.
.'. the locus of X is the arc of a O.
9. ' Let Abe the point of intersection of the rulers.
Then PXQA is a rectangle.
.'. AX = PQ, which is constant; and the point A is fixed.
Hence the locus of X is the quadrant of a circle described
from the centre. A with radius PQ.
10. [Take the figure in which PA and PB must both be produced
to meet the second O ce .] Let AY, BX intersect at R.
Then the locus of R is required.
Now L ARB = sum of u RBY, RYB [Th. 16]
= sum of L 8 at P, X, Y [Th. 16] ;
and 'these are all constant, being subtended by fixed arcs.
.'. /.ARB is constant; and since the points A and B are fixed,
the locus is part of a circle. It PA or PB cuts the O™
without being produced, the Z.ARB = the supplement of
the sum of the L? P, X, Y. Hence the rest of the circle
is obtained.
11. Let PH and KQ intersect at X. Required the locus of X.
From the A PXQ it will be seen by Theor. 16 that the /.X
=the diff. of the L? HPA, AQK; both of which are
constant, since they stand on the fixed arcs HA, AK.
And since H, K are fixed points, the locus of X is part of a ©.
If P and Q are on the same side of A, the value of the l X is
supplementary to that found above, and the rest of the
O is obtained.

Then since the U PFB, PDB are rt. angles, the pts. P, F, B, D
are concyclic.

3. Draw PD, PD', PE, PF perp. respectively to the four lines
BC, B'C', ACC', ABB'.
Then since P is on the circum-circle of the A ABC, .'. the
points E, F, D are collinear [Y. p. 212],
And since P is on the circum-circle of the A AB'C',
.•. the points E, F, D' are collinear.
Hence D and D' both lie on the st. line through E and F.
4. Let ABC be the A, P the given point on the circumscribed 0.
Let PF, PD be the perps. on AB, BC ; so that FD produced is
the pedal of P; Draw AH perp. to BC, and produce it to
meet the 0“ at G. Take HO equal to HG. Then Ois
the orthocentre [Ex. 1, p. 209].
Let OP meet the pedal of Pat X. Then shall OX=XP.

at K, and BC (or BC produced) at 1_ Join OL.
[The proof given below is for an acute-angled triangle. Pis
taken in the arc BG. F falls within AB, and PG meets

3. Take the figure of p. 214.
Since 81, Blj are respectively the internal and external bisectors
of the /.ABC ; .'. L IBIj is a rt. angle.
So also the L ICIj is a rt. angle : .'. the points I, B, h, C are
concyclic.
.'. /. Bljl =/.BCI =]jC ; and/.Cljl =/.CBI = JB. [Th. 39.]
Hence by addition the L BIjC^B+IC
= comp t of|A. [Th. 16.]
That is, the L BI,C is constant: and the base BC is fixed; .'. the
locus is the arc of a segment. l


4. Given the base BC and the vert, angle, the vertex A must lie
on the arc of a certain segment described on BC as base.
That is, the three points A, B, C lie, for all positions of A,
on a fixed circle ; for if an arc. of a circle is fixed, the
whole circle is fixed [ Th. 32]. the centre is fixed.
5. 1 Take the figure of p. 214. Required the locus of 12.l 2 .
Since the z. a ICI 2 , IAI 2 are rt. angles,
.‘. the points I, C, 12,l 2 , A are concyclic.
.'. 2 C = ’ [Th. 39.]
Hence the locus of l 2 is the arc of a segment on BC as base,
capable of containing an angle equal to |A.
6. On the base BC describe a segment containing one rt. angle + \
the given angle X ; then the centre of the inscribed © is on
this arc [IV., p. 210].
At D, the given point in BC, draw a line perp. to BC cutting
the arc at I. Then I must be the centre of the inscribed ©,
and ID is its radius.
From centre I, with radius ID, draw the inscribed ©, to which
draw tangents from B and C. If these tangents produced
meet at A, then ABC is the required triangle.
Prove by a method converse to IV, p. 210 that the
L BAG=the given angle X.
7. On BC the given base describe a> segment containing one rt.
angle —\ the given angle [Ex. 3], then the centre of the
escribed © must be on this arc. From this point proceed
as in the last Example.
8. Now I and b lie on the bisector of the L BAG.

a circle : and let the points of contact be D, E, F (D being
opp. to A, &c.).
Then AE=AF, BD = BF, and CE=CD [Th. 47, Gor.\
Hence 0 s described from the centres A, B, C, with radii
AF, BD, CE will clearly satisfy the given conditions.
There will be four solutions in all; for solutions may
also be obtained from the three escribed os.0 s .
11. 12. It has been proved in (v), p. 214, that if I, h, 12,l 2 , l 3 are
the centres of the inscribed and escribed circles of the
A ABC, each of these four points is the orthocentre of
the triangle formed by the other three, and that the
original A ABC is the pedal triangle.
Hence given any three of the points I, l x , 12,l 2 , 13,l 3 , we have only
to draw the pedal triangle of the triangle so formed.
13. Let AX, AY determine the given vert. L. Mark off AE,, AFj
each equal to half the given perimeter : and describe a
circle to touch AX, AY at Ej and Fi. This is an escribed ©
of the required triangle.
As in Ex. 6, p. 189 describe a 0, with radius equal to the
given radius, to touch AX, AY. This is the in-circle.
Then if either of the transverse common tangents of these
two O" be drawn, meeting AX, AY in B and C, the A ABC
will satisfy the required conditions.
14. Draw the inscribed O as in the last Example ; and from
the given vertex as centre, with the given altitude as
radius, describe a circle. Then draw either of the direct
common tangents to the two 0 s


15. Take the figure of p. 214.
Since Bl and 81, are the internal and external bisectors of
the L ABC, thezJßl, is a rt. angle.
Similarly, the Z.ICI, is a rt. angle. 11, is the diameter of
the O about IBI,C. But the O ce of the 0 about the
A ABC bisects 11, [Ex. 8, p. 215]: that is, the centre of
the O about BIC lies on the O ce of the O about ABC.
Page 218.
1. Take the figure of p. 218.
If the base and vert. L are given, then the circura-0 is fixed
in position and magnitude \Th. 39] ; hence the radius of
the nine-points © (being half that of the oircum-O) is
given : that is, XN is constant. But X is a fixed point;
.'. the locus of N is a O, of which X is the centre.
2. For by Ex. 4, p. 209, each of the A 8 ABC, AOB, BOC, COA
have the same pedal triangle, and therefore the same nine-
points O, for the nine-points © circumscribes the pedal
triangle.
3. For by Ex. (v), p. 214, the A ABC is the pedal triangle of
each of the four triangles formed by joining three of the
points I, l„ 12,l 2 , 13.l 3 .
4. For, in the figure of p. 218, both O and S are fixed : .'. N, the
middle point of SO is fixed.
t
And since the circum-0 is given, .'. the radius of the nine-
points ois given [(ii), p. 217]. Hence the nine-points ©
is fully determined.
5. Take the figure of p. 208.
Let BC be the fixed base of the A ABC, having its vert, l BAC
constant in magnitude. Then the circum-0 is fixed in
position and magnitude [Ex. 4, p. 215], Hence the ©
about the pedal A DEF is fixed in magnitude, for its radius
is half that of the oircum-O [p. 217].
Now the L FDE at the O ce is constant, for it is the supp 4 of
twice the vert. L A [II., p. 208, Cor.\ the chord FE is of
constant length [ Th . 42, 45].


6. Take the Fig. of p. 214.
Now the base BC is given, and the vert. L BAG is constant,
.". the eircum-O is fixed in magnitude and position.
But ABC is the pedal A of the AlJglj [(v), p. 214],
the circum-O of the A ABC is the nine-points © of 1,1,1 3 .
Hence if Alj, and l 2 l 3 cut the © about ABC at X and Y, these
are the middle points respectively of 11,, and l 2 l 3
[YIIL, p. 216].
But since XAY is a rt. L [Ex. 6, p. 13], XY is a diam., and
its middle point N is the centre of the O about ABC, and is
a fixed point.
But X is a fixed point (the middle point of the arc BC, since
Z.BAX=Z.CAX), .-. Yis a fixed point.
Draw YS perp. to l 2 l 3 meeting IN produced at S.
Then Sis the centre of the © about I, l 2 1 3 , for this centre must
lie both in YS and IN produced [p. 217].
AndSN = NI: aIsoYN=XN (proved), and L SNY = vert. opp.
Z.XNI;
/. SY =IX [Th. 4]=| 11, (proved above).
But llj is a diam. of the © about the A BIC ; and this is a
fixed ©, for the base and vert. L are constant [IV.,
p. 210], Hence SY is constant; and as Y has been shewn
to be a fixed point, the locus of S is a © about Y as centre.

and AB . XB=XB 2 +AX . XB ; [Th. 50, Cor. ii.]
AB 2 =AX 2 +XB 2 +2AX.XB.


2. AY. YB = XY 2 -AX 2 . [Th. 53, Cor,]
Also AY .YB = 8AX 2 . [Zfyp.]
XY?=9AX 2 ; whence XY = 3AX.
AY = 4AX = 2AB.
3. If the given lines are unequal, they can be placed as AX, XB in
the Fig. of Theor. 52. Completing the Fig. we see that sum
of sqq. on AX, XB exceeds the sum of the rects. BG, DG
by the fig. AC : and that this excess can never vanish since
the lines are by hypothesis unequal. Also each of the rects.
BG and DG is contained by the two given lines. Hence
the theorem follows.
If the given lines are equal, it is easily seen that the sum of
the squares is equal to the sum of the two rects.
From the formula (a - J) 2 =a 2 +6 2 - 2ab we have, by trans-
position, a? + b t =2ab +(a 6) 2 . Now when a and b are
unequal, (a b ) 2 is necessarily positive, and a 2 + 6 2 > 2 ab.
When a=b, (a-hf =O, and .'. a? + b 2 =2ab.
Thus a 2 + b 2 is never less than 2 ab.
4. Substituting as required, we obtain xy= ’
This can be enunciated thus ;
Any rectangle is equal to the excess of the square on half the
sum of its length and breadth over the square on half the
difference of its length and breadth.
5. (i) We have AY. YB=AX 2 —XY 2 \Th. 53, Cor.].
Since AX is of constant length, AX 2 —XY 2 diminishes as XY
increases, that is, as Y moves away from X.
(ii) Let AY = a units and YB = b units. Then 7\B =a+ 6.
Hence AX=—, and .-. XY = AY-AX=—.
zL tL
As Y moves along AB the values of a , b change, but their sum
is constant. Now from the given formula, remembering
that is constant, we see that ab diminishes as —~
increases ; that is, AY. YB diminishes as XY increases, or
as Y moves away from X.
6. (ii) AY 2 +YB 2 =AB 2 +2AY. YB. [Th. 52.]
=4AX 2 +2 (XY+AX)(XY - AX)
= 4AX 2 + 2(XY 2 - AX 2 ) [Th. 53.]
= 2AX 2 + 2XY 2


7. Take X the middle point of AB. Then, by Ex. 6 (i),
A Y 2 +Y 82=2B 2 =2 AX 2 +2X Y 2.
As Y moves from A to X, the value of XY decreases from AX
to zero, and AY 2 +YB 2 decreases from 4AX 2 to 2AX 2 .
As Y moves from X to B, the value of XY increases from zero
to XB, which is equal to AX. Hence AY 2 + YB 2 increases
from 2AX 2 to 4AX 2 .
8. Let ABC be a A rt. angled at B, and let BD be drawn perp.
to AC.
Then AC 2 =AD 2 + DC 2 +2AD . DC. [Th. 61.]
But AC 2 =AB 2 +BC 2 [Th. 29.]
=AD 2 +BD 2 +DC 2 +BD 2 . [Th. 29.]
.-. AD 2 +DC 2 +28D 2 =AD 2 +DC 2 +2AD. DC,
or BD 2 =AD. DC.
9. Let ABC be an isosceles A, having its vertex at A; and let
AY be drawn to any pt. Y in BC, or BC produced.
Draw AP perp. to BC. Then, by Theor. 17, BP=PC.
Thus BY, YC are the sum and difference of PY and PC.
(i) When Y is an internal point.
We have PC 2 - PY 2 = BY. YC. [Th. 53.]
.-. (AP 2 + PC 2 ) -(AP 2 + PY 2 )=BY. YC ;
AC 2 - AY 2 = BY. YC. [Th. 29.]
Hence AC 2 =AY 2 +BY.YC.
(ii) When Y is in BC produced.
In this case PY 2 - PC 2 = BY. YC. [Th. 53.]
Proceeding's in (i) we obtain
AY 2 - AC 2 = BY. YC.
/. AC 2 .=AY 2 - BY. YC.

1, Prom the A APB, AP 2 + BP 2 =2A0 2 +20P 2 . [ Th. 56.]
Here AOi=4 cm., OP=5 cm. ; whence AP 2 + PB 2 =82 sq. cm.
2- Substituting the lengths of AB, AC, BX in the relation

3. Let Pbe the vertex and O the middle point of the base ;
then, by Theor. 56, 122 = 2(OP 2 + 25). \Th. 56.]
.-. 20P 2 =72, whence OP= 6 cm.
.•. P lies on a circle of radius 6 cm. whose centre is at the
mid-pt. of the base.
4. Let ABCD be the par m ; and let the diags. meet at O.
Then O is the middle point of AC and BD.
Then from A ABC, AB 2 + BC 2 =2A0 2 +20B 2 . [ Th. 56.]
Also, from A CDA, CD 2 + DA 2 =20C 2 + 20D 2 .
By addition, remembering that AO = OC and OB=OD,
AB 2 + BC 2 +C D 2 + DA 2 = 4A0 2 +40B 2
=AC 2 +BD 2 . [sr. 1, p. 225.]
By the above, since the sum of the squares on the 4 sides
=36 sq. in.; .". the sum of the squares on the diagonals
= 36 sq. in.
sq. on longer diagonal =27 sq. in.; .-. length of that
diagonal is 5 - 20".
5. Let ABCD be the quad 1 , and P, Q, R, S, the middle points of
the sides AB, BC, CD, DA.
Then PCJRS is a par™ [Ex. 7, p. 64.]
and AC=2PQ, also BD=2BP. [Ex. 3, p. 64.]
AC 2 + BD 2 = 4PQ 2 + 4SP 2
= 2 {PQ 2 + SR 2 +SP 2 +QR 2 }
= 2{PR 2 +SQ 2 }. [Ex. 4.]
6. (i) Let ABCD be the rect., and O the given point within it.
Let the diagonals meet at P. Then AC=BD [Th. 4];
and the diags. bisect one another ; .-. AP=BP.
Then from A ACC, OA 2 + OC 2 =2[AP 2 +OP 2 ] ; [Th. 56.]
and from ABCD, OB 2 + OD 2 = 2[BP 2 + OP 2 ];
OA 2 + OC 2 =OB 2 +OD 2 .
(ii) Since CA 2 + 0C 2 =20P 2 + 2AP 2 , and OA 2 + OC 2 =2lJ;
20P 2 + 2AP 2 = 21i; so that 20P 2 =2lJ-2AP 2 .
Now AC 2 = AB 2 + BC 2 =36+ 6-25 = 42-25;
and AC 2 =4AP 2 ; .-. 2AP 2 =21T25.
But 20P 2 = 21-25 - 2AP 2 = 21-25 - 21-125 = 0T25.
.-. OP 2 =o-0625; hence OP=O-25".


7. Let ABCD be the quad 1 , and X, Y the middle points of BD.
AC. Join YB, YX, YD.
Then from the A ABC, AB 2 + BC 2 =2AY 2 + 2BY 2 ; [ Th. 56.]
also from the A ADC, AD 2 +DC 2 =2AY 2 +2DY 2 .
.'. AB 2 + BC 2 +AD 2 + DC 2 =4AY 2 +2(8Y 2 + DY 2 )
=AC 2 + 4(DX 2 +XY 2 ) [Th. 56.]
=AC 2 4- BD 2 + 4XY 2 .
8. We have AB 2 =AC 2 + BC 2 - 2AC. CE. [Th. 55.]
Also AC 2 =AB 2 + BC 2 - 2AB . BF.
By addition AB 2 +AC 2 =AB 2 +AC 2 + 2BC 2 - 2AB. BF - 2AC. CE,
whence AB.BF + AC.CE = BC 2 .
9. Let AX, BY, CZ be the medians of the A ABC.
Then AB 2 +AC 2 =2AX 2 +28X 2 , [Th. 56.]
and AB 2 + BC 2 = 2BY 2 + 2CY 2 ,
also BC 2 +AC 2 =2CZ 2 +2A2 2 .
By addition
2AB 2 + 2BC 2 +2AC 2 =2 (AX 2 + BY 2 +CZ 2 ) + 2BX 2 +2C Y 2 +2AZ 2 ;
.-. 4AB 2 +48C 2 + 4AC 2 =4 (AX 2 + BY 2 +CZ 2 ) + 4BX 2 +4CY 2 +4AZ 2
= 4 (AX 2 +BY 2 + CZ 2 ) + BC 2 + AC 2 + AB 2 .
Hence 3 [AB 2 +BC 2 +AC 2 ] =4 [AX 2 +B Y 2 +CZ 2 ].
10. Let AX, BY, CZ be the medians, intersecting at O.
Then OA=2OX, OB=2OY, OC=2O2[III. p. 97, Cor.],
and from the A BOC, OB 2 +OC 2 =28X 2 +20X 2 .
Again from A. COA, OC 2 +OA 2 = 2CY 2 +20Y 2 ,
also from AAOB, OA 2 + OB 2 =2AZ 2 +20Z 2 .
by addition
20A 2 +20B 2 +20C 2 =28X 2 +2CY 2 +2AZ 2 + 20X 2 +20Y 2 +20Z 2 ,
and doubling these equals, we have
40A 2 +40B 2 +40C 2 =48X 2 +4C Y 2 + 4AZ 2 + 40X 2 +40Y 2 +40Z 2
= BC 2 +CA 2 +AB 2 + OA 2 + OB 2 + OC 2 .
Hence 3[OA 2 +OB 2 + OC 2 ] =BC 2 + CA 2 +AB 2 .
11. Theorem 56 is true however close the vertex Cis to the base
AB on either side of it. We conclude that it is therefore
also true in the intermediate position when C actually lies
at Y on AB.
Thus the line AB bisected at X and divided at Y may be
regarded as a A AYB with its base AB bisected at X.
Hence AY 2 +YB 2 =2AX 2 +2XY 2 .

10. Let PK, PT be the two tangents. Then by Ex. 7, p. 177 the

But, since AP. AQ=AX . AR, it can be shewn, as in Ex. 6, that
P, X, R, Q are concyclic. Hence z.AQR=iIPXR [Ex. 5,

Also NR .RM=PR . RQ ; [ Th . 57.]
that is, A. (2r A) =c 2.
Substituting c=l2, and h— B, we obtain r=l3.
2. (i) Put A = 18, r= 2s in the formula of Ex. 1.
Then c 2 =lB x 32 ; whence c= 24.
Hence the span, measured by 2c, is 48 feet.
(ii) Putting A = 10, r=2s in the formula, we obtain c = 20.
Thus the new span is 40 ft., and the reduction is 8 ft.
3. Substituting the given values we obtain A(34-A)=64.
Hence A 2 —34A+64=o, whence A = 2 or 32.
Thus the height of the arc is either 2 cm. or 32 cm., the first
result referring to the minor and the second result to the
major of the two arcs cut off by the chord.

But XA. XB=XT 2 ; [Th. 58.]

8. Let AE, DF meet at Pon the line of centres [Ex. 8, p. 187], and
let the line of centres meet BC at O. Then Ois the mid-
pt. of BC (111. p. 143).
By Ex. 7, p. 187, AE =DF ; and by Ex. 5, p. 236, G and H are
the mid-pts. of AE, DF: thus EG=FH and .". PG?=PH

3. A convenient rectangle is one whose length = 2 - 5" and whose
breadth = I's". Each side of the square must be -JZ'Hb in.,
or 1-94".
4. Let ABC be the equilateral A, AD the perp. from Aon BC.
Through A, C draw AK, CK par 1 to BC, AD respectively.
Then ADCK is the req d rect. Now proceed as in Prob. 32.
5. Apply Probs. 17 and 32.


6. See Fig. and Construction of 1., p. 244. Take AB=9 cm. and
DE=4 cm.
Here AX +XB=AB = 9, and AX .XB = DE 2 =l6 ;
if then we denote the lengths of AX, XB by x and y, we
have the two equations x+y =Q, xy = 16.
Now, by measurement, AX = 6'6 cm., XB = 2 - 4 cm.
Hence #=6 - 6, y 2'4 is a solution of the given equations.
7. In the Fig. on p. 244 take AB = 4 - 0" and DE = P 3".
Then by measurement, AX=3 - 52" and XB=o - 48". But OT"
represents 1 unit.
.'. if AX =4', XB=y we have x=3s'2, y=4 - 8.
8. Draw AB = 7'2 cm.; at B set up BF perp. to AB and=s'o cm.;
join AF, and draw FE at rt. U to AF meeting AB produced
in E. Then by Theor. 41 the semicircle on AE passes
through F ; .'. as in Prob. 32
rect. AB. BE = BF 2 =25 sq. cm.
By measurement BE = 3 - 5 cm.
9. See Fig. and Constr. of 11, p. 245. Take AB=B cm., BF=6 cm.
Now AX XB=AB=B cm.
and AX. XB = BF 2 =36 sq. cm.
.'. the no. of cm. in AX, XB, viz. 11'2 and 32, give the solution
of the equations x-y = S, xy = Z 6.
10. Draw a line AB 10 cm. in length. On AB describe a semi-
circle. At B set up BK perp. to AB and 2'5 cm. in length.
Through K draw KP par 1 to AB to meet the O oe at P.
Join AP, PB. From P draw PX perp. to AB.
Then AP 2 +PB 2 = AB 2 [Tk. 41 and 29] = 100 ;
and AP. PB =2 A APB (since L APB = 90°)= PX .AB = 25.
the- values of x and y are given by the numbers of cm. in
AP, PB, which are found by measurement to be, 9 - 6 and
2 - 6 respectively.

1. Use the Construction of Prob. 33.
Denote the length of the greater segment by x inches, and
that of the less by (4 - x) inches.
.". 4(4-x)=x 2 , or x' 2 +4x=l6.
From this we get x= -2 i 2\/5 ; and for internal division x
must be positive, hence the req d value is or 2 - 47.


2. For Construction, see the Note and Fig. of p. 241.
Let the segment measured from A contain x inches, and let
that measured from B contain 2 - x inches.
Then for medial section, 2{2-x) = x 2.
From this quadratic, ,r=-l±*/5, or P 24 and -3'24.
For external division the segment AX' is taken in the sense
opposite to AB ; this fact is represented by the negative
sign. Hence AX'= - 3'24" nearly.
3. ByTheor. 29, AC 2 =AB 2 +BC 2 =a 2 +~=—.
/. AC=^#.
2i
Hence (i) AX =AD=AC-CB=—-~ ; (Fig. p. 240)
it it
(ii) AX'=AD=AC +CB = —+|. (Fig. p. 241)
The fact that AX' is to be measured in the opposite direction
to AB is expressed by affixing a negative sign (p. 132).
Thus the direction and magnitude of AX' are both given
by the statement AX'= - +-^)-
4. Let AB be divided in medial section at X.
From AX cut off AX' = BX.
Then we have AB.BX = AX 2 , and AX'=BX.
Now AB. BX=(AX + XB)XB = (AX + AX')AX' = AX. AX'+AX' 2 ;
And AX 2 =(AX'+X'X) AX=AX. AX'+AX. XX';
.-. AX.AX' + AX^AX.AX' + AX.XX';
whence AX' 2 =AX. XX'.
That is, AX is divided in medial section at X'.

1. Let Abe the vertical angle. Then each of the base angles
is 2A. .'. A+2A +2A = 180° [ Th . 16] ; whence A = 36°.
2. Let BAD be a rt. angle. On AB by Prob. 34, construct an
isosceles A BAG having each of the l‘ at B, C double
the L A.
Bisect l BAG by AK.
Then l BAG=36°, by Ex. 1.
.'. L BAK = 18° = one-fifth of a rt. L.


3. The A AXC is such aA.
As in Prob. 34, /.ABC = 2/. BAC, and /.BCX=/.BAC.
Now /.AXC=/.ABC+/. BOX; [Th. 16.]
= 3/.BAC.
Also UX AC, XCA are equal [Prob. 34].
/. A AXC is isosceles : and its vertical angle is three times
either angle at the base.
To construct the A, take any centre A, and with any radius
AB describe aO. Divide AB at Xso that
AB.BX = AX 2 . [Prob. 33.]
With centre X, and radius XA, cut the first 0 in C.
Then AXC is the req d A.
4. Let AB= a. Then BC = XA=a. ~ [Prob. 33. Note.]

" AB — 2 ‘
5. (i) Because BC touches the O ACF ; /.ACB=/.AFC.
But z.ABC = /.ACB, and /.ACF=/.AFC; [Th. 6.]
whence, by Theor. 16, the L BAC=/.CAF.
.‘. BC = CF. [Th. 42 and 45.]
(ii) The A s BAC, XAC have equal bases BC, XC and equal
vertical angles BAC, XAC.
.'. their circum-circles are equal. [Ex. 2, p. 206.]
(iii) By (i) the U BAC, CAF are equal; and by Ex. I each
must be 36°, or one-tenth of 360°.
Hence, by Prob. 30, BC, CF are sides of a regular decagon
inscribed in the, O BCD.
(iv) By (i) and Ex. 1, each of the /. S ACX, XAC, CAF is 36°.
:. each of the arcs AX, XC, CF subtends 36° at the O ce of
O AXC.
.'. each of the arcs AX, XC, CF subtends 72° at the centre of
OAXC.
But 72° is one-fifth of 360°.
;., as in Prob. 30, AX, XC, CF are sides of a regular pentagon
inscribed in the O AXC.


6. Take S' the mid-pt. of the arc XC. Join AS', S'C.
Then because the arc XS'=arc S'C ; AS' bisects the L BAC.
But Z.XAS'=Z.XCS' [Th. 39] ; and L BAC=AXCB[iVoi. 34] ;
CS'bisects the Z.XCB.
Now since the A 8 BAC, BCX are both isosceles, the bisectors
of their vertical angles will also bisect their bases at
rt. L‘. [Th. 4.]
AS' and CS' will, if produced, bisect BC and BX at rt. U.
:. S' is the circum-centre of the A CBX.
7. Bv the last example S' is the intersection of the bisectors of
the U BAC, BCX.
Also I is the intersection of AS' and CX, for these bisect the
L? BAC, ACB respectively.
Again I' is the intersection of Bl and CS', the bisectors of the
a-XBC, xcb.
From the A lAB, the ext. A S'l I'=lAB +Z. IBA

8. Let AB be divided in medial section at X, so that AB . BX=AX 3 .
Then (AX+XB)(AX-XB)=AX 2 -XB 2 [Th. 53.]

1. Since the sum of the roots is 10 and their product is 16, the
solution will be given by dividing a line of 10 cm. into

Examples 2, 3 are done similarly.


4. Divide a line 5 cm. long externally, so that the rectangle
contained by the segments is 36 sq. cm. Apply 11. p. 245.

1. Let Abe the pt. (0, 4) and B the pt. (0, 9).
Then, by Theor. 58, OP 2 =0A.08 = 4 x 9=36.
.-. OP=6.
2. Let A be the pt. (9, 6). From A draw AB perp. to OY and
meeting it at B. Then OB is the tangent from Oto the
circle. Hence rect. contained by the segments of any
chord through 0 = 0B 2 =36.
Again let P be the pt. (9, 12), and CPAD the diameter
through P.
Then the rect. CP. PD is required. [7%. 57.]
Now CP=CA-AP=3 ; and PD = PA+AD = 15.

3. Let A, B, Cbe the pts. in the given order, and let OY cut the
O again at D.
/. OC.OD=OA.OB. [Th. 58.]
oD=^=l6.
Also, if OT be the tangent from O to the ©,
OT 2 = OA. OB = 144 ; whence OT = 12.
4. Let A, B, Cbe the pts. in the given order. A circle can be
drawn through A, B, C by Prob. 25.
Also OA 2 =loo =sx 20 = 08. OC ; and .'. OA toucher, the 0

Let P be the centre of the O, and from P draw PK perp.

.‘. coords, of P are (10, 12j), and radius of © = PA = 12j.


5. Let A, B, Cbe the given pts., and let the O cut OY again in D.
OC. OD=OA. OB [Th. 58]; hence 00=*^^ =24
.'. D is the pt. (0, 24).
The centre lies on the line which bisects AB at rt. L", i.e. on
x=l7.
It also lies on the line which bisects CD at rt. L’, i.e. on
y= lB.
the centre is the pt. (17, 18).
(Tangent) 2 = OA.OB = 16x18 = 16x9x2.
/. tangent = 12\/2 = 16’97... =l7 nearly.
6. (i) Here OA.OB = 12x6, and OC.OD=9xB; (numerically)
.-. OA. OB = OC. OD ;
.'. the points A, B, C, D are conoyelic. [Ex. 6, p. 236.]
(ii) Join AC, BD.
Then OA 2 +OC 2 +OB 2 +OD 2 =AC 2 +BD 2 . [7%. 29.]
And since the chords AB, CD cut at rt. angles,
the arcs AC, BD make up a semi-circumference. [Ex. 8, p. 170.]
AC 2 + BD 2 = (diameter) 2 ; [Th. 41 and 29.]
or, OA 2 +OB 2 + OC 2 +OD 2 =4r 2 .
The particular case may be verified by substitution.
7. Let A and Bbe the points (0, 9) and (3, 0).
Through A draw AP perp. to OY ; then the centre must lie
on AP.
Bisect AB at rt. angles by a line which cuts AP at C. Then
C is the centre of the required O.
Let D be the second point of intersection of this O with OX.
Then 08. OD = OA 2 . [Th. 58], whence OD =— — = 27.
;. Dis the pt. (27, 0).
From C draw CM perp. to BD, and bisecting it at its point
of intersection M.
Then radius=CA=OM = £(OB+OD)=15.


8. Let Abe the point (0, 8), M and M' the pts. (0, 13), (0, -13)
respectively.
Then the centre of the req d Q must lie on one of the two
lines drawn through M, NT par 1 to OX.
It must also lie on a ©, centre A, radius = 13.
The intersection of these two loci give two positions of the
centre, P and Q, each lying on the parallel through M.
Since the common chord of two O* is perp. to the line of
centres, the second pt. of intersection, B, of the two circles
also lies on OY.
Let the 0 whose centre is P touch OX at C.
.-. OA.OB=OC 2 =PM 2 =AP 2 -AM 2 =l3 2 -5 2 =144.

9. Draw two st. lines each parallel to OX and at a distance 16
from it on either side. With centre O, and radius 15+15
i.e. 30, describe aO. This cuts each of the two lines in
two pts. Any one of these four pts. is a possible position
of the centre of the required 0. [Proof. l)y Loci (iv) and
(v), p. 188.] Hence there are four possible circles.
Let Abe that centre which lies in the Ist1 st quadrant, and AM
its perp. on OX. Then OA=3O and AM =l5.
/. OM 2 =OA 2 -AM 2 ,whenceOM =ls\^3=2s - 98...0r26,nearly.
Thus the coords, of A are (26, 15).
10. Draw any circle through A and B. Take any convenient
point Q on this 0, and draw a © through C, D, Q
[ Prob . 25]. Let Rbe the 2 nd pt. of intersection of the
two ©*, and let QR produced meet the .r-axis in P.
Then PA .PB = PQ. PR ; [ Th . 58.]

Let OP=x. .’. PA=.r -a, PB =x —b,PC~c —x, PD =d—x.

Since AX : XB = 5 ; 7, if AX is divided into 5 equal parts, then
XB must contain 7 such equal parts.

OP mark off OA=B cm. and OB=7 cm. to represent the
distances reached by A and B at the end of any interval.
Join AQ and through B draw BK par 1 to AQ to meet OQ
in K. Then since OQ :OK= OA : OB=B :7, the distance
by which A beats B is measured by KQ which is found to
be 1'25 cm. Hence A wins by (l - 25 x 10) yds., or 12'5 yds.
3. On drawing a plan it is seen that BAG is a rt. l ;

But 1" represents 25 mi.; distance between B and C

Let y ft. be the length of the boy’s shadow ;

5. If x ft. be the height of lamp-post, we have, by similar A’

Let y ft. be the length of man’s shadow in his 2" d position ;
7+y :y=24:6=4; 1.

6. Let AB represent the breadth of the canal, Cin AB produced
the stand-point of the man, CE, BD the heights of the

Then A 8 FKD, FLB are similar.
.-. LB ; KD-—LF : KF,

LB = 66§ ft.
Now height of tower=AL+Lß=72 ft.
8. For the ground plan let A represent the foot of the light-house,
C, - D the man’s two stand-points, P and Q the extremities
of the shadow in the two positions.
Then +ACD=rt. l, CP=24ft., DQ=3oft.
Let AB, a vertical at A, represent the light-house, # ft. high,
and CE, DF the man’s height in his two positions. Then
CE, DF both represent 6 ft., and BEP, BFQ are st. lines.
From similar A 8 BAP, ECP, we have AP : GP=AB: CE ;
or, AP :24 =#; 6 ; whence AP=4#, and AC=4#-24.
Similarly from A 8 BAQ, FDQ, AQ = s#, and .'. AD = s#-30.
From the rt ,-L? A ACD, we have AD 2 =AC 2 +CD 2 ;
or, (s#-30) 2 = (4#-24) 2 + 300 2 , since CD = 300 ft.
.-. 25(#-6) 2 = 16(#-6) 2 +90000;
whence #= 106.

1. (i) In the Fig. of Theor. 68 we see that if A'B';AB = 3:4,
we have also SA':SA = 3:4. Hence the following con-
struction.
Take any pt. S as centre of similarity, and join SA, SB, SC, SD.
Divide SA internally at A' so that SA': SA = 3 :4.
Through A' draw A'B' par 1 to AB to meet SB in B'.
Through B' draw B'C' par 1 to BC to meet SC in C'.
Through C' draw C'D' par 1 to CD to meet SD in D'.
Join A'D'. Then A'B'C'D' is the req d quad 1 .
From the similar A» SAB, SA'B', SA'; SA=SB': SB..
Similarly SB': SB = SC': SC, and SC': SC = SD': SD.
.'. SA' : SA=SD': SD ; whence A'D' is par 1 to AD. [ Th . 60.]
Hence A'B'C'D' has each of its sides par 1 to the corresponding
side of ABCD, and is . - . equiangular to it.
Also A'B': AB = SA': 8A =3: 4.
(ii) Divide SA externally at A' so that SA';SA=S:4, and
proceed as in (i).
2. On AB construct the square ABCD. Join O (the centre of the
semi-O) to C, Dby lines cutting the O ce in c, d. Through
c, d draw cb, da par 1 to CB and meeting AB in b and a.
Join cd.
Then Oc=Od, and OC =CD ; whence cd is par 1 to CD. Thus
abed is a rectangle.
Also by similar A s , cb :CB=Oc ; OC = cd : CD.
And CB = CD; .'. ch = cd. Hence abed is a square.
It is easy to prove Oa = Oh. Ob =
n 2
But 0c 2 = 06 2 + 6c 2 . .‘. r 2 — — + a 2; whence 4r 2 = 5a 2 .
3. Let OA, OB be the bounding radii of the sector. On AB, and
on the side of it -remote from O, describe the sq. ABCD.
Join OC, OD cutting the arc in c and d. Join cd. Then
it can easily be shewn that cd is par 1 to CD. From c and
d draw cb, da par 1 to CB, DA. Join ab.


As in Ex. 1, it may be shewn that ah is par 1 to AB.
Also by similar A', ah : AB= Oa : OA =ad : AD ;
alternately, ah : ad=Aß : AD ;
but AB=AD ; ah —ad, and abed is a square.
By measurement, a= l - 24", whence a : r=o’s2 : 1.
4. Let OA, OB be the bounding radii of the sector.
On the chord AB describe a rect. ABCD ha'ving AD = 2AB.
Complete the construction as in Ex. 3, and prove ah par 1 to cd.
Then ah : AB = Oa : OA=arf : AD.
.'., alternately, ah: ad =AB:AD= 1; 2.
Thus abed is a rect. having ad=2ab.
By describing on AB a rect. such that AD=|AB, we can in-
scribe in the sector another rect. a'b'c'd' having a’d' = \a'b’.
By measurement, ad= 3T cm., a'b’= 2 - 8 cm.
ad-.a'h'— 3l:2B.
5. On the side of BC remote from A describe the square BCDF.
Join AD, AF cutting BC in d and f
Through d, f draw dc and fh par 1 to DC, FB to meet AC, AB

As in Ex. 1, he is par 1 to BC, hence hedf is a rect.
Also by similar A B , be :BC=Ac ; AC = cd: CD ;
alternately, he : cd— BC : CD ;
butBC=CD; hc—cd, and hedf is a square.
6. (i) On the side of BC remote from A describe an equilateral
A DBG.
Join AD cutting BC in d. From d draw dh and dc par 1 to
DB, DC and meeting AB, AC in h and c. Join be.
Then by similar A B , A 6 : AB=A(f: AD=Ac : AC.
Thus he is par 1 to BC.
Hence A dhc has each of its sides par 1 to the corresponding
side of A DBC, and is equiangular to it.
That is, dhc is an equilateral A.


(ii) Draw RQ par 1 to the given line to meet AB, AC in R and Q.
On QR describe the equilateral A PQR.
Join AP, producing it if necessary to cut BC in p, From p
draw pq, pr par 1 to PQ, PR, and meeting AC, AB in q and r.
Then, as in Ex. 6 (i), the A pqr is equilateral.
Draw any line RQ cutting AB, AC in R and Q.
On the side •of QR remote from A describe a A PQR equi-
angular to the A DEF.
Join AP, producing it if necessary to cut BC in p. Through
p draw pq, pr par 1 to PQ, PR and meeting AC, AB in q
and r.
Then, as in Ex. 6, the A pqr is equiangular to the A PQR,
and .'. also to the A DEF.
Hence, by Theor. 64, the A pqr is similar to the A DEF.
Since RQ may be drawn in any direction, the number of
solutions is infinite.
8. On the same side of DE as AB describe the square DEMK.
Produce CD, FE to meet in O, and let OK, OM cut BC, AF
in P and Q.
Join PQ, and draw PS, QR par 1 to KD, ME and meeting
CD, EF in S and R. Join RS. Then PQRS is the req d
square.
It is easy to shew that A 8 OED, OFC are isosceles.
Hence from the congruent A 9 ODK, OEM, we have OK = OM,
and also L DOK = i. EOM.
.'. by Theor. 17 the A“OCP, OFQ are congruent, and OP =OQ
Hence PQ is par 1 to KM.
Next, as in Ex. 1, prove DE par 1 to SR. Then PQRS is a par m ,
and is rectangular by construction.
Also by similar A B , PQ :KM=OP:OK = PS : KD.
Alternately, PQ:PS=KM:KD.
But KM = KD, PQ = PS, and the figure is a square.

fixed; .'. locus of Qisa 0, having centre D and radius DQ.
21. Let CD be the perp. and let CD meet the first © at G, and
the second 0 at O and O'.
Since the 0 s are equal, the distances from D of the two
points on the one O are respectively equal to the dis-
tances of the two points on the other.
Let O be the point corresponding to G.
Then O is thq orthocentre [Ex. 1, p. 209], for DO = DG.
If C is within the second ©, then O' is the orthocentre.
Otherwise. The L AGB is the supplement of the L ACB [Th. 40],
And since the segments AGB, AOB are equal [Hyp. and Th. 44.]
.'. l AGB=Z. AOB, .‘. l AOB is supp 4 of L ACB.
;. orthocentre is on arc AOB [III. p. 210]. But the ortho-
centre is on perp. CD. orthocentre is at O.
22. Call the © 8 (i), (ii), (iii). Let (i) and (iii) intersect again
at B, (ii) and (iii) at C, (i) and (ii) at D.
Then as in the second proof of the last exercise it may.be

of the A ABC lies on the arc ADB- Similarly, by means


of the ©‘ (ii) and (iii) the orthocentre of the A ABC lies

Then the vertex of required A lies on PQ.
Let © B with centres A, B and radii equal to K intersect at S,
on the same side of AB as PQ.
From centre S, with radius K, intersect PQ at Cor C'. Then

25. Let ABC be a triangle of the system on the fixed base AB.
Produce AC to D, making CD equal to CB.
Then AD is of constant magnitude. Join BD cutting the
bisector of the A BCD at P. Then CP bisects BD at rt.
angles. Required the locus of P.
Bisect AB at O. Join OP. Then OP=MD. [Ex. 3, p. 64.]
That is, OP is constant; and since Ois a fixed point, the locus
of P is a circle, whose centre is at O, and whose radius is
half AD.
26. It has been proved in YII. p. 214, that if I, 1,, 12,l 2 , l 3 are the
centres of the inscribed and escribed circles of the A ABC,
each of these four points is the orthoceutre of the triangle
formed by the other three, and that the original A ABC
is the pedal triangle.
Hence given any three of the points I, l lf 12,l 2 , 13,l 3 , we have only
to draw the pedal triangle of the triangle so formed.


27. Draw CD perp. to BC to meet the circum-O at D. Join AD,

Then BD is a diam., and AD is perp. to BA. [Th. 41.]
But CO produced is also perp. to AB [Hyp.~\ ; .'. AD and CO
are par 1 . And by construction AO and DC are par 1 :
.'. AO= DC. [Th. 21.]
But, since BCD is a rt. L, BD 2 =BC 2 + CD 2 , [Th. 29.]

35. Let P, Qbe the given pts. Divide PQ, internally and ex-
ternally, at A and Bin the given ratio [ Prob. 37]. On AB
as diameter describe a O. Then the distances of P and
Q from any pt. on this circle are in the given ratio
[Ex. 8, p. 259]. The pt. or pts., if any, where this O cuts
the given O are the pts. required.
36. Let the bisector of the vert. Lbe a part of PQ, a line of
unlimited length. Bisect AB, the given base, at rt. angles,
by a line which cuts PQ at X.
Describe a O about AXB, and let it cut PQ again at C. Then

38. Let Pbe the given pt. and O the centre of the given O.
On OP describe a segment of a O containing an angle of 45°
[Proh. 24]. Let this cut the given O in Q. Join PQ
cutting the 0“ again in R.
Then z.ORQ=/-OQR=45°.
z.QOR = 90°. [Th. 16.]
39. With figure of p. 207, let Sbe the centre of circum.O, and
let SA meet EF at X.
Then Z. AFX =Z_ ACB. [II. Cor. ii, p. 208.]
And <lASß=twice Z.ACB, [Th. 38.]
.'. Z.SAB = 90°-Z.ACB. [Th. 5, 16.]
Hence from A AFX, the L AXF is a rt. angle. [Th. 16.]
40 Since the A 1 CEP, CDP are rt. angles, the 0 about the A PED
passes through C, and is described on PC as diam. Hence
it is required to find the locus of X, the middle point of CP.
Take S the centre of the O and join SX.
Then since the Z.CXS is a rt. angle [Th. 31], and the points
C, S are fixed, .'. the locus of X is a 0 on CS as diam.
41. Take the figure of p. 212. Draw the diam. AX, and join AP, PX.

angle. Make the Z.ABK half the given diflf. of the base
angles : and draw BD perp. to BK to cut the larger seg-
ment at D. Join AD, cutting the smaller segment at C

43. Let ACD, AEF and BEC, BED be the two pairs of lines. Let the
O 8 about the A B ACE, BEF meet at P. Then shall the 0 s
about the A S AFD, BCD pass through P. Join PF, PE, PA.
Then z.BFP = ,IBEP [Tk. 39.]
= L PAC. [Ex. 5, p. 163.]
Hence A PAD, PFD together = two rt. angles.
the points A, D, F, P are concyclic; that is, the O about
the A ADF passes through P.
The proposition may also be proved by the properties of
Simson’s Line [See V. and Ex. 3, p. 212],
44. From the last exercise it is seen that the ©“ about the four
A 8 pass through a common point P. Hence it may be
seen (Ex. 3, p. 212) that the four A 8 have a common
pedal for the point P.
Also {Ex. 4, p. 212) this pedal bisects each of the lines joining
P to the four orthocentres.
Hence, by the method of Ex. 9, p. 94, the orthocentres are
collinear.
45. For suppose any two consecutive sides AB, BC of an inscribed
polygon are unequal. Let P be the middle point of the
arc AC.
Then AP, PC are together greater than AB, BC [See Ex. 19,
p. 318]; and A APC is greater than A ABC, for it has
a greater altitude.
Hence there is an inscribed polygon which has a greater
perimeter and a greater area than the given polygon.
an inscribed polygon cannot have the maximum perimeter
or maximum area unless every pair of consecutive sides
are equal; that is, unless it is regular.
46. Let E be the middle pt. of AB. f Then, since diagonals of a
par 1 " bisect one another, Eis middle pt. of CD.
Draw DO, par 1 to EP, meeting CP in O. Then A 8 DOC, EPC
are similar. OC = twice PC, and CD = twice PE ; hence
Ois a fixed point, and CD is of constant length. /. the
locus of D is a O, having the fixed pt. O as centre.


47. Let ABC be the isosceles A. Draw AD perp. to the base BC.
At A make the L" DAE, DAF each 30°, E and F being in
BC. Then AEF is an equilateral A. Front AE, AF cut
off AG, AH each equal to the mean proportional between
AE and BC. Then by similar A 8 AGH, AEF,

48. Let MAN be the given vert. L. Along AM, AN take AP, AQ
each equal to half the given sum of the sides containing
■ the vert. L.
, Let ABC be one Aof the system. Then clearly PB = CQ.
At P and Q draw PX, QX perp. to AM and AN. Then Xis a
fixed point; and it may be shewn [Th. 18] that PX = QX.
Hence the A B BPX, CQX are identically equal [Th. 4].
the L PXB = the L QXC : to each add the L PXC ;
then the l BXC = the L PXQ.
But since the U at P and Q are rt. angles, the L‘ PXQ, PAQ
are supplementary; the U BXC, BAG are supple-
mentary.
X is on the 0 about the A ABC. Thus the © passes
through two fixed points A and X. Hence the locus of the
centre is the st. line bisecting AX at rt. angles.
49. Let D, E, Fbe the vertices of the equilateral A’. Then the
A 8 BAE, FAC are identically equal. BE = FC. But the
A 8 ZAB, YAC are similar ;

But L ZAY = L FAC. A 8 ZAY, FAC are similar.

fig. considered P is outside the given O.] Join PQ and


in it take a pt. F so that rect. PF, PQ=the rectangle con-

Let K be the length of a chord of the © which subtends
at the 0“ an angle equal to the aQZY ; through F draw
a line FBD cutting off a chord BD equal to K [by using
Theor. 34 and Ex. 2, p. 177]. Draw PBA meeting © in
B, A, and join AQ meeting the ©in C. Then ABC is the
required A.
Because rect. PF, PQ=rect. PB, PA ;
PF : PA = PB : PQ, [Ex. 12, p. 253.]
.'. A 5 PFB, PAQ are similar. [Th. 64.]
.-. L PFB=Z. PAC
=L BDC, (or the supplement Of BDC ;)
DC is par 1 to PQ.
And because L DCB =L QZY ;
BC is par 1 to XY.
51. Let P, Q, Rbe the given pts. Join PQ and determine a pt. F
in it as in Ex. 50.
In the circle inscribe a A DBC so that DB and BC pass through
F and R respectively, while DC is par 1 to PQ \Ex. 50].
Produce PB to meet the O™ in A ; join QA meeting the O c, in
C', and join DC'.
Then l BAQ=z. FDC' in the same segment.
Also, as in Ex. 50, the A 8 PFB, PAQ are similar ;
.-. L PAQ =L PFB=alt. L FDC.
Hence C' coincides with C, and the A ABC fulfils the
required conditions.

Take OE a mean prop 1 between OA and OY and describe a ©

Draw OC par 1 to HK. 00 is the required locus.
For, draw KQ perp. to OB to meet 00 in Q, and QR perp. to
OA. Also, from any pt. Pin 00, draw PM perp. to OA

Join SI, and produce it both ways to meet the O" at P, Q.
Hence XI. 1A = PI. IQ [Th. 57.]
=(PB+SI)(SQ -SI)
= R 2 —SI 2 ;
hence SI 2 =R 2 —2Rr.


(ii) Similarly, if lj, 12,l 2 , l 3 are the centres and r v r 2, r 3 the radii
of the escribed O', it may be shewn that
Sl 1 2 =R2 + 2Rr 1 ; SI 2 2 =R 2 + 2Rr 2 ;
and Sl 3 2 =R 2 + 2 Rr 3 ,
P
(iii) To prove IN = g-r. (Feuerbach’s Theorem.)
22
We here give an outline of Feuerbach’s proof, one step of
which depends on trigonometrical work.
Let S, I, and N be the centres of the circumscribed, inscribed,
and nine-point O s of the A ABC, and O its orthocentre.
Let AO meet BC at D, and the O oe of the circumscribed
©at G. Join SI, 10, and SO ; and let SO produced both
ways meet the O ce at P and Q.
Then N is the middle point of SO [p. 211].
And since IN is a median of the A SIO,
.'. SI 2 + I0 2 = 2IN 2 + 2SN 2 ,
or SI 2 +l0 2 =21N 2 + £S0 2 (i)
But SI 2 =R 2 - 2Rr ; and SO 2 =R 2 - PO. OQ [ Th. 53.]
=R 2 - AO. OG.
Also it may be proved by trigonometry from the A lAO that
I0 2 = 2r 2 —AO. OD
= 2r 2 - |AO. OG. [Ex. 1, p. 209.]
Substituting these results in (i), we have
2(R 2 -2Rr) + 4r 2 -AO. OG = 4IN 2 + R 2 -AO. OG,
or, R 2 4Rr+4r 2 = 4IN 2 ,
i.e., (R-2r) 2 = (2IN) 2 ,
R ...
.. 2~r= IN.
Remembering that the radius of the nine-points O is half the
radius of the circumoircle we see that the nine-points ©
touches the inscribed ©.
R
(iv) Similarly we may prove that and similar
formulae for Nl 2 , Nl 3 ; whence the nine-pts. O touches the
3 escribed ©“.

1. Let the given circle cut the axis of yin B, B'. Through
the given pt. A (20, 0) draw FAF' par 1 to OY. Join AB,
AB' cutting the O ce in E, E' respectively. Produce OE,
OE' to meet AF in F and F'.
Then the O s whose centres are F, F' and radii FA, F'A
respectively will each satisfy the req d conditions.
For z.FAE = /_OBE [Th. 14] = [Th. 5] = ;
FE = FA.
LetAF=#; then OF =OE+EF= 10 + #.
But OF 2 = OA 2 + AF 2 ; (10+,j;) 2 = 20 2 +x 2 ; whence x=ls.
radius of the 0 = 15.
From E draw ED perp. to OX.
Then OD : OA = ED : FA = OE : OF. [3%. 62.]
But OF = OE + EF=25 ; OE:OF=2:S;
hence OD =B, ED =6.
coords, of E are (8, 6).
2. Let Abe the given pt. (6, 8). Draw AP the tangent at A
cutting OY in P. With centre P, and radius PA, describe
a O cutting OY on K, K' (K being outside the 0). From
K, K' draw perp 8 to OY meeting OA in C, O'. Then
the O 8 whose centres are C and O', and radii CK, C'K'
respectively, satisfy the required conditions.
For the rt.-A 1 A" CKP, CAP are congruent [Th. 18]; and
/. CK = CA.
Now if AM be the perp. from A on OY, we have, by Theor. 62,
OC : CK = OA : AM = 10:6.
, dividendo, OC :OC—CK = 10 :10 -6=5 : 2.
Hence, remembering that OC CK=OC-CA=OA=IO,
we get OC = 25, and CA = 15.
OK WOC 2 - CK 2 =\ / 25 2 -16 s = 20.
radius of the larger ©is 15, and its pt. of contact is (0,20).
Similarly smaller© is3|, (0,5).


3. Analysis. Let BOC be the given quadrant, A being the
mid.-pt. of the arc BC. Then by symmetry the req d ©
will touch the arc at A. Let Mbe its pt. of contact with
OC. Draw AT touching the quadrant at A and cutting
OC produced at T. Then TM =TA.
Construction. Draw AT touching the arc at its mid.-pt. A and
cutting one of the bounding radii OC at T. With centre
T and radius TA cut this radius at M. From M draw
MR perp. to OC and meeting OA in P. Join PT.
Then the A S TMP, TAP are congruent [ Th. 18]. Hence
PM = PA; and by Theor. 18, PM=perp. from P on 08.
a © whose centre is P and radius PM is the req d ©.
Let radius =r inches; then OM =PM =r. and OP=2-r.
But OP 2 = OM 2 +MP 2 ; .’. (2- r) 2 =r 2 + r-, whence r 2 + 4r -4 =O.
Solving the equation we get r = 2 ± ; whence, reject-
ing the negative root, the radius = -2) ins. = 0'83",
nearly.
4. Let Abe the pt. (2, 2). Join OA, and draw AT perp. to OA to
meet OY in T. From TO and TY cut oif TP and TQ
respectively, each equal to TA. Let the perps. from P and
Q to OY meet OA, or OA produced, in C and C'.
Then, from the congruent A S TPC, TAG, we have CP=CA;
also C'Q = C'A.
Hence the 0 s whose centres are C and C', and radii CA and
C'A respectively, will satisfy the req d conditions.
Now OA = V2 2 + 2 3 =2V2; OP =CP= r ; and OC = 2\^2-r.
But OC 2 = OP 2 +CP 2 ; (2v / 2-r) 2 =r 2 + r 2;
whence r 2 + 4rV2-8 =O.
5. Let the pts. in the given order be A, B, C and D. Let AB and
CD intersect in P. Then it is easy to prove that OP
bisects the z_APD, and that the figure is symmetrical
about OP. From O draw ON perp. to CD, and bisect the
L PON by OQ meeting PD ill Q. From Q, draw QK par 1 to
ON and meeting OP in K. Then L KQO =Z. NOQ [Th. 14.]
=/.KOQ [Const"\ KQ = KO. By symmetry, or by
congruent A* [Th. 17], KQ is the perp. from K on AB.
the 0 whose centre is K, and radius = KO, is the req d ©.


6. Let ABC be the given equilateral A ; and AD, BE, CF the three
medians, meeting at O. Then, by Theor. 7, AD bisects
l. BAG and is perp. to BC.
Bisect by FP meeting OB at P. Then since P lies on
the bisectors of each of the U OFB, FBD, FOD, a circle can
be described with centre P to touch each of the sides of
the quad 1 BFOD. \Proh. 26.]
Along OA, OC cut off OQ, OR each equal to OP.
Then from P, Q, and R as centres it follows by symmetry that
equal circles can be drawn, each touching two sides of the
A ABC and the other two circles.
Let M be the foot of the perp. from P on AB.
Then FM = PM=r; and BM =PM tan BPM=rtan6o°.
Now FB=4AB =f ; and FB =FM+ BM ; .•.»•(!+tan 60°) =f.
Also tan 60° =V3 ; r= .3 = 1)=0-55''.
+ l) 4
7. Let OA, 08, OC be three radii each inclined at 120° to the
others. Join AB.
Then it may be proved that AB is perp. to CO produced.
Bisect L OAB by AD meeting CO produced in D : and through
D draw DP, par 1 to AB, to meet OA in P. Then l OOP is
a rt L.
And L PDA=£. DAB [Th. 14] =z. PAD ; whence PA=PD.
Hence a O, centre P and radius PA will touch the given ©
and also CO produced at D.
Along 08, OC mark off OQ, OR each equal to OP.
It is now easy to shew that P, Q, R are the centres of the
req d o s .
OP=PD cosec POD = r cosec 60°; and OA = OP+PA.
.■. 2=r cosec 60° 4- r ;
or r(l+cosec6o°)=2.
Now cosec 60°= —V3)

1. Take one of the given sides as base, and from an extremity of
this base, with the other side as radius, describe a 0.
Then the vertex of the A must lie on this O. Now, the base
being given, the A is greatest when the altitude is greatest:
this may readily be shewn to be when the second side is
drawn at rt. angles to the first [ Th. 10].
2. If the base AB and area of a A ABC are given, the vertex C
must move on a st. line PQ par 1 to the base AB [Th. 27].
And since AB is fixed, the perimeter is least when the sum of
AC, BC is least. This is the case when
the z_PCA = the Z.QCB. [Ex. 3, p. 316.]
But L PCA=z_CAB, and [Th. 14.]
.-. z_CAB=z.CBA; .'. AC = BC. [Th. 6.]
If AB = 2 - 0", and area = 3T2 sq. in.;
~ I*-t a area of A 3T2 „
the altitude— * hase I*o
since the A is isosceles,
AC 2 = I 2 +(3T 2) 2 =lO-7344 sq. in.
whence AC = </10’7344 =3 - 276".
.’. perimeter (when minimum) = 8'55" approx.
3. Since the base- BC and the vertical angle are given, the vertex
A must move on the segment of a O described on BC to
contain an angle of 60°. [Th. 39. Com.]
Also since the base is given, the A is greatest when the
altitude is greatest, which is when A lies on AX the
perpendicular bisector of BC.
For take any other pt. P oil the arc and draw PM perp. to
BC meeting the diameter par 1 to BC at N. The centre
O lies on AX.
Then OP> PN [Th. 10]; .-. OA> PN.
.-. AX > PM, for OX= NM.
Since AB =AC [Th. 4], and z_ BAG = 60°, the A must be equi-
lateral.
.-. BA =BC = 10cm. Hence, by Theor. 29, AX = cm,
area =iBC . AX --- 2O'/3 sq. cm, =43 30 sq. cm.


4. Bisect AB at C, and from C draw CM, CN perp. to OX, OY
respectively. Then CM is par 1 to 08, and by Theor. 22,
OM=JOA = T 5". Thus M lies on the O, and CM is a
tangent. Similarly CN is a tangent. Then c MCN will be
the maximum angle contained by tangents drawn from
pts. on AB.
For take any other pt. P on AB and draw the tangents PQ,
PQ'. Then OP>OC. [Th. 12.]
.-. OQ 2 +QP 2 >OM 2 + MC 2 [Th. 29] ; whence QP> MC.
Now apply the AOQP to the AOMC so that OQ and OM
coincide and QP lies along MC. Then P lies in MC pro-
duced and .■. l OCM > l OPQ.
.'. the _ MCN (which is double L OCM) is greater than l QPQ'
(which is double the L OPQ).
By measurement L MCN is found to be a rt. angle, which was
to be expected since OMCN is a par 1 ", and L MON is a rt.
angle.
5. Let AB be the straight rod, C its middle point, and O the
intersection of the rulers. Then OC = half of AB, and is
constant for all positions of AB [Th. 41].
And since the base AB is given in magnitude, the area of the
A is greatest when the perp. from O on AB is the greatest.
Now when AB makes equal angles with the two rulers, OC is
perp. to AB [Th. 6 and 4]. And in any other position of
AB, OC is greater than the perp. from O on AB [Th. 12].
Hence the greatest A is obtained when AB is equally inclined
to the two rulers.
6. Let AB be the given line, and K the side of the given square.
(i) At B draw BC, making the £ ABC half a rt. angle.
From centre A, with radius K, describe a O cutting BC at P
(or P'). Draw PX perp. to AB.
Then, AX 2 +XB 2 = sq. on K.
For L XBP— J- rt, angle, and l. PXB = one rt. angle,
z_XPß=|rt. angle ; .'. PX = XB.
Hence AX 2 + XB 2 =AX 2 +XP 2
= AP 2 = sq. on K. [Th. 29]
K.S.G. N


(ii) Thus AX 2 + XB 2 is a minimum, when AP is a minimum;
that is, when AP is the perp. on BC.
In this case the L PAB = \ rt. angle=z. ABP.
AP= BP, and hence X is the middle point of AB.
7. (i) Let C, Dbe the centres of the given O* which intersect
at A, and X the given line.
On CD describe a semicircle; and from centre D with radius
equal to half of X cut this semicircle at E. Join ED. ’
Through A draw PAQ par 1 to ED. Then PQ is the line
required. Join CE and produce it to meet PQ at G, and
draw DH par 1 to CG, meeting PQ at H.
Then since L. CED is a right L, [Th. 41.]
CG, DH are perp. to PQ [7%. 14], and GH = ED = |X.
Also PQ=2GH ; [ Th. 31.]
.'. PQ=X, and is drawn through A.
(ii) We see that PAQ is a maximum, when ED is a maximum.
But ED has its greatest value when it coincides with CD.
Hence PQ is a maximum when it is par 1 to CD.
8. (i) Let OA, OB be the tangents. Take P the middle point of
the major arc AB, and let PX,PY be the perps. on OA, 08.
To prove that PX+PY is a maximum.
Ijet Q lie any other point on the arc AB (in the Fig. chosen,
Q is on PB), and QM, QN the perps. on OA, 08.
Let PY, QM intersect at R. Join PQ, OP.
Then since the tangent at P is perp. to OP, and Q is on the 0“,
;. the /.OPQ is less than a rt. L.
But l RPO=Z.POA=4S° ; .v L RPQ is less than 45°;
, from the rt. angled A QRP, the L RQP is greater than 45°;
L RPQ is less than L RQP.
RQ is less than RP. [Th. 10.]
Also RM = PX, and QN = RY.
RQ + RM +QN is less than RP + PX + RY,
or QM H-QN is less than PX + PY.


(ii) Similarly if P' is the middle point of the minor arc AB,
it can be proved that P'X+ P'Y is a minimum.
Let C be the centre of the O, then OACB is a square:
and CP=CB = 2'o".
Let PX meet the diam. par 1 to OX in H.
Then it is easily shewn that OX = PX, and CH =PH.
But 2CH 2 = CP 2 [Th. 29] = 4 sq. in. CH=V2iu.
.-. OX =OA+AX = (2 + V 2) in. = 3-414".
.-. OX +PX = 6-83".
Similarly OX'+ P'X' =(4 -2\/2) in. = IT7".
9. Let A and Bbe the fixed points, PQ the tangent at T, and let
=
To prove that AT + BT is a minimum.
This problem supposes that AB does not meet the O, and that
AT, BT are on the side of PQ remote from the O.
Take X any other point on the O™: then AX must cut
PQ [fTyjo.] at some point K. Join KB, XB.
Then AK + KB is greater than AT +TB ; [Ex. 3, p. 316.]
and AX + XB is greater than AK + KB. [Ex. 3, p. 34.]
Hence AX + XB is greater than AT + TB.
10. Let AP, AQ be st. lines of indefinite length including the
fixed vertical angle.
Let ABC be the isosceles A, having the given altitude AD.
And let AB'C' be any other A having an equal altitude AD'.
Then by Theor. 17, D is the middle point of BC.
Through D draw XDY par 1 to B'C' meeting AP, AQ at X, Y.
Now A ABC is leas than AAXY. [Ex. 4, p. 316.]
And A AXY is less than A AB'C by the strip B'XYC', since it
may be shewn that B'C' must lie on the side of XY remote
from A. For let XY meet AD', or AD' produced, at K :
then the Z.AKD is a rt. angle, .’. AD is greater than AK;
that is, AD' is greater than AK.
When the given vertical angle is 60°, for minimum area each
of the base angles must be also 60° [Th. 16]; and the
triangle is equilateral. Let 2 a be the length of each side.


Then by Th. 29, 4a 2 =a 1 +36 ; whence a= cm.
minimum area = |(6 x sq. cm. = 2078sq.cm, (to nearest
sq. mm.) ;
and perimeter of minimum A cm. =2o'B cm.
(to nearest mm.).
11. Let AP and AQ be the two fixed tangents, and BC any other
tangent to the convex arc. Let obe the centre of the ©,
D the pt. of contact of BC. Join 08, OC, OD, OP, OQ.
Then as in Th. 47, Cor., the A s BOP, BOD are congruent, and
the A a COD, COQ are also congruent.
Hence the fig. BPOQC = 2 A 800, and u POQ = 2/_ 800.
Now the quad 1 APOQ is of constant area, and the A BAG
is a maximum when the fig. BPOQC is a minimum ; that
is, when A 800 is a minimum.
But l POQ = a constant, and the altitude OD of the
A 800 is constant.
A BOC is a minimum when it is isosceles [Ex. 10]; that is,
when BC touches the arc PQ, at its middle point.
l - 2
12. Take AB = I'6" as base : then the altitude = = 1 '5".
U'o
C the vertex lies on a line XY par 1 to AB and distant T 5"
from AB : draw this line : and describe a circle to pass
through A, B, and touch XY at C [Ex. 2, p. 311], Then
the Z.ACB will be the greatest vertical angle ; and on
measurement it is found to be 56° (to the nearest degree).
Proof by Ex. 2, p. 315.
13. Let A, Bbe the given points (both without the given 0).
Through A and B describe a O to touch the given ©
externally at C [Ex. 3, p. 312],
To prove that ACB is the maximum angle. Let P be any
other point on the O ce of the given O. Join AP, BP, and
let AP meet the Oof construction at Q. Join QB.
Then Z.AQB is greater than ii APB ; [ Th. B.]
and z.AQB = /.ACB. [Th. 39.]
.'. L ACB is greater than L APB.
If A, B are both within the given ©, the © of construction
must be drawn so as to have internal contact. Here there
are always two solutions, and the one which gives the
greater angle must be chosen.


14. Draw aO to pass through A, B, and touch OY. [Ex. 2, p. 311.]
Let Pbe the pt. of contact. Then l APB will be the required
maximum angle [Ex. 2, p. 315],
Now OP 2 = OA.OB=O-Bxl-8 = l-44sq. in. [Th. 58.]
.. OP= I'2".
15. Let ABCD represent the bridge, where AB =49 ft., BC =32 ft.,
and CD—-49 ft. The st. line AP represents the bank.
Through B, C describe aO to touch AP at T [ Ex. 2, p. 311],
Then the arch BC subtends the greatest angle at T.
[Ex. 2, p. 315.]
Also AT 2 =AB.AC [Th. 58.]
= (49x81) sq. ft.
.'. AT =7x9 = 63 ft.
16. Since the sides AC, BC are constant, the area of the A ACB is
a maximum when they are at rt. angles [Ejt. 1, p. 317].
Draw any two radii CA', CB' at right angles, and join A'B'.
With centre C and radius equal to the perp. from C on A'B'
describe a O, and let the tangent from P to this 0 cut the
given Oin A and B. Then AB - A'B' [Th. 34], and hence
by Theor. 7 the iIACB is a rt. angle.
If the radius=6 cm.,
the area of A ACB = | AC. CB (since l ACB = 90°)
= J(6 x 6) sq. cm.
= 18 sq. cm.
17. Let ABCD be a rectangle inscribed in the given O.
Join AC. Then AC is a diameter. [ Th. 41.]
Now the rectangle is double of the A ABC.
And since the base AC is constant, the A ABC is greatest
when the altitude BX, namely the perp. from B on AC, is
greatest.
And BX may be shewn to be greatest when B is the middle
point of the arc AC. The rectangle then becomes a square.
And if the radius of the circle be 5 - 5 cm.,
area of the rect. = 2 A ABC = AC . BX = 11 x55=605 sq.cm.


18. Let O be the centre of the given ©. Bisect AB at X, and
join XO cutting the O ce at P. Join AP, PB.
To prove that AP 2 + PB 2 is a minimum.
Now AP 2 + PB 2 = 2AX 2 + 2XP 2 . [7V/. 56.]
Hence, since AX is constant, AP 2 + PB 2 is a minimum when XP 2
is a minimum.
But XP is the least of all st. lines drawn from X to the O'*.
[Th. 37.]
19. It is shewn in Ex. 4, p. 191, how to find a point C such that
AC+ BC may be equal to a given line H. Now the greatest
value H can have, in order that this construction should
be possible, is the diameter of the second segment there
employed. This determines the point X, and therefore the
point C: and it may easily be shewn by Theor. 41 that
CX =CB= CA ; that is, that C is the middle point of the
arc AB.
20. No inscribed triangle that is not equilateral can have the
maximum perimeter.
For let PQ,R be,an inscribed triangle not equilateral ; then it
must have one pair of sides unequal, say PQ, QR. Hence
there is an inscribed A on the base PR, which has a greater
perimeter [Ex. 19], .'. the A PQR is not the inscribed A
of greatest perimeter. And this argument may be applied
to all inscribed triangles not equilateral.
21. No inscribed triangle that is not equilateral can -have the
greatest area.
For let PQR be an inscribed A not equilateral ; then it must
have one pair of sides unequal, say PQ, QR. Hence [as in
Ex. 3, p. 317] there is an inscribed A on the base PR,
which has a greater area.
the A PQR is not the inscribed A of greatest area.
And this argument may be applied to all inscribed A* not
equilateral.
22. It has been proved [II. p. 208] that every two sides of the
pedal triangle are equally inclined to that side of the
original triangle in which they meet.
Also [Ex. 3, p. 316] if A and B are fixed points and P a point


in a given st. line CD, then AP+PB is a minimum when
these lines are equally inclined to CD.
Thus no triangle inscribed in the A ABC, that is not the pedal
triangle, can have the minimum perimeter.
For let PQR be an inscribed A, not the pedal A. , Then at
least one pair of its sides, say PR, QR, are not equally
inclined to the side AB in which they meet. Hence there
is an inscribed A on the base PQ which has a less perimeter.
the A PQR is not the inscribed Aof least perimeter. And
this argument may be applied to all inscribed A", except
the pedal A.
23. Adopting the figure of Prob. 32, p. 238
The sq. on BF = the rect. AC in area.
Now since BE = BC, it follows that AE is half the perimeter
of the rectangle ; .'. XF is one-quarter of the perimeter of
the rectangle. Also BF is one-quarter of the perimeter
of the square.
But XF>BF. [Th. 10.]
the perimeter of the square is less than the perimeter
of the rectangle.
24. Let D, E, F be the fixed points, and XYZ the given A.
Join FD, DE, and on these lines describe segments con-
taining the U Y, Z respectively.
Through D draw the maximum line BC terminated by the
two 0““ [Ex. 7, p. 317]. Join BF, CE ; and produce
them to meet at A.
Then since the U B, C are respectively equal to the u Y, Z,
the remaining l A = remaining IX. [Th. 16.]
And since the l.’ of the A ABC are fixed, the area is a
maximum, when any one of its sides is a maximum.
But BC is a maximum [t'onsir.\
the A ABC is a maximum.

The scales used in the following solutions are chosen for convenience

2. By actual measurement of the perpendiculars from Bon AC
corresponding to different values of C we obtain the
following tabulated results.
Now proceed as in Ex. 2j p. 321, taking one horizontal division
to every 6°, and 2 vertical divisions to every sq. cm.
The graph presents no difficulty ; and it will be found that
when C is 63° the area is B'9 sq. cm., and that when the
area is 9'5 sq. cm. the angle is either 72° or 108°. Also the
maximum area is 10 sq. cm., when C = 90°.
3. Let CA=.v cm., then, by Theor. 29, CB=V2S-,r i .
.'. area of A ABC=2 . AC. CB = jsx. </25 x l .
Hence by substituting different values for x we obtain
Taking 4 horizontal divisions for the x unit and 2 vertical
divisions for the A unit, we obtain the following graph.
It is shewn in Ex. 5, p. 317 that A is a maximum when the
rod is equally inclined to the two rulers ; and, by actual

calculation from Theor. 29, or by use of a larger graph, it
will be found that this occurs when CA = 3’53 cm.
4. (i) Let AP=.v cm.; ;. PB =lO —x. Hence denoting AP .PB
by y we must draw the graph of y-.r(lO-.r).
The following values may be used :
Hence taking 3 horizontal divisions as the unit of x and
1 vertical division to represent two units of y we obtain
the following graph.
It is seen that y has its maximum value at the point M whose
abscissa is 5. Hence AP. PB is a maximum when AP is
5 cm., that is, when P is at the mid.-pt. of AB.
(ii) Here y = AP 2 + PB 2 =.r 2 + (10 -xf = 100 - 2x(10~x).
Use the following values :
Taking 2 horizontal divisions as 1 unit of x, and 1 vertical
division as 2 units of y we have the adjoining graph.

It is seen that y has its minimum value at the point whose
abscissa is 5. Thus AP 2 +PB 2 is a minimum when
AP=6 cm., that is, when P is at the mid.-pt. of AB.
5. Draw an angle BAG = 60° with AB = 6 cm. By taking different
values of h along AC and measuring the corresponding
lengths of BC ( = «) we obtain the following table :
Taking 2 horizontal divisions to represent the unit of 6, and
10 vertical divisions to represent the unit of a we obtain
the adjoining graph.
The minimum value of a is seen to be 5'2 ; and on drawing
the triangle for this value we find that BC is perpendicular
to AC as we should expect from Theor. 12.

6. Take AB=lo cm. and measure the altitude {p) of the A PAB
for different values of the L PAB. Then since the area
(A)=i.p.Aß = bp,■ we have the following results for p
and A, in cm. and sq. cm. respectively :
the values, after those corresponding to 45°, recurring
in reverse order.
The graph is then as shewn, the scales being 1 horizontal
division = 3°, and 1 vertical division = 2 sq. cm., and it is
seen that A is maximum when the angle is 45°.
7. If we take yto represent the area of any one of the figures
and x to represent the length of the side on which it is
placed we know from Theor. 73 that the ratio y : x- is the
same for all the figures of the series. Thus the fraction
is constant and its value (which may be found if required
by calculation from any one of the figures) can be denoted
by m.. Hence if we draw the graph of =m,or y = mx 2 ,
the ordinate corresponding to any abscissa will give the
area of the figure whose side is equal to that abscissa.

If the given figures are squares, m= 1 for when x is 1 inch,
yis 1 sq. in. Hence the graph to be drawn is that of
y—x 2 which presents no difficulty. The abscissa corre-
sponding to the ordinate 11 *8 will be found to be 3'43.
[One inch on each axis will be found a convenient unit.]
8. (i) The graph is shewn in the diagram, the values being as
tabulated.
One division on each axis has been taken as unit,
(ii) Use the following values ;


Taking 2 horizontal divisions as the unit of x and 1 vertical
division for the unit oty we obtain the adjoining graph.
The maximum value of y is given by the maximum ordinate
which is seen to be 9.

3. See Theor. 61.


4. Let A be any pt. at which BP, PC subtend equal angles.
Divide BC externally at Q in the ratio BP ; PC, and join
AB, AC, AP, AQ.
Because l CAP [Hyp.], BA;AC = BP:PC [TO. 61.]
=BQ : QC. [Const’'.']
AQ bisects the Z.BAC externally. [TO. 61.]
.'. Z.PAQ is a rt. L.
But P, Q are fixed pts. .'. locus of Ais the circle on PQ as
diameter.
5. Let the line bisect the base BC at K, cut AB produced in P,
and AC in Q, and the par 1 to BC through A in M.
The A 8 KQC, MQA are similar by Theors. 14, 62 ;
.-. QK :QM= CK ;AM

;. P and Q divide KM harmonically.
6. Let a line through B meet the median AD in K, and cut AC
in Q, and the par 1 to BC through A in M.
Through K draw XKY par 1 to BC and meeting AB, AC in
X and Y.
Then by similar A B , XK :BD=AK:AD = KY ; DC.
( [TO. 14 and 62.]
Hence XY is bisected at K, and the proof proceeds as in Ex. 5.
7. Through P draw XPY par 1 to CQ, meeting AC in X and CB
produced in Y.
From the similar A B APX, AQC, we have AP :AQ= PX : QC ;
and from the similar A 8 PBY, QBC we have
BP: BQ=PY :QC.
But AP:AQ = BP:BQ. [Hyp]
PX : QC = PY : QC ; whence PX = PY.
Now ICPX—I PCQ=rt. l. [TO. 14.]
.'. the A B CPX, CPY are congruent. [TO. 4.]
■ PCX =L PCY.
Hence CP bisects Z.ACB internally, and .'. CQ, being perp. to
CP, bisects the Z.ACB externally.


8. OX. OY=OB z . [Ex. 2, p. 324.]
Hence the product OX. OY is always constant.
When Xis very near O, OX is very small, and OY is very
large, Y being infinitely remote when X coincides with O.
As OX increases, OY diminishes: and when OX = 08, OY = 08.
Thus as X moves from O to B, Y moves from ap infinite distance
towards B, ultimately coinciding with X at the pt. B.
Denoting the lengths of OX, OY by x and y, we have xy = 100,
and the resulting graph is a rectangular hyperbola whose
asymptotes are the axes of coordinates.
9. Through P and C draw PN, CM each par 1 to BD to meet AB
in N and M.
Then AB-PQ : PQ-CD=AN :NM [Th. 21.]

.'. PQ is the harmonic mean between AB and CD.

Page 327.
1. (i) Let A, P, B, Q be a harmonic range, and S the vertex
of the pencil. Through P draw aPb par 1 to SQ meeting
SA, SB at a and b.
Now AP;PB=AQ:QB. [Hyp.J
Alternately AP : AQ = PB : QB.
But from the similar A a APct, AQS
AP : AQ=«P: SQ ;
and from the similar A" BPi, BQS
PB :QB = 6P: SQ;
;. aP : SQ=6P : SQ,
.-. aP=bP.
Hence, as in Ex. 3, p. 263, it may be shewn that any trans-
versal a'p'b' par 1 to aPb (that is, par 1 to SQ) has equal
parts intercepted by the rays SA, SP, SB.


(ii) Conversely, let the pencil be cut by a transversal a'p'V
par 1 to SQ, so that a'p' = b'p it will be proved that the
pencil is harmonic.
As before, through P draw «P 6 par 1 to a'p'V (or SQ). Then
from the similar A“APa, AQS ;
AP : AQ = ciP : SQ.
And from the similar A a BPZ<; BQS,
PB : QB = 6P : SQ.
But since a'p' b'p' \_Hypj.']. aP = b
.'. aP : SQ=6P : SQ.
Hence AP : AQ=PB : QB.
Alternately AP : PB=AQ : QB,
or, A, P, B, Q is a harmonic range.
Note. As a second converse it may be shewn indirectly that
if the range is harmonic, and if in any transveral a’p’ = b'p',
then a'p'V is par 1 to SQ.
2. Let a harmonic pencil be formed by joining a point Sto the
harmonic range A, P, B, Q; then it will be proved that
any transversal is cut harmonically by this pencil.
Through P draw any transversal aPhq, and also the trans-
versal hPk par 1 to SQ.
Then by Ex. 1 (i), hP=kP.
Hence by Ex. 1 (ii) the range a, P, b, q is harmonic ; .'. any
transversal a'p'b'q' par 1 to aPbq is also cut harmonically.
[See Ex. 3, p. 263.]
3. (i) In the harmonic pencil {S, APBQ} let one ray SP bisect
the angle between the rays SA, SB ; it will be proved that
SP is perp. to SQ.
Through P draw aPb par 1 to SQ ; then since the pencil is
harmonic, «P =iP [ Ex. I].
Also in the AaS b, since SP bisects the vert. L, and aP = bP,
aS=bS. [ Th . 61.]
Hence the A a SPa, SP6 are identically equal, so that ab is
perp. to SP.
also SQ is perp. to SP. [Th. 14.]
K.S.G. 0


(ii) Conversely, in the harmonic pencil fS, APBQ} let PSQ be
a rt. angle ; it will be proved that SP, SQ are the internal
and external bisectors of the angle ASB.
As before, draw aPb par 1 to SQ, then aP —Pb [Ex. I], and
the L' S Pa, S Pb are rt. angles ; [Th. 14.]
hence the A“SPa, SPi are identically equal ; [Th. 4.]
.’. the l «SP=the u SSP.
That is, SP is the internal bisector of the Z.ASB ; and since
SQ is perp. to SP, .'. SQ is the external bisector.
4. Join SQ cutting the transversal apbq in q'.
Then {S, APBQ] is a harmonic pencil by definition ; hence,
a, p, b, q' is a harmonic range [Ex. 2],
but by hypothesis a,.p, h, q is a harmonic range,
the points q, q' coincide, since they divide ah externally in
the fixed ratio ap :ph. [Th. vi. p. 252.]
Hence SQ passes through q, or Q q passes through S.
5. Let Pp, BA, produced if necessary, meet at S. Join SA, SQ ;
and let SQ meet the transversal A pb at q'.
Then, as in the last example, {S, APBQ} is a harmonic pencil,
.’. A, p, b, q' is a harmonic range. [Ex. 2.]
But A, p, b, q is a harmonic range ; [//yp.]
.". q and q’ are coincident ; or, Q,q passes through S ;
that is, Pp, Bp, Qq are concurrent.
Similarly it may be shewn that Pq, Bb, Qp are concurrent.
6. Lemma. Take two straight lines intersecting at A, and in
one of them take any two points P, Q, and in tbe other
any two points p, q. Let Pp and Qq intersect at S, and
P q, Qp at S'; now it is proved in Ex. 5, that if B and b are
the harmonic conjugates of A with respect to P, Q and p, q
respectively, then B, b will lie on the fixed line SS'. Hence
it follows, if SS' intersects the given lines at B, b, that
A, P, B, Q and A, p, b, q are harmonic ranges.
Now let PQ qp be a quadrilateral, and let the sides QP, qp
meet at A, and the sides Pp, Qp at S. A complete quadri-
lateral will then be formed.


Let the diagonals P q and Q p intersect at S': then if SS' meets
PQ at B, the range A, P, B, Q is harmonic.
Let the diagonals P q, Qp meet the third diagonal SA at X
and Y; it is required to shew that SA is cut harmonically
at X and Y. Join S'A.
Then {S', APBQ} is a harmonic pencil ; therefore it cuts any
transversal (such as the third diagonal AS) harmonically.
That is, the range A, X, S, Y is harmonic.
Noth. The Lemma attached to this proposition furnishes a
simple linear construction for finding a fourth harmonic to
three points.

1. Draw any radius CP in the first ©, and a par 1 diam r P'C'P" in
the second O ; and measure the distance between the
points where PP', PP'' cut the line of centres.
Suppose S and S' to be these pts., S being the external pt.
Then CS : SC' = r : r' = 3'2 : 12 = 8 : 3,
and CS': S'C'=r :r'=B : 3.
Hence S, S' divide CC' externally and internally in the ratio
8:3.
.-. CS = —of 5-5 cm. = B'B cm.

and CB'=r—j of 5'5 cm.=4’o cm.

2. With the fig. of p. 329, taking CS=2 - 7", we have
C'S : SC =/:?• = 1-0:1-8 = 5 : 9.
.-. C'S =f of 2-7" = 1-5".

Also CS': S'C'=r :/ =9: 5.

.-. SS'- CS - CS' 1 -93''.


3. From the similar A 8 SCR, SC'P', we have
SR ; SP' = CP : C'P' = r ; /.
Also since CT, C'T' are par 1 , the A B SCT, SC'T' are similar ;
ST : ST' = CT : C'T'=r ;
SP ; SP' = ST : ST'.
Hence PT is par 1 to P'T'. [ Th. 60.]
z.SP'T' = i iSPT = /.STQ. [Th. 49.]
/. T, Q, P', r are concyclie. [Ex. 5, p. 163.]
.'. SP'. SQ =ST . ST. [Th. 58.]
Similarly SP. SQ' = ST. ST'.
.'. SP. SQ' = SP'. SQ = ST. ST'.
4. See Fig., p. 213. Here AB, AC produced are common tangents,
.'. A is one centre of similitude ; and since 81, 81, are the
internal and external bisectors of the l ABC, .'. the pencil
{B, AlYljf is harmonic. [Th. 61. Cor.]
/. r:r,= IA : I,A =IY : l x Y.
.'. Y is the other centre of similitude.
5. Taking the Fig. and the results of p. 217, we have from the
similar A*ASO, aNO,
SO ; NO = SA : Na
= circum-radius : nine-points-radius.
.'. O is the external centre of similitude of the two circles.
[E.r. 1, p. 328.]
Again from the similar A B ASG, XNG,
SG : GN =SA : NX
=ciroum-radius : nine-points-radius.
.'. Gis the internal centre of similitude of the two circles.
6. Let C, C' he the centres of the two fixed © s external to one
another, and O the centre of a variable © touching the
others at P, Q respectively. In the Fig. taken, the given
0“ are both external to the 0 (O). Then OC, OC' pass
respectively through P and Q. [Th. 48.]
Produce PQ to cut the © (C') at P', and join C'P'.
Then, since OP = OQ, and C'P'
;. _ OPQ - l OQP =vert. opp. _ C'QP' = l. C'P'Q.
.•. CP and C'P' are par 1 .


PP' passes through the external centre of similitude S.
If will be found that if the given 0 s are both external, or
both internal, to the variable ©, then PQ passes through
the external centre of similitude.
If one of the given 0 8 is within, and the other without the
variable O, it will be found that PQ passes through the
internal centre of similitude.
7. Let C, C' be the centres of the given circles, and X the given
point.
Take S the external centre of similitude, and let CC'S cut the
given 0“ between C, C' at M and N.
Join SX, and in SX (by describing a © through MNX) take a
point Y, such that
SX.SY = SM.SN.
By Ex. 3, p. 312, describe a 0 to pass through X, Y and to
touch the 0 (C) at P. This 0 will be proved also to touch
the O (O'). Let Obe its centre.
Let SP, produced if necessary, meet the 0 (O') at Q :
then SX. SY =SM. SN [tWr.] = SP, SQ. [Ex. 3, p. 329.]
.'. the 0 (O) passes through Q. [Ex. 6, p. 236.]
It remains to prove that (O) toucfies (O') at Q, that is, that
OQ, C'Q are in one line. Let SPQ meet the © (O') again
at P'; then since P, P' are corresponding points, CP is
par 1 to 0'?”; hence
z.OQP=z.OPQ=alt. IC'P'Q,=IC'Q,P' ;
but PQP' is one st. line, .'. OQC' is one st. line.
Since two 0 s can be drawn through X, Y to touch the © (C)
[Ex. 3, p. 312], it follows that there are two solutions of
the problem corresponding to the external centre of
similitude. Similarly there will be two more solutions
corresponding to the internal centre of similitude.
8. Let A, B, Cbe the centres of the given 0".
Take the general case when the O s are unequal and external
to one another. Let (A) be the least of the given O’-
From centre B, with radius equal to the difference of
the radii of (B) and (A) describe a O ; and from centre C
with radius equal to the difference between the radii


of (C) and (A), describe a ©. Then by the last exercise
describe a O to pass through A and to touch the two 0 s
of construction. Take O the centre of the last drawn O,
and join OA, cutting the O (A) at P. Then a O described
from centre O with radius OP will touch the three given
© s . The validity of this construction is apparent at once
on drawing the figure.
As each of the given © s may be touched by the required ©
either internally or externally, the required 0 may in
general be drawn in 2x2x2, or 8, ways.
The student will have no difficulty in investigating special
cases for himself.
9. Let r lt ? 2 , r 3 be the radii of the three ©".
(i) Let S 2 'C 2 , S 3 'C 3 intersect in O ; join CjO and produce it
to meet C 2 C 3 at X.
The A 8 C 2 OC 3 , CjOCj are on the common base OC 3 , and it
may be proved by similar triangles that
the alt. of A C 2 OC 3 ; the alt. of A 0,00, = C 2 S 3 ',; C t S 3
. A C 2 OC 3 C 2 S 3
A C;,OCj 0(8. /’j
Similarly
A C 2 OC 3 C 3 S 2 r z
,by multiplication, A C(OC 2 ; A C 3 OCj =r 2 : r 3.
But A CjOCg i A C 3 OCj C_X : C 3 X,
.'. C.,X;C 3 X =r 2 : r 3.
X coincides with 8/ ; hence Sj'C,, S 2 'C 2 and S 3 'C 3 are
concurrent.
(ii) To prove Si, S 2 ', S 3 ' collinear.
Join S 2 'S 3 ', and produce it to meet C 2 C 3 at Y.
Then C 2 C 3 , the external diagonal of the quad 1 is
divided harmonically at 8/ and Y [ Ex. 6, p. 327]:
hence Y, the harmonic conjugate-of 8/ with respect to C 2 C 3 is
coincident with S 3 ; or 8,, S 2 ', S 3 ' are collinear.
In the same way it may be shewn that each of the ranges
of points consisting of one external and two internal
centres of similitude are collinear, and also that the three
external centres are collinear.

1. Let O and Cbe the centres, and P the pt. of intersection of the
two circles.
Let PK be the tangent at Pto the O (O). Then OP is perp.
to PK [Th. 46], and is the tangent at Pto the O (C).
[Def. of Orthogonal O B .]
Hence the tangent at P to the © (C) passes through O.
Similarly the tangent at P to the O (0) passes through C.
2. As in Ex. 1, Z.OPC is a rt. L. OC 2 = OP 2 + PC 2 . \Th. 29.]
3. By Ex. 1, the req d locus is the tangent to the given O at
the given point.
4. Let Qbe the pt. through which the req d O has to pass, P the
pt. at which it has to cut the given O orthogonally, and O
the centre of the given O.
By the last Example the centre of the req d O lies on the
tangent at P to the given O.
By Prob. 14, it must also lie on the perpendicular bisector
of pa
The centre of the req d © is therefore determined.
Page 335.
1. Let A and B be the two given points, and let P be the
intersection of their polars. Then by the Reciprocal
Property of Pole and Polar, since the polar of A passes
through P,
the polar of P passes through A.
Similarly, since the polar of B passes through P,
the polar of P passes through B.
Hence the polar of P passes through both A and B ; that is,
AB is the polar of P.


2. Let Pbe the intersection of the given st. lines PQ, PR, and
let A and B be their poles;
Then since AB passes through A, .'. its pole lies on PQ the
polar of A.
Similarly since AB passes through B, .'. its pole lies on PR
the polar of B.
Hence the pole of AB is at P, the only point common to
PQ and PR.
3. The locus must be the polar of the given point A ; for by the
Reciprocal Property of Pole and Polar, (i) the pole of any
st. line through A must lie on the polar of A ; and (ii) any
point on the polar of A must be the pole of some st. line
through A.
4. Let Obe the common centre, P the point of contact of any
one of the tangents, and Q its pole : then since the tangent
is perp. to OP [7%. 46], Q must lie on OP (or OP produced),
and OP.OQ = the sq. on the radius of the given circle.
But this radius is constant, and OP is constant, .". OQ is
constant. Hence the locus of Qis a concentric circle.
5. Let PQ be a diameter of one of the ©“, and let Obe the
centre, and r the radius of the other. From O draw OT
touching the first O, and join OP cutting the first © at R.
Join QR.
Now OR . OP=OT 2 [Th. 58]
=r 2 , since the circles are orthogonal:
and QRP is a rt. l, being in a semicircle.
Hence QR is the polar of P: that is, the polar of P passes
through Q.
(5. Let P and obe the centres of the two ©* which intersect at
A, B : and let OP cut AB at Q. Join PA, PB.
Then since the ©• are orthogonal, PA and PB touch the © (O)
at A and B : hence OP. OQ = (radius) 2 [ Th. 66, Cor.].
And OP meets the chord of contact at rt. angles [Ex. 7, p. 177].'
.". AB is the polar of P with regard to the © (O).
7. Let A and B be the given points, and O the centre of the
given ©. Then since the polars of A and B are respectively
perp. to OA, 08, .'. one of the L s between the polars = the
aAOB [Ex. 8, p. 43].


8. Let Qbe the point inverse to P with respect to the given ©.
Draw OY perp. to AB ; and through Q, draw QX perp. to
OP, meeting OY at X.
Then since the u at Q and Y are rt. angles,
the points Q, X, Y, P are concyclic. [Th. 41, Com.]
OX.OY = OP.OQ [Th. 58.]
= * IHyp.]
But OY is constant, .'. OX is constant; that is, X is a fixed
point.
And since the L OQX is a rt. L [Const.], :. the locus of Q is a
circle on OX as diam. [Th. 41].
9. Let Q, be the point on OP inverse to P, and r the radius of
the © whose centre is O. Draw OX a diam. of the first ©.
Join PX, and draw QY perp. to OX.
Then OPX is a rt. L, being in a semicircle ;
and QYX is a rt. L by construction ;
.’. the points Q, Y, X, P are concyclic ; [Th. 41, Conv.]
OX.OY=OP.OQ=r 2 .
But since OX is constant, .’. OY is constant;
hence Y is a fixed point.
Therefore the locus of Q is the st. line perp. to OX through
the point inverse to X ; that is, the polar of X.
10. Let C and Dbe the points inverse to A and B respectively,
and let AX, BY be the perps. from A and B on the polars
of B and A. From A and B draw AM, BN perp. respec-
tively to OB and OA (produced if necessary).
Then OA .OC = 08. OD=r 2 . [Definition.]
And since the L’ at M and N are rt. L s , the points M, B, N, A
are concyclic,
.-. OA.ON = OB.OM. [Th. 58.]
By subtraction
OA. NC = OB.DM.
But NC = BY, and DM =AX. [Th. 21.]
.'. OA . BY =OB . AX.


11. Let RQ cut AD and BC at p and p. Then it was proved in
the solution of Ex. G, p. 327, that the ranges P, A, p, D
and P, B ,p\ C are harmonic.
Hence by the harmonic property of Pole and Polar, the polar
of P passes through both p and p : that is, RQ is the
polar of P. Similarly it may be shewn that PQ is the
polar of R. Hence by the reciprocal property of Pole
and Polar, PR is the polar of Q ; that is to say, the
A PQR is self-con jugate with respect to the circle.
12. Let Pbe the point whose polar with respect to a given circle
is to be found.
Through P draw PAD, PBC cutting the © at A, D and B, C.
Let BA, CD intersect at R ; and AC, BD at Q. Then, by
the last Ex., RQ is the polar of P.
If P is an external point, and RQ cuts the circle at T, T',
then clearly PT, PT' are the required tangents [Ex. 1,
p. 332],
13. Let PQR be a triangle self-conjugate with regard to a circle
whose centre is O. Then since QR is the polar of P,
.'. PC is perp. to QR [Def 2, p. 331].
Similarly RO is perp. to PQ, and consequently QO is perp. to
PR [I. p. 207]. That is, O is the orthocentre of the
A PQR.
14. Let A, P, B, Qbe a harmonic range, and O the centre of the
given O. Then by the reciprocal property of pole and
polar, the polars of the points A, P, B, Q are concurrent,
since they must all pass through the pole of the line AB.
And since these polars are respectively perpendicular to
OA, OP, 08, OQ, they must form a pencil whose rays
contain severally the same angles as the rays of the pencil
{O, APBQ (. But {O, APBQ} is a harmonic pencil [Hyp.
and Def. 2, p. 327], .'. the pencil formed by the polars is
also harmonic.

1. Let TT' be a common tangent to the two circles, and let their
Radical Axis cut TT' at P. Then, by Definition, the
tangential distances of the point P to the two 0 s are
equal : that is, PT = PT'.


2. Let Pbe any point on the Radical Axis; then the four
tangents drawn from P to the two circles are equal [/>/.].
Hence a © described from centre P with any one of these
tangents as radius will pass through all four points of
contact.
And since the radii drawn from P to the points of contact are
also tangents to the given circles, .’. the O whose centre
is P cuts the given O s orthogonally [p. 330. Def.\.
A. As in the last example, all tangents drawn from O to the
three O 8 are equal, .'. a circle from centre O with radius
OT will pass through all the points of contact. And
since the radii of this © drawn to the points of contact
are also tangents to the given © B , the © whose centre
is O cuts the given © 8 orthogonally.
*
4. Let the © 8 (A), (B), (C) touch one another two and two, and
let OT, OT be the common tangents Of the © 8 (A), (B)
and (A), (C) at their points of contact.
Then since OT and OT' are tangents to the O (A),
.-. ot=ot.
That is, tangents drawn from O to the © 8 (B), (C) are equal:
.'. Ois a point on the radical axis of the 0 s (B), (C).
But the radical axis of two 0 s which touch one another is
clearly the common tangent at their point of contact.
Hence the common tangent to the © 8 (B), (C) passes also
through O.
5. Take the figure of p. 208.
Since the L? BEA, BEC are rt. angles, .'. Q 8 described on
AB, BC as diams. pass through E [Th. 41] ;
that is, BE is the common chord of the 0 s on AB and BC.
Similarly AD and CF are respectively the common chords of
the © 8 on AB, AC and on BC, CA.
Hence 0, the point of intersection of the common chords, is
the radical centre [p. 337].
6. Let C be the centre of the given 0, and A the given fixed
point. Let DAT be any O passing through A, and cutting
the given O orthogonally at T. Join CA, and produce it,
if necessary, to meet the O DAT at B.


Then since the O* cut orthogonally at T, CT is a tangent to
the O DAT [Th. 46].
CB. CA = CT 2 . [Th. 58.]
But CA and CT are constant; CB is constant.
.". B is a fixed point, viz. the inverse of A with fespect to
the given O.
7. Since by the last Example all O s which pass through the
fixed point A and cut a given © orthogonally, pass also
through a second fixed point B (the inverse of A with
regard to the given O), .'. the locus of their centres is
the st. line bisecting AB at rt. angles.
To find this point B, draw any radius CT to the given © ;
describe a O to pass through A and touch CT at T.
Let this O cut CA at B. Then Bis the required point; for
CA.CB = CT 2 . [Th. 58.]
8., Let C be the centre of the given O, and A, D the given
points. Now by Ex. 6 all © a through A cutting the given
O orthogonally must pass through B the inverse point of
A with respect to the given O.
Determine B as in the last Example. Then the © circum-
scribed about the A ABD is that required.
9. Let Pbe the centre of any © which cuts the two given ©*
orthogonally at T and T'.
Then PT = PT, being radii.
Also PT and PT' are tangents to the given ©', since the ©”
are cut orthogonally.
Hence the locus of P is the radical axis of the two given ©■.
10. Let C and C' be the centres of the given © s , and A the given
point.
Then all 0 s through A cutting the © (C) orthogonally pass
through B the inverse of A with respect to the © (C);
and all ©" through A cutting the 0 (C) orthogonally pass
through B' the inverse of A with respect to the © (O').
Determine the points B and B' as in the solution to Ex. 7.
Then the 0 about the A ABB' is that required.
Note that by Ex. 9 the centre of this 0 is on the radical axis
of the given ©“ (C) and (C').


11. Let A, Bbe the centres of the two given ©•; PQ, PR tangents
to them from the given point P. Let the Radical Axis
cut AB at S.
Draw PM, PN perp. respectively to AB and the Radical Axis ;
and bisect AB at O.
Then AP 2 -BP 2 = 2A8.0M. [TA 56. Ex.]
And AQr - BR 2 = AS 2 - SB 2 [Ex. 1, p. 336.]
= 2AB. OS. [Th. 56. Ex.]
.•., by subtraction,
AP 2 - AQ 2 - (BP 2 - BR 2 ) = 2AB(OM - OS),
or PQ 2 - PR 2 =2AB.SM=2AB. PN.
12. Let A, Bbe the centres of two O a of the system, and let the'ir
Radical Axis cut AB at S. From P, any point in the
Radical Axis, draw tangents PQ, PR to the two © s ; then
PQ= PR [Hyp.]. From centre P, with radius PQ, describe
a © cutting AB at L, L'. Then it will be proved that
L, L' are fixed points for all positions of P.
From S draw tangents ST, ST' to the two © B .
Then SL 2 = PL 2 - PS 2 [Th. 29.]
= PQ 2 - PS 2
= PA 2 QA 2 - PS 2
= PS 2 + AS 2 - QA 2 - PS 2
=AS 2 - AT 2
= ST 2 .
But ST is independent of the position of P; . - . Lis a fixed
point.
Similarly SL' = ST' = ST —SL.
13. Let the radical axis cut the line of centres at S, and let
any ©of the system cut the same line at X, Y. If ST
is the tangent from S to this circle, then by definition
ST =SL = SL', where L, L' are the limiting points.
Also SL 2 = ST 2 =SX. SY, [Th. 58.]
;. L, X, L', Y form a harmonic range [Ex. 2, p. 324], since
S bisects LL'.


14. With the notation of the last Ex., since L, X, L', Y form a
harmonic range, .'. the polar of L with regard to any
circle of the system which cuts the line of centres at X, Y,
must cut this line perpendicularly at L' [Ex. 4, p. 334].
But L' is & fixed point [Ex. 12] ; /. the polar of L for aii
circles of the system is the same.
15. Let O, O' be the centres of two ©” which cut one another
orthogonally at T. Let AB, a diameter of the O (O), cut
the © (O') at P, Q.
Then OP. OQ = OT 2 = OB 2 ,
A, P, B, Q form a harmonic range. [Ex. 2, p. 324.]

.'. OQ' is the Geometric Mean between OP', OR'.
2. The inverse will be a st. line par 1 to the base of the A.
[Ex. 2, p. 341.]
3. Draw any line through O cutting the O ce at P and P'. Let
OT be the tangent from O to the O.
Invert with respect to the circle whose centre is O and radius
OT. Then since OP. OP' = OT 2 [Th. 58], the inverse of P
will be P': that is, the inverse of any point on the ©is
another point on the same 0. Hence the circle inverts
into itself.
4. The radius of the orthogonal circle is equal to the tangent
from its centre to the given circle. Hence, by Ex. 3, the
given circle inverts into itself.


5. Draw any other chord through O cutting the ©at P and P'.
Then since OP. OP' =OA. OB [7%. 57] = OA 2 , the inverse of P
will be P' and the O inverts into itself.
[Notice that in this case the inverse pt. P' is taken in OP
produced backwards. This kind of inversion is known as
Negative Inversion.']
6. By Ex. 1, p. 336, the tangents from any pt. Oon SP to the
two circles are equal. Taking this as radius of inversion,
we see by Ex. 3 that each circle inverts into itself.
7. By Ex. 2, p. 337, the tangents from the Eadical Centre of
three circles to each of the circles are equal.
Taking this point as centre of inversion and the tangent to
one of the circles as radius of inversion, we see by Ex. 3
that each circle inverts into itself.
8. Let the diameter of the O which is perp. to the given line cut
the O ce in O and Q', and the line in Q.
Let any other line through O cut the line in P and the
O ce in P'. Then since _OP'Q' = a rt. L [Th. 41] and
z.PQQ' = a rt. l [Const], the points P, P', Q', Q, are
concyclic, and OQ. OQ' = OP. OP'. Hence if we take
O as centre of inversion and k 2 = OQ.OQ' the given line
and the given © will each invert into the other. [Notice
that £ = dist. from O to the pt. of intersection of the line
and circle. Th. 66.]
9. Let A, B, C denote the three given circles. Invert with
respect to any point O on the circle S which cuts each of
the circles orthogonally [Ex. 3, p. 339].
Then by Ex. 3, p. 341 the inverse of A is another © A';
and by Ex. 2, p. 341 the inverse of S is a st. line S'.
But by Ex. 4, p. 342, Cor., the angle between the 0 A' and
the line S' is the same as the angle between A and S; that
is, is a rt. angle.
Hence the line S' is a diameter of the 0 A'.
Similarly S' is a diameter of B' and C'.
Thus the centres of A', B', C' are collinear.


10. Let Obe the centre of inversion and C the centre of the given
circle.
Then by Ex. 1, p. 340 the inverse of any diameter is a O
passing through O, and it must also pass through C', the
inverse of C.
Thus the diameters invert into a system of ©* passing through
O and O', that is, a co-axal system.
Again since the circle and any diameter cut at rt. L a , their
inverses must also cut at rt. L‘ \Ex. 4, p. 342. Cor.].
Hence each © of the co-axal system cuts the inverse of
the given © orthogonally.
11. Let obe the centre of inversion and P', Q', R' the inverse of
P, Q, R. Then, by Ex. 1, p. 340, the pts. P', Q', R' lie on
a circle through O.
2.2 p'n /
By Ex. 5, p. 342, we have PQ = Qp ; etc.
Hence the given relation becomes

OP.OQ' + OQ'.OR' OP'. OR'
which simplifies to
P'Q'. OR' + Q'R'. O P'=P'R'. OQ';
which is the same as Ptolemy’s Theorem on four concyclie
points \Th. 78].

(iii) Let D, E, F be the mid-pts. of the sides.
Then BD = DC, CE = EA, AF=FB.
Hence BD .CE.AF = DC . EA. FB.
the medians AD, BE, CF are concurrent.

4. BD : DC= A BAD : A CAD {Th. 70.]

Similarly CE : EA = CB 2 : BA 2 ;
and AF :FB = AC 2 : CB 2 .
, by multiplication, BD. CE. AF = DC. EA. FB.
Hence, by the converse of Menelaus’ Theorem, the pts. D, E, F
are collinear.
5. Take the figure and the results of p. 213.
We have, since AF = AE, and BF=BD, and CD = CE,
AF BD CE

6. Let the four st. lines EAB, EDC, FDA, FCB form the complete
quad 1 ABCDEF ; and let X, Y, Z be the middle points of
the diagonals BD, AC, EF.
Then X, Y, 2 will be proved collinear.
Take P, Q, R the middle points of EA, ED, AD.
Then from the AAEC, since P and Y are the middle points
of AE, AC,
/. PY is par 1 to EC, and outs AD at its middle point R.
Similarly PZ is par 1 to AF, and cuts ED at its middle point Q;
also QX is par 1 to EB, and cuts AD at R.
Hence QX, XR, PZ, ZQ, RY, YP are respectively halves of EB,
BA, AF, FD, DC, CE.
But the sides of the A EAD are cut by the transversal BCF,

Hence

X, Y, Z, points in the sides of the A PQR, are collinear.
[See Eouche et de Comberousse, TraiU de Oeome’trie, p. 205.]


7. Let the four lines EAB, EDO, FBC, FAD form the complete
quad l ABCDEF. Let AC cut BD in P and EF in Q. Let
BD, EF cut in R.
From the A CFE and the point A we have by Ceva’s Theorem,
FQ. ED.CB = QE. DC. BF.

From the A CFE and the transversal RBD, we have by

Hence EF is divided harmonically at Q and R.
Similarly by taking the A AFC with the pt. E and the trans-
versal BPD in turn we can shew that AC is divided
harmonically at R and P.
8. Let the A'ABC, A'B'C' be co-polar ; that is, let AA', BB', CC'
meet at S : then shall they be co-axial; that is X, Y, Z
the intersections of BC, B'C', of CA, C'A' and of AB, AB'
shall be collinear.

/. X, Y, Z are collinear.


Conversely, let X, Y, Zbe collinear; then shall AA', BB', CC'
be concurrent.
Let BB', CC' meet at 8.
Then the A“BZB', CYC' are co-polar ; hence by the first proof
they are co-axial; that is, A, A', 8 are collinear,
or AA', BB’, CC' meet at 8.
9. Let C ls C 2, C 3 be the centres of the three ©*, and r t , r.,, r 3
their radii. Let Si and 8/ be respectively the
and internal centres of similitude of the O s (C 2), (C 3), and
let S 2, S 2 ', S 3, S 3 ' have corresponding meanings.
To prove 8/, S 2 ' and S 3 collinear.
By definition We have

Hence from the A C 1 C 2 C 3 , the points 8/, S 2 ', S 3 are collinear.
\Menelaud Theorem , Converse .]
In the same way it may be shewn that each of the ranges of
points consisting of one external and two internal centres
of similitude are collinear, and also that the three external
centres are collinear.

1. Parallel lines must be .co-plannr.

4. (i) One perpendicular ; (ii) an infinite number of perpendiculars.
6. At the given point O make a right angle AOB. . If OB rotates
about OA as axis, then in all positions it will be perp. to
OA, and in one position it will also be perp. to the direction
from which it started. Thus we have three directions
each of which is perp. to the other two.
The second statement follows at once from Theor. 81.
7. Let Pbe any point on the O'". Join OP, AP. Then in all
positions of P the Z.AOP is a rt. angle [p. 348, Def. 8];
AP= + OA 2 [Th. 29.]

2. The crease is perpendicular to each of the two short edges, and
therefore perpendicular to the plane on which they rest.
[Th. 81.]
3. Place the spirit-level along any two intersecting lines 80, BD
(see Fig., p. 354); then, if these lines are found to be
horizontal, the vertical line through B is perp. to both, and
therefore perp. to the plane XY in which they lie [Th. 81].
That is, the plane XY is horizontal.
Consider the Fig. on p. 370, in which XY represents a hori-
zontal, and A BCD an inclined plane. Then the line of


section CD is horizontal; and all lines drawn pat 1 to CD
in the plane ABCD will also be horizontal. Thus in an
inclined plane there' can be a series of parallel horizontal
lines.
4. Let Qbe any point on the O ce - Then, as in Ex. 7, p. 353,

PA = PB = PC=PD.
(ii) Take X the middle point of AB ; then AX =OX = 10 cm.

1. Denote the set squares by AOB, A'O'B', the right angles being
at O and O'.
Place the set squares so that O and O' are at the given point,
and the edges 08, O'B' on the given plane (not in one
straight line): then bring together the edges OA, O'A'. A
straight rod laid along the coincident edges OA, O'A' will
evidently be perp. to the given plane.


2. Slide one edge of the set square containing the right angle
along BC until the perpendicular edge can be made to
pass through A: this determines the point D. (If the
perp. edge is not long enough to reach to A, it may be
prolonged by means of a straight rod.)
Use the set square to draw DE in the plane XY perp. to BC.
Now slide one edge containing the right angle along DE, until
the perpendicular edge can be made to pass through A:
this determines the point P.
Hence the position of the perpendicular AP is found.
3. The construction of Prob. 4, p. 74 must be performed in the
plane of ABC, and on the side of BC remote from A; this
would be inside the given solid.
In BC mark any two points B and C equidistant from A : this
can be done with compasses.
Bisect BC at right angles by DE ; this construction {Prob. 2,
p. 71) is to be done in the plane XY.
Then AD is perp. to BC, for the A 8 ADB, ADC are congruent.
[Th. 7.]
By the same method obtain P the foot of the perp. from A on
DE. Then AP is perp. to the plane XY.

it successively in any three positions oblique to the plane,
meeting the latter at the points A, B, and C.
Find S, the ciroum-centre of the A ABC. Then PS is the
required perpendicular.
4. Let Pbe the point at which the three given lines meet. From
these cut oif any three equal lengths, PA, PB, PC. Then,
as in Ex. 3, draw PS perp. to the plane ABC.
As before, the right-angled A 8 PSA, PSB, PSC are congruent;

6. Here PQ = l-40m., and QR = o'4Bm.
From the rt. angled A PQR, PR + QR 2
= 1-48 m.
Hence cos PRQ =~ = = 0'324.

7. Take X any point in PQ, and let XY,
drawn perp. to the plane AD, meet
the plane BC at Y.
To shew that Y lies in PR.
Join PY. Then by the Theorem of the
Three Perpendiculars [p. 357], YP is
perp. to AB. But PR is perp. to AB
[ Hyp ]; and YP is in the plane of
AB, PR.
.•. Yis a point in PR.
.'. XY lies in the plane QPR.
8. (i) Let A and Bbe the two given points, and P any point in
space equidistant from A and B.
Take X, the mid-point of AB; then XP is perp. to AB [p. 91].
Thus every point equidistant from A and B lies in some
line perp. to AB at its mid-point.
But all such lines lie in the plane passing through X perp. to
AB [p. 354, Cor.\
all points equidistant from A and B lie in this plane.
(ii) Let A, B, C be the three points (forming the vertices of a
triangle).
Then all points equidistant from A and B lie in the plane
perp. to AB through its mid-point.
And all points equidistant from A and C lie in the plane perp.
to AC through its mid-point.
.-. all points equidistant from A, B, and C must lie in the line
of section of the two planes mentioned.
By the method of Ex. 2, p. 361, it may be shewn that the
required locus is the perp. to the plane of the A ABC
through its ciroum-centre S.
(iii) This is worked out in full with a Figure on p. 426, the
proof there given involving nothing subsequent to
Theor. 85.
Page 362.
1. Consider the plane of the par 1 * AB, CD.
Because AB is equal and par 1 to CD,
.'. AC is equal and par 1 to BD. \Th. 20.]
Similarly it may be shewn that CE = DF, and EA=FB.
Hence the A" ACE, BDF are congruent. [7%. V.]


2. Let ABCD be a skew quad 1 . Draw the diag. BD.
Then the quad 1 consists of the A“ABD, CBD in two planes of
which the line of section is BD.
Let X, Y be the mid-points of AB, AD ; and let P, Q be the
mid-points of CB, CD.
Then XY is par 1 to BD [Ex. 2, p. 64], and PQ is par 1 to BD.
XY is pai' 1 to PQ. [Th. 86.]
Similarly XP is par 1 to YQ. XPQY is a par”'.
3. In the A ABC, lot AX be the perp. from Aon BC, and let the
triangle revolve about BC.
Then X is fixed , and in all positions AX is at right angles to
BC ; .'. AX generates a plane [p. 354, Cor.] : also AX is of
constant length. A describes a circle about X as centre.
4. The regular hexagon consists of six equilateral triangles : con-
sider one of these, namely A CAB.
Then OX is perp. to AB [Th. 7] ;
.'. PX is perp. to AB [p. 357, Cor.]
(i) PA = v'PO^+OA 2 = +l6

1. AB, CD, being both normal to the given plane, are par 1 to one
another; and, by hyp., they are equal; .'. AC, BD are
equal and par 1 . [Th. 20.]


Also, since AB is normal to the plane, the L ABD is a right
angle. the fig. ABDC is a rectangle.
2. Let AB, a normal to the plane, be fixed in position and magni-
tude ; and let C be any point whose perp. distance from
the plane is equal to AB.
Then, by Ex. 1, AC is perp. to AB. So that every point on
the required locus lies on some line through A perp. to
AB ; and conversely any point on any such line is at the
given distance from the plane. Now all such lines
generate the plane through A perp. to AB [p. 354, Cor.'],
namely the plane through A par 1 to the given plane. Hence
the required locus is a plane par 1 to the given plane.
3. See solution to Ex. 8, (i), p. 361.
Page 365.
1. If possible, let two planes (P) and (Q) passing through the
point A be both par 1 to a third plane (R).
Suppose the planes (P), (Q), and (R) to be cut by a plane (X)
which passes through A.
Then the lines of section of (X) with (P) and (Q) intersect at A ;
and, by Theor. 89, each of these lines must be par 1 to the
section of (X) with (R), which is impossible [p. 35].
2. Consider the Fig. of p. 364. Let the planes XY, PQ be par 1 ,
and let AB be normal to the plane XY. Cut the two
planes by any third plane through AB ; then the lines of
section are par 1 [ Th. 89], But, by hyp., AB is perp. to the
section in the plane XY ; hence it is also perp. to the sec-
tion in the plane PQ, and this section may be any line in
that plane. AB is normal to the plane PQ.
3. Let the planes (P) and (Q) be each par 1 to the plane (X); and
let any line normal to (X) cut that plane at A, and tlfe
planes (P) and (Q) at B and C. [ln the Fig. taken, (P)
and (Q) are on opposite sides of (X).]
Then because (R) is par 1 to (X), and the line BAC is normal to
X, /. BAC is also normal to (P). [Ex. 2.]
Similarly BAC is normal to (Q).
the planes (P) and (Q) are parallel. [Th. 88.]


4. Let (P) and (Q) be par 1 planes, and let the par 1 lines AB, CD
cut (P) at A and C, and (Q) at B and D.
Then AC, BD, being the sections made by the plane of AB, CD
with (P) and (Q), are par 1 [7%. 89]. the fig ABDC is a
par™. AB = CD.
5. Each plane of one pair will cut the other pair in two parallel
lines. Hence there will be four parallel sections in all.
Page 367.
1. Consider the Figure on p. 363. Here ABED, CBEF represent
the given intersecting planes, which are cut by the two
par 1 planes in the lines of section AB, DE, and BC, EF.
.'. DE is par 1 to AB, and EF is par 1 to BC. [7%. 89.]
.-. the L DEF = the Z. ABC. [7%. 87.]
An exceptional case arises when the par 1 planes are par 1 to
BE, the line of section of the intersecting planes. In this
case the four lines of section are par 1 .
2. Let A and B be , the two given fixed points. Then the locus
of points in space equidistant from A and B is the plane
perp. to AB through its mid-point [Ex. 8, (i), p. 361].
Hence the required point is that in which the given
straight line cuts this plane.
The construction is impossible when the given line is parallel
to the above mentioned plane.
Page 369.
1. Let ah be the projection of AB on the plane XY [Fig. 2, p. 368],
and let AB be par 1 to the plane XY. Then AB, being par 1 to
• the plane XY, can never meet ah which lies in that plane.
Moreover AB and ah are in 'the same plane AB6ct [Th. 92].
.'. AB and ah are par 1 .
2. Take the Fig. of p. 369.
(i) When AB is par 1 to the plane XY, the fig. AB&a is a par' 11 ,
for A a and Bh are par 1 , being both perp. to the plane XY ;
so that ah —AB.


(ii) When AB is perp. to the plane XY, then 86, A a become
one line , namely BA produced ; so that a and 6 coincide,
and consequently ab = 0.
(iii) If the angle a = 60°, the A BA5' becomes half an equi-
lateral triangle, so that A V is half of AB.
ab=i. AB.
Otherwise : the angle a = 60°;
.'. a 6 =AB cos 60° =AB x h
3. Consult the Fig. of p. 360.
Here AB is the perp. from A on the plane XY, so that BC, BD
are the projections on that plane of the obliques AC, AD.
Then, if AC=AD, the right-angled A s ABC, ABD are congruent
[7%. 18]; .-. BC = BD.
4. Take the Fig. of Theor. 92, p. 368.
Suppose another line A'B' to be drawn par 1 to AB, and let a'V
be the projection of A'B'.
Then 86, B'6' are par 1 , both being perp. to the plane XY
[Th. 83, Conv.\ Hence the plane of AB, B 6 is par 1 to the
plane of A'B', B'6' [Th. 90] ; and the projections ab, a'V are
the lines in which these planes are cut by the plane XY.
ab, a'V are par 1 . [Th. 89.]
The exceptional case is when AB, A'B' are perpendicular to the
given plane.
5. Let BA meet its projection B'A' produced at P; and let DC
meet D'C' produced at Q.
Then BP, DQ are par 1 [llypi] ; BB', DD' are par 1 [Th. 83, Conv.\
and .’. PB', QD' are par 1 [Ex. 4] ;
;. l BPB'=i. DQD'=a (say). [Th. 87.]
But A'B'=AB cos a ; and C'D' =CD cos a. [Th. 92, Cor. 2.]
■ AB = _J^ = CD .

Page 371.
1. (i) is true ; (ii) is false.
To prove (i), let PQ be par 1 to AB, and let AB be par 1 to the
plane XY; also let the plane of the par 1 ’ PQ, AB cut the
plane XY in the line CD [Fig. p. 370],
Then AB is par 1 to CD [Th. 93, Conv.] ;
PQ is par 1 to CD [Hyp. and Th. 15] ;
PQ is par 1 to the plane XY, which contains CD [Th. 93.]
2. AB generates a plane par 1 to the given plane XY-
Let a be the projection of the fixed point A on the plane XY ;
and let ah be the projection of AB in any one of its
positions.
Then hah is a right angle ; and AB, ah are par 1 [Th. 93, Conv.] ;
aAB is a right angle, and Aais a fixed line. Hence AB
generates a plane [Th. 82, Cor.]. And this plane is par 1 to
the plane XY ; for every point in the former lies in some
line through A par 1 to the latter.
3. Let the two intersecting planes ABYX,
CDYX pass respectively through the
par 1 lines AB, CD ; and let XY be their
line of section.
Since AB is par 1 to CD, it is also par 1 to
the plane CDYX which passes through
CD [Th. 93].
■ Hence the plane ABYX, which passes
through AB, cuts the plane CDYX in C
a line par 1 to AB [Th. 93, Con.].
That is, the line of section XY is par 1 to AB, and consequently
also par 1 to CD.
4. Let PQ be par 1 to each of the planes ABYX, CDYX, of which
the line of section is XY.
Through PQ take a plane cutting the plane ABYX in ah, and
the plane CDYX in cd ; then ah, cd are each par 1 to PQ
[Th. 93, Com.], and therefore par 1 to one another.
Hence, by Ex. 3, XY is par 1 to ah and cd, and therefore to
PQ [Th. 86].
5. Through P draw PX, PY par 1 respectively to AB, CD.
Then AB and CD are both par 1 to the plane of XPY ; for each
is par 1 to a line (PX or PY) in that plane [Th. 93],


6. Let AB, CD be the two skew lines.
In AB take any point P, and in CD take any point Q.
Through P draw a line PX par 1 to CD ; and through Q draw
a line QY par 1 to AB.
Then the plane of AB, PX is par 1 to the plane of CD, QY
[Th. 90].
Page 375.
1. Consider the Fig. of Theor. 92.
Let AB be the given line, and XY the given plane.
In AB take any point P, and let Pp be the perp. from Pon the
plane XY.
Then the plape through AB, Pp is perp. to the plane XY
{Th. 95].
2. Let (X) and (Y) be par 1 planes ; and let a line ABC cut (X) at B,
and (Y) at C.
From a point A in the given line let AP be drawn perp. to the
plane X ; and let AP (or AP produced) cut the plane (Y) at
Q. Then APQ is normal to the plane (Y) [Ex. 2, p. 365] ;
and the angles at which the line ABC cuts the planes (X)
and (Y) are measured by the U ABP, ACQ.
Now the plane of ABC, APQ cuts the par 1 planes (X), (Y) in
the lines BP, CQ ; .". BP is par 1 to CQ [7%. 89] ; .'. the
corresponding - ABP, ACQ are equal.
3. Let the plane (C) cut the par 1
planes (A) and (B) in the lines
PQ, P'Q'; then PQ, P'Q' are
par 1 [7%. 89].
Suppose the three planes (A),
(B), (C) to be cut by a plane
perp. to PQ, and consequently
perp. to P'Q' [ Th . 83] ; and let
the sections of this plane with
the planes (A), (B), (C) be XY,
X'Y', ZXX' respectively.
Then XZ, XY are perp. to PQ
[Def. 8, p. 348], and X'Z, X'Y'
are perp. to P'Q'; so that the
dihedral angles between the planes (A), (C) and (B), (C)
are measured by the U ZXY, ZX'Y'. But XY is par 1 to X'Y'
\Th. 89];
.. ZXYZX'Y', [Th. U.]


4. (i) The dihedral angle (a) be-
tween the plane ABC'D' and
the floor is measured by the

5. Let Obe the in-centre of the square, and X the mid-point of
AB. Then OX is evidently perp. to AB.
Also OP=24", OX = 7", and PX=VOP 2 +OX 2 =25";
cos OXP = 2 '.= 0-2800.
Page 379.
1. Call the three planes (A), (B), (C).
Let the section of the planes (A) and (B) be XX', and the sec-
tion of the planes (A) and (C) be YY'. Then XX' and YY',
being both in the plane (A), will in general meet at some
point O. So that Ois a point common to the planes (B)
and (C), and therefore lies in the line of section of those
planes. In other words the three lines of section are
concurrent; hence the planes meet at a point.
Exceptional cases : (i) When the three planes are par 1 .
(ii) When two planes are par 1 , and are cut by the third.
(iii) When the sections of the planes (A) and (B) and of the
planes (A) and (C) are •parallel; in which case all three
lines of section are parallel.
2. Let ABCD be a skew quadrilateral. Join BD, thus dividing
the quadrilateral into two triangles not in the same plane.
Then Z.A +/.ABD +/-ADB = 180°;
also z.C+,ICBD-t-.LCDB = 180°.
Hence I A+ I C + (l ABD + _CBD)+(z. ADB +I CDB) =36O°.


But in the solid angle at B, ABD+Z.CBD is greater than the
z. ABC, namely the z. Bof the quadrilateral. [Th. 97.]
And in the solid angle at D, Z.ADB+Z.CDB is greater than
the z. ADC, namely the z. D of the quadrilateral.
Hence Z.A+Z.C+Z.B + Z.D is less than 360°.
3. (i) Z.AOX +L. BOX is greater than l AOB [Th. 97.]
L BOX + Z. COX is greater than L BOC
Z.COX + Z.AOX is greater than Z.COA.
Hence, by addition, twice the sum of the z." AOX, BOX, COX
is greater than the sum of the U AOB, BOC, COA.
(ii) Let OY be the common section of the planes AOB, COX.
Then Z.COB + Z.BOY ia greater than/.COY [Th. 97] ; to each
add Z.YOA.
Then Z.COB + Z. BOA is greater than Z.COY + Z. YOA.
But i_YOA+Z-YOX is greater than Z.AOX [Th. 97] ; to each
add l. COX.
Then L COY +L YOA is greater than z. COX + L AOX.
A fortiori Z:COB + z_BOA is greater than Z.COX+Z.AOX.
(iii) It has been proved that
z. AOX +z. COX is less than z. AO B +z. BOC ;
similarly L BOX +z. AOX is less than z. BOC+z. COA ;
and Z.COX+Z. BOX is less than Z.COA +^AOB.
Hence, by addition, twice the sura of the zz’ AOX, BOX, COX
is less than twice the sum of the z.‘AOB, BOC, COA.

1. Let AB be an oblique, and AP the
perp. drawn from a point A

the projection of AB on that
plane.
Let BQ be any other line through
B in the plane XY.
To prom that Z.ABP is less than •
z_ABQ.
Make BQ equal to BP, and join AQ.
Then the perp. AP is less than the oblique AQ [ Th. 85].
And in the A“ABP, ABQ, we have AB, BP equal to AB; BQ
respectively, but AP less than AQ ;
l. ABP is less than z_ABQ. [Th. 19, Com .]

2. It will be shewn that the line of greatest slope is perp. to the
line in which the given plane cuts a horizontal plane.
Consider the Fig. of p. 381.
Let C be the given point in the plane BD, which cuts a
horizontal plane in the section AB. Let CB be perp., and
CA oblique to AB ; and let CE be perp. to the horizontal
plane. Join EB, EA. Then the angles which CB, CA
make with the horizontal plane are measured by the
U CBE, CAE.
To prove /.CBE greater than Z.CAE.
It may be shewn, as on p. 357, Cor., that EB is perp. to AB.
.'. EA is greater than EB. [77i. 12.]
From EA cut off EX equal to EB, and join CX.
Then the A“CEB, CEX are congruent [77;. 4]; so that the
Z. CBE = the z. CX E.
But the ext. Z.CXE is greater than the bit. opp. /.CAE ;
.'. L CBE is greater than L. CAE.
3. Let AB be any line through Oin the plane XY ; let PQ be the
perp. from P on that plane, and PR the perp. on AB.
Required the loans of R.
Join QR ; then QR is perp. to AB [see solution of Kx. 5, (ii),
p. 361].
Now Q and O being fixed points, and the /.QRO being a right
angle, it follows that the locus of R is a circle on QO as
diameter.
4. (i) Let XYE, XYF be the two planes cutting in the line XY ;
and let BP, BQ be the lines of section of these two planes
with the plane of AP, AQ.
Then since AP is perp. to the plane XE, .'. the plane of AP, AQ
is also perp. to the plane XE \Th. 95].
Similarly the plane of AP, AQ is perp. to the plane XF.
Hence the jilane of AP, AQ, being perp. to the planes XE, XF,
is perp. to XY their line of section \Th. 96].
(ii) Since XY is perp. to the plane of APBQ, .'. BP, BQ are
perp. to XY ; so that the dihedral angle between tlie given
planes is measured by the l. PBQ, which is equal or supple-
mentary to the l PAQ, since the U at P and Q are right
angles.


5. (i) The three points A, B, and D are co-planar. Now if AC
and BD were co-planar, then C would be in the plane of
A, B and D ; in which case AB and CD would be co-planar,
which is contrary to hypothesis.
(ii) As on p. 371, Cor., it may be shewn that two parallel
planes may be passed one through each of two skew lines
AB, CD. Then the projections of AB, CD on any plane
perpendicular to the two parallel planes will be parallel.
6. Let AB, CD be the two skew lines, and P any point in space.
Pass a plane through P and AB, and a second plane through P
and CD. Since these planes have the point Pin common,
they cannot be par 1 ; and hence they intersect in a line
through P.
This line of section being in the plane of P, AB, and also in
the plane of P, CD, will in general intersect both AB and
CD.
An exceptional case arises when the line of section is par 1 to
either AB or CD.
7. (i) AO is perp. to the plane of 08, OC [Th. 81], and OX is
perp. to BC in that plane ;
.'. AX is also perp. to BC [ Theor. of Three Perps., p. 357].
Similarly BY, CZ are perp. respectively to CA, AB.
.-. XYZ is the pedal triangle of the A ABC.
(ii) Produce AP, BP, CP to meet BC, CA, AB respectively at
X, Y, Z.
Then, as before, AO is perp. to the plane of 08, OC ;
.’. the plane AOXP is perp. to the same plane [ Th. 95],
Again the plane AOXP, which passes through OP is perp. to
the plane ABC [Th. 95].
BC, the section of the planes OBC, ABC, is perp. to the
plane AOXP [77*. 96].
AX is perp. to BC.
Similarly BY, CZ are respectively perp. to CA, AB ;

Then N' is the mid-point of ON \Th. 92, and Th. 22 Cor.],

(iii) By Theor. 93, the required plane must pass through OP
and some line par 1 to BQ. This condition is satisfied by
the plane of OP, OA, namely the plane OAPR.
The shortest distance between BQ and OP = the perp. from
any point in BQ on the plane OAPR [ Th. 94] ; and this is
equal to the perp. from B on OR.
Let BX be the perp. from B on OR.
Then BX. OR-2AOBR = 08. BR ;
or BX. s!h' 1 -\-c l = bc ;
.'. BX = hcjsjb-‘ + <?.
3. The cutting plane intersects each pair of opposite faces in
par 1 lines [Th. 89]; hence the lines of section, being
coplanar, form a par 1 ".
4. Consider the Fig. on p. 396, where the prism (ABODE,
A'B'C'D'E') is cut by par 1 planes in the polygons kbcde,
k'b'c'd'e.
Now the lateral edges of the prism are all par 1 ; and, by
Theor. 89, the plane of the face DCC'D' cuts the given
par 1 planes in the par 1 lines dc, d'c'.
Thus the sides of kbcde are respectively par 1 and equal to the
sides of k'b'c'd'e’.
Hence the angles of kbcde are respectively equal to the angles
of k'b’c’d'e 7 [Th. 87].
.'. the polygons are congruent.
5. Of the six edges of the tetrahedron, two will be equal to a,
two -to b, two to c ; and, on drawing the Fig., it will be
«een that each triangular face will have the sides a, b, c ;
thus all the faces are congruent. Moreover the plane
angles at each corner are those opposite respectively to
edges a, b and c ; that is to say, the angles are equal to
those of one triangular face. Hence their sum is 180°.
6. The diameter of the circle par 1 to the section of the two given
planes will have a projection equal to itself, viz. 5 cm. ;
and this will be the greatest chord of the projected curve.
Projected area = (given area) x cos 45°

Examples 7-10, and kindred exercises on the tetrahedron, are most
simply solved by passing parallel planes through each pair
of opposite edges [Ex. 6, p. 371]. The siv planes so drawn
form an enclosing parallelepiped, of which opposite faxes
have opposite edges of the tetrahedron as diagonals. This
is represented in the diagram given below, where (A, BCD) is
the given tetrahedron. (In practice it is easier to draw the
enclosing parallelepiped first, and the tetrahedron after-
wards.)
7. In the above diagram, let a plane par 1 to AC, BD (that is, par 1
to the opposite faces ARCP, QBSD of the par' 1 ) cut the
edges AB, BC, CD, DA of the tetrahedron in the points
E, F, G, H.
Then because AC is par 1 to the given cutting plane, and
because the plane ACB meets the cutting plane in EF,
EF is par 1 to AC. ’ [Th. 93, Ctm.]
Similarly HG is par 1 to AC. .'. EF and HG are themselves
par 1 \Th. 86].
Similarly FG and EH are par 1 .
8. In the above diagram, if the tetrahedron is regular, then all
the diagonals of the faces of the enclosing parallelepiped
are equal. Hence these faces are equal squares, and the
parallelepiped becomes a cube.
Now the opp. edges AC, BD of the tetrahedron lie in the par 1
planes- ARCP, QBSD ; hence the shortest distance between
AC, BD is equal to the perp. distance between these planes,
viz. BR.


Thus in the square BRAQ,
BR = [Ex. 13, p. 124.]
= £ of AB. \/2
= J (diag. of sq. on side AB).
9. In the same diagram, if AC, BD are at right angles, then in
each of the equal and opp. par ms ARCP, Q.BSD, the two
diags. are at right angles ; hence each of these par ms is
equilateral. AP=AR.
Similarly, if AB, CD are at right angles, each of the par ms
AQBR, PDSC is equilateral. .'. AQ=AR.
.-. AP =AQ = AR.
Hence the par m ” APDQ, RCSB are equilateral; so that their
diags. are at right angles.

Join BP, CP, DP, and produce them to meet the sides of
the base in X, Y, Z.
Then from the rt. angled A “APB, APC, APD, we have
PB = PC=PD. [Th. 18.]
And from the A* PBC, PBD, the L PBC=the L PBD. [Th. 7.]
Lastly from the A“XBC, XBD, we have XC=XD. [Th. 4.]
Hence BX is a median of the base ; similarly CY, DZ are
medians, and P divides each of them in the ratio 2:1.
[p. 97, 111. Cor.]
9. Let AP, BQ be the perp“ from A and B on the opp. faces of
the tetrahedron : then BP, AQ meet when produced at X
the mid-point of CD. [Ex. B.]
Hence AP, BQ, AX, BX are co-planar ; so that a line PL, drawn
par 1 to BQ, must meet AX, and be perp. to the face ACD.
[Th. 83.]
Thus from the similar A’ BQX, PLX,
BQ : PL =BX : PX = 3 ; 1 [p. 97, Cor.]

(ii) Take the Fig. given on p. 246 of the Key.
Let (A, BCD) be a tetrahedron. Pass pairs of par 1 planes
through the opposite edges, thus enclosing the tetrahedron
in the parallelepiped (BROS, QAPD), of which opp. faces
have opp. edges of the tetrahedron as diagonals.
Now the line which joins the mid-points of AC, BD (that is,
the common perp. to AC, BD) is equal to AQ, a common
perp. to the opp. faces ARCP, QBSD of the par d . •
Similarly the line joining the mid-points of AB, CD, and
that joining the mid-points of AD, BC are respectively
equal to AP and AR.
Now AC 2 + BD 2 = sum of sqq. on diags. of par m ARCP

Similarly AB 2 + CD 2 = 2[AR 2 + AQ 2 ];

By addition, sum of sqq. on edges of tetrahedron

Hence the lines of section of the cutting plane with the faces

4. The greatest cone will obviously have its vertex in the face
opposite to that in which the base lies. And the base of
the cone will be the circle inscribed in the square base of

the segments of h made by the cutting plane are in the

7. The cone has a base of radius 0 - 7 cm., and its slant height
is 2'6 cm.
The whole surface required consists of
(i) the circular top, (ii) the curved surface of the cylinder,
(iii) the slant surface of the cone.

9. Let v and Vbe the volumes of oil and water respectively.
Then r+V is the volume of the whole outer cone. Also

outer and inner radii are 4 cm. and 3 cm. respectively.
The two cones have base of radius 3 cm. and slant height 5 cm.
Curved surface of cylinder=2x x 4 x 10 sq. cm.
Surface of two ends =2x tt (4 2 3 2 ) = 14? r sq. cm.
Surface of two cones = 2 x tt x 3 x 5 = 30tt sq. cm.
Thus the whole surface = 124tt = 389 - 56 sq. cm.

1. In the Fig. of p. 424, let O be the common centre of two
spheres whose radii are ON and OA, and let ON—rj, and
OA=*V
Now the tangent plane to the inner sphere at the point N is
perp. to ON [Art. 39, p. 424], and cuts the outer sphere
in the circular section QPR, of which N is the centre, and
NP a radius;
also NP=VOP 2 —ON 2 = •Jr.? — constant,
for any point N on the surface of the inner sphere.
2. Let Obe the centre of a sphere of radius r, and X any point
on the surface at a given distance a from the fixed point
P. Then the AOXP is of fixed size and shape for all
positions of X ; and if the AOXP revolves about OP as
axis, the vertex X passes through all points on the surface
at' the given distance a from P. Now if a triangle revolves
about its base, the vertex moves in a plane, and
describes a circle [Ex. 3, p. 362].
3. The spheres touch, if r+r’ —a.
The spheres cut, if r+ r’ > a, and r~ r < a.
If the spheres cut, let O and O' be their centres, and P a point
common to the two surfaces. Then, the A OO'P being of
fixed size and shape, it may be shewn, as in the last Ex.,
that the locus of P is a circle.
4. Let TP be a tangent from the ex-
ternal point T to the sphere
■whose centre is O. Join OT, OP.
Then the Z.OPT is a rt. L. And
if the A OPT revolves about OT
as axis, the point P moves in a
circle [Ex. 3, p. 362], and on the
surface of the sphere, for OP is
its radius.
Now in all positions the L OPT is a
rt. L ; hence in all positions TP is
a tangent to the sphere. Hence
an infinite number of tangent
lines can be drawn from T v and
the locus of their points of con-
tact is a circle.
The tangent TP, as it revolves, generates the curved surface
of a cone.


5. This Exercise depends on the following extension of Theor. 41.
By rotating the Fig. of p. 164 about the diameter AB, it is
immediately seen that a diameter AB of a sphere subtends
a right angle at any point on the surface. Hence it follows
that the locus of a point in space at which a fixed line AB
subtends a right angle is the surface of a sphere.
In Ex. 5 let 0 be the centre of the given sphere, A the given
fixed point, and P the centre of the circular section made
by any plane through A. Then OP is perp. to this plane ;
and the £.APO is a rt. angle. Hence P moves on the
surface of the sphere having the fixed line OA as diameter.
If A is within or on the surface of the given sphere, the re-
quired locus is the whole surface of the sphere on the
diam r OA; but if Ais outside the given sphere, the locus
of P is that part of the surface of the sphere on OA which
falls within the given sphere. [Compare Ex. 6, p. 165.]
6. From O draw OA perp. to the given plane ; and let the circle
through Q, P, A cut OA at B.
Then OA. OB=OP. OQ [Th. 58.]
=constant; [ Hyp. ]
/., since OA is fixed, OB is also fixed.
And because A, B, Q, P are concyclic, and the L at A is a rt. L,
:. the /lQ is a rt. l. [Th. 41.]
Hence the fixed line OB subtends a rt. angle at Q, a point in
space;
.’. the locus of Q is the surface of a sphere on OB as diam r .
[Ex. 5.]
7. Let (A, BCD) be the given tetrahedron.
Consider the planes which bisect the three dihedral angles
whose edges are BC, CD, DB. These three bisector-planes
must meet at some point O [Ex. 1, p. 379], which will be
the centre of the inscribed spherei
It is easily seen that the locus of points equidistant from two
given intersecting planes is the plane which bisects the given
dihedral angle.
Hence it follows that the point O is equidistant from the six
faces of the tetrahedron, and therefore the centre of the
inscribed sphere.
The centre of an escribed sphere is found by bisecting externally
the dihedral angles whose edges are those of one face of the
tetrahedron. As this process maybe performed on each
face, there are four possible escribed spheres.


8. In the Fig. of p. 387, suppose (A, BCD) to be a regular tetra-
hedron. Then, by symmetry, Gis clearly the centre both
of the inscribed and circumscribed sphere ;
and AG =R, also Gg I =r.
So that R = 3r. [Art. 12, p. 387.]
Now supposing the A BCD equilateral, each edge being 2a,
we have
BX = aV3 [Ex. 14, p. 124], and Bg,=^ . nVii. [p. 97.]
Also Ag I —s?Aß- - = 2 - —=2(t'\|.
Now AG (or R) = ?Asq [Art. 12, p. 387.]
=i- 2a V| = i^-
9. It has been shewn [see solution of Ex. 5] that the locus of
points in space at which a fixed line subtends a right angle
is the surface of the sphere having the fixed line as
diam r . And since in this problem the points are also to
lie in a given plane, their locus will be the line of section
of the plane and the sphere, that is to say, a circle.
10. This follows from the fact that tangent lines drawn to a sphere
from an external point are equal.
Let (A, BCD) be a tetrahedron in which a sphere is placed so
as to touch the edges AB, AC, AD at the points P, Q, R
respectively, and the edges CD, DB, BC at the points
X, Y, Z.
Then AB+CD=(AP+BP)+(CX + DX)
= AQ+BY +CQ+DY
=(AQ+CQ)+(BY + DY)
= AC + BD.
