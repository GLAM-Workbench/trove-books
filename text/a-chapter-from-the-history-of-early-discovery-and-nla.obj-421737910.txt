EARLY DISCOVERY AND COLONISATION
OE AUSTRALIA.
(By A. C. MACDONALD, F.8.G.5., F.E. Hist. Soc. England,
&c., &c.)
(Read before the Australian Church Literary Society.)
Mr. President, Ladies, and Gentlemen,
I think I may say, without fear of contradiction, that
the History of the Early Discovery and Colonisation of Australia is
associated in the minds of a large majority, both young and old, with
all that is unromantic, dry, and uninteresting.
In the short time at my disposal to-night I will endeavour to
remove such a misconception. I can, however, give but a mere
outline —one chapter out of many of the History of the Discovery and
Settlement of this great Australian Continent; it is simply impossible
to crowd all the known facts and speculations into a single lecture.
My chief difficulty has been to keep my paper within reasonable
limits, and at the same time to give a connected narrative of events.
It is a common complaint that Australia is a land without a past—
that it is almost the only spot on earth where the primitive aboriginal
man left no traces behind him ; and though it is the oldest of all old
continents, it has neither ruins nor traditions, nor any passing
memory of the old lost ages. It has frequently been asserted that the
country is happy which has no history; and as Australia starts with
less history than any other land upon this earth, there should be a
prospect of unlimited bliss in its future.
A halo of mystery surrounds the early discovery of this great conti-
nent of ours well worth our attempt to unravel, and there is a
fascination in the study of the subject that will well repay careful
and patient investigation.
The existence of Southern Continent” was no doubt y
suspected far back in hundred years before thg Christian /far
Strabo; a century later, Pomponius Melo ; the first, y
ana - Claudius Ptolemy in the second century—all refer to a “Terra
Australis Incognita.” A Greek tradition also existed of a “ Great
South Land,” and this tradition lived long in the minds of the old
sea-kings of fifteen centuries ago, many of whom, doubtless, embarked
in their frail crafts for this wonderland, and so vanished for ever
from human sight, engulfed in the merciless ocean ; or, perhaps,
some of these hardy mariners, after braving the dangers of the
mighty deep, and having landed, fell a prey to a hostile tribe.
Many a gallant vessel doubtless sailed from ports of the old world in
search of new oceans and new worlds, and was heard of no more.


Within the recollection of some of the early Western District
settlers, the wreck of a ship was visible on our own Victorian
southern coast—the trace of some long-forgotten expedition despatched
in search of the new world since founded upon this great continent of
Australia—and during the present year a search party was formed at
Belfast to unearth, if possible, what remains, buried deep beneath the
sand-drifts, of the wreck of probably centuries ago.
Mr. George Collingridge, of Sydney, has placed us under deep obli-
gation by the publication of his monograph “ Early Discovery of
Australia,” in which he gives a description of some ancient charts
supposed to represent “ Terra Australis,” and their significance in
connection with the discovery of this continent. His object has been
to show that Australia, Tasmania, and probably New Zealand, were
discovered by the Portuguese and Spaniards prior to the year 1536,
and that the Dutch have no claim to priority of discovery, as has been
supposed, since their predecessors in the field were nearly a century
before them.
Those of my audience who care to read Mr. Collingridge’s paper
will find it published in full, with reduced copies of the original
charts which he refers to in proof of his contention, in the Illustrated
Sydney News of the 7th and 21st June, and sth July, 1890.
The Dutch, we know, discovered—or, according to Mr. Colling-
ridge, re-discovered—Australia in the year 1606 ; and this is really
the first authentic record that we at present have.
For centuries the geography of Europe was limited to a small circle
lying immediately around the Mediterranean. This map of the world
shows the extent of the known globe in the days of Herodotus, in the
fifth century b.c., and forms but a very small part of the world as we
now know it.
As the art of navigation improved, this circle was widened. In the
latter part of the fifteenth century the mariner’s compass found its way
from China to Europe ; it then became possible to venture upon the
ocean far out of sight of land.
When Borne began to rule the world, the Greeks had made great
progress in geography. At the close of the dark ages, during which
geography practically ceased to exist, the spirit of discovery was
re-awakened; the adventurous navigators of Sweden and Norway
crossed to Iceland ; Greenland, and the mainland of North America
were discovered about the end of the tenth century.
These discoveries were, however, soon forgotten, and for hundreds
of years little advance was made in geographical science or discovery.
For ages the civilised world remained in ignorance of the existence
of these southern latitudes. The spirit of solitude brooded in silence
over the Australian continent; thick clouds alike veiled the fair land-
scapes, the lofty mountain peaks, the fertile plains and valleys, and
sunny, smiling skies —clouds which did not roll away until early in
the sixteenth century.
But although no documentary evidence has yet been brought to
light proving, beyond doubt, the certain discovery of this South Land
in the early part of the fifteenth century, we find, on the old charts of
the world already referred to, various tracings, indicating a knowledge of
the existence of this continent which would appear to have been
derived from other than legendary sources. De Gonneville, a French
navigator, who sailed from Honfleur in 1503 on a voyage to the East
Indies, is credited with the honour of being the first discoverer of
Terra Australis. “He is said to have doubled the Cape of Good Hope,
and, being driven by stress of weather into an unknown sea, there
found a land inhabited by friendly people, with whom he stayed some


time, being accompanied back to France by one of the king’s sons,
named Paulmier.”
Two centuries and a-half after the event, the Comte de Maurepas
searched the records of the Admiralty in Normandy for the original
declaration of De Gonneville, but could not find it; but he found a
tradition of such a document having been well known amongst the
records; and the French writer of this account asserts that he had
seen a copy of the memorial presented to Pope Alexander VII., with a
note by the proprietor of the copy stating that he received it as a gift
from Paulmier himself.
The declaration of De Gonneville is to the effect (as recorded by the
Priest Paulmier) “ that the ship of De Gonneville on its way to the
East Indies was driven out of its course by a tempest, and was thrown
upon a great ‘Southern Land.’” No latitude or longitude is given,
and the position assigned to this land by French geographers near the
time unhappily fix it where no land whatever is now known to exist —
namely, longitude 20 deg. east, latitude 48 deg. south. De Gonneville
is made to say “ that wanting water they cast anchor in a river as
large as the Orne near Caen; that they remained six months, and were
kindly entertained by the inhabitants.” Unfortunately, again, the
description of the country, the people, their habits, costumes, and
mode of life, by no means accord with those of Australia and its
natives. The whole story, however, may be passed over, for it does
not identify itself in any manner with Australia. The general belief,
however, is that it was Madagascar whereon De Gonneville landed.
Another claim has been put forward for the noted Portuguese navi-
gator, Ferdinandez Maglianes (commonly called Magellan), when in
the service of Charles Y. of Spain, based upon the authority of
an ancient map; but his right to the honour of being the first dis-
coverer is but shadowy.
In Wytfliets “Descriptions Ptolemaic Argument urn,” published in
1598, the following passage occurs: —“ The Australis Terra is the most
southern of all lands; it is separated from New Guinea by a narrow
strait; its shores are hitherto but little known, since after one voyage
and another, that route has been deserted, and seldom is the country
visited, unless when sailors are driven there by storms. The
Australis Terra begins at two or three degrees from the Equator,* and is
maintained by some to have so great an extent that if it were
thoroughly explored it would be regarded as a fifth part of the world.”
But for the singular mention in the passage I have quoted, of the
“ narrow strait separating Australis Terra from New Guinea,” the
statement is so vague and supposititious as to be scarcely worth notice,
for although New Guinea was probably well known to mariners in the
first century, during the maritime inactivity which prevailed in the
middle ages it relapsed into oblivion, and it was not until the early
part of the sixteenth century (1511) that it again emerged into
notice.
The first to penetrate the veil of obscurity which enveloped it for so
many generations were Francisco Senarro and Antonio de Breu. Don
Jorges de Meneses, a Portuguese sailor, again visited the country in
1526, on his way from Malacca to the Moluccas He remained in one
of the northern bays of the island for a month to refit his vessel, and
named the island Papua, on account of the frizzled hair of the
natives, and that name first appears on a chart published at Venice in
1554.
* The extreme northern point of Australia is situated 10 deg. 40 min. south of
the Equator,, or a difference of about 7 deg.


It was not until the year 1606-7 that Torres sailed through this
strait, nor was the fact of his having done so known to the world until
the end of the eighteenth century, when Dalrymple discovered his
report amongst the archives of Manilla, and did justice to his memory.
By close study of geography and navigation, and a knowledge of the
figure of the earth superior to the current notions of his time,
Christopher Columbus a native of Genoa, a man of humble descent,
born 1437, arrived at the conclusion that there were unknown lands
separated from Europe by the Atlantic Ocean. After vainly seeking
aid from Genoa, Portugal, and England, he went to Spain, where his
elder brother, Bartholomew Don, was settled. Fired with scientific
zeal and the adventurous spirit of the real navigator, we see him as
he was, across the centuries, waiting with his charts for an audience
with Philip—repelled, put aside, laughed at—penniless, but patient,
rich in the hero-stuff, pushing on, and certain, under his uncer-
tainty, that some day the sun would shine for him and his plans.
Columbus would not be the great man—imperishably great—that he
is to-day had it not been for the large-brained comprehension, the
sympathy, the intuition, and the faith in him of a woman. It took a
woman to discover the man who was to discover a new world.
There are some who may say that what a woman does not, or cannot
discover, is not worth knowing; and, woman-like, that noble-hearted,
enterprising, brave-natured Isabella of Spain, who was behind the
door of the great fame of Columbus, proves this true in so noble a
sense that, at the mention of her name, every man and woman here
will honour and revere her memory.
Great men have almost always been backed up in their most
notable and adventurous enterprises by some great woman—every
Columbus has had his Isabella. Men might jeer and deride, might
suspect and ridicule, but she was rock-like in her belief; her
intuition marked out unerringly the path his genius would take;
her heart and her hope shot ahead of him like a brilliant meteor
lighting the night of his sky.
In 1492, a squadron of three small vessels was fitted out by the
Spanish Government, and Columbus was placed in command. He
discovered the Bahama Isles, Cuba, and Hispaniola.o In a second
voyage he discovered many more of the West Indian Islands; and in
his third voyage, in 1498, he discovered the eastern coast of South
America, and sailed for 4000 miles along the coast, from the Orinoco
River to Cape Horn; and although both Amerigo Vespucci and
Sebastian Cabot, who had been sent out on a voyage of discovery by
Ferdinand, King of Castile,* had reached America a short time before
him, Columbus was undoubtedly entitled to the honour of being the
discoverer of that great continent.
These discoveries fired the enthusiasm and created a thirst for new
territory, stimulated national ambition, and called into action brave
and able seamen. The Indian Ocean was invaded by the vessels of
the British, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and French. Meanwhile,
Australia lay a blank to the then civilised world.
In 1595, Fernandez de Quiros (the Columbus of Australia) sailed
westward from Chili, and discovered the Solomon Islands. About
the year 1603, after years of persistent entreaty, De Quiros succeeded
in inducing Philip HI. of Spain to grant him men and ships to search
for the still newer world than that discovered by Columbus. He sailed
from Peru in 1604, in command of three small armed vessels—the
“Capitana,” “Almiranta,” and a small tender, the “ Zabra” —the

largest of which did not exceed fifty or sixty tons; and although he
was not permitted to set foot on Australian soil, it was his dream for
nearly thirty years that a “ Great South Land” existed. For months
no great southern land was sighted. At length De Quiros saw before
him, and for two or three days sailed along, the shores of what he
believed to be the object of his long cherished hopes—the “Great
Southern Continent.” He anchored, at length, in a wide inlet on the
eastern coast of what we now know as the largest island of the New
Hebrides Group. A landing was effected; several days were spent
ashore. Unfortunately, the crew came into conflict with the natives.
The chief of the tribe and many of the natives were shot down. The
sailors mutinied, overpowered some of their officers, and, under cover
of darkness, weighed anchor, and sailed away, compelling De Quiros
to pilot his own vessel back to Mexico. On his arrival in Spain, he
reported the discovery of a “ Great Southern Continent,” to which he
gave the name “ Terra Australis del Espiritu Santo.'’
Torres, his second in command, who had been left behind at Santo
with some of his crew, proved that the island was not a continent.
Having sailed round it, he made a course north-westerly, not with the
intention of making further discoveries, but in the hope of reaching
Manilla, to refit his vessel and obtain supplies for the homeward
voyage. In the month of August, 1606, he passed through the strait
separating New Guinea from Australia (which strait now bears his
name). He sighted land on the south (probably Cape York), which he
took to be a small island, and thus missed the honour of immortal-
ising his name as the first discoverer of the Australian Continent.
The report of this eventful voyage, written at Manilla in 1606-7, was
not, as I have said before, known to the world until 186 years
afterwards.
In the year following (1607), within a few months after Torres had
passed through this intricate passage, a party of Dutch sailors, who had
been sent out from Batavia, in a small vessel named the “ Duyphen,”
(Dutch for dove), to explore the southern coast of New Guinea,
actually landed on the coast of Australia somewhere about latitude
13 deg. south (on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria),
unconscious of the fact that they stood upon the hitherto unknown
continent, having unaccountably missed seeing the strait that
separates New Guinea from Australia. Several of the crew were
killed by the natives, and this put an end, for many years, to further
discoveries.
Ten years later, Captain Dirk Hartog, in the “Endracht,” from
Amsterdam, discovered the west coast of Australia, and left a tin plate
on a post at Shark’s Bay to record his discovery. Eighty-one years
afterwards (1697), Vlaming, in the “ Geelvink,” found this plate and
replaced it by another. In 1801 this record was again discovered by
one of the crew of the French ship “ Naturaliste,” half-buried in the
sand, and Captain Hamelin, with rare good taste, erected a new post
on the spot, and fixed the plate thereon.
In 1622 Cape Leuwin was discovered by the captain of the Dutch
ship “Lioness” —(that part of the coast bears the name of the “Land
of Lions” on the old charts).
Peter Nuyts, in 1627, discovered that part of the south coast lying
between Albany (King George’s Sound) and Eucla (the Great Australian
Bight, as it is called). The following year (1628) Edel discovered the
coast north of Swan Eiver, on the banks of which the city of Perth has
since been built; and then followed further discoveries along the
western coast, as far north as Nickol Bay (lat. 20 deg. 40 min.
south).


Tasman, in the year 1644, after his discovery of New Zealand and
Van Diemen’s Land, sailed along and charted the western and
northern coasts of New Holland, from about 22 deg. south latitude
to a point on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria, about
12 deg. south of the Equator. His chart, a copy of which I have
here, shows New Guinea connected with the Australian Continent, he,
too, having missed seeing the strait that separates the former from the
latter. From the point last mentioned, Tasman sailed northerly to
about 4 deg. south, off the western coast of New Guinea, about
longtitude 132 deg. 45 min. east. His chart also shows Tasmania as
a part of the Australian Continent.
The first Englishman to land on Australian soil was William
Dampier, in 1688, when he struck the western coast at King’s Sound,
(lat. 17 deg. south), on the eastern shore of which the town of Derby
has recently been laid out.
Eleven years later Dampier revisited the west coast in the ship
“Roebuck,” sent out by the British Government on a voyage of discovery
(Roebuck Bay was discovered and named by Dampier on this voyage)-
In 1705 the last voyage of exploration was undertaken by the Dutch,
and closes the history of the early discovery of “ Terra Australis.”
_ The existence of the “ Southern Continent” was definitely estab-
lished, and it remained for the English and French nations to deter-
mine its size and formation with accuracy, and to fill up the gaps on
the coast line.*
Such was the state of affairs when Captain James Cook appeared
on the scene in 1770. In that year, after completing his observations
of the Transit of Venus£Tanuary 3rd, Tahiti (or Otaheite), he
sailed southward and westward, discovered and named “ Cook’s Strait,”
which separates the North from the Middle Island of New Zealand—
which Tasman had discovered 127 years previously. Thence Cook
shaped a course westward-by-south, and discovered the eastern coast of
New Holland, a short distance west of Cape Howe, on April 15th, 1770.
He then sailed along the eastern coast, entered and named “Botany
Bay,” where he landed, hoisted the Union Jack, and took possession
of the country in the name of King George ; continuing his course
northward for nearly 3000 miles, passing through Torres’ Strait,
which he named after his ship, the “ Endeavour”—ignorant of the fact
of its previous discovery by Torres —and thence home to report the
existence of a fine and fertile country. Seventeen years later (1787)
the colony of New South Wales was founded.
Such is a brief, but very imperfect, sketch of the “ History of Early
Discovery of Australia.”
Professor Seeley (Cambridge Professor of Modern History), in his
recently published book, “ Expansion of England,” has shown that
the great event of the 18th century—indeed, the greatest fact of
modern English history—has been the expansion of England into lands
beyond the seas, the foundation and growth of a Greater Britain.
The great hundred years’ struggle between England and France,
lasting from the time of Louis XIV. to the days of Napoleon, was in,
the main a duel between the two nations for the possession of the
New World. By the close of the last century the history of the strife
was no longer doubtful. In India, Wellesley had annihilated French
influence, and was rapidly consolidating the English dominion, France
had lost for ever her finest possessions in America, though she, on
her side, had dealt us a return blow in assisting to tear from England
her North American colonies. But the struggle was not over, and it
» See VaUgondy’s map.


was destined to yield yet wider triumphs for the British race. The-
very humiliation which France had helped to inflict on her rival was
to prove a potent factor in the further expansion of Greater Britain.
It is probably no exaggeration to say that it is to the hostility of
France, and her action in America, that we owe in no small measure
the British colonisation of Australasia —a work that must ever stand
as the most momentous event of our century.
The secession of her North American provinces had well-nigh left
England without a colonial empire. The British nation straightway
set about searching for a compensation for their lost possessions, and
to find a new outlet for their energies and for their surplus population;
and a new world lay ready to their hand. As Livingstone and Stanley
in our own days have called into existence a new realm in the Dark
Continent of Africa, so in the days of our grandfathers the genius of
Captain Cook had opened up a new realm in the unknown and
mysterious seas of the South.
But in these “ Southern Seas,” as formerly in America and India,
Great Britain and France were, and, indeed, still are rivals. In
exploration each nation can boast of distinguished names. Anson,
Vancouver, Cook, Furneaux, and Flinders had active competitors in
the Frenchmen, Bougainville, Marion, Dumont D’Urville, La Perouse,
D’Entrecasteaux, and Baudin. Nor were the English the first to
entertain the design of colonising this new land. In 1756, an eminent
and learned Frenchman, Charles de Brosses, President of the Parlia-
ment of Dijon (to whom we owe the invention of the name Australasia),
in his Histoire des Navigations aux Terres Australis, “ had strongly
urged upon the Government of France the wisdom of establishing a
French colony in the South Seas.” In the work cited, the author
passes in review the relative advantages of various portions of the
Southern world, and concludes “ that some part of Australasia offers
the best prospect for settlement, the country being favourable and
easy of access.” With a sagacious foresight, since amply justified by
events, he declares “ that any colony planted in those regions would
hold Ariadne’s clue for the whole Southern world. From such a
centre, every part of this new realm could in turn be explored and
conquered, from the Equator to the Antarctic circle.” He elaborately
discusses the best means of forming such a settlement, and warns
his countrymen against “the danger of waiting until some other
nation had proved the practicability of a colony by trying the experi-
ment,” for, he adds, “whenever any nation had gained a foothold, it
will not suffer another to share the territory to which it has acquired
a right by conquest.”
The President’s warning, luckily for the British nation, remained
unheeded. France missed her opportunity; and it was left to England
to take the first steps and found a new empire in these southern seas,
from which, justifying the Frenchman’s forecast, she did not scruple
to warn off all intruders.
It was probably due to the fact of the coincidence of Captain
Cook’s discoveries with the loss of the American colonies, quite as
much as to her naval supremacy, that Great Britain claimed to be
beforehand with her rival. It takes an effort of imagination to realise
the new world which Cook revealed, and how his discoveries opened
up to men’s minds the possibilities and promise of the new field for
enterprise. Until his time, “ New Holland”—for as yet “Australia”
was not*—had been little more than a geographical expression; parts
♦ The name “Australia” was first suggested by Captain Flinders—the choice of a
name lay between “ Australia,” “ Terra Australis,” and “ New South Wales.”


of the northern and western coasts, as we have seen, and the Bay
of Storms, at the southern extremity of Van Diemen’s Land, were
laid down, more or less vaguely, on the maps from the reports of
Dutch navigators of the preceding century, and these old and infre-
quent voyagers had brought back only reports of forbidding shores
and desolate, barren territory, inhabited by wretched, hostile savages,
with no redeeming The right to these dreary coasts was
conceded without dispute to the Dutch navigators of the preceding
century. The English had no part in its discovery, if we except
William Dampier, who in 1688 discovered King’s Sound, on the
north-western coast.
In 1783, a bill passed the Imperial Parliament for the transporta-
tion of criminals. In 1787, Botany Bay, which had been discovered by
Captain Cook in 1770, was selected as the site for the first settlement
in New Holland. Captain Henry Phillip, of long experience and
training as a naval officer—a man generous of heart and a strict
disciplinarian—was chosen as commander of the first fleet, consisting
of eleven vessels, the largest of which was not more than 450 tons
burthen. On May 13th, 1787, Captain Phillip sailed from the Isle of
Wight, and on January 18th, 1788 (eight months afterwards), entered
Botany Heads.
In taking possession of New South Wales, which at that period
and for many years afterwards comprised all the eastern part of Aus-
tralia, as far west as about 135 deg. east longitude, Captain Phillip
assembled his men, hoisted the Union Jack, and on the 7th February,
1788, on the south shore of Darling Harbour, addressed the prisoners
in eloquent and feeling terms, pointing out “ that their future happi-
ness and welfare in their new home depended in great measure upon
themselves.”
His utterances on that memorable occasion, viewed in the light of
subsequent events, are prophetic. Captain Phillip said:—“What
Frobisher, Ealeigh, Delaware, and Gates did for America, that we are
to-day met to do for New Holland, but under happier auspices. Our
enterprise was wisely conceived, deliberately devised, and effectually
organised. The Sovereign, the Parliament, and the people united to
give their authority, sanction, and encouragement. We are here to
take possession of the fifth division of the globe on behalf of the
British people, and to found a state which, we hope, will not only
occupy and rule this great country, but will also be the beneficent
patroness of the entire Southern Hemisphere. How grand is the
prospect which lies before this youthful nation!”
These prophetic words, uttered over 112 years ago, in presence, for
the most part, of 750 convicts, in a land of savage tribes, are a fitting
monument to the memory of the first Governor of Australia, to whose
calm and even mind much of the ultimate success of the early
settlement of Australia is due. This first settlement was planted sub-
stantially upon the lines indicated in detail by the French President
more than a quarter of a century previously.
In 1785, nearly three years before the arrival of Governor Phillip,
the French Government despatched Admiral La Perouse with an
expedition to circumnavigate the world, and to explore the coasts of
New Holland, doubtless with some more or less definite design of settle-
ment. When, on January 26th, 1788, the French ships “ Boussole”
and “ Astrolabe” sailed into Botany Bay, La Perouse had the mortifica-
tion to find that Governor Phillip’s fleet had cast anchor there just
five days before him, and on the very same day that Sydney was
founded.


Great Britain, having thus firmly established possession of this
■continent, formally laid claim to the whole territory lying to the east
of 135 deg. east longitude, including, of course, Van Diemen’s Land,
which was then supposed to form part of the mainland of New Holland
(for as yet Bass’ Strait had not been discovered).
George Bass, a young surgeon, who, with Mathew Flinders (mid-
shipman), accompanied Governor Hunter (Governor Phillip’s
successor)in the “Reliance” to New South Wales, in 1795, left Sydney
on December 3rd, 1797, in an open whaleboat, with a crew of six
men. The main object of his expedition was to settle the question
of the suspected insularity of Van Diemen’s Land, and this he did
without knowing it. During his absence from Sydney of eleven
weeks, with only six weeks’ provisions, he had the good fortune to
discover Twofold Bay, a scene of never-failing beauty, and a place of
importance in our early history. The most valuable portion of his
labours was the discovery of Western Port Bay, where he remained
thirteen days, which commodious harbour he carefully examined and
fully described. He had examined 600 miles of the coast south of
Port Jackson, the latter half of which had been utterly unknown up
to the time of this expedition.*
Four years later (1801), Lieutenant Grant, in company with
Barellier, was despatched in the Government brig, “Lady Nelson,”
from Sydney to make a survey of Western Port. The discovery of /• , ~/)
Port Phillip was reserved for Grant’s successor, in the '-‘Lady Nelson,” //
who discovered the Heads on January sth, 1802, but was prevented
from entering by contrary winds. About the middle of the following
month, however, he succeeded in passing through the Heads, but
his examination was confined to the southern and western parts of
the bay, and beyond the fact that he named Arthur’s Seat, Swan
Bay, and Point Nepean, little or nothing was known until the publi-
cation of Labilliere’s Early History of the Colony of Victoria, in 1878.
On April 26th, 1802, Mathew Flinders (on the eve of completing
the circumnavigation of Australia, during which he discovered
that part of the coast line between the Great Australian Bight
and Cape Otway) entered Port Phillip Heads, a few weeks after its
discovery by Lieutenant Murray, and remained there seven days.
During that period he closely examined and charted that part of
the bay west of a line drawn between Mount Martha and Station
Peak, andhis report to Governor Philip Gidley King(whohad succeeded
Governor Hunter after Governor Phillip), on his arrival in Sydney,
led to Mr. Charles Grimes, the then acting Surveyor-General of New
South Wales, being sent in the colonial schooner “ Cumberland”
(Lieut. Charles Robbins, H.M.S. “ Buffalo,” in command) to make a
more careful survey and examination of the country bordering its
shores. In the short space of about one month, Mr. Grimes, with a
limited staff, surveyed the shore line and took soundings in the bay.
I have here a copy of his original chart, which I venture to say is
a lasting monument of his industry and ability.
Mr. J. J. Shillinglaw, F.R.G.S., has done good service in rescuing
from oblivion Grimes’ journal of his exploration of Port Phillip in
1803. Mr. Grimes was accompanied by a Mr. Flemming, who had
been specially chosen by Governor King to report upon the character
* On the 9th December, 1798, Bass and Flinders, in the Norfolk, from Port
Jackson, rounded the north-western extremity of Van Diemen’s Land, and hailed
with joy and mutual congratulations the completion of their long-wished-for dis-
covery of a passage into the Southern Indian Ocean. On the 22nd they reached the
Derwent; and on their return to Sydney, on the 11th January, 1799, Governor
Hunter, upon the recommendation of Flinders, gave the name Bass’ Strait.


of the country. The season appears to have been an exceptionally
dry one. The scarcity of fresh water, and the numerous native tribes
met with, especially near the present sites of Melbourne and Geelong,
probably prevented examination of the country inland. Be that as
it may, Flemming’s report was not of a very favourable character.
Grimes’ map shows that the Saltwater Eiver was explored as far as
Maribyrnong, and that the Yarra was ascended as far as about Bight’s
Falls. Batman’s Hill, which in the early days of Melbourne was a
prominent feature at the western end of Collins-street, is also
described.
The journal and chart show how faithfully Grimes and Lieut.
Robbins (the captain of the “Cumberland”) carried out Governor King’s
instructions; for, in addition to the work of surveying Port Phillip
Bay, he carried an important despatch from the Governor to the
leader of the French Exploring Expedition, Captain Baudin, who
it was known was cruising about somewhere in Bass’ Strait. The
substance of the despatch ran as follows :
“It being reported that you propose to leave some of your men
either in Van Diemen’s Land or on the western coast of New South
Wales, in order to form there a French colony, I deem it my duty to
declare to you, Monsieur le Commandant, that, in virtue of the Act of
1788 for taking possession, solemnly proclaimed by England, all these
countries form an integral part of the British Empire, and that you
cannot occupy any part of them without breaking the bonds of
friendship which have so recently been established between the two
nations. I will not even attempt to conceal from you that such is the
nature of my instructions on this point, that it will be my duty to
oppose, by all means in my power, the execution of the project you
are suspected of being about to execute; in consequence of which, His
Majesty’s ship “ Cumberland” has received orders not to leave you until
the officer who commands her is satisfied that your operations are
foreign to any kind of invasion of British territory in these parts.”
The “Cumberland” came up with Baudin’s ships, the “Naturaliste”
and “Geographe,” lying at Sea Elephant Bay, east coast of King’s
Island. Mr. Grimes and the captain (Lieut. Robbins) boarded the
“Naturaliste,” and delivered Governor King's despatch. During the
week after the arrival of the “ Cumberland” and the delivery of the des-
patch to Captain Baudin, the representatives of the two nations frater-
nised and exchanged hospitalities on the disputed shores of King’a
Island. The French had already set up an observatory and pitched
their tents near the beach, and the French flag floated above their
camp. Perhaps it was this proceeding that confirmed Lieut. Robbins’
suspicions, or perhaps the French commander would not give him
the assurance he wanted; at all events, before the week had expired,
the Englishman made up his mind that the time for decisive action
had come, and on December 14th, 1802, he made a formal landing,
in full view of the Frenchmen, marched his little party to the rear of
the Frenchmen’s tents, hoisted His Majesty’s colours on a large tree,
posted at the foot of the tree a guard of three marines with loaded
muskets, fired three volleys, gave three cheers, and took formal pos-
session of the island in the name of King George, and remained on
the island until January 17th, 1808, the Frenchmen having sailed
away some days previously. The “ Cumberland” then made for Port
Phillip Heads, to commence the survey of Port Phillip Bay.
This defiant assertion of British claims by a mere handful of
English sailors, in the teeth of ten times their number of traditional
enemies, might well have wounded the vanity of people less suscep-
tible than Frenchmen, and is in striking contrast with the vacillating


policy and indecision of the late English Premier (Lord Derby), to
whom we owe the loss of the northern half of New Guinea and the
adjacent islands. A less peremptory message from Governor King to
the French commander would no doubt have resulted in the loss of
nearly two-thirds of the Australian Continent. There can be no
shadow of a doubt as to what Baudin’s intentions were.
I come now to the project of the English Government to found a
second colony on the shores of Bass’ Strait, and to the unsuccessful
attempt of Lieut. -Governor Collins to establish that settlement on the
shores of Port Phillip Bay in 1803.
The idea of forming the new settlement, as we have already seen,
originated with Captain Philip Gidley King, the then Governor of
New South Wales, and was doubtless suggested to him by the arrival
at Port Jackson of the French ships, “ Naturaliste” and “ Geographe,”
and the suspicion this excited in his mind with respect to French
designs on His Majesty’s territories in New Holland.
On May 21st, 1802, Governor King, in a despatch to the Duke of
Portland, pressed upon him the importance of forestalling the French
by forming a colony at the newly-discovered harbour of Port Phillip,
of the soil, character, and advantageous position, of which he had just
received a favourable report from Captain Flinders, who had explored
it a month previously.
When the Governor’s despatch reached England there was for the
moment peace with France; but French movements were viewed with
the utmost suspicion, and a speedy revival of the war was regarded
as inevitable. His Majesty’s ship “Calcutta” was under orders to
take to New South Wales a further detachment of 400 prisoners
and some 50 free settlers. Preparations were made to send her off
immediately; King’s recommendation therefore came at an opportune
juncture, and was at once taken into favourable consideration.
Mr. James Bonwick, an old Victorian and Tasmanian colonist, has
recently found, amongst the miscellaneous documents in the Record
Office, one which records the results of the deliberations of the
English Cabinet. The document is unsigned, though, from other
evidence, its date can be fixed at or near the middle of December,
1802.
This memorandum sets forth the views of the Imperial Government
on Australian colonisation at this important period, and may be
briefly summarised thus.
The attention of the Government had been directed to the move-
ments of the French ships, commanded by Captain Baudin, which,
as we have seen, were cruising about in Bass’ Strait, and to Governor
King’s suspicion that the French commander intended to found a
colony somewhere in Van Diemen’s Land, King’s Island, or on the
mainland of New South Wales.
Governor King, in his despatch to the Duke of Portland, stated
that if the resources of his Government could have furnished the
means for founding a new settlement at IPort Phillip, he would have
done so without waiting for orders, so urgent did he consider the
matter. King also pointed out the advantages of Port Phillip for
fishery purposes —seals, sea-elephants, and whales being abundant in
the Strait —and that such a position, if taken up by the French,,
would, in any future war, be favourable for interrupting communica-
tion between the United Kingdom and New South Wales.
It was also argued that such a settlement would be useful as a
moral sanatorium, where the best-behaved prisoners could be sent,
and so kept apart from the criminal importations from the old
country.


The memorandum then goes on to say that the Lieutenant-Governor
of the new settlement was to be under the control of the Governor at
Port Jackson.
This document is of so much interest, as setting forth the views
of the Government on Australian colonisation at this important
period, that I quote it in full: —
“ Memorandum of a Proposed Settlement in Bass’ Straits.
“1. The attention of the French Government has recently been
directed to New Holland, and two French ships have during the
present year been employed in surveying the western and southern
coasts and in exploring the passage through Bass’ Straits to New
South Wales. By the accounts which have been recently received
from Governor King, at Port Jackson, there is reason to believe that
the French navigators had not discovered either of the two most
important objects within those straits —namely, the capacious and
secure harbour to the north, to which Governor King has given the
name of Port Phillip, nor a large island called King’s Island, situated
nearly midway on the western side of the straits, and which extends
about fifty miles in every direction.
“ 2. Governor King represents each of these two objects as deserving
the attention of the Government, but especially Port Phillip, where he
urgently recommends that an establishment should be immediately
formed; at the same time observing that, if the resources of his
Government could have furnished the means, he should have thought
it his duty, without waiting for instructions, to have formed a settle-
ment there.
“ 3. The reasons adduced by Governor King in support of this
opinion are principally drawn from the advantages which the posses-
sion of such a port naturally suggests for the valuable fishery that
may be carried on in the straits, where the seal and the sea-elephant
abound, and from the policy of anticipating the French, to whom our
discovery of this port and of King’s Island must soon be known, and
who may be stimulated to take early measures for establishing them-
selves in positions so favourable for interrupting, in any future war,
the communication between the United Kingdom and New South
Wales, through the channel of Bass’ Straits.
“ 4. In addition to these reasons, it may be stated that it would be
of material consequence to the settlement of Port Jackson, which has
now arrived to a population of 6000 persons, if an interval of some
years were to be given for moral improvements, which cannot be
expected to take place in any material degree while there is an annual
importation of convicts, who necessarily carry with them those vicious
habits which were the cause of their having fallen under the sentence
of the law.
“5. From a due consideration of all these circumstances, it is
proposed to adopt the recommendation of Governor King, and to
appoint a competent person to proceed in the “ Calcutta” direct to Port
Phillip, for the purpose of commencing the establishment there, by
means of a certain number of free settlers and male convicts, now
ready to be embarked in that ship; and further, that the establish-
ment shall be placed under the control of the principal Government
at Port Jackson, upon a similar footing to that in Norfolk Island.
“6. The expense of this new settlement, beyond what would
necessarily attend the conveyance and supplies for the prisoners if
sent to Port Jackson, may be calculated at a sum not exceeding
£15,000 a year, subject to a small additional charge if circumstances


should render it advisable to send some of the convicts under a
sufficient guard to secure the possession of King’s Island.
“ 7. With a view to this service, and for the purposes of keeping
open the communication between the two settlements and with Port
Jackson, it is thought necessary that a small vessel shall be stationed
in the straits, to be employed in such manner as the Lieutenant-
Governor, acting under the orders of Governor King, may point out.
“8. Experience having proved the great inconvenience arising
from the establishment of the New South Wales regiment at Port
Jackson, it is conceived that considerable benefit would result from
selecting a detachment of the Eoyal Marines for this service.
“9. With a view of exciting the convicts to good behaviour, it is
proposed that such of them as shall merit the recommendation of the
Governors abroad shall be informed that their wives and families
will be permitted to go to them, at the public expense, and to engage
or hire them as indentured servants; and to render this act of humane
policy as conducive to the benefit of the colony as the circumstances
of the case will permit, it will be necessary that these families shall
on no account be sent upon ships on which convicts shall be embarked,
and that they shall be informed their reunion with the objects of
their regard would depend upon their own good behaviour as well as
upon that of their husbands.”
The recommendations of the memorandum were adopted by the
Cabinet, and in January, 1803, the “ Calcutta,” under the command of
Captain Woodriff, with a detachment of 51 officers, sergeants, cor-
porals, privates, &c., 307 prisoners (17 of whom were accompanied
by their wives), 13 free settlers (three or four of whom were married
men, who had obtained permission from Lord Hobart to throw in
their lot with the new colony), was ordered to proceed to Port Phillip
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel David Collins. A portrait of
one of those free settlers, Mr. James Hobbs, was published in 1878 in
Mr. Shillinglaw’s Historical Becords of Port Phillip. Mr. Hobbs, with
whom I became personally acquainted early in 1853, lived to see the
country pronounced by Lieut.-Governor Collins as uninhabitable
become the most remarkable of England’s colonies, and a handful of
his countrymen on the seaboard of a continent spread and grow into
seven great centres of civilisation. “In the space of the life of a
man who only died a few years ago, the predictions of poets, philo-
sophers, and statesmen, the thing has been done and verified in the
Australia of to-day.”
Lieut.-Colonel David Collins was appointed Lieutenant-Governor
of the new settlement; the Rev. Robert Knopwood, chaplain; sur-
geons, Messrs. William J. Anson, Matthew Bowden, and William
Hopley; Mr. Leonard Fosbrook, as commissary; Mr. George
Prideaux Harris, as surveyor; Mr. Adolarius William Henry
Humphreys, as mineralogist; and two superintendents of convicts.
Lieutenant Collins, who had had eight years’ previous colonial
experience, having accompanied Governor Phillip in the first fleet to
Botany Bay, in 1788, in the capacity of Judge-advocate, and also as
secretary to the Governor, after returning to England in 1796, wrote
and published his well-known and valuable Account of the English
Colony of New South Wales, the first volume of which appeared in
1798, and the second, which carried on the history to August, 1801,
being published in 1802.
Collins is said to have been a remarkably handsome man, with
delightful manners. He seems to have had not a little tact in
managing men, and to have possessed many of the qualities requisite


in the founder of a colony. If he erred in his judgment of the
capabilities of the new colony as a place for settlement, he certainly
showed sagacity in his subsequent choice of a site for Hobart.
Captain Daniel Woodriff had also been in New South Wales in
1792 and 1793, and was so favourably impressed with the capabilities
of the settlement there that, when he received orders to take out a
transport, he petitioned Lord Hobart for a grant of land for his sons,
with the view of settling his whole family in the colony. Captain
Woodriff had as his first lieutenant James Kingston Tuckey, a young
Irishman of great energy and ability, who afterwards wrote an
account of the expedition, which was published in 1805. His subse-
quent career was an eventful one. In 1805, the “ Calcutta,” in convoy-
ing ships from St. Helena, was captured by the French, after a gallant
defence, in which Tuckey particularly distinguished himself. He
remained in a French prison for nine years. During his incarceration
in France he married a lady who was his fellow-prisoner—Miss
Margaret Stuart, daughter of the commander of a ship in the East
India Company’s service at Bengal; she had also been taken by the
Eochfort squadron in her passage in a packet to join her father in
India. On his release, in 1814, he was made a commander, and in
1816 he obtained the command of an expedition to explore the Eiver
Congo (or as it was then called, the Eiver Zaire). The members of
the expedition suffered terribly from fever, 21 dying out of a total of
56. Tuckey was one of the victims, dying on October 4th, 1816.
On Sunday, April 24th, 1803, the “Calcutta,” with the tender,
“ Ocean,” left Spithead, and three days later took their final departure
from the Isle of Wight, and on October 9th (168 days afterwards)
entered Port Phillip Heads.
The events of the voyage are recorded in the chaplain’s diary.
He particularises when, where, and with whom he dined, supped,
played cards, or smoked ; he lingers over the delights at Eio and the
Cape, at both of which places he, to quote his own words, appears
“ to have had a good time of it,” and though well on in middle age,
was still susceptible, for at Eio, he tells us, at the Convent of
Adjuda, he frequently met and conversed with a very beautiful
young lady, named Antonia Januaria. On the day of his departure
from Eio, the following entry appears in his diary:—“l saw Antonia
this evening at five, and we took leave of each othe.r for the last time,
with regret.” There are present with us this evening three, if not
more, ladies who were personally acquainted with this benevolent,
kind-hearted old parson. Many years ago, an esteemed friend of mine
sent me a picture of the old chaplain, on his white pony, attended, as
he invariably was on his errands of mercy, by his dog “ Pincher.”
The picture was accompanied by some doggerel lines, the authorship
of which my friend attributed to “ Pincher,” an extract from which I
will, with your permission, read :
* * *
Where sickness was you found him there, to sympathise and pray.
No whining doubtful dogmas, no brimstone fire and hell—
He preached God’s love and mercy, and kindly wished them well;
This fine old English clergyman, one of the good old time.
Who, when he visited the sick, always took them wine.
He wore no cross upon his back, but acted on the square—
A thing that’s often talked about, but practised very rare ;
He dressed not like a mountebank, nor yet like columbine,
Nor ritualistic vestments wore, this worthy old divine.
If gaudy dresses were to be true signs of what was meek,
Priests soon would make the surplice the church’s winding-sheet;
So thought this good old clergyman, one of the olden time,
Who, when he visited the sick, always took them wine.


the day after the “ Calcutta’s” arrival (the “Ocean” having
anchored three days previously) a landing was effected near the present
j- borrento - Several days were spent in exploring the country in
the direction of Arthur’s Seat. An expedition was sent to the other side
of the bay, but no fresh water could be found there, and the party
returned, as we find recorded in the diary from which I have been
quoting—‘‘By no means satisfied with the country. Except a few acres
about the head of the port (Corio Bay), there was no land within five
nines of water fit for agriculture; water everywhere scarce, snakes
plentiful, insects innumerable and tormenting, game not plentiful, and
As/j scarce. Blacks numerous and hostile—a tribe of 200 attacked
Tuckey s party, and in self-defence had to be fired on, with fatal effect.”
(Had the party ventured but a few miles inland from Swan Bay, or
.Fort Arlington, they would have discovered a large tract of the finest
agricultural land in Australia, fairly supplied with water.)
Eventually the site for the new settlement was selected a little
to the eastward of the present site of Sorrento jetty ; the ground was
cleared of scrub, and the landing of stores and men, erection of
buildings, <fec., was commenced.
Lieut.-Governor Collins very shortly came to the conclusion that
any attempt to plant a colony in his present position—“ a waste of
waterless sand”—must end in disaster. So gloomy was the view he
took of the situation, that he even found the Bay itself “ unfit for com-
mercial purposes on account of its difficulty of access, And that, owing
to the dangerous entrance and strong tides, it required a combination
of favourable circumstances to enable a vessel to enter without dis-
aster.”* His sole idea was to remove as soon as possible “from
these forbidding shores.” His instructions from the Colonial
Office had contemplated such a possibility, and allowed him
considerable latitude of choice as to the final destination of
"£f. ne Y colon y- .They were as follows Although Port
Phillip has been pointed out as the place judged most convenient
arid proper for fixing the first settlement of your establishment in
Bass Straits, nevertheless you are not positively restricted from
preference to any other part of the islands in Bass’ Straits,
which, upon communication with the Governor of New South Wales
and with his concurrence, you may have well-grounded reasons to
consider as more advantageously situated for that purpose.”
With the fixed idea in his mind that at Port Phillip nothing but
failure was possible, it became his most anxious thought to obtain
Governor King’s permission to remove his settlement. But here a new
difficulty arose. How was he to communicate with Governor King ?
Ihe Ocean had to proceed on her voyage to China; to charter her to
nu? V f^< a i ' es P a „ Sydney would have entailed considerable expense.
T* Calcutta ’ could not be spared ; she was necessary for protection,
and to be at hand to assist in removal if affairs took a more serious turn.
In this dilemma, Mr. William Collins, one of the free settlers, and
formerly a captain in the Navy, volunteered to go to Port Jackson in
an open whaleboat, to carry despatches to Governor King, and to
bring back his reply, Six prisoners volunteered as a crew (and for
this service they very justly received conditional pardon). The boat,
after being nine days at sea, was picked up by the “ Ocean,” on her
voyage to China, within 60 miles of Sydney Heads. Captain Collins
and his crew were taken on board and landed at Sydney.
Governor King acted promptly. The “Lady Nelson,” then on the eve
of sailing to Norfolk Island, was immediately sent to Port Phillip.
* Despatch to Lord Hobart, 1803.


The “ Ocean” was chartered, and the schooner “Francis” was also sent
down to assist in removing the settlement. Within four days of the
delivery of the despatch to Governor King, all three vessels had
sailed for Port Phillip.
Meantime, affairs at the new settlement had not gone on smoothly.
Twelve prisoners had absconded, with the vague idea of getting to
Port Jackson, or, what was more likely, of falling in with a whaler off
the coast. Search parties were organised, and at a distance of 100
miles from the camp, five of the runaways were captured, brought back,
and severely punished. Yet, notwithstanding, desertions continued, in
spite of all the vigilance that could be exercised. Some of the unfortu-
nates, after a bitter experience of the miseries of the bush, voluntarily
returned, in a deplorable state of illness and exhaustion, having
travelled scores of miles, subsisting on shellfish, game, or whatever
else they could pick up on the way. One or two men were shot,
others were captured ; and on the day of Collins’ departure, at least
seven men were left behind. What became of them was never known,
except in one instance. Thirty-two years afterwards (in 1835), when
John Batman came over from Launceston, he found a white man
with the Indented Head tribe. This was William Buckley. He had
forgotten (in the 35 years of his exile) his own language, and was
scarcely distinguishable from an aborigine. His large, ungainly
figure (considerably over six feet in height) was familiar in the streets
of Hobart in the memory of many now living. He died there in 1856.
Governor Collins made no attempt at exploration. He paid no heed
to Governor King’s hint, “that better country might be found at the
head of the port.” This is the more inexplicable, as the “ Calcutta” had
shortly after her arrival proceeded up the bay and anchored off the
present site of Williamstown, actually taking in 55 tons of fresh water
from the River Yarra. She was absent nearly a fortnight from the
settlement, and yet no attempt had been made to examine the country
on the banks of the Yarra.
A short time (after the arrival of orders from Governor King)
sufficed to build a jetty, 500 feet long, and the work of loading the
vessels was completed, and the settlement was finally abandoned on
the 27th of January, 1804. As to his ultimate destination Collins
was still in much perplexity, and for some weeks was doubtful whether
the Tamar or the Derwent would be the best site for the principal
settlement in Van Diemen’s Land. Indeed, in those days little or
nothing was known of the different localities, being limited by the
flying visits of Flinders and Bass. Eventually Collins decided to go
to the Derwent; and, after examining Eisdon Cove, finally selected the
present site of the city of Hobart.
Lieutenant Tuckey, in his narrative of Collins’ expedition, says of
the country he had just left:—“ The kangaroo seems to reign undis-
turbed lord of the soil, a dominion which, by the evacuation of Port
Phillip, he is likely to retain for ages.” Surely, as unlucky a
prophecy as was ever made. Could some true prophet have lifted the
veil of the future for Collins, he would have shown the disappointed
Lieutenant-Governor a picture which would have more than surprised
him. He would have shown him, within little more than thirty years,
a small band of adventurous pioneers leaving Van Diemen’s Land to
seek a new land of wealth on the shores of Port Phillip. Amongst
them he would have noticed a man whom he himself had brought out
as a boy in the “ Calcutta,” in 1803, and taken to the Derwent (John
Pascoe Fawkner), and who was now returning to the unpromising,
unproductive country which the Lieutenant-Governor had abandoned
in despair, to find it a land of fair, well-grassed plains and springs of


water; a land of promise, a veritable “Australia Felix,” soon to be
rich in flocks and herds, and agricultural products, and famed the
wide world over for its wool and its goldfields.
. Since Batman and Fawkner first set foot on the present site of the
city of Melbourne, the population has, in the comparatively short
space of half a century, and within a radius of ten miles, increased
to nearly half a million. The value of agricultural products raised
m the province during the past year has exceeded £7,000,000 sterling;
of wool, over £4,000,000; our annual imports, £24,000,000; exports,
£14,000,000. From the first discovery of gold in Victoria, July, 1851,
to December 31st, 1889, the value of gold raised exceeds the enormous
total of £225,000,000 sterling. With all our experience of the past
fifty years, who among us will venture to predict the progress during
the next fifty years of this small corner of the future Dominion of
Australia ?
I commenced with a quotation “ that Australia had started with
less history than any other land upon this earth.” I will conclude by
expressing my firm conviction that she will not long remain without
a history, but will surely know in the near future—in a Carlyleian
sense of the word—the “blessedness” of having a history, and of
holding a very significant place among the nations of the world. Her
varied and progressive population, her contrasts of climate, her
vast, varied, and wonderfully rich resources, her social -and mercan-
tile progressiveness, and her important geographical position in the
Pacific, all unite to assure the fulfilment of such a prediction.
I could have wished, had time permitted, to have told you some-
thing more of the discoveries of Tasman, Furneaux, Du Fresne, Baudin,
Vancouver, Peron, and many others; something about the intrepid
French navigator, Admiral le Comte de la Perouse ; something more
concerning that brave, noble, and skilful prince of navigators, Captain
James Cook, and of his tragic death. I should like to have gone
more into detail in regard to the valuable labours of the indefatigable
Bass and Flinders, all of whom have won undying fame. I have been
compelled to eliminate the romance of discovery and exploration, and
to confine myself to the dry facts of history; and I trust that some,
at least, of my audience will not be disappointed with my humble
efforts.
In conclusion, to enumerate the various sources from which I have
compiled this paper would be to weary you at this late hour. I am
indebted chiefly to Dampier’s, Cook’s, and Flinders’ “ voyages ;” to
the writings of Collins, Tuckey, Major, Labilliere, Bonwick, Shilling-
law, J. B. Walker, W. Howitt, Professor Seeley, and many others. I
have also drawn largely from magazines, newspapers, and other
publications; and whenever or wherever I came across reliable
information on the subject, like Captain Cuttle I “made a note of it.”
- /These sources of information are not now easily obtainable, and are
becoming scarcer every year. A considerable number of journals of
early Australian discovery are kept for special reference, “in glass
cases, and under lock and key.” This information is indispensable
to every Australian who wishes to know the history of his country
and there are many reasons why we should not let die the remem-
brance of such heroic adventures and achievements.
Before sitting down, I cordially invite all my young friends, and old
ones, too, of both sexes, to become members of the Eoyal Geographical
Society of Australasia.
