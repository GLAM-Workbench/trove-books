FOREWORD.
Within the compass of the covers of this book is a faithful record of the work of one small
group of the■ millions of men who took part in the World War of 1914-1918.
It is designed primarily to act as a fitting souvenir for those men who served their country
in the Ninth Australian Field Ambulance, and their descendants.
The preparation .of the History—and more especially of the Calendar of Events and Muster
Roll—demanded a vast amount of labour in searching through, heaps of papers, War Diaries,
Reports of Operations, and Private Diaries. Base Records Office teas also drawn upon—unfor-
tunately with no great success. It is regretted that no estimate of the number of sick and
wounded who passed through the Ambulance during its career can be made. Unfortunately,
no figures are available.
For this labour, the men of the Unit are indebted to a Committee consisting of Capt. J. Webb,
Staff-Sergeant Mooney, L.-Cpl. Cunningham, and Privates Watson and Lawless —assisted at
times by others. Of these great and willing workers, the greatest and most willing was our
old friend, Staff-Sergeant Mooney. His was the lion’s share, for he ivas responsible for collat-
ing the information, and for the actual writing of the History.
It teas recognised that numerous histories would eventually appear—some couched in the bald
language of officialdom, others in the descriptive writing of tear correspondents—and it was felt
that this Record would appeal most to the Digger—for whom it is intended —if it was written
in the colloquial style to ivhich he had been more err less accustomed for a period of three years.
And I feel sure that no member of the Unit will cavil at the choice of style, when he recognises
the extent and veracity of the Record.
The various tables in the appendix were compiled on a Divisional scheme to co-ordinate all
Unit Histories for the compilation of the Divisional History.
It may be considered by some that the Crimes Lists could have been omitted without great
loss to the value of the Record. In my own humble opinion those tables are the ones we should
be proudest of. Few Australian Units in France can boast of the extremely low number of
offences committed. From November, 1918, to March, 1919, when the Unit was demobilised,
during ivhich time I had the honor of commanding—a most difficult time for all ranks, when
there was little to do, a winter to do it in, and a longing for home while we chafed and ivaited
for Repatriation —no* body of men could have acted in better spirit than the men of the Ninth.
My thanks to them!
Of the illustrations, three are Australian Official Photographs, while the remainder are re-
produced from prints obtained somehow or other by various members of the Unit.
The thanks of the members of the Unit are due to the Author — Staff-Sergeant Mooney, and
his body of helpers—and to the publishers, who are printing the book at less than cost price,
thanks to the generosity of the Managing Director, Mr. Robert Sands.
In conclusion, men of the Ninth —as the last and least of your Commanding Officers —I wish
you all the best of health and happiness—and may you prosper exceedingly.

History of the 9th Australian Field Ambulance.
GETTING THERE.
Chapter I.
IVERPOOL CAMP, New South
Wales, besides being many other
things, was the central depot
and collecting post for all Army
Medical Corps men enlisting
through the State.
There a Field Hospital Avas run, and it
serv r ed as an excellent training ground for
those soldiers in embryo, Avho, ere many
months had gone by, Avould be carrying out
their jobs in earnest, on the battlefields of
the Old World. Training days to the sol-
dier, like schooldays to the average youngster,
carry Avith them a certain touch of monotony,
and life in Liverpool Camp in those days
seemed to be just one blanky thing after an-
other. Leave to visit Sydney, official and other-
Avise, mostly otherwise, Avas fairly plentiful, and
served as a good set off to the daily dulness.
The drafting together of reinforcements and
the formation of neAv units for overseas ser-
vice, always caused a nine days’ stir, and the
general greyness of the usual every day exis-
tence Avas forgotten for the time.
These events were always heralded by the
receipt of numerous wireless communications
by the men, and “good oil” rumours were al-
ways on tap. Early in January, 1916, the air-
waves ran hot, and every man you met in camp
was a “furfey” king. Each one had a slightly
different yarn to that of his fellow, but all
agreed that in the near future a Field Ambu-
lance was to be formed. On this occasion the
source of their information proved to be a well
of truth, for a muster parade was called for the
afternoon of March 7th, 1916, and that was the
beginning of the 9th Field Ambulance.
Lieut.-Col. Maguire, with the shop gloss not
yet worn off his extra pips, that day laid bare
our very souls, and winnowed the chaff from
the wheat. He had something over six hundred
men to choose from, and he could afford to be
particular.
A few days sufficed for the selection, and the
chosen ones occupied their own lines of tents.
Within a fortnight they had built their own
camp and occupied it, and the last strands that
bound them to their Alma Mater, the Field Hos-
pital, were severed.
On the Seventh of March, Unit Routine Order
No. 1 was issued and the Ninth Australian Field
Ambulance commenced officially its being. It
was started well, and on you who read these
pages lies the onus of judgment, of how it carried
on through the troublous times, and finished
when its job was done.
The weeks of waiting for the hoisting of the
embarkation numbers were filled in by pre-
paratory Avorlc on parade ground and in lecture
tent for the sterner after-work. They were
hard days, but the boys fully realised their
necessity, and their ready will caused them to
appear to be less irksome.
And throughout all these days the bond be-
tween the C.O. and the men of his command
became gradually stronger and stronger, and in
response to justice and square dealing on his
part the men, without exception, played the
game. They were trusted, and they did not
belie that trust. They were given their job.
and they did their job, and Avhen it Avas finished
their time Avas their OAvn. In the first feAV
months of the unit’s existence, the necessities
arising in the task of moulding and fashioning


a fairly finished article, from the raw material
under his control, caused Lieut.-Col. Maguire
to be regarded with unfriendly eyes by many
of his men. As the months went on, however,
and the wider knowledge of experience came
to them, and they realised that there was neces-
sity where previously they had thought it did
not exist, their eyes took on a friendlier gaze.
The man had known his men, and the men had
learned to know their man, and towards the
finish, for anyone to say a single word against
Col. Maguire in the hearing of one of the Ninth
was the equivalent of looking for a fight.
With April came the news that the sailing
dates of the Third Division had been fixed, and
were not far distant. The final touches were
put on our preparations, and the Unit was
ready for what the Fates held in store.
Then came final leave, and we who were go-
ing across the seas to face the Great Unknown
had the opportunity of saying good-bye to those
who would have the harder part of watching
and waiting our return.
Once again in Camp it was only a matter of
a few days till April 30th came round, on
which day “B” Section, under the command
of Captain Vickers, proceeded by train to Syd-
ney, did a march past stunt in Moore Park,
camped that night on the Agricultural Show
Ground, and early next morning boarded the
“Benalla” at Woolloomooloo Bay. A wait of
a few hours, and as the big ship started to
move down harbour, the lads knew, that for
them at least, the great adventure had started.
They were the first to go, but their start was
only a short one. Their boat had scarcely
cleared the Heads before another party of
twenty men, under a N.C.0., had left Liverpool
to go through exactly the same performance,
and on the morrow, the 2nd of May, they in
their turn boarded the transport “Hororata,”
and moved off on their voyage of half-way
round the world. Perhaps the most striking
thing about this departure was the fact that
the brass band escorting this small party was
over twice the numerical strength of the party.
Who says they don’t do things properly in
Aussie ?
Two days later, bn May 4th, the first rein-
forcements to the Unit, under the command of
Captain Nisbet, boarded the “Marathon,” and
started on the trail of the other parties.
On May 11th the main body of the Ambu-
lance, with the C.O. and Head-quarters Staff,
embarked on the “Argyllshire,” and in their
turn broke paper streamers of farewell with
the densely packed crowd on the wharf.
A party of nine men, in the care of Captain
Hunter, had been left behind as an after party,
and the “Aegina,” leaving Sydney on July sth,
was the boat that carried them across the inter-
vening oceans to rejoin their mates.
All these boats, with the exception of the
“Hororata,” travelled to England via The
Cape. The exception bore her human freight
through Suez Canal to Alexandria. Here the
troops were transhipped to the “Aragon,” and
after a quick run through the Mediterranean,
reached England two weeks before the arrival
of the rest of the Ambulance.
Chapter II.
The month of August was still young when
the Ambulance claimed as its home a camp at
Lark Hill, on Salisbury Plains, almost in the
shadows of Stonehenge. Historical monu-
ments we deemed them then, but ere we bade
them “vale” we were wont to refer to them
as “The Stones.” They were the turning point
for early morning runs. We passed them almost
every day on our route marches, so it was no
wonder our interest in them and in their his-
torical value, slipped a bit.
On August Bth the Ambulance was re-organ-
ised to bring it into line with the Ambulances
of the British Army. We had left Australia in
two (A and B) section formation, and a third
(C) was now added. This necessitated a
shuffling of officers, and Captain Donovan took
over the command of “B” Section, while the
newly formed “C” Section was placed under
the care and guidance of Captain Vickers.


About this time a small Field Hospital was
opened in our Ninth Brigade lines, and it was
shortly followed by the formation of another
one to look after the sick amongst the Artillery.
Physical training, route marching and Am-
bulance work under imagined active service
conditions was the daily routine. It was neces-
sary, no doubt, but it was heavy and hard, and
it speaks volumes for the. men that they stuck it
so well as they did. For three months it went
on, and at the expiration of that time the lads
were as hard as nails, well up in their job, and
ready and willing to meet anything that might
come their way on the other side of the Chan-
nel.
Early in November a grand review of the
Division was held at Bulford, and the boys had
the chance of viewing His Majesty, King
George, at close quarters, as they marched past
the saluting base.
Afterwards, as he rode down the long line of
Aussie troops, the cheers were solid and sincere.
It was a day to be remembered. There was
only one fly in the ointment —by the time the
camp was reached there was nothing of the day
left to observe as a holiday.
It was during these days that we heard many
and varied tales of gas masks, but the oppor-
tunity of personal verification was as yet want-
ing.
The finishing 'touch was put on to our soldier-
ing, or rather we fondly imagined it was, when
we were issued with our tin hats. The photo-
graphers did rather a flourishing business for
a time, and many dinkum and daredevil photos
found their way Aussiewards.
About this time the Ambulance, which had
not been .quite up to strength in officers, was
brought right up to the mark, and Majors
Lind and Honman were added to it. The for-
mer took over the command of “B” Section,
while the latter did the same for “C” Section.
Both of these men had seen active service, and
knew at first hand the conditions under which
the work of the Unit would have to be carried
on across the water.
Under their direction and valuable advice the
Ninth gradually passed another phase of its
life’s history. Its cocoon of surmise and con-
jecture was thrown off and it emerged sprout-
ing the wings of actual knowledge, which
would soon open out and expand on arrival at
places where that knowledge would have to be
put into actual use.
The issue of the tin lids seemed to confirm the
good oil rumours that had been flowing round
amongst the men for the past few weeks, to the
effect that ere long we would be across the
water having a go at the real thing. And so
it was. The third week in November saw all
sorts of preparations being made, panniers
packed and waggons loaded. At daylight on
the morning of the 23rd the “Fall In” was
sounded on the bugle, and it was destined to be
the last fall in, as a Unit of untried, we were
to hear on English soil. Entraining at Ames-
bury we were soon at our port of embarkation,
Southampton, arriving there at 10 a.m. A weary
wait of ten hours followed before we were
allowed to go on board the transports. The
Unit made the crossing on two boats. The
main portion had space on the old paddle-
wheeler “Mona’s Queen,” and the transport
occupied portion of the “Bellerophon.”
It was a miserable, cold, rainy night, and a
strong wind made the waters of the Channel
play up to some tune. Those few hours on the
water will linger long in our memories. Every-
body was sea-siek and full realisation came that
a soldiers lot, when on a Channel transport,
was not a happy one.
The French port of Le Havre was reached
in safety, and before nightfall the men were in
their allotted lines in the rest camp. A march
next morning ended with the making of our
first bow to a continental troop train, and
gave us the opportunity of reading for the first
time on the outside of our carriage the legend
“Chevaux 8, hommes 40.” Since then we
have read it many times, and never once has
it been pleasurable reading. The carriages
alluded to were cattle trucks; just cattle trucks
of the common kind and were far from clean.


When forty men with their gear and equipment
got inside there wasn’t much room for anything
else. On the journey, of course, sleep was a
negligible quantity. We entrained at 1 p.m. on
Saturday, the 25th, and it was our home till we
detrained at Bailleul at 9 o’clock on the Mon-
day morning.
The train journey was the slowest and most
uncomfortable thing we had struck to date, and
will never be forgotten.
Fortunately the weather was on our side, and
though it was cold, we had glimpses of the sun
at intervals.
Occasionally, so slow was the journey, we were
able to get out and walk along to stretch
our cramped legs, and we had opportunities of
trying on the inhabitants of the towns and vil-
lages we passed through en route, our book
learned French.
OVER THERE.
Chapter III.
On the Monday morning we arrived at
Bailleul and the detraining was only a matter
of minutes. Leaving the transport to follow on
afterwards, we did a Tommy route march, or
in other words, rode in motor lorries, to our
first fixed home in France—the schoolhouse at
Steenwerck.
A Field Hospital was established straight
away to cater for the arriving troops, and next
morning gas masks were issued and instruc-
tions were given in their use. We accepted
with a grain of salt the instructor’s remark
that the mask was our best friend, but after-
experience taught us that such indeed was the
case.
Next day I remember the men of B and C
Sections listened to a few words very much
to the point, from their officers, while A Section
with full packs up did a route march. There
had been some small breach of discipline, and
out of mole hills mountains might grow.
At least that was what the “Powers that
Be” thought—what the men thought was a
different matter. The strange thing about it
was that A Section should be picked on. Why,
they were known among the boys as “The
King’s Own,” because they were the C.O.’s
own Section. C Section (‘‘The Queen’s Own”)
would not think of earning punishment, but
B Section (‘‘The Devil’s Own”) were not even
blamed, and they might be guilty of doing any-
thing those days.
The 28th of November was really the start
of dinkum doings, as far as we were concerned,
for on that day some of the men, squads of
bearers from A Section, went forward to take
up duties, bearing from Square Farm R.A.P.
on the Armentieres front. From there they had
to carry the wounded back through the com-
munication trench to the Left Advanced Dress-
ing Station, situated in what had been in pre-
war days a strongly-built tile kiln.
Another party of the men, selected from “C”
Section and under the command of Major Ilon-
inan, proceeded to Pont Nieppe, and occupying
portion of an abandoned jute factory on the
bank of the River Lys, set going a Divisional
Baths. The baths themselves were huge vats,
and as the supply of water was practically un-
limited, the Australian’s natural desire for a
bath was well satisfied. At this time a hitherto,
to them, unknown attachment of war, had come
under the notice of the members of the Divi-
sion. Their billets being in many cases old,
were teeming with these parasites, and even
the trenches had their full quota. They, the
insects, soon got wise to the value of the warm
Australian blood as a food and their host woke
up to the fact that he wanted to scratch. A
visit to the “divvy” baths, where he could get
a clean change of underclothing, have a warm
bath and have his tunic and pants ironed, was
the remedy, and right gladly did the boys avail
themselves of it.
It was here we first became acquainted with
a notice that has been ever present before our
gazes since. Special baths, dinkum baths, were
set apart for officers. Each compartment was
hessianed off from observation and promi-
nently placed on the outside was the sign “For
Officers Only.” We have seen that sign, no
matter where we found ourselves in the back
areas. They were not necessary in the forward


posts, for there the difference was advisedly not
so striking. We have seen that sign, when on
leave, far away from everything savouring of
war. Ilow'' many of us, when, strangers in
a strange land, endeavouring to get accommo-
dation in a presumed public hostelry, have been
knocked back with the news, that the house had’
certainly vacant beds, but they were “for
officers only.” Many an Aussie private, arriv-
ing in London on leave, wffth a substantial roll
in his pocket, his first leave after perhaps
fourteen months in the muddy trenches of Flan-
ders, has caught the night train for Scotland
in disgust after having tried unsuccessfully to
get a bed. There were plenty of beds but
there had also been plenty of “Officers Only”
signs too. To free born, unconventional Aus-
tralians that odious sign did not in the least ap-
peal, and when Australia’s shores are again
reached it will certainly only exist as a memory,
as will exist many of the other hardships atten-
dant on war.
Still another tent sub-division under Captain
Donovan marched to Armentieres, and on the
morrow took over the Main Dressing Station,
which was situated in what had been a Mater-
nity hospital from a British Field Ambulance.
On the next day the Unit head-quarters, hav-
ing handed over the position at Steeifwerck to
the 11th Australian Ambulance, marched into
Armentieres and occupied the Convent of St.
Jude as billets.
The Left A.D.S. was officially taken over by
some of “A” Section bearers, and when our
motor ambulances arrived two days later, the
whole of the arrangements for the evacuation
of the wounded from the front line trenches
to the Casualty Clearing Station outside Steen-
werck, were in our hands.
Knocked in the front trenches, the wounded
man was carried by the regimental bearers to
the R.A.P. After attention there he was car-
ried by our men back to the A.D.S. —during the
day time tln-ough the communication trench,
but at night, overland by road. Receiving fur-
ther attention there at the hands of one of our
medical officers, he was loaded on an ambulance
B
and taken to our Main Dressing Station at
the Maternity. There he again passed through
the surgeon’s hands, and was eventually loaded
on another ambulance car and was soon passed
on to the C.C.S. There you have the earlier
stages of the long line of evacuation that ended
for some of its travellers, at the Base, for some
in Blighty, and for others in far away Aus-
tralia.
About this time a new game was added to
the many that an A.M.C. man has to play.
All spare men not occupied in such necessary
duties as tire or gas picquets received orders
to report to the 3rd Sanitary Section for duty.
Their job turned out to be what they aptly
designated as “sparrow starving.” This meant
cleaning all garbage from the streets and foot-
paths. The inhabitants had left hurriedly and
had not cleaned up before their exodus. When
collected the garbage was removed in trans-
port waggons, also supplied by us, to huge in-
cinerators and there burned. Our fellows
tackled the distasteful work and did it well.
On December 10th bearers from “B” Section
relieved the “A” Section bearers, and took
over the Brick Kiln A.D.S. and the Square
Farm R.A.P. It was on this date that the
enemy did a bit of shelling town-wards, and
some of the projectiles dropped near the billets
and the battered church in Half Past Eleven
Square. It was at the latter place that one
Australian soldier was killed and several
wounded. It appeared, that he who had paid
the price, had failed to throw himself down
when the shells came and the lesson therefrom
was so well learned by the Ambulance men that
“get down” developed into quite a common
saying.
On December 12th, early in the morning, an
excited motor orderly stirred things into super-
life at the M.D.S., and the staff hastened to
attend to the first member of the Unit to get
in the way of a piece of German flying iron-
mongery. Captain Vickers, while going through
the trenches near Square Farm, had been un-
lucky, and a piece of shell easing had entered
his back.


The remainder of the month went on with
its usual sick parades, its usual daily dribble
of wounded men from the line. During these
days not only had our bearers to carry out
all wounded men, but any men who were killed
had also to be out by them. This not only
meant the weakening of the bearer posts to
cope with possible eventualities, but it also
meant exposing the bearers to needless risk.
It was some time before the Authorities saw
things in this light. Later on, however, the
arrangement was knocked on the head, and a
point that had been the cause of much adverse
criticism and comment was done away with.
Chapter IV.
Christmas Comforts had happened along in
time and were distributed by the C. 0., accom-
panied by a handshake and a good wish. In
the latter war days we collected them when
they were available, personally, from the
Quarter-Master’s Store. Time always does
bring its changes.
On the last day of the old year the A.D.M.S.,
Colonel White, paid us a visit of inspection,
and as there was no “letter from the King”
afterwards, it is fairly safe to say that he was
well satisfied with the Unit.
The first three weeks of the new year passed
without strange happenings. We were just
merely carrying on. On the 26th the
sector held by our Division was lengthened,
and another A.D.S. situated at Chapelle Armen-
tieres, in what had once been a brewery, was
taken over by part of “A” Section. Squads
of bearers, working in twenty-four hour shifts,
were dispatched to Cowgate and Wellington,
the two R.A.P. ’s feeding the new A.D.S. From
both these posts the cases had to be carried
for some distance, from Cowgate through
trenches and from Wellington across country
to the road, where the stretchers were placed
on wheels and thus taken to the dressing sta-
tion.
On the last day of the month the bearers of
the Right A.D.S. were reinforced in prepara-
tions for a raid to be made against the enemy
by the 40th Battalion. They were not needed,
however, as the casualties sustained by our
lads were only slight.
About this time the R.A.P., known as Welling-
ton, which was right in the support trenches,
came under more than its usual share of shell
fire, and had to be abandoned. A new R.A.P.
was opened up further back, and was named
Wellington No. 2.
Prom this time up to about the middle of
February there was nothing of special interest
to chronicle. The usual quota of sick and
wounded passed through the hands of the Am-
bulance, and the otherwise unemployed bearers
occupied their time in the ordinary fatigues of
carrying water and collecting firewood from
houses partly demolished by enemy shell fire.
The winter was exceptionally severe, and for
the greater part of the time snow lay thick on
the ground. Outside conditions were alto-
gether miserable and hard, and it stands on
record how grandly our bearers came through
the trying ordeals of their period of probation
when all things, even nature, were against
them.
On February 11th there happened the first
operation of magnitude that the Ambulance
lads took a forward part in. It was an exten-
sive raid on the right sector of our front, and
the Tyneside Scottish troops on our right took
a leading part in it. As usual with them they
fought magnificently, but in the doing, suffered
heavy casualties. Our preparations were well
made, and the evacuation of the wounded was
carried out without a hitch. Major Lind and
his “B” Section tent men were at the M.D.S.
We had extra batches of personnel at the right
and left A.D.S.’s. Extra bearers were sent to
the R.A.P’s., and a motor and horse Ambulance
loading post was established at Suicide Corner.
The arrangements for coping with the
wounded at the M.D.S. were perfect. Loaded
cars coming from the line reached the Matern-
ity from the rear, through the grounds to the
Civil Hospital. They were unloaded and the
patients taken in through one of the large fold-


ing windows in the eastern ward. The empty
car then left the grounds by the front entrance.
Moving thus in a circle gave rise to no conges-
tion, and the delay in unloading was reduced to a
minimum. Once inside the eastern ward the
patient was seen by a medical man and marked ,
for operating theatre or otherwise. Ills par-
ticulars were taken, and by the time he reached
the western or evacuating ward his hurts had
been attended to, and he had his completed
Field Medical Card attached to him.
The empty cars waiting to convey patients
to the C.C.S. were loaded through one of the
windows from the west ward, and when full
moved off through the front gate to the road.
Thus everything moved in a circle and there
was no chance of a hitch occurring. The way
the stunt was handled certainly pleased the
A.D.M.S., Colonel White, who paid a visit of
inspection to the M.D.S. when . things were
busiest. In the earlier hours of the stunt it
appears that our C.O. had been asked by Colonel
White, per telephone, how things were going,
and his reply deserves to be handed down to
history.—“My machine is working splendidly.”
This was the first time we were in a position to
judge the fighting abilities of the Scotch. The
opinion that we formed then, that they were
bonny scrappers, we have never since had
occasion to change.
The next military event was another raid on a
large scale on the Houplines, or left Sector.
Another Field Ambulance had charge of the
evacuations, but a big party of our bearers
under a staff sergeant was attached to it for the
stunt. Only very few of the wounded came
through our posts and there were no casualties
amongst our boys. From a military point of
view the affair was a complete success. When
things had quietened down our men reported
back to Head Quarters and things went on as
before.
Some time previous to this our officer
strength had been added to by the arrival of
Captain Bartram, transferred to us from the
Artillery. He was afterwards doomed to number
amongst those who ranked as Brass Hats and
acted as Members of the Administrative Staff.
The Ambulance certainly proved to be an ex-
cellent training ground for future official
greatness.
The next event of importance to happen
was an issue of new pay-books, and two days
afterwards a new Divisional Baths was opened
up by “C” Sections at Erquinghem.
On March Btli the Right A.D.S. was taken
over by the 57th British Ambulance, and our
men reported back to Head Quarters at the
Convent St. Jude. The next day the 11th Aus-
tralian Field Ambulance relieved us at the Left
A.D.S. and at the M.D.S. Maternity.
This gave opportunity for a full muster
parade of the Ambulance, the first since our
active service had started, which was held next
day. The next morning a kit inspection was
the order of the day. I might mention inci-
dentally that these kit inspections right through,
out the piece forms one of the delights of the
Australian Soldier in the Great War. That
afternoon a preparatory marching out stunt
was held. A muster parade in full marching
order and an inspection of the vacated billets by
Major Lind was part of the scheme. Let a veil
be drawn over the remarks the Major made
when he had completed the said inspection.
They were forcible, short, sharp, to the point
and meant. The R.S.M. still asserts that his
ears tingled for a week afterwards.
For the three days following, the state of
things was “As you were”, but on the fourth
day the Unit got a move on and bade farewell
to Armentieres. We have not seen it since
but we always regarded it as a home, and we
have followed the things that happened in and
around it in the latter days of the war with
very much interest.
Chapter V.
Our trek was not a long one, for our des-
tination, Pont Nieppe, was only a few kilos
away. Arriving there we took over from a New
Zealand Field Ambulance the Main Dressing
Station and Hospital being run by them in


the convent school rooms behind the village
church. “B” Section tent sub. were placed in
charge. Bearers from the same section with
a cou[>le of dressers attached, and with Captain
Meehan in charge, took over the Brewery
A.D.S. situated near Ploegsteert. This, as the
name implies, was a dismantled brewery. It
seemed to be our luck to be associated with
breweries, but it was always after the business
had been closed down for some considerable
time. Two squads of bearers were stationed
at Lawrence Farm R.A.P., and one squad at
Despierre Farm R.A.P.
A motor loading post was established at
Motor Car Corner, near Le Bizet, and two
squads of bearers from “A” Section were al-
lotted to Surrey Farm R.A.P. The A.D.S. at
Charing Cross was run by the New Zealand
Ambulance for the time being, but our cars
evacuated the wounded and we reinforced the
post by squads of our bearers. They took their
turn at manning the R.A.P.’s feeding Charing
Cross. These were four in number: Dead Horse
Corner, Prowse Point, Rifle House and Wan-
tage Hall.
This was the first but by no means the last
time we have been thrown into touch with the
men from New Zealand. To meet them was like
meeting brothers in a strange land. What
was theirs was ours, given freely and unre-
servedly. They were always ready to assist
us. always ready to do more than their bit.
Our opinion of them has always been of the*
very highest, and right throughout the game
our infantry boys have thought as we have
thought. Never has it been known, they say.
that any of them have been left in a hole when
the N.Z.’s were anywhere about, and it was
humanly possible to be extricated. Good com-
rades, good mates, good fellows, and fighters
of the super-highest order, is the verdict of the
“diggers” of Australia on their brother “dig-
gers” from New Zealand.
On the 18th of the month there was a tour
of inspection by Lieut.-Gen. Godley. and he
never said a word.
The next week passed uneventfully, but it
ended by the war coming much closer to the
M.D.S. Fritz dropped a few shells in its im-
mediate neighbourhood, and Pte. Jim O’Sulli-
van, a keen souvenir hunter, and the first of
the “O.R.’s” to get a knock, stopped a piece
of flying shell with his wrist, and was
evacuated.
What had been a quiet sector previous to the
advent to the trenches of the Australians, soon
woke up, and things started to move. There was
some raid or other every night, and the stream
of wounded handled by the Ninth was a steady
one.
When not engaged in the legitimate jobs of
caring for sick or wounded, there were always
other jobs for the boys. The principal one
amongst them was the gathering of material to
make roads at a huge dressing station, then in
course of erection further down along the road
towards Bailleul. A party of thirty or forty men
under the charge of an N.C.0., was daily
marched from the billets to the war-wrecked
suburb of Armentieres, Ilouplines. There they
finished the job the enemy shells had started, and
gathered together huge heaps of bricks, whole
and otherwise. These were transported by night
in our G.S. Waggons to their new position. That
part of their career the boys should forget, for
they proved themselves to be champion home-
wreckers those days.
Right throughout the months of treatment of
the sick and wounded, the greatest care and at-
tention was given to cases, and no stone was ever
left unturned to start them safely back on the
road to recovery.
In many instances the task was well nigh hope-
less, but still no effort was spared.
I remember on one occasion, whilst we were
at this station, a wounded British Officer was
brought in. He was a serious case. He was
grievously wounded, and mainly from loss of
blood, his sands of life were slowly but surely
sifting away. The doctors in charge of the case
knew that there was only a very remote chance
for him. If the blood he had lost could be re-
placed there were hopes, though faint, that he
would pull through.


THE SHELLED IU * A! * FROM HKD LuDGK, I‘LOKGSTKKRT.


They called for volunteers, but it was not
necessary; for the orderly on duty at the time,
Ronny Hill, offered himself, and soon his warm
Australian blood was flowing into the blood chan-
nels of his shattered fellow being. The sacrifice,
made willingly, without any hope of reward, was
not without avail, for when the wounded man
was sent on to C.C.S the next day, he had turned
the corner, and only needed the careful nursing
he was sure to get further back, to pull him
through.
The month of April was ushered in by heavy
strafing by the enemy, of the ground near Char-
ing Cross A.D.S. The main road was badly
damaged by shell fire, and it was there that Ser-
geant Sammy Crook (he since has made the
Great Sacrifice) gained the Military Medal, the
first distinction to be gained by a member of the
Ambulance.
Within a week the war was brought very close
to us, for on Easter Sunday we lost three of our
men, killed by the one shell. L.-Sgt. Gus Dyer
and Ernie Porter, of the Quarter-Master's Staff,
and Driver James Bridson, were returning from
Charing Cross after delivering the rations, and
had almost reached Ploegsteert, when a shell
burst right at the side of the vehicle. The three
men were killed, while, marvellous to relate, the
two horses were hardly touched, and were-able
to bring home the waggon, the wheels and under-
carriage of which were quite sound. The event
cast a gloom over the whole of the Ambulance,
for the three who had “gone west” were three
of the best, and three we could ill afford to lose.
Our thoughts, as we stood round their open
graves the next day in the little cemetery at Pont
Nieppe, were sad ones, but we knew they had
suffered that which they were prepared to meet,
and that though away from us in person, they
would always be present in our memories.
The next fortnight was passed just merely
carrying on. There was nothing unusual to
chronicle.
After having been reinforced from the Base,
on the 22nd the Unit moved off to the nearly-
completed Dressing Station on the Bailleul Road
at Pont D’Aschelles, and set it going in prepar-
ation for the great.work which was to be done
in the near future.
It was a good “possy, ” and numerous well-
built Nissen huts, both large and small, served
as reception rooms, dressing rooms, wards, etc.
Duck boards tracks, leading everywhere, kept
one out of the mud. A well-made road, built in
a curve and named Boomerang Street, gave entry
and exit for the Motor Ambulances. We had
not been there long before most things assumed a
dash of far-away Australia. It certainly showed
where our thoughts were. Even the surface pool
where our horses watered, had its neatly-painted
sign, on which one might read, “Our ’Arbour.”
Whitewash, aptly named by some of the boys,
‘ ‘ eye wash, ’ ’ was much in evidence. Everything
about the place, even the duck board tracks, was
edged with it.
Huge quantities of extra blankets, stretchers,
and medical comforts began to arrive, and we
knew by these portentious signs that we were on
the eve of big events.
On the last day of April we had an oppor-
tunity of recording our votes for the Federal
Elections out Home.
That night the enemy thought fit to make a
raid on the Charing Cross Sector, and though he
was beaten back, he caused a number of casu-
alties amongst our troops. The bearers were
busy for some hours, but the wounded were
handled expeditiously, and there was no delay
along the line of evacuation.
From the morrow the Dressing Station at Pont
D’Aschelles took on the title of Corps Main
Dressing Station.
On the night of the sth, shells began *t> arrive
in the vicinity of the Hospital, and shrapnel
pellets made music on the tin roofs of the Nissen
Huts. The order was given to remove patients,
and they were successfully removed to a farm
house across the adjoining fields. When things
had quietened down, they were brought back
none the worse for their hurried removal.
Things went on in their usual groove for some
days, but on the nineteenth the sad news reached
us that one of our officers, Major Ilonman, had
succumbed to the effects of enemy gas. He was


the first of our officers to meet his end on active
service. He had not been with us long, but long
enough to make us know that our loss was great
and that he would be hard to replace.
Towards the end of May, drafts of men, both
bearers and nurses, arrived at Pont D’Aschelles,
and were attached in preparation for the hap-
penings of the near future. These preparations
went on apace. Huge supplies of dressings were
got ready. One of the larger Nissen huts was
specially set out and equipped for the reception
of gas cases only.
Meanwhile, some of the men, under the super-
vision of Engineer N.C.O.’s, and assisted by a
draft of men from another Ambulance, were
hard at work erecting concrete and sandbag
dugouts on the Messines Road, just beyond Hyde
Park Corner. There were five of these dug-outs
in all, two of them to be used as rooms for dress-
ing the wounded, and the three smaller ones as
quarters for the personnel. That they were
faithfully built was more than proved within a
very few days.
Chapter VI.
On the first day of June a munition dump at
Hyde Park Corner blew up, and there were many
casualties. Some of the Ninth who were at work
on the dug-outs further up the road were soon
on the spot, and the wounded were safely re-
moved to the A.D.S. at Charing Cross.
Preparatory to taking up their forward
positions, all the bearers and “B” and “C” tent
subdivisions had their gas masks and identifi-
cation discs inspected, and received instructions
in “How to make a Will.” There were a few
who regarded the proceeding in all seriousness,
but the majority treated it as another little joke.
On the sth the bearers were told off to their
posts, and set out to take up their positions that
afternoon. They were followed by “B” tent
subdivision, who, with “C” tent Sub. now hold-
ing the post, were to carry on the forward Divis-
ional Collecting Post in the newly-erected dug-
outs on the Messines Road. Major Lind had
charge of this post, and was assisted by Captains
Hunter and Bartram, and later on by Captain
Watson.
New in the game, and as things went then,
we thought this was a pretty hot spot. We have
been in hotter, much hotter, spots since.
The Corps Main Dressing Station at Pont
D’Aschelles, under the command of Lieut.-Col.
Maguire, with some of his own officers, assisted
by officers from other Ambulances, had every-
thing up to the knocker, and all things prepared
to handle casualties up to almost any number.
That his preparations were well made was soon to
be proved. For the twenty-four hours from 3
a.m., June 6th, to 3 a.m., June 7th, during the
battle of Messines, 6,500 cases, including 3,500
stretcher cases, were treated and passed through
the station. A very fine performance when we
remember also that close on 400 gas cases had to
be treated during the night of the sth.
The forward area these days was never quiet,
and the air was always full of the sound of the
guns. The enemy’s observation was well nigh
perfect, and in places he could see almost every-
thing happening in and behind our lines.
Our men on many occasions had good reason
to remember this. Once in the trench known as
“The Only Way,” a glimmering candle in the
hands of a bearer to light the distribution of
some purloined cake, gave rise to a barrage of
whizz bangs. Jerry seemed to never sleep, but
was always alert, always ready to open up on
anything strange.
He was strong in Artillery, and used that
portion of his strength to the utmost. Especially
was this evident throughout the whole of the day
preceding the Messines Battle, the fire becoming
even more intense as night came on. As we
viewed his bursting shells from any old “possy”,
we mentally remarked, “Carry on, Jerry, your
time is getting very short now. ’ ’ Every imagin-
able kind of shell was coming over. Ploegsteert
Wood and the lower-lying portions of the roads
of approach were absolutely flooded with gas—
both phosgene and tear gas. As it was by these
means of approach our undaunted infantry had
to make its way to the place of hopping off in
the morning, the casualties from this cause were

heavy. The marvel is that they were able to get
up at all. That they did succeed, history knows
full well. Ere another day had died they had
done the big part in decisively beating the enemy
and in winning the Battle of Messines.
There was an unbroken stream of gas cases,
with here and there an occasional wounded man,
through our Collecting Post and A.D.S.’s back
to Pont D’Aschelles. For hours this went on
practically without a break, and only eased off
in the early hours of the morning of the 6th.
The easing off, however, was not for long, for
at ten minutes after 3 in the morning, Hell broke
loose. Our massed Artillery, hitherto lying low
like Brer Fox, went off as one thing; the mines
that had been so many weeks in preparation
blew up, and we knew that out there in front,
our Infantry men were crossing No Man’s Land
to come to grips at last with that enemy they had
been watching for so long.
It was the commencement of the battle, and
how great was the victory is for other scribes to
tell.
It was hardly full daylight before the first of
the battle casualties started to arrive, and in
ever growing strength the flow continued for
hours. It was well past midday ere things
slackened off, but right throughout there had
been no hitch. The bearers had done their job
as everyone knew they would. The advanced
posts had worked at high tension, starting their
cases back with a minimum of delay, and at the
Corps Main Dressing Station there had been no
congestion. Every case had been quickly yet
thoroughly attended to and cared for, and there
was no cause for complaint. In the operating
theatre four tables were kept constantly busy,
whilst the road to C.C.S at Bailleul was kept
evenly trafficked.
At all the posts, that grand organisation, the
Y.M.C.A., made its presence felt. Assisted in
the labour by the members of the Divisional
Pierrot Concert Party, it was on the spot at every
dressing post with the hot cocoa and biscuits and
cigarettes so dear to the average Aussie. Every
man passing through had his hot drink, some
biscuits to chew, and the big majority were
carried away contentedly puffing at a good Aus-
sie fag. In every engagement since, it has been
the same, and the Y. Emma stands very high in
the estimation of the “Diggers.”
Our casualties during the battle were not nu-
merous, but two of our boys, whom we could ill
spare, paid the great price. Staff-Sergeant Dis-
penser Jack Hosking and Pte. Waddell, while at-
tending to wounded men outside the Messines
Road, D.C.P., fell victims to the one shell.
Though everything was done for them and they
were rushed away by car to the Casualty Station,
it was of no avail, and they are amongst the
many who lie in lonely graves in France.
The following days were passed much in the
ordinary way. The usual clearing up business
that follows every stunt had to be gone through.
Occasionally the forward positions were subjected
to enemy shell fire, and on two occasions the
personnel at the D.C.P. had to retire to the
catacombs under Hill 60 for protection, while
one of the Unit Ambulance Cars was put out of
action by flying pieces of shell when awaiting a
load of wounded at Charing Cross.
Chapter VII.
On June 15th the Ambulance was relieved by
the 3rd New Zealand Field Ambulance and
moved to a camp near .Neuve Eglise. After
twenty-four hours’ rest there, it continued its
, march to Doulieu, where a Brigade Field Hos-
pital was started by “C” Section. Two days
afterwards the whole of the Ninth Brigade was
inspected and ' addressed by Lieut.-General
Godley.
A'week’s rest at Doulieu saw us again trek-
king, this time to taka over the Main Dressing
Station •at Westhoff Farm from the 77th
R.A.M.C. Ambulance. The personnel were bil-
leted here, at first under canvas, but later on in
huts. The usual number of sick and wounded
passed through our hands, the only marked in-
crease being when bombs from enemy night-
flying aeroplanes, which visited us every night,
caused casualties. On one Sunday morning, the
24th I think, enemy shells started to scream


over, and one of them burst right in the middle
of: a barn in which the few remaining civilians
of the neighbourhood were attending church.
The building was completely wrecked, and many
of the; old men and women and children forming
the congregation: were killed dr wounded. Some
of the boys were quickly on the spot rendering
first aid, and our cars soon had the sufferers at
Westhoff Dressing Station receiving medical
attention.
At the end of the month, Lieut.-General Godley
held a parade about a kilo away for the pur-
pose of awarding the medals won by the Ninth
Brigade during the Messines operations. A
D.C.M. for S.-Sgt. Grey, and Military Medals
for Sgt. Lee and Ptes. Hartley, Allardice, West,
Witt and Jarvis came our way.
Early in July, some of the bearers and Ambu-
lance Cars were sent on to Kandahar Farm to
assist the 11th Australian Field. Ambulance.
There was constant heavy enemy shelling on
this sector, and for a time Ambulance traffic was
held up owing to the road having been badly
damaged and rendered impassable by shell fire.
On July 11th the Westhoff Station was taken
over by the 11th Field Ambulance, and “A”
Section of the 9th took over the Divisional Rest
Station at Bailleul, while “B” and “C” Sec-
tions did likewise at L’Estrade from the 10th
Australian Field Ambulance.
This was rather a memorable event, for it was
the first time we had done back work since
landing in France.
Our seven months of forward work without a
break was deserving of a spell in the back area.
The position at Bailleul was 0.K., but the
L’Estrade one called urgently for improvement.
There was plenty of work ahead to knock it into
shape, and in this, as in other things, the Ambu-
lance did its job.
The bursting of enemy bombs in Bailleul was
a nightly occurrence, and at times some big
stuff in the shell line came whistling over. Not
much damage to life was done, and a few extra
shell holes in the buildings were not to be
noticed.
" The only event noticeable during the next
fortnight was the dispatch of a number of the
personnel to the No. 2 A.C.C.S. for duty, and
the sending forward of representative bearers
from each section to Kandahar Farm, to acquire
at first hand a knowledge of the various posts
on that front, with the roads and tracks for
approach and evacuation for future reference.
On the night of the 23rd, enemy aeroplanes
attacked with bombs the No. 2 Casualty Clear-
ing Station, where all the patients were under
canvas. A huge red cross was prominently dis-
played, and so obviously was it an hospital that
the presumption that his attack was a cold-
blooded, deliberate one must hold. One of our
lads, Pte. Joe Cox, on ward duty at the time,
always inoffensive, always a ready and willing
worker, was amongst those killed. For a lad
like him, who had run the trenches from Law-
rence Farm to Cowgate at all hours of the day
and night, not knowing even what fear was, to
lose his life thus, was indeed hard.
On the 18th the Ambulance had moved for-
ward and taken over the D.R.S. at Ravelsberg
from the Ist New Zealand Ambulance, with “B”
Section doing the nursing duties. Here, as in
most of the places where the caravan of the
Ambulance has rested in France or Belgium,
extensive improvements ..were, needed and were
promptly started. I sometimes wonder, these
days, how many brick ovens alone the Ambu-
lance built while on active service. At the
moment I can call eight to mind, and I know
there must have been more.
Rumours of an approaching stunt were float-
ing round, and on the second last day of the
month the bearers from each section were sent
forward to assist the bearers of the 10th Field
Ambulance.
They were stationed at Advanced Fanny,
Fanny No. 2, Whizz Bang Farm, and Wolverg-
hem on the left Sector, and at German Dug-out,
Cross R.A.P., Sunken Road, and two other un-
named posts on the right.
From these places the wounded were passed
back to Kandahar Farm M.D.S., and thence to
the C.C.S. at Bailleul, a percentage finding their
way to Ravelsberg.


On the next day the Australian forces at-
tacked, their objective being to obtain a position
in front of Warneton. The stunt was entirely
successful, but the casualties were heavy. Dur-
ing the night rain came down in torrents and
made the task of the transportation of the
wounded by the bearers an extremely arduous
one. The trenches were flooded and could not
be used. Patients had to be carried overland
through almost continuous enemy shelling, back
to Gooseberry Farm on the left and to a spot
some distance from Sunken Road on the right,
where they were placed on the light railway for
transportation to the Motor Loading Post fur-
ther back. Once on the cars they were soon back
at Kandahar.
After carrying out their duties for forty-eight
hours, our bearers were relieved and reported
back to Unit Headquarters at Ravelsberg.
Four days afterwards the 11th Field Ambu-
lance took over the post in Bailleul and our per-
sonnel who had staffed it returned to their Unit.
The next three weeks were occupied by usual
hospital and camp duties, the only break being
a lecture by Archdeacon Ward on the subject
of Venereal Diseases.
Chapter VIII.
On the 21st we handed Ravelsberg over to the
13th Australian Ambulance, and moved off for
our first spell away from the game of war. En-
training at Steenweerck, we proceeded by train
to Wizernes, via St. Omer. Hopping out there,
we marched to Ouve Werquin, and found that
we had the honour of being the first Australian
Unit to visit this part of France.
There had been some hitch in the move, but
things were straightened out two days later,
when we changed with the 11th Ambulance and
took over their positions at Ecuire. Here billets
were found for the men in barns and farm
buildings, and a field hospital for the brigade
was opened up in an empty farm house.
From here a party of fifteen men were de-
tailed to assist at No. 37 C.C.S. at Godwaers-
velde, and after carrying on there for some time
they were transferred to No. 1 A.C.C.S. at
Outersteen. They rejoined the Unit at Whi-
tt izele, after the march thereto, but in time to
take part in the operations.
We saw the month out, just merely carrying
on and indulging in cricket and football, and a
certain amount of training for the approaching
Unit sports.
These were held on September 12th, and a
perfect day, as French days go; a wet canteen
on the ground, and the music of the 36th Infan-
try Band, all tended to make the outing a splen-
did success. Sgt. Williams, he of the silvei
tones, whose voice has caused, I guess, a few
heart flutters before and since, annexed most of
the principal events. During the afternoon,
visitors in the persons of the A.D.M.S. Colonel
White and Major Lind, now D.A.D.M.S. of the
4th Division, honoured us with their presence.
Two days after the sports some of “B” Sec-
tion tent subdivision were sent to Fardingham,
on the sea coast, between Boulogne and Calais,
to act as Medical Detail to a newly established
rest camp. After a week they were relieved by
some of the “C” Section and got back to Ecuire
in time for a divisional stunt in the form of an
inspection and march-past of the whole of the
Third Division by Field Marshall Sir Douglas
Haig.
Fresh from their successes of Houplines, Mes-
sines and Warneton, the “Divvy” made a good
showing, and the Field Marshall issued a rather
unusual number of bouquets in Routine Orders
the next day.
The next few days were put in in prepar-
ations. We were old enough soldiers by this time
to recognise that a visit and inspection by one
of the “Mighty” was generally the forerunner
of a job. This instance was no exception. On
the morning of the 26th we set out with full
packs up on that long, long trail, that was to end
at Ypres.
The end of the first day saw us about twenty
miles from our starting point, and we found
billets in a town not far from Arques. The next
day we journeyed some twenty-six miles to
Godeswaervelde, and were billeted in barns. On

the morrow came a stage of some sixteen miles
ending up at Winnizele, where we were rested
for twenty-four hours and submitted to the usual
pre-stunt inspection of gas masks and identity
discs.
During the march we marched as a division,
and our motor and horse ambulances were in
attendance to pick up any of the infantry of our
own brigade who might fall out by the wayside.
A hospital was opened each night at our stop-
ping places for the care and attention of the
sick.
On the last day of the month, the bearers
under the charge of Major Williams, were eon-
■veyed by motor lorries to Ypres, via Poperinghe,
to take up their base at The White Chateau on
the Zonnibeke Road, which branched to the left
from the Main Menin Road. Later on the re-
mainder of the Unit got a move on, and also
travelling by motor lorires, journeyed to Ypres,
where they took over an M.D.S. in the ruins of
what had once been the magnificent Prison of
the City.
We had always longed to see the much fought
for Ypres. Now we wish to forget it.
The allotment of the bearers to the different
posts was a somewhat difficult matter, but diffi-
culties in this war game were made to be sur-
mounted, and so it was in this case. “A”
Section men went to Bavaria House and Frost
House, at the latter place being attached to the
Ambulance running that post. “C” Section
were manning two intermediate relay posts and
evacuated cases from there to Bavaria House.
“B” Section bearers were working from the
R.A.P. at Brigade Head Quarters, and after-
wards from Mitchell’s Farm to the relay posts
and between another R.A.P. in Potsdam Wood
and the relays. After reaching Bavaria House
the wounded were conveyed by Motor Ambu-
lance to the White Chateau A.D.S., thence to
the M.D.S. at Ypres Prison, and thence to the
C.C.S at Poperinghe.
The work of getting the wounded out of the
line and back to the dressing stations was ex-
tremely difficult. The weather, though not in its
worst mood, was not propitious. The enemy,
angered at a reverse, for, from a military view-
point the stunt had been very successful,
drenched the back areas and tracks over which
the wounded had to be carried, with a constant
stream of shells. Through this hail of death the
bearers passed backwards and forwards with
their burdens, and the marvel was that any of
them came through untouched.
Two of our boys, good men and true, out to
do their work regardless of cost, Lance-Corporal
Rus. Jarvis and Pte. Cully, met their death
whilst actually engaged in carrying out wounded
men, and a number were wounded while simi-
larly engaged.
The bearers could not, after the engagement,
say enough about the great help they got from
the motor lorry drivers when once they had
reached the main road. These men were always
ready and willing to stop their vehicles and pick
up a freight of wounded men to be taken back
to the dressing stations.
On the 6th October the Unit was relieved by a
R.A.M.C. Ambulance, the %rd East Lancs., and
after a short march were picked up by motor
lorries and conveyed to their old billets at Win-
nizele. There they were allowed to remain at
rest for three days, being also provided with
baths and a clean change.
Chapter IX.
On the 10th of the month the order came
through to move at very short notice, and once
more we journeyed back to Ypres. Arriving
at the Prison in the darkness, they found the
British Ambulance still in occupation, and had
to scratch for sleeping billets. A short search
revealed the presence of a two-storied “maga-
sin” right opposite to the Prison, and it was
there they found temporary lodgment.
Next morning there was a muster parade of
the bearers, and after they had been inspected by
the C.O. he addressed them in a few homely
words. He told them that once more they were
to be called upon to carry out their strenuous
work under very difficult conditions. To them
had been allotted the post of honour, for the 9th


MOTiill J.OADi.ND HOST, MILM.N HOAD.


had charge of the forward operations in the
coming stunt. He reminded them of the motto
he had been proud to give them, “Do Your Job,”
and he felt sure that, no matter how hard the
work, no matter how many the difficulties, no
matter how harsh the conditions they would be
called upon to face, he would be able to say
when they were recalled from their work that
they had truly and faithfully done their job.
Afterwards the bearers were arranged in
squads of four. One hundred infantry men had
been detailed from base to assist in the coming
bearing, and these were temporarily attached to
us. One squad of our men and three squads of
the assisting infantry men were detailed to each
of the battalions of the division.
Scouts were sent out to find out the exact
position of each battalion, and to afterwards
report at the White Chateau to act as guides to
their mates en route to the battalions to which
they were to be attached.
At dusk the battalions started to move for-
ward to occupy the trenches preparatory to
“going over the top” in the morning. The
bearer squads, carrying blankets and stretchers,
followed at the rear. Single file was the order
of the march, and the tracks to be followed were
defined by white tapes as far as Zonnibeke Rail-
way Station.
After the main road had been left behind the
way lay over an area that was merely a suc-
cession of shell holes, and the guiding white
tapes twisted and turned like some long snake,
as their placers had endeavoured to pick a way
where practically no way existed. And all the
time, without ceasing or even easing for a
minute, down came that hail of enemy shell.
Many a heart drawn “Thank God” went up
from the men that night because the mud was
soft and in places waist deep, for, had the sur-
face been hard, no one would have lived to get
across that barrage zone of bursting shell. There
were many casualties, but these were mostly at-
tended to at a 4th Divisional R.A.P., and started
back.
When each battalion had reached its allotted
position, the R.M.O. established an R.A.P. —
c
nearly in every case in a captured German pill-
box. That for the 35th Battalion was at Seine
House, and that for the 36th was between Berlin
Wood and Seine House.
Relay posts were established and manned by
our men at Zonnibeke Railway Station for the
Right Sector, and at Otto Farm and Levi House
for the Left. Then, further back on the Main
Road there were Bremen House (afterwards
abandoned), Frost House, and Bavaria House,
linking up the Front with the A.D.S. at the
White Chateau.
Cases were carried from Zonnibeke Railway
Station down the railway, or rather down along
where the railway once was, to Bremen House on
the main road, and thence down the road to
Frost House.
On the left they were carried from the last
relay post at Levi House along a track known
as “K” Track to the main road at the same
place.
There was only one main road, and as this had
to carry all the transport necessary for a huge
military operation such as this was, it does not
require much stretching of the imagination to
form an idea of the congestion of traffic there
was on it. Past Frost House the road was ab-
solutely impassable for motor ambulances, and
between this and Bremen House, until that post
was abandoned, horse ambulance waggons had
to take up the running as a means of evacuation.
'After Bremen House was cut out, it became
necessary for the tired bearers to carry their
patients all the way to Frost House, and the
carry along the main road was by no means the
easiest part of the journey.
The enemy, knowing the lay of the country as
well as he did, and knowing that this road was
the only path of access to and egress from the
front area, always paid it special attention. Day
and night his big high explosive shells came
screaming over in an endeavour to do some
damage. Constant casualties were occurring, and
the road was lined with dead mules and horses
and out-of-action motor lorries, G.S. waggons
and limbers.


Our fellows naturally expected that once in
position, they would be able to get some rest that
night for the exertions of the morrow, but it
was not to be. Their predecessors in the trenches
had not done their job, and on arrival at the
posts, our men found that there were many
wounded waiting evacuation; and. in fact, many
wounded waiting out in the shell holes to be
brought in. These had to be attended to, and
the result was that the bearers were knocked up
before their own stunt started.
Right throughout the piece the weather con-
ditions had been against us, and the rain had
turned the sea of shell holes into a sea of muddy
craters, three parts full of water, clustered to-
gether as thickly as the cells in ordinary honey-
comb. The mud was —well, just Ypres mud;
and to slip from the very unsafe bank at the
edge of a shell crater meant to bog to the waist,
and perhaps deeper. It took six men to carry
out a wounded man on a stretcher, carrying
him shoulder high. Even then, at times, he
was allowed to fall, for if more than one bearer
slipped at a time—and to slip meant no recovery
—there was absolutely no chance of keeping the
stretcher up.
And the sights on the way were the sights of
death. Dead men in the grotesque positions of
sudden death, both enemy and friend, lay thick
on every hand.
All the time, never lessening, never stopping,
fell that hail of enemy shell. Everything, from
huge 12 inch stuff: to small gas shell, was coming
over, and the scream and whine of passing shell
was ever present in one’s ears.
These were the conditions under which the
stretcher bearers had to work; these were the
conditions under which the wounded were taken
back to where lay treatment that might mean
ease and recovery. Therefore, you who read
these pages—dip your lid to an infantry man
but dip it also to a stretcher bearer.
So hard and arduous was the work that the
men, fit as they were, could not stand the strain,
and it was found necessary to relieve them fre-
quently. When relieved they went back to the
prison at Ypres, where it was possible to get a
hot meal and the chance of a few hours’ rest.
At times reinforcements from the other two Am-
bulances attached to the division went forward as
reliefs. All spare men about the prison, no
matter what their usual job, nurses, dispensers,
dentists, and, in fact, all specialists, went for-
ward in their turn to act as bearers. Towards
the end of the ten days that this condition of
things lasted, when the boys were called upon
to do the almost superhuman task of keeping
the line clear of wounded men, it was a matter of
extreme difficulty to keep up the average number
of reliefs.
Each afternoon the men about the prison fell
in on muster parade and were medically ex-
amined by Major Smeal, and it w r as then that
selections were made for the next morning’s
relief party. Truly it was the survival of the
fittest. Each day the selection became harder,
and the last few batches went forward with
hearts as big as ever, but with physical strength
far from equal to the task before them. I have
every confidence in saying that there was hardly
a man out of the lot of those forward workers
who was not suffering in some way or other from
the effects of enemy gas, for gas shells were con-
stantly coming over and the deadly vapour was
everywhere.
During the operations, covering as they did
only a period of ten days, our casualty list was
a heavy one. Eight of our boys were killed and
sixteen wounded. The men whose names were
added to the Honour Roll of the 9th were Sgt.
Sammy Crook, Cpl. Joe Nankivell, Barney Fox,
Don Edser, Norm Farquhar, Jack Duggan,
Frank Hughes and Jim Steele. Eight of the
truest men that ever breathed; good comrades,
good mates, always ready to do their bit, and
they died as they had lived, nobly.
The lines of the Horse Transport were situated
at Cavalry Farm, between the A.D.S. at the
White Chateau and the Head Quarters M.D.S.
at the Prison. Here they were subjected to
almost nightly visits from German bombing
planes. During those days and nights it was
fairly obvious that the enemy held the belt for
air supremacy.

On the night of the 18th, Jerry was more than
usually busy, and succeeded in finding as a mark
the Horse Transport lines. Things were lively
while they lasted, and men and horses suffered.
One man killed and two wounded was the human
toll, but among the horses the casualties were
heavy, twenty-two being killed or wounded.
When the time came to move out, reinforcements
in the horse lines had to be obtained before a
start could be made.
In passing, mention might be made of the fact
that two of the horses, though wounded, con-
tinued drawing a water cart right through the
stunt. They had been working mates since they
had been drawn in England, and have continued
to be so ever since, on the same job, under the
care of the same man, Driver Owen Smith.
They, too, have done their job, and now, in post
war days, have been categoried for demobil-
isation purposes as both in “A” class. The
wish is pardonable that Nigger and Darkie have
the luck to strike a kind civvy boss.
Early in the operation, disaster in the way of
casualties struck us; for on the morning of the
12th a chance shell burst right in the place used
by the R.M.O. of the 34th Battalion as a Regi-
mental Aid Dost. The doctor who had left Aus-
tralia with the battalion, and by his many kind-
nesses and careful treatment had endeared him-
self to every one of the boys, was killed; and
with him his A.M.C., detail of Cpl. Ben Suther-
land and Charlie Walsh, who were on our super-
numerary list and whom we have always known
as the best and truest of mates.
On the 20th, the word floated around that we
were to be relieved, and preparations were set
on foot for our departure. That these prepar-
ations were entered into whole-heartedly goes
without saying. We had no reason to be sorrow-
ful and regretful that our stay at Ypres was
approaching its end.
We had nothing to be thankful to Ypres for,
but its effects would be with us for many days to
come, and its hateful memories would be ours
for ever. It had taken away the brightest blooms
of our Ambulance; it had left gaps in our ranks
that we knew it would be impossible to fill. The
Ambulance was not the same Unit moving out
as it had been moving in, and many months were
to pass before it took on even a semblance of its
old self. I feel that I am right in saying that
it has never been quite the same since.
On the morning of the 21st we were relieved
at all posts by the 11th Canadian Field Ambu-
lance, and marching to Ypres Railway Station,
we there entrained for Wizernes. Even here
Fritz couldn’t leave us alone, for while we were
entraining and awaiting the departure of the
troop train, he tried to find us with his big stuff.
He sent a good number over, but though they
landed fairly close to us, his luck was out, his
score in casualties was nil.
Chapter X.
Detraining at Wizernes, we marched to Ecuire
and re-occupied our old billets of some sixteen
days earlier.
It was like getting back amongst old friends
again, and the kindly French people set them-
selves to make us feel at home and forget for a
time, if possible, the days we had been through.
It took a couple of days for the Unit to settle
down. Meanwhile a Brigade Hospital had been
opened up, and our cars daily collected the sick
from the battalions. The more serious cases and
those that would take some time to get right,
were evacuated by car to the hospitals at St.
Omer. All other cases were held and treated by
us, and when sufficiently recovered, were re-
turned to their respective Units.
As was always the custom, a kit inspection of
the whole three Sections was held, and all de-
ficiencies in kit and equipment were made up.
The following days were passed as practically
days of rest and leisure, though an occasional
route march tended to keep the men fit physic-
ally. Almost every afternoon some form of sport
was entered into, principally cricket and kick-
ing the football. It was a welcome rest period,
and made the lads forget for the time their
hardships of the immediate past, and gave them
a chance to become once again something like
their former selves.


On the morning of November 9th we bade
farewell to the kindly inhabitants of the village,
and after a short march to Bridage collecting
point, were picked up by charabancs and con-
veyed to a point about three miles from Doulieu.
Beaching there shortly after nightfall we found
billets in the farms wherein we had been bil-
leted on our previous visit. As was usual at
every stop, a Brigade Hospital was opened.
Here it was placed in a Nissen hut that had been
erected in the fruit orchard attached to a farm
house.
The next day was a day of rest, and on the
morrow portion of the Ambulance moved for-
ward via Steenweerck to Pont D’Aschelles,
which was now being run by the 25th R.A.M.C.
Ambulance as a hospital on rather a large scale,
and assumed its control. The remainder of the
Ambulance marched out the next afternoon and
joined the advance party.
To leave Doulieu and its inhabitants was in-
deed a wrench for some of the members of the
Unit. I have a strong recollection of how, when
we were marching out, one of the sergeants left
the column to bid a touching forewell to a
furiously blushing fair inhabitant.
Back in the old spot, Pont D’Aschelles, we felt
quite at our ease. We had learned to regard it
as a home, as we certainly had every right and
reason to do. Had we not made its roads?
Had we not titivated its duck-board walks? Was
not “our ’Arbour” there? Had not we opened
it up for its legitimate use in this game of war?
And, lastly, did we not have control of it during
the memorable days of Messines?
It was the same old place, though now the
order of things was changed and the majority
of cases handled were sick men, not wounded,
as on the occasion of our former visit.
Here, while things were fairly quiet in the
trenches and there was not much sickness
amongst the Australian boys, we set out to have
as good a time as was possible under the con-
ditions. Owing to the activity of hostile air
craft, it was found necessary to take measures
for the safety of our patients, and nearly all the
Nissen huts occupied by patients and personnel
were revetted and sandbagged.
This extra work being finished, sport was gone
into whole-heartedly, and there was hardly an
afternoon without a football match of some kind
or other being played. A capable Indoor Games
and Amusement Committee handled their job
well, and a series of concerts, card, draught and
chess tournaments were conducted. Major
Wilson, soon to get his colonelcy and the com-
mand of an Ambulance, was O.C. of sports and
games, and most will remember the cheer that
greeted the announcement that he had won the
euchre tournament.
The night of the twenty-sixth was one that will
long be remembered by the members of the Am-
bulance. It was the night on which we cele-
brated the anniversary of the arrival of the Unit
in France. It was a night of great doing. We
made it the occasion of a banquet and a smoke
concert afterwards, and everything passed off
like one thing. Three long lines of tables were
tastefully set out in one of the larger Nissen
huts. They actually groaned under a weight of
good things, but only for a time. A tastefully
decorated stage occupied one end of the room,
and on it stood a fairly decent piano, souvenired
from somewhere or other (some of the lads were
pretty keen on souvenirs). The banquet finished
—and it took some doing—we were ready for the
second part of the programme—the smoke con-
cert.
At this stage the C.O. and officers, who had
been celebrating in their mess, put in an ap-
pearance, and as each one entered across the
stage he had to run the gauntlet of much hand
clapping and nipping wit from the body of the
hall. Amongst the visiting officers were two of
our old hands who now wore their colour patches
on their caps, Major Vickers, the D.A.D.M.S. of
our division, and Major Lind, who occupied a
similar position for the 4th Division. They cer-
tainly got the reception of the evening, especially
the latter, whose entry, after the cheering had
died away, gave rise to the spontaneous outburst
by the whole of the boys of the chorus, “Lindy,
Lindy, sweeter than sugar cane, ’' etc. They sang
it right through and meant every word of it.


Meanwhile the honoured guest stood on the stage,
and if he didn’t look at ease he certainly looked
pleased.
During the evening various toasts were hon-
oured, including that of the visitors—handled by
Sergeant Mooney—and that of the C. 0., pro-
posed by Pte. Hamblin. Majors Vickers and
Lind both responded to the former. The latter,
in his speech, made happy reference to his past
days with the Unit and admitted that, though
promotion necessitating new spheres of action
had come his way, he would much rather be back
with his old “Rough Necks” of “B” Section.
The 0.C., in replying to the toast of his health,
gave a brief resume of the history of the Unit.
He had given the Unit at its formation a motto,
“Do your job,” and he was pleased to state that
from start to finish the men had acted right up
to that motto and had nobly done their job.
He made graceful reference to the gaps in our
ranks, but he knew, he said, they were gaps only
to our sight; in our memories they did not exist
as such.
Musical items and songs filled in the remainder
of the evening, and the singing of “Auld Lang
Syne” made a pleasant ending to a very pleasant
evening.
And while we forgot for the nonce and made
merry, out there, not far away, batteries spoke
in the stillness of the night. Very lights marked
by their illuminations the way the front line
trenches ran, and the beams of searchlights wan-
dered across the sky in search of enemy aircraft.
After we had filed out into the open air and
once more remembered these things, the thought
that was uppermost in our minds was, where
we would be that night twelve months.
The next few days were passed in following
out the usual routine of the hospital. There
seemed to be a wave of sickness passing through
the troops, and the number of patients we
handled took a leap upwards. This necessitated
the opening up of more wards. About this time
one of the patients died suddenly, and this, was
the only death from sickness whilst in our hands
that we had during the total length of our active
service.
With duties completed, the spare time was
used up as before in sports and social evenings.
At one of the football matches rather a strange
happening occurred. One of the onlookers stand-
ing on the boundary line one afternoon suddenly
dropped, and after examination, was found to
have a bullet wound in the knee. Where the
shot came from was a mystery that was never
solved. The two likeliest sources were a cartridge
exploding in the incinerator, or a dropping bullet
from an aeroplane.
During the first weeks of December enemy
aircraft were especially busy, and day and night
they flew over our side of the line reconnoitring
and, when opportunity offered, dropping their
bombs.
Our dispatch rider, Pte. Ralph Denver, was
one afternoon proceeding along the road near
Baillieul on duty, when an enemy bomb did its
work only too well, and another of our boys had
“Gone West.”
Chapter XI.
Wireless messages had begun again to crackle
through the air, and once again their inter-
ceptors read the messages aright, for on the 13th
everybody was busy packing up, and on the next
day we bade farewell to old Pont D’Aschelles,
handing it over to the 7th Australian Field
Ambulance. It was really farewell, for we have
not seen it since.
A short march brought us once again to the
D.R.S. at L’Estrade, which we took over from
the sth Australian Field Ambulance.
Here we found much to do and things were
busy for a time. That particular enemy of our
soldiers' health, Scabies, was very prevalent, and
soon the accommodation for patients at our dis-
posal was stretched to the utmost. It was not
long, however, before we had a system of hot
baths installed, and by their aid and regular
treatment, the scourge was slowly but surely
overcome.
The course of things ran on as usual till
Christmas was with us. Though the weather was
bitterly cold and snow covered everything with


its spotless mantle, the day was a memorable one
in the Unit. Grand preparations had been made
for the dinner, and it was some dinner, eaten
from tables tastefully decorated by the boys who
knew so well the gentle art of bringing far-away
Australia just a wee bit nearer.
The 0.C., accompanied by his Majors, visited
the different messes and at each spoke a few
sincere words of good cheer and “had one” with
the diners.
That Christmas night in the men’s large mess
room, cleared out and decorated for the occasion,
the boys held a fancy dress ball. Where they
got the material for their costumes from, good-
ness only knows, but every character in the long
range, from a lady of the Parisian demi-monde,
to a dusky belle of the Polynesian islands, was
well got up and excellently sustained.
Knowing each member of the Unit as we did,
it was a matter of extreme difficulty to pick out
the different characters, so well were they camou-
flaged. During the evening Lieut.-Col. Maguire
had no sinecure in his task of selecting the win-
ners of the various prizes competed for.
The end of the year saw the Ambulance once
more get a move on and proceed to Ravelsberg.
“A” Section went ahead and took over the post
from a New Zealand Ambulance, and were fol-
lowed the next day by the rest of the Ambulance.
It was awful weather, snow and ice every-
where. Notwithstanding the fact that the horses’
shoes were well studded with frost cogs, it was
well nigh impossible for them to get a footing;
and the journey between the two posts, that
should have only taken minutes, took hours to
make.
At this post a Divisional Rest Station was con-
ducted, and though there were only a few
wounded men coming through as patients, our
time was fully occupied, and all available ac-
commodation taken up by the sick. Scabies,
always present with the troops, claimed many
victims, but it was only a matter of a few days
before a system of hot baths was instituted and
the scourge soon abated.
The first days of 1918 were spent in the usual
routine of hospital work, and nothing of import-
ance occurred to alter the even tenor of our way.
On the 9th a medical examination of the per-
sonnel of the Ambulance was made, following
out an order from the Authorities, who were
making a determined endeavour to stamp out
the epidemic of Scabies. Duties again, as usual,
till the 18th, when honour came to us through
our 0.C., Lieut.-Colonel Maguire. Official notice
came along of his promotion to a colonelcy and
of his appointment to the office of A.D.M.S. of
the Third Division. Merit, in his case, had not
appealed in vain. Our feelings were indeed
mixed ones. His promotion gave us pleasure,
but we were loth to see him sever his connection
with the Ambulance. He had been intimately
associated with the Unit’s life history. He it
was who had formed it nearly two years before
on the parade ground at Liverpool Camp.
Under his attentive and always just care, it had
fashioned itself in to the Unit that had done
what it had done and was still prepared and
ready to do in the days that were to be.
Pending the appointment and arrival of our
new 0.C., Major Smeal took up the duties of
Commanding Officer, but he was destined to
clutch the joy stick of the machine for a few
days only.
On the night of the 22nd the boys held one of
their accustomed concerts, and seized the oppor-
tunity of bidding vale to Colonel Maguire, and
as events turned out, also an opportune welcome
to the new 0.C., Lt.-Col. Jolley, who arrived
when the proceedings were well under way.
To Sergeants Virtue and Mooney was en-
trusted the task of voicing the sentiments of the
men. Colonel Maguire feelingly responded, and
assured us that though his new duties meant si
severance from the Ambulance, it was not a
complete severance, and he would still be with his
old Unit in spirit. Having served its purpose
as a rung in the ladder of promotion he was not
the man now to cast it aside.
Lieut.-Col. Jolley, in a few well-chosen words,
assured us that it was not his intention to alter
things. The Ambulance’s past record had shown
him that there was really nothing in it to change.
He knew his task was a hard one, to follow im-


mediately after such a competent leader as
Colonel Maguire, but he would do his best.
Songs, recitations and pianoforte selections filled
in the remainder of the evening.
The Official War Records Photographer paid
us a visit on the 26th and secured some group
pictures.
Three days later an advance party proceeded
to Westhoff Farm and took over the D.R.S. there
from the 6th Australian Ambulance. They were
followed a day later by the remainder of the
Ambulance.
Here the men found plenty of work to occupy
their time. The tent sub-divisions were busy in
the reception huts and wards, and the bearers
soon found out that many improvements and
repairs had to be effected round about the camp.
To carry out some of these improvements a
great number of bricks were necessary, and these
were procured from the ruined houses in Le
Bizet, near Ploegsteert Wood. Every day for a
fortnight our G.S. Waggons, with a loading
party, were dispatched thither.
A party of men were also detailed to assist in
the running of a Divisional Baths, known as
Palmer’s Baths, situated on the Main Road Jiot
far from Westhoff.
Thus was the first half of the month occupied.
Then came ominous signs that our time for run-
ning a rest station was fast closing in, and they
portended truly. The 19th saw “C” Section
move out to resume forward work again, by
taking over the M.D.S. at Nieppe. The re-
mainder of the Unit followed later, and Head
Quarters was established in the village of Nieppe.
The bearers of “A” and “B” Sections, with
“B” tent sub. under the command of Major
Smyth, marched to the old Brewery near Ploeg-
steert, and took over the A.D.S. there, and the
R.A.P.’s that fed it. A party from “A” Section
established a temporary A.D.S. and Ambulance
Loading Post at Motor Car Corner, and manned
the R.A.P. at Surrey Farm feeding it. Another
party from “ C ” Section took over the A.D.S. at
Red Lodge. A holding party was dispatched to
Oosthoff Farm, straight behind the Brewery
A.D.S. If the stress became too great it was the
intention to fall back from the Brewery and con-
duct the A.D.S. work at this spot.
The R.A.P. ’s forward of the Brewery A.D.S.
occupied by us were Despierre Farm and Burnt
Out Farm, while a relay post was established on
the road approaching Ploegsteert Wood.
The history of the next fortnight was practi-
cally a history of gas. Our men in the trenches
gave the enemy no respite. Taking advantage of
every wind that was blowing anywhere in the
right direction, they loosed wave after wave of
cloud gas: and all the time our batteries further
back were just simply pouring over a constant
stream of gas shells of every description.
On his part, though to work under the con-
ditions that assuredly existed in his lines during
those days, must have been to work most dis-
advantageously, Fritz’s artillery was rarely
silent. He shelled forward and back areas,
hardly ever concentrating his fire on any one
point, just scattering his death engines in the
hope of doing damage to men or guns.
On the nights of the 4th and sth of February,
successive enemy raids took place on the left
Sector. Our casualties were heavy, and a con-
stant flow of wounded passed through the Red
Lodge A.D.S. back to the Main Dressing Station
at Nieppe.
Any spare men who happened to be at the time
at the M.D.S. were sent forward to reinforce the
bearers on the Left. Even the increased num-
bers hardly sufficed to keep the line clear of
wounded men. The weather conditions were not
bad, but the roughness of the ground and the
length of the porterage made the work of trans-
porting the cases one of extreme difficulty.
On the following day the 6th Australian Am-
bulance relieved us at all posts, and we collected
at Nieppe for the night.
Chapter XII,
A short march the next morning brought us to
Steenwerck, when we entrained en route for the
Divisional Rest Area. During this journey a
rather unusual accident happened to us. When
the train had completed a considerable portion




of the journey, one of the couplings about mid-
way along became disconnected, and the rear half
of the train slowly fell back from the other half.
The engine driver, not noticing the occurrence, '
must have had eyes front, for he kept his engine
going, and when at last some of the boys man-
aged to make him hear and take notice, we had
even lost sight of our mates in the derelict.
Back-pedalling, however, soon made matters
right, and the Unit again as one body, continued
its interrupted journey. Altogether the train
had been in two pieces for over half an hour, but
fortunately the track thereabouts was fairly
level.
Arriving at Desvres, we marched to the village
of Brunembert, which was to be our home, so
rumour had it, for six weeks. Dame Rumour,
inasmuch as the length of our rest period was
concerned, was always a lying jade. The idea
was to let us enjoy a lengthy well-earned rest:
but unforseen circumstances caused a change,
and our stay in the quaint French village was
not long.
On arrival, “B” Tent Sub-division opened up
a Brigade Field Hospital in a farm outbuilding,
but the next day changed the scene of their
operations to a similar building more centrally
situated and easier of access.
For a fortnight things went on as usual. The
main part of the Unit spent its days running the
hospital and the usual camp fatigues, while a
small party was dispatched to Boulogne in charge
of a N.C.O. for special duty.
On the morning of the 15th, word flew round
the camp that the Unit had to be in readiness to
move off at an hour’s notice. The personnel were
straight away set to work cleaning up the carnp,
loading waggons, etc. At midday the “Fall In”
sounded; but after inspection the parade was
dismissed for dinner.
At 2 p.m. the “fall in” was again blown, and
the whole of the Unit, with the exception of suf-
ficient men to form a holding party for the camp
and run the hospital, accompanied by the trans-
port waggons, moved off a quarter of an hour
later for a destination unknown.
Major Smeal, previous to starting the march,
spoke to the men re the discipline to be observed
on the march and impressed on each man the ab-
solute necessity for the observance of strict
silence whilst entraining. This gave things a
most serious aspect and quite a tinge of reality.
The column advanced along the Desvres Road
for about two miles with “A” Section, Captain
Bartram in command, in the van. Here the
order “About Turn” was given, and after re-
turning for about a mile, a halt was made in a
field at the side of the road.
After a meal had been disposed of, everybody
was soon busy unloading transport waggons,
erecting tents, and preparing a camp for the
night. Next morning the camp was struck and,
after breakfast, all hands fell back on the billets
previously occupied at Brunembert.
Settling down after the false alarm, the old
routine of fatigues, sport and rest was soon re-
sumed, and the next week was thus occupied.
Early in the morning on the 22nd, the order
came through for an immediate i move,, and we
knew that the unexpected, hereinbefore i alluded
to, had happened.
The inmates of the hospital were evacuated,
some to their battalion lines, and some to the'
C.C.S., and the hospital was closed down. Im-
mediately after the mid-day meal the personnel
moved off to Lottinghem, where it was expected
the troop trains would pick the lads up.
As it had been in a previous war, someone had
blundered, and there was no train for the 9th.
There was nothing left but to make the best of
things, and the boys scratched for themselves
and spent the night as best they could. In the
morning a Staff Officer stopped a passing train
loaded with transport waggons, etc., and our
fellows found a roosting place wherever they
could.
Our destination was Castres, and reaching
there, a march brought us to Watteau, where
billets had been arranged and a hot meal pre-
pared.
On the morrow the journey south was resumed,
and after marching to an embussing point some
distance away from Watteau, we were picked up
by waiting motor lorries and continued our


journey as far as Wallon-Capelle. Here the
order of things was just merely standing to,
ready to move off at a moment’s notice.
Two days were put in thus, and on the 26th
the whole of the Ambulance was drawn up on
parade and addressed by the O.C. He asked
any men who did not think they would be equal
to the strenuous days that they were assuredly
soon to face, to fall out in front. Not a man
stirred. Volunteers they were when they signed
on for the game out in Aussie, and they were still
volunteers to a man when more hard work of the
dinkum kind had to be faced.
He told them, amongst other things, that they
were going to a section of the front where the
fighting would be of an altogether different
nature to any the Australian troops had ex-
perienced before, so the boys knew what to ex-
pect when they got down South.
Moving off, the Unit marched to Steenbecque,
and entrained there for the southward journey.
Arriving at Doullens, we detrained and marched
through the town' to a field on the side of the
main road to await the arrival of motor lorries
to convey us further on.
The march through the town of Doullens
opened our eyes somewhat. Things were de-
cidedly mixed, and reminded us more of a jum-
ble oddment sale or a free counter lunch than a
smooth-going phase of war. The only calm
thing there was the weather. There wasn't
enough wind blowing on the Aussies, anyhow, to
ruffle an emu’s feather.
Our wait for the expected lorries was in vain,
for they failed to materialise. It was getting
late, and abandoning hope, we at last set out per
boot, and journeying via Terramesnil and Beau-
quesnes, ultimately reached Puchvillers, where
we camped for the night under our tents, pitched
in an old orchard. On the way we halted in the
street of Beauquesnes for a spell, and some of us
were fortunate enough to be supplied with a
drink of hot coffee by a fair inhabitant. In the
giving she paid the men with the “old brown
hat” a pretty compliment. She said that inside
the house all things were packed up ready to
get out, but that she intended to re-arrange her
furniture now, since the men with the big hat had
arrived and were marching in the right direction.
Next day we continued on our way, and halted
for the night at Beheneourt. The next day saw
us on the move once more, and darkness found
us at Franvillers, where we opened up a small
temporary Field Hospital.
During the whole of the journey from Doullens
we had reason to call to mind the words our
O.C. uttered at Wallon-Capelle. Certainly the
condition of things we saw existing this far
behind the actual front savoured of a kind of
warfare hitherto quite unknown by Australian
troops in France.
It was hard to believe that we were moving
up to the front where the enemy was, so rumour
said, still merrily pushing on. There were, I
believe, more khaki clad figures, the majority
without equipment and army transport, moving
the other way than there were moving our way.
But there was a difference. They were moving
in straggling groups, whereas the troops moving
our way were marching in some sort of for-
mation, and the progress made by us was much
slower than the progress made by them.. You
see, Jerry was coming and we were going the
right way to meet him.
Again, to make matters worse, many of the
civilian population in these parts had the “wind
up ’ ’ and were getting out as quickly as possible.
Of course, this could be expected of them, for
they were not trained soldiers. The roads were
rendered almost impassable by crowds of vehicles
of every description. From four wheeled farm
waggons to wheelbarrows, every species of
wheeled transport were represented. Every-
thing was heaped high with furniture, bedding
and kitchenware, and while father drove the
animal between the shafts, the family formed the
procession behind.
From Franvillers “B” tent sub. established
a record. They proceeded to Heilly, took over an
A.D.S., held it for ten minutes, and then, under
orders, handed it over again and rejoined the
Unit. Orders had been issued for an immediate
move, and “travel light’' was to be the order of
the going. Packs were dumped and we prepared


to get a move on carrying practically little else
besides an overcoat and our shaving gear. The
Ninth Brigade of Infantry, our brigade, had
been moved up in motor lorries and thrown out in
front of Villers-Brettoneux on a divisional front
to stop the Hun, and the job of getting up in
time to handle their wounded when the clash
came, lay with us.
It called for a long forced night march through
difficult going, and the way the Unit did it and
got up in time to handle the wounded Aussies,
gave rise to quite a shower of bouquets from
Brass Hats of high degree, that reached us per
medium of special routine orders afterwards.
At ten o’clock that night, after the necessity
of observing strict discipline on the march, to be
carried out in silence and without smoking, had
been pointed out, we set out on what was, per-
haps, the best remembered stunt that ever we
took part in. Passing through Bonnay, we at
length hit the town of Corbie, where we halted
near its towered church for a brief rest. Re-
suming once more, we struck Feuilloy and Cachy
and pulled up at Gentelles at 3 a.m.
On arrival there the men were warned to be
prepared to move off at a moments’ notice, and
were dismissed to do the best they could till day-
light, Daylight enabled us to see many things.
Amongst others there was a manned line of
trenches just across the village street, and later
on a splendid view of the British Cavalry going
into action.
Here the bearers were arranged in their squads
of four, and with the exception of a few squads
from “A” and “C” Sections, were told off for
duties out in front of the village with the horse
Ambulances as their means of evacuation for the
wounded. It certainly was spectacular warfare.
The guns, unlimbered in the open, without any
covering or protection, were barking away, and
we knew that on the farthest slope of the second
rise lay the guns that at times replied.
Chapter XIII.
At seven o’clock the following morning all
“C” Section bearers, under Captain McLean,
set out for Cachy and opened up an A.D.S. in
that village. Meanwhile a temporary head-
quarters was established in the village of
Gentelles.
The remainder of the men, under Major Smeal,
marched out at about 10 o’clock and proceeded
to the town of Boves, where it was decided to
open up a M.D.S., and billets were found for the
men in barns and lofts in the deserted town.
The horse transport, less the horse ambulances
and G.S. Waggons, which were attached to Head-
Quarters at Gentelles, were camped near some
haystacks at the side of the road near Boves
Station. That afternoon severe enemy shelling
made them abandon their position, and they
moved without suffering any casualties, to a
spot on the river bank just outside the town.
On the arrival of the main party at Boves, four
men and a N.C.O. were detailed to prepare and
hold the school house in the town for possible
use as a dressing station. They had not properly
started on their job when the first of our woun-
ded started to dribble through. The number of
patients—British, French, and Australian—
passing through, steadily increased, and the
station was a fairly busy one during the whoie
period of our stay there. Meanwhile the rest of
the Unit were in their quarters awaiting emerg-
encies.
At the Cachy A.D.S. numerous cases received
first aid and were evacuated to the M.D.S. at
Boves. At intervals the village was heavily
strafed, for the enemy, though he had absolutely
no observation, knew that the villages back of our
line must be holding troops, and strove to do as
much damage as he could to them.
Bearers were detailed from the A.D.S. at
Cachy for attachment to the Battalion R.A.P.’s,
and two squads of “C” Section men went for-
ward to the 35th Battalion R.A.P., whieh was
situated in a chateau in the town of Villers-
Brettoneux, right near the station.
The town those days had not long been aban-
doned by its civilian population, and was com-
paratively untouched. The residents had moved
out in a hurry and had left practically every-
thing as it stood.

statiu.n, i«.a.i*~ ro.M-i x, Ariui., iois.


The warehouses were stocked, the shops were
likewise, and the cellars and estaminets were not
by any means stripped of liquors and cham-
pagnes. Bicycles were amongst the things aban-
doned by the population, and they soon fell into
a place in the scale of barter and exchange. For
instance, a digger with a hoarded supply of
old champagne would swap a couple of bottles of
it away to another digger for a souvenired
bicycle, would ride it perhaps for a couple of
days, and in turn would exchange it for a loaf of
bread.
Travelling light, as the men were, in their rush
forward, a change of clothes had in very many
cases not been carried, and the presence of para-
sitic insects made a bath and clean change im-
perative. There was a marked lack of men’s
underwear, but soldiers, especially Aussie
soldiers, are not particular, and a women’s de-
serted laundry soon supplied the existing need;
and it was quite usual to strike diggers wearing
for underwear the bebe-ribbon-bedecked undies
of the gentler sex. We often struck wounded
passing through, so clad, and as we couldn’t alter
things, on they had to go, unchanged, to cause
remarks from the Sisters at the hospitals further
back.
In the matter of something to drink it was
funny how fastidious our soldiers grew those
days. Unless the wine was shown to be of old
vintage by its label, it was no good to them.
With viands it was just the same. As a diet
Maconochie had to rank as an “also ran” when
competing with tame rabbit and poultry. Yes,
things were decidedly good for the inner man in
those first days of Australian occupation. How-
ever, later an army order came out and men were
detailed to smash all bottles containing wine or
liquor. Those who were in the town that day
saw something that had never been seen in the
town before and it is to be hoped will never be
seen again—the gutters running red with wine!
On April Ist, “ B ” Section Bearers, proceeding
to Cachy via Gentelles with Captain McColl in
charge, relieved “C” Section there and at the
R.A.P. at Villers-Bretonneux. That afternoon
a heavy enemy barrage was dropped on the vil-
lage and there were a number of casualties from
the 34th Battalion. These were collected and
dressed at the post and extra Ambulance Cars
having arrived from Head-quarters in response
to a request sent down by mounted messenger,
they were evacuated back to the dressing station
at Boves, which at this time was evacuating its
cases to Namps.
The heavy shelling continuing, all bearers, with
the exception of two squads and Capt. McColl,
fell back some distance from this forward post.
During these times the battalions of the 9th
Brigade were located in the woods surrounding
Cachy and Gentelles, and in Villers-Bretonneux
itself.
On the following day “A ” Section, under the
command of Capt. Davies, relieved “B” Section,
and they reported back to the M.D.S. at Boves.
That afternoon the enemy again got busy and
the personnel were forced to take refuge in the
fields and in the surrounding shell holes.
The-next morning, when a shell came through
the building and half demolished the dressing
room, the personnel hastily retired. They re-
turned later, however, and salvaged the gear and
other things. These they formed into a dump
at the Amiens end of the village. No sooner
than this was done, however, than Jerry altered
his range and the shells fell thick and heavy in
the immediate neighbourhood.
Once more the lads fell back, but during a lull
succeeded in rescuing the only bottle of cham-
pagne that remained whole, and as they drank
it at a safe distance of a couple of hundred yards,
they calmly watched their dumped stretchers,
blankets, etc., being badly tom about by flying
shell fragments.
When the shell fire died down, they rescued
what was left and fell back to Head-quarters,
which was now situated in Bois L’Abbe.
Now to explain the presence of Head-quarters
in the wood. During the first night after its
establishment in Gentelles, intermittent enemy
shelling took place, and a few shells fell rather
close to their position. Next morning the shell-
ing increased in volume and four of the men
were wounded and one of the horses was killed.


Easing down for dinner, it again commenced at
3 p.m., and as it was heavy and fairly accurate,
it was decided to evacuate the position. Accord-
ingly everything was loaded on the available
transport and the party moved off to open up
another Head-quarters in the wood. Here they
stayed one night only, and having been joined
by Captain Davies and his party, moved to a
position on the Amiens-Villers-Bretonneux Road
and opened up there an A.D.S. It was rather
an interesting procession as it moved from the
wood. The men had their gear and equipment
packed on every kind of small man-powered
vehicle that the Somme area could produce, from
dog-carts to perambulators, and at the head
walked the O.C. and his Adjutant, Major Smyth,
accompanied by the regimental goat, an aban-
doned straggler that had attached itself for
rations and could not be driven off.
The new A.D.S. was under canvas and there
was a constant stream of wounded coming
through. Early in the morning of the 4th there
was heavy enemy shelling, but no direct damage
was caused. An enemy plane, flying low, came
over after dinner and shortly afterwards the
shelling recommenced with increased violence,
and once again our lads got a move on.
The patients had been gathering and collecting
as there were no ambulances available for their
evacuation. The labour of removing these
patients in safety to the newly selected A.D.S.
site in the trenches on the road side some 500
yards away was heavy and arduous.
Meanwhile the enemy had attacked under
cover of his heavy shelling, and things reached a
decidely interesting stage amongst our men at
this post. The only G.S. Waggon was loaded,
and everything was prepared in readiness for
coming events.
Word had come that the Boche had broken
through and was in the town. If this was so,
things looked pretty dickie for our fellows, for
they had far too many wounded on their hands,
and all that was left for them to do was to stand
by prepared and hope for the best. If Jerry
stip. came on it would be mafeesh for them and
they would be henceforth written up as prisoners
in German hands. Their only chance was that
he might be beaten off and, thanks to those tired-
out and weary, yet unbeatable diggers out in
front, he was not only beaten off, but sent back
past his own lines on the run.
The enemy had delivered a massed attack on
the town and succeeded in penetrating its out-
skirts. The infantry of the 9th Brigade put up
a magnificent fight, and after a tough struggle
succeeded in beating back the enemy, who were
their superiors in numbers to a very marked ex-
tent. During this dust-up the R.A.P. doing the
work for the 33rd Battalion had to be abandoned,
and the R.M.O. with his attendant bearers fell
back to the 35th R.A.P., so that the one post was
doing duty for the two battalions.
The motor and horse ambulances were doing
fine work while these stunts were on, but the
former were forced by the nature of the ground
to keep to the roads and could not get right up
to the forward dressing station. This meant
that the bearers had to form the connecting link
between the station and the waiting conveyances.
They carried their patients on wheeled stretchers
through this area, which was swept at frequent
intervals by enemy shell fire.
This massed attack by Fritz very nearly
achieved its object—the capture of the town.
At one period of the game the struggle got
mighty close to the R.A.P., and the R.M.O. dis-
patched messengers to battalion head-quarters
for instructions. This just happened at the turn-
ing point of the fight and the message was given
them to carry on. Shortly afterwards further
word came that the day was won and Jerry was
on the run.
A sigh of relief was heaved, for there were a
fair number of seriously wounded waiting treat-
ment, too many to get away before the arrival
of the enemy, and it would not have been a nice
sensation to find oneself moving towards the
Rhine as a prisoner.
After his defeat at the hands of our infantry
the enemy increased the strength of his Artillery
fire, and as the attendant casualties were heavy,
it became necessary to reinforce the bearers at
all posts. Another attack was expected that
night, but it did not eventuate.


Meanwhile the town of Boves had not been
allowed to escape enemy attention. Shells were
coming over, especially in the early morning, and
it was decided to evacuate the position in the
town. The Ambulance accordingly removed to
a spot on the side of the Villers-Bretonneux-
Amiens Road.
Here, at the edge of a wood, tents and operat-
ing tents were erected and the business of caring
for and evacuating the sick and wounded was
continued.
Chapter XIV.
At this position, the Canvas City, as it was
named by the boys, Head-quarters was estab-
lished, and it was there that all our bearers, ex-
cept one squad left at each post, reported for a
spell the next day.
The first days here were passed in the usual
camp fatigues to which were added the work of
revetting the hospital marquees and sleeping bil-
lets. This was a very necessary precaution, for
bombing hostile aircraft were nightly visitors
while on the way to Amiens, and we knew from
past experience that the red cross met with but
scant respect at his hands. Later events showed
that he did respect the red cross on this oc-
casion. Though the road and surrounding woods
were frequently shelled, we were not molested.
A map, captured later at Peronne, showed our
hospital site.
The bearers at the forward posts were re-
lieved every 48 hours, each section taking it in
turn to supply reliefs.
About this time it was decided to open up a
new A.D.S., and on the evening of the 10th a
party consisting of “B” tent sub., horse trans-
port, and some bearers from all sections, under
the command of Major Smyth, moved out to a
spot on the side of the Noyon Road. On arrival
there the tents were erected and preparations
made to start operations. The bearers were sent
forward. When morning broke, orders recalling
the party were received, and the men struck
camp and returned to the Canvas City once
more.
While all spare men were busy about the camp,
the tent sub-division men (“C” Section), in the
marquees were kept busy handling a constant
stream of wounded and gassed patients; for at
this time the enemy was sending over a great
many gas shells and was finding occasional vic-
tims. Until the 17th this state of affairs con-
tinued, but on that night things intensified, and
the town of Villers-Bretonneux was absolutely
flooded with gas.
The air seemed full of whining gas shell, and
on every hand could be heard the muffled ex-
plosion of the bursting projectiles. The fumes
were everywhere, and penetrating even the cel-
lars and dug-outs, claimed many victims. The
33rd Battalion, billeted in the centre of the gas
storm, suffered very heavily, and motor and
horsed ambulances and every other available kind
of vehicle had to work at top speed to get the
stricken ones away.
Back at the Canvas City Dressing Station,
though the roadside was lined with stretcher
cases four deep, things were working smoothly.
The delay there was only a short one, and on the
sufferers went to the C.C.S., where there were
appliances and means of further easing their
agonies.
Two days after this, preparations were made
for a move. This was necessary, for the bat-
talions of the Brigade had become sadly weak-
ened and their ranks grievously depleted by the
strenuous times they had been through since
they had set out to stop the Hun in his vic-
torious march on Amiens nearly three weeks
before. So well had they succeeded that they
had earned the name and title bestowed on them
by the French of “Saviours of Amiens.”
While we had been carrying on in this for-
ward area, we had been lucky, for only two of
our men, Jack Cox and Harold McLean, had
been called upon to make the supreme sacrifice.
Good men and true, always fearlessly carrying
on their dangerous work, not knowing when and
where might come the end.
April the 20th saw the Unit march to
Querrien, where they were allotted billets in
houses and outbuildings, and a dressing room


was opened up for the handling of sick parades.
After two days of Querrieu, “B” tent sub-
division and horse transport, under the com-
mand of Major Smyth, were attached to Corps
and, proceeding to a point on the Main Road
just outside the village of Flescelles, opened up
there, No. 1 Corps Walking Wounded Relay
Post.
The Camp was under canvas, the sectional
tentage being used for the accommodation of the
personnel, and hospital marquees that had been
salvaged were prepared for the expected
patients.
This post was established so far back because
there was still a possibility of the Boche suc-
ceeding in breaking through, and it was as well
to be prepared in the event of this happening.
The future proved that these possibilities did
not eventuate, but it was not a bad front to
hold, this Flescelles front, and the boys there
did not mind.
Meanwhile, the Unit proper put in a week at
Querrieu and then moved to Petit Camon, a
small village on the Amiens-Albert Road, where
they occupied the place vacated by the 13th
Australian Field Ambulance. Billets were
found for the men in the farm houses near at
hand, and a hospital for the Brigade was started.
Cars every day travelled round the battalions
and collected their sick, bringing them to our
hospital for treatment. Those whose recovery
would be a matter of only a few days were held,
but the more serious cases were evacuated to
the hospitals further back. All slightly gassed
cases were also treated at this post.
A party of eight bearers were detailed to
assist the 11th Field Ambulance who were con-
ducting a M.D.S. in Querrieu.
At Petit Camon the boys spent their time in
keeping the Camp and Hospital up to the mark,
using up all their spare time in preparing for
the approaching Unit Sports. These were held
on the 9th May and a full programme of well
contested events was the result.
The A.D.M.S., Colonel Maguire, and his
Adjutant, were among the interested spectators.
Two days afterwards the Unit moved nearer
to Amiens, and while the tent sub-divisions of
“A” and “C” Sections took over a hospital in
the School at Rivery, which had been conduct-
ed by the 7th Field Ambulance, the bearers
found a complete site under canvas near a wood
on the Poulainville Road, about one and a half
miles distant. From here squads of men were
detailed each day for duty in and around the
hospital.
The days that followed were spent in outdoor
games and in swimming.
The River Somme was not far away, and the
boys availed themselves of the opportunities it
afforded for bathing to the fullest extent. On
the 19th of the month the 9th Brigade Swim-
ming Carnival was held in the Amiens Baths,
and most of the principal events came our way.
The Carnival was a two-days’ affair, and on the
second day the Relay Race, the chief event, was
won by the Unit team.
On the 22nd the Unit got a further move on,
and while “C” Section tent sub-division took
over the reserve M.D.S. on the Corbie Road,
Ilead-quarters moved to a position on the river
bank outside Camon, where “A” tent sub-
division opened up a collecting post for wounded
and the bearers carried on the usual routine of
work, erecting tents, revetting them when
erected, and building dug-outs.
Two bearer squads were detailed to a walking
wounded post on the opposite bank of the river
and worked in 48-hour shifts. “B” Section
Bearers moved out to the M.D.S. situated on the
main Amiens Road near Glissy, to work in con-
junction with the bearers of the 11th Ambulance
in the forward area.
The forward posts on this Sector were the
usual number of R.A.P.’s and loading posts on
the left of the town of Villers-Bretonneux, from
whence the patients were removed to the A.D.S.,
which was situated in what was known as The
Tunnel, close to the town.
Enemy shelling was constantly carried on,
and at one stage of the game No. 2 Relay Post
had to be abandoned by our bearers, who opened
up another post in a safer place near by. At
this time gas seemed to be the enemy’s chief

means of attack, and the air was never quite
clear of its deadly fumes. All our men, with
very few exceptions, were suffering in more or
less serious degree from its effects. This neces-
sitated their relief, and bearers from “A” Sec-
tion took their place. Meanwhile “C” Section
Bearers were on duty at the Tunnel A.D.S., and
assisted in the digging out of a chalk pit for
use as a dressing room.
This was a pretty hard job, as it meant that
all the chalk when dug out had to be carried
outside in bags and dumped.
This Tunnel was a mighty hot place, speaking
in the parlance of warfare. It was evidently a
position well marked by the enemy, for he shelled
it with H.E. and gas day and night, and numer-
ous casualties were sustained.
Towards the end of the month “A” Section
Bearers were relieved for four days, and when
that time was up, returned once again to the
line.
Chapter XV.
The month of June was passed much as usual,
the only break being the visit of General Howse,
V.C., the A.D.M.S., and others on a tour of in-
spection.
On the 28th, preparations were set on foot for
a move, and the next day all the bearers and
“A” tent sub-division were recalled to Head-
quarters at the reserve M.D.S. The Unit, when
complete, moved out to again take over the hos-
pital in the School House at Rivery, this time
from the sth Field Ambulance.
The bearers found a resting place at their old
quarters near the wood on the Poulainville Road,
and the days were spent in the ordinary fatigues
and out door sports such as cricket and football.
A muster parade of the Unit, and an inspec-
tion and speech by Lieut.-Colonel Jolley, took
place on the last day o fthe month.
The month of July started, as had started, so
the bearers say, a good many other months of the
Ambulance’s life, by the detailing of parties of
bearers to proceed to Rivery to clean and polish
up the transport waggons and harness. On this
D
occasion the work must have been faithfully
carried out under the personal supervision of the
0.C., who had his tunic off and worked with the
rest, for the Unit secured first prize in the brig-
ade transport competition which was held shortly
afterwards.
The next few days, with the exception of the
dispatch of our motor ambulances to assist in
the evacuation of patients from the 12th Field
Ambulance, passed without strange happenings.
On the 10th the O.C. and some of the officers
went forward to inspect the forward area, and
we knew we were in for it once again.
The next few days were occupied in packing
up, loading waggons, etc., and clearing up the
precincts of the camp.
On the 12th the Ambulance moved forward in
two bodies. The first to leave were the bearers
and men going to take over the forward posts.
This party, about one hundred and twenty
strong, marched out under Major Fitzpatrick.
They were accompanied by three horsed ambu-
lances and a water cart.
The remainder of the personnel, in charge of
Captain Lever, got a move on later, and pro-
ceeding to a spot on the Corbie Hoad, just out-
side Daours, took over the A.D.S. there and
established Head-quarters. All cases coming
from the line passed through this post and were
evacuated thence to the M.D.S. in Amiens.
The forward party halted at Yecquemont,
near Daours, for dinner. “C” Section men,
under the command of Captain Samson, and fol-
lowed by a horsed ambulance, moved off from
here to take over a forward position known as
Smith’s Farm. The remainder, continuing their
march via Aubigny, reached their destination,
Aubigny Post, only to find that the cooks, who
had been sent forward to prepare a hot meal,
had in error, not stopped here, but had gone
further forward to Hayes Post.
An advanced Head-quarters was established
at Aubigny Post, and the remainder of the men,
under Captain Binns, went forward to Hayes
Post. From here, after a hot meal, squads of
bearers were sent out to relieve the men of the
13th Field Ambulance. All reliefs were possible


in daylight, as the enemy’s direct ground ob-
servation was not good anywhere along this
part of the line except at one point near Support
R.A.P. on the Right.
A glance at the accompanying diagram will
show the relative positions of the posts taken
over by the Ambulance during these operations.
At the first, “A” Section manned the right por-
tion of the Sector, “B” Section were in the
middle, and “C” Section on the left. As the
work was extremely heavy and conditions of
life were not of the best, arrangements were
made to send each section of bearers back to
Daours for a few days at intervals, and on return
they took over a different part of the front to the
one they had occupied before, their rest.
It was desirable that all the men should
know the whole front intimately in view of ap-
proaching big events.
While out at rest, a party of bearers under
their own N.C.O.’s, from the 10th and 11th
Ambulances, acted in their stead.
The posts occupied forward were mostly dug-
outs, more or less completed, and perhaps a brief
description of them would not be out of place.
Le Sec. R.A.P. was situated in a gully just off
the main road, and was a fairly good dug-out,
capable of accommodating about twenty cases.
Support R.A.P., as signified by the name, was
an old trench dug-out in the support line of
trenches. There was no room for any cases, and
as there were no approaches, it was altogether
unsuitable and was not much used. Its close
proximity to the front line, and the fact that, in
order to get their patients to it, the Regimental
Stretcher Bearers had to carry about 300 yards
over open country on the top of a ridge in full
view of the enemy, made the job of getting the
cases to it an exceedingly dangerous one.
The R.A.P. for the reserve trenches, capable
of holding about 40 men, was at Yaire. Further
on the left of the front there were two more
R.A.P.’s (one named Ravine) run by the sth
Australian Division, which were cleared by our
boys.
• The Motor Loading Post at Vaire was situated
in gas proofed cellars. The spot was not a bad
one, and a Ford car was always in position-here
for removal of patients to Smith’s Farm.
Smith’s Farm A.D.S. consisted of two deep dug-
outs cut well into the side -of the hill and capable
of holding 40 to 50 cases each. From here cases
were evacuated by Talbot car to the post at
Daours through La Neuville.
On the roadside outside Neuville a Talbot car
was always stationed to act as a switch' car.
When the car from Smith’s Farm had taken a
load of patients through, this car replaced it,
and the car returning from Daours pulled : in in
its ■ place.
On the Right Sector the R.A.P.’s and relays
were small dug-outs. That known as the Road
R.A.P. was an abandoned Bosehe dug-out in his
old front line trench, and capable of holding
the M.O. and his staff only. The main post,
Hayes Post (which- was sometimes referred to
by the boys as “Whackie’s Post”—for it had
been named after Sergeant Hayes of the 9th)
was in one entrance to an unfinished deep dug-
out in the side of a quarry. The other entrance
was occupied by some Brigade runners.
Meanwhile the personnel of the ambulance
were settling down in their position and carrying
out much needed improvements. At Aubigny
Post excavation work was set in progress for
various ear positions: and a dressing room for
wounded. This was afterwards covered in with
a good solid roof. An eye had to be kept on the
roads of eveeuation to and from the front areas,
and it was frequently found necessary to send
men with limber loads of material to effect
necessary repairs.
At Daours, with an eye to possible happenings
during future operations, when it might become
necessary to open the place as a big Main
Dressing Station, or even as a C.G.S., extensive
works were set in progress. Bearer squads were
attached to us from the. 10th and 11th Ambu-
lances as well as a party of carpenters from the
Pioneers.
Huge cavaties were sunk in the ground, and
in these wooden huts were erected.
Deeply dug alley ways and passages were
formed connecting the different buildings.

When the job was completed, Jerry would
have to get a bomb right on top of a hut to do
any damage. Roads were formed and metalled,
and every preparation was made for expedit-
iously handling patients up to any number.
The horse transport lines were revetted to a
height of four feet, and an up-to-date, huge,
two-chambered incinerator was erected to cope
with the camp refuse.
In addition, the legitimate work of the place,
the care of the sick and wounded, was being
steadily gone on with. A fair number of gassed
cases were arriving, and these were always
sponged with sodi-bicarb. solution and changed
into pyjamas before being sent on to the M.D.S.
in Amiens.
The Switch plan was followed out with the
motor ambulances here. When one came down
from the line loaded, it was sent on to the
M.D.S. and an empty one from those standing
by was dispatched to take its place in the for-
ward zone.
By this means the forward posts were never
long without a car, and it was with the utmost
despatch that the wounded were got out of the
line.
During the time that the Ambulance was at-
tending to this front, there were not many big
things doing, a few minor raids were the only
happenings. Please don’t run away with the
idea that because this was so the bearers were
having “cushy” jobs. They certainly were not,
for the carries that they had to do were, almost
without exception, highly dangerous ones, and
the stages were long and hard. In between
times, when well-earned rest should have been
theirs, they were called upon to work hard
making their dug-outs better, arranging more ac-
commodation for the wounded, and doing the
many jobs that the necessities of the time and
local conditions called for.
Many of the posts they had to occupy were
evidently marked ones, well-known to Jerry, for
when he shelled—and he did so pretty frequently
—his aim was excellent, and it certainly was not
his fault that his score wasn’t greater than it
was. Especially was this shelling noticeable at
Hayes’s Post. He kept at it continuously, but
never got it. His score there was the top of a
motor ambulance and a badly bent cook house.
Chapter XVI.
On the 24th of the month, stretcher bearers
of the 33rd American Division were attached to
the Unit to learn at first hand by association
with our chaps, just how the forward area work
was conducted. They were always ready and
willing and, during the time they were with us,
were never found wanting; but proved to be
such good pupils, workers and mates, that when
the time came for their recall to their own lines,
we were indeed loth to see them go.
They were split up amongst our bearers and
were given the opportunity of learning the game
from start to finish.
On the night of the 25th the enemy made a
raid on the part of the line held by the 33rd
Battalion. From our point of view the affair
was highly successful, for our casualties were
very slight and there were not many of the Ger-
mans able to return to their own lines.
On the 30th a chance shell secured a hit, and
Knight had given his all in the cause. He had
been wounded at Ypres, and this was his first
time in the line since rejoining the Unit. Never
a shirker, always a fine worker, always willing
to assist his mates —our loss was a great one.
On the last day of the month English troops
relieved the 9th Brigade on the Left Sector, and
our men were relieved at Smith’s Farm and its
feeding R.A.P.’s by a British Field Ambulance.
On being relieved they reported back to Daours.
Things went on uneventfully for some few
days, and on the sth of August a party of “B”
tent sub-division took over an estaminet in the
town of Aubigny and established there an A.D.S.
Rumours had been flying round that things of
import were going to happen, and it was as well
to be prepared.
That night the enemy amused himself by
flinging his ironmongery around and into the
town, and as the roads were crowded with trans-
port carrying ammunition, etc., up to the line,
the casualties were fairly heavy.


ENTRANCE TU DUO-OUT, HAYES' POST.


util FIELD AMBULANCE —WALKING WOUNDED SIGN. STILL AT HAMEL.


The newly opened post was soon doing a brisk
business and passing transport of any kind was
commandeered for the conveyance of the
wounded back to the main A.D.S. This custom
was one that was generally followed when the
stream of wounded was a big one and our own
motor ambulances were fully occupied. The
necessity of getting the wounded men back an-
other stage in the long line of evacuation was an
urgent one, and our fellows had the cheek to
stop any passing conveyance that would serve
their turn. I can call to mind, one morning at
the A.D.S., seeing a Staff car stopped and two
Fritz wounded prisoners, all that was left to
make a total clearance of the post, placed in the
back seat. They looked all smiles, and, in fact,
far happier than the British Staff Officer occupy-
ing the seat in front.
Definite word from the A.D.M.S. replaced the
rumours of the coming stunt, and preparations
were made to cope with any possibilities.
The order of the attack for the 3rd Division
was to be as follows:
The 9th and 11th Brigades on the right and
left were the attacking brigades, the 10th Brig-
ade meanwhile holding the line.
The 9th and 11th Brigades were to move for-
ward at Zero, and at Zero plus four, were to
reach their first objective, the green line. Here
the 4th Division was to go through them and
establish themselves on the blue line, sending out
patrols as far as the red line.
The work of the 9th Ambulance was to clear
R.A.P.’s of the 3rd Division, establish posts on
the green line, and at four hours after Zero, to
clear casualties from 4th Divisional Ambulances.
Captain Samson was placed in charge of evacua-
tions from the 9th Brigade, while those from the
10th and 11th Brigades were under the care of
Majors Fitzpatrick and Smyth respectively.
They evacuated all cases from the R.A.P.’s to
the collecting posts, and Major Bond had charge
of all evacuations thence to the dressing stations
further back. The S.M.O. of each of the in-
fantry brigades had attached to them, besides
cooks, clerk, dispatch riders, etc., a section of
bearers as well as horsed and motor ambulances.
Two dumps of 100 stretchers, 200 blankets,
and a quantity of splints, dressings, etc., were
made; one at Vaire and one at Hayes’ Post. Ten
stretchers were handed over to the medical officer
attached to each battalion, and 60 additional ones
were given to the tanks for distribution in the
forward area over the blue line.
The bearer squads joined up with their res-
pective Battalion M.O. ’s, carrying one stretcher
to every two men. In two cases, however, the
M.O. ’s preferred to go into action with their
details only, and their allotment of bearers pro-
ceeded to rendezvous and joined their battalions
as they got into position.
The whole arrangements for the handling of
the wounded were excellent and spoke well for
the organising abilities of the man at the head.
No eventualities were overlooked. Preparations
were made whereby in the event of the attack
being successful, two G.S. waggons were to move
fo'rward at 8.30 to the green line and form
dumps at two selected spots, of stores, equipment,
etc., for use by the 4th Division when they went
through the. 3rd Division towards the second
line of objectives.
How the attack went is history now, and the
world knows that the lads from down under just
simply would not be denied, but crushing all
resistance before them, delivered to the enemy an
overwhelming blow which was to be for him, as
after events proved, the beginning of the end.
Of casualties, as could only be expected, there
were some, but not many. What casualties there
were, were mainly carried back by prisoners
under the supervision of our bearers. The
prisoners were only too glad to give their ser-
vices, as it was ever so much healthier for them
to be on the side of the advancing line of fighting
infantry than in front of it.
Zero hour was 4.20 a.m., and at this hour the
A.D.S. at Aubigny closed down, and all cases
passed back to Fouilloy, those from the left of
our front being collected at a collecting post
which had been opened up by Major Smyth and
his men in Hamel. This post was used till about
half past seven, when it was moved forward to


Cerisy on the green line, and shortly afterwards
the A.C.P. for the right sector opened up near
it, but at a point further south on the same line.
When the move was made forward to the
Cerisy post, a 4th Divisional Ambulance, after
being shelled out of the position they had first
chosen, opened up an M.D.S. on the site of our
original A.C.P.
Everything was going like clock-work on our
immediate front, but there was a hold-up on the
other side of the river and the enemy’s massed
artillery was enfilading our fellows on this side
of the stream. The A.M.C. personnel from the
Cerisy post fell back and took up a position at
the cross roads from Gailly and Cerisy. Whilst
here, some of the boys “ souveneered ” a German
horse ambulance waggon with its team of two
German horses. The turnout was taken charge of
by the previously mentioned ‘ ‘ Whacker ’ ’ Hayes,
who, having christened the horses “Fritzy” and
“Fraulein” and invented a language that they
understood (mostly forcible gestures), made
much use of it, keeping the tucker up to the men
further forward, and shifting gear and equip-
ment when there was a move on. This capture
did good service till it was sent on to base about
three weeks later.
The stay at the cross roads was only a matter
of twenty-four hours, for a composite division of
Australians and Yanks crossed the river to the
left, and launching a strong attack, soon cleared
up Mallard Wood, Bois de Celestine, and the
town of Chipilly, and by capturing Jerry’s guns
finished his enfilading fire.
Then our fellows moved forward again, and
passing their old position at Cerisy, formed an
A.C.P. at Morcourt, which they occupied till
they were relieved 48 hours afterwards. From
here, once again, the switch system was ar-
ranged for the evacuating ambulance cars, five
Talbots being placed at intervals along the back
track, and everything worked splendidly and
without a single hitch.
While here a good opportunity was afforded
the men under Major Smyth’s command to view
a military joke that our infantry boys put over
on Frit£
At this place there was an U shaped bend in
the river, which was, of course, occupied by the
enemy.
The battalion at the neck end of the bend,
instead of advancing straight ahead, merely did
a huge left form and waited. The German artil-
lery, thinking that they would surely move for-
ward from this position, strafed the country
shut in by the river bend unmercifully, and
when things eased up, all our fellows had to do
was to advance and mop up the few Germans
who remained alive. The German dead lay thick
on every side, telling how severe the shelling
must have been. The capture of the position
by the success of the Aussie’s head work, though
it was a grim joke for Fritz, opened up the road
and made the advance on Bray a lot easier.
During the earlier hours of the first hop over,
so well did the arrangements for the evacuation
of the wounded work, that four hours after
zero the whole of the 9th, 10th, and 11th Brig-
ades had been cleared.
Chapter XVII
The ninth of August was a quiet one, and
while Jerry nursed his wounds, our boys rested
to get their second wind. Meanwhile, how were
our posts further south keeping pace with the
advance? On the 10th, just as darkness was
coming on, word came through to open up an
A.D.S. near Warfusee, in La Motte-en-Santerre.
“B” and “C” Section tent men, under Major
Bond, moved forward from Aubigny, accom-
panied by all the transport then at Aubigny
Post. Arriving there in the dark, the work of
finding suitable positions was a matter of great
difficulty, especially as the enemy’s night flying
aeroplanes were exceedingly active, and bombs
seemed to be bursting everywhere.
Transport lines were placed in a gully, and
a temporary post for handling the wounded was
fixed near a deep Jerry dug-out. Here the work
was carried on throughout the night without a
light of any sort, for to show a light meant to
attract the attention of a bombing plane.
Next morning some cellars in the ruined vil-
lage were cleared out, and the A.D.S. was moved

to them. During the night there was some con-
fusion in the forward evacuations. At midnight
Major Bond was sent forward to arrange things.
He succeeded in adjusting things satisfactorily
and everything proceeded normally.
On the right sector all cases were carried from
the R.A.P.’s to the main Villers-Bretonneux
Road, and thence were carried by 2nd Divisional
Ambulance cars back to the A.D.S. We cannot
speak too highly of the valuable assistance ren-
dered by these ears. Their drivers were always
ready and obliging.
On the 11th the tents of the Ambulance were
sent forward along the main road, accompanied
by a party of bearers, and a site being selected
on the side of the road, were there erected for
use as a possible A.D.S. We were never destined
to open up there, however, for the next day
orders came through for a hurried move, and
a R.A.M.C. Ambulance took over our posts, and
once more we loaded waggons to get a move on.
The move was not one of the full Ambulance,
because the stopping of one of the 3rd Divisional
brigades in the line necessitated the stopping
with them of the usual party of bearers.
The Unit moved off in parties, and the men
spent the night as best they could at Two-Way
Relay. The next morning they got a move on,
and, followed shortly after by the transport
which moved out of Warfusee, after a decent
march, reached their old quarters at Daours.
Here the order of things was to be prepared to
move out at a moment’s notice, for Jerry had
been hard hit out there in front and we might
be needed at any moment, and this position at
Daours was, thanks to the recent advance, now
quite out of touch with the business centre of
the game.
In this state of readiness we stayed at Daours
for five days, and our time was taken up with
kit inspections and gas mask inspections as well
as general duties about the camp. Opportun-
ities were afforded the men to enjoy a swim or
two, and the swimming parades were always
popular.
Onjthe 18th the order arrived to be in readi-
ness to move at four hours’ notice, and on the
following day the Unit left Daours and pro-
ceeded to Smith’s Farm. Here they took over
the A.D.S., relieving the 13th Field Ambulance.
The station was re-arranged with a view of
changing it into a Main Dressing Station.
The bearers were warned to be in readiness
for line work very soon, and on the 21st, two
bearer subdivisions, under the command of
Captain Samson, reported to the 10th Ambulance
and were allotted to the different forward posts
and to the battalions. On this occasion the Ninth
Field Ambulance did not have charge of the line
operations.
On the next day the stunt took place, and the
bearers had a busy and extremely dangerous
time of it. They had long carries, almost the
whole of the way exposed to heavy enemy shell-
ing. All cases were taken to the A.D.S. which
had been opened up in Chipilly and were
evacuated thence by car to Smith’s Farm M.D.S.
As the battalions advanced, the bearers fol-
lowed them up, establishing collecting posts
where necessary, and keeping the area traversed
clear of wounded men.
From “A” Section Bearers, who had been at
Head-quarters at the M.D.S., sixteen were now
detailed to report to the C.O. of the 10th Ambu-
lance for duty forward, and took their place in
the line.
Meanwhile a game of leap frog was being
played with the dressing stations. What was an
A.D.S. to-day would be a M.D.S. to-morrow.
The rearmost station, at a set hour, would shut
down, and its staff, going in advance of where
the A.D.S. was, would open up a new A.D.S.,
and, taking in all wounded, would evacuate them
back to the original A.D.S., henceforth to
function as a M.D.S. This system worked
splendidly, and throughout the whole period of
operations—lasting as they did some considerable
time —not one hitch occurred.
The 25th witnessed one round in this game of
leap frog, for the “B” and “C” Section tent
men and what was left of “A ” Section Bearers,
closed down at Smith’s Farm, and opened up
another post in the cellars of a chateau at
Chipilly. The A.D.S. was now in Bray.


The infantry still continued their onward
march towards Suzanne, and were attended by
the bearers at all times. The stream of wounded
passing back, though not of great magnitude,
was a constant one, and the work of the bearers
was by no means easy.
With the morning of the 28th came the order
for another shuffle of the back stations, and an
A.D.S. was established in Suzanne in the build-
ings of a large chateau.
Here, as everywhere else, the brutish work of
the Hun was very evident, perhaps more than
usually so, for it was here that the vaults under
the church had been opened and the very dead,
who had lain undisturbed in their coffins for
many years, desecrated and despoiled by mon-
strous hands.
The bearers still carried on with the battalions
towards Clery and Curlu under conditions that
were good, as far as the actual going went, but
extremely dangerous on account of the con-
tinuous enemy shelling.
The Reserve Bearers were held at the loading
post which was situated at the Chalk Pits on
the Clery Road.
On the night of the 29th the Unit Head-
quarters moved forward and occupied the A.D.S.
at Suzanne, transforming it into an M.D.S. A
post for walking wounded was opened up in the
same village.
The Reserve Bearers, accompanied by Ford
cars, moved from the Chalk Pits, and following
up the battalions, established collecting posts
en route, to which centres the forward bearers
brought all wounded for evacuation by car to
the dressing stations.
On this date an A.D.S. was opened up at
Curlu, the victorious infantry still continuing
their march towards Peronne.
During these latter days of the advance the
bearers were kept extremely busy, and though
numbers were wounded, only four of our boys
paid the great price—Wilfred Boys, Fred
Woodham, Alban Clarkson, and Eli Rabinovitch,
—killed in the execution of their duty, while
attending to the wounded, met their end as men,
died as only men can die.
Chapter XVIII.
Every day the infantry made progress and
Jerry saw his strongholds and positions, one
after the other, fall into the hands of those in-
trepid Australians. No wonder he said that
there were fifteen divisions of those troops
against him, for they seemed to be always at him.
At the end of the month the ridge practically
commanding the famous Mount St. Quentin, con-
sidered by Fritz to be impregnable, was taken
by our boys and the Mount outflanked. A quick
rush in open order by merely a handful of men,
and Mount St. Quentin was in our hands. It
was a honeycomb of dug-outs and machine gun
emplacements, and its slopes and approaches
were laced and interlaced with wire. The cas-
ualties were extremely light and were altogether
out of keeping with the magnitude of the
achievement.
The enemy, by constant shelling of the roads
of communication, was doing his best to stop
the advance, but unavailingly. Any casualties
that occurred were got back by the aid of Ger-
man prisoners who were only too willing to do
the work; thus hoping to ingratiate themselves
with our fellows and get a feed on arrival at the
dressing station.
On the 4th the bearers were recalled from the
line and returned to their respective units. The
Main Dressing Station again underwent a
change, and became a Brigade Hospital, still
under the management of our Ambulance.
The spell of the bearers was not of long dura-
tion, for. arrangements were made whereby the
parties of bearers were in future to move with
the brigades to which they were attached.
Two days later a party of men under a N.C.O.
went forward to Halle and made preparations
there for the opening up of a M.D.S. They were
followed later by the three tent sub-divisions of
the Ambulance and Head-quarters was estab-
lished there.
On the 11th and 12th the bearers, who had
been mainly stationed at Curlu, rejoined the
Unit at Halle and the Ambulance was once
more complete. Here the next fortnight was
occupied in several ways.


Training in physical drill, tent pitching, etc.,
was started for the Ambulance —though it had
worried-through nearly two years of active ser-
vice—still was without the finishing touches of
its book education. Gas drill was again started,
on theoretical lines, of course, for the boys on
very many occosions had been through enemy
gas wearing their masks for hours at. a time, and
the practical part might be well said to have
been, thoroughly mastered. Again there was the
usual “form fours” business, and those other
little things that go to make a soldier. Our
aspirations did not aim at being soldiers,
machine soldiers, that is. We would much
rather be camouflaged civilians doing our job
till the end.
The equipment of the Ambulance was made
uniform by the issue of new—new to us—web
equipment.
There was, however, a lighter side to all these
carryings on. Impromptu dances were arranged
and held in portion of the large building, in part
of which a small hospital, which had taken the
place of the Main Dressing Station, was being
conducted.
A series of football matches were played, and
hard and well controlled games tended to keep
the boys fit for future work. The Pierrot
Troupe of the Ist Division started showing in a
barn near by, and there was always an invitation
for a party of the 9th to see the show. It was
a good show, too, and much interest was aroused
amongst all ranks of the Ambulance in the in-
dividual numbers of the party. The lady im-
personator was “just it,” but the remarks she
made the night one of our little night fliers
brought two of Jerry’s bombing planes down in
flames, certainly proved she was no lady. In
passing, mention might be made of the full
throated roar that went up that night when
Fritz started on his fall. Darkness everywhere
on the earth, but the volume of the roar easily
showed that there must have been thousands of
Aussie eyes watching the exploit.
The huge Gotha was making for his own lines
and 'jvas sharply defined in the beam of our
searchlight. Machine guns were rattling at him,
when suddenly a flare as a signal to stop firing
came from a spot not far behind him. Then one
of our little fliers shot into the searchlight’s
beam, and soon his tracer bullets were streaming
towards the flying enemy. The aim was good,
and soon the big machine burst into flame. Then
came the fireworks of many colours as the flames
reached his flares, and as the lot came to earth
the air was full of the burstings of his released
bombs. We certainly held the supremacy of the
air those days and nights also.
The 3rd Divisional Pierrot Troupe, “The
Coo-ees,” came along one night and gave'us a
show, and as its members had bumped us at
many points along the route of our war, all
hands had “some time” afterwards.
The Horse Transport on two occasions turned
out in full strength and did a couple of route
marches. Shortly afterwards came the time for
getting busy once more.
The Furphy Kings of the Unit had been busy
for some time, but though they differed some-
what as to dates, they were agreed that an at-
tempt was shortly to be made by the Aussies
and Yanks to break through the Hindenburg
Line. Once again they foretold truly, for on
the 28th September, “B” tent sub-division, with
some of the horse transport, and under the com-
mand of Major Smyth, moved forward to a point
on the light railway near Villers-Faucon, and
established a walking wounded Railway Loading
Post there in readiness for the coming line
events.
On the same day the bearers moved forward
to a post beyond Villers-Faucon, near St. Emilie,
and eventually moved farther on to dug-outs in
a sunken road. Here they stopped till they left
to join up with their respective battalions before
the zero hour on the . day of the stunt.
To make things more understandable, it might
be as well to lay down the plan which was to be
followed in the attack.
The Americans were to attack at about 5 a.m.
in the morning of the 29th, hopping off from
the brown line and having the green line as
their objective. The 3rd Australian Division
was here to pass through them and push on to




the red line and there consolidate their position.
The 10th Brigade on the left, the 11th on the
right, with the 9th in reserve would be the ar-
rangement of the Australians in the attack.
The sth Australian Division was to move
through the Americans on the right in the same
way. This method of attack meant that the left
flank of the 3rd Division would be exposed, and
it was very probable that the 9th Brigade would
be used to defend on that side.
The organisation for the evacuation of the
wounded was as follows: A major, two bearer
captains, quarter-master sergeant, cook with
necessary gear, two mounted orderlies, three
horsed ambulances, limber water cart, five horses
with pack saddles for use as water carriers, two
transport N.C.O.’s and all available cars to re-
port to the O.C. of forward evacuations before
zero hour.
Each Ambulance had to furnish this quota of
personnel and equipment, but each group was
to be allotted to its own Brigade.
Three squads of bearers, under a senior N.C.0.,
were attached to each battalion, and their job
was to keep in touch with the R.M.O.’s of the
battalions, and see that the line was kept clear of
wounded. For the purpose of carrying out this
order, each section of the Ambulance was drawn
from, and each squad of four carried with it
two stretchers, Thomas splints, 40 shell dress-
ings, a surgical haversack, and a plentiful sup-
ply of water. Meanwhile “C” Section, under
Major Bond, established an Advanced Dressing
Station in the town of St. Emilie, and the Head-
quarters of the Ambulance was also moved to
the same town.
Chapter XIX,
At 8 o’clock the battalions, bearers and re-
serve bearers moved forward through the town
of Lempire, and took up the reserve position in
front of that town. This position, before the
Americans launched their attack earlier in the
morning, had been “no man’s land,” and as its
appoach was over country under direct obser-
vation of the enemy, it was only to be expected
that there should be casualties amongst the men
when moving up. These, however, being at-
tended to were soon on the track to the rear.
At nine o’clock two nursing men were sent
forward by car from the Advanced Dressing
Station at St. Emilie to reconnoitre. Travelling
via Ronssoy and thence along the Bellecourt
Road, the 10th and 11th Brigades were struck,
dug in. On arriving near Benjamin Post the in-
formation was gleaned that the Bosche was in
possession of the valley just over the ridge.
Stretcher cases were met coming back, and one
of the nurses, after putting up a red cross flag,
stopped to attend to them while his comrade
went back to bring up more cars. The first
loads of cases from here were sent back and de-
posited in Ronssoy, which was not at that time
being shelled by the Bosche. Benjamin Post
was advantageously situated, being visible from
all points and handily placed to a decent road,
and it was decided to continue using it as a
collecting post. Not long afterwards three
horsed Ambulances reported here with blankets,
medical comforts and dressings. Having been
unloaded, the vehicles were sent back to a point
just outside Ronssoy where an Advanced Dress-
ing Station was afterwards formed.
During these hours there was an absence of
information from the 9th Brigade, but at about
half past ten word came from there, and the
pack train carrying water was sent forward.
Owing to a misunderstanding, this train went
too far, and wandering into a particularly hot
corner, one of the men and all of the horses
were killed by machine gun bullets.
The battalion bearers and reserve bearers, as
has been mentioned before, were in a position
outside Lempire. They occupied old German
dug-outs, and there was no rest from enemy
shell.
During the attack of the Americans at zero,
tanks and armoured cars had been used, and a
good number of these had come to grief through
running into booby traps and land mines left by
the Germans. These derelicts being naturally
in full vision by the enemy were treated to a
liberal allowance of shelling, and as this prac-
tically meant the whole of the surrounding area,


I! I -’ POST.
BTTN. 11. Q., NEAR VILLERS-BRKTTONKI'X. TYPICAL DUG-OUTS.


the lot of our infantry and bearers during this
period of inaction was not an enviable one.
Soon, however, the order came to advance,
and the troops followed in the path of the Yanks
towards Bony. Very stiff opposition was met
with on account of the Americans, new to the
game, neglecting to mop up the country passed
over. The positions were strongly held, and the
Americans who had gone on were caught be-
tween two fires, and would have been totally
annihilated if our infantry had not been able to
get through and junction with them.
Casualties were numerous, and it was only a
matter of minutes before there were over thirty
stretcher cases at the bearers’ reserve post at
the Sunken Road. These were got back by pass-
ing them through an American R.A.P. and
thence back to Ronssoy.
By this time the Unit Head-quarters had been
moved forward to Bassi Boulogne, and shortly
after its establishment there, the position was
heavily shelled. One of the attendant Ambu-
lance cars >vas put out of action. On the way up
to this post several of the cars had been damaged
by flying shell splinters.
The walking wounded were sent back from
the front on motor lorries to our walking
wounded post near Villers-Faucon. Here they
were given a warm drink and loaded in trucks,
mostly covered, on a light railway, and thus con-
veyed back to the C.C.S. The flow through
this post was a very heavy one, and night and
day American, English, and Australian wounded
were passing through. Orderlies, well equipped
with stimulants, etc., accompanied each train-
load.
Right forward the bearers were doing mag-
nificent work, labouring as they did in a constant
shelling with gas shell and high explosives. As
soon as any of them were wounded or gassed
their places were taken by reserve bearers and
the game went on. As the evening closed in, re-
ports came back to Head-quarters from Major
Samson’s main collecting post that very heavy
gas shelling was happening, and that there was a
congestion of wounded there. Cars were im-
mediately sent forward to get the cases away.
A chance shell about this time fell in the place
where the cars were parked, and, putting three
Talbots out of action, did much towards dis-
organising the whole of the car service. After
this occurrence the car park was moved to a spot
further back along the road, and instructions
were issued to the bearers to carry their cases to
them there.
To relieve a reported congestion at the bearer
relay post forward, two horsed Ambulances were
dispatched. It was as dark as pitch, and thanks
to the ever present rain, there were tons of mud
everywhere. When the vehicles were loaded and
started back, they got off the track in the dark
and both got bogged. Every effort was made to
get them out, but all the available man power
was not equal to the task. The patients were
accordingly made as comfortable as circum-
stances would permit till morning. When day-
light came, teams of mules were obtained from
some machine gunners, and the waggons were
safely pulled out on to the main road.
In the early hours of the morning, owing to
increased casualties, there was again a con-
gestion at the Main Collecting Post at Bassi
Boulogne, and all the available men at Head-
quarters and all available cars were immediately
sent there. The advent of additional American
Ambulance Cars at this time made things easier,
and by 5 a.m. all posts were clear of wounded
and things were going normally.
In order to keep in touch with the infantry,
it was now found necessary to move the posts
forward, and the personnel at Sart Farm moved
and took up a new position in a dug-out on the
Bony-Hargicourt Road. Cases were brought to
this post from the 9th and 11th Brigades and
were evacuated by our cars back to the Advanced
Dressing Station. From this post one officer and
two men were detailed to go forward to the town
of Bony, and to prepare and hold a forward
loading post for the stunt which was to occur the
next morning. This stunt, however, was can-
celled. From the post they occupied, the enemy
advanced posts were only a few hundred yards
distant.


The post on the Bony-Hargicourt Road was
again moved forward, and this time was estab-
lished in a chateau in the town of Bony. There
some of the battalion bearers reported, while the
remainder moved with the Brigade and rejoined
the Unit later at St. Emilie.
On the second of October, arrangements were
made for the relief of the division, and accord-
ingly all bearers at the Bony Post, with the ex-
ception of one squad, fell back to the post
previously occupied on the Hargicourt Road to
await relief. This happened next morning when
a R.A.M.C. Ambulance came along in scattered
batches, though an action was in progress at the
time, and wounded were coming through. Every
assistance was given the incoming Unit in the
way of helping with cars and men, stretchers
and blankets.
German prisoners were utilised in cleaning
up operations, and when the handing over was
completed, the Ninth moved out of their various
posts, leaving them as had been their wont right
through the game, in a scrupulously clean and
tidy condition. Falling back to St. Emilie, the
men were there arranged in marching order, and
started back on the road towards their place of
long promised long rest. Major Smyth’s party
moved as a separate body, joining up with the
main body that night.
During our stay in the line our casualties,
wounded and gassed, had been heavy, but only
one man, Driver Norman Roberts, of the Horse
Transport, was called on to yield up his life. He
had been wounded in the arm and was on his
way back to the dressing station when an enemy
machine gun bullet reached him, and yet another
name was added to the Unit Honour Roll. He
was a good fellow and a willing worker. His
turnout it was that took the prize in the Brigade
competition at Rivery.
During the whole of the operations the work
of the Ambulance Cars was excellent. The
drivers exposed themselves continuously to heavy
fire, both gas and H.E. They never seemed at
a loss, and did their job bravely and well. The
N.C.O. in charge had no easy time of it, keep-
ing the cars on the road; in fact, on one oc-
casion he kept one car going by patching it up
with duplicate parts souvenired from one that
had run up against a shell from Jerry, with
rather disastrous effects to itself.
The evacuations throughout were extremely
difficult. The roads were bad, always under
shell fire, and boggy from the rain. The casual-
ties were very heavy, 75 per cent, of them being
Americans.
Owing to the hold up of the Americans early
in the fray, the advanced posts had been estab-
lished too far forward, but when our infantry
got busy and completed the work, they were in
their proper position, and very many difficulties
in the way of the evacuations were removed.
‘Then again, information from the actual line
was very scanty, and it was quite unknown to
us at times where the front line just was.
Chapter XX.
The nights of the 3rd and 4th of October we
passed under canvas on the side of the main
road, at a place called St. Pierre Farm. The
morning of the 4th was spent in getting back to
the Unit the extra gear and mobilisation stores
which had been stored in Peronne, and in re-
loading the waggons. Next day, soon after din-
ner, the Horse Transport, under the command of
Captain Bridge, moved off, and they were fol-
lowed shortly afterwards by the main body of
the Ambulance.
A short march along the Peronne Road, and
the personnel were loaded on the pony train of
a light railway and carried to the outskirts of
Peronne. From there they marched to the en-
training point on the broad gauge railway;
after arrival there, their wait for a train was an
extremely long one. It came along at last, how-
ever, and a cold morning found us detraining
in early daylight at the Railway Station at
Araisnes. A little forethought had caused the
cooks to be sent on in advance by car, and on
arrival we were backed up by a drink of hot
tea.
From there to the village we were destined
to rest in was some sixteen kilometres, and as


Tommy route marches were practically unknown
hereabouts, we set out per boot, just a wee bit
tired and most anxious to get the whole thing
over. The roads. here were not of the cobble
stone variety, which, from constant use up north,
we had learned to hate so heartily, but decent
macadamised ones, and as the going was good,
the miles of the journey were not bush ones.
Shortly after mid-day we reached Neuville-au-
Bois, which was to be our abiding place for our
frequently promised long rest.
Head-quarters was established in a chateau,
and preparations made for a long stay. Not the
least of these preparations was the commence-
ment on the part of the men to dig themselves
in. Billets had been earmarked for the boys in
various barns and outbuildings, but ere many
days had passed they certainly were not over-
crowded, for dinky beds and private rooms had
been secured by many of the boys.
Meanwhile “B” Section, with their sectional
0.C., Major Smyth, in charge, proceeded to an-
other village, Vaux-Marquenville, about a kilo-
metre distant, and found lodgement there. The
place occupied was a deserted farm house of two
stories in a fairly decent state of repair. The
lower floor was reserved for a Brigade Hospital,
and the upper loft served as sleeping quarters
for the men..
Our C. 0., Lieut.-Col. Jolley, who had been
early in the fray and had left Australia in 1914,
now that things were quiet, took advantage of
the six months’ furlough scheme drawn up for
the benefit of the original Anzacs. Instead of
going to. Australia, he changed his state of single
blessedness and spent a long honeymoon touring
the, British Isles. Before his furlough ended,
hp fell sick, and was forced to go into hospital
in England, and sailing for Australia when con-
valescent, did not again rejoin his Unit.
During his absence Major Smyth assumed
command of the Ambulance, and continued to be
its C.O. till it was demobilised, but not as a Major,
for the heavens let some stars fall and find a
resting place on his shoulders—they turned him
into a.Lieut.-Colonel.
Not long after our arrival in this rest area, the
Spanish Influenza made its appearance amongst
the infantry boys, and more room being required
for patients, the bearers at the hospital were
removed and billeted in Neuville-au-Bois, and
what had been their quarters , was opened up as
an additional ward.
Soon, however, space was again cramped, and
the outhouses were temporarily repaired and
used to house patients. During the nine weeks
we were carrying on this hospital, which, when
the epidemic was at its height took in influenza
cases only, nearly seven hundred ; cases passed
through our hands, and out of all the cases only
two, and these were amongst the number evacu-
ated to the General Hospital at Abbeville, suc-
cumbed to the after effects of the disease.
A party of men of “ C ” tent sub-division were
dispatched to the village of Hallencourt, and
there opened up a prophylactic hospital, which
they conducted during our stay in these parts.
During the Unit’s stay in Neuville-au-Bois,
football was the sport most generally indulged
in. A team from the Ambulance competed in a
competition for the 9th Brigade with varying
results. Route marches were sometimes on the
cards, but as a rule the boys’ time was their own
and they spent it as suited themselves.
That their time had been well spent was rather
amply proved when the day of their departure
came round. The evident sorrow of the in-
habitants when our boys bade them farewell
showed how much they had done to augment the
entente cordiale, and proved that, not only in
time of war, but also in the days of peace, was it
possible for clean-living Australians to give their
homeland, Australia, the boosting advertisement
she so richly deserves.
Early in November, Furphy Kings were very
much in evidence, and their tales all went to say
that the end of the war was not far off. Cer-
tainly they had a deal to go on, for Jerry was,
as the boys said, getting it fair in the neck, and
his power of hitting back was, every day, getting
weaker. There, was the top dog spirit in all the
troops on our side of the line, and it would not
be many weeks before.the Yanks would be well


into the game, for as yet they had only done a
trial gallop or two.
Thus we were in a way prepared for the
momentous news that hit us on the morning of
the 12th, that an Armistice had been signed, and
that the days of “Apres la guerre” had really
come.
And when we read those Armistice terms we
knew that it was the end; we knew that no more
would we be called on to do the things we had
been doing, and we knew that at last those
womenkind of ours in far away Australia, who
had been watching and waiting for us, would be
brightened and cheered with the knowledge that
their vigil was soon to end. During the days
that followed after the Armistice news, our
thoughts were not in France, nor yet in Belgium,
and our talk dealt wholly and solely of “Old
Aussie. ’ ’
GETTING BACK FROM THERE.
Chapter XXI.
After a stay at Neuville for nine weeks, the
wireless operators again started to get busy, and
once more they delivered correct messages. Now
that peace was assured, the work of the de-
mobilisation of the huge British Army had to be
commenced. Billeting areas for this purpose
were necessary on the Continental side of the
Channel, and the area in which we were became
earmarked. When the news was bruited about
the village that we would soon be leaving, sup-
pers and feeds became the order of each evening.
The inhabitants were lavish with their in-
vitations to supper, and many of the boys dined
almost every day with kindly hosts. It has been
ordained, however, that all good things must
end, and this condition of things finished on
December the 9th. On that day the Unit, with
the exception of two small holding parties, set
out on a route march to their new resting place,
Valines, a village about twenty kilometres away.
Reaching there the same evening, the personnel
were billeted amongst the villagers, and a hos-
pital was opened up in an empty two-storied
house. This place, so village gossip said, was
haunted, but our fellows who had not been afraid
of things decidedly material were not likely to
be much put out by things which were not
material. Anyhow, the ghost has not walked
since our arrival. Perhaps it does not talk our
language.
“C” Section tent sub. took over the Hospital,
and the remainder of the boys occupied their
time in the ordinary routine of camp fatigues
and duties.
The educational classes were here advanced
further stages and were well attended. The
Unit was lucky in having such wealth of material
amongst its personnel to draw from, to act as
teachers. Truly one never knew who he was
going to meet in the ranks of the A.I.F.
The piano previously mentioned had been
brought along with us in our wanderings, and
the school house having been placed at our
disposal each evening by the school teacher, we
were enabled to while away many a hour in song
and dances. Twice weekly, on Tuesday and
Saturday nights, dances were held, and though
at first they were what is known in the ver-
nacular as “buck dances,” later on they were
patronised by the town belles and developed into
mixed assemblies of some class.
A Debating Club also came into being, and
on one night each week debates were held, and
the pros and cons of many weighty subjects were
thrashed out to the entire satisfaction of an
always critical, but appreciative audience.
All this time, while these enjoyable hours were
passed away indoors, out-door sports were not
allowed to die down. Football of all kinds, bas-
ket ball, and badminton were the favourites,
and the sports ground, handily placed near the
town, was the scene of many a well-contested
struggle.
The end of the year was approaching, and
grand preparations were made to pass the festive
season, as the Ninth had always striven to pass
it well. The countryside was searched for eat-
ables, mainly in the poultry line, and that the
search was successful the Christmas dinner fully
proved.


XMAS DI.WNKK, VALINKS, 1«I8.


The tables for the spread of the men occupied
the two large rooms at the school house, and the
tasteful decorations of holly bush and streamers,
formed an apt setting for the wealth of good
things that the tables bore.
While dinner was in progress, Colonel
Maguire, the A.D.M.S., paid a visit, and in a few
words handed out the compliments of the season
to the assembled lads. He also repeated the
courtesy at the Sergeants’ mess, and, as was his
custom, had one with them.
Arrangements had been under way for some
time for the demobilisation of the Unit. These
were made by a staff under the guidance of
S.-Sergeant Johns, and had been busy collecting
data and arranging the men in the different ■
categories, under the different headings of the
scheme laid down.
With the coming of the new year came also in-
creased interest on the part of the men in these
proceedings, and when the 1915 men, who had
joined the Unit as reinforcements from time to
time, had been all warned for early repatriation
and sent across to Blighty, this interest increased
to somewhere near fever pitch. It had now be-
come a question, not of who would be the next to
go, but of when would the next lot go.
All sorts of tales and rumours floated round
the camp. One persistent rumour said that a
certain percentage of the men would be marked
“cadre,” and if so marked would have to stop
till the last for repatriation. This, receiving con-
firmation from Head-quarters, caused a vast
amount of speculation as to whose names would
be on the list, but the publication of the names
soon made surmise reality.
The amount of sympathy that these listed men
or “cadres,” as they had been officially desig-
nated with a certain amount of dry humour,
met with amongst the boys was immense.
Even sympathy in some cases becomes annoy-
ing, and so it was in this case. Sympathisers
sometimes got forcibly sharp answers from the
“cadres” for their pains.
Conjecture was ripe as to how the “cadres”
would get back finally, and one of the visions of
the last parade of the Ambulance on its landing
in Australia was as follows. The scene is laid
on the street outisde the wharf:
The quarter-master is acting as orderly of-
ficer, the sergeant-clerk is orderly sergeant, while
the sole remaining representative of the men is
the C.O. ’s batman. The roll has been called and
the O.S. reports to the 0.0., who in turn reports
to the C.O. that all is correct. “Very well,”
says the C. 0., “Carry on, Mr. Poole; I want to
get home to see the kiddy.” In his turn the
0.0. hands the order to “carry on” on to the
sergeant-clerk with the remark that he wants to
see a man about a dog. Left to his own devices,
the sergeant calls the parade of one to attention,
and telling it to “P.O. toot sweet,” hurries away
to see that she has not forgotten him. As a col-
lection of motley individuals the Unit had
started, and so it finished, though the collection
was smaller, much smaller. The R.Q.M.S. was,
of course, exempt from this parade. He was
making a last attempt to make good the short-
ages in Mob. stores.
During these days it was quite a habit for
Boards of Officers to sit. They sat on the
slightest provocation, and seemed to take a de-
light in holding enquiries in to deficiencies in
mobilisation stores. The records of their de-
liberations built up a huge store of useful infor-
mation, and with such things to guide the men at
the head, the organisation of Ambulances in the
next war should be on a much better basis than
it was during this small mix-up. There will not
be things included in the stores like Field Frac-
ture Boxes, to be carried during the days of war,
not to be made use of once, and to be dumped
when the Armistice is signed.
As the days of February were drawing to a
close, Australia seemed to be much nearer. The
bulk of the horses were returned to the collecting
depot, and all the mobilisation stores were
polished up preparatory to doing the same with
them.
Every member of the Unit was medically ex-
amined, and then appeared before a medical
board. This, no doubt, had some sort of a bear-
ing on the question of pensions, but the part of
the performance the boys took most interest in


was the answer written in against the question—
“ Fit for General Service?”—so keen were they
in the game they now had a jersey in.
The first draft of men got away to base en
route for pre-embarkation camps in England, in
the middle of March, and the Unit was shrivel-
ling fast. Then came the absorption of the men
who were left, by the 11th Field Ambulance.
The . cadres, true to the last, as they had been
told to be, saw the stores and equipment handed
in, and then also joined up with the 11th. There
were practically only cadres left in the division
now, and one Ambulance would suffice. The
discovery on the part of the Authorities that it
was cheaper to keep one home than two, caused
this absorption of what was left of the Ninth,
and as a separate Ambulance it officially ceased
to exist.
For over three years it had hung together,
carrying on its job, passing the ups and downs,
taking the good with the bad. It had started
with hopes, and it finished with the recoiling
hopes of a quick return to Australia.
To those of its members who have once more
set foot in the sunny land of their birth, there
comes at times a thought of those mates who
sleep the long sleep “over there.” They, indeed,
were mates, comrades of the right sort, not the
kind that reign for a time in one’s esteem and
are then forgotten. No, whatever time is,
whither our wandering thoughts have the power
of straying, those heroes who died as only men
know how to die, will have a place in our
memories.
Afterwards there will be something wanting
in our happiness when Old Charon has ferried
us across The Styx if we do not meet them on
the other side and renew in spirit mateship the
bonds that bound us as comrades in the flesh.
EDUCATIONAL.
Following out the idea of the A.I.F. to in-
stitute a General Educational Scheme through-
out the Australian Forces during the period of
awaiting demobilisation, the 9th Field Ambu-
lance took its first steps towards this end early
in October, 1918.
The intentions of the Education Department
of the A.I.F. were that, until hostilities actually
ceased, the scheme should be carried out as far
as possible by the institution of educational
classes within Units, the full development of
activities not being considered practicable while
the needs of the military situation were likely to
interfere with a definitely organised system of
schools. After the cessation of hostilities it was
hoped that big steps could be taken in this
direction, and arrangements would be made to
afford facilities for instruction in any subject
that the members of the A.I.F. might require.
The Ambulance had been relieved from duty
in the forward fighting area on October sth, and
had settled down in the village of Neuville-au-
Bois, near Abbeville, for a period of rest. It
was considered that this was an opportune time
to begin educational work, and accordingly a
committee was appointed and a syllabus of
classes arranged. Study was commenced about
a fortnight afterwards.
The scheme was taken up enthusiastically at
the outset, but the necessity of military duties
being carried out interferred to some extent with
attendances, especially as the lads showed a dis-
inclination to pick up with the work again if
they missed a lesson or two. Under these con-
ditions the classes were carried on in a desultory
fashion for several w T eeks, but with no great
success.
Then came the signing of the Armistice and
the cessation of hostilities on November 11th,
1918. Shortly after this the Education Depart-
ment in khaki began to set in operation its full
scheme. Propaganda continuously circulated, re-
awakened interest within the Unit, and it was
decided to form a new Committee and begin
again. This Committee consisted of a repre-
sentative of the commanding officer (Major
Fitzpatrick, M.C.); Secretary, Pte. Dive; Organ-
ising Secretary, Pte. Healey; Registrar, Pte.
Dash: and the teachers and instructors. All
work done was under the supervision of the Unit
Educational Officer, Lieut. Steele (shared with
tJ.e other two Ambulances of the Division).


After some preparatory canvassing work, a
time table was drawn up to suit the requirements
of students as far as possible, and was to come
into operation on the 9th of December. How-
ever, on that day an unexpected move took place,
and the Unit occupied fresh quarters in the vil-
lage of Valines. Two days afterwards the classes
commenced. The village school room was worked
overtime, and was utilised for evening classes.
Morning classes were held in an estaminet, for
the villagers do not, as a rule, drink much before
dinner, and the afternoons were spent in sport.
The subjects included in this time table were
Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, English, French,
Science, Shorthand, and Bookkeeping. Lessons
of an hour’s duration, two or three times a week,
being given in each subject. As time went on,
the Syllabus was enlarged by the addition of
classes in English Literature, Advanced French,
and Building Construction and Drawing.
The number of the members of the Unit at-
tending classes averaged about 25 per cent, of
the strength. This percentage is not as low as it
may appear when the fact is taken into con-
sideration that there were many men in the Unit
requiring advanced Technical and Professional
instruction which could not be given them on
account of lack of suitable instructors. These
men, however, were catered for by schools ar-
ranged at various. centres under the A.I.P.
general scheme.
Owing to the fact that demobilisation came
about quicker than had been expected this
scheme of general schools did not go quite as far
as had been intended, but nevertheless it went
quite far enough to be of immense benefit to the
men, and was availed of by very many soldiers
anxious for educational advancement.
Eighteen of the lads of the Ambulance have
been attached to schools of instruction in Tech-
nical Agriculture and academic subjects for
perids of time varying from a few weeks up to
three months.
In the classes held within the Unit there was
considerable difficulty in the early days in
obtaining suitable text books, but these were
afterwards amply supplied by the Central
Library at Head-quarters. From the same
source came along a very liberal allowance of
books for reference purposes, far too expensive
for individual purchase. With the addition of
these books, the Units’ reference library consisted
of about forty works.
In addition to this there had also been in ex-
istence for some time a good Fiction Library,
the books being at intervals changed through the
channel of the Y.M.C.A.
As an adjunct to the instructional classes it
was decided to form a Debating Club, and under
the guidance of a Committee of three, its life
has been a happy one. It was successful from the
jump off, and was carried on for some time with
a good regular attendance and no lack of
speakers in support of the contesting sides.
Visiting lecturers came along at intervals,
mostly under the mothering wing of the
Y. Emma, and discoursed to us on topics of
. general interest. One of these, Mr. Blackshaw,
who had been interned in Germany during the
early days of the war, after getting to within
one hundred yards of the Dutch frontier, well
within the twenty-four hours’ grace always al-
lowed in civilised countries after the declaration
of war, told us just how things were across the
Rhine as he saw them. Of high and absorbing
interest were the things he related. In another
lecture he treated of the peace treaties of the
20th century, and, as before, he held us from
start to finish.
Coming under the heading of things educa-
tional might also be ranked the writing up of the
Unit history. This was entrusted to Captain
Webb, S.-Sgt. Mooney, and L.-Cpl. Cunningham,
and Ptes. Watson and Lawless. The job was
rather a big one, and many difficulties were en-
countered on the way. The work entailed the
gathering together of an immense quantity of
data and material, and in the doing of this, in this
big push for knowledge, Base Records, where
everything was stored, proved to be nearly a
Verdun. The result of the historians’ labour is
within these covers, and what it lacks in style it
makes up for in veracity. Perhaps it is a blunt
tale bluntly told, but nevertheless that it is true


in every detail is vouched for by every member of
the 9th Australian Field Ambulance.

The next item on the Bill of Pare presented by
the Committee was a mock election for the
Mayoral Chair of Valines. Three candidates
came forward, and everybody entered into the
spirit of things with great gusto. The election
ended in the return of Pte. O’Dea, who was too
much of an Irishman in his promises for the
other candidates.
Shortly after this, a mock trial was arranged,
and one of the senior N.C.O.’s connected with
the Horse Transport was summarily arrested
and charged with various offences contrary to
discipline, but not contrary to a good time.
There was much evidence for and against, but
the judge’s verdict was “Not guilty.”
The departure of the first draft of the person-
nel for Australia not long after this caused the
Debating Club to quietly “take the count”; but
it had served its purpose, and had made many an
hour of the period of waiting seem less long and
easier to bear.
THE WORK OF THE MOTOR
AMBULANCES.
In early November, in England, before the
Division moved to France, when the equipment
of the Division was nearing completion, the
motor drivers of the Unit received orders to
report to Bulford Motor Transport Depot. Re-
porting there, seven Ambulance Cars, consisting
of five Talbots and two Fords were issued to
them. The day following, in company with the
cars of fourteen other Ambulances, this section


of the Unit proceeded to Bath, and joined up
Avith the 3rd D.S.C. Here billets Avere found for
all hands in vacant houses.
The cars remained parked in the street for
nearly tAvo weeks, after which they AA'ere driven
to Avonmouth for shipment to Rouen. The
drivers, returning to Bath for a few days, event-
ually left for France on November 25th.
The crossing Avas just as Avere all Channel
crossings at this time—one of cold discomfort
and sea sickness. They were landed at Le Havre
about 6 a.m. the following morning, and march-
ing up to what seemed to them an interminable
hill to No. 1 Rest Camp, had there 36 hours of
inaction in its mud. A troop train trip to Rouen
folloAved. On arrival there they Avere marched
quite seven miles to cover four, but they had a
capable English Military Guide Avith them, and
this fact possibly explains the strange and tiring
tramp. At Rouen the cars Avere picked up, and
after a stay of three days, mainly spent in
touching up the ’busses, a start Avas made by
road for Armentieres. The distance Avas coA r ered
in four days. On the trip, camps Avere made by
the roadside each night, stops being made at
Abbeville, St. Pol and Estaires.
The journey was uneventful and without
accident, but it was a mighty cold one. On
arrival at Armentieres they rejoined the Unit
and took over duty from the English Ambulances
then working that sector. For some time work
was easy, but each morning much energy and
breath (in the form of blessings called down on
the cars, especially the Fords) was expended
before the engines could be got going, due to the
extreme cold of the weather and the poorness of
the petrol.
Until May the easy times continued, but then,
what a change! Work became very constant
and considerably more lively, due to the at-
tentions the enemy always paid to the roads.
This continued, gradually growing worse, until
about June 4th, when the bombardment of roads,
guns and dumps was at its height. About this
time our ears began to catch it, and three were
put out of action by flying shell fragments.
Then eame the eve of Messines with its gas, H.E.,
and casualties. Here the Avork became very
difficult as it Avas not possible for the drivers to
drive in gas masks OAving to their inability to
see clearly through, and very feAV of them came
out of this ordeal Avithout feeling its effects in
some Avay or other.
The AA r eek during the operations at Messines
had undoubtedly been the liveliest to date, and
many narroAV squeaks Avere chronicled, particu-
larly at Hyde Park Corner, Ploergsteert and
Regina Camp, Avhere the passage at times seemed
to be absolutely impossible for any vehicle.
Luck held, hoAvever, and the cars all got through
AA'ith slight damage only. Before the finish tAvo
more cars AA'ere knocked out, however, and the
average of five damaged out of a total of seven,
proved only too Avell that the roads Avere not
neglected by the Bosche.
The work then settled into the old routine,
until in July, cars were detached to assist the
10th and 11th Field Ambulances for the thirty-
six days that these tAvo Units held Kandahar
Farm Sector. This period was indeed a rough
one, as the roads Avere seldom in a properly
passable state, due to heavy bombardments, and
many lively and anxious moments were passed
at Goosebery Farm, Boyle’s Farm, and Wolverg-
liam Corner. During these times one of the cars
was" as far fonvard as Whizz Bang Corner, but
as this Avas only a mud heap, it was not practic-
able for general use. *
The Fourth Division then relieved our Divi-
sion on this part of the front, but one of the
cars remained on duty with them for another
two weeks until the Ambulance proceeded into
Rest Area.
Rest! Well, yes, there was rest there, but not
for the Motor Transport. The runs they made
were certainly enjoyable to an extent, but five
or six hundred miles per week is hardly rest.
Nevertheless all hands enjoyed their spell away
from the line till a start was made on that mem-
orable march to Ypres.
On the march, the job of the motors was to
pick up sick and sore men, and they were kept
pretty busy all day, so that the rest at night
was not at all unwelcome.


Then came Ypres—a nightmare of mud and
traffic such as has never been seen anywhere
else. .Here the Fords went forward to work
between Bavaria House and the White Chateau
A.D.S., as feeders to the larger cars which
worked back on the long run to the Corps M.D.S.
at Brandhock. On this job the Talbots were
attached to the 6th M.A.C., and worked on cir-
cuit with the English and New Zealand cars,
so that for days we would not see our own cars,
which were sent to the Willye Sector, occupied
by the New Zealanders. The Fords during the
Ypres operations did fine work, going up and
down that miserable and well-strafed road day
and night. Often, very often, they arrived at
their destination covered in mud, splashed by a
bursting shell landing close to them somewhere
en route. No matter how hot it got, the drivers
never failed. On one occasion a shell, lodging
in the middle of the road just in front of a car,
covered it with mud. The driver had to get
down and fill the hole in with shell-cases and
debris before he could get his car along. During
the second Ypres stunt, however, the “Joeys,”
as the boys called the smaller cars, did not come
right up to the duty mark, and had to be re-
placed by the Talbots. These latter could only
run as far as what was known as The Loop,
for there, a huge mine crater, fair in the road,
made motor traffic on the far side a negligible
quantity.
Out of Ypres with a thankful feeling and a
mental note that they would certainly “remem-
ber Belgium,” a period of quietness and com-
parative ease was entered into that lasted until
March, 1918, when the move south started.
This was alright until Cachy was reached, and
on the morning of April Ist the quarters were
heavily strafed by Jerry, and a hasty move was
made to join up with the Unit, then at Gent-
elles. Then the fun started. The runs were
long, and all the roads new and strange.
All evacuations from the M.D.S. to the C.C.S.
had to be carried out by the cars, as it was not
possible to get any M.A.C. cars to assist for
several days. As the depth of the line of evac-
uation was a matter of more than twenty miles,
sleep was almost an impossibility for anyone.
The dizzy limit was reached on the 4th of
April, when Villers-Bretonneux caught it so
hot. However, the luck of the 9th stuck. Our
cars came through well. They were backwards
and forwards all day in that miniature inferno,
and the fact that they came down almost every
time with bricks and fragments of mortar on
their canopies, shows how close the running
must have been.
They did their job, and all things considered,
that is saying everything. The work after this
gradually eased off, and as communications
were re-established, the lot of our motor men
became much easier. The way they kept the
business going was due solely to the big hearts
of the drivers—men who very often had to go
forty-eight hours without sleep.
Right up to August things were easy, but with
the advent of our new offensive work soon be-
came hard and lively too. The passage of La
Motte en Santerre and Warfusee was always a
trying one, as the road traffic was horribly con-
gested, and the aeroplane bombing by night was
extremely tough. There was constant work for
the cars during the operations at Cerisy and
Hamel, and very little sleep for the drivers.
On the northern side of the river the aptly-
named Happy Valley provided the necessity for
many fast trips and the approach to Suzanne
was at one time anything but healthy. In this
advance the Ford cars again shone out, always
being well forward where there was something
doing.
The advance caused the lines of communica-
tion to stretch out considerably, but the cars
hung together, safely did the long trips neces-
sary, and were on the spot when wanted.
Then came the last—St. Emilie to Ronsoy.
This was, perhaps, the worst shelled stretch of
road the cars had yet struck, and it was un-
interruptedly lively. Here the cars did not
escape seathless, for several “caught their issue”
on this stretch of road, and a lot of repair work
was rendered necessary.
The going back of the division afforded the
cars a well earned rest, and the Armistice put


an end to their line work. During the whole of
this time only two of our cars were lost—one
Ford at Gentelles on April 3rd, and one Talbot
near Oisemont on November 9th. The loss of
the former was due to a collapsed rear wheel,
rendering it necessary to abandon the car. It
was salvaged later, but in the meantime it had
suffered more damage, and being useless, was
evacuated. The Talbot was evacuated after
collision with a tree one misty night. The
damage to the tree was slight, but the car was
badly bent. During the period of their active
service from the landing in France to the
Armistice Day, our cars travelled 150,000 miles
and used up 15,000 gallons of petrol.
THE 45th DENTAL UNIT.
During the whole of the time that the Ambu-
lance has been carrying on, it has had attached
to it a Dental Unit to look after the teeth of the
fighting men. The allotment for the Ambulance
consisted of an officer, two staff sergeants and
an orderly. Every class of dental surgery and-
mechanical dentistry was thus made available
to the men, and they were thus enabled to keep
their teeth right up to the mark. It was a fore-
sighted arrangement, and has worked splendidly
right through.
To give some idea of the immense amount of
good arising from the organisation, both towards
the individual soldier, and through him, by
keeping him fit, to the common cause, let me
give a brief resume in figures of the work in
that line done by the Ninth Field Ambulance.
From the end of November, 1916, the time of
arrival in France, up to the Armistice, cover-
ing roughly a period of two years, the figures
are as follows: —
Members of the A.I.F. treated .. 8,845
