fUmxmactttas of a Meator*
TO A FRIEND IN BRISBANE,
THE WHITER HAD NOT HEARD OF FOR OVER
TWENTY YEARS.
River Street, Richmond,
Yarraberg, July 27, 1878.
Dear Jamie, when I read your note,
I stood transfixed upon the spot ;
I could do nought but stand and stare ?
My soul had flown to Ralston Square,?
And sure as I had breath to draw,
Baith you and Willie there I saw,
And th? auld Relief Kirk, neat and trigg,
And soon I passed auld ? Borland?s Brigg
Straight to tbe winding causey side,
Where in my youth I met ray bride ;
To the saucel next I quick did rin,
There was the Haraills and the Linn,
Where, often tired, straight frae the loom,
In simmer nights I used to soom.
I gazed across at the seed hills,
The nest for weavers and thread mills ;
There stood the building nane the waur,
Where I wove shawls for Bobby Kerr.
The mill bells noo began to toll.
There was the ? Sun,? and Nellie Bole.
I could not pass, ?twas ?gainst my will,
I steppit in and ca?ed a gill ;
There sat blin? Davie, Geordy Martin,
The catgut they were freely scartin,
Jock Martin, Thalan, Geordy -Wallace,
Happy as kings in ony palace.


At length, amidst the noise and fun,
I toomed my stoup, and left the ? Sun.?
Roun? by the cross I then did steer,
When plump I cam on Danie Weir,
Wi? bosom bare, and sturdy leg,
Telling the tale o? ? Wat and Meg.?
At corner o? the Water Wynd,
Stood twa three chaps o? simple twyne ;
Ane cried to Danie, u Man, you?re daft.?
? That s true,? said Dan, and quietly laugbt;
"Ira daft, and kens o?t, there?s an end o?t,
? But you?re clean daft, and disna ken o?t.?
While some wi? laughing loud did roar,
I took a glance down to the Score;
There was wee Clear Head in a flurry,
Bustling along in hurry-skurry ;
As proud and game as ony rooster,
And ready, too, for Patrick Brewster.
Poor Paisley?s wrangs he did bewail,
And curs?d ? soup kitchens,? scones, and kail
Then, passing through the hole in the wa?,
I bought a fish frae Willie Shaw ;
He was filling sweeties into pocks,
And selling them to country Jocks.
The shows stood in a stately raw,
And by a drum there stood Meg Shaw ;
The showmen kicking up a row,
Swallowing swords and bleezing tow ;
Close by ray side, just at ray lug,
There stood the Win? man and his dog,
Wi? his wee peep show, and fast describing
Napoleon on his white horse riding.
The habby horses, Waterloo flies,
The plum-cakes, dulce, wilks, bawbee pies,
Wi" glorious dauds o' real black man ;
Wi miscamons in a muckle pan.
I left the shows and, in my range,
I passed ? Pie Mairs,? and the ? Exchange ? ?
Where Groodlet, Drummond, Locke and White,
Oft charmed me wi? their sangs at night.


Next to the west I bent my way,
I keekit up the Heigh Kirk brae,
Where wee McNaughton used to preach,
And holy truths to scoonrels teacb.
Then showbooks and sangs, and George Caldwell,
Flashed through ray mind ?here?s Wilson Hall ;
A calm, serene, benevolent face,
I spied within that once loved place.
?Twas Glasford ?man o? sterling worth,
A better never trod the earth ;
There?s Motherwell, too, a man of sense,
Weel can he reckon pounds and pence ;
Auld Wilson, too, that hearty cock,
There?s few wi? him can crack a joke;
There?s printer Smith, that merry chiel,
Wurbling about just like an eel ;
Ye?ll ne?er catch Johnny in a trance,
He?s fidging fain to join the dance ;
The ithers oft I think upon,
But here I?m at the ? Lady Lone,?
My heart gaed dnnt, I made a stan?,
?Twas here I once my watch did pawn ;
But want o? meal or maut, or wark,
Did never make me pawn my sark.
Noo here I?m at the auld hut brae,
Where I?ve passed raony a happy day.
When cholera on us made war,
?Twas here we bleezed big barrels o? tar ;
And in revenge for those we?d lose,
We tore the coffins frae the moss,
That held instead of flesh and banes,
A humplock o? dirt and stanes.
What splendid views I?ve often seen,
When perched upon the ? Bowling Green.?
Ye dear loved spots, my heart it swells,
Here?s ? Chalmer?s Pump,? here?s the ? Lonewells
There at the corner stands Turnbull,
Across the street there?s Puddin? Wull.
Just then I heard a loud halloa !
I lookit up, ?twas Allan Toa.


The wimmen scuddin? cross the street,
Wi? aprons fou o? Allan?s peat ;
But here I got a pawkie shove
From an auld acquaintance, Willie Love,
Who couldna rest or close his e?en
Until he?d gang and see the Queen,
Soon as he left me to mysel?,
I took a drink at ? Troutse?s Well ? ;
There, strutting wi? head high?s he could carry,
He passed me by, ?twas Bonnie Larry ;
Wi? mony mair I weel did ken,
I stoppit at the coffin enn,
Then thocht upon an awfu? shakin?
I got, when young, frae Willie Aitken,
I ne?er forgot until this day,
For stealing peas on Banks?s brae.
I thocht him then the king o? men,
When he jagged our wee heeds wi? his pen.
Noo Willie?s gane, he?s seen his day,
A kinder soul ne?er breathed in clay ;
There stood the kail barrows and horn,
The very spot where I was born.
Some sad reflections made me dowie,
I started, for I heard a coo-ey ;
That brought me back to present times,
To other lands, and other climes.
Now, Jamie, I will shortly tell
You what has happened to mysel?,
Since I frae Paisley town did wanner,
And frae a weaver turned a tanner.
We landed safe in Melbourne city,
Wi? empty pouches?raair?s the pity ;
Wi? wife and three bit helpless weans,
And ne?er a spot to rest our banes.
And in the dark, cold, muddy street,
The puir wee things began to greet;
Ae thought quick through my mind did glide,
I thocht upon my ain fireside.
At length we crept into a shed,
An? slept, the grun? our only bed ;


Next nicht wi? fiddling sn the street.
And buskin it in strains sae sweet,
We gathered shillings sixty-three,
Which filled us a? wi? mirth and glee.
The next day found me hard at wark,
In moleskin breeks and blue serge sark,
Sawing big logs, and splitting rots
For firewood, and for biggin? huts ;
Whiles digging clay and turning sods,
Wi? pick and shovel, making roads.
For twa hale years??twas not ray hobby,
I strutted through the streets, a bobby,?
I?ve had my ups and downs since then,
Amang the toiling sons of men ;
For bairns alive I?ve just got nine,
Six sons, three dochters, doing fine.
My dochter Poll did first begin
To get wee images o? sin,
Dubbin? me grandpa ower a mob
Of skirling weans, Dick, Ann, and Bob.
For raony years I crept through life,
In happiness wi? weans and wife ;
Bought a bit grun?, and built a house,
And thocht mysel? baith bein and douce ;
But black misfortune, and the law,
Left me wi? scarce a nail to claw ;
The leeches swallowed a? I had,
The thocht o?t nearly drives me mad ;
Then worst of a?, sad, sad to tell,
My life, my wife gaed by hersel?,
This six lang years her reason ?s fled,
She?s noo a wreck upon her bed ;
Of a? the ills with which I?m curst,
This last misfortune is the worst ;
And oh ! what I could write and tell?
But no !?l'll keep it to mysel?.
I canna grumble at my health,
Although I growl at want o? wealth ;
Though, when the tax-man comes his rounds,
I?m seldom short o? twa three pounds.


I see ray hair is turning grey,
Proclaiming I have had my day ;
The crowfeet gathering round my een,
Tells o? days past that I have seen ;
All things aroun? noo seems less cheery,
Nay even at times of life I?m weary.
We little think in youth and prime,
What fate is ours, as rolls on time ;
But could we think, when we were boys,
?Twould cloud our wee short dream o' joys ;
But baud, ?I?m just like ither folk,
We a? hae got our ? Bubbly Jock.?
Noo, Jamie, in your next let?s hear
How Willie is, for him I speir ;
Tell him to send a line to Johnny,
His ancient, youthfu? fiddling cronie,
He teached lang syne to play the fiddle,
And wi? him oft discussed life?s riddle.
Martin, that harum-scarum chiel,
Is in New Zealand doing weel;
Fourteen years since he took a fit,
And off he gaed wi? Colonel Pitt,
To fight the Maoris in the war,
And ?scaped without a wound or scar.
He tried to farm, but failed, alack !
And noo he?s carrying o? the pack.
Noo, Jamie, I will say nae raair,
But write me when you?ve time to spare,
And while through life I?m jogging on,
I will remain your old friend
JOHN RENTOUL.
EPISTLE TO MY SISTER.
On Her coming to Australia.
Dear Lizzie, I am busy thinking,
While round me all the bairns are winking,
Racking my silly brains ?bout you,
Wondering what you had better do.


Of course you thought cigars and wine,
Wi? taits o? snuff, would suit ye fine;
And so it would?cigars and snuff,
Would pay, could you but sell enough.
But now you fret and curse your blinkers,
Not thinking who would be the drinkers ;
The gaby Frenchman from the Rhine,
Delights in his cigars and wine ;
But bluff John Ball, at home, or here,
Will have his roast beef and his beer;
And you yoursel?, a real Scotch sandy,
Would rather hae a wee drap brandy ;
To feel real glorious, blythe and frisky,
Gie me a drap o? real Scotch whi.ky.
I?m sorry that this sunny clime,
Wi? your expectations dinna chime ;
That roughs are here as thick as bees,
Cheating, swindling, telling lees ;
They?ve catched me often (devil rust them),
We are the fools to ever trust them.
Ye ken this life?s an awfu? battle,
Come to the front and show your mettle ;
And ne?er sit down to greet or howl,
But show yoursel? a real Rentoul.
For Guid?s sake, dinna think on harae,
Where I?ve had mony a hungry wame ;
And mony ither wants and woes,
For want o? breeks and want o? brose.
When we were young and strang, and hale,
Our wee drap parritch and muslin kail,
On stomachs that were strong and tough,
For want o? else did weel enough ;
But try your brose and bannocks noo ;
Na faith, ye?d rather hae a stew ;
Instead o? parritch, a nice bit cake ;
Instead o? brose a good rump steak.
I?ve nae doubt here you may do weel,
Could you but catch some canny chiel ;
Wi? twa three hunner in his purse?
My faith, I think you might do worse.


Kae mair at nicht ye?d gape and gant,
Nae ma r ye?d feel an unco? want.
Keep up your pluck, and dinna fret,
I warrant ye?ll be happy yet.
Goodbye then, Lizz, till'next I see ye,
On Saturday I will be wi? ye.
I hope you?re hearty, hale and crouse,
And ready too to heat the house;
We?ll hae a drap, and a guid Scotch sang,
What hasna been God knows how lang;
Long may we live, true to each ither,
Is the prayer of John,
Youe Loving Beithee.
SONG.
Mothee?s Addeess to Her Child, on its
Fibst Biethday,
Tune ?? What's a' the steer , Kimmev."
Oh ! come awa? ray Kellie dear,
Come awa? to me,
And hae a wee bit n�ppy,
Upon your mither's knee ;
Wi? your wee roan? chubby face,
And your bight blue laughing ee??
Ye?re my sweet wee Kell McEwin,
And a? the warld to me.
Koo twelve months are gane, Kell,
Since first ye saw the sun ;
And mony cares and pains I?ve had,
Since your wee sweet life begun ;
But we?ll weather a? life?s storms, Kell,
We winna fret or fear ;
We?ll be honest, kind, and true, Kell,
Sae lang as we are here.


And when in after years, Nell,
You?re growing tall and fair,
Oh! few, few be your tears, Nell,
And light, light be your care ;
And ne?er forget your mither, Nell,
And your good old faither too,
And the blessings of an honest heart.
Will carry you aye through.
Beware of pomp and pride, Nell,
Of silks, and gauze, and lace,
Nae guid can they betide, Nell,
But ruin and disgrace ;
Beware of oily tongues, Nell,
And gay, deceivin? men ;
They will tell you they will marry you,
But winna tell you when.
When coming down the hill o? life,
And auld age creeping on,
Ye may think on the advice
O? your dear auld Uncle John ;
Who had sat and drank your health, Neil,
Sae many years before,
In a vine-clad cot in Yarraberg,
And the year just seventy-four.

THE OLD MAID?S ADDRESS TO HER
POODLE.
My dear little Rosy,
Come into my Bozy,
So snug, warm, and cosy,
My dear little Pet.
You are true, true to me,
No deceit is in thee,
Till the day that I dee
Thee I?ll never forget.
Oftimes when you?ve missed me,
How fond you caressed me,
If you could you would bless me,
Yon dear little rogue.
Oh what joy, peace, and mirth
Would exist on this earth,
Could we claim half the worth
Of ray dear little dog.
What though young men reject me,
That will not affect me ;
All good folks respect me,
I?m merry and free.
I?ve no husband to grumble,
My life?s smooth and humble,
We can romp, skip, and tumble,
My doggie and me.
There?s man, that proud creature.
So noble in feature,
Yet sinful by nature
Where?er he may be.
When from earth he is driven
He claims a bright heaven ;
Why should there not be given
A heaven for thee ?


ON MY FAVOURITE DOG JACK.
Oct. 25th, 1880.
Poor Jack, he is gone, the old dog had his day,
On the banks of the Yarra he?ll never more play,
He?ll never more snarl ower a crust or a bone,
Or bottom the river to catch a big stone ;
Over fences and gates he will never more spring.
At jumping ?mongst all other dogs he was king,
And amongst all his friends he could pilfer and beg,
And he oftentimes hnng on a fence by the leg.
His young days were passed full of frolic and fun,
No sportsman loved better his boat or his gun.
With what transport he?d bound over the Yarra?s cool
wave,
Ah ! little he thought he had swum o?er his grave.
His old, knowing face I can never forget,
For many long years he was everyone?s pet.
At all rural parties old Jack took his place,
He would wag his old tail and then laugh in your
But Time the old king stamped poor Jack with old
a g e >
And his old honest face became wrinkled and sage,
And the friends that caressed him so kindly before,
Now kicked him witji curses away from their door.
Poor Jack had no riches to purchase respect,
So, like man, had to suffer the world?s neglect.
For when we grow wrinkled, poor, ugly, and old,
We are served like poor Jack and kicked out in the
cold.
Alas ! my poor dog, though hard is your fate,
That fate may be mine too at no distant date.
Oh, may I not live till I?m useless and poor,
Till life is a burden and hard to endure.


A SABBATARIAN SUNDAY.
Feb. sth, 1888.
Again does the sombre curtain of gloom
Envelop our home by Miss Grundy;
Not a sound is heard from kitchen or room,
Full well do we know it is Sunday.
All is quiet as the grave, not a laugh or a jest,
As we hurriedly swallow our tea,
Then we vanish like ghosts so soon as we?ve dressed,
To the river, the gardens, or sea.
Then Miss Grtmdy sits moping and loudlyjdeclares,
As she lists to her little kirk bell,
There is nothing on earth but temptations and'snares,
And the people?s all going to H?ll.
The violins are mute, the cornets are dead,
The piano is silent for one day,
We slip up the stairs and slither to bed?
So ends our Sabbatical Sunday.
TO MISS McEWIN ON HER MARRIAGE DAY.
May , 1878,
Dear Kate, I hear you?re to be tied,
And by the lasses a? envied,
And that you?ll soon be spliced to Pate,
And lose your pretty name of Kate.
Just now your dreams of life are bright,
With youth and hope and love?s delight.
But when you're twa three years a mither,
The picture changes a? tbegither.
How it does change I winna tell,
You?re sure to find it out yoursel?.
Now mind when you become a wife,
You then begin the fight of life.
There?s one thing, Kate, you?ll never rue,
Be always to yourself most true.


"What ups and downs, what cares and fears,
May happen in a few short years.
Despise the dirty, lazy hurl,
Aye cock your beaver to the worl .
There?s dirty drabs with conduct queer,
Who?re fond of rum and sups of beer.
Wi? them, dear Kate, ne?er gang a clashing,
But stay at home and mind your washing,
Or knit a collar for the cat ?
Do any mortal thing but that.
For soon?s you join that she convention.
As sure as fate your past redemption.
Be to your husband kind and true,
Consult him aye whate?er you do ;
And when at times you will have words
As sharp and keen as two-edged swords,
Don?t cut too keen, Kate, always fear,
And never let vour bairnies hear
The angry words pass ?tween you baith,
They?ll recollect them to their death.
But why begin a moralising,
When all around should be rejoicing ?
Kow let me whisper in your lug,
My present is a nice bit rug.
I wish that I could make it malr,
But lord, ye ken I?m unco pair?
Sae puir that naebody will len me,
Sae puir that very few noo ken me.
It?s neither lion, bear, nor cat,
Opossum, squirrel, or wild rat.
?Twas catched far, far frae me and you,
It?s just a silver kangaroo.
It has a pleasing, soothing charm,
At nicht ?twill keep your hurdies warm.
Dong may ye live to toss and wear it,
It?s strong enough, sa dinna spare it,
Be it bed or couch you throw it on.
You may think at times on Uncle John.


EPITAPH TO A FRIEND.
Oct., 1894.
Dear Kate, your senses must have lied.
Why do you wish that you were dead r
Your race in life has scarce begun,
And soon, perhaps, it may be run.
Possessed ot all that wealth can give,
You?d fly from death and wish to live,
A few short years and you and I
Will land in the sweet by-and-bye :
A few more years and, while we rot,
By all on earth we'll be forgot.
What though you?re not of noble birth,
You?re better far with sense and worth.
Yon sigh for wealth, but are yon sure
You?d happier be than being poor ?
Necessity knows no conditions,
Oar lives are ruled by our positions.
When we appear upon this earth,
We?re not consulted as to birth ;
We are governed by laws firmly fixed.
Although to us they seem quite mixed.
Scarce time to gaze on earth and sky.
To look around us, then to die.
Life, we are told, is an empty bubble,
(An idiot?s tale) and full of trouble.
Still, cling to hope ; never despair,
Keep building castles in the air.
?Tis cowards only fly from life,
Who cannot face tne world?s strife.
Then since we?re here without our will
Our little span of life to fill,
Let?s grasp the pleasures earth can give.
And shun all pain while we do live.
To all this maxim doth apply,
Just as we live, so will we die.


LINES ON SENDING FOR A VOLUME OF
THE ?PAISLEY POETS? TO SCOTLAND.
Richmond, May 29th, 1894.
Dear Sir, would you confer a boon
On a native of your ancient town,
By sending soon straight ower the sea
Your ? Paisley Poets ? book to me ?
How you have gathered a? the scraps
(Some hundreds) frae the rhyming chaps,
With all their sad deaths you mention,
I?m sure it?s past my comprehension.
How it has paid I cannot tell ;
With all my heart I wish it well.
I see you?ve classed me with the ithers,
I hardly dare call them ray brithers.
My rhyming ware I?m loth to show it,
I?m sure I?ll never be a poet.
The heathery braes, the fairy nooks,
The hills, the g'ens, the running brooks,
The warbling songsters, humming bees,
With flowers and rocks and towering trees,
I?ve seen them a?, Lord knows how long,
And yet I canna mak? a song.
Sae I hae stuck to simple rhyme,
To please mysei? and pass the time.
I heard from Queensland of your book,
And so this liberty I took.
I dinna ken what is the price,
Whate?er it is I am not nice.
So forward it soon as you can,
I?ll pay you sme as I?m a man.
TO MR. PAYN.
I?m sorry, Payn, that you?re in pain,
And stretched upon your bed.
I hope you?ll cheat Old Nick again?
You?re far from being dead.


Now, if you would avoid great pain,
Stop nipping at the whisky ;
Your health and strength you might regain,
And feel quite strong and frisky.
But should you, Payn, this rule disdain,
Yon know the consequences,
For then again you?ll suffer pain,
Besides, you?ll lose your senses.
A little drink in a social way
Is what all wise men relish ;
When tempted and you can?t say nay,
Oft ends in something hellish.
TO A FRIEND (A SPIRITIST).
Dear Sir, our merry days are past,
Old age is creeping on us fast,
And some day soon creeps in the last?
Then comes repose ;
Then snug before misfortune?s blast
We end our woes.
When we review this mystic scene,
Of what?s to come and what has been,
We long to peep behind that screen
That parsons dare.
But, Sir, ?twould not be worth a preen?
There?s nothing there.
We have seen our share of threescore years,
We?ve had our joys, aye, and our tears.
And though I?ll never range through spheres
Of joys eternal,
I?ll leave this scene without the fears
Of pains infernal.


EPITAPH ON DAVID Me
Alas ! poor Mack has gone to dust,
In life so gay and frisky ;
He?d ne?er allow himself to rust
For want o? Usher?s whisky.
No more he'll rattle out the dice ?
He has thrown his last sad throw?
Or smack his lips ower something nice,
He?s gone where all must go.
Where his soul?s gone I cannot tell,
No more can Dr. Bevan ;
?Pis certain he has gone to H?ll,
He could not live in heaven.
EPITAPH ON WILLIAM L T.
Old William?s gone, God rest his soul,
The earth now claims his body ;
No man did better love his bowl,
His roast beef and his toddy.
In heaven if Bill has found a goal,
Which all who knew him wishes,
He?ll praises sing with heart and soul,
If there?s enough of dishes.
EPITAPH.
She is gone, she is gone, that I loved throughout
A kind, faithful being, a dutiful wife.
She taught us to succour and love one another,
I can never forget thee, my own dear mother.
And if thy pure spirit in bliss has its birth,
If not?you your duty did well on this earth,


EPITAPH.
Farewell, dear Liz, of sterling worth.
Tour loss will make us weep ;
A kinder heart ne'er beat on earth?
Rest in eternal sleep.
FRAGMENT.
To-day I have seen full threescore years,
In this little world of joys and tears ;
What has happened in life I pretty well know.
What will happen in future, or where I will go,
My whole life?s experience clearly hath shown,
That those two little secrets can never be known*
SONG?SATURDAY?S DRAM.
[lt is the custom of the working classes of Paisley
to meet in social parties on Saturday nights and enjoy
themselves over a dram. Total abstainers may de-
claim against this custom, but I have had many a
night?s real social enjoyment on a Saturday night, and
never felt the worse for it.]
The lang, weary week, wi 1 its toils and its troubles,
Ance mair, Guid be thankit, is noo at an enn? ;
Let the rich and the great revel deep in life?s bubbles.
We are happier far by our cosy fire?en.
The drunkard may drink till he?s fou as a piper,
The glutton may gorge till his belly he cram,
But we scorn a? excesses as we would a viper,
And relish in friendship our Saturday?s dram.


How joyous and cheery, though trudging home weary,
On Saturday nicht to the wifie and weans ;
The floor white and shining, nae signs o? repining,
As we fling in her apron our hard-earned gains.
The bawbees are biding, the frying-pan skirling.
That soon puts an end to our hunger or clam,
The weans in clean dresses, their hair a? in tresses,
And the auld folks quite canty ower Saturday?s
dram.
When the winter of life comes, and cares biting keenly
The Saturday?s dram maks us merry and leal ;
It scatters life?s black clouds, and then sae serenely,
In hearts soft and warm we wish a? bodies week
As snug roun? the fireside we sip our bit drappie,
Our cares and vexations may a? gae ram stara.
Then a' things around us seem gladsome and happy,
And we love a? the world and our Saturday?s dram.
The sad tale of woe when we hear it frae ithers
Then thrills through our hearts and our feelings
raair keen ;
We are ready just then to embrace them as hrithers
Nae miserly selfishness then can be seen.
Of balls, promenades, and sight-seeing I?m weary?
They?re empty an \ hollow?they?re nought but a
but a sham ;
There?s nothing on earth half sae lively and cheery,
As an hour wi? your freens ower a Saturday?s dram.
ANS WEE TO THE QUESTION.
Why I Would Not Deink.
You have asked the cause of not drinking
I will give you some reasons why,
The brutes who are not formed for thinking,
They only drink when they are dry.


My head now I feel is much clearer,
My heart, too, I feel is more light.
With good health, which to me is far dearer,
And my purse is increasing in weight.
'Should you wish to live long and be healthy,
Begin from your earliest youth.
And though you may never be wealthy,
You?ll have peace, honor, virtue and truth.
To the dogs pitch the cursed beer bottle,
From its fangs now declare yourself free,
And when you would moisten your throttle,
Always stick to a cup of good tea.
SONG?YARiIABERG FLAT (Local).
?Twas winter, and Yarraberg Flat
Was covered in mud and water,
When ae nicht the cadgers a? met,
Bent on social enjoyment and clatter?
There was singing, and fiddling, and fun,
And the joys that we mortals delight in ;
There was lashings o? whisky and rum,
Comic stories and wondrous reciting.
On the floor first stood Willie White,
Wi? his e?en looking up to the ceiling;
Young Norval he weel could recite,
With the greatest of passion and feeling.
Then up jumped the wee German laird,
And sang about fairies and witches,
That danced round his faither?s kail yard,
While his mither was mending his breeches.


Sodger Lilburn noo graspet his stump,,
Determined to tell a bit story?
How he made the black devils all jump,
When fighting for India?s glory ;
How he cuddled a blooming black wench.
How he lost his right flipper in battle,
How a dog ate it up in a trench
While the thundering cannon did rattle.
Next Martin ?a real funny chiel?
Declared he was tired o? his fiddle;
He maintained that auld ? Satan the de il ?
Was held up a? the people to diddle.
How on earth could a lass get a wean,
If she was of virtuous behaviour ;
Yet Mary while lying her lane
Wi? a dream she produced a great saviour*
Then there?s that silly tale about Eve,
How she damned all mankind wi? an apple,
Nane but poor, silly souls can believe,
Sic rubbish aye sticks in my thrapple.
For me I profess nae creed ;
Amang a? your kinds o? believing,
I don?t care a dam when I?m dead,
Sae lang?s I?m a? right when I?m leevin.
In a corner sat Johnny R 1,
As quiet as a mousey (but thinking) ;
He declared ?twould be best on the whole
To skedaddle and finish up drinking.
Then we wound up wi? ? Auld Lang Syne,?
As we grippet each band as a britber,
When old Sol was beginning to shine,
We toddled off hame a? thegither.


Now, oh what a change of the scene
Since we lived in wee tents bv the river ;
* W
No taxes, no Town Hall were seen,
And we thought this would lasted for ever.
But some have gone this way and that,
And some have grown wrinkled and hoary ;
There?s but few of us left on the Flat
Can remember the time of this story.
