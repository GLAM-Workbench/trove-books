PLAY THE GAME!
By WALTER A. GALE.
Australian kinsmen, list and hear
The battle’s rousing bugle-call,
The war-drum’s beat, the British cheer,
Where brothers fight or brothers fall.
For all we hope, for all we prize,
For all we love, for all we pray.
Brave Britons of the southern skies,
Our Empire calls “Enlist, to-day!”
In thought, we hear the booming guns,
The bursting bombs, the shrieking shells.
We feel the horrors of the Huns,
And choke with gases from their hells;
While brothers suffer what we feel,
The call to arms can we resist.
And, heedless, hear their hearts’ appeal,
“We need your help—Enlist! Enlist! V
Can we refuse to help our kin
Who fight while we stand idly by ?
And shall we lose what heroes win
Who proudly live or nobly die?
From Southern Cross each guardian star,
Throughout the peaceful Austral night,
Shines forth the answer from alar,
“Quit ye like men, Enlist and fight!
“Leave pelf to men too old to aid
Their country in her hour of need.
Leave gentle games to tender maid
Too frail for hero’s warlike deed.
Leave football to the beardless boys
Too young to make a deathless name.
Leave life’s poor toys, seek life’s stern Joys,
Fight the good fight, and Play the Game!
'The Argus,” June 1«, 1915.
