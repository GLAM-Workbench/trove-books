PREFACE.
I do not claim for the following Songs and Poems any merit
beyond that which attaches to them owing to the place where
they were written and the method of composition. The place
was a prison, and the majority were composed at night in the
darkness and silence of my cell. Pegasus, possessing wings, was
in a position to surmount the walls and carry my lyrical efforts
to a secure haven. Shelley says—
Some men are cradled into poetry by wrong,
They learn in suffering what they teach in song.
The poet prophesied truly, and if but one line of the many I
have penned brings aid to
A cause which lacks assistance,
A wrong that needs resistance,
I shall have my reward.
WALTER ROD WAY




The Haunted Cell.
[The Model Prison at Berrima has the reputation of possessing a haunted cell. In days long
gone by, when chains, ring-bolts, gags, and other instruments of torture, were in vogue,
’tis said a prisoner died therein through the harsh treatment of his gaolers. Be that as it
may, I have held intercourse with those who, having slept in that cell, were able to
describe to me certain strange matters which gave rise to the following Poem. Additional
interest may arise from the fact that it was written in the dark in my own cell at
Darlinghurst.]
IT seems the reflex of a dream,
Or vision wild and strange —
An echo from a world beyond
The pale of mental range.
Yet ’tis no dream of Fancy born,
Nor dark imagining,
No fleeting mirage of the mind
That from Sleep’s shades might spring.
I sing of chains that sear my soul,
Forged by no mortal hand,
Of ghostly shapes and phantoms pale
From out dim Spirit-Land.
They pierce my dreary Prison-house,
Through steel and stone they troop,
And throng my cell—a charnel, weird,
Unearthly, awful group.
A nameless dread, a spectral gloom,
On thought and feeling preys,
While on my damp and pallid brow
Death’s Hand for ever weighs.
A cloud of fear wraps all around,
A sense of something fell,
Thrills through my heart and chills my blood
Within this prison cell.
They say that in the days gone by,
When Might was ever Right,
A helpless captive here found death,
One dark and fearful night.
Not death which comes in common guise,
So silently and still,
But Death in Scarlet Murder’s garb,
The work of mortal will.


Here in this dungeon dark and drear,
All aid! ess and alone,
His life-blood laving these cold stones,
He breathed his dying moan.
Torn from the crushed and mangled clay,
The Spirit, startled, fled,
And shrieked to Heav’n the hellish wrong
Done to the murdered dead.
You see yon ring-bolt in the floor,
With red rust deeply stained
’Tis said the victim of cruel hate
To this was strongly chained.
When lonely moon-ray floods the flags
About the noon of night,
The voiceless iron tho’ cold and dumb,
Reflects a crimson light.
Dense clouds of fear wrap all around,
A sense of something fell
Thrills through my heart and chills my life
Within this prison cell.
The Death-watch ticks the hours along,
’Mid soul-appalling tones,
Unreal and yet too real—faint sounds
Like distant ghostly groans.
These ebb and flow till Morning Star
Disperses sable night,
And pearly Dawn steals in the haunt
Of guilt-avenging sprite.
Chains ring and clank across the floor,
When I no fetters see ;
They rouse me oft from troubled sleep,
And are no phantasy.
The inner-gate with massive bars,
Omnipotent as Fate,
Though fixed and locked slow opens wide
As hinges harshly grate.
One Awful Eye will fill the cell
With baleful angry gleams;
I see it now ! And shall again,
But never in my dreams.


The gentle mice ne’er visit me,
E’en spiders shun the place;
They know it’s haunted by a dead
And vengeful Spirit race.
I breathe within a living grave,
Unhallowed, under ban,
For blood-stained wrong—by hands of fiends
Hid ’neath the form of man.
Dense clouds of fear wrap all around,
A sense of something fell,
Thrills through my heart and chills all life,
Within this prison cell.
Grim horrors o’er me creep and crawl,
And freeze into my brain ;
They leave me but to reappear
When darkness comes again.
A dolor to the chamber clings
As ivy to the wall;
Deep tides of woe assail my ear,
And, moaning, rise and fall.
Yet nought is tangible or plain,
The phantoms come and go
Like ripples on a rushing stream,
Or shadows on the snow.
Their icy breath and spectral mist,
Enfold me in a shroud,
When near my head they silent float
And round my pillow crowd.
The birds ne’er chirp on casement sill,
They frightened wing their way
Across my dungeon’s window bars,
Nor single moment stay.
’Tis fearful in the midnight drear,
When horror clasps my soul,
To feel my cell is tenanted
By stern tyrannic ghoul.
I cannot flee—no help is nigh,
Chained, desolate, alone,
I shiver with cold pale affright \
Fear claims me for its own.


Oh ! for the hour, God send it soon,
When Death shall bring surcease
From this o’erwhelming weight of woe,
And drown the past in Peace!
A cloud of dread wraps all around,
A sense of something fell,
Thrills through my heart and chills my blood
Within this prison cell.
A Prison Flower.
A WITHERED rose, of beauty shorn,
And fragrance all despoiled,
With pallid tints and petal torn,
Its sweet life crushed and soiled ;
The thoughtless, scowling, captive band,
Unheeding, pass it by,
But with a tender loving hand
I lift the bud on high.
Only a prison flower,
Faded and broken,
Yet to my heart a dower
And treasured token.
It speaks to me of rippling streams,
Of happy joyous things,
Fills my sad hours with dulcet dreams,
And bright enchantment brings :
A message from the days of yore,
When free from galling chain,
My bark led on by Hope swept o’er
Youth’s fair unruffled main.
Only a prison flower,
Scentless and faded,
It makes my cell a bower
By Memory aided.


Like Holy Hose of Palestine,
"Which seeming dead and bare,
Within its heart contains a mine
Of perfumed beauty rare,
Awaiting but the touch of dew,
Or kiss of gentle rain,
To burst its bonds, its life renew
And blossom once again.
Thus my poor prison flower,
Lost and forsaken,
Still owns the magic power
Hope to awaken.
No More They Arms Entivine.
NO more thy arms entwine
Close as the vine,
Ho more thy sweet eyes shine
Love into mine:
Gone is the touch of thy gentle hand,
Vanished thy smiles like sea-swept sand.
Tears stud thy dainty face
Fading apace,
Heart throbs sad and forlorn
From dear heart torn :
Lost my Love like gems in a dream,
Lost like dew on a flowing stream.
Silvered thy golden hair,
Once wealth so rare,
Pallid thine eyes azure,
My jewels pure:
Weary and worn waiting for one,
Light of my heart, my life, my sun.
Time flies with rapid wing,
And soon will bring
Balm for thy present pain,
Borne not in vain :
Sighing shall burst into sweetest song,
Banishing tears, and woe, and wrong.


My Three Hngers.
When silver starlight streams o’er land and sea,
And sleep and silence reign the world between,
There come to me three angels noiselessly,
Illuming all around my cell’s dark scene.
The tuneful music of their voices sweet,
Breathed as one breath, like spray of summer bloom,
Breaks like a charm upon my heart’s dull beat,
And gives me peace for pain, and joy for gloom.
Their long lost forms gleam in the darkness drear
With leaping light, that melts my chains away;
On all a hopeful smile, on all a tear,
They change my blackest night to brightest day.
In sorrow sunk each night I long and listen,
Not vainly, for the cadence of their undertone;
Led on by Love, they swiftly glide and glisten
Through stone and steel to quell my heart’s mute moan.
One after one, they seek to still my grief
With visions of home-rest in coming time ;
Each leaves a loving kiss for my relief,
A gift renewed at every midnight chime.
Somebody’s Darling.
BRIGHTLY a moonbeam comes stealing
Through bars in a darksome cell,
Heaven’s pure light clear revealing
One under Death’s potent spell;
Prone lies the head that once proudly
Crested the world’s stormy stream,
Glazed are the eyes that once fondly
Answered Love’s gladdening gleam.
Somebody’s Darling is dying,
Unloved and alone,
None near to soothe his last sighing
Nor still his death moan.


Somebody far away waiting—
Is longing and .watching in vain,
For that fainting form fast hasting
World weary from Life’s final pain ;
Marble the face seems by moonlight
Unlit by the heart’s paling flame,
Still, in the midst of the death fight
Come murmurs of Somebody’s name.
Somebody’s Darling is dying,
Unloved and alone.
None near to sooth his last sighing
Nor still his death moan.
Tears drop from clouds swiftly trailing
Over the captive’s lone bier.
Only the night wind’s sad wailing
Falls on the listening ear.
********
Somebody’s Darling is dead now,
But free as a bird on the lea,
Touch with lips gently the pale brow,
For Somebody over the sea !
Somebody’s Darling is flying,
No longer alone,
To lands that know neither sighing
Nor pitiful moan.
Non and Then.
THE azure skies gleam bright as when
We watched the clouds—not long ago,
But 0 the change ’tween now and then
Although the waves still ebb and flow,
And still sweet flowers their fragrance fling
On velvet sward and shady dell,
Yet Love is lost like snow in Spring
Between us, Isobel


And still the bird’s clear melody
Wafts on the air as in the past,
But dead is our heart’s harmony,
And severed is the chain at last ;
No more the plumaged songster’s note
Trills forth the name I loved too well,
Wide spheres of sea moan as they float
Between us, Isobel.
And still the stars look down and smile,
And sunbeams gladden all the land,
As when my Love knew not exile,
And we two wandered hand-in-hand ;
But never more by wood or sea
We meet again—lost is the spell
That filled the hours with euphony,
Between us, Isobel.
Dreams of Starlight.
DREAMS of sunlight, dreams of starlight,
Sweet refrains of music dear,
Songs forgotten in the world-fight,
Charm me in my dungeon drear ;
Oft-times when in gloom and sadness
Weary with life’s toil and pain,
Come bright gleams of former gladness
When my cup was free from bane.
Faint fragments of a smiling past,
Soft echoes of the May-bell’s chime,
When blithesome, fair, my lot was cast
’Mid perfumed gales of Eastern clime ;
Dim lines of ancient sages’ lore,
The semblance of a long-lost form,
While into space I pensive soar
Away from woe and chilling storm.


At times the scent of tropic flowers
Bursts on my senses all around,
Steals through my cell in midnight hours,
And leaves me with nepenthe crowned ;
A word, a thought, these pleasures bring,
They come, they go, as swift as light
On Memory’s quick revolving wing,
A boundless store of pure delight.
Seeing is Believing.
I saw throughout a model gaol
Scene after scene of freedom ;
The chains are silk, steel bars no cage,
And captives never heed ’em;
Roast, boiled, or baked you dine upon,
Souchong your thirst relieving,
Lounge through the day, smoke through the night—
And seeing is believing !
No tiresome bills, no patient duns,
To make you pay the piper,
You’re clothed and fed like any lord,
And labour is a cipher;
An ounce of weed will get that done,
By some poor hind who’s grieving—
Not for his sins, but want of smoke—
And seeing is believing !
By strangest, wildest paradox,
The best and largest dinner
Is given him who has most time,
And is the greatest sinner;
But, sneer at Police, or pluck a rose,
Come here quite free from thieving,
You’re starved and cursed and knocked about —
And seeing is believing !


Burst bank, garotte, know homicide,
They’ll treat you like a brother ;
Rape girls, or forge, stab, rob, then slay,
Each turnkey is a mother ;
Filch but a loaf to save your life,
Your breast with sorrow heaving,
You have to live by crusts alone—
And seeing is believing !
Bring five years’ penal servitude,
And prove yourself a felon,
A scoundrel, dastard without doubt,
You’ll feed on lamb and melon ;
Wear wool to keep the damp away,
Its warmth all chill relieving,
Slouch round the gaol in slippered feet—
And seeing is believing !
All night by light of pocket lamp
You scan the daily papers,
Cut cards, shake dice, dance novel jigs,
And other kinds of capers ;
O’er prison rules and prison “ screws ”
A victory achieving,
Laugh at the law, scoff, curse or sing—
And seeing is believing !
What wonder that our gaols are full,
Sometimes to overflowing,
When Fortune pours her favours down
On evil wild-oat sowing;
An honest man may starve in rags,
Because he’s not deceiving ;
But convicts must have tender care—
And seeing is believing !
The chances are that once you taste
The fruits of penal sentence,
You’ll bite again, and then again,
Nor ever feel repentance;
Go search the records of our gaols,
They prove that constant thieving
Is deemed the best of policy—
And seeing is believing !


A may come back again.
WHEN little babies are not birched,
When beer is fit to drink,
When every wife is really churched,
When juries wisely think,
When squatting does not make the man,
When “ forties ” all abstain,
When Sydney has no courtesan
I may come back again.
When Judges give just sentences,
When bobbies cease to lie,
When “ she-oak ” good old sherry is,
And Blue Saints never sigh,
When Darlinghurst has work to do,
And girls are never vain,
When Queensland rum is worth a sou
I may come back again.
When Law and Justice both unite,
And Hordern Brothers “ bust,”
When Parkes and Davies fiercely fight,
And old iron has no rust,
When Palmer Street is wholly pure,
And Gladesville getting sane,
When Milner Stephen has a cure,
I may come back again.
When pubs, are open up to twelve,
And dogs forget to bark,
When Parsons wish to dig and delve,
And Bishops have a lark,
When Town Hall clocks keep proper time,
And Virtue’s without stain,
When native bears forget to climb,
I may come back again.
When streets are free from slaughter-cars,
And black gins modest look,
When England has no jolly tars,
And Thompson makes no “ book,”
When Traill forgets to write a jest,
And Ireland to complain,
When I by Blue Saints have been bless’d
I may come back again.


She temple of Wrong.
[In the following poem—which might fitly be called “The Cry of the Children,” — I raise
my voice on behalf of those who are too helpless to aid themselves. I have seen wee bits
of humanity, undergoing sentences of imprisonment, who should have been in a nursery
instead of a gaol. On one occasion, two little boys, hatless, tearful, and in tatters, entered
the place with a magisterial blessing of three days or a week—I forget which—the
smallest of whom was absolutely unable to put on his shoes or button his jacket, his age, I
should say, being three years, or four at the outside. Every morning the elder brother,
a young gentleman who perhaps had seen six summers, was compelled to take the part of
Master of the Eobes and attire the younger one in his apparel.]
IN’ a fair Southern Province —you know it too well—
The foam of Pacific among,
’Midst sunlight, wave ripple, and asphodel,
To the pealing and clashing of steeple bell,
Was built up a Temple to Wrong !
The sacrifice deemed for this Deity meet,
Made from Morn-star till Even-song,
By a mandate of priesthood on Mercy-seat,
Was the patter, all chained, of infant feet
Flecked with blood by the throne of Wrong !
The sobbing and sighing of children in pain
Rose as incense the whole day long,
’Neath the high-fretted roof of this Avatar’s fane,
Where oblations were poured of tears of the slain
At the feet of throned rampant Wrong !
Tears of babes that fell from their dim eyes in vain,
’Mid smiles from the idolist throng,
Who sought in their madness their ends to attain
By placing the young of the land under bane
Of the soul-searing spirit of Wrong !
A priest of the altar, malignant in ill,
Wields wildly and swiftly a thong ;
With moans of the victims the temple they fill
Ere in fetters they mould them to the stern will
Of the horrible deity—Wrong !
Through that portal to pain a ceaseless tide rolls,
To the music of brazen gong,
Of succourless, fainting, sad, infantine souls,
O’er whose death in life’s dawn dance sin-laden ghouls
Who people the Temple of Wrong !
