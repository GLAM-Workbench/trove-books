THE
C. W. A. Colect
K EEP us, O Lord, from 'pettiness; let us he large in thought,
in word and deed.
Let us he done with fault-finding and leave off self-seeking.
May we put away all pretence and meet each other face to face,
without self-pity and without prejudice.
May we never he hasty in judgment, and always generous.
Teach us to put into action our better impulses, straightforward
and unafraid.
Let us take time for all things; make us grow calm, serene,
gentle.
Grant that we may realize that it is the little things that create
differences; that in the hig things of life we are one.
And may we strive to touch and know the great woman’s
heart common to us all; and O Lord God, let us not
forget to he kind.

FROM THE LADY SOMERS
Dear Members,
I feel very honoured to have been asked to send a message
on this great occasion.
The inaugural meeting of the C.W.A. still remains vividly
in my mind —after all these years —as lam sure it does in the
minds of all those who were present. What a great venture it
was, that was undertaken with such vision by those very able and
enthusiastic members of your original Committee!
Even in the first year, however, success was assured and
what a pleasure it was “on Tour” to find new branches springing
up everywhere, whether near Melbourne, around Mildura, in
the Mallee, near Shepparton, or in Gippsland or
Now I read of your 525 branches and 99 Younger Sets and send
you this message of congratulation for the past and good wishes
for the future.
A copy of Country Crafts has very kindly been sent me
by your Headquarters, which I have never missed reading, except
for a few copies which lost their way during the war, so I have fol-
lowed your local progress and widening influence with admiration
and your help to Britain with gratitude. It seems a moment to
repeat how much your gifts of clothing and food have been
appreciated here and the warmth of feeling which they have
kindled. Those who helped to unpack and distribute, as well
as those who received the gifts, were thrilled by the lovely
materials and the workmanship which had been used in making
the quilts, clothes and woollies and also at the care taken in the
packing of the parcels. There was a psychological tonic in
handling those beautifully made things at that time and it still
helps to find such care and skill being lavished on gifts for others.
Good luck and many happy returns from an old friend and
admirer.
Your one-time Patroness and now President of the
Eastnor Women’s Institute.

FROM HER EXCELLENCY, MRS. W. J. McKELL
It makes me very happy to congratulate the Country
Women’s Association of Victoria on twenty-one mdmorable
years.
Those years have been ones of outstanding progress, and the
constantly increasing membership is a tribute to the interest
which the activities of the Association have aroused in country
women, and in a great many others who have a sympathetic
desire to associate themselves with its aims and ideals.
The Association has performed splendid service based on
truly Christian principles—it has brought together women from
distant and isolated places, given them an opportunity to voice
their most urgent needs, and by a unity of purpose, accomplished
much.
It has given lonely country women a sense of “belonging”
and kinship. It has brought to them an understanding of their
own problems which are so often the problems of others, too,
and shown them how they can help themselves and each other.
The Country Women’s Association of Victoria can look
back on the achievements of the past twenty-one years with
justifiable pride, and I am convinced, in the light of what has
been accomplished, and with the great possibilities which lie
ahead, the Association will continue to grow in power and
strength in its great service to the women of the country districts.
Patroness-in-Chief.

FROM THE LADY DUGAN
I am very happy indeed to have this opportunity of express-
ing my admiration of the work of the Country Women’s Associa-
tion. I have met many thousands of its members, not only here,
in my own State of Victoria, but also in South Australia as well
as in other parts of the Commonwealth, and I have never ceased
to admire the wonderful work they are doing for the benefit
of those who live in the far distant localities.
The activities of the Country Women’s Association cover
such a wide and varied field that it would be impossible in a short
message to mention them all. I would, however, like to refer
particularly to the Handicrafts and I am more than glad to know
that the mobile unit which was used to take amenities to the Land
Army girls during the war, has, since I presented it to the Country
Women’s Association, become the Home Science Van, and has
gone on to even greater work, travelling into the heart of the
outback, giving those privileges and advantages which would
otherwise be denied to dwellers on isolated farms.
As I am leaving for England very shortly I want to express
my gratitude to all members of the C.W.A. for the many happy
hours I have spent in their midst, and my best wishes go to each
member for the future. I shall never forget the generosity of
country women in their efforts to help England in her time of
need.
The work of this Association is indeed a practical demon-
stration of all that is best in life, including unselfish labour in the
cause of comradeship, State and Empire, and I am proud and
happy to have been associated with the C.W.A. whose ideals
are based upon those principles which include Honour to God,
Loyalty to the Throne and Empire, and Love of Service.
Patroness.

FROM LADY HERRING
Heartiest congratulations to the Country Women’s Associa-
tion of Victoria on the attainment of its majority and for all it
has achieved during the past 21 years.
It was indeed a fortunate day for our Country Women —
in fact, for the whole community—when the Lady Somers
convened the inaugural meeting in 1928.
For the C.W.A. has not only rendered splendid service to
the country women of Victoria, but it has also helped city dwellers
to appreciate the problems of their sisters in the country and to
realize, in some degree at least, what can be achieved in the face
of great difficulties, by courage and endurance.
The Country Women’s Association has become a power for
good in this land. I know its work and splendid influence will
continue to increase, and carry into more and more homes the
great ideals for which it stands.

LADY MITCHELL, C.B.E.
First State President 1928-29-20-31-32


LADY MITCHELL, c.b.e.
Our founder and first State President has gone to her well-earned rest; her life
was given to good works for the cause of humanity.
She was the daughter of Dr. Morrison, the first Headmaster of Scotch College,
and her husband, Sir Edward Mitchell, k.c.m.g., was for many years Leader of the
Victorian Bar. Of their four daughters the eldest, Mrs. Armit, of Bindi, was a
Group President of the C.W.A., her second daughter, Mary, was Secretary of the
Victorian Junior Red Cross and author of Warning to Wantons and other books,
the third is Mrs. George Adams and the youngest, Janet, has had a brilliant
academic career.
In 1915 she was working in the H.Q. of the Australian Red Cross in London;
when the Australian V.A. Detachment was formed, she was its Commandant, and
in 1918 was justly awarded the c.b.e. for her splendid services.
On returning to Australia in 1919, she was active in organizing the “Society
of Overseas Settlement for British Women” in Victoria.
Her flair for organizing was outstanding and she was associated with many
philanthropic schemes which included the Bush Nursing Hospitals.
Early in 1928 the Lady Somers, wife of the State Governor, asked her aid in
staiting the Country Women s Association in Victoria, and she became the first
State President, holding that position for two years and again later for a further
term. Her wise counsel helped the Association over many a stony path in the early
years, and her vision and ideals were an inspiration to all who knew and worked
with her.
We have had some splendid Presidents, but none, I think, who so ably carried
out or upheld the ideals for which she built.
How greatly country women have benefited through this leaven of service
and friendship which she engendered is well known.
She realized the big part women would be called upon to play and the great
responsibilities to be shouldered by them before the world attained the Universal
Peace for which it is striving to-day.


WE GROW UP
r I ' HIS book commemorates the 21st anniversary of the Country Women’s
Association of Victoria, and records the manner in which, like a great
tapestry, it has been wrought into the fabric of country life in this State.
The daily round of the average country woman could, in so many cases,
be likened to a bare canvas, with but empty spaces between the crossed threads
of house work and farm work. Now the pattern of the Country Women’s Associ-
ation has filled those spaces with a bold and varied design.
The branch meetings are more than a welcome social gathering, for they
provide food for thought and practical help to home makers and craft workers,
as well as an outlet for talent with their choral and dramatic competitions. Even
more than all this, the Association, by virtue of its size (28,000 members, 530
branches and 95 Younger Sets) gives the country woman, no matter how remote
her home, the right and the responsibility of working to improve conditions for
women and children.
She has her motto:
“Honour to God,
Loyalty to the Throne and Empire,
Service to the country,
Through Country women,
For Country women,
By Country women ”
and she has capable leaders to help her to live up to it. Incidentally, no account
of our Country Women’s Association would be really complete without a
tribute to what might be called the C.W.A. husbands, a band of patient, frequent-
ly bored, but kindly men, who must have driven their wives innumerable miles to
meetings, and listened to hours of C.W.A. chatter. To them our grateful thanks!
Now to tell our tale in chronological order, we have to go back to 1926
when many new settlers were striving to adjust themselves to what seemed to
them to be strangely lonely lives. Inspired largely by Miss Elsa Grice, the Vic-
toria League’s Development Committee inaugurated a limited, but very definite
design for country women by forming its first Women’s Institute at Macedon in
February 1926. By April 1928 there were 8 Institutes, which were run on the
lines of the English Women’s Institutes, craft work was taught, lectures given,
and home industries encouraged. Their work aroused much interest throughout
the country, and still has a strong influence on our Country Women’s Association,
for 7 of these Institutes joined the Association, their Committee was co-opted
and still works with vigour and enterprise as the Handicrafts and Home Indus-
tries Committee of the Country Women’s Association.
In 1927 the late Sir Charles Merrett, President of the Royal Agricultural
Society and Chairman of the New Settlers League of Victoria invited several
c
5


representative men and women to meet Lady Somers (wife of the Governor of
Victoria) to discuss matters of rural welfare.
After discussion, Mrs. O. A. Hicken moved that action be taken. An
Advisory Committee, of which Lady Mitchell was the convenor, was appointed
to ascertain whether the formation of a Country Women’s Association was de-
sirable.
The idea was welcomed by the Bush Nursing Association and other wel-
fare bodies, and so the bold design, with which we are familiar, was first
planned in a letter written by Lady Somers calling an open conference. Here
is a quotation: “We all realize the vital importance to the State, as to the whole
Commonwealth, of arresting the drift from the country to the cities. We
know, too, that in many districts, under present conditions, such a tendency is
not surprising, and that, if we wish to counteract it, no effort must be spared
to brighten country life and to ensure prosperous rural communities.
“Much has already been done in this direction by many of the excellent
existing organizations, but it would seem that, in the opinion of many thinking
people, there is still the need for a State-wide organized body of country
women, untrammelled by political or sectarian obligations, whose object would
be to support and strengthen, for each other’s benefit and for the common
good, the work of all useful activities already in being, and to act as a
Council of Women, able, as a corporate body, to speak with authority on, and
to command attention to, matters of public interest connected with country
affairs.”
* * * *
The Open Conference was duly held on March 12th, 1928, and presided
over by Lady Somers. Among those who spoke were Mr. H. W. Gepp (now
Sir Herbert) for the Commonwealth Government and the Development and
Migration Commission, Sir James Barrett for the Bush Nursing Association
and Dr. Vera Scantlebury as Director of Infant Welfare. Mrs. Hicken spoke
on behalf of settlers in her district, Mrs. Oswald Syme in support of the
Women’s Institutes, and Miss Fitzpatrick, Organizing Secretary of the Country
Women’s Association of New South Wales described in detail the work in that
State and answered questions. Lady Mitchell moved “That it is desirable to
proceed with the formation of a Country Women’s iVssociation of Victoria.”
Mrs. lan Black, of Noorat, seconded the resolution, which was carried by an
overwhelming majority, only seven voting against it.
Now, to follow our simile of a tapestry, came the work of filling in the
bare outline put forward in Lady Somers’ letter, the choosing of the colours,
and the threads to be used, which points to stress, and so on. The decision of
the seven Women’s Institutes to join the Association gave a very definite
twist to the design, by emphasizing craft work and home industries, thereby
making a most sensible and practical basis for planning branch programmes.


A Provisional Committee was set up, Lady Mitchell acting as Chairman,
Mrs. lan Wark as Honorary Secretary and Lady Masson as Honorary Trea-
surer with the following members: Mesdames Hicken and Kerr-Paterson and
the Misses A. A. Knight and B. A. Armstrong; Mrs. Oswald Syme was
invited to join this Committee, which met every fortnight. At the second
meeting the following donations were received: Mrs. Otway Falkiner, 5 gns.j
Mrs. Hicken, 3 gns.; and Mrs. F. Bird, Lady Mitchell, Lady Masson and
Mrs. Hawthorne, each 1 gn., and so began our bank balance.
The office-bearers and Executive were elected at a meeting presided over
by Lady Somers on June 19th, 1928. Lady Mitchell was elected President on
the proposal of Lady Creswell, seconded by Dr. Ethel Osborne; Mrs. lan
Black (Noorat), Mrs. L. Lansell (Bendigo), Mrs. A. Gerrand (Sale), Mrs.
lan Currie (Euroa), Mrs. Hawthorne (Kerang), were elected Vice-Presi-
dents. The Executive Committee were as follows: Mrs. Douglas Bruce
(Cranbourne), Mrs. O. A. Hicken (Shepparton), Mrs. Kerr-Paterson (Koo-
Wee-Rup), Mrs. R. G. Beggs (Beaufort), Mrs. Oswald Syme (Macedon)
and Miss E. Grice. Lady Somers proposed Mrs. lan Wark as Honorary
Secretary and Lady Masson as Honorary Treasurer, the resolution being
seconded by Mrs. Turner Shaw. Thus a group of women of varied ideas and
tastes was banded together to work for country women, to whom they gave
most unselfish service. The following is a brief and possibly incomplete record
of their work:
* * * *
Mrs. lan Wark held her office till May, 1929. Lady Masson, Assistant
Treasurer 1928-30; 1931-2; member Women’s Institute Committee, then
Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee. Mrs. lan Black, Vice-President
1928; Branch President, Terang, 1930-1; Country Vice-President, 1931-2.
Mrs. L. Lansell, Country Vice-President 1928-9. Mrs. A. Gerrand, Country
Vice-President 1928-9; first President Sale, formed Aug., 1928; Group Presi-
dent, 1933-4. Mrs. G. Hawthorne, Country Vice-President 1928-9; Represen-
tative C.W.A. at International Conference of Rural Women’s Organization,
London, April, 1929. Mrs. Bruce, nom. by branches 1928-9; first President
Cranbourne, still President 1931-2; Secretary 1933-4. Mrs. Kerr-Paterson, nom.
by Executive 1928-9; first President, Koo-Wee-Rup, formed March, 1929;
Country Vice-President 1931-2; Dist. Vice-President 1932-3. Mrs. lan Currie,
Country Vice-President 1928-9; President, Euroa, 1931. Mrs. Oswald Syme,
nom. by branches 1928-9; Assist. Treas. 1930-1; Country Vice-President
1931-2; chair, Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee, 1932-3; 1935-6
member Handicrafts and Home Industtries Committee.
The first Executive was held in June, 1928, when Miss Barlow was
engaged as office clerk and it was decided to rent a room in the State Savings
Bank Building. The following month Mr. E. R. Russell, General Manager


of the Bank of N.S.W., consented to act as Honorary Treasurer, a position he
held until 1945. During this time he gave much wise counsel on financial
matters. Realizing the urgent need for organizing in the country, Mrs.
Murray Waller (who had worked for the New Settlers League) was engaged
as Organizing Secretary, but did not come out from England to take up her
work till early in the next year.
At that time the bank balance was very small and money was urgently
needed. The seven Women’s Institutes decided to join the Association and
brought with them the sum of £350 (£3OO from the Wilson Trust and £SO
from Miss Grice), the interest from which made a nucleus for the Handicrafts
and Home Industries Committee’s fund. Prior to this the Honorary Secretary
of the Women’s Institutes, Miss Jessie Bage, had been asked to join the
Executive with her Assistant Secretary, Mrs. Morton, to act as her proxy. Many
efforts were made to find a shorter name for the former Women’s Institute
Committee, but to this day it remains the Handicrafts and Home Industries
Committee, the full tale of whose activities is told elsewhere.
It is noted in the minutes of the August Executive, 1928, that the Rest
Room in Terang was opened on July 30th, Macedon and Beaufort both had
Rest Rooms when they joined the Association; possibly Terang was the first
to be opened after the formation of the Association, now there are 72.
That same month the Executive gained a most able member when Mrs.
(now Lady) Sewell was asked to join as Publicity Officer. Ever since that day
her clear brain and nice sense of justice have solved many problems. She was
a Metropolitan President in 1930-1, 1931-2, Group President 1933-4, 1934-5,
State Vice-President 1935-7, Chairman H. & H.I. Committee 1937-40,
Honorary Secretary H. & H.I. Committee 1940-6, Editor of Country Crafts
from 1944. In addition to this she is still a member of Executive and serves on
the Agenda, Scholarship and other Committees.
A monthly Newsletter started as a link between branches and Headquarters,
was prepared first by Lady Masson, then by Mrs. Creswick. This was
the precursor of the magazine Country Crafts , an account of which is
included in the record of the Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee.
The badge, which is now so well known, was designed by Mrs. A. P.
Derham, who won a competition run by the Handicrafts and Home Industries
Committee with a view to finding a suitable design.


MRS. R. G. BEGGS
State President 1932-33-
MRS. J. S. FRASER, O.B.E.
State President 1930-31


MRS. J. S. FRASER, o.b.e.
Jessie Eiaser (nee Currie) was an Australian who went, on her marriage, to
India, only returning to live in Australia after the death of her husband.
After and during World War I, she took a great interest in the blinded soldiers
and the work for them and the administration of relief funds was left largely in
her hands by the Minister of Defence so that, as long as she lived, the blinded
soldiers biought all their troubles to her; she helped them with her common sense,
her friendliness, her time, and very often her money.
She was persuaded to join the C.W.A. and became the first President of the
first Metropolitan Branch, the Yarra Branch.
Mrs. Fraser began the search for a suitable Seaside Holiday Home for the new
C.W.A. and found Somers House. The Yarra Branch Younger Set, our first
Younger Set, raised the money for the deposit. Before her death Mrs. Fraser built
the new wing of Somers House including dining-room and sitting-rooms.
She was the second President of the Association and later on Honorary Organizer,
going round the country organizing new branches. She had a very sweet and
charming personality and was always a peacemaker.
MRS. R. G. BEGGS
Mrs. R. G. Beggs gave wonderful service to the C.W.A. during the three
stienuous years she was State President. These, being drought and depression
years, made her term of office more arduous.
Born in Queensland and brought up in the country, she was a keen gardener
and lover of all things associated with country life. Mrs. Beggs possessed a con-
side* able knowledge of trees and did much to foster treeplanting throughout the
country.
Herself a highly skilled cook and housewife, she was quick to understand the
terrible difficulties under which so many country women worked. Her chief endeavour,
therefore, was to brighten their daily lives by State-wide practical demonstrations
of domestic economy and such constructive crafts as glove-making, patchwork quilts,
and wool mattress making. She also compiled a “Birthday Cookery Book” which
brought £45 to general funds.
Mrs. Beggs had a sound knowledge of the work of the C.W.A., having been
a foundation member when a Women’s Institute was formed in Beaufort in & 1926,
for which she held the office of Branch President from 1928 until 1932, when she
became State President of the C.W.A,


Finance was still a source of considerable anxiety, and the office was
moved to 60 Market Street, where the rent was only £6O a year. A Polo
Week Ball in March, 1929, realized £450, which relieved the anxiety tem-
porarily.
We now come to the first Annual Meeting and Conference held on April
30th and May Ist, 1929. Compared to 1948, there was a noticeable brevity
in the report of the Conference, at which six of the eight resolutions brought
forward for discussion were carried! In the Honorary Secretary’s Report, Mrs.
Wark records the formation of 20 branches (including the seven former
Women’s Institutes) with a total membership of just on 1,700; 832 letters had
been received and 1,550 despatched. There had been a Christmas distribution
of toys to outback children under the direction of Mrs. Holman; 2,300
mothers and children received Christmas parcels; gifts were also sent to 13
Bush Nursing Hospitals for mothers with new babies. The cost of this was
defrayed by a special appeal, not from general funds.
The first Annual Balance Sheet shows donations amounting to £531/7/11.
The Honorary Treasurer, Mr. E. R. Russell, comments on this as follows:
“The Association has been most fortunate in getting such an excellent start due
to the generosity of such supporters of the movement as Mr. Oswald Syme
and Mr. A. T. Creswick, who each gave £lOO, and the H. V. McKay fund,
which gave £200.” i
In her report, Mrs. J. S. Fraser, the chairman of the Yarra Branch, gives
as its three main objectives:
1. To stock and replenish a Comforts Cupboard;
2. To acquire a Holiday Home by the Sea;
3. To carry out the distribution of Christmas Gifts on lines similar
to that of Christmas, 1928.
Miss K. Mackenzie and Mrs. lan Wark were joint Secretaries of the Yarra
Branch; Miss Mackenzie was an indefatigable worker in all good causes,
especially the Mallee Relief, and later was an Honorary Welfare Officer.
Mrs. Wark, who had done so much valuable work in the early days resigned
to continue her scientific work in May that year. The Report of the Yarra
Branch Younger Set was made by its President, Mrs. Norman Barrett, who
stated that they had already raised £5O towards the purchase of the Holiday
Home. What a wonderful record of kindly practical help for country women
by their town sisters was foreshadowed in those two reports! The Metropoli-
tan branches now number eleven; their members, in addition to many other
activities, such as hospital visiting, provide staffs for the Handicraft Exhibitions
and cater for the big annual meetings and conferences. The Handicrafts and
Home Industries Committee could not hold the Exhibitions without their
willing help, because its members are mostly experts in different crafts and
all are busy women.

There had been several changes in the Executive since March, 1928;
Mrs. W. E. Sargood was now a Country Vice-President and Mrs. J. S. Fraser
a Metropolitan Vice-President; Mrs. Gorman (Corowa), Mrs. Nankervis
(Bendigo) and Mrs. White (Beaufort) were nominated by branches, and Mrs.
Lionel Weatherley (Mortlake) and Mrs. S. J. Staughton (Associate Member)
were nominated by Executive. Mrs. Weatherley was President of the Mortlake
Branch till 1932, and a Group President 1933-5, 1937-8, and a member of
the Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee from 1938.
That first Annual Report closed with this quotation from Seneca:
“He that Uveth not somewhat to others ,
Liveth little to himself ”
Organizing in the country started in earnest in 1929, when Mrs. Murray
Waller arrived from England to take up her position as Organizing Secretary,
a position for which she was well suited. She was a good speaker, and on a long
and fatiguing tour, during which she camped out and spoke at one or two
meetings each day, she still varied her talk to suit the feeling of each gathering.
Her ready wit and quick sympathy made her many friends.
That winter Lady Mitchell and Mrs. Waller visited the Mallee, going to
Mildura, Yaramba, Werrimull, Werrimull South and Meringur, returning by
Donald, St. Arnaud and Dookie. Travelling in the Mallee in those days was
not easy and the branches were appreciative of the effort Lady Mitchell made
to visit them.
* * * *
To facilitate administration, a move was made at this time towards the
present Group System, when it was resolved “That Branch Groups shall hold
periodical social gatherings.”
A most important event that year was the purchase of Somers House at
Black Rock as a seaside home for country women at the cost of £2,480. (A
full account of Somers House appears elsewhere.)
The Association was represented at the first Rural Women’s Conference
in London in 1929 by Mrs. Fairfax, of N.S.W., and Mrs. Hawthorne
(Kerang) and Mrs. H. F. Creswick, of Melbourne, who was a Metropolitan
Vice-President 1930-2. Mrs. Creswick brought back a most interesting report
of the Conference.
The Mallee was in the grip of a disastrous drought at this time. A Parlia-
mentary Committee started a public appeal to give the women and children of
the Mallee a seaside holiday; over £4,000 was raised. The Association offered
to assist the scheme and Mrs. Waller was lent as Honorary Organizer for the
Committee. It was a large undertaking, over 1,000 women and children being
brought down to Melbourne. For many it was their first sight of the sea. In
addition to a very happy holiday, medical and dental attention was arranged
for 300 of the visitors.


The Mallee Relief Fund arose out of a C.W.A. appeal for bedding and
clothing for the Mallee Settlers, the Argus launched a public appeal, and to
this was added a large sum already collected by the Association, which was in
sole charge of the distribution of goods, the State Relief Committee helping
with their collection. £730 was spent on bedding and clothes. The Appeal
lasted two months, and over 700 sacks of clothing and 62 tons of vegetables
were distributed through the branches.
Lady Mitchell’s first term as State President ended in 1930 and she was
succeeded by Mrs. J. S. Fraser, during whose term branches were first formed
into Groups, each Group being represented on the Executive by its Group
President (formerly each branch was represented by its President). The first
Group Presidents were: Mrs. Amos (Manangatang), Mrs. Armit (Bindi), Mrs.
Buxton (Alexandra), Mrs. Bond (Nhill), Mrs. Campbell (Birregurra), Mrs.
Caddy (Tylden), Mrs. Hunter (Seymour), Mrs. Hicken, j.p. (Shepparton),
Mrs. Ingram (Donald), Mrs. Larking (Flinders), Miss Lewis (Beaufort),
Mrs. Mactier (Metcalfe), Mrs. Peart (Boort), Mrs. Kerr-Paterson (Dan-
denong), Mrs. Sargood, j.p. (Corowa), Mrs. Sims (Orbost), Mrs. Wilson
(Foster), Mrs. Weatherley (Mortlakc).
Other innovations were the Resolution Committee (later renamed
Agenda) and the Finance Committee, on which Lady Masson was succeeded
by Mrs. Oswald Syme, as Honorary Assistant Treasurer, who held that office
till 1931, when she became chairman of the Handicrafts and Home Industries
Committee.
* * * *
At first the Association’s only income was the quota from branches (half
the members’ subscription of 4/- a year), donations, and a grant from the New
Settlers League j this was originally £250, then £2OO, then £62/10/-
in 1931, when it ceased. In 1930 a Golf Gymkhana at the Commonwealth
Links realized £416 for Somers House and the Comforts Cupboard; the Yarra
Branch Younger Set raised £196 for Somers House with a successful Revue,
and a Cabaret Ball in Show Week brought £220 for general funds. By 1933
branches were holding Annual Country Week efforts, half the proceeds of
which went to Headquarters and the other half went to the branch; from
this Headquarters received £169 in 1933; by 1935 it realized £486 and was
renamed the Annual Effort. Headquarters’ share was then divided as follows:
40% to Somers House, 10% to the Handicrafts and Home Industries Com-
mittee and 50% to Headquarters. This Annual Effort is now the main source
of income for the Association; 50% goes to the Handicrafts and Home
Industries Committee, 25% each to Somers House and Headquarters—last
year it amounted to £1,700.
Mrs. Fraser and Mrs. Waller made a tour of the Mallee, camping part
of the time in a small motor truck. They visited Mildura, Benetook, Yaramba,
Merrinee, Bambill, Werrimull, Meringur, Kulwin, Annuello, Walpeup,


Manangatang, Chinkapook, Patchewollock. Mrs. Fraser addressed 25 meetings
in 14 days while travelling over 1,000 miles of very rough country! Lady
Mitchell became President again in 1931 and Mrs. Fraser continued to do a
great deal of travelling, this time as Honorary Organizer, as Mrs. Waller
resigned early in 1932.
By 1932 56 branches were running Market Stalls at their meetings, thereby
providing either a welcome source of pocket money, or an easy way in which a
member could pay her subscription, or make a donation in kind to branch funds.
The branch takes 2d. in the 1/- commission on each transaction. All manner of
things are sold garden produce, eggs, work, etc. Some enterprising branches
keep a slate where members write what they wish to buy or sell at the following
meeting.
Mrs. R. G. Beggs followed Mrs. J. S. Fraser as President in 1932 and
Miss E. Brett was appointed Honorary Welfare Officer; later she was suc-
ceeded by Miss Kate Mackenzie. Mrs. Beggs, Mrs. Peart of Charlton, Miss
Brett and Miss Russell visited the Mallee. Mrs. Beggs and Mrs. Peart stayed
with members while Miss Brett and Miss Russell slept in the car, spending
their first night peacefully unaware that they were just beside the Werrimull
morgue! Mildura, Meringur, Werrimull, Merrinee and Walpeup were visited.
The Mallee Trust Fund (the unexpended portion of the Mallee Holiday
Fund) was wound up that year, £250 being granted to the Association, of
which £IBO was earmarked for demonstrations and lectures to branches and to
pay delegates’ expenses, and £SO to assist welfare work, not necessarily for
members.
In August the office was moved to its present quarters and Miss Harland
was appointed General Secretary, a position she held until 1944.
It was decided that the Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee
should have its own constitution and this was duly drawn up by Mrs. Oswald
Syme with the Honorary Solicitor, Mr. Harold Templeton, and was later
adopted by the Executive. Mr. Harold Templeton was a very good friend to
the Association till his death in 1941; always willing to listen to its problems,
his wise counsel helped to smooth out many difficulties. Mr. Blackett, the
Honorary Architect, has given his services for many years, and was respon-
sible for the alterations to Somers House and the Rest Room at the Show
grounds. In the early days Sir Charles Merrett formed a Men’s Auxiliary,
collecting the first guinea subscription from Lord Somers.
The first Younger Set Conference was held in September, 1932, an
account of which is given elsewhere.
The following year Mrs. J. S. Fraselr presented the Fraser Cup for
Branch Community work at the Handicraft Exhibition. This gift of Mrs.
Fraser s, and another from Mrs. Oswald Syme of a cup for Group Com-
munity Work, fostered something of vital importance, good team work.
Competition for these cups is always keen, some most ingenious exhibits have


MISS ELSA GRICE
State President 1935-36
MRS. W. E. SARGOOD, J.P.
State President 1936-37


MISS ELSA GRICE
Miss Elsa Grice was State President from 1935-6, but her service for country
women really started in November, 1926, when, at her instigation, the Victorian
League formed its Development Committee. The following year, she had the
pleasure of seeing seven Women’s Institutes formed and working on the lines of
those in England.
In 1928, when the Women’s Institutes decided to join the Association, their
Committee was co-opted and re-named the Handicrafts and Home Industries Com-
mittee, Miss Grice became its first Chairman, a position she held for four years. Miss
Grice started the Craft Library with a gift of books in 1928; she was always very
interested in the cultural side of the work, and was a prime mover in the Endowment
Fund and the Scholarship Fund which is named after her.
She is the eldest daughter of the late Sir John Grice; travelling and the study of
music and modern languages have occupied much of her time. During the 1914
war she qualified as a nurse at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.
Miss Grice was Deputy President 1932-5, State President 1935-6, an elected
member of Executive 1937-40, and State President 1940-2, and Group President
for the Central Highlands from 1942-4.
MRS. W. E. SARGOOD, j.p.
Mrs. W, E. Sargood is an Englishwoman who, after her marriage, lived in
New Zealand for two years before coming to Australia.
After living in the Hamilton district for a time, she spent nine years near Geelong.
During the 1914 war she worked in London and on her return to Australia was
Honorary Secretary of the Society of Overseas Settlement of British Women, till
1920, when she moved to Corowa.
Becoming a member of the Country Women’s Association in 1928, she was
a Country Vice-President by April, 1929, and had formed the Corowa Branch, of
which she was President for three years, and later again for a further three years.
When branches were organized into Groups Mrs. Sargood became . the first
Group President of the North-Eastern Group for three years, and later held the
position for another term of three years, during which time she organized the Baby
Health Centre in conjunction with the Corowa C.W.A., and formed many branches,
including St. Kilda; also the first Younger Set Group.
She was deeply interested in the Associated Country Women of the World
holding the office of Vice-President for Australasia 1939-47 and attended the Con-
ference at Amsterdam before relinquishing office. In addition, she was the Victorian
State International Officer from 1938-43.
Although Mrs. Sargood called the first meeting in Victoria to discuss the unity
of States in 1937, it was not till 1945 that the Country Women’s Association of
Australia came into being.
Country Vice-President, 1929; Group President, North-Eastern Group, 1930;

been entered. In one, a Pioneer Kitchen, the stove was made from an old
tin trunk, in another there were two life-size figures, Mr. and Mrs. Thrifty,
clad in home-spun and hand-woven clothing. The enterprising people who
made them were not at all perturbed when they had set up their exhibit in
the Town Hall, to discover Mrs. T. had no wedding ring; a quick trip to a
nearby tobacconist yielded a fat cigar complete with a gold band which served
the purpose! Working for these community exhibits is good fun, it brings
members together and welds the branch or group into a single unit; it also
disciplines the workers to a certain degree, for they must plan their work care-
fully and adhere to their plan to the last detail.
The Endowment Fund was opened in 1933.
* * * *
The first Inter-State Conference was held in Mrs. Fraser’s house in
October, 1934. During Miss Grice’s term of office as State President, disastrous
floods caused much hardship, and, as usual, the Association was prompt to help
and started a Flood Relief Fund. Early that same year (1935) a successful
Holiday Camp was held at Portland and was well attended by members and
their families, who had come from far and wide to Portland to share in its
Centenary celebrations.
Special Celebrations were held throughout the State during the Melbourne
Centenary and the visit of the Duke of Gloucester; tree-planting was popular
and was sometimes made a community effort, each member planting a tree.
Mrs. Sargood succeeded Miss Grice as State President in 1936, and that
year, through the good offices of Mr. Oswald Syme, the Royal Agricultural
Society offered the Association a building to use as a Rest Room, free of cost,
provided that it was kept in order. The Macedon branch most generously dona-
ted £250 to renovate it and, with the exception of the war years, it has been a
happy meeting place for country women at the Royal Show ever since.
* * * *
There was widespread sorrow in the Association over the death of Mrs.
Fraser; her kindly, easy manner had endeared her to everybody. By 1936
the number of Group Presidents had been increased to 27; they carry the
burden of organizing in the country, of smoothing out difficulties in the
branches, and forming a link with the Executive and the Handicrafts and
Home Industries Committee, of which they are ex-officio members. All this
involves them in endless travelling and correspondence, but their work is
invaluable to the Association as a whole.
The Ocean Grove Branch established a seaside cottage for membersand
their families in 1936; it proved most popular and always has a long waiting
list.

Secretaries’ Conferences during Conference Week were now a regular part
of the programme and always proved most helpful to all concerned.
Mrs. Hicken became State President in 1938 and the disturbed state of
the world was reflected in the decision of the Conference to prepare for any
national emergency by starting First Aid and Home Nursing classes in the
branches.
Now the dark shadow of war fell on our bright tapestry, and to a
considerable extent changed its colour and pattern. The bright threads of
craft work were turned to khaki wool, green string for camouflage; natural wool
for seamen’s pullovers and sheepskin vests replaced gay hooked rugs, fine
needlework, etc. But not even war could alter the amazing generosity and
energy of country women; it was only an added spur to them. Our tapestry
was as good as ever, only more sombre in colour and severe in design.
By 1939, the results of the years of fostering interchange of visits
between branches and the interest and enjoyment in Group Conferences were
shown in the steadily increasing unity of the Groups, which were undertaking
more objectives of wider scope and greater cost.
The Association was being welded into one whole, and this process was
continued during the war years of 1939-45.
Branches began to look beyond their own local boundaries and to regard
themselves as parts of the whole —the Association.
The appeal for the pedal transmitting set for the Australian Aerial
Medical Services launched in 1937 was completed by March, 1939, and the
set eventually installed at Leopold Downs. The destructive bush-fires which
swept Victoria in 1939 and again in 1944 left ruin and desolation in their
wake; the response to this national emergency by the Association was
immediate and practical. Branches contributed to local funds and members
volunteered for service at the depots distributing food and clothing and
other relief. Gifts of money and goods poured in from branches all over
the State, sometimes going direct to the stricken areas and sometimes to Head-
quarters. Group Presidents in the areas most affected were given grants of
money from the Emergency Fund (formerly Flood Relief Account) to assist
burnt-out members, while others collected information on any family needing
help. In some cases large branches “adopted” others and in at least one instance
branch money, burned before it could be banked, was replaced by a neighbouring
branch. Donations were also sent by Queensland and Tasmania.


In these ways a friendly, helpful spirit was fostered between different
parts of the State and between States. 1
In September, 1940, the Country Women’s Association Home Help
Scheme was inaugurated by the Metropolitan Branches under the leadership
of Mrs. Norman Welsh. Mrs. Gribbin was the first Help. This scheme,
which over the years has proved a real boon to many hundreds of country
members, is wholly financed by the Metropolitan Branches, each one paying an
annual quota to the fund. In 1944, the Metropolitan Group organized several
functions, including two evenings at the National Theatre; an exhibition of
historical costumes and a huge fair, and catered for luncheons and supper at
the State Conference. The £1,176 thus raised put the finances of the Home
Help on a very sound basis.
The extent and scope of this service to country members is only limited
by the number of helps obtainable.
Almost from the beginning of the Association the question of branches
on the New South Wales and Victorian border came up for discussion. A
conference was arranged in Sydney between representatives of the two States,
whereby a reciprocal arrangement was effected and, to the end of 1947, 14
branches over the border had joined in with Victoria.
With the outbreak of war in 1939 the activities of members and branches
were enlarged and widened to include war efforts, which naturally, as the
war proceeded, took a greater amount of time and energy. Many thousands
of members trained for A.R.P., St. John’s Ambulance, and Red Cross work,
and steadily supported the Red Cross, A.C.F., and other patriotic appeals.
Money-making efforts for these were continuous and varied, as well as
for the provision of comforts and parcels and canteen orders for local district
men and women in the forces.
Funds flowed for the P.O.W.’s, one branch alone donating £9OO in one
year; two groups donated ambulances and another raised £SOO for the Mer-
chant Navy. Herbs and vegetables were grown; onion seed sent to England;
V.A.O.C. posts manned; waste collections helped and books and magazines
sent to troops; blood donors contributed to blood banks, while children s
emergency clothing was made from discarded military garments and three
special appeals by the Y.W.C.A. for service women generously helped. In
fact, no fund or appeal was neglected or overlooked. It was during these
years that the Executive, in an endeavour to protect branches from too many
appeals and from their own enthusiastic response, inaugurated the policy of
first considering such appeals and sponsoring those they thought most worthy
of encouragement.
Association Rest Rooms were made available to patriotic organizations for
meetings and working parties and other functions, while the Association
rooms at the Melbourne Show Grounds were used by the R.A.A.F, Somers


House, also, was loaned as a hostel to the Auxiliary for Evacuees and later
to the Y.W.C.A. as a hostel for service women.
After the 1940 Conference War Savings Groups were formed in branches,
until by 1942 the General Secretary could report that “practically every branch
has now formed a savings group and over £6,000 was already in bonds and
certificates—a conservative estimate.” One small branch of eleven members
had £IOO in War Savings Certificates and by 1943 Branch Annual Reports
showed £10,720 held in bonds and certificates. Surplus funds and money in
hand for building projects were put into loans. With the help of members,
the Association subscribed its quota every time it was allotted one in the
Victory and Security loans.
Soldiers’ wives were invited and welcomed at branch meetings and very
often made guest members, and the Association was represented on the
Evacuees Welfare Association. Metropolitan branches played their part by
visiting the women from Hong Kong and arranging special functions to enable
them to meet each other and Association members.
When Victorian service men and women began sending home grateful
and glowing accounts of the kind hospitality of the Quorn and Tennant Creek
members, Victorian branches spontaneously responded by collecting money to
help the good work continue.
Besides all this, members gave hospitality to service men and women
stationed in their districts, arranged entertainments and even mending parties
at nearby camps. One small branch entertained and billeted nearly 100 soldiers
every few weeks.
In 1940 also the Empire Gift was commenced—a voluntary giving by
members of one penny per week—£l,ooo was collected in the first eight months
in Victoria. All States of Australia, excepting South Australia, took part in
this effort and in February, 1941, £2500 was sent to Mr. Bruce (later Viscount
Bruce), the Australian High Commissioner in London, to be handed by him
to the Prime Minister as an unconditional gift to the King, who allocated this
to the King’s Fund.
A second instalment was sent to the Y.W.C.A. in Britain for service
women and the third and final again to the Prime Minister, with the love
and loyalty of the Country Women of Australia. Of the sum of £4,871/9/10,
Victoria contributed £2,445/9/6.
Victorian members decided to continue their weekly penny donations to
a Post-War Requirements Fund to assist some post-war project. At the 1946
Cc nference the-£1,223 was voted between the War Widows Guild and the
Lord Mayor’s Food for Britain Fund. The penny donations still continue,
however, under a new name, “Thanksgiving Fund,” and each Conference the
money in hand is voted to some useful purpose —one year to the Association’s
Fund, which is used to help our own members, and the next, to the
Association’s Food for Britain parcels.


MRS. A. C. BENNETT
State President 1940-41-42
MRS. O. A. HICKEN
State President 1938-29-45-46-47


MRS. O. A. HICKEN, j.p.
Mrs. Olive Hicken, j.p., is a country woman who has spent nearly all her life
at Shepparton. She was one of three country women invited by Sir Charles Merrett
to a meeting at the Show Grounds in 1927 to consider the formation of a Country
Women’s Association. At a public meeting called a little later she was elected to
the Provisional Committee appointed to draw up a constitution, rules and objectives.
She formed 27 out of the 34 branches in the Goulburn Valley area, and branches
in other parts of the State.
She became a District Vice-President in 1928 and continued till 1932. She
was Honorary Assistant State Treasurer 1932-8. State President, 1938, 1939.
She then became an Elected Member of the State Executive Committee 1940-1.
She again became the Honorary Assistant State Treasurer, resigning to become State
President for a second term 1945-7. She was a Group President for three years,
Branch President for three years, Branch Secretary for six years, Branch Treasurer
for three years.
She demonstrated handicrafts in her district in the early days of the C.W.A.,
helping the small branches with their meetings.
She became a j.p. in 1927 and is a Magistrate for the Children’s Court and
a Probation Officer. She organized the Shepparton Baby Health Centre and was
Honorary Secretary for 15 years. She was a Girl Guide Captain for three years.
She organized and brought up to date the local Mechanics’ Library. During the
war she helped with local patriotic work of all sorts. She is now a member of the
Prices Commission. In the 1914-18 war she served as a V.A.D. and went to Salonika.
MRS. A. C. BENNETT
Mrs. Bennett is a country woman who lived in Ballarat till her marriage, when
she went to Dimboola, where she has since lived. She organized the formation of
the Dimboola C.W.A. and was its first President in 1934. She was second Group
President of the West Wimmera Group for three years, 1936, 1937, 1938. She
was State President 1940-2, Chairman of the Handicrafts and Home Industries
Committee 1943-4.
Mrs. Bennett was very ill during part of her term as State President and had
to cancel all engagements, but, in spite of this, travelled over a great part of the
State. The C.W.A. Land Army was formed during her presidency and she was
instrumental in obtaining a Vacation Land Army School at Longerenong Agricultural
College.
She was a member of the Women’s Advisory Committee for the State Evacuation
from February, 1942, to December, 1943, representing country interests and areas.
She was on the Committee of the Red Cross in the 1914-18 war. She was
Superintendent of Red Cross Emergency Company in Dimboola and on Committee
of Dimboola Red Cross. She has been first District, then Divisional, and finally
Area Commissioner for the Girl Guides Association.


1940 saw the beginnings of several Association war activities. In June,
Mrs. W. A. Kilpatrick and Miss Ruth Forbes organized the collecting of
Silver Junk —gold and silver articles which were either sold as articles or
melted down; starting with a donation of £3OO, the fund realized £2,096
for an Army Medical Unit.
In 1940, also, Mrs. S. V. Sewell (later Lady Sewell) first suggested
that young women might be trained to do land work as a national service.
Branches were requested to contact available young women and also farmers
to find out if they would use the services of women when man labour became
scarce. A plan was evolved for holding training schools of about a week in
different parts of the country.
The first school was held at Berwick when 22 women—2o of them
country girls—gained practical knowledge of land work on stations, mixed
farms, dairy farms and orchards. In August, 1941, 24 women attended a two-
weeks training course at Longerenong. In all, Lady Sewell estimates that she
made more than 200 satisfactory appointments of women to all types of
farms.
In 1942, when the Government decided to set up a Women’s Land Army
the State Executive wrote to the Director-General of Manpower, suggesting
that Mrs. Sewell, “who has done so much in connection with women’s land
work, be invited to act on the Committee set up to deal with the Women’s
Land Army.” But as she had already been approached to act personally on
this Committee, the State President was appointed to represent the Associa-
tion. Members and branches in many parts of the State undertook to mother
land army girls—dances, pictures, picnics and other entertainments were
arranged for them, and play readings and demonstrations taken to the hostels.
Members gave hospitality to many individuals and assisted this vital section
of the Services in every way possible. Besides this, Metropolitan members
made up innumerable hessian curtains for window and wardrobe coverings in
hostels.
The State President and Lady Sewell also represented the Association
on the Victorian Amenities Committee for the Land Army instigated by
Lady Dugan, wife of the Governor of Victoria. Thanks to Lady Dugan,
the panel van, donated to the Amenities Committee by the R.A.C.V., was
later handed on to us for use as a Home Science van. Slightly modified and
F
17


repainted with the name “Home Science Van, Country Women’s Association
of Victoria,” clearly lettered on the side, the van has been continuously on
the roads since September, 1946, and has proved a popular venture with
country members. Driven by voluntary drivers and carrying a fine exhibit of
general crafts, the van is staffed by demonstrators of dressmaking, millinery,
nutrition, weaving, spinning, basketry and papier mache dolls, to name just
some of the crafts and talks of interest to far back members, who might not
otherwise have the opportunity of seeing at first hand beautifully finished
work of trained craftswomen.
In May, 1944, the then newest Association Patriotic Fund was registered
as the C.W.A. Circulating Library for the Services, and by June, 1945, had
already spent over £900 on books j altogether many thousands of books were
donated to the fighting services at a total cost of £1,018.
With C.W.A. book plates pasted in by the Metropolitan members, the
books were packed into library cases, for transport to men and women in far
distant stations in Australia and beyond, and some were even parachuted to
men behind the Japanese lines. Several hundred books, also, were given to
the Army Education Mobile Unit, which operated in the North, in isolated
areas which could not be reached by the circulating Library Boxes.
Two other tremendous undertakings of the war years carried on cheer-
fully and efficiently by the Association were first suggested, and, for the most
part, organized by Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald.
Sheepskin Vests
T T was in April, 1939, when war seemed very close even to remote Australia,
that members of our Association were discussing ways and means of
helping our country if war came, and a scheme was then drawn up for provid-
ing sheepskin vests for men of the Air Force and Navy.
War did come and our plans were ready, though we were faced with
many problems of securing sufficient suitable skins, problems of freight, trans-
port, tanning, the making up of the vests and their distribution.
Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald, who organized the scheme, realizing that the
costs would be tremendous, carried it out on a practically voluntary basis.
Appeals were made to farmers and big flock owners to donate pelts to
the scheme j their response was immediate and overwhelming support for the
scheme was received from every quarter, from free freight on the railways
to the offer of Messrs. Vary Bros, to tan and make up the vests at cost of
labour and material. The distribution of the vests was undertaken by the
Australian Comforts Fund.
The finished vest was a splendid article, light and warm, and long in the
back and double-breasted. No part of the skins was wasted; the off-cuts were


made up by C.W.A. members into many thousands of R.A.A.F. gloves, Navy
mittens, hospital slippers, children’s slippers, etc.
Over 14,000 vests were distributed to our Fighting Forces, to Air Force
trainees of the Empire Air Training Scheme, to the Navy and special units of
the Army, to mine-sweepers and the British Mercantile Navy, 1,000 vests were
given to the Department of the Army for the use of the P.O.W.’s on the planes
flying them back to Australia from Singapore, and at the request of the
Defence Department the A.A.N.s and A.A.M.W.A.s proceeding to Japan with
the Army of Occupation were fitted out with vests.
Camouflage Nets for the Fighting Forces
IT was in the early days of the second World War that the Country
Women’s Association of Victoria, hearing that the Defence Department
was in urgent need of great numbers of camouflage nets for military pur-
poses, offered the services of the Association to organize and administer, in
a voluntary capacity, a scheme for the making of camouflage nets throughout
Victoria. This offer was gratefully accepted by the Defence Department and
Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald was asked to undertake the organization of the
scheme.
The response by our C.W.A. branches and the general public was mag-
nificent. Net-making groups were quickly formed all over the State, men,
women and children, old and young, in country and town, gave up their
time to help in this national work. Over 600 groups of net-makers came into
being—600 individual workers were attached to the Central Depot at 316
Flinders Lane.
Camouflage nets of every size and type were made, from the great 35
feet by 35 feet nets to fit gun emplacements, to the small 14 feet by 7 feet
machine-gun nets. Nets to cover aeroplanes were constructed, as well as
12,000 aerial supply nets for the dropping from aeroplanes of medical sup-
plies, food and equipment for front-line troops. Over 150,000 camouflage
nets were made in this State for the Government, and these nets were used by
our troops in all their campaigns, in the Middle East deserts, on transports,
in the jungles of New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, the nets becoming an
essential part of their equipment and the means of saving many valuable lives.
Food Parcels for Britain
On the cessation of the lend-lease arrangements and the resulting food
shortage in Great Britain, investigations were made as to the best way we
could assist our kinsfolk overseas, and it was found that the only way to give
immediate help was to send food parcels to individuals. The Headquarters
of the Women’s Institutes cabled their gratitude for the offered gifts and


from early in September, 1945, food parcels were sent to branches of the
Women’s Institutes in England, Wales, Scotland and in some cases Northern
Ireland. The first 700 parcels were packed and on the water in less than a
week after the opening of the appeal. The Free Kindergarten Union workers
at the Silver Door have packed and despatched all our parcels and their
courtesy and efficiency have ensured the success of the scheme, as well as the
supervision of lists and records undertaken by Mrs. B. Thomas. To date
(December, 1948) well over £15,504 has been contributed to this fund and
nearly 20,500 parcels sent through Headquarters alone. A far greater
number have gone direct from the branches, one branch alone sending 100
every month. In 1947 a new development was the adoption of about 400
British ex-prisoners of war by branches, who send a parcel each month with
the hope that these will help them regain some measure of health. Both
the senders and the receivers of parcels have appreciated and enjoyed the
personal contact and a great flood of letters has been interchanged between
women in Britain and Victoria, strengthening the feeling of kinship and the
bonds of Empire. Women’s Institutes in Britain have tried in many ways
to show their gratitude and when the Federation of Women’s Institutes sug-
gested that books might be sent to the Victorian Country Women’s Association
as a token of appreciation, manv lovely books were posted to us, to become
the nucleus of a Travelling Library for our outback branches. That such a
scheme meets an urgent need is apparent from the large number of requests
for library boxes. This, the baby project of the Association is one that must
and will grow into something large and comprehensive.
Fat for Britain
A! the end of 1946 a collection of Fat for Britain was added to the
Association activities. As well as food parcels, branches had generously
responded to the Lord Mayor of Melbourne’s appeal for food and fat for
Britain, and when this appeal closed the Association undertook to continue the
collection and preparation of fat for despatch to Britain. Thanks are due to
the many firms and individuals who gave their services unstintingly and
without charge to assist this scheme. Handbury and Son processed and canned
edible fat; W. G. Pennell made soap from the inedible, Mayne Nickless
carried free all fat from the railways to the factories, the Treasury granted
free rail for the fat, the Rosella Co. supplied the tins at a nominal cost, and
many individuals assisted branches in collection of fat. Practically the only cost
was for the tin plate used for the 1 lb. tins in which we found it preferable
to send the fat, and many donations have been received for this purpose.
Besides the main C.W.A. appeal the Geelong Group has given tins of fat to
the masters of ships sailing from that port for distribution by the crews in Great
Britain; one of the Northern Groups has sent many tins of fat to Sydney for


MRS. H. G. MARFELL
State President 1942-42-44-45
MRS. NORMAN WELSH
State President 1947-48-49


MRS. H. G. MARFELL, j.p.
Mrs. Marfell, born near Camperdown of Scottish parents, has lived all her
life in the Western District, for many years in Warrnambool. Because of her wide
and varied interests, her flair for organizing and her “drive”, she is a well-known
public figure in the district, and has earned a reputation for always getting things
done. Her energy is unflagging, and no cause appeals for her aid in vain. Her
interests include Kindergarten, Baby Health Centres, Church work and Red Cross,
for which during the war she was a District Superintendent.
She was a foundation member of the Warrnambool branch, holding office since
its inception 18 years ago. She has been three times Group President of the South
Western Group. She was State President for three years during the war (1942-45)
travelling all over the State and representing the Association on many wartime
committees and visiting most of the States.
When the Country Women’s Association of Australia was formed, she became
the first Chairwoman, and in this capacity again represented the C.W.A. on important
committees, going to Canberra to attend one of these.
For two years she was a Central Vice-President, and for the last year an Elected
Member of the Executive, and has visited many parts of the State, besides sitting
on many committees of the Association.
MRS. NORMAN WELSH
Mrs. Norman Welsh is the daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Shields,
who were well known in the north-east of Victoria. She was horn near Sale in
Gippsland hut spent her girlhood days in and around Wodonga. After her marriage
she and her husband lived at Fulham Station, one of the properties owned by the
Welsh Brothers, 100 miles out of Cobar, in the Western District of New South
Wales; later they settled on a property 20 miles out of Albury. When the Country
Women’s Association was formed there she was the first President and it was during
her term of office that the Country Women’s Association Rest Room and the
Baby Health Centre were established in Albury. She has travelled extensively and
while on a trip to England in 1933 attended the Stockholm Conference of the
Associated Country Women of the World as one of the Australian delegates.
She was for some years on the Somers House Committee and Chairman when
the house was resumed after the war, a Central Vice-President, President of the
Yarra Branch and Metropolitan Group President. She was responsible for starting
the Home Help Scheme in Victoria in 1941 and was its first Chairman and then
Honorary Treasurer, which position she still holds. While in office as State Vice-
President 1945-6 and State President 1947-8-9, she travelled the State very widely
in the interests of the Association.
It was largely due to her energy and enthusiasm that the property, 3 Lansell
Road, Toorak, was purchased and opened as a Country Women’s Association
resident club.


distribution to ships in port there, while the Wannon Group organizes a similar
scheme from Portland.
When, in 1948, the State Fat Appeal was organized the Association
again co-operated with that appeal.
Although the khaki threads predominated more and more during the
war years, the brighter colours of peace-time interests continued to be woven
into the tapestry of C.W.A. life—more subdued, perhaps, but still clear.
In 1945 the General Secretary could report: “The general activities of
the branches are so numerous that it is impossible to give a detailed account
of them, but it is safe to say, I think, that every phase of community life has
been assisted in some way or other.” “Branches have not neglected other
activities, as is shown by donations to practically every appeal or organization,
amounting in all to over £6,000 this year.”
By 1946 Miss Strong, who became General Secretary in 1944, was able
to report that branches were gradually transferring from war work to peace-
time activities. Mrs. Norman Welsh and Mrs. Geoffrey Norris organized
the Free Wool for U.N.R.R.A. appeal at the request of the Australian Wool
Board. Branches responded readily and in Jess than fourteen days the Victorian
quota of £1,000 worth of wool was being knitted. In all, 10,000 garments
were handed to U.N.R.R.A., practically all of exhibition standard.
Scholarship
A specific C.W.A. development was the first award of the scholarship
to Miss Joan Neylan, of Ararat, to do a course at the Free Kindergarten
Training College. »
This year the Annual Conference decided that, until the Scholarship fund
reached the objective of £3,000, half of all the donations received would be
put to this fund and the other half used for extra scholarships. As a result
three extra scholarships were awarded in 1947, and five in 1948, when it
was reported that the £3,000 objective was reached and all donations would
henceforth be used for extra scholarships. The first endowed scholarship,
the “Elsa Grice,” so-named because it was suggested by Miss Grice while
she was a Deputy President, and the fund it inaugurated during her term
as State President, was awarded to David J. Richards for a course of Dental
Science. The students so far assisted have undertaken courses in Kindergarten,
Social Services, Agricultural Science, Medicine, Engineering and an Arts course
for teaching. Besides the Association Scholarship several Groups award their
own scholarships in memory of former Group Presidents, and one branch gives
two bursaries to a local school.
Another innovation in 1946 was the weekly Association broadcast, while
more and more Groups were arranging programmes over their local stations.

Residential Club
As early as 1944 members could see the necessity for a residential Club
in Melbourne for country members visiting the City. Although the time for
this was not then opportune, a Club Room was opened in Manton’s Bourke
Street Store through the generosity of Messrs. Ivor and Jack Manton. Staffed
by Metropolitan members, five days a week, this club room remained open until
May, 1948, when every effort was being made to obtain premises for the
residential club either in the city or near in suburbs. A few months later No.
3 Lansell Road, Toorak, was acquired and was opened for its first visitors
early in December.
The post-war years have been a period of development and growth; we
now talk in thousands where once we spoke of dozens or hundreds. In 1948
the Annual Conference was attended by 2,000 delegates. Interest in the inter-
national side of the work has been stimulated by the Food Parcels and by the
wonderful response to the appeal for the starving children of the world by
U.N.A.C., when over £7,000 was contributed through the Head Office.
The U.N.A.C. Committee also attributes much of the success of the
appeal in the country to C.W.A. branches, which not only co-operated whole-
heartedly with their local Councils but, in many cases, organized their own
districts.
Mrs. B. Thomas, who so ably held the position of International Officer
from 1946-8, and who also supervises all the orders for Food Parcels, had
best tell of the growth and development of the international work of the
Association.


International
Our Widening Horizon
IN this organizaton of country women, the primary object was to provide a
means for members to meet regularly to discuss their problems and to
acquire information concerning their responsibilities as home-makers and
citizens. Hitherto the country women had lived and worked almost entirely
within the four walls of their homes. The C.W.A. has shown that to live the
eminently useful, happy life, there must be a constant giving and getting for
the highest development of one’s self and the greatest good to one’s neigh-
bours. And so it was inevitable that the horizon of the country women should
widen j and widen it did, beyond the confines of her community, State and
country, and she learned that there were country women in other lands with
the same ideals, aims and objectives as our own, who were anxious to hear
about her and from her.
The international work progressed from 1936 when the first links were
formed with the Women’s Institutes in Britain. Dried fruits, butter and handi-
crafts were sent to the links; one W.I. made a cake with some of the fruit and sent
it back to their link, and there was a happy interchange of thoughts and ideas,
too.
It was in 1936 that Mrs. Norman Welsh attended the first conference
of the Associated Countrywomen of the World (A.C.W.W.) in Norway, and
in 1938 we became affiliated.
Interests in overseas links and letter-friends greatly increased and in
1939 Mrs. W. E. Sargood was appointed our first State International Officer.
The three main functions of the International Office are:
To make members aware of the news and viewpoints of women of other
lands;
To bring them together in a mutual bond of friendship and goodwill
through links and letter-friendships;
To interest members in the International Day study and the A.C.W.W.
In this office Mrs. Sargood (who was also a Vice-President of A.C.W.W.)
did splendid work and many hundreds of links were made by her with country
women in many lands.
1939 proved to be a year of special interest internationally, in more ways
than one; three of our members, Mrs. Caddy, Mrs. Thornley and Mrs. B. G.
Thomas, represented us at the A.C.W.W. Conference in London. Much more
was learned about the A.C.W.W. from these delegates, who told us of its
possibilities for helping to build a better world. Unfortunately, war broke
out just three months after the Conference and delayed the carrying out of
plans made for spreading friendship and goodwill through understanding and
sympathy.


In 1945 Mrs. Sargood retired and Mrs. J. A. MacDonald was appointed
State International Officer, and as the work and interest had greatly increased,
a committee was appointed to help and advise her. Mrs. MacDonald believed
that “When women fully understand their destiny, they might mother all
humanity,” and she strove to help us to understand it. Unfortunately, Mrs.
MacDonald retired after only one year in office on account of ill-health.
With a high appreciation of the work of her predecessors and a sense
of the urgency and necessity of every individual taking a more active part in
international affairs, Mrs. B. G. Thomas took office and with the help of a
keen committee the work continued to grow.
We became aware of the necessity of making ourselves acquainted with
the work of the United Nations Organizations and became a member of U.N.O.
giving special support, through the A.C.W.W., to the United Nations Food and
Agricultural Organization and the United Nations Appeal for the war-stricken
children of the world. This appeal found a ready response from our members
and the sum of over £7,000 was contributed.
After the war the A.C.W.W. prepared a Memorandum on Post-War
Reconstruction and, to stimulate interest in this memorandum, which dealt
with Nutrition, Housing, Health and Education, an essay competition was
held and many good entries were received, showing that members had given
it careful thought. Its two basic principles have a special appeal to all country
women:
1. That no peaceful future can exist for the world unless national and
international law is based on Spiritual Power.
2. That no one generation can own the earth. Each is but a trustee for
the generation to follow. It is our duty to discharge our trusteeship so that
our soil may be handed to our children in at least as good a condition as we
found it.
Of important interest to the branches is our International Day. Each year
a country is chosen for special study and it was the custom for the International
Officer to prepare a paper giving information about the way of life of the
people in the chosen country. For the last two years we have prepared an
international edition of Country Crafts which has proved very popular. Last
year we chose Finland, and no one was more interested than the country
women of Finland. They went to much trouble to make a beautiful scrap-
book for us, showing in picture and story their way of life in Finland and
now we are making a scrap-book as a means of telling our friends in other
countries about Australia, and especiallv Victoria. As a result of our Inter-
national Day study, thirty pen-friends were made with the Agricultural
Women and the Marthas Association in Finland.
Now the work goes on in the capable hands of Mrs. G. O. Dorward,
who represented us at the last Conference of the A.C.W.W. in Amsterdam,
where it was agreed that the most important thing to be aimed at to-day is


a peaceful world that is most surely built on good relations between peoples.
Mrs. Sargood also attended the Conference as retiring Vice-President of the
A.C.W.W.
It was our great pleasure, during the last two years, to welcome to Victoria
Mrs. Chas. Russell, Miss Zimmern and Miss Hearndon, all active officers of
the A.C.W.W. and the personal contact with these women who had carried
on so nobly through the difficult war years was an inspiration to us all.
The measure of every community is in the attitude of each individual
toward the ideals of justice, peace and order. When we achieve these locally,
we can achieve them nationally and internationally. We must establish these
ideals first in the home.
In the C.W.A. we have a group of sincere, cultured home-makers, doing
a work which has developed into a mighty human force for human uplift and
human happiness, regardless of race, colour or creed. As we go forward into
the world of tomorrow, let us continue to render service, to work in unity and
with courage in the cause of human happiness and well-being, throughout the
whole wide world.
The scope of the Association is very wide and its interests all-embracing,
whatever concerns the welfare of women and children is the concern of the
Association and, in pursuance of this, it is represented on many organizations
whose functions are particular aspects of women’s interests. Baby Health
Centres, Girl Guides Association, Comniittee for Social Problems, Victorian
Aboriginal Group, Children’s Cinema and Associated Country Women of the
World, to name only a few.
Quilts for British Children
UNDER this scheme, organized in 1943 by Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald to
enable our branches to further their patriotic work, wool-filled quilts
were sent to England for the little children of the bombed area, thus providing
warmth and comfort for these children who had so greatly suffered the ravages
of war.
The scheme grew quickly, extending its sphere of activities, our C.W.A.
members giving most enthusiastic support.
The quilts are made up and decorated in the branches, sent to our Depot
at “316,” where they are filled with soft wool and quilted by hand or machine.
Thousands of quilts, afghans, fleece blankets, sheets, pillowcases and beauti-
fully knitted children’s clothes have been despatched to England, where their
distribution is carried out by Government Nurseries in the London industrial
areas and by our Victorian Agent-General in London, Sir Norman Martin,
and his wife.
During the disastrous floods over 700 sheets and well over 1,500 pillow
cases were despatched to England, and in the 1948 Annual Report Mrs.


McDonald reports that “over 12,000 articles—quilts, blankets, afghans and
children’s clothing of all descriptions, a total value of £9,351, has been
forwarded to Great Britain since the work commenced.” This work still con-
tinues ; the need for such help is still urgent.
Other Activities
jD RANCH reports emphasize the increasing part that members are taking in
local activities of all sorts. In many cases their advice is sought in commu-
nity planning and everywhere is shown the desire to improve local conditions,
especially as they affect women and children. This results in a variety of
activities, libraries, established or assisted, halls built or equipped, swimming
pools advocated, ambulances and hospitals assisted, ’bus shelters built for school
children.
The planting of trees, the beautifying of their own towns and districts has
always been one of the objectives impressed on members, who, again, years later
made the Twenty-first Birthday of Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth
the occasion for many tree planting ceremonies throughout the State. The years
between have seen trees planted to honour other important events and branches
can point with pride to plantations and avenues.
Tree consciousness is increasing. Assistance given schools is very great,
prizes are awarded, equipment supplied and libraries and playgrounds estab'
lished. Picnics and Christmas treats are the order of the day.
Practically every charity, both State-wide and local, has been assisted j
in 1947-8 nearly £11,000 was given to other than C.W.A. funds and this
without the main aims of the Association being forgotten. The branch that
reports its meetings as popular and joyous is considered to be doing as good
work as the one with a large bank balance.
Together with every other loyal subject, members rejoiced at the mar-
riage of Her Royal Highness the Princess Elizabeth, and all were eager to
show their loyalty and affection by contributing to a wedding present —a typical
Australian landscape by the well-known Australian painter, J. R. Jackson. The
remainder of the £480 subscribed was used to send food parcels to British
ex-P.O.W.; this with the full approval of the Princess.
Because we are a loyal body of women, with the motto “Honour to God,
Loyalty to the Throne and Empire, Service to the Country,” in future all
members are to be asked to sign a card pledging themselves to uphold the aims
and ideals of the Association as given in the Motto.
And so the work goes on —holiday homes and camps are becoming increas-
ingly popular, many groups and branches have funds in hand for the
purchase of property or buildings, one group ran a summer camp for children
of deceased servicemen, other branches have outings for city children.


Conclusion
IN the past 21 years the Association has achieved such real assets as the
Seaside Homes and the Club in the City where members may stay ; living
conditions in the country have been improved by the Home Help Scheme, Rest
Rooms in towns and villages, Library Boxes, Scholarships, the Home Science
Van, and so on. Through the Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee
lectures and practical demonstrations are available, their Musical and Dramatic
Sub-committee encourages play-reading, part-singing and dramatic entertain-
ments. The International Secretary and her committee bring women in the
most remote districts into touch with distant lands and encourage them to look
beyond their immediate surroundings, to know and understand other races.
The increase in branches and membership has been remarkable; so far it
has been well balanced. May the Association always remain essentially a
country one, primarily for the woman on the farm, so planned that she may be
able to enjoy its benefits in good seasons or bad ones. To ensure this branches
need so to balance their programmes that they cater for all ages and tastes,
enabling any woman to join without the fear of undue demands on her purse.
A member must give of her best to her branch, whether as an office-bearer,
helper, craftworker, or, equally important, a good “mixer.” Just as she gives
her time, work, enthusiasm and loyalty or money, she should also receive
much, be it friendly intercourse, fresh interests, instruction, or an outlet for
latent talent. This give and take is vital to the spirit of the Association.
Much as the Association has to offer members, it makes heavy demands
on its leaders. The accounts of each of the nine State Presidents who have held
office in the 21 years are very brief. It would be invidious to compare their
work, they have all been so different, yet each one has worked some of her
personality into our tapestry. As the Association has grown it has made increas-
ing demands on the State Presidents. To take office now means an almost
complete sacrifice of home life; this applies equally to the Group Presi-
dents. We owe our office-bearers a big debt of gratitude for all the work
they so cheerfully and unselfishly undertake.
To conclude our simile of a tapestry, in 21 years it has been wrought
so well there need be no empty spaces in the lives of country women.
The colours that were dimmed by war are clear and bright once more.
There are many directions in which it may expand and a wealth of interest
and enthusiasm for such expansion. It is indeed a tapestry to be proud of.


HANDICRAFTS AND HOME INDUSTRIES COMMITTEE
A BRIEF outline of the origin of the Handicrafts and Home Industries
Tx Committee has already been given j the following records its growth
and expansion.
The Victoria League, desiring to help the many new settlers, and to
make country life more attractive for women, formed the Development Com-
mittee, with Lady Maudsley as chairman, and the following as members: Lady
Masson, Mrs. David Grant, Miss Elsa Grice and Mrs. Rupert Greene, in
November, 1925. By February, 1926, Miss Grice and Miss Lockie had opened
the first Women’s Institute at Macedon, which can therefore claim to be
the oldest branch of the Association. Its first demonstration was given the
next month by Mrs. Henrietta Walker, who was so well-beloved of country
women. Till her death in 1937, she travelled far and wide over Victoria
demonstrating, giving her services _ free. Mrs. Walker could go to an
apathetic meeting and, in a few minutes, convert it into a most enthusiastic
one, with her bright personality and her samples of rugs and baskets. She
originated the hooked rug and bark basketry crafts, which are still so popular.
Later Miss Evelyn Syme, Miss Ellison Spowers, and Miss A. Russell
joined the Committee. Institutes had been formed at Gisborne, Flinders,
Beaconsfield Upper, Kallista, and Beaufort by August, which were run on
the lines of the English Women’s Institutes, and craft work, home industries and
lectures were encouraged. Macedon and Beaufort started at once to organize
Rest Rooms. A small craft exhibit was staged at the Royal Show that year.
Later on the Victoria League granted £250 to the Committee, which was
renamed the Women’s Institute Committee, Miss Evelyn Syme was Chair-
man, Miss Grice Honorary Secretary and Mrs. Morton Assistant Secretary.
Miss A. Knight represented the Department of Agriculture on it. A small
craft exhibit was again staged at the Royal Show in 1927, Macedon winning
the prize for the best entry. Crib Point was formed in April, 1928.
When the Country Women’s Association was formed in 1928, the
Institutes were advised by their Committee to join the Association, Macedon,
Flinders, Beaconsfield Upper, Kallista, Beaufort, Broadford and Crib Point
all did so. The Women’s Institute Committee was co-opted, and held its first
meeting as the Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee of the Country
Women’s Association on August 27th, 1928. Miss Elsa Grice became Chair-
man, Miss Russell Honorary Secretary, and Mrs. Morton Assistant Secretary.
The following members were present: Lady Mitchell, State President j Lady
Masson, Mrs. Cave, Mrs. C. Brown, Mrs. Edwards, Mrs. Wark, Honorary
Secretary, Country Women’s Association; Miss Jessie Bage. Later Miss M.
Speeding became Honorary Treasurer. Miss Chisholm represented the Depart-
ment of Education, Miss A. Knight the Department of Agriculture. Miss
L. A. James, Mrs. A. P. Derham (representing Arts and Crafts Society), Mrs.
W. Holman and Mrs. Henrietta Walker were also elected.

This Committee was entrusted with the organizing of demonstrations
and lectures at branch meetings, most of its members were craftswomen and
the Departments of Education and Agriculture promised full co-operation
through their representatives, as did the Arts and Crafts Society through
theirs.
The Department of Agriculture made no charge for Miss Knight’s ser-
vices and she was the first to tour the Mallee, demonstrating jam-making
and fruit bottling. She and her sister must have travelled over Victoria many
times on their different tours. In addition, they were always ready to help
with advice and gave up a great deal of time to judging both in the country
and at the Handicraft Exhibitions.
In that first year the Craft Library was started with a gift of books
from Miss Grice. Finance was a great problem, for the cost of sending
out demonstrators was considerable. In October it was proposed by Miss
Ellison Spowers, and seconded by Mrs. Larking, that “It be resolved that
the present Endowment Fund, consisting of the Wilson Trust £3OO and £SO
from Miss Grice, be held as the nucleus of an Endowment Fund and that the
income from investments of that Fund be credited to the Ordinary Account
and then made available by the Honorary Treasurer to the Handicraft and
Home Industries Committee for Branch work.” Interest on this was £24 a
year, beyond this the Committee had no income. Next month the Executive
Committee of the Association granted the Handicrafts and Home Industries
Committee £2O, and later the Victoria League donated £SO. When the annual
Country Week (later called Annual Effort) was inaugurated the Committee
received a proportion, at first only 10%, but now it is 50%. That and the
interest from the £350 is the Committee’s only “unearned increment,” the
remainder of its income has always been earned, by exhibitions, door money,
commission (2d. in the l/-) on sales, entry fees, etc. Any surplus money
is used to increase help for the branches by paying portion of the cost of
tours, etc.
Proficiency Certificates for demonstrators were inaugurated and the first
Annual Report records the organizing of 26 demonstrations and twelve lec-
tures for branchesj subjects were much the same as now, rug-making, basketry,
dressmaking, millinery, toys, etc. i
The Chairman, Miss Grice, in her foreword to the Report, said: “Passing,
as some of us have done, from Women’s Institutes or New Settlers League to
Country Women’s Association membership, we bring with us that special heri


tage, a right community spirit. The Country Women’s Association is sowing
the seed of this spirit in many places—in urging the development of
handicrafts and home industries, we do not want selfishness, nor the exclusion
of other work and interests which may be more urgent or important, nor do
we want to be dull education agents. We want to help the building up of new
industries by the passing on of knowledge, and to cultivate a better sense of
beauty and higher ideals to brighten our lives. ‘lf you know a good thing, pass
it on’ is an old Women’s Institute saying, so we want all to know and
pass on their knowledge to help others, even if they themselves do not
benefit.”
In these past 21 years Miss Grice’s ideals have been largely realized.
Groups share expenses of demonstrators’ tours, large branches help smaller ones.
The time and energy she gave to her work have been well repaid, for she has
seen a widespread and complex organization built up.
The Committee was indeed fortunate in its early leaders. Mrs. Oswald
Syme, Chairman 1932-3 and 1935-6, herself a craftswoman and an able
organizer, was an enthusiast for beauty, simplicity and fine workmanship.
Her good taste helped the Committee to set a standard and encourage work of
artistic merit or practical value in preference to small crafts which were easy,
but of little worth. She gave up a great deal of time to planning and arrang-
ing the Exhibitions and to judging in the country.
Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald, also a good organizer, has always demanded a
high standard and has given much time and thought to all her work. As well
as doing so much arranging, etc., for the Handicraft Exhibitions, she has
visited many branches and judged at their shows. When war came she skilfully
turned the energies of branches, as well as of the general public, to making-
camouflage nets, sheepskin vests for airmen, and quilts and woollies for
British children. She was Honorary Secretary of the Yarra Branch in 1929
and its Treasurer the following year, then Chairman of the Handicrafts and
Home Industries Committee 1933-5, and 1940-3, and Central Vice-President
1943-6, and State Vice-President 1946-8.
Lady Sewell was Chairman for three years, 1937-40, and Honorary
Secretary for six years, and has been Editor of Country Crafts since
1944. She held the same high ideals and added her own special contri-
bution to the already wide range of activities, the Choral and Dramatic
Competitions.
Mrs. Fred Bird, who was a member of the Committee till 1937, did a
great deal towards establishing the craft of weaving j in 1933 she gave the
Committee a blue-print for a loom. When Mrs. A. Stringer, of Ensay, wanted
to take up weaving, the Committee paid her fare to Melbourne, and Mrs. Bird
gave her lessons. It must have been a combination of a good teacher and an
apt pupil, for Mrs. Stringer has won many prizes since. The Committee lent
Mrs. Stringer a loom, which is still in the Ensay district.
Mrs. Edwards succeeded Miss Speeding as Treasurer. Mrs. Morton was


deeply interested in her work as Assistant Secretary to the Committee j she
had endless difficulties to contend with in the organizing of demonstrations
and tours, because there was no co-operation between branches in those days,
nor were there any country members on the Committee. It was of immense
benefit to the work when Country Vice-Presidents joined it, and now the
Group Presidents provide a most valuable link between the branches and the
Committee. Mrs. Morton was tactful, patient and persistent, a very useful
combination for a secretary. Her most notable work was the organizing of
demonstrations for the Wool Train on its two tours.
The first Exhibition was held in the Upper Town Hall and opened by
Lady Creswell. It was fitting that Flinders should be the first name on the
Branch Cup (presented by Mrs. Fraser) for Mrs. Larking, at that time their
President, has been an inspiration to craft workers throughout the Association,
as well as an eminently sensible counsellor on the Executive Council on which
she has served for 17 years. She has a wide knowledge of, and much skill in
craft work, and has done a great deal of demonstrating, especially in rush seat-
ing and fine needlework and quilting, as well as judging, both in town and
country. The Permanent Craft Exhibit owes much of its finest work to her.
It was soon realized that the standard of judging at country shows was
very uneven, and to set a standard “Points for Judging” were drawn up for use
in branches and at the Handicraft Exhibition.
In July, 1930, the Repertory Society staged a play at Berwick at the
request of the Officer and Beaconsfield Upper Branches. In November Miss
Russell and Mrs. Morton visited Sale, Traralgon, and Yallourn to display
craft work and discuss the organization of tours for demonstrators j they also
visited Geelong, where Mrs. Morton spoke at a meeting organized bv Miss
Sleep.
The question of publishing a magazine was first discussed in October,
1930. In December, with the approval of the Executive, the first number
of Country Crafts appeared, financed with a private donation of £25. That first
number was printed on pinkish paper and boasted eight pages j the second
issue was on white paper and had 20 pages, the third one 32. since when it
has fluctuated. Miss E. Ramsay was engaged as Editor, but resigned in January
to take up an appointment at the Austin Hospital. Miss Russell then under-
took the work with much diffidence and a complete lack of experience j it was


largely due to the kindness and patience of the printers, Messrs. J. and N.
Haase, that she was able to carry on. Finance was a difficulty at first, but the
magazine, in spite of some anxious moments, always supported itself, and later
was able to contribute £SO a year towards the salary of the Secretary of the
Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee. It received much kindly sup-
port, some branches sent in donations and Mrs. Humphrey Clegg gave the
block for the cover which was used for seme years j it had a map of Victoria
and a border of kangaroos. In 1937 Mr. Harold Herbert very generously gave
us the design which is in use now, Mrs. Sargood kindly paying for the neces-
sary block.
Now the magazine has a circulation of 10,000, there is plenty of material
available to fill more pages, but paper rationing prevents any expansion.
In January, 1931, Miss Russell accompanied Mrs. Waller to Gippsland
when branches were opened at Bairnsdale, Orbost, Benambra and Swifts
Creek, craft work was shown and the work of the Committee explained. In
March Mrs. Morton and Miss Russell went to Meeniyan and to Fish Creek
where a new branch was formed. Mrs. Morton visited a number of branches
in the course of her work. About this time Miss Butchart joined the Com-
mittee and is still a member. She is an expert spinner and weaver and dyer,
and has given most valuable assistance to the Committee, and her kindly
interest and advice has helped many a craft worker. During Wool Week that
year a display was arranged in Myer’s window and aroused great interest.
The 1931 Exhibition was held in the Kelvin Hall in September, entries
were less numerous than the previous year, but the standard was better. The
great event of 1932 was the Exhibition and Mannequin Parade in the Town
Hall during Wool Week which was undertaken at the request of the Graziers’
Society, which took full financial responsibility. The various uses of wobl were
demonstrated and there was a Loan Exhibition of articles made of wool which
was arranged by Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald; Mrs. Oswald Syme was respon-
sible for the Mannequin Parade, at which some beautiful clothes were
displayed, including a wedding dress of wool lace. The Yarra Branch and
Younger Set provided helpers, many of the Younger Set acting as mannequins.
The attendance of 20,000 people brought in door money amounting to £420;
this enabled the Committee to give more assistance to branches; in addition,
£BO was paid into the Somers House Debt Account and a further £BO to
General Funds.
Mrs. Heaton Clark was now Honorary Treasurer to the Committee, a
position she still holds; in addition to being an elected member of the Central
Executive since 1943, she was a Central Vice-President in 1942, 1945, 1946.
Her service to the Association has been outstanding, calm and unruffled, she
has kept the financial skeins of the Handicrafts and Home Industries Com-
mittee untangled, and even the flurry of an Exhibition and its innumerable small
transactions and individual sales accounts fail to worry her. Not many people
realize the hours of work she has given to her numerous accounts j in addition

to all this, for years she allowed a working party to meet at her house every
month to pack and despatch the magazine, and she even provided a saucepan
full of specially powerful home-brewed paste for the paper wrappers.
No mention of our accounts would be complete without reference to Mr.
W. F. Rowe, who was our first auditor and organized our system of book-keep-
ing. In addition, since 1935 he has audited all the accounts of the Association,
taking this over from David Fell & Co., the first Association Auditors. The
audit has now become a considerable task involving weeks of work for which he
charges a very nominal fee.
He acts as returning officer at our Annual Elections in a voluntary capacity
and we are indeed appreciative of his help and advice which he has generously
given over many years.
Mrs. lan Currie, of Euroa, realizing the value of demonstrations at
branch meetings, donated £25 for demonstrators’ fares. This sum was made
the nucleus of a fund for that purpose.
In May, 1933, the Wool Train, with a team of six demonstrators under
the charge of Mrs. Morton, visited 15 centres and was seen by 4,308 people.
The Wool Week Committee, under whose auspices the train was sent, were
very pleased with the result. Mrs. Peake (soft toys), Mrs. Bailey (dress-
making), Miss Butchart (spinning), Mrs. Veitch (weaving), Miss Roadie
(gloves), Miss Stewart (quilt and mattress making) were the demonstrators.
Birregurra, Colac, Camperdown, Terang, Warrnambool, Port Fairy, Hamil-
ton, Ararat, Stawell, Murtoa, Horsham, Dimboola, Kaniva, Nhill, and
Beaufort were visited. A charge of 3d. was made for admittance to the cars;
the tour resulted in a profit of £37/16/2 for the Committee, which paid the
money into the fund for demonstrators’ tours.
To help members find a market for their work, a shop was organized in
a Collins Street building in November, 1932 5 the Committee took its usual
commission of 2d. in the 1 /-, and paid £3ll to sellers.
Following a visit from Miss V. McMillan, of the Home Science Exten-
sion Bureau of the Otago University in New Zealand, the Committee decided
to use the Box System of teaching for outlying branches. The Bureau kindly
sent a box of children’s clothes over on loan. The box contained an illustrated
lecture and samples of work in varying stages; this was copied and proved so
successful that Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald donated one on Infant Welfare,
and later dressmaking and gloving boxes were added.


A shop was held again in 1934 in the Lower Town Hall; this time nearly
£4OO was paid to members for their work.
By now the Group System was in operation, Group Presidents were ex-
officio members of the Committee, and proved a most valuable link with the
ever-increasing number of branches. Tours organized on a Group basis cost the
branches less and saved much work in the office.
Annual Exhibitions were held from 1935 till the war, members could
still sell their work, provided it was of a suitable standard, work gaining less
than 50% either for sale or competition, was not shown.
After eight years of valuable service Mrs. Morton resigned in 1934,
great changes had taken place in that period, and she had the satisfaction of
seeing her strenuous work in the early days bearing fruit. Miss Strong was
appointed in her place and held the position till she became General Secretary
of the Association. She was an enthusiast, who never spared herself, combining
a clear head and good sense with a calm temperament. The turmoil of un-
packing and arranging at the Exhibitions, the barrage of questions fired at her
from all sides, only brought a glint of pleasurable excitement to her eye. Her
unfailing courtesy was appreciated by all.
Miss Isobel Macdonald who had recently retired from the headmistress-
ship of a large girls’ school in South Australia, joined the Committee. She
did a great deal of travelling through the branches, being much sought after
as a lecturer. The Honorary Secretary and Editor of Country Crafts , Miss
Russell, was away in England in 1935 and during her absence Mrs. R. T. A.
McDonald acted as Honorary Secretary and Miss Macdonald as Editor, and
Miss Strong became Magazine Secretary. On Miss Russell’s return at the
end of the year, Miss Macdonald became Sub-Editor of the magazine and
greatly improved its standard. Her monthly contribution, “Our Little World,”
still gives pleasure to its readers, though failing eyesight forced her to relin-
quish office as Sub-Editor recently.
Other States were interested in the progress of the Handicrafts Com-
mittee, a craft exhibit went to Tasmania, and in 1936 Mrs. Larking was invited
to attend the Annual Conference of the Country Women’s Association of New
South Wales at Orange, to explain the work of the Committee and to demon-
strate. Our Permanent Craft Exhibit went to Adelaide in 1935 for their
Centenary Exhibition, and following a request made by Mrs. Watt, President
of the Associated Country Women of the World, a collection of crafts using
natural resources went to London in March, 1937. Another exhibit was sent
to the Empire Exhibition at Glasgow.
Every encouragement was given to the use of wool in spinning, weaving,
quilts, mattresses, hooked rugs, etc. A considerable quantity of scoured wool
was sold for mattresses and quilts, and carded wool was very popular for
quilts; one account for wool purchased from Messrs. Dalgety & Co. was for
£134. The Committee was represented on the Wool Week Committee first
by Mrs. Morton, then by Miss Strong.


Mrs. Colquhoun (formerly Miss Russell) resigned as Honorary Secre-
tary in 1937, but continued to edit the magazine. Miss Estelle Brett was
appointed Honorary Secretary.
Note
Mrs. Leslie Colquhoun (Miss Anne Russell) was one of the outstanding
leaders of the early days of the C.W.A.
She was a member of the Committee of the Victoria League, which became
the Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee of the C.W.A. and was
its first Honorary Secretary j an office she held during the formative years
of the Association. She was largely responsible for the organization of the
Exhibitions and for the high standards set from the very start. It was during
her term of office that the magazine came into being, Mrs. Colquhoun financ-
ing its beginning and editing it until 1944. When not editing or sub-editing it,
she has collected material for it, “made it up,” a more laborious and thankless
task than editing. All this she has done so unobtrusively that many present
members scarcely know her name.
In the early days of the Association Mrs. Colquhoun drove speakers and
the Organizing Secretary to the Mallee, the Western District and other parts
of the State and was one of the original trustees and guarantors for Somers
House.
The whole Association owes her a very large debt for her able work,
which still continues.
That year the beautiful craft exhibit from the Warwickshire Federation
of Women’s Institutes was shown at our Exhibition and greatly admired. We
received permission to copy it. Mrs. Arnold Caddy paid for the samples which
were bought, Mrs. Larking and Mrs. Campbell gave theirs free, Dr. Leslie
Colquhoun made a wooden case and stands for the work, and the Committee
acquired a beautiful exhibit, which has since travelled far and wide.
The annual Exhibitions were attracting more and more attention, over
6,100 people attending in 1937. Much time and thought were given to their
arrangement, especially by Mrs. Oswald Syme and Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald.
To single out articles specially approved by the Committee, Green Stars are
awarded now by the Judging Committee. Only a few are given each year for
articles of outstanding workmanship, value, usefulness and/or originality and/or
beauty. They are much prized, not only because a Green Star carries an extra
100 points in the counting for the branch cups.
The Fraser (Branch Community Work) and the Syme (Group Com-
munity Work) Cups are awarded by the Judging Committee. The three
Branch Cups are awarded on the points gained by all the entries from each
branch, one goes to branches with a membership over 60, one to branches with
membership of 31-60, the third to small branches with membership of 30 and
under. There is also the Sargood Cup for the Younger Set gaining the highest


points and another for Younger Set Community Work. The much-prized Cup
for the Finest Individual Exhibit is awarded by the Judging Committee on
the recommendation of the sectional judges. The winners’ names are engraved
on the cups each year and they retain a replica of the Cup. Community
Exhibits have always attracted a great deal of attention, and they have helped
to weld the branches and groups together.
Here are the names on the Cups:

gurra, 1937 Warracknabeal, 1938 Birregurra, 1939 Geelong, 1948 Croydon.

Sargood Cup , Younger Sets: 1938 Officer, 1939 Echuca, 1948 Nhill.
In 1938 Miss E. Brett resigned and Mrs. Heaton Clark consented to
act as temporary Honorary Secretary in her place. Mrs. L. E. B. Stretton,
who was an elected member of the Committee, later became Honorary Secre-
tary. That year the Exhibition realized a profit of £l7O, and there were 3,000
entries from 100 branches. Mrs. Lionel Weatherley and Mrs. G. Norris were
elected to the Committee in 1938. The magazine had now increased its circu-
lation to 4,600, an increase of 21% in a year, and showed a credit balance
of £25/16/5. Miss Ruth Scott was appointed Secretary in place of Miss
Strong, who became General Secretary. Already branches were giving up more
and more time to First Aid classes and Red Cross work, and by September,
1939, the Committee had to decide how it should suit its activities to war-time
conditions. The Chairman, Mrs. Sewell (now Lady Sewell) gave the lead by
saying that the work must be carried on, and that the Association should stand
for “sanity, selflessness and subordination.”
Though the Exhibition planned for 1940 was cancelled, demonstrations
were continued and many lessons in spinning and weaving were given by Miss
Butchart, Miss Grieve and Mrs. McLeish. The cancellation of the Exhibition
involved a loss of £6O, and Mrs. Sargood generously made this good. Mrs.
R. T. A. McDonald succeeded Lady Sewell as Chairman. The Committee
much regretted the death of Mrs. R. G. Beggsj she was an enthusiastic member
till her death and a skilled craftswoman. A Display of C.W.A. War Work
was arranged in Conference Week.

Realizing that many members in remoter areas would be glad of advice
about work for wounded and fighting men, the Committee inaugurated a
Country Women’s Association Patriotic Comforts Fund for distribution and
collection of work. To ensure clear and simple directions of how the work
should be done, a booklet, the C.W.A. War Workers ’ W oolcraft, was issued
—the Australian Wool Board generously paying the first cost of printing. The
three fighting services—Army, Navy and Air Force —were consulted about
their special needs and all patterns were tested before being included. Three
editions were issued, 5,000, 2,500 and 5,000. Its activities were greatly in-
creased as the years went by. Macrame twine was made into minesweepers’
gloves, and many branches provided their own Wool for knitted garments,
some of it hand-spun. Indeed, the hand-spun, hand-knitted greasy wool pull-
overs and long stockings became one of the special features of this Fund.
In the desire to make meetings a place of rest and relaxation for mem-
bers distressed and overworked with war efforts, branches endeavoured to
make their programmes bright and attractive, so demonstrations and com-
petitions —strictly utilitarian and practical—were arranged and music and play
readings encouraged. The Musical and Dramatic Sub-Committe/e owes its
existence to the foresight and understanding of Lady Sewell, who stressed the
need for an all-round programme of activities to be encouraged by the
Association. Formed in 1939, musical and dramatic activities made good pro-
gress and branches were encouraged to borrow sets of plays and music from
the H. and H.I. library. I
The first Choral Competition in 1939, held during Annual Conference
Week was won by Horsham, which was again the winning choir the next year;
while Boronia was the winner of the first One-Act Play Competition held in
1940.
Although branches continued to form new choirs and to enjoy play read-
ings, transport difficulties and the fact that women were undertaking more and
more outside work proved too great a hardship to enable the competitions
to be continued during 1943 and 1944. It was not till 1947 that the years
of encouragement and work by the Committee resulted in a spread of interest
through the branches, culminating in a successful Festival of Music and One-
Act Plays. Nothing succeeds like success. The 1948 Festival proved this old
adage, and it is hoped that, in the future, this Festival will expand into some-
thing very large and worthwhile. The energy and enthusiasm of Mrs. J. R.
Richards, m.a., have been the mainspring of this Festival.


In addition to her work as Honorary Assistant Treasurer for three years
and the work entailed in organizing the Festival, she has broadcast regularly
for the Association. Her three years as Group President, South-Western
Group, and her work at Headquarters, have given her a very thorough know-
ledge of the Association.
A great deal of spinning and weaving was achieved both in the branches
and in town during 1943. The Committee had spinning attachments made,
and these were sold as fast as they were made, many going to other States.
They were fortunate in buying at very small cost 1,000 spools from the
Lincoln Mills, which were used with the spinning attachments.
Mrs. Colquhoun resigned her position as Editor of Country Crafts and
Lady Sewell took her place. Mrs. A. C. Bennett was Chairman that year, in
spite of transport difficulties, the number of demonstrations increased slightly,
and austerity cooking was a very popular one. Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald gave a
prize for a song for children and a cradle song; these were won by Miss
Turnbull, of Wedderburn, and Mrs. Venters Young, of Stonehaven, respec-
tively. Spinning and weaving were displaved at the 1943 Conference. During
Mrs. Goucher’s year as Chairman very few demonstrations could be arranged,
travelling conditions were bad and many of our demonstrators were now
working in Heidelberg and other hospitals.
During the war the magazine suffered severely from paper rationing,
being reduced to only twelve pages at one stage, and its green cover disappeared.
However, various competitions were held, the “Ideal Farmstead” creating a
good deal of interest, and the Groups conducted one for the best stories about
a Group area, which the Mildura-Millewa Group won.
Mrs. G. Norris became Chairman during the difficult transition from war
to peace. The Committee made a great effort to arouse new interests by
planning its first Craft School and the first post-war Exhibition. Mrs. Donald-
son succeeded Lady Sewell as Honorary Secretary. Those six years during
which Lady Sewell was Honorary Secretary were the most difficult ones the
Committee had ever faced, and since 1944 she had also been Editor of Country
Crafts. Her unflagging interest and good judgment were of inestimable value
to the whole Association, especially during the war; she continues her long


record of service to country women as Editor of the magazine and as a member
of the Executive and the Handicrafts and Home Industries Committee, as
well as serving on several other Committees, such as the Agenda and the
Scholarship Committees.
The Craft School at Somers House in September, 1947, was a success, 37
members attending classes in glove-making, book-binding, basketry and
weaving. t .
The Exhibition was held the following month in the Lower Town
Hall} entries were less numerous than in pre-war days, but the stan-
dard was good. It helped to rouse everybody to the change from war work to
peace-time ploys, and it should have been an education to the many new
branches formed since 1939. Alas there was a transport strike, very few people
could get to town, the attendance was very small and it resulted in a monetary
loss. .
Mrs. R. R. Taylor became Chairman in 1947 when the interest m crart
work was rapidly reviving} her wide knowledge of craft work and her willing-
ness to help in all matters have been of great value to the Committee. To
meet the demand for more demonstrators for the country, two Craft Schools
were held. The first was at Somers House in July, when basketry and gloving
were taught, the following month another was held in Camperdown at the
suggestion of Mrs. Weatherley} basketry and papier mache were the subjects.
An Exhibit of Craftwork was taken by the leader of the Australian
delegation, Mrs. Hicken, to the Amsterdam Conference of the Associated
Country Women of the World. It contained many fine articles, mostly made
from natural resources, wool, flax, rushes, skins, etc. On her return to England
Mrs. Hicken lent it to Mrs. Guy Innes, who displayed it at many Women’s
Institute meetings. < . <
The Local History Competition in the magazine aroused much interest.
The 48 entries so impressed the Historical Society of Victoria, who were the
judges, that they asked permission to keep them for their records. Mary L.
Baxter was the winner with a History of Casterton.
When there was such a shortage of demonstrators during the war the
Craft Library was a great help to country members. It was now recatalogued
and new books were added. Mrs. Taylor reconditioned the Craft Exhibit in
the Home Science Van, making several new samples for it. Dr. Leslie Col-
quhoun made a dozen stands and two wooden boxes to pack them} these
greatly facilitate the display of work at the meetings.
Miss Ruth Scott resigned to be married, after being nine years with the
Association, the last four years as Secretary to the Committee. _ She was a
most industrious worker, and never spared herself, especially during the war
when the handling of wool and garments for the branches involved a great
deal of extra work. She was succeeded by Mrs. Howard.
A most successful Exhibition was held in September, resulting in a
record profit of £230, and arousing widespread interest. It was heartening to


see so many new branches competing. The Wool Board gave £lO for prizes
in the section using wool. Sugar rationing caused a sad falling-off in the
produce section; there was scarcely any jam.
Much has been achieved in these 21 years. Though the Committee may
have appeared to have its head in the clouds, dreaming of fine work and
the possible creation of our own traditional designs, sweet-voiced choirs and
clever actresses, its feet have been firmly on the earth! All the domestic
virtues have been encouraged. Urged on by wartime shortages, great strides
have been made in the use of natural resources j weaving and spinning indus-
tries have been established in many districts.
Though so much has been achieved, there is an infinite number of
interesting possibilities for the future.
HONORARY MEMBERS
The highest distinction which the Association may confer on a member for
outstanding service to the Association is an Honorary Membership. Under the
constitution a 95% vote taken by secret vote at an Annual Conference is necessary
to elect the member nominated for this distinction and only one may be confer-
red in any one year while the number of Honorary members is limited to ten
at any one time.
Those whom the Association have so honoured are:
the late Lady Mitchell, c.b.e.,
the late Mrs. R. G. Beggs,
Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald,
Lady Sewell, m.a.,
Mrs. W. E. Sargood, j.p.

YOUNGER SETS
WE, the Younger Set members of today, feel a deep debt of gratitude to
the initial members of our Association; for it was only a few months after
the Victorian inception of this grand organization that the inaugural meeting
of the Younger Set was held at the home of Mrs. Pittendrigh, in Malvern
Road, South Yarra, on October 6th, 1928 —thus commencing the Yarra Branch
Younger Set.
The following year a branch was started at Corowa (Balldale) and
district.
In 1931 there were 17 sets and an annual meeting was held, as well as
a tennis tournament which realized £25/16/6.
In 1932 Yarra Branch helped with a Mannequin Parade, and from two
bridge parties, one at the home of Lady Clarke, the other at Lady Gepps’—
£5O was made.
So with 28 Sets the first informal Younger Set Conference was held
before the opening of the 1932 senior Conference in the Melbourne Town
Hall.
Also during the year 1932 a ball was held at Officer and an excellent
meeting at Shepparton. ,*
It was moved by Lady Mitchell at the Senior Conference in 1933 “That
Younger Sets shall nominate and elect annually a member of the Association
to represent them on the Executive Committee.” Mrs. L. Due was appointed
to this office, becoming the first State Representative. This was a very definite
forward step and emphasized the importance of the Younger Sets.
The same year a Conference of Younger Sets and Group Presidents was
held at the home of Mrs. J. S. Fraser, South Yarra.
In 1929 the Metropolitan Younger Sets sent £250 towards the initial
purchase of Somers House; they also sent donations to the Blind Institute in
Melbourne.
Younger Sets were first grouped in 1943 by Miss Betty Wolff, their
State Representative. /
Now in 1949 we have 99 Younger Set branches in Victoria. These are
in 17 Groups, each with a Group President. These girls under the capable
leadership of Miss Bott—the State Representative —hold an executive meeting
every three months in Melbourne.
The chief objectives of the Sets are the new Country Women’s Association
Club, Food and Fat for Britain, the Scholarship Fund, Clothes for Europe; and
many local appeals, as well as hospitals, Baby Health Centres and creches.
During the war we made camouflage nets and sheepskin vests, in fact, all
patriotic appeals were assisted. Our activities are numerous. Balls, moonlight
hikes, baby sitting, donations of rose trees for gardens, helping hospital staffs,
demonstrations, talks, oh! and hosts of other things to keep us busy.


Each year the Younger Setters have a week down at our Holiday Home,
Somers House, when approximately 50 girls get together for an enjoyable
and highly informative time. I
Our Annual Conference packs the Emily McPherson Hall in June of
each year, and here the spirit of the girls never ceases to amaze. These happy,
enthusiastic girls—future office-bearers and members of the senior branches —
are bound together by our lovely collect, our ideals and our motto.
We realize the responsibility of the growing Younger Sets and conduct
our meetings with dignity and efficiency.
So it is that from 1928 to 1949 —21 glorious years —we have, with the
guidance and help of our senior members, followed the high ideals of the
Association. We sincerely hope to work in the true international spirit of
Country Women of the World.

SOMERS HOUSE
AT the inaugural meeting to discuss the formation of the Country Women’s
Association, the late Sir James Barrett said that, when a movement such
as this is begun with more or less defined aims, you do not know where the
movement will end.
Less than a year after the Association’s beginning there is the first
mention of a Seaside Home. In the Annual Report of the 1930 Conference
the following appeared: “The continued droughts had made living conditions
in some country districts unbearable and it was decided to strain every effort
to establish a Seaside Home.” •
After much searching, “Wallaroy House,” at Black Rock, was thought
suitable and was bought at a cost of £2,480. Mrs. J. S. Fraser, Mrs. Oswald
Syme and Miss Russell (now Mrs. Colquhoun) were appointed Trustees, while
Mrs. Staughton, Mrs. Syme, Miss Grice and Miss Russell became guarantors
for a loan. The Younger Set of the Yarra Branch, by enthusiasm and hard


work, raised the deposit, money to defray more than a quarter of the cost
was raised in that first year. ,
At last the opening day, November 28th, arrived j 129 heard Lady Somers
formally open the Home, to which she allowed her name to be given.
Mrs. Brodie was appointed Matron and the first guests arrived. Since then
thousands of members have spent happy holidays at Somers House.
In February, 1934, extra land was bought and again in 1936 the block
at the side was added to the property. For some time the idea of an extra wing
was a dream for the future until Mrs. J. S. Fraser offered to finance the build-
ing. This was gratefully accepted by the committee and in October, 1935, the
Jessie Fraser wing was opened by Lady Huntingfield with a gold key inset
with the badge at the top.
In 1939 a further block of seven single rooms was added, thus increas-
ing the comfort of members without children.
In 1942, after Japan had entered the war against the Allies and there
was a danger of invasion, Somers House was not used so extensively by the
members. It was decided to offer the home for the use of some other organiza-
tion. The Victorian Auxiliary for Evacuees from the East accepted the offer
and used the Home for a year. It was then lent to the Y.W.C.A. as a hostel
for Service Women.
In December, 1945, Somers House was handed back to the Association
and Mrs. Winstone was appointed Matron and held that position until Nov-
ember, 1948.
Mention must be made of the House Committee which has so faithfully
looked after the needs of Somers House from Mrs. Horden, the first Chair-
woman, down to Mrs. Wilson, the present holder of that position and the
various members of that Committee.
From about 100 visitors a year, Somers House has accommodated up to
1,100 visitors. So popular is the home that Groups in the Association are
working to buy blocks of land both in the country and at the seaside so that,
nearer to their branches, there will be other homes for members to go for
relaxation and rest. Beside the Ocean Grove seaside cottage, acquired two
years ago, a cottage has been bought for the Gippsland Hills Group and
opened for use this year.


GROUP PRESIDENTS
The Association owes a great debt of gratitude to those members who
over the years have undertaken the office of Group President. To them has
fallen the task of organizing in the country, of welding their branches into
groups, and groups into one united Association.
In her own area each one represents the State Executive, and conversely
is the representative of her group on the Executive. So it behoves her to know
her branches and to understand their points of view, that she may speak for
them and voice their opinions and their needs.
To this end she is always in close contact with her branches, she travels
extensively and her correspondence is limitless j and always she is alert to form
new branches and gain new members.
As she is the contact between her branches and Executive, it is important
that she attends Executive meetings and makes herself conversant with the
activities of the Association as a whole.
She and her fellow Group Presidents form the greater part of the State
Executive and through her every part of the State and every member has a
voice in deciding the policy of the Association.
Many fine women have held the position of Group President j some at the
end of their two years of office returning to help branches as ordinary mem-
bers, some becoming high executive officers of the Association, but all furthering
the aims and ideals of the Association.
