PREPACE.
Every Mail from the Eastern Colonies brings a number of
letters from intending immigrants and others, addressed to me,
asking for information respecting the Colony.
To afford the required knowledge, in a concise form, is the
object of these “ Notes on Western Australia,” which it is hoped
may prove of some use to the class for whose benefit I have written
them.

Western Australia on 31st December, 1883.
Western Australia is about one third of the Australian Con-
tinent, and comprises all that portion lying to the Westward of the
129th Meridian of East Longitude. Its area is about a million
square miles, and is therefore about eight times the size of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT.
The constitution is what is called “Representative.” The
Governor is appointed by the Crown and is assisted by an
Executive Council, appointed also by the Crown, consisting of the
Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Colonial Treasurer,
the Director of Public Works and Commissioner of Railways, and
the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Surveyor General. There
is a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive
Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 4 nominees
of the Governor, and 16 elected members. This Council is pre-
sided over by a Speaker.
The franchise for electors is £lOO freehold, or householders
of =£lo annual value, or lessees of Crown Lands to the saipe amount
annual rent. The qualification for members is the possession of
<£looo freehold beyond encumbrances.
There are 18 electoral Districts, —Perth, Fremantle, and the
North District return two members each, and the remaining Dis-
tricts one member each.
POPULATION.
The population is only 81,700, and is generally scattered along
the whole seaboard and within 100 miles of it. In a few cases,
however, settlement extends nearly 300 miles inland.
PRODUCTS.
The principal products are wool, timber, lead, copper, pearls,
pearl shells, wheat and other cereals, guano, sandalwood, wine,


fruits, horses, cattle, &c., &c. The export of wool for 1888 was
valued at ,£225,279, timber £79,760, lead ore £7,266, pearls and
pearl shells £47,625, sandalwood £56,250, and horses £11,350.
PASTORAL.
To the north of latitude 28° South, the country is used almost
exclusively for pasturage, and is eminently suited for horses, cattle,
and sheep. The largest squatting properties are now to be found
in the Northern districts of the Colony; and pastoral pursuits are
successfully followed by enterprising colonists. The estimated value
of the export of wool for 1883 was £225,279, the average price
being Is. 2d. per pound.
The Southern portion of the Colony is suited not only for
pasturage but also for the growth of cereals, and most other extra-
tropical products.
TIMBER.
The Colony is celebrated for its timber and especially for the
Eucalyptus Marginata, locally called “ Jar rah.” This timber is
almost inexhaustible, and is celebrated for piles for jetties, wharfs,
and bridges, for buildings, railway sleepers, and all purposes
requiring durability and imperviousness to the white ant and the
teredo navalis. It is an ea£y wood to work and is in request for all
purposes of engineering and building throughout Australia, New
Zealand, and in India.
The Karri, Eucalyptus diversicolor, abounds along the south
coast, west of Albany, and grows to a magnificent size. It is very
highly spoken of and obtains a place with the Jarrah in South
Australia and elsewhere for all engineering purposes.
During 1883 the export of timber was 19,940 loads, estimated
value being £79,760, or an average of about £4 a load.
There are a great many other woods, Eucalypts, Banksias,
and. Acacias, which are very valuable for certain purposes. A
description of these timbers is given in Baron von Mueller’s excellent
work on “Forest Resources of Western Australia, 1879.”
MINERALS.
In the neighborhood of Northampton, and in other localities,
splendid lodes of lead and copper are found, and have been for
many years worked on a limited scale. During 1883, only 1038


tons of lead were exported, the estimated value being £,7266, or
about £7 per ton. Owing to the depressed state of the lead
market, the industry is at present not in a flourishing condition,
but if the price improves, the supply seems almost inexhaustible.
A railway connects Northampton with its seaport, Geraldton, a
distance of 34 miles.
PEARLS AND PEARL-SHELLS.
All along the north-western coast to the north of latitude 26°
South, the pearl oyster abounds, and pearls and pearl-shells are
obtained by native divers. The industry is a very remunerative
one, and the value of the export for 1883 was £47,625, viz.,
pearl-shells ,£30,125, the average price being £125 a ton, and
pearls £17,500, estimated value. The coast north of King Sound
has scarcely been as yet examined for this industry, but there is no
doubt that vast treasures of pearls and pearl shells exist between
there and our Eastern boundary.
WHEAT AND CEREALS.
During the last few years the small population of the Colony
has had so many outlets for its energy, in the prosecution of the
timber industry, pastoral pursuits in the new districts to the North,
pearl fisheries, &c., that there have not been sufficient people left to
conduct the cultivation of the soil. As a consequence, cultivation
and farming employments, being the least tempting and requiring
the greatest amount of manual labor, have had the least attention.
With increase of population, liberal land laws, and improved
means of communication, there is a certainty that the cultivation of
the soil will proceed, and as there is abundance of land in the
Central Districts of the Colony suited for the growth of cereals,
there is little doubt but that the industry can and will be followed
with advantage. There are at present 58,111 acres of land under
cultivation, and the yield per acre for 1883 was, wheat 13 bushels,
barley 16 bushels, oats 17 bushels, hay 1 ton, potatoes 3 tons.
Agriculture is confined entirely to the portion of the Colony South
of Latitude 28° S.
GUANO.
Licenses to remove deposits of guano existing on any island
within the territory can be obtained from the Commissioner of


Crown Lands; the ordinary royalty is 13s. per ton on the registered
tonnage of the ship. A reward of 10 per cent, of the amount
actually received by the Government as royalty will be paid to
the discoverer of any new deposits, over 2,000 tons, during five
years after the discovery and report.
SANDALWOOD.
The sandalwood tree, Santalum Cygnorum, has a wide range
throughout South-Western Australia, A large export has hitherto
gone on annually, that for 1883 being about 7,031 tons, estimated
value being =£56,250, or an average of about <£B a ton. It is by no
means an inexhaustible product, but the export will continue for
several years to come.
WINE.
The vine grows luxuriantly throughout the Southern portions
of the Colony, and it is merely a question of planting, to ensure an
abundant crop of grapes. Owing to the small population and the
numerous industries requiring attention, there are but few large
vineyards; but as population increases, there will no doubt be a
large export of wine and raisins, &c.
FRUITS
Fruits thrive well, and are easily grown. The following are
among those most commonly seen: —Apples, pears, apricots, nectar-
ines, peaches, grapes, figs, plums, mulberries, quinces, almonds,
guavas, currants, English and Cape gooseberries, oranges, lemons,
citrons, bananas, strawberries, loquats, pomegranates, olives, melons,
&c., &c.
HORSES AND CATTLE.
The number of horses exported during 1883 was 908, and the
estimated value was =£11,350, or an average of <£l2 10s. each.
During the last 20 years, horse-breeding has been neglected, owing
to its not being considered remunerative, but recently more atten-
tion is being given to it, and especially in the Northern portion of
the Colony, and it seems pretty certain that the Indian Market will
in the future look to North-Western Australia for its principal
supply. Horses and cattle thrive well everywhere throughout the
Colony.


LAND REGULATIONS.
The head of the department of lands is the Commissioner of
Crown Lands, who also is Surveyor General of the Colony. The
Land Revenue, from all sources, during 1883, amounted to <£98,798.
The Colony is divided into five land districts, viz., Central,
Central-Eastern, South-Eastern, North, and Kimberley ; the limits
of these districts are shown on the accompanying map.
In the Central or Home District, lands are alienated to first
applicant at 10s. an acre, in lots of any size not less than 40 acres,
except for garden purposes, when as little as 10 acres can be bought,
or on Special Occupation, with certain improvements, by annual
instalments for 10 years of Is. an acre. When the improvements,
which consist of fencing the whole and cropping one quarter, are
completed, and 10s. an acre is paid, a Crown Grant issues; but
until the improvements are completed the annual instalments of Is.
an acre must be continued even after the full 10s. has been paid.
The minimum size of blocks under Special Occupation is 100
acres; there is no maximum. Free selection before survey is per-
mitted. Crown Lands are leased for pasture in the Central District
in blocks of not less than 10,000 acres, to the first applicant at
£1 per thousand acres, and on annual license for areas not less
than 1,000 acres, at the same rate. The termination of all leases in
this district takes place at end of 1887.
In the Central-Eastern, South-Eastern, and North District
lands are sold in blocks of not less than 400 acres, at 6s. an acre,
and are leased for pasture at 6s. per thousand acres for the first
half, and 10s. per thousand acres for the second half of the lease, in
blocks of not less than 20,000 acres, and all such leases terminate
at the end of 1893.
In the Kimberley District land is sold at 10s. an acre to first
applicant, in blocks of not less than 200 acres, and leased for pasture
at 10s. per thousand acres, in blocks of not less than 50,000 acres
on frontages, and 20,000 acres where there is no frontage. Leases
in this district terminate also at the end of 1893. A Stocking
Clause provides that one head of large stock or ten head of sheep
for every one thousand acres held by a Lessee shall be kept in the
district after the first four years of the lease, or double rent paid
until such time as the required number of stock are within the
district. In the event of the required number of stock not being
in the district at the end of 7 years, the lease will be forfeited.


New Regulations will be proclaimed before 1887 for the Central
District, and befoi-e 1893 for all other Districts.
Purchasers of land are required to pay lessees the actual value
of any improvements on the land purchased.
Town Lands are sold by public auction, the upset price being
fixed by the Government.
Timber. —Licenses to cut timber are issued at ss. a month for
each man employed. Special licenses, at =£2o per annum for each
640 acres, are also issued. To encourage timber companies on a
large scale, special concessions are given.
Minerals. —Leases for areas not less than 20 acres are
granted for 7 years, on certain conditions, at a rental of ss. an
acre, and the land can be purchased by the lessee at =£3 an acre,
provided certain machinery has been erected, and that the mine has
been properly worked.
LAND TRANSFER ACT.
This Act, sometimes known as the “ Torrens Act,” has been
in force several years, and is of great importance as affording an
easy and cheap means of dealing with land. All Crown Grants are
issued under its provisions.
KIMBERLEY DISTRICT.
This new district comprises that portion of the Colony lying
to the North of 19° 30'' South Latitude. Its area is about 134,000
square miles, of which 80,140 square miles are leased from the
Crown, and the remainder (about 53,860 square miles) is open to
selection, at 10s. a thousand acres per annum.
Free selection, subject to approval, is allowed, and land in any
quantity over 200 acres can be bought at 10s. per acre.
Running streams are numerous in the Northern portions of
this district, and splendid alluvial plains exist in the valleys of the
rivers, which it is hoped may be suitable for tropical culture.
A very great deal of attention has been drawn to it from the
Eastern Colonies, and extensive areas are held on lease by outside
capitalists.
The Government have already expended <£lo,ooo in surveying
the district and examining its geology, so that definite information


will shortly be provided as to the suitability of the country for
tropical cultivation.
Horses, cattle, and sheep thrive well, and it is believed, by all
those best qualified to judge, that it will be a large wool-producing
country.
RAILWAYS.
There are 54 miles of Government Railway at present working,
viz., from Fremantle to Guildford, 20 miles, and from Geraldton to
Northampton, 34 miles—there are, however, 70 miles in course of
construction, viz,, between Guildford and York.
The Timber Companies have more than 60 miles of railways
and tramways for bringing timber from the ranges to the sea.
The revenue received for 1883, from 54 miles of Government
Railways then working, was <£14,515.
POSTAL.
Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion
of the Colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast.
There were at the end of 1883 sixty post offices in the Colony; over
a million of letters and a million of newspapers were forwarded or
received. The postage within the Colony is one uniform rate
of 2d. for the half-ounce (letters posted in towns for delivery therein,
Id.), and newspapers are free within a week of the issue, after
which Id. is charged. The postage to the Eastern Colonies is 2d.
per - ounce and ~d. for newspapers, and to the United Kingdom
6d. per \ ounce and Id. for newspapers. The revenue from the
Post and Telegraph Office for 1883 was: Postages £7,760, Telegraph
Messages £3,690, Fares by Mail Coach £3,199, or a total of
£14,649; and the expenditure £24,106.
TELEGRAPHS.
Electric Telegraphs are erected throughout the settled portions
of the Colony. At the end of 1883 there were 1584 miles of wire,
and 750 more miles are now being erected between Northampton
and Roebourne; the cost of sending ten words between any two
places within the Colony (excepting Perth and Fremantle, which is
6d.) is Is. The number of telegrams forwarded during 1883 was
88,018, and the revenue received £3,690. There is telegraph com-
munication with South Australia and the world.


IMMIGRATION.
A sum of £20,000 has been voted by the Legislature to en-
courage immigration. Free passages are provided from London to
the Colony by the Crown Agents to nominated persons, provided
certain formalities are complied with. There is a Board of Im-
migration appointed for the purpose of carrying out the wishes of
the Legislature, to which all communications should be addressed.
The Office of the Board is in St. George’s Terrace, Perth.
The expenditure on immigration during 1883 was <£5,500.
EDUCATION.
Government Schools exist all over the Colony and are
governed by District Boards working under a Central Board.
Compulsory clauses exist in the Act and are enforced.
Assisted Schools by different denominations are also subsidised
by the State. The amount expended on Education for 1888 was
£9,770. A High School is also subsidised by the State. There is
a High School for Girls under the direction of the Anglican Bishop,
and another conducted by the Sisters of Mercy.
SHIPPING.
During 1883, the number of ships outwards and inwards
together numbered 431, and carried a tonnage of 389,102 tons. Of
this number 184 were steam vessels.
Steamers run monthly from Melbourne via Adelaide, Albany,
and the out-ports to Fremantle. P. &O. Steamers arrive at Albany
fortnightly from England via Colombo and from Sydney via Mel-
bourne and Adelaide, making almost a weekly mail service from
the Eastern Colonies.
There is a fortnightly steam service between Albany and
Champion Bay (Geraldton), touching at Busselton (the Yasse),
Bunbury, and Fremantle; also a monthly steam service between
’Fremantle and Cossack, and one every three months between
Fremantle and Derby (King Sound) ; both these services touch at
Geraldton, Sharks Bay, Gascoyne (Carnarvon), and Ashburton.
In addition to these, there is a steam service every two months
from Fremantle to Singapore via Geraldton, Sharks Bay, Carnar-
von, Ashburton, Cossack, and Derby; and a direct steam service
every three months from London to Fremantle.


BANKS.
There are four banking institutions, viz., the Western Austra-
lian Bank, the National Bank of Australasia, the Union Bank of
Australia, and the Bank of New South Wales. Branches or
Agencies of these banks are established in several of the country
towns.
YOLUNTEEES.
In most of the principal towns Volunteer Companies are found,
and the total number of officers and men in the Colony is 636 ; the
total expenditure, during 1883, on account of the force, was £2,677.
TOWNS.
The principal towns in the Colony, and the number of their
inhabitants are—Perth, about 6000; Fremantle, about 4500;
Albany, about 1000; Geraldton, about 1000; York, about 800;
Bunbury, about 600; Guildford, about 600. About one-third of
the entire population of the Colony is therefore located in Perth
and Fremantle. There are smaller townships scattered through-
out the Colony, viz., Northampton, Busselton, Bridgetown, Pin-
jarra, Beverley, Northam, Newcastle, Gingin, Chidlow’s Well,
Carnarvon, Cossack, Roebourne, Derby, Kojonup, Moorumbine,
Rockingham, &c., &c., at all of which small centres of population
exist.
Perth, the capital of the Colony, is beautifully situated on the
right bank of the Swan River estuary, 12 miles from Fremantle,
where the river debouches into the sea. A railway connects Perth
with Fremantle.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
The Supreme Court is presided over by the Chief Justice and
one Puisne Judge. In the country districts there are Quarter
Sessions, presided over by a Magistrate; and, when occasion re-
quires, the Judges go on circuit. There are also Local Courts of
civil jurisdiction in most of the districts monthly, and Police
Magistrate’s courts daily.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.
The city of Perth and the town of Fremantle have corpor-
ations, presided over by a mayor ; and in most of the towns there


is a municipal council, presided over by a chairman. The manage-
ment of the areas within their jurisdiction is entirely entrusted to
these bodies, who are elected by the ratepayers. The roads of the
Colony are likewise managed by roads boards, elected by the
people; and the votes of the Legislature for roads and bridges
are entrusted to them.
ABORIGINES.
The native population is not large, and in the more settled
districts they are fast disappearing. They are very useful to the
pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station
hands, and settlement is very much assisted by their aid.
As a general rule they are not hostile, though very trouble-
some when they take to sheep-stealing.
Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not
been found possible to do much for them, except in teaching them
to be useful. Attempts to make them lead civilised lives have
nearly always been attended with failure. They are splendid bush-
men, trackers, &c., and are excellent companions for a journey
through their country.
CLIMATE.
The climate of the South-Western portion is said to be one of
the finest in the world, and throughout the Colony is exceptionally
healthy. In a country ranging from 13° to 35° of south latitude,
there is a great range of climate, but even in the farthest North,
there is an absence of the malarial fevers common to the tropics;
the heat is dry, though very oppressive in the Kimberley District,
but the nights are tolerably cool; and as far as the present experi-
ence extends there is no portion of the Colony that is considered
unhealthy. The South-Western corner is, however, the most salu-
brious, being seldom too hot or too cold, and having regular and
temperate seasons. Throughout Western Australia, the traveller
camps out at night, generally without any covering but a rug, and
never seems to receive any injurious effects. Annexed is a tabular
statement of the general range of the barometer, thermometer, and
rainfall, at various places in the Colony (for which see map).
CONCLUSION.
Western Australia offers special advantages to men with small
as well as to those with large capital, and taking into consideration


the varied industries in which capital can be remuneratively em-
ployed, it is very probable that, as the opportunities for investing
in station properties, in freehold and leasehold land from the
Crown or from private individuals, becomes less easy in the more
crowded Eastern colonies, more attention will be paid to the vast
Western colony, containing a million square miles and peopled by
only 31,700 persons.
