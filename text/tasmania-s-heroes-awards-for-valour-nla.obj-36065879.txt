TASMANIA'S HEROES
AWARDS FOR VALOUR

OUR HEROES
T TISTORY will do honour to the memory of the brave men who, from Tasmania,
*■ *■ as from all parts of the Empire, obeyed the call, and went out to fight for
the freedom of the world. But while it is a good thing that future generations will
recognise their worth, it is even a better thing that their own generation should do so.
The object of this booklet is to give to every man, woman, and child in Tasmania an
opportunity of knowing the names and the deeds of the nine men from this State
who have won the Victoria Cross, and of having a record of those many others whose
deeds, at the time of publication, have won for them some distinction. No attempt is
made to embroider the simple eloquence of the Official Gazette accounts of the heroic
exploits of the nine men, which gained for them that little piece of bronze, whose
intrinsic value is something less than a penny, and which thousands of pounds cannot
buy. Valour, resourcefulness, and single-minded devotion to duty make the purchase
price of the Victoria Cross, and the official records in each case show these qualities
in an eminent degree. Perhaps this record will serve to remind the people—and
particularly the children —that we have of our own folk, men who in the qualities of
true manhood have not been excelled by the heroes of romance.
The net proceeds of sales will be given to the O.A.S. Fund, which, as everyone
should know, provides for the men in the trenches those simple comforts which, to them,
are luxuries.


Lieut.-Colonel H. W. Murray
V.C., D.S.O. and Bar, D.C.M.
Lieut.-Colonel Henry William Murray
was awarded the Victoria Cross for most
conspicuous bravery when in command of
the right flank company in attack at Stormy
Trench, north-east of Guedecourt, France,
February;4 and 3, 1917. He then held the
rank of Captain in the 13th Battalion. The
deeds of bravery which gained him the
V.C. are officially described as follows:
“ He led his company to the assault with
great skill and courage, and the position
was quickly captured. Fighting of a very
severe nature followed, and three heavy
counter-attacks were beaten back, these
successes being due to Captain Murray’s
4


wonderful work. Throughout the' night
his company suffered heavy casualties
through concentrated enemy shell fire, and
on one occasion gave ground for a short
way. This gallant officer rallied his com-
mand and saved the situation by sheer
valour. He made his presence felt
throughout the line, encouraging his men,
heading bombing parties, leading bayonet
charges, and carrying wounded to places
of safety. His magnificent example in-
spired his men throughout.”
Lieut.-Colonel Murray is a son of Mrs.
C. Murray, Erina Street, Launceston. He
is a native of this State and lived formerly
at Launceston. On the outbreak of war
he was living in West Australia, and en-
listed there on September 30, 1914, as a
private. He soon received promotion, to
the rank of Sergeant, and in August, 1913,
was made a 2nd Lieutenant and was trans-
ferred from the 16th to the 13th Battalion. He
was further promoted to the rank of Lieu-
tenant in January, 1916, to Captain two
months later, and to Major in 1917. In
addition to the Victoria Cross he has
been awarded the Distinguished Conduct
Medal(forhis work atGallipoli), the Distin-
guished Service Order (at Mouquet Farm),
and a bar to the D.S.O. (at Bullecourt),
while in November, 1917, he was mentioned
in despatches by Sir Douglas Haig. In
March, 1918, he was transferred from the
13th Battalion to the Command of the 4th
Machine Gun Company and promoted to
the temporary rank of Lieut.-Colonel, and
he has been mentioned recently in de-
spatches by the Commander-in-Chief.


Captain J. E. Newland,
v.c.
Captain James Ernest Newland was
awarded the Victoria Cross for most con-
spicuous bravery and devotion to duty, in
the face of heavy odds, on three separate
occasions in March, 1917. The details are
officially described as follows “On
the first occasion he organised the attack
by his company on a most important
objective, and led personally, under heavy
fire, a bombing attack. He then rallied
his company, which had suffered heavy
casualties, and he was one of the first
to reach the objective. On the fol-
lowing night his company, holding the
captured position, was heavily counter-
attacked. By personal exertion, utter dis-
regard of fire, and judicious use of reserves,
he succeeded in dispersing the enemy and
regaining the position. On a subsequent
occasion, when the company on his left was
6


overpowered and his own company attacked
from the rear, he drove off a combined
attack which had developed from these
directions. These attacks were renewed
three or four times, and it was Captain
Newland’s tenacity and disregard for his
own safety that encouraged the men to hold
out. The stand made by this officer was
of the greatest importance, and produced
far-reaching results.”
Captain Newland was born at Camper-
down, Victoria, and is the second son of
Mr. W. Newland, of the Victorian Rail-
ways. He served as a trooper in the South
African Campaign, enlisting at the age of
18. On his discharge he joined the Aus-
tralian Garrison Artillery, and attained
non-commissioned rank. After completing
his term he entered the State Service,
but subsequently joined the military in-
structional staff, and at the time of his
enlistment he was a Staff Sergeant-Major
at Launceston. He left Tasmania on
October 20, 1914, with the first contingent
as quartermaster-sergeant, and took part
in the landing at Gallipoli. He received
his commission at Gallipoli on May 5,
1915. While there he was instructor to the
machine-gun section, and subsequently was
appointed transport officer at Alexandria.
With the main body of Anzacs he left for
France, and took part in the capture of
Pozieres, where he was wounded for the
second time. He was soon back at the
front, however, and was promoted to the
rank of captain. He was wounded a third
time, in the nose and cheek, and was sub-
sequently invalided home. In addition to
being awarded the Victoria Cross, he was
mentioned in despatches by Sir Douglas
Haig. Captain Newland now occupies the
position of brigade-major at Launceston.


The Late Captain P. H. Cherry
v.c., M.C.
Captain Percy Herbert Cherry, M.C.,
was awarded the Victoria Cross for most
conspicuous bravery, determination, and
leadership when in command of a company
that was detailed to storm and clear a
village on March 26, 1917. After all the
officers of his company had become casual-
ties he carried on with determination in the
face of fierce opposition, and cleared the
village of the enemy. He sent frequent
reports of progress made, and when held
up for some time by the enemy at one
strong point, he organised a machine-gun
and bombing attack, and captured the
position. His leadership, coolness, and
8


bravery set a wonderful example to his
men. Having cleared the village, he took
charge of the situation, and beat off most
resolute and heavy counter-attacks by the
enemy. Wounded about 6.30 in the morn-
ing, he refused to leave his post, and re-
mained there encouraging his men to hold
out at all costs, until, at about 4.30 in the
afternoon, this very gallant officer was killed
by an enemy shell.
Captain Cherry enlisted in March, 1915,
at the age of 19 years 9 months, and passed
for a commission when 20 years of age, but
owing to youth could not receive it. He
landed on Gallipoli the same year as
quartermaster-sergeant, and was promoted
to second Lieutenant. He was severely
wounded in action on Gallipoli and re-
moved to Egypt. Afterwards he pro-
ceeded to France, and took part in battles
of the Somme, including the storming of
Pozieres, in which action he was again
severely wounded. He was mentioned in
despatches, and was awarded the Military
Cross. On recovering he was employed
at a training camp for a time, and then
applied to rejoin his battalion, which he
did with the rank of Captain, and was
subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross,
as detailed above. When killed he was
still in his 22nd year. Prior to his enlist-
ment he was an agriculturist at Cradoc,
where his parents still reside.


Sergt. John Woods Whittle
V.C., D.C.M.
Sergt. John Woods Whittle was awarded
the Victoria Cross for conspicuous bravery
and devotion to duty on two occasions.
When in command of a platoon, the enemy,
under cover of an intense artillery barrage,
attacked the small trench he was holding.
Owing to weight of numbers the enemy
succeeded in entering the trench, and it
was owing to Sergeant Whittle personally
collecting all available men and charg-
ing the enemy that the position was re-
gained. On a second occasion, when the
enemy broke through the left of our line,
Sergt. Whittle’s own splendid example was
10


the means of keeping the men well in hand.
His platoon were suffering heavy casual-
ties, and the enemy endeavoured to bring
up a machine gun to enfilade the position.
Grasping the situation, he rushed alone
across the fire-swept ground and attacked
the hostile gun crew with bombs before the
gun could be got into action. He succeeded
in killing the whole crew and in bringing
back the machine gun to our position.
Sergt. Whittle at the time of his enlist-
ment was a member of the permanent
military forces, and prior to that had been
in the Navy. He enlisted on August 6,
1915, and left Tasmania in the following
month, being then 32 years of age. He
was first attached to the 26th Battalion, but
was subsequently transferred to the 12th.
Besides receiving the Victoria Cross he has
been awarded the Distinguished Conduct
Medal, and he has been wounded three
times. He is a Member of the Tasmanian
Amateur Athletic Association, has repre-
sented Tasmania in Inter-State boxing con-
tests, and is the undefeated heavyweight
champion of the island. He has several
brothers at the front. His wife resides in
Macquarie Street, Hobart.


2nd Lieut. John James Dwyer
v.c.
Second-Lieut. John James Dwyer, of the
Machine Gun Corps, was the fifth Tasma-
nian to receive the Victoria Cross, which
was awarded him for most conspicuous
bravery when in attack. He then held the
rank of Sergeant. His deeds are officially
described as follows:—“Sergeant Dwyer,
In charge of a Vickers machine gun,
went forward with the first wave of the
brigade. On reaching the final objective, this
non-commissioned officer rushed his gun
forward in advance of the captured position
in order to obtain a commanding spot.
Whilst advancing, he noticed an enemy
machine gun firing on the troops on our
right flank, and causing casualties. Un-
hesitatingly, he rushed his gun forward
to within 30 yards of the enemy gun. and
fired point-blank at it, putting it out of
action, and killing the gun crew. He then
12


seized the gun and, totally ignoring the
snipers from the rear of the enemy
position, carried it back across the shell-
swept ground to our front line, and estab-
lished both it and his Vickers gun on the
right flank of our brigade. Sergeant
Dwyer commanded these guns with great
coolness, and, when the enemy counter-
attacked our positions, he rendered great
assistance in repulsing them. On the
following day, when the position was
heavily shelled, this non-commissioned
officer took up successive positions. On
one occasion, his Vickers gun was
blown up by shell fire, but he con-
ducted his gun team back to Headquarters
through the enemy barrage, secured one
of the reserve guns, and rushed it back to
our position in the shortest possible time.
During the whole of the attack, his con-
tempt of danger, cheerfulness, and courage,
raised the spirits of all who were in his
sector of the line.”
Second-Lieut. Dwyer is the eldest of
three sons of Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Dwyer,
of Bruny Island, all of whom enlisted for
active service. He was born at Cygnet on
March 9, 1890, but has spent most of his
life on Bruny Island. He was at Queens-
town when war broke out, and was rapidly
developing into a first-rate axeman. Enlist-
ing from there on February 8, 1915, as a
member of the sth Reinforcements to the
15th Battalion, he left Tasmania in May-
following with the rank of Lance-Corporal.
He took part in the Gallipoli campaign
towards its close, and was present at the
time of the evacuation on December 19-20,
1915. He has since served in Egypt and
France, and received his first wound on
june 26, 1917, on the Western front, where
he became attached to the 4th Machine Gun
Co., in which he won the Victoria Cross.


The Late Sergt. Lewis McGee
v.c.
The Victoria Cross was awarded to
Sergt. Lewis McGee, of the 40th Battalion,
for most conspicuous bravery when, in the
advance to the final objective, he led his
platoon with great dash and bravery, though
strongly opposed, and under heavy shell
fire. His platoon was suffering severely,
and the advance of the Company was
stopped by machine-gun fire from a “ pill-
box” post. Single-handed, Sergt. McGee
rushed the post armed only with a revolver.
He shot some of the crew and captured the
rest, and thus enabled the advance to pro-
ceed. He reorganised the remnants of his
14


platoon, and was foremost in the remainder
of the advance ; and during consolidation
of the position he did splendid work.
The official account says :—“ This non-
commissioned officer’s coolness and bravery
were conspicuous, and contributed largely
to the success of the company’s opera-
tions.” Sergt. McGee was subsequently
killed in action.
Sergt. McGee, prior to his enlistment,
was an engine-driver, and resided at Avoca.
He enlisted in March, 1916, being then 27
years of age, and left Tasmania with the
40th Battalion on July 1, 1916. He was
killed in action on October 13, 1917. His
widow resides at Avoca.


Sergt. Stanley Robt. McDougall
v.c., M.M.
Sergt. Stanley Robert McDougall, of the
47th Battalion, was awarded the Victoria
Cross for most conspicuous bravery and
devotion to duty when the enemy attacked
our line, and his first wave succeeded in
gaining an entry. The official account of
his conductsays ;—“ Sergt. McDougall, who
was at a post in a flank company, realised
the situation, and at once charged the
enemy’s second wave single-handed with
rifle and bayonet, killing several and cap-
turing a machine gun which they had.
This he turned on them, firing from the
hip, causing many casualties and routing
16


the wave. He then turned;hislattention to
those who had entered, until his ammuni-
tion ran out, all the time firing at close
quarters, when he seized a bayonet and
charged again, killing three men and an
enemy officer who was just about to kill one
of our officers. He used a Lewis gun on the
enemy, killing many, and enabling us to
capture 33 prisoners. The prompt action
of this non-commissioned officer saved the
line, and enabled the enemy’s advance to
be stopped.” %
Sergt. McDougall enlisted on August 30,
1915, being then 25 years of age. He was
at first attached to the 15th Battalion, but
was later transferred to the 47th. He is
the son of Mr. John McDougall, sawmiller,
of Recherche, and his mother now resides
in Murray Street, Hobart. Sergt. McDougall
has also been awarded the Military Medal.
Prior to his enlistment he was a black-
smith at Recherche. He achieved some
reputation as a boxer, and on several occa-
sions competed in amateur competitions
with success.


Sergeant Walter Ernest Brown
V.C., D.C.M. and Bar
Sergeant Walter Ernest Brown was the
eighth Tasmanian to be awarded the Victoria
Cross. The company to which he was
attached captured a small defence system
of an enemy trench during the night.
Another enemy post 10 yards away per-
sistently sniped the Australians. Brown
crept out along the shallow trench, and
dashed towards the enemy post, but a
machine gun in another trench compelled
him to take cover'. He reached his ob-
jective by a second dash, and stood at the
door of a dugout with an uplifted Mills
grenade, calling upcr the occupants to
18


surrender. A German rushed out at him,
and a scuffle ensued, but Brown knocked
over his enemy with his fist. Cries of
“ Kamerad ” came from the dugout, and
an officer and I I men surrendered. Brown
brought back his prisoners amidst heavy
machine-gun fire.
Sergeant Brown was born at New Nor-
folk, and lived in Tasmania to within six
months of enlisting. He enlisted at Liver-
pool, N.S.W., on July 11, 1915, at the age
of 30 years and one month. He embarked
with the 1 Ith reinforcements of the Ist Light
Horse. Prior to enlisting Sergeant Brown
was employed as a grocer. He has had
service with the 20th Battalion, 55th Bat-
talion, First Field Butchery, and Second
Field Butchery. He received promotion to
Lance-Corporal on October 19, 1917, and
was wounded in the following month.
He was subsequently awarded the Dis-
tinguished Conduct Medal for specially
meritorious work, and was promoted to
the rank of sergeant. He has since been
wounded (second occasion). His father, •
Mr. Sydney Brown, resides in Bathurst
Street, Hobart,


Sergeant P. C. Statton
V.C., M.M.
Sergeant Percy Clyde Statton, M.M., is
the latest Tasmanian to receive the Victoria
Cross for conspicuous gallantry on the
field. The notification of his award ap-
peared in the ‘‘London Gazette” of Sep-
tember 27, 1918, and his deeds were de-
scribed in the cablegram announcing the
fact as follows " Whilst commanding a
platoon, and armed only with a revolver,
in broad daylight he rushed machine-gun
posts in succession, disposing of two of
them and killing five of the enemy. The
success of the attack which followed was
largely due to| his determined gallantry.
20


Later in the evening Sergeant Statton, when
under heavy gun-fire, brought in two badly
wounded men.”
Prior to his enlistment Sergeant Statton
was a farmer and resided in the Tyenna
District (Derwent Valley). He enlisted in
February, 1916, and left Tasmania in July
following as a lance-corporal in the 40th
Battalion, being attached to the same com-
pany as the late Sergeant McGee of Avoca
(then also a lance-corporal), who was also
subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross.
He was promoted to the rank of corporal a
few months later, and subsequently to the
rank of sergeant. He has been twice
wounded, and has been awarded the Mili-
tary Medal for bravery.
