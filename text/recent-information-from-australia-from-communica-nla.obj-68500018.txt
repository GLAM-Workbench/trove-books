IX. ?Recent Information from Australia. From communica-
tions made to the Royal Geographical Society.
In June last the following extract of a letter from Lieut,-Colonel
Dumaresq (New South Wales) was communicated to the Royal
Geographical Society by Mr. Hay, V. P.
? 1 must now put you in possession of a report which has been
made by a man named Barber, a runaway convict, who has lived
for these last five years with the aboriginal natives of the interior.
? He was recently captured by a detachment of the mounted
police, and states that he has twice traversed New Holland in a
north-westerly direction, and has reached the northern coast by
following the course of a river which rises towards the western
extremity of the chain of mountains by which Liverpool plain is
bounded, and by which it is separated from the valleys of the
Goulburn and Hunter rivers. He describes this river as running
in a broad and deep channel, for many hundred miles without
any impediment to its navigation, and as finally emptying itself
into a lake of great extent, whose junction with the ocean he
could not see across. The natives of the coast informed him that
strangers visit it for the purpose of procuring a scented wood,
which they float away in great quantities. These strangers are
held in great terror, and are said to be armed with two spears,
? a long and a short one,? the latter of which alone is thrown
(bows and arrows, we may conclude). They arrive in canoes
made of wood, and not formed of bark as the natives? canoes are, ?
are dressed in a kind of shirt reaching to the elbows, and wear
trowsers which do not descend below the knee. (Malays.)
? Barber further saw the stumps of many trees which had been
cut with an axe, as also a man who had been wounded with the
short spear alluded to, and which the natives describe as being
thrown with great force and precision. His story, on the whole,
is very circumstantial; and Major Mitchell (the surveyor-general)
colour. The fragments sliding over each other have a slightly metallic sound ; and
wherever the tools strike the lustre is glistening.
? I shall continue to note any changes, but refrain at present from surmising the
probable result. As the sinking goes on, the true nature of this immense bed of coal
will be developed effectually.
? I have, &c.
?H. Tanner, Captain.?


is about to proceed for the purpose of determining the fact of the
existence ot a dividing range between the sources of those waters
which Captain Sturt traced to the southward, and those mentioned
by Barber. Should this point be established, there is, perhaps,
no reason why this latter?s story may not, in all essential par-
ticulars, be correct. He is a very intelligent man, and remarkably
handsome. His body is tatooed all over; and he has completely
adopted the habits of the native blacks, over whom he has obtained
that degree of ascendency which may be supposed to result from
his superior qualities.?
On w'hich statement, and others similar received about the
same time, Mr. Cunningham (author of the paper on ?Australian
Discovery, pp. 99- ] 32) has tendered the following remarks to the
Royal Geographical Society :
? That the convict in question, on first taking to the bush and
passing to the westward of Liverpool Plains, should have found a
river running to the north-west is not at all a matter of surprise,
since he could not well avoid intersecting either the channel of the
Yorke or Field of Mr. Oxley, which are streams that drain those
extensive levels, and, after a course of more than a hundred miles
through a country to the north-west, unite and form a
tributary to the Darling of Captain Sturt. But that he subse-
quently, at any period of his long absence in the wiids of the
interior, should have traced a river across the continent to its
discharge on the northern coast, with no other means of sustenance
to support a journey of thirteen hundred miles to the nearest sea
than what an Australian forest would afford him, ?or that he should
have even had the disposition to have prosecuted so long a tour,
in which he could have induced no aboriginal native to ac-
company him to assist in procuring food as he advanced, -
seems to me extremely questionable, notwithstanding his having
adopted the habits of the savage, the tract of country over which
each family of aborigines ranges being extremely limited, and
one tribe being very careful not to pass the confine of the fishing
or hunting grounds of another.
? When first transported, this man, Barber, as I learn,
assigned to a millwright and miller, named Singleton, residing on
Hunter?s river, from whom he soon absconded, and, determining
on a wandering life in the interior, he crossed Liverpool Plains to
the westward, and soon reached the base of Arbuthnot?s range of
Mr, Oxley, named Warren-bungle by the aborigines. Some
miles to the westward of that very elevated range of mountains,
passes the Gastlereagh river of the same able traveller, the prin-
cipal streams of which originate in the western extremes of the
dividing range, by which Liverpool Plains are bounded on the
south ; and, on the banks of this river, he joined a tribe of natives,


with whom he followed it down to the north-west, upwards, as he
estimated, of four hundred miles. This distance, however, was
greatly overrated, for Captain Sturt has shown us, that in a hun-
dred miles or thereabouts, this river falls into the Darling, to the point
of confluence with which, Barber appears not to have traced its
channel; but crossing it, for some reason which does not appear,
he quitted its banks altogether, to prosecute a fresh course to the
north-east. On their new line of route, he and the natives
continued some days, when they reached the left bank of a large
river, named by the latter Kin-dur or Kiendar, which he describes
as being deep, free from falls, rapids, or other impediments to
navigation. A slight current was perceived in it, setting to the
westward, and its banks were generally so low as to be nearly
level with the surface of the water. The right, or north bank
(continues the story) was backed by lagoons, supported by freshes
from the river; but beyond, as the ground rose, extensive plains
extended, which were found to be altogether destitute of water.
In a word, by a reference to the map, it is very evident that the
Kiendar is my Gwydir, a considerable river formed by a junction
of the Peel of Mr. Oxley, with another of equal magnitude dis-
covered by me in 1827. The characters of the two agree per-
fectly, for at the point at which my party forded it, viz. at its last
rapid, it was beginning to assume those features, in its deep
channel, sluggish motion of current, and low muddy banks, which
it most probably afterwards uniformly retains, or, at all events,
presented at the point of intersection by Barber and his native
associates. And the situation of the last rapid in the bed of the
Gwydir above-mentioned, by which I passed its channel in my
journey homeward in 1827, being lat. 29� 38' S., long. 150�
20' E., and the direction the river there took interiorly, being
about W.N.W., it may be thus fairly presumed that a north-
eastern course across the country from the Castlereagh would
cut the Kiendar or Gwydir, about the meridian of 149� and
parallel of 291�, thus making the spot where the bushranger first
beheld that fine river about a hundred miles to the westward and
northward of my ford, where the navigation ceases, and where the
mean elevation of the country above the level of the sea (as de-
termined by barometrical admeasurement) was only 893 feet.
? Assuming, then, the story of this runaway, as far as regards
his journey down the Castlereagh, and his subsequent intersection
of a large and navigable river, some days? travel to the north-east
of it, to be correct, which I think is extremely probable, we have,
as above shown, the points in the interior, before unknown to
white men, to which he did thus penetrate, as well as the particular
river which he met with, and (unacquainted as he must have been
with what had already been explored by others) supposed to be a


sl discovery.? Here, however, we must rest, and say nothing of
his further progress on its banks, but rather leave that, as well as
the extreme distance to which he may have explored it to the
westward, to be determined by a more scientific traveller.
1 As it appears, however, that Barber made two distinct
journeys through the interior of the country, this may be viewed
as his first excursion ; for his history, as I have obtained it, goes
on to say, that after he had been living with the natives between
two and three years, he returned to the service of his master, Sin-
gleton, who, it would appear, received and gave him employ-
ment ; and to whom he was ever relating his adventures, and the
discovery he had made, by the aid of the natives, of a large river,
with luxuriant pasturage on its banks. At length he thus induced
him and another settler in the neighbourhood, to equip themselves
for a journey to the river, with the view of exploring it further than
he had himself done. Acting as their guide, he conducted them
to the Kiendar, which they traced for some distance through a
level country ; but one morning, when they rose to pursue their
explorations farther to the westward, the convict was missing,
having very quietly gone off at dawn of day with some natives, who
had been with the party. And thus the two adventurers were left
to find their way home as well as they could; nor was Barber
again heard of until apprehended by a detachment of the mounted
police last year.
? The second part of this extraordinary man?s history, fraught
no doubt with curious adventures, is less known in detail. It
appears, that having determined to see more of the Kiendar,
or Gwydir, as well as the interior through which it bends its
course, than he had in his first journey, he possessed himself of a
horse from one of the outer stock-stations (probably on the Cas-
tlereagh), and with this proceeded down the river; but how far he
penetrated, and what was the character of the country which
he visited, can only be determined on Major Mitchell?s return.
Thus much, however, may, I think, be anticipated with some
confidence, viz. that those parts of his story which relate to his
having followed the river for many hundred miles, to its discharge
by a lake into the ocean on the northern coast ?his having there
learned from the aborigines, (who are well known to be extremely
hostile to all strangers, in consequence of their frequent skirmish-
ings with the Malays,) that men armed with bows and arrows visit
these shores in large canoes, for the purposes of procuring a scented
wood and a marine slug?and his description of an animal like
a hippopotamus inhabiting the river, and of large baboons fre-
quenting the woods of those inter-tropical regions,?are W'holly
fabricated, and designed to excite public interest in the colony,
and avert that punishment which he doubtless apprehended


awaited him on his being captured; not simply for the act of ab-
sconding from his employer, and having been a convict at large for
several years, but for the crime of horse-stealing.
? A burning mountain also, which figures in some accounts as
an appendage to the mouth of his river, which otherwise is stated
to pursue its course very sluggishly through an internal country,
without a single hill, appears evidently to have been intended
to give additional weight and interest to the whole discovery; and
may be considered to have suggested itself to the inventive imagi-
nation of the runaway (who is admitted, on all hands, to be a very
clever, intelligent person) by the public attention being, about the
time of his apprehension by the police, directed, through the
medium of the Sydney Gazette, to the second visit of one of the
assistant chaplains of the colony to Wingen, an eminence situated
on the crest of a rocky ridge near the sources of Hunter?s river,
which was accidentally discovered, in 1818, to be on fire, and
where the process of combustion is said to be still going on.*
* [The following account of these two visits, made in 1830 and 1831 by the Rev.
C. P. N. Wilton, chaplain at Newcastle, is abridged from the Australian Almanac
for 1832
? Mount Wingen is situated on the South-Eastern side of the dividing
range which separates the lands of Hunter?s River from Liverpool Plains,
in lat. 31� 54' S., long. 150� 56' E.; and the elevation of the portion of it
under the process of combustion cannot be less than from 1400 to 1500 feet from
the level of the sea. At the period of my first visit, in the beginning of last
year, this comprehended parts of two declivities of one and the same mountain,
composed of compact sand-stone rock. The progress of the fire had previously been
down the northern and highest elevation, and it was then ascending with great fury
the opposite and southern eminence. From the circumstance of its being thus in a
hollow between two ridges of the same mountain, a former visitor was probably in-
duced to give the clefts in the mountain the appellation of a crater; but the fact is,
the rock, as the subterraneous fire increases, is rent into several concave chasms of
various widths, of which I had an opportunity of particularly examining the widest.
The rock, a solid mass of sand-stone, was torn asunder about two feet in width, leav-
ing its upper and southerly side exposed to view, the part so torn asunder having
slipt down, as it were, and sunk into a hollow, thus forming the concave surface of
the heated rock. On looking down this chasm to the depth of about fifteen feet, the
sides of the rock were perceived to be of a white heat, like that of a lime-kiln,
while sulphureous and steamy vapours arose from the aperture, amidst sounds
which issued from a depth below, like blasts from the forge of Vulcan himself. I
stood on that portion of the rock which had been cleft from the part above, and on
hurling stones down into the chasm, the noise they made in the fall seemed to die
away in a vast abyss beneath my feet. The area of the mountain, over which the
fire was raging, was about an acre and a half in extent. There were throughout
it several chasms varying in width, from which are constantly emitted sulphureous
columns of smoke, accompanied by brilliant flame, the margins of these being beau-
tified with efflorescent crystals of sulphur, varying in colour from the deepest red
orange, occasioned by ferruginous mixture, to the palest straw colour, where alum pre-
dominated. A black, tarry, and lustrous substance ?a sort of of bitumen ?abounded
on the edges of several of the clefts. Specimens of this were with difficulty
obtained, from the intense heat under foot, and the suffocating quality of the
vapours emitted from the chasms. No lava or trachyte of any description was to
be met with, nor was there any appearance of coal, although abounding in the
vicinity. The mountain has evidently been on fire for a great length of time:
several acres above the part now under combustion, on which trees are standing of


* I would further remark, however, that it appears by various
letters from the colony, that an idea is at length entertained there
a great age, having, as it were, been steamed, and many of the stones upon it
bearing the appearance of vitrification. The fire is still raging, and will probably
continue to do so with increasing fury. Materials from beneath from time to
time become ignited, whether by electricity, or other unknown cause, and the
expansive powers of the heat and steam shiver and split into huge masses the
solid rock of sand-stone, and thus form continued chasms. The sulphureous and
aluminous products of the mountain have been successfully applied in the cure of
the scab in sheep.?
About four miles along the shore, from Newcastle towards Red-head, the cliff
was also observed, in 1828, to be on fire, evolving sulphureous vapours; and a
beautifully crystallized mineral, which appeared on examination to be muriate of
ammonia, intermingled with sulphur, was collected from the margin of the crevices.
This fire, however, in 1830, became extinct; ?unlike that on Mount Wingen, of
which Mr. Wilton thus again speaks at this period :
1 The fire, since the period of my former visit, had, I found, been by no means
inactive, having extended over a surface exceeding two acres, and was now raging
with increased fury up the eminence to the S. and S.S.W., and also on the hitherto
extinct portion of the mountain, ?the northern elevation. There were still most
splendid crystals of sulphur on the margins of the more extended crevices, where
the fire was burning with a white heat, and of ammonia on those of the less, from
both of which suffocating fumes were incessantly evolving. The fire continued roar-
ing beneath, and stones thrown down into the chasms resounded to a great depth
in an interior abyss. The scene of disruption, the rocks of solid sand-stone cleft
asunder, the innumerable fractures made on the surface, the falling in of the strata,
the half-consumed prostrate trunks of trees, and others only awaiting the slip of the
rock beneath them to fall in their turn, the pernicious vapours rising around
amidst the roaring of the internal fires, and the white and red heat of the burning
crevices, present an appearance on which the beholder cannot fail to gaze with
wonder, and, at the same time, to lament his inability to account with any degree
of certainty for the first natural cause of the spectacle before him.
? At a little distance from the burning portions of Wingen, I picked up several
amorphous specimens of carnelian, white, pinkish, and blue ; angular fragments of
ribbon and fortification agates, and balls of agate, some of them filled with crys-
tals, varying from the size of a pea to that of a hen?s egg, and others of a bluish
white and clouded colour, having spots of white dispersed throughout them, which,
if cut and polished, would present a very beautiful variety of this mineral. Mount
Agate, also, in the neighbourhood of Wingen, presented me with some fine speci-
mens as well of agate (fortification and ribbon occurring in the same specimen) as
of fragments of white and bluish carnelian; and had not the grass upon the moun-
tain been so long and thick as it proved to be, I should doubtless have collected
much finer.
* Several of the agates collected from Mount Wingen, upon examination, were
found to have their surfaces crusted over with iron; some of those from Mount
Agate, with native copper; while others, from the same locality, presented a most
beautiful auriferous appearance. On Mount Wingen we found, within but a fewyards
of that portion of it which is now under combustion, the cast of a bivalvular fossil shell
in sand-stone, a species of terebratula ; other similar specimens have been met with
on another part of the mountain. Only two specimens of organic remains, of the
nature of petrified bone, have hitherto been discovered in the neighbourhood of
Mount Agate ; viz. the sacrum of some large animal on the Holdsworthy Downs,
and the second cervical vertebra of another, about ten miles west from Merton ; but
in neither instance was the petrifaction imbedded in the subjacent strata, but
merely lying on the surface of the soil; and therefore, most probably, contemporary
with the petrified wood, which is found scattered very abundantly over this tract
of country. Near the chain of the Kingdon Ponds, forming one of the sources
of the Hunter, and rising in the dividing range a few miles N. by W. from
Mount Wingen, are stumps of trees standing upright in the ground, apparently
petrified on the spot where they formerly grew. In some places the wood is


of the existence of a dividing range of hills between the sources of
those waters which Captain Sturt traced to the southward, and
those mentioned by Barber, ?or, in other words, between the
Murray which Captain Sturt followed to its estuary at Encounter
bay on the south coast, and Barber?s Kiendar, which latter joins
the Darling. To which opinion of the tendency of the internal
rivers in that country, I have subscribed ever since Mr. Oxley?s
return from his second expedition to the interior in 1818; when
he was as fully satisfied as I was, of the existence of some low
ridge of hills, or grounds of sufficient elevation, separating the
Lachlan river, and the other streams to the south of it, (which we
now know are disembogued on the south coast,) from the Mac-
quarie, and all rivers whose channels lie to the northward of it, and
which flow interiorly toward the north-west, their estuaries remain-
ing yet to be discovered. This dividing ridge of hills will, doubt-
less, be found whenever the space between Darling river in 30j ,
and the Murray in 34� south, in extent about four hundred miles,
is attentively explored.
Recent arrivals from New South Wales have also brought in-
formation of the return of Major Mitchell, after an absence of
about four months ; and colonial newspapers have been received,
which contain the two following letters (written by him from
different stations in the interior) to the local government. From
these it would appear, however, that no material discovery has
been made, the expedition having been prevented from pushing
forward beyond the country already known by a loss sustained of
a portion of its provisions, and by the more distressing circumstance
strongly impregnated with iron. About three miles along the coast south of
Newcastle, in an upright position, at high water-max-k, under the cliff, and
beneath a bed of coal, was also lately found the butt of a petrified tree, which, on
being broken, presented a fine black appearance, as passing into the state of jet;
and on the top of the cliff at Newcastle on which the telegraph stands, imbedded at
about a foot beneath the surface, lying in a horizontal position and nearly at right an-
gles to the strata of the cliff, the trunk of another, finely grained and white, ?both
specimens being traversed by thin veins of calcedony. The coal, which is exposed
to view on the face of the cliffs, is of the independent formation, and appears to run
generally in three parallel horizontal beds; bxxt in some places with a varying
dip. It alternates in one part of the cliff with slaty clay, sand-stone, and shale,
with impressions of leaves; at another with mill-stone grit, and a hard chertzy rock.
Nodules of clay-iron stone, and trunks and stems of arundinaceous plants in iron-
stone, are seen in abundance in the alternating strata of the cliff; and in one place
a narrow bed of iron-stone, bearing impressions of leaves, is remarkable; while
thin laminae of the same mineral, the surface of which is traversed by square and
variously-shaped sections, are seen on several parts of the shore, both in the face of
the cliff parallel with the beds of coal, and extending into the sea, forming the
strand at low water.? ]


of the death of two of the party, who were brutally murdered by
the natives :
? Bullabalakit, on the River Nammoy,
in lat. 30� 38' 21" S. long. 149� 30' 20" E. Dec. 23,1831.
? Sir, ?I have the honour to state, for the information of his
Excellency the Governor, the progress I have made in exploring
the course of the interior waters to the northward of the colony.
? On crossing Liverpool Range my object was to proceed north-
ward, so as to avoid the plains and head the streams which water
them, and also the mountain ranges on the east.
* 1 arrived, accordingly, by a tolerably straight and level line, at
Walamoul, on Peel?s River; this place (a cattle station of Mr.
Brown) being nearly due north from the common pass across
Liverpool Range, and about a mile and a half above the spot
where Mr. Oxley crossed this river.
? I found the general course of the Peel below Walamoul to be
nearly west; and after tracing this river downwards twenty-two
miles, in direct distance, I crossed it at an excellent ford, named
Wallamburra. I then traversed the extensive plain of Mulluba ;
and leaving that of Coonil on the right, extending far to the north-
east, we passed through a favourable interval of what 1 considered
Hardwick?s Range, the general direction of this range being two
points west of north.
? On passing through this gorge, which, from the name of
a hill on the south side, may be named Ydire, I crossed a
very extensive tract of flat country, on which the wood consisted
of iron bark and acacia pendula; this tract being part of a
valley evidently declining to the north-west, which is bounded
on the south by the Liverpool Range, and on the south-west
by the extremities from the same. On the west, at a distance of
twenty-two miles from Hardwicke?s Range, there stands a re-
markable isolated hill named Bounalla ; and towards the lowest
part of the country, in the direction in which all the waters tend,
there is a rocky pic named Tangulda. On the north, a low
range, named Wowa, branching westerly from Hardwicke?s Range,
bounds on that side this extensive basin, which includes Liverpool
Plains. Peel?s River is the principal stream, and receives, in its
course, all the waters of these plains below the junction of Con-
nadilly, which I take to be York?s River, of Oxley.
? The stream is well known to the natives by the name Nammoy ;
and six miles below Tangulda, the low extremities from the
surrounding ranges close on the river, and separate this extensive
vale from the unexplored country which extends beyond to a
horizon which is unbroken between W.N.W. and N.N.W.
( The impracticable appearance of the mountains to the north-
ward induced me to proceed thus far to the west, and on examin-
ing the country thirty miles north-east by north from Tangulda, I


ascended a lofty range extending westward from the coast chain,
and on which the perpendicular sides of masses of trachyte (a
volcanic rock) were opposed to my further progress with horses ;
it was therefore evident that the river, supposed to rise about the
latitude of 28� would not be accessible, or at least available to the
colony in that direction, and that, in the event of the discovery of
a river beyond that range flowing to the northern or north-western
shores, it would become of importance to ascertain whether it was
joined by the Nammoy, the head of this river being so accessible
that I have brought my heavily laden drays to where it is navigable
for boats, my present encampment being on its banks, six miles
below Tangulda. From this station I can perceive the western
termination of the Trachytic range, and 1 am now about to explore
the country between it and the Nammoy, and the further course
of this country, and in the event of its continuance in a favourable
direction, I shall fix my depot on its right bank, whence I now
write, and descend the stream in the portable boats.
? I have the honour, &c.
* T. L. Mitchell, Surveyor-General.?
? The Honourable the Colonial Secretary, &c. &c.?
? Peel?s River, 29th February, 1832.
1 Sir, ?I have the honour to inform you, for the information of
his Excellency the Governor, that I have reached the left bank of
this river with my whole party on my return from the northern
interior, having explored the course of the river referred to in my
letter of 23d December last, and others within the 29th parallel of
latitude.
? There was so much fallen timber in the Nammoy, and its
waters were so low, that the portable boats could not be used on
that river with advantage, and I proceeded by land in a north-west
direction, until convinced by its course turning more to the west-
ward that this river joined the river Darling. I then quitted its
banks with the intention of exploring the country further north-
ward, by moving round the western extremities of the mountains
mentioned in my former letter, and which I have since dis-
tinguished in my map by the name of the Lindesay Range.
These mountains terminate abruptly on the west, and I entered a
fine open country at their base, whence plains, or rather open
ground of gentle undulation, extended westward as far as could
be seen. On turning these mountains I directed my course north-
ward, and to the eastward of north, into the country beyond them,
in search of the river Kindur, and reached a river flowing west-
ward, the bed of which was deep, broad, and permanent, but in
which there was not then much water.


* The marks of inundation on trees, and on the adjoining high
ground, proved that its Hoods rose to an extraordinary height; and
from the latitude, and also from the general direction of its course,
I considered this to be the river which Mr. Cunningham named
the Gwydir, on crossing it sixty miles higher, in his route to More-
ton Bay. I descended this river, and explored the country on its
left bank for about eighty miles to the westward, when I found
that its general course was somewhat to the southward of west.
This river received no addition from the mountains over that part
of its left bank traversed by me; and the heat being intense, the
stream was at length so reduced, that I could step across it. The
banks had become low, and the bed much contracted, being no
longer gravelly but muddy. I therefore crossed this river, and
travelled northward, on a meridian line, until, in the latitude of
29� 2', I came upon the largest river I had yet seen. The banks
were earthy and broken, the soil being loose, and the water of a
white muddy colour. Trees, washed out by the roots from the
soft soil, filled the bed of the river in many places. There was
abundance of cod fish, of a small size, as well as of two other
kinds of fish which we had caught in the Peel, the Nammoy, and
the Gwydir. The name of the river, as well as w 7 e could make it
out from the natives, was Karaula.?Having made fast one tree to
the lop of another tall tree, I obtained a view of the horizon,
which appeared perfectly level, and I w?as in hopes that we had at
length found a river which w'ould flow' to the northward and avoid
the Darling. I accordingly ordered the boat to be put together,
and sent Mr. White with a party some miles down to clear away
any trees in the way. Mr. White came upon a rocky fall, and
found besides the channel so much obstructed by trees, and the
course so tortuous, that I determined to ascertain before embark-
ing upon it, whether the general course W'as in the desired direc-
tion. Leaving Mr. White with half the party, I accordingly
traced the Karaula downwards, and found that its course changed
to south, a few miles below where I had made it, and that it was
joined by the Gwydir only eight miles below where 1 had crossed
that river. Immediately below the junction at the Gw'ydir (which
is in latitude 29� 30' '2.7", longitude 148� 13' 20") the course of the
river continues southward of w'est, directly towards where Captain
Sturt discovered the river Darling; and 1 could no longer doubt
that this was the same river. I therefore returned to the party,
determined to explore the country farther northward.
1 The results of my progress thus far w'ere sufficient, I con-
sidered, to prove that the division of the waters falling towards the
northern and southern shores of Australia is not, as has been sup-
posed, in the direction of the Liverpool and Warrabungle range,
but extends between Cape Byron on the eastern shore, towards


Dirk Hartog?s Island on the west; the greater elongation of this
country being between these points, and intermediate between the
lines of its northern and southern coasts. The basin of the streams
1 have been upon must be bounded on the north by this dividing
ground or watershed ; and although no rise was perceptible in the
northern horizon, the river was traversed by several rocky dykes
over which it fell southward, their direction being oblique to the
course, and nearly parallel to this division of the waters. I beg
leave to state, that 1 should not feel certain on this point without
having seen more, were it not also evident from Mr. Cunning-
ham?s observations, made on crossing this division on his way
to Moreton Bay. Mr, Cunningham, on crossing the head of this
river, nearly in the same latitude, but much nearer its sources,
found the height of its bed above the sea to be 840 feet: at about
forty-five miles further northward the ground rose to upwards of
1700 feet, but immediately beyond, it reached a river flowing
north-west, the height of which was only 1400 feet above the sea.
He had thus crossed this dividing higher ground, between the
parallels of 29� and 23�. It appears, therefore, that all the
interior rivers we know of to the northward of the Murrim-
bidgee, belong to the basin of the Karaula?this stream flowing
southward ; and hence the disappearance of the Macquarie and
other lower rivers may be understood, for all along the banks
of the Karaula, the Gw'ydir, and the Nammoy, the country,
though not swampy, bears marks of frequent inundation : thus
the floods occasioned by these rivers united, cover the low country,
and receive the Macquarie, so that no channel marks its further
course.
? That a basin may be found to the northward receiving the
waters of the northern part of the coast-range, in a similar manner,
is extremely probable, and that they form a better river, because
the angle is more acute between the high ground, which must
bound it on the north-east and the watershed on the south.
1 therefore prepared to cross the Karaula, in hopes of seeing
the head, at least, of such a river, and to explore the country two
degrees farther northward, but moving in a north-west direction.
My tent was struck, and I had just launched my portable boat for
the purpose of crossing the river, when Mr. Surveyor Finch, whom
1 had instructed to bring up a supply of flour, arrived with the dis-
tressing intelligence, that two of his men had been killed by the
natives, who had taken the flour, and were in possession of every
thing he had brought?all the cattle, including his horse, being also
dispersed or lost. I therefore determined not to extend my excur-
sion farther, as the party were already on reduced rations; and on
the Bth instant I retired from the Karaula, returning by the marked
line, which being cut through thick scrubs in various places, is now


open, forming a tolerably direct line of communication in a north-
west direction from Sydney, to a river, beyond which the survey
may be extended whenever his Excellency the Governor thinks fit.
? The natives had never troubled my party on our advance ; in-
deed, I only saw them when I came upon them by surprise, and
then they always ran off. M heir first visit was received at my
camp on the Karaula, during my absence down that river, when
they were very friendly, but much disposed to steal. Various
tiibes followed us on coming back, but never with any show
of hostility, although moving in tribes of a hundred or more
paiallel to our marked line, or in our rear, it was necessary to be
ever on our guard, and to encamp in strong positions only, arrang-
ing the drays for defence during the night: three men were always
under arms, and I have much pleasure in staling, that throughout
the whole excursion, and under circumstances of hardship and
privation, the conduct of the men was very good. I took an armed
party to the scene of pillage, anti buried the bodies of the two men,
who appeared to have been treacherously murdered while asleep by
the blacks during the absence of Mr. Finch: no natives were to
be found when 1 visited the spot, although it appeared, from
columns of smoke on hills which overlooked it, that they were
watching our movements.
Ihe paity has now arrived within a day?s Journey of Brown?s
station, and I have instructed Assistant-Surveyor White (from
whom I have received great assistance during the whole journey)
to conduct it homewards, being desirous of proceeding, without
delay, to Sydney, to receive the instructions of his Excellency the
Governor. < I have the honour to be, &c.

evtls fiom falling into its channel. Its course is moreover to the north


above the spot where that able traveller forded it on the Ist
of September, 1818, whilst on his route easterly with his party
towards Port Macquarie. The situation, therefore, of VValamoul
(the out-station of a Mr. Brown) in the wooded country on the
north-eastern side of Liverpool Plains, is in latitude 31� 7' SO" S.,
and longitude 150� 12' 30" E.
1 Finding it impracticable to pursue a course to the north from
that station, in consequence of the high lands connected with
Hardwicke?s Range, Major Mitchell determined to make an
offing to the westward in the first instance, and, accordingly, he
proceeded to trace Field?s river (the Nammoy of the natives)
downwards on its left bank, the general course of which proved to
be in that direction.
? In their route the party traversed extensive patches of plain,
having native names, which were ascertained, and which appear to
be the heads of the great valleys of Camden and Barrow of the late
Surveyor-General; the former, the north-western branch of Liver-
pool Plains, through which the Yorke of Mr. Oxley, or the Con-
nadelly of the natives, winds towards its junction with the Field.
At length, having followed this river to a level open country
beyond the hills, the expedition rested on its right bank at a spot
locally named Bullabalakit, whence the Surveyor-General addressed
his first letter to the local government, reporting the progress of his
expedition, and his intention to employ the portable boats with
which he had been provided, in descending the stream, from the
place where his tents were pitched, and which he ascertained, by
observation, to be in latitude 30� 38' south, and longitude 149� SO'
east, or about six miles to the north of those Morasses which pre-
vented the late Mr. Oxley (who little apprehended that he was in
the vicinity of a river) from advancing to the north-east in August,
1818.
* The Field, which had, in that year of great rains, overflowed its
banks and inundated the adjacent grounds, was, however, now
found to be so low, with its channel so much obstructed by drift
timber, that Major Mitchell could not advantageously employ his
boats ; and as he immediately afterwards discovered that the direc-
tion of its course was continued to the westward, and that it must
ultimately fall either into the Castlereagh or Darling (probably the
former) he gave up its further examination, and at once directed
the march of his expedition towards the north. On this course the
(at least as far as the parallel of 30�) and not westerly, as Major Mitchell found
that of the river on which himself and party were, which receives, as he observes,
the waters of the plains. This is therefore the Field of the late Surveyor-General,
on the left bank of which, about fifteen miles below Walamoul, I rested my party
in July 1827; the spot on which my tents then stood being about forty-four English
miles to theE.S.E.of Major Mitchell?s encampment on the same stream in December
last.


party traversed an extent of level open country, in search of the
river Kindur, reported to have been seen by the runaway convict;
and, after a journey of several days, they reached its left bank,
where its channel, though broad and deep, contained, neverthe-
less, but little water, such having been the effects of solar evapora-
tion ; the heat of the atmosphere being also, at the time, intense.
And the intersection, by the expedition, of this river, in about
29� 13' south, and longitude 149� 23' east, satisfied Major Mitchell
that it was indeed identical with my Gwydir, which I had forded in
1827, about sixty miles higher, or to the south-east, whilst on my
return from Moreton Bay.
? The Gwydir, or Kindur, then, was now followed on its left
bank, upwards of eighty miles to the westward, in which space
not a single tributary fell into it; and as its channel at that distance
became (as Captain Sturt had found the Morrumbidgee near
its junction with the Murray) much contracted, and its banks very
low, Major Mitchell left it also, as he had done the Nammoy, and
directing the steps of his party northerly (under the meridian
of about 148� 20' east), he gained, in about thirty miles, the bank
of a third river, called by the aborigines, as far as they could
be understood by our travellers, Karaula, which being of greater
magnitude than either of the other streams explored, and flowing
through a perfectly level country, led the party to entertain the
hope that they had really at length found a river, which would
pursue a steady course in the ? desired directionviz. towards the
north-west. Its banks, moreover, which were inhabited by natives
of a friendly disposition, were earthy and broken, and its waters,
although turbid, were discovered to contain three species of fish.
( A subsequent examination, however, ascertained that the navi-
gation of its channel was also interrupted by fallen timber, and
other obstructions; and the expectation of its long course to the
north-west was soon given up, when it was seen to take a decided
bend to the south, and, in a few miles, unite itself to the Gwydir,
or Kindur, at a point of its course to the west, shown, by the ob-
servations taken, to be only sixty-three statute miles E.N.E. from
the junction of the Castlereagh and Darling, as ascertained by
Captain Sturt, thereby proving that the confluence of the Karaula *
and Kindur form the latter river.
* ? I would here notice that the Karaula is the same river that I passed in the
parallel of 29�, whilst on my outward-bound route to Moreton Bay in 1827, and
then named ? Dumaresq,? the gravelly bed of which, exceeding eighty yards in
breadth, and at that period in part dried up by an eighteen months? drought, I
found by the barometer to be only 840 feet above the level of the sea. It rises,
however, at an elevation of about 3000 feet, in the great dividing range which,
between the parallels of 27� and 29�, extends under the meridian of 152�; and as
Major Mitchell fell in with its channel in a level interior (certainly not 800 feet
above the sea-coast) in latitude 29� 2', and about 140 miles distant from the spot at
which my party had crossed it, its course between our two points of intersection of
its channel is shown to be almost directly west.


? Having thus seen the junction of these streams, it was the
design of Major Mitchell to have continued his journey northerly
from the Karaula or Dumaresq, with the view of verifying a theory,
which it appears he entertains, of the existence of a chain of high
grounds in 28� south, which, as he supposes, stretches from the
dividing range, westerly, towards Dirk Hartog s Island, off
Shark?s Bay, on the shores of Western Australia, and thus sepa-
rates the several waters, now known to form the Darling, from
streams, which having a more northern origin in the great coast-
range, pursue a course, through the inter-tropical portions of the
interior, westerly and northerly.* However, the distressing cir-
cumstances, to which he refers in his despatch to the local govern-
ment, prevented his crossing the parallel of 29�, and making the
discoveries he had promised himself; for on the bth of Febiuaiy
we find him quit the banks of the Dumaresq, or Karaula, and
retracing his steps, in three weeks again make the Field, or Nam-
moy, within a day?s journey of the cattle station at Walamoul.
< r Ph e hypothesis of a ? dividing-ground or water-shed,? extend-
ing in the parallel of 28�, westerly, from the great Coast-chain,
appears, however, somewhat gratuitous; for Major Mitchell him-
self admits, that from the extreme point to which he was enabled
to penetrate into the interior, viz. his encampment on the Karaula
in 29� 2', no rise was perceptible on the northern horizon. And the
following brief remarks on the features of the country traversed by
my party in 1827, between latitudes 28� and 29�, (and which are
given at greater length in my preceding paper in this volume,) w ill
further show how far it derives support, as Major Mitchell con-
ceives that it evidently does, from the results of the barometrical
observations which I then made.
? Throughout that journey I found the interior suffering greatly
from the effects of a long and generally prevalent drought. I
nevertheless w'as enabled to pursue nearly a direct course to the
north, between the meridians of 130� and 151�, through a country
of moderate undulations, the mean elevation of which (above the
level of the sea) proved to be about 1100 feet. On reaching the
parallel of 29�, however, we found that we had descended nearly
300 feet, to a barren level tract of country extending far and wide
around us, through which w 7 e discovered the Karaula, or Du-
maresq, passing to the westward ; and excepting on its immediate
banks, where we met with a scanty vegetation, the w?hole might be
f* Major Mitchell bases this theory on the circumstance of the curvature of the
eastern coast-line in the parallels of 27� and 28�, from which he infers, that tle
great dividing chain, which sweeps in a curve parallel to it, and therefore is
? concave towards the interior, must form a very extensive basin, which should con-
centrate its waters about the latitude of 28� south.? He explains this at length m
a letter addressed to Mr. Hay,?also communicated by him to the Royal Geo-
graphical Society,?and cites the origin and course of the Amazon as constituting
a similar case elsewhere.]


said to be a perfect waste, entirely destitute of grass or esculent
herbage. To relieve, therefore, the half-famished horses of my
expedition, I was necessitated to pursue a more eastern course
than I would, under other circumstances, have done ; which led us
among the hills, where we fortunately did meet, not only with
some little pasturage, but a sufficiency of water to meet our daily
wants. And in this new line of route to the eastward, which
employed us a week of severe exercise before we gained the great
downs in the parallel of �B�, we gradually rose in elevation from
811 to 1100, 1344, and even 1717 feet above the sea-shore, ere
we reached the left bank of Condamine?s Rivulet, to which we,
however, again descended upwards of 300 feet, its elevation above
the shore of Moreton Bay being 1402 feet.
1 But these hills, notwithstanding their progressive rise to a
height of 900 feet above the bed of the Karaula, constitute, never-
theless, no dividing ridge (giving opposite directions to the course
of the waters, that flow interiorly from the main range), but are
merely a succession of lateral ridges, which extend westerly from
the main or leading coast-chain of mountains, and, doubtless,
either terminate abruptly in bluff points or heads, overlooking the
lower interior, or gradually decline in elevation as they advance
westerly, until they disappear on the general level. And that this
is the real structure of the interior in and about the parallel of 28�,
I am fully induced to believe, from what I beheld of the country
to the northward of my station in the latitude of 29�, before
I had directed my course among the hills to the eastward, in order
to avoid, what was obviously between the points of north by east
and north-west, a level arid waste.
? Another expedition, despatched to explore the country northerly,
beyond the banks of the Karaula, or Dumaresq, in 29�, where
Major Mitchell?s excursion terminated, will most probably dis-
cover to the westward of the meridian of 150�, an interior, extend-
ing through several degrees of latitude, of level unbroken surface ;
and it will, moreover, be found, that Condamine?s Rivulet (the
stream to which the indefatigable commander of the late expedi-
tion refers in his second despatch, as being 1400 feet above the
level of the sea), so far from being separated from the Karaula, by
a ? dividing-ground ? extending westerly, ultimately falls into it,
and thus forms a small auxiliary to the Barling of Captain Sturt,
of which, most probably, indeed, it is not even the most northern
branch.
1 Although the result of the late expedition has not been the
discovery of any new river, still its conductor has intersected and
traced those already known, farther to the westward than had been
previously seen, and has thus shown their tendency towards the
channel of the Barling. The story of the convict runaway, he has


also proved to be, for the most part, a mere fabrication ; but the
question, of what becomes of the Darling, beyond the spot where
Captain Sturt left it, pointing to the south-west, remains still
unanswered. A. C.?
Despatches have been also received, within the last few days,
from Lieut.-Governor Stirling, Western Australia ; the following
extract from which, with the accompanying map, has been further
communicated to the Royal Geographical Society, by direction of
Viscount Goderich, President.
? Swan River, 2 d April, 1832. ?The only portion of Western
Australia which has been any way examined or explored is
inclosed in the accompanying map ot reference, which will afford,
at a view, a general idea of the routes and discoveries ot the
principal exploring parties. It will not be requisite for me to
enter into the details of the reports which have been made to me
on these matters ; but I shall endeavour to give a general sketch of
the information which we possess relative to the soils, the surface,
the supply of water, the climate, and the indigenous products ot
the country.
? The coast from Gantheaume Bay on the west to Doubtful
Island Bay on the south, including the several islets and rocks,
present the remarkable calcareous substance which has been sup-
posed to exist in no other place than on the shores of New
Holland and on those of Sicily. Although it serves in general as
a kind of edging to this part of the continent, it is occasionally
interrupted by the protrusion of granite and trap ; and it is in
some places covered by sand. The open downs which it forms
sometimes afford good sheep-keep, and it burns into very tine
lime ; but in general the soil upon it is of little value. Behind
this sea range of hills, which are sometimes 800 feet in height,
and two or three mdes in breadth, there is a low sandy district
which appears to have had a diluvial origin, as it exhibits oc-
casionally pebbles and detached pieces of the older rocks, and
varies from mere sand to red loam and clay. In some parts this
sandy district presents considerable portions of very tine sod, and
in no part is it absolutely sterile. The banks of the rivers, which
flow through it, are of the richest description of soil, and although
a large portion would not pay for cultivation at the present price
of labour, it is not unfit for grazing. Out of this sandy plain
there occasionally arise ranges and detached hills of primitive
formation, the most extensive of which is the range which bounds
the plain on the east or landward side, and extends from the
south coast between Cape D?Entracasteux and Wilson s Inlet,


northward to the 30th degree of latitude. The highest altitude
attained by these primitive mountains is about 3,500 feet, which
is supposed to be the height of Roi Kyncriff, behind King George?s
Sound ; but the average height may be stated at 1000 feet. To
the eastward of the principal of these ranges is an interior country
of a different formation from that on the coast, being of a red loamy
character. It appears to have the lowest portion of its surface
about 500 feet above the level of the sea, and discharges all its
waters westwardly, or southwardly, through the range aforesaid.
Some of these streams have a constant current, and would afford
a supply of water in the dryest months; and, in general, neither
the interior nor the country near the coast can be said to be badly
watered.
? Such is the imperfect sketch which I am able to afford of the
general surface of the country. In the quality of its soils it is
extremely variable ; but there have been ascertained to exist, by
Captain Bannister, Mr. Dale, and many other explorers, extensive
districts of land of the best kind. And having given that point
every attention, being fully aware of the great importance of being
well assured that there is a sufficiency of fertile land, I may now
express my conviction, from the reports of others no less than by
my own observations, that there is abundance, and indeed as large
a proportion of it as usually exists in such extensive territories.
? The only products of the country of any value at present are
its timber, which is inexhaustible and of excellent quality, and its
grasses, which afford feed of superior quality for sheep, horses, and
cattle. There is a good species of tobacco and perennial flax,
similar to the kind usually cultivated in Europe; but these are as
yet only valuable as indicative of the capabilities of the soil.
1 For some time back registers of the weather have been kept at
King George?s Sound and at Perth ; and hereafter it will be pos-
sible to ascertain with precision the ranges of the temperature, the
barometrical pressure, and the degree of moisture in these districts,
compared with other countries. At present, after three years?
experience of the climate of the Swan River district, it may
be said to be exceptionable only in the months of January,
February, and March, when the heat and drought are as dis-
agreeable as they can be without affecting health. The district of
King George?s Sound being exposed to southerly winds in summer,
and frequently visited by showers, is the most equable, perhaps, in
the world, and the most temperate. The heat on the west coast
is certainly intense, and the mosquitos, which abound there in
summer, are serious evils in their way, and have caused some dis-
like to this part of the country as a place of residence. But not-
withstanding these and other local and trivial objections, the
climate, the ports, the position, and extent of the country, are


such as fit it to be the seat of a wealthy and populous possession
of the crown; and I feel justified in saying, in this stage of its
occupation, that it will not fail to become such, from any natural
disqualification of the soil.?
X.? Expedition to ascertain the Fate of Captain Ross. From
Materials communicated to the Royal Geographical Society.
Two expeditions have been planned, during the present season,
in this country, in which the pursuit of geographical science
is combined, to great advantage, with other more stirring incen-
tives to action; and for which, accordingly, the requisite funds will
be furnished, in whole or in part, by private zeal. One is a
trading expedition up the Quorra, consisting of two steam-vessels
and a brig, well armed, and most liberally equipped, which sailed
last July, under the command of Mr. M'Gregor Laird, one of the
enterprising Liverpool merchants who have engaged in this magni-
ficent commercial speculation ; having also on board Mr. Richard
Lander, as interpreter and guide, and Lieutenant Allen, R.N., as
surveyor, appointed to this service by the Admiralty, and furnished
with every requisite instrument for making an exact survey of the
river, so far as his opportunities may permit. The other is a land
expedition destined to penetrate across the territories of the Hudson?s
Bay Company to the shores of the Arctic Sea, primarily to ascer-
tain the fate of Captain Ross, who, it is well known, has not been
heard of since he sailed in a steam-boat three years ago, with the
view of thus effecting a north-west passage to the Pacific ; and,
subordinate to this object, to extend our knowledge of those
shores ?in particular, to endeavour to fill up the interval between
Cape Turnagain (the eastern limit of Sir John Franklin?s disco-
veries) and the Straits of the Fury and Hecla, where Sir Edward
Parry was stopped by the ice when attempting to penetrate to the
westward along the coast; or, should these prove, as some ima-
gine, merely the entrance of an inlet, to determine where else
is situated the north-eastern extremity of the American continent.
The hopes entertained by Captain Ross?s friends that he and
his companions are still alive, and may be extricated from their
critical position by efforts yet made for their relief, are founded,
partly on the extent of his preparations, which were calculated to
meet his wants for three years, ?partly on the amount of stores
which, it is presumed, he would find untouched in the wreck of
the Fury, abandoned by Sir Edward Parry in 1825, ?and partly on
the following account (given by Hearne, and quoted by Mr. Bar-
row in his Chronological History of Arctic Voyages, pp. 276-8.)
