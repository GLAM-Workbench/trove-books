A FOREWORD.
THIS book is published to commemorate the work of an artist who was
of the people, and who gave to the people the splendid harvest of his
talent.
The name of Claude Marquet is known throughout Australia. His
cartoons, appearing for many years in “The Worker,” had a wide publicity,
and every week tens of thousands of men and women in all the States derived
from their vivid imagery and keen satire instruction on all the vital questions
of the time.
His fertility was amazing. With an intellectual swiftness that often
had something uncanny in it he would visualise in pictorial terms the true
inwardness of a situation, the hidden significance of a crisis, and realise his
vision in black and white while ordinary folk were still wondering what it
all might mean.
A gift so rare and illuminating is too historically valuable to be buried
in the dusty files of a newspaper, and so generally was this felt that, when the
first shock of our comrade’s untimely and tragic death was over, it was
suggested from all sides that some of his best drawings should be brought
together in book form, and offered to his numerous admirers as a permanent
memorial of one who so powerfully influenced their thought, and the thought
of the whole people.
The task of making a selection was a difficult one, so embarrassing was
the wealth of material, but it is hoped that the contents of this volume will do
justice to the striking merits of the artist and at the same time serve as
a picture-record of some of the most momentous events of our day.
The printing and publishing of the book have been done by “The
Worker” Trustees without charge, all costs being borne by them, while
Messrs. E. C. Chapman and Co. have generously made a free contribution of
the binding, and the Smith and Julius Studio of the design for the cover.
The entire proceeds of the sale of the book will thus be available for the
benefit of the widow, whose whole-hearted devotion to her husband and his
work was the brightest feature of his life.

IN MEMORY OF CLAUDE MARQUET
Who was drowned on the I 7th of April while sailing
home across Botany Bay.
HIS friends will look across the bay
With eyes grown sad and dim—
The bay that drowned the fighting face
And the big kind heart of him —
To where a woman weeps to-night.
In a cottage by the sea.
And mourns the grave they’ll never dig
In the sands of Waverley.
Oh, the sympathy in simple things,
Like good Australian wine,
And the ready coin for down-and-out
And thirsty souls like mine!
The bay is grey and the bay is gone,
And the sea is dark and near.
Where the great cliff-breakers rise like wraiths
To one who cannot hear.
The moon is up and the moon is high,
And the sea is broad and bright,
Where a strong soul in a silvered boat
Goes sailing East to-night.
He sails to meet the morning star,
And meet the morning light
Where none need draw for politics
And none of us need write.

JOHN STOREY, Premier of New South Wales.
THE Labor Movement and picture journalism have lost a good man
and true in the death of Claude Marquet. Fate has cruelly cut short a
most promising career.
Young in his profession, enthusiastic, versatile, and clever, Claude
would have done big things. But much of his work will live as an inspiration
to the awakening masses, who are gradually pushing aside the;old order to
make room for the new.
1 am glad to know that a collection of his best work is being published
in book form, and I hope that every unionist will buy a copy for his parlor
glance at the pictoriaL lessons of the times it
book shelf, and occasionally
contains.
heartfelt sympathy goes out. She is bearing
all good things will go to make her prosperous
To Claude’s widow my
her cross bravely, and I hope
and happy.

FRANK TUDOR, M.P., Federal Labor Leader.
THE late Claude Marquet will ever be remembered by the people of
Australia. As one of the workers of the great Labor Movement he
nobly strove to teach the people that with their own efforts a brighter
outlook was before them.
Whilst all regret that so valuable a life was suddenly taken from us,
yet we derive no small measure of satisfaction from the knowledge that, in his
50 years, Claude Marquet was privileged to do a great , deal to help the
Movement which means so much, to us all.
His cartoons since he joined the staff of “The Worker” in 1906 have
materially assisted in the improvement of the conditions of the people and
to the advancement of the Cause. The work done by him during the existence
of the Deakin-Cook Fusion had very far-reaching effects, as was plainly seen
in the result of the election in April, 1910, when Labor swept the polls.
During the conscription campaigns he gave very valuable assistance to
the anti-conscriptionists, and perhaps the work done by him during those
critical periods may be ranked as his best.
It is, I think, too soon yet to correctly gauge the true value of his work,
but’one must admit that his cartoons played an important part in the making
and destroying of Governments.
Such splendid types of men can ill be'spared during the troublesome
times which are ahead of us, and his loss is deeply mourned throughout the
length and breadth of this country.
I take this opportunity of tendering my sincerest sympathy to
Mrs. Marquet in her sad bereavement, and do hope that she will be comforted
in her hour of trial by the knowledge that his life has not been a wasted one.


CLAUDE MARQUET.
THE sea he loved has taken him.
Nor storm nor call can waken him.
The stairs that knew him wait in vain
To hear his footstep come again,
Like faces mute the great doors stand
That once flew open to his hand,
But wider doors shall memory keep,
Remembering him where’er he sleep.
Strong hand, strong heart, keen eye that burned
To bring a light where darkness turned;
Deep love of human kind that, yet,
Hallows the way before us set —
Here was no empty one who sold
The gift he held for tainted gold!—
Little he cared, our sun-brown Claude,
Whether the world gave blame or laud!
He loved the sail, he loved the Bay,
But other sails he set to play—
A thousand sails he loosed to find
The wider ocean of the mind;
The pennon that his pencil flew
Flamed on each line of all he drew!
And now the sea has taken him;
There is no call can waken him.
Put down the board against the wall,
Lay down the pen and cover all,
Turn out the lamp: there comes no more
His eager step across the floor. . . .
. . . He was the friend of wind and wave—
The wind he loved has found his grave:
The sea he loved has taken him—
Nor wind nor wave shall waken him.

ARTHUR BLAKELEY. M.H.R., President, A.W.U.
THE benediction of a grateful Labor Movement goes out to our late
comrade, Claude Marquet.
When he went, there departed one of the big men of Australia. His
was the vision of an Australian, big in mind, big in heart, and as open
as the Western Plains.
We of the A.W.U. profoundly regret his sudden and tragic end. It has
left a void that cannot be filled. In the prime of his life, and at the zenith
of a brilliant career, he went, leaving his great work incomplete.
Warm-hearted and generous to a fault, as clean as the Pacific winds which
he loved, he was beloved by those who had the privilege of knowing him.
His quiet humor and pleasant disposition endeared him to all who came in
contact with him.
He lived through, and depicted with an inimitable pen, the vast changes
which have taken place in the industrial and political world during the past
twenty years.
His biting satires, his pen laying bare, scalpel-like, the humbug and the
hypocrite, were the work of a master.
‘ I like to think of him best as I saw him at Kurnell last year, standing in
his boat “Doreen,” browned with the sun and wind, waving farewell as he
slowly drew out into the Bay.
Nothing can assuage the poignant grief of his sorrowing wife and comrade,
left a lonely figure on the sands of Kurnell. She has lost a partner in life,
we have lost a comrade, the world has lost a master. Vale, Claude Marquet I

E. GRAYNDLER, General Secretary, A.W.U.
BY the untimely death of Claude Marquet, Australia lost its best
cartoonist. The Labor Press and Labor Cause lost a man it could not
spare. He gave his best, every day and always.
I have known him to “chase an idea or inspiration” all day, and into
the night. He would not rest until he had got the best for the time and
occasion.
"Something else” would not do.
This was characteristic of his whole being. In his unselfish spirit and
unbounding hospitality it was the same. He never permitted a friend in need
to pass his way without a helping hand being extended.
That he did not possess as much of this world’s goods as his talent and
ability could have commanded is not a matter of wonder to his friends. He
was content with the simpler forms of life, and happy in his home and the good
opinion of those who had the pleasure of his acquaintance,
I was privileged to share the hospitality of his home for an all too brief
night and day some few weeks before his death.
The unostentatious hospitality and homeliness of the welcome of his good
wife and himself, and the memory of that pleasant evening, and Claude’s
quiet, dry humor, will ever remain with me.
The work he has left behind him will long endure, and the innumerable
friends throughout Australia who mourn his loss are an eloquent testimony to
his great worth.
He needs no better monument.

FRANK W. LUNDIE, Secretary, Adelaide Branch, A.W.U., and
President, “Worker” Board of Control.
CLAUDE MARQUET, Artist, Laborite and Mate. When asked to
write a few lines of appreciation of the noble work of one of the most
self-sacrificing natures with whom I have been in touch, my mind
travels over a long friendship of 25 years. My feelings towards him, and
the pangs of regret at his sudden death, make it difficult for me to speak
of other than these two things. But there are many reasons for our
admiration of Claude Marquet, and why we will always hold his memory
in respect.
1 do not feel competent to judge his artistic work, which is admired by
every Labor man and woman in the Commonwealth, but 1 do know the thrills
which many of his brilliant cartoons have given me.
When I speak of him as a Laborite and mate, I can speak freely.
Never a better Laborite broke the Bread of Life, and never a truer mate could
any man wish for in sorrow or tribulation. His kindly and generous nature
was always a source of solace, and his generosity was not merely of the tongue.
Good-bye, Claude Marquet, Artist, Laborite, and Friend; you were a
white man all through.
The world is poorer and I a sadder man because you are gone.


W. H. LAMBERT, President A.L.P., and Secretary, Central
Branch, A.W.U., New South Wales.
A SPLENDID cartoonist, Claude Marquet will be sadly missed from the
future propaganda work of the Labor Movement. His cartoons of
national interest have been reprinted in every State in the
Commonwealth, and the scope of his influence was probably greater than
that of any other Labor propagandist.
The instinct with which he sensed the most complex political
developments, and, with a couple of skilfully drawn figures, enabled the
simplest minds to correctly size up a situation at a glance, was, in my opinion,
the great outstanding feature of his work.
During the memorable Anti-Conscription campaign the name of Claude
Marquet was legion. His most notable cartoons were distributed broadcast
throughout Australia by the Australian Labor Party, and they undoubtedly
played a great part in assisting the people to arrive at a correct decision on
the momentous conscription issue.
Perhaps the effectiveness of his cartoons in the political field was never
better illustrated than on the occasion when that clever but irresponsible
politician, John Norton, stood for the Senate in 1910, and burnt up thousands
of pounds’ worth of petrol on the State-wide campaign in a magnificent
80 h.p. motor car. No man ever did more individual campaign work than
John Norton did on that tour, but he was fighting a quarter of a million copies
of Claude Marquet’s deadly cartoons, and, when the numbers went up, John
was somewhere near the bottom of the poll, with just sufficient votes to save
his deposit.
Of Claude’s sterling personal qualities I need add but little to what
has already been written. A valiant champion of the under-dog, his work
reflected the man, and there are many little circles where Claude will be best
remembered as a generous friend of the friendless.


THE PEOPLE’S ARTIST.
CLAUDE MARQUET, you were Nature’s own,
A lover of the wave and wind;
She moulded, made you of her best—
Brave, equable, forgiving, kind.
Green trees behind, blue depths before,
Bare-browed, brown-armed, you loved to be
Where morning tide and midnight tide
Came creeping from the outer sea.
And Art you loved, for I have seen.
When shadows in the mangroves lurked
The lone light in the little house
Where you, the people’s artist, worked.
To help the Right, to aid the True, -
You gave the best you had to give;
You died, but evermore through time
Somehow,' somewhere, your work sliall live.
You dwelt where Beauty cast- her spell
On moonlit bay and shining reach,
But Beauty now shall, shadowed, walk
Along the sands' of Silver Beach.
The great tides claimed you at the last— r
The gray day fading wan and wild;
You : died a strong sea-lbver’s : death.
And as you died I know ycu smiled.

FRANK ANSTEY, Victoria.
IN the year 1903 the Victorian railroad men went on strike, and the theii
Premier, “Iceberg" Irvine, countered with his break-them-up Coercion
Act. That knocked the bottom out of the strike, but it brought to the
office of the Melbourne “Tocsin” a quiet, unassuming man with a cartoon
on the situation.
The “Tocsin" was loaded with debts and libels, but it bought the cartoon,
and another and another, and the last was always better than the one before.
The cartoons appeared over the sighs “C.M.” or “Quet,” and finally
“Claude Marquet.”
We could not keep him fully employed, so he did work for others, but
his heart work was always for the underdog.
His was a genial, an obliging nature; the kindly word, the kindly deed.
When he went to link up with “The Worker” he left behind him in Melbourne
a host of friends and a memory of glorious fellowship and hours of genial joy
that will endure as long as life lasts and love lives to kiss the lips of death.

IN MEMORY OF CLAUDE MARQUET.
WHEN dragons, whose huge bulk made heaven shrill
In their quick flight to wreak malicious harm,
Wilted with ardent breath the opposing arm
And bade the summoning trumpet-blare be still,
Merlin, as fugitives with broken will
Came staggering for his aid in pale alarm.
Traced curious lines and hummed a subtle charm,
And smote the monsters by his magic skill.
We too have had our Merlin. In the fight
Against foul Greed and his appalling powers,
While others failed, in him we put our trust.
He pierced the shield of many a recreant knight;
His delicate tracing shook primeval towers
And laid pot-bellied dragons in the dust.


J. F. HIGGINS, Editor, “The Labor News.”
BY the death of Claude Marquet, who was drowned at Botany Bay on
Saturday, 1 7th April, the Labor Movement suffers its greatest individual
loss since the passing of Donald Macdonell.
It was, I remember, at the suggestion of Donald Macdonell that
Claude Marquet, already distinguished by his cartoons in the “Bulletin,”
“Punch,” and “The Labor Call,” was offered and accepted a position on
“The Worker” in 1906. Since that time Claude’s work has become political
history, and his cartoons have invaded every nook and corner of the
Commonwealth. They have been reprinted for propaganda purposes in
every State, and during the Conscription campaign more than a million copies
of the famous “Blood Vote” cartoon alone were distributed.
The influence of his cartoons on the great Conscription issue has perhaps
never been fully appreciated, except by those with an inside knowledge of
the extent to which they were republished and circulated. Claude, himself,
at no time made any claims for recognition for his share in achieving Labor’s
victories, although the scope of his influence was probably greater than that
of any other Labor propagandist.
With the innate modesty of true genius, he placed little or no value on
his own merits, and could only, in rare instances, be prevailed upon to discuss
his work. But his heart and soul were in the great Movement to which he
devoted his talent, and his love for, and faith in the ultimate accomplishment
of, Labor ideals were beyond all considerations of self.
Big-hearted and liberal to a fault, he met every demand on his
benevolence without question, and, I believe, that as an inevitable result of
his good nature, his only worldly possessions consisted of the little cottage
built by his own strong hands at Kurnell, and the small sailing boat on which
he spent his spare hours on Botany Bay.
On that little boat Claude had painted the titular indication—“ ’Er
name’s Doreen”—a happy tribute to his old chum Dennis, of “Sentimental
Bloke” fame; and many a toil-worn, weary wayfarer has sailed the bay with
Claude and found fresh inspiration from the manly, hopeful sentiments which
constituted his great charm for his fellow-men.
I can see him now. His strong, kindly face in the moonlight; his elbow
resting on the side of the boat. “What are those lines of Gordon again,
Jack?” he is saying—“you know”
“Question not, but live and labor
’Till yon goal be won:
Helping every feeble neighbor,
Seeking help from none.
‘Life is mostly froth and bubble,
Two things stand like stone —
Kindness in another’s trouble,
Courage in your own.
“Courage, comrades, this is certain
All is for the best—
There are lights behind the
Gentles, let us rest!”
And in these, his favorite verses, is reflected the spirit of this great
cartoonist, whose unselfish dedication of his exceptional talent to Labor and
humanity makes one of the finest chapters in the annals of our Movement.

J. M. MACKAY, Sub-Editor, “Hobart World.”
NEWSPAPER men, handling “copy” relating to almost every subject,
become wholly impersonal. All they feel when at work is what may
be called the romance of news.
But when, in the chill midnight of April 18, a bunch of press wires
came through, there was something in one of them which meant not romance
but tragedy grim to me. It announced a boating disaster at Botany Bay, and
that my old pal, Claude Marquet, had been drowned.
I skip across the mist and mirth of 22 years to the time when I first
met Claude Marquet. He was then cartoonist on “Quiz,” an old established
political and social weekly in Adelaide, to the editorship of which I had
succeeded. Like a joyous sunbeam Claude Marquet entered the editorial
den.
We talked of many things in what seemed to me a brief space of time.
On going Claude said, with boyish frankness: “I think you’ll do.” I “did.'
For thus began a solid palship that endured in shadow and shine in three
cities—Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney—for over a score of years, which
seem all too short now he’s gone.
In Melbourne, at the instigation of Frank Anstey, M.H.R., he did some
striking cartoons for the “Tocsin,” and for many years afterwards he supplied
an annual Eight-Hour Day cartoon for its successor, the "Labor Call.”
For quite a while he was on Melbourne “Punch" staff, and when
G. H. Dancey went to England for a long health spell Claude produced the
chief cartoon weekly.
It was some time after that-—about 14 years ago—that he became
associated with “The Worker," and he never looked back. Here was a paper
whereon his democratic spirit could find potent expression, and his virile
drawings came to be intimately associated with the progress of the public life
of Australia.
In many respects Claude Marquet was a genius. He could make
anything—bar enemies. From house-building to trick toys for children,
nothing came amiss to him. In private life few men were as humorous as he,
and in quaintly exaggerative humor that would puzzle the offensively sane
he had a charm all his own.
He loved the sea. We had boated together in several waters, and I
cannot help thinking that it must have been a terrible sea or squall which
“got” him and his companion, Harry Palmer, because Claude was an expert
craftsman in any old weather.
Claude’s soul was in the sea, and now the sea has claimed all that was
mortal of him. Memories of a brave heart and a grand pal crowd in on me
as I write these few words of tribute for his book.

A NERVE CURE.
P^ ar Worker, —1 have often read, mostly in fiction, of persons having
had their sense of hearing, speech, and even their mental balance restored by
some sudden shock to the system. Here san actual case.
For the past twelve years I have been absolutely devoid of any sense
of smell, caused by a stroke of facial paralysis. (You have no doubt noted
my paralytic features.) Last week I met with a severe scalding accident to
m y dght hand, and when I had cooled off a little I found I had recovered
my smelling powers.
The next day I spent quite a delirious day in the city smelling things.
Motor car- odors were a dejight, and fish-shops were heavenly.,
I am not a selfish man, and to anyone suffering in a similar way I offer
my method of acquiring the necessary shock. First, send your wife away bn
a holiday. Women are so apt to interfere in this treatment.
Decide to make yourself a cup of, tea and put one pint of water in the
kettle, and place over a lighted-gas-ring. Continue your occupation (which,
by-the-way, must be a political cartoon, with the Premier and a dog in it—this
is essential) and forget all about the kettle.
In, say, half-an-hour, remember the cup of tea you need so badly and
hurry out to the kitchen. Grasp the red-hot kettle firmly with the right hand
and turn on the water-tap with the left. Here you receive the desired shock,
which also brings out any dormant dancing proclivities.—Yours,
