Rule 1. Every tariff and supplement containing schedules of
charges and regulations filed with this Commission, on and after the
first day of September 1935, pursuant to the Communications Act of
1934, shall conform to the following rules, and every such tariff and
supplement filed before that date shall be revised on or before the
first day of January 1936, to conform to such rules, unless otherwise
specially authorized by this Commission.
Rule 2. The term “charges” whenever used herein shall be con-
strued to include rates. The term “regulations” whenever used herein
shall be construed to include rules, practices and classifications. The
term “Act” whenever used herein means the Communications Act of
1934. The term “Commission” whenever used herein means Federal
Communications Commission.
Rule 3. (a) In the main office of the filing carrier to which the
public shall have access, in every city, town or village in the United
States where such carrier has an office, there shall, on and after the
first day of January 1936, be posted and kept open for public inspec-
tion every rate and regulation applicable to and from such city, town
or village, and all such rates and regulations shall be the same as
those which are on file with this Commission: provided, however,
that instead of such rates and regulations being posted and kept open
for public inspection as above provided, every tariff and supplement
containing schedules of charges and regulations applicable to or from
every point in each State in which such carrier operates, and filed
with this Commission, may be posted and kept open for public in-
spection in the main office of the filing carrier to which the public
shall have access, in every city having a population of 100,000 or
more in said State, and also in the State capital; but if the filing
carrier does not operate in such city, then every such tariff and sup-
plement shall be posted and kept open for public inspection in the
largest city in said State in which it does operate and in the State
capital. When tariffs and supplements are posted as last above pro-
vided, a notice shall be displayed in every business office of the filing
carrier to which the public shall have access, in every city, town and
village in said State, including the cities wherein postings are made,
which said notice shall contain a statement naming the nearest city
wherein a posting is made and giving the street address in said city
and in the capital wherein postings are made; also a statement that


the interstate and foreign message toll telephone rate schedules in use
at each toll center are available for public inspection during regular
business hours at an office in the toll center. A statement shall also
be displayed in connection with every notice in each toll center giving
the exact business office in such toll center and exact location where
such schedules may be inspected. Every such notice shall contain a
statement that it is made in compliance with the posting rule of the
Federal Communications Commission.
(b) The term “posted” means kept in a convenient place accessible
to the public for public inspection.
Rule 4. (a) All tariffs and supplements shall be in book, pam-
phlet, or loose-leaf form of size inches, and shall be plainly
printed on hard calendered, No. 1 machine-finished book or 20-pound
bond paper of durable quality. Type of size not less than 6-point
shall be used, except as provided in rule 5 (a). Stereotype, piano-
graph, mimeograph, or other process equally durable may be used,
provided that the copies posted and filed are clear and legible in
all respects. Reproductions by hectograph or similar process shall
not be used.
(b) Erasures or alterations in writing shall not be made in tariffs
or supplements filed with the Commission or in those posted for
public convenience, and a sufficient margin without any printing
thereon shall be allowed at the binding edge of every tariff and
supplement, so that when the book or binder containing the tariff
or supplement is open, all printed matter on each page will be
clearly in view and legible, but the margin allowed shall in no event
be less than five-eighths of an inch in width.
Rule 5. The titlte page of every tariff and supplement shall show
in the order named:
(a) On upper right-hand corner, the F. C. C. number of tariff or
supplement in capital letters or in not less than 12-point bold face
type, and immediately thereunder the F. C. C. number or numbers
of tariffs or supplements canceled thereby. If the canceled issues
are so numerous as to render it impracticable thus to enter the num-
bers thereof on the title page, the numbers thereof shall be shown
immediately following the table of contents and specific reference
to that fact shall be entered on the title page directly under the
F. C. C. number.
(b) The exact'name of the carrier, including a receiver or receivers,
if any, issuing the tariff or supplement, and a brief statement show-
ing each class of service provided for therein, the geographical ap-
plication of the tariff or supplement, and whether such service is
carried on by wire or submarine cable telegraph, wire or submarine
cable telephone, radiotelegraph or radiotelephone. The term “sub-
marine cable” as used herein means deep sea cable used in trans-
oceanic communications.
(c) Date of issue and date effective, except as authorized in
rule 10.

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION


(e) The name, title and street address of the officer issuing the
tariff or supplement.
Rule 6. Tariffs shall contain in the order named:
( a ) Table of contents: A full and complete statement showing
the exact location and specifying the page or section and page num-
bers, where information by subjects under general headings in alpha-
betical order, will be found. If a tariff contains so small a volume
of matter that its title page or its interior arrangement plainly dis-
closes its contents, the table of contents may be omitted.
(5) (1) The exact name or names of carriers subject to the Act,
alphabetically arranged, concurring in the tariff.
(2) If the carriers so concurring are numerous, the names thereof
may be stated in alphabetical order in a separate schedule filed with
this Commission, provided, however, that specific reference to such
schedule by F. C. C. number is made in the tariff at the place where
such names would otherwise appear. Such schedule shall conform
to rule 4 hereof.
(3) The naming of any such carrier as concurring in any such
tariff, however, shall not be construed as relieving such carrier from
its duty to file its schedules of charges as provided in Section 203
of the Act, unless such carrier shall file an instrument duly exe-
cuted by such carrier expressly stating that it concurs in such tariff
and in such tariff as it may be amended, and that it accepts the pro-
visions thereof.
(c) The exact name or names, alphabetically arranged, of con-
necting carriers as defined in Section 3- (u) of the Act participating
in communications and in charges therefor, provided, however, that
if such connecting carriers are numerous, the names thereof may be
stated in alphabetical order in a separate schedule filed with the
Commission and specific reference made by F. C. C. number to such
schedule at the place in the tariff where such names would otherwise
appear. Such schedule shall conform to rule 4 hereof.
(<f) (1) Explanation of symbols, reference marks, and abbre-
viations of technical terms used in tariffs.
(2) The following symbols shall be used in tariffs for the pur-
poses indicated below and they shall not be used for any other
purposes:
R to signify reduction.
I to signify increase.
C to signify changed regulation.
T to signify a change in text but no change in rate or regu-
lation.
S to signify reissued matter.
N to signify new rate or regulation.
D to signify discontinued rate or regulation.
( e ) Such explanatory statements in clear and explicit terms re-
garding the rates and regulations contained in the tariff as may be
necessary to remove all doubt as to their proper application.
(/) General rules, regulations, exceptions, and conditions which
govern the tariff; the title or subject of each rule, regulation, excep-
tion, or condition to be shown in distinctive type. Under this head
all general rules, regulations, exceptions, or conditions which in any
3
TARIFF CIRCULAR NO. 1


way affect the charges named in the tariff shall be entered. A spe-
cial rule, regulation, exception, or condition affecting a particular
item or charge shall be specifically referred to in connection with
such charge.
(a) An explicit statement of the charges in cents or in dollars
and cents of United States currency, per chargeable unit of service
for all communication services, together with a list of the cities,
towns and localities to and from which message rates apply, all
arranged in a simple and systematic manner; provided, however,
that charges for foreign communications may be stated in such for-
eign currency as is required by any international convention or
treaty. Complicated or ambiguous terms shall not be used, and no
rule, regulation, exception, or condition shall be included which in
any way attempts to authorize the substitution for any rate named
in the tariff of a rate named in any other tariff.
Rule 7. ( a) If a carrier subject to the Act participates in joint
charges between points on its own line and points on the line of
another carrier, and such charges are published by such other carrier
on authority of the former carrier, the former carrier may by proper
tariff publication refer by F. C. C. number to the tariff or tariffs of
the carrier in which the charges are published.
( b) Any carrier subject to the act shall have the right, if it so
elects, to file its concurrence in the application of the existing charges
of any other carrier or carriers to its own interstate toll points, and
in addition to said concurrence to file the first reference lists of such
carrier or carriers, but specific reference by F. C. C. number shall be
made to the tariff or supplement containing such charges.
Rule 8. (a) Section 203 (b) of the Act requires that no change
shall be made in charges, classifications, regulations, or practices
which have been filed and published except after thirty (30) days’
notice to the Commission and to the public, unless otherwise author-
ized by the Commission. This provision applies to charges and regu-
lations which have once become effective, as well as to charges and
regulations which have been published but which have not yet oecome
effective.
(6) It follows that after notice of a change has been published and
filed the new charges or regulations must be allowed to become effec-
tive and remain so for at least thirty days from their effective date
before any change can be made therein, except as may be otherwise
specially authorized by the Commission. The period of notice herein
required shall begin on, and include, the date the tariff or supplement
is received bv the Commission but shall not include the effective date.
(c) Manifestly it is impracticable for the Commission to check
all the items in tariffs to determine whether or not statutory notice
has been given. Therefore, except as otherwise specially authorized
by the Commission, thirty days’ notice to the public and the Commis-
sion shall be given as to every tariff and supplement filed with the
Commission, regardless of whether or not changes are effected thereby,
except as provided in rules 8 (d), (e), (/), (g), and (i).
(a) Tariffs filed in the first instance pursuant to section 203 (a)
of the Act shall be filed upon not less than seven (7) days’ notice
to the Commission and to the public. This is applicable only to
service for which schedules of charges have not previously been filed
with the Commission.


( e ) Charges and regulations applicable at, from, to, or via points
on newly constructed lines or at, from, to, or via new points of com-
munication by radiotelegraph or radiotelephone stations shall be
established in the first instance on not less than seven (7) days’
notice.
(f) Charges and regulations for individual installations of market
and stock quotation and baseball ticker service may be established
on not less than one day’s notice to the Commission and to the public,
when there are no existing charges and regulations in effect for such
service at the points where installations are to be made.
{g) When any change is made in a charge by a foreign carrier or
foreign administration not subject to the Act and such charge is used
as a factor of through charges published and filed by a carrier sub-
ject to the Act, for communications between points in the continental
United States and points in any foreign country, a change in such
through charges may be established by the carrier subject to the Act
on not less than one day’s notice to the Commission and to the
public; provided (1) that the carrier subject to the Act has no con-
trol over such charge of such foreign carrier or foreign administra-
tion by contract or otherwise, (2) that the change in through charges
shall reflect only the difference in through charges caused by the
change in such charge of such foreign carrier or foreign adminis-
tration, (3) that a tariff or supplement shall be filed each time a
reduction is made in the charge of such foreign carrier or foreign
administration, as well as when increases are made, and (4) that
every such tariff and supplement shall show the portion of the
through charges accruing to the carrier subject to the Act.
(A) Every tariff or supplement filed under authority of rule 8 ( d ),
( e ), (/) or (g) shall bear a notation that it is issued under authority
of such rule.
(i) (as amended by Commission Order 12-B, effective July 15,
1936) Message toll telephone service points and teletypewriter ex-
change service points added or discontinued during a calendar month,
and mileages for private line services added during a calendar month,
may be filed not later than 20 days after the end of such month; pro-
vided that the basic schedules of charges and regulations applicable
to such message toll telephone, teletypwriter exchange and private line
services are already on file and in effect, and provided, further, that
the effective date of each addition or discontinuance is shown and
reference is made to this rule.
(f| Every change made in existing charges or regulations in any
tariff or supplement shall be indicated therein by use of the uniform
symbols shown in rule 6 ( d ).
(&) When a change of the same character is made in all or in sub-
stantially all schedules in a tariff or supplement, or on any page
thereof, that fact and the nature of such change may be indicated
in distinctive type at the top of the title page of the tariff or supple-
ment, or at the top of each page whereon the change is made, in the
following manner: “All charges in this tariff or supplement are in-
creases”, or, “All charges on this page are reductions, except as other-
wise provided in connection with specific rates.” Under this para-
graph the applicable symbol shall be used to indicate a charge in
which no change has been made.

TARIFF CIRCULAR NO. 1


(I) When a tariff or supplement canceling a previous issue omits
points of origin or destination, charges or regulations, or routes,
which were contained in such previous issue, the new tariff or supple-
ment shall indicate the cancelation in the manner prescribed in rule
9, and if such omissions effect changes in charges or regulations, that
fact shall be indicated by the use of the uniform symbols prescribed
in rule 6 (d).
Rule 9. (a) Any tariff may be canceled by another tariff or by a
supplement. Cancelation of a tariff automatically cancels every sup-
plement thereto, except a canceling supplement.
(b) Cancelation or tariffs or supplements shall be indicated as
provided in rule 5 (a). If a tariff or supplement or a revised page
is issued which is to cancel a part of another tariff or supplement
then in force and not thereby canceled in full, the new tariff, supple-
ment, or revised page shall specifically state what portion of such
other tariff or supplement is thereby canceled and such other tariff or
supplement shall at the same time be correspondingly amended,
effective on the same date.
(o) When a tariff is canceled in whole or in part by a supplement,
the supplement shall show where the charges and regulations will
thereafter be found or what charges and regulations will thereafter
apply.
(а) When a tariff is canceled in whole or in part by another tariff
which does not contain all the charges or regulations shown in the
tariff or part to be canceled, the canceling tariff shall show where the
charges and regulations not shown therein will thereafter be found
or what charges and regulations will thereafter apply.
( e) When portions of a tariff (excepting a tariff in loose-leaf form)
or or a supplement to a tariff, are designated as items, the items shall
be given numbers. When an item or numbered rule is canceled by
supplement, the item or rule in the canceling supplement shall be
given the same number as the canceled item or rule, but a letter
suffix shall be added to the canceling item or rule. Cancelation shall
then be made in the following manner: Item or rule 40-A cancels
item or rule 40; item or rule 40-B cancels item or rule 40-A; and so
on. In effecting cancelation of an item or rule, reference shall be
made to the previous supplement, if any, wherein the item or rule is
published.
( f ) When an item or rule is canceled, the canceled matter need not
be reproduced in connection with the item or rule effecting the can-
celation, except to the extent necessary to identify the item or rule.
( g ) The foregoing rules regarding cancellation shall apply regard-
less of whether a tariff or supplement is filed by a carrier or its agent.
Rule 10. (a) A change in, or addition to, a tariff shall be known as
an amendment, and, excepting amendments to tariffs of less than five
pages, and amendments to tariffs in loose-leaf form, shall be published
in a supplement to the tariff. When an amendment is made in a num-
bered item or rule, such item or rule shall be published in a supple-
ment in its entirety as amended.
(б) Matter contained in every supplement shall be arranged in the
same manner and order as in the tariff which it amends.
(c) Supplements to a tariff shall be numbered consecutively. Each
supplement shall specify on its title page the supplement, supple-
ments or tariff which it cancels or amends.

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION


{d) Every tariff or supplement which contains charges or regula-
tions effective upon a date different from the general effective date of
such tariff or supplement shall show on its title page the following
notation: “Effective ,19 ( except as otherwise
-provided herein )” or “( except as provided on page ).”
(«s) Every tariff or supplement which consists partly but not wholly
of matter established upon less than statutory notice, shall bear a nota-
tion in connection with each change made effective on less than stat-
utory notice, that such matter is “Issued on days’ notice under
authority of (here give specific reference
to the special permission, decision, order, rule, or other authority).”
(/) Matter which has not been in effect for 30 days and is brought
forward without change from another tariff, also matter brought
forward without change from one supplement to another, shall bear
the appropriate symbol provided in rule 6 (d) for reissued matter;
and in connection with such reissued matter the number and orig-
inal effective date of the tariff or supplement in which the matter
was originally published shall be shown, unless such matter was
originally made effective on a date other than the general effective
date shown on the title page of the tariff or supplement in which it
was originally published, in which event the original effective date
of such matter shall be shown.
Rule 11. (a) Except as hereinafter provided, tariffs of four pages
or less shall have no supplement; not more than one supplement shall
be in effect at any time to a tariff containing five and not more than
sixteen pages; not more than two supplements shall be in effect at
any time to a tariff containing seventeen and not more than eighty
pages; not more than three supplements shall be in effect at any
time to a tariff containing eighty-one and not more than two hun-
dred pages; and not more than four supplements shall be in effect
at any time to a tariff containing more than two hundred pages;
provided, however, that not more than ten supplements in addition
to those above authorized may be in effect at any one time in which
charges or regulations are published on one day’s notice under
authority of rules 8 (f) and ( g ).
( b ) Except as otherwise authorized, tariffs containing five and
not more than twelve pages shall have not more than four pages
of supplemental matter, and tariffs containing more than twelve pages
shall have supplemental matter aggregating not more than 33
per cent of the number of pages in the tariff.
( c) Pages of loose-leaf tariffs shall be printed only on one side of
the sheetj and they must be consecutively numbered and designated
as “Original page 1”, “Original page 2*’ ? etc. At the top of each
page shall be shown the name of the issuing carrier, the page num-
ber, and the F. C. C. number of the tariff. At the bottom of the page
shall be shown the date of issue, the effective date, and the name,
title, and street address of the issuing officer.
(d) Changes in, and additions to, loose-leaf tariffs shall be made
by reprinting the page upon which a change or addition is made, and
such changed page shall be designated as a revised page. For ex-
ample, “First revised page 1 cancels original page 1”, or “Second
revised page 2 cancels first revised page 2”, etc. When a revised title
page is issued, the following notation shall be shown in connection
with its effective date:
7
TARIFF CIRCULAR NO. 1


Original tariff effective (Here show
the effective date of the original tariff.)
(e) When a revised page is issued which omits charges or regula-
tions theretofore published on the page which it cancels and such
charges or regulations are published on a page other than the revised
page, the revised page shall make specific reference to the page on
which the charges or regulations will be found.
(f) If it is desired to file additional pages to a loose-leaf tariff,
such pages shall be numbered beginning with the number next suc-
ceeding the number of the last page of the tariff, and shall be desig-
nated as “Original page ” For example, when the tariff filed
has 150 pages, the first page added after page 150 shall be designated
as “Original page 151. II such pages are to be inserted between
numbered pages, each such page snail be designated as an original
page and shall bear the number of the immediately preceding page
followed by the suffix A, B, C, and so on. For example, when two
new pages are to be inserted between pages 44 and 45 of the tariff,
the first page shall be designated as original page 44A and the
second page as original page 448. No additional page can be filed
except for the purpose of adding new matter which does not change
the charges or regulations then in force on other pages of the tariff.
{a) The page of every loose-leaf tariff next to the title page shall
be designated as “Original page 1” and shall be known as a “Check
Sheet.” When the original tariff is filed, the check sheet shall show
the number of pages contained in the tariff. For example, “Pages
1 to 150, inclusive, of this tariff are effective as of the date shown.”
When new pages are added, such as pages numbered 151, 152, and
so on, the foregoing notation shall be correspondingly revised to
include the added pages. When pages are revised, when new pages
(including pages with letter suffix) are added to the tariff, or when
supplements are issued, the check sheet shall be revised accordingly.
(A) Revised check sheets listing the added or revised pages shall
accompany such pages when forwarded to the Commission for filing.
( i ) Changes shall be indicated as required by rule 6 (d). Items
which have been in effect thirty days or more need not be shown
as reissued items on revised pages but may be published as effective
on thirty days’ notice. Items which have not been in effect thirty
days when brought forward on revised pages shall be shown as re-
issued in the manner prescribed in rule 10 ( f).
(j) A supplement of five or more pages shall have an index of the
matter which it contains.
Rule 12. (a) When the name of a carrier is changed, its operat-
ing control is transferred from one carrier to another in whole or in
part, or a receiver is appointed for the carrier, the receiver or carrier
which will thereafter operate the properties shall immediately file
and post an adoption notice, numbered in its F. C. C. series, reading
as follows:
The hereby adopts, ratifies and makes

Its own or his own in every respect, all applicable tariffs and amendments
thereof filed with the Federal Communication Commission by,

rier shall file a consecutively numbered supplement to each of the
tariffs covered by the adoption notice, reading as follows:

the tariff of the pursuant to its adoption
(Exact name of the successor carrier)
notice F. C. C. No.
( c ) Supplements issued under authority of this rule shall contain
no other matter.
(d) If a carrier ceases operations without having a successor its
tariffs shall be regularly canceled on statutory notice, unless other-
wise authorized by the Commission.
( e ) When only a portion of properties is transferred, charges ap-
plying locally between points on the transferred portion shall, as
soon as practicable, be incorporated in tariffs or supplements of the
successor carrier. In all such instances the predecessor carrier shall
cancel the corresponding charges from its tariffs or supplements
effective on the same date, with reference to the F. C. C. number of
the tariff or supplement or the successor carrier for charges applying
thereafter.
Rule 13. (a) All charges used in making combination through
rates for interstate or foreign communications, including charges
used for that purpose between points in one State, shall be filed with
the Commission. Such charges may only be changed as to such
traffic in accordance with the terms of these rules and of the Act.
(&) No tariff, revised page, or supplement will be received by the
Commission unless it is delivered to it free from all charges, includ-
ing claims for postage.
(c) Tariff or supplements which have been forwarded to the
Commission for filing or which have been received by the Commis-
sion in the ordinary course of business will not be returned to car-
riers, unless rejected for cause.
(i d ) Tariffs, revised pages, or supplements which are received for
filing too late to give the Commission the notice required by law are
subject to rejection and return. In computing the notice required,
Sundays and holidays shall be counted. Except as provided in rule
8 (i), no consideration will be given to telegraphic or telephonic
notices or to the time during which a tariff publication may be held
by a transportation agency or by the Post Office Department.
( e ) As to tariffs, revised pages, and supplements issued on less
than statutory notice under permission, decision, order or regulation
of the Commission, strict compliance with all the conditions named
therein will be required; otherwise they will be rejected.
( f) When a tariff is rejected by the Commission as unlawful, the
numoer which it bears shall not be again used. Such tariff shall not
thereafter be referred to as canceled, amended, or otherwise, but the
publication that is issued in lieu of such rejected tariff shall bear
notation “In lieu of , rejected by Commission.”
( g) When an entire tariff or supplement or a portion thereof is
issued in compliance with a decision or order, and regardless of
whether it is made effective on statutory notice or on less than statu-
tory notice under special authority granted in the decision or order,

instances. Applications for permission to establish charges or regu-
lations, on less than statutory notice, or for waiver of any of the

will not be established, and more limited authority is desired, a new
application complying with the provisions of this rule in all respects
and making reference to the previous authority shall be filed.

made a part thereof) for permission to change charges or regulations,
on less than statutory notice or for waiver of the provisions of Tariff

(Notary Public)
My commission expires


Rule 15. (a) Section 204 of the Act empowers the Commission,
either upon complaint or upon its own motion to suspend the opera-
tions of proposed charges, regulations, classifications, or practices
pending investigation of the lawfulness thereof. Whenever an order
of suspension is received by a carrier against whose schedules the
order of suspension is directed, it shall be the duty of such carrier to
file immediately a supplement which shall bear no effective date, but
shall announce to the public and to the Commission that such sched-
ules are suspended until the date stated in the order of suspension;
and reference in such supplement shall be made to the tariffs or sup-
plements where schedules remaining in effect will be found during
the period of suspension or until further ordered by the Commission.
(i) When the order of the Commission directs the suspension of a
part of a publication which, except as to such part, is allowed to be-
come effective, the supplement announcing the suspension shall also
contain in reissued items the charges and regulations applicable dur-
ing the period of suspension, or shall make specific reference by
F. C. C. number or numbers, to the tariff, or supplements where they
will be found.
(c) When the Commission has suspended a supplement in whole or
in part, it may occur that prior to the filing of the supplement an-
nouncing suspension, a carrier will file a later supplement containing,
as reissues, the matter suspended in the previous supplement. In
such instances the suspension supplement required by these rules shall
also specifically cancel from the later supplement such reissued mat-
ter, and by amendment to the title page of said later supplement
shall eliminate the cancellation of the suspended supplement when
the latter is suspended in full, and when a supplement is suspended
in part shall provide that such later supplement cancels such pre-
vious supplement except portions under suspension. Tardiness in
filing supplements announcing suspension may result in the rejection
by the Commission of the supplement which cancels the suspended
matter.
( d ) When the Commission suspends schedules in tariffs or supple-
ments the Commission’s rule relating to amount of supplemental
matter allowed will be waived.
(e) If upon final determination by the Commission matter sus-
pended is found not unlawful, and the Commission directs that the
order of suspension be vacated or the case dismissed,"the affected car-
rier or earners shall issue a supplement or revised page announcing
the vacation of the order of suspension and provide by proper pub-
lication for the application of the lawful schedules and otherwise
comply with such orders of the Commission as it may make.
