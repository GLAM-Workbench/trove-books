INTRODUCTION.
The following pages, written at the request of the Hon. the Minister
for Mines and Works, are designed to give an idea of the present
condition and value of the various mineral fields of Queensland,
with an indication of localities where minerals still await the atten-
tion of miners and capitalists.
The Statistics are chiefly taken from the Annual Reports of the
Department of Mines, and the rest of the information has been, as far
as possible, derived from Official Reports. In the earlier years of
Mining, however, Returns were not regularly made, and I have in
some cases been compelled to resort to unofficial (though, I believe,
reliable) sources.
This pamphlet is illustrative of the large “ Index Map to the
Mineral Wealth of Queensland,” hung in the Queensland Court of
the Centennial Exhibition, Melbourne. In the index at the end of
the pamphlet the Mineral Fields are arranged in alphabetical order,
•and a list of latitudes and longitudes is appended to enable the reader
to locate the places on the map.
The various fields described in the pamphlet are coloured on the
map so as to show the areas where the mineral in question has actually
been worked. The coloured areas bear no relation to the legal
boundaries of the fields.

GOLDFIELDS.
Charters Towers and Cape’ Goldfields.
'These goldfields, although both geographically and geologically
distinct, are generally grouped together. They have for the greater
part of their existence been in the charge of the same Warden, and
the Returns from each have not always been kept separate. The Cape,
although at one time a rich alluvial field, has of late years dimin-
ished in relative importance, so that at the present day its output
does not seriously affect the total yield of the two fields.
In Daintree’s “ Report on the Cape River Diggings,” &c.
(Brisbane: By authority, 1868), it is said that payable gold
deposits were “ confined to the South Eastern outcrops of a vast
thickness of schistose rocks developed on the ‘ Capethe North
Western extension of the same having failed to yield the precious
metal in remunerative quantities to the prospector.” The metamorphic
schists are divided by him into “Upper,” “Middle,” and “Lower.”
The “Upper” is composed of hard quartzites and silicified mica slates.
The “Middle” consists of soft thin-bedded mica-slates, with occasional
bands of silicified mica and hornblende schists. In the Lower
Subdivision laminated granite, mica and hornblende slates are inter-
stratified ; and it is in this portion of the series that transmutation
of the schistose rocks is most marked. Indeed, near the junction of
the schistose and granite rocks, so great has been the alteration that
it is difficult to say where the schists end and the granite commences.
“No fossils have yet been, or are likely to be, met with in these
beds on account of their metamorphic character throughout. The
only assertion to be made in regard to their age is, that rocks of a
similar character further North are unconformably overlaid by others
containing abundance of Upper Silurian fossils.”*
In the map attached to the Report the metamorphic rocks are
provisionally classed as “ Lower Silurian,” The Report further men-
tions that where elvan or porphyritic dykes traverse the metamorphic
rocks, the richest gold deposits were always found. In some cases
there was reason to suspect that “ the rich quartz veins were a con-
tinuation to the surface of the elvan veins themselves.”
Eree gold is found in the alluvia of the present watercourses,
generally in the vicinity of rich quartz reefs. But an older fragmentary
drift, which Mr. Daintree calls Pliocene, yields gold of a rounded water-
worn character, independent of any local source of supply. Several well-
defined “ leads ” are mentioned, which, “ Down the Cape so far as
* Mr. Daintree probably referred to the Broken River, where rocks of a
similar character are overlaid unconformably by a limestone charged with
fossils. The fossils, however, turned out to be Devonian.


the Lower Diggings,” and down Running Creek as far as the junction
of Golden Gully, may be considered as the representative of old river
channels ; beyond these points, to the South and East, it can be re-
garded in no other light than that of accumulated sediment from a
vast lake or sea. It has been found in working that where this
supposed old Avatercourse is narrowest the gold is most concentrated;
but when it becomes broader and the drift deeper, the gold is found
to be too scattered to pay for the additional cost of mining. In 1867
the Warden estimated the population of the Cape at 900 Europeans
and 100 Chinese, but gave no estimate of the gold produced. Before
the Department of Mines began (in 1877) to publish Annual Reports,
the population and production had greatly declined. In 1878 the
population was estimated at 50 Europeans and 45 Chinese, and the
production of gold at 3,000 oz.; in 1879, the estimated yield Avas
2,4000 z.; in 1880, 1,0570 z.; in 1883, l,000oz.; in 1884, 1,9440 z.;
in 1885, 8770 z.; in 1886, 500 oz.
The Charters Towers Field ranks third among Australian
gold-producing areas, being only surpassed by Ballarat and Sand-
hurst. It will be seen, that the above Returns from the Cape are so
small as scarcely to affect the totals credited to Charters Towers.
The richest part of the goldfield lies on the Western edge of a
large area of granitic rock. The granite varies from a type in which
orthoclase felspar, mica and quartz are the essential minerals, and
hornblende an occasional or accidental mineral, to a type in which,
in addition to the constant orthoclose and quartz, hornblende is the
essential and mica the occasional mineral.
West of the granite several reefs are worked in less highly
metamorphosed rocks, but not only are these reefs less rich in gold,
but the gold is also more alloyed Avith silver. These rocks consist of
quartzites, greywackes (of mixed quartz, felspar, and hornblende
granules, with some micd), shales and slates. The slates and shales
are highly impregnated Avith iron peroxide. The stratified rocks
strike as a rule North West and South East, and dip at 0A 7 er45 deg. to
North East and South West. They afford no direct evidence of their
age, but are covered unconformably by the Devonian limestone of
Burdekin Downs.
About 16 miles south of Charters Towers gold occurs in thready
hasmatite veins, which reticulate through a volcanic “ Neck,” named
Mount Leyshon. This neck has been pierced partly through grey-
wackes and slates, and partly through a porphyry. The porphyry is
composed of straw-coloured silicated felspar, with crystals of orthoclase
felspar and quartz, the latter occurring, however, most frequently in
rounded blebs. It sends out v r eins through the greywackes and slates,
and also through the granite Avhich occurs to the North. The “ Neck ”
is the once deep-seated pipe or core of a Amlcano, filled up Avith the
fragmental material Avhich supplied the ashy outbursts. This
material varies considerably in texture, some portions being merely
aggregations of fine felspathic dust, while others are agglomerates of


coarse angular debris of broken porphyry, cemented together by a
sparse matrix of dust felted with iron oxide. Broken crystals and
rounded blebs of quartz are scattered throughout the matrix ; in fact,
the mateiial is exactly such as could be manufactured from the waste
of the porphyry. Crystals of felspar in some cases appear to have
been developed in the ash, so that but for the granular and clastic
appearance of the matrix, the resemblance to the adjacent porphyry
rocks would be complete. The rock will just about pay for passing
through the stamps as a whole, picking the auriferous veins being an
impossibility. JNow and then larger masses of auriferous stone are
met with. Jn the lower levels auriferous iron and copper pyrites
begin to be met with, and it is possible that deposits concentrated in
reefs will be discovered. The Neck is of considerable extent, covering
nearly 200 acres, and is auriferous from its Northern end to its South
Western extremity (Wallaby Point). It is singular that in the
adjacent twin neck, Mount Mawe, the existence of payable gold has
not yet been proved.
The reefs in the central portion of Charters Towers have no
uniform trend, but take as a whole a sort of arrangement in the form
of a horse-shoe, with the toe lying to the South West. The reefs
forming the Western limb run from North North West to South South
East, and those forming the Eastern limb from North North East to
South South West. All underlie at low angles Eastward, Northward, or
Westward towards the axial line of the horse-shoe. Some of the
most important reefs, such as the Day Dawn and Queen, are cross
reefs. Down to the water-level the gold was “ free ”in a gangue of
granitic debris and quartz, mixed with “ brown-stone ” or decomposed
pyrites. Below that level the gold occurs in quartz associated with
a “ Mundic ” composed of pyrites, galena, and zinc-blende, which has
not proved hard to treat.
The tables given by the Warden show that different mines come
to the front year by year. At present the Day Dawn line is first
favorite. In 1884, 1885, and 1886, the Day Dawn P.C. turned out
94,2710 z.; the Day Dawn Block and Wyndham, 86,7880 z.; and the
Victory, 14,2760 z. of gold; in 1885 the Eastward Ho gave 8,3890 z.;
in 1886 the Black Jack gave 8,8340 z.; in 1885 and 1886 the North
Queen yielded 16,0890 z., and the Bonnie Dundee 7,9190 z.
The total yield of Charters Towers and the Cape up to 31s
March, 1888, is estimated at 1,637,8700 z. How much of this came
from the Cape it is now impossible to say. During late years the
amount has been comparatively insignificant, but it is probable that
for the six or seven years prior to the opening of Charters Towers (in
1872) it was of considerable importance.
From the following table of average crushings it will be seen that
the yield from the stone at the deeper levels shows rather an increase
than a decrease during the 11 years since the tables have been
published. One mine has now reached a depth of over 1,400 ft.

Ravenswood Goldfield.
The country rock of this goldfield is a grey syenitic granite, in
which hornblende accompanies or takes the place of mica. Actinolite
is sometimes substituted for the hornblende. The reefs belong to two
distinct systems, one running North and South and underlying to the
Bast, and the other running East and West and underlying to the
South. They generally have a quartoze gangue, and contain iron and
copper pyrites, arsenical pyrites, zinc blende, galena, &c., as well as
gold. This complex “ Mundic,” when exposed to alternate atmos-
pheric and aqueous influences, is decomposed, the metallic com-
pounds being oxidised and the gold set free, and consequently the
field was a favourite “ poor man’s diggings ” till the water level was
reached. At that level, however, the majority of the mines suffered
a severe check, as it was found to be impossible to save more than a
small proportion of the gold by amalgamation. The products of
some of the richer mines were for a time sent to Europe for treat-


tnent, but many of the others which had paid well in the “ brown-
.stone ” did not produce a sufficient quantity of rich ore to yield a
profit after paying expenses, of which the carriage to the coast formed
the heaviest item. Roasting was also resorted to, and was successful
in some cases. Smelting was next tried, but proved too costly.
Chlorination Works are now in course of erection. If this process
should prove equal to the extraction of the gold from what has
hitherto proved an unusually refractory ore, Ravenswood will rank
high among Australian goldfields.
A considerable quantity of alluvial gold has been obtained in
Elphinstone Creek and other streams on the field, mainly by Chinese,
who turn over the wash again and again. Alluvial and reef gold
have, however, not been distinguished in the early Returns, and in
more recent years part of the gold in the alluvia may have been
■derived from

ThisJjGoldfield was only discovered in the end of 1884, and for
Rome time its importance was not recognised. After some extra-
ordinary,[crushings of Croydon stone at the Etheridge, the first


machine was opened on the field in November, 1886, and since then
the prosperity of the place has advanced rapidly. The population
was estimated at 8,000 in December, 1887.
The part of the field surrounding the township lies in granite
country, with which quartzites and other metamorphic rocks are
associated. In the Waterfall district the rock is a hard mass of
finely laminated dust (probably volcanic ) of silicated felspar, with
roundish quartz blebs. Many of the reefs lie rather flat, and this
circumstance gave rise at first to misgivings as to their permanency ;
but this prejudice, like many others, has had to yield to the logic of
facts.
The Township of Croydon is on the very edge of the alluvial flat,
which extends to the Gulf of Carpentaria, The auriferous rocks-
themselves nowhere rise to any considerable elevation. They are
overlaid by isolated fragments of horizontal “ Desert Sandstone.” This
wide-spread formation has hitherto yielded no organic remains of
any value for palaeontological purposes. On the Croydon, however,
the Desert Sandstone is in places crowded with fossils, which Mr.
R. Etheridge, of the Australian Museum, has determined to be of
Upper Cretaceous types —many of the species being identical with
those found in the “Maryborough Beds.” Mr. Wallmann informs me
that in collecting specimens for the Exhibition, he detected gold
actually in some of the fossils. This is the more remarkable as the
reefs do not intersect the Desert Sandstone.
The yield of gold from Croydon for 1887 was 31,7870 z. from
10,950 tons of quartz. The total yield from November, 1886, to
30th April, 1888, is given by the local newspapers as 59,2340zu
Etheridge Goldfield.
The greater part of this extensive field is a coarse-grained granite-
with large crystals of orthoclase felspar and flakes of mica. Of this
granite Mr. Daintree remarks* that it is simply transmuted mica schist,
as shown by the presence of occasional bands of unaltered schist
throughout the mass. The principal drawbacks to the field hitherto'
have been its inaccessibility and the isolated position of the reefs.
Mines, without an output sufficiently large to keep their own
crushing machinery going, have again and again been abandoned
owing to the cost of carriage to the nearest mill. The principal
centres of mining are the Cumberland, Durham, Georgetown,,
Finnegan’s, and Goldsmith’s. The introduction of English capital
attracted by the display at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886-
has begun to tell favourably on the output of the field. The Cum-
berland, one of the most productive mines in the Colony, has an elvan

dyke between the walls, the reef sometimes occupying its upper and
sometimes its lower side. The quartz reefs, except above the water
level, are generally charged with iron pyrites, copper pyrites, arsenical
pyrites, zinc blende and galena, in varying quantities. The mines at
Goldsmith’s form, geologically, part of the Gilbert Goldfield, being
situated in mica-schist country. The stone is less difficult to treat
than that in the granite.
The Etheridge and Gilbert having been, during the greater part
of their history, in charge of the same Warden, the returns from these
fields have been generally lamped together. This is unfortunate for
statistical purposes, as the two fields are geologically distinct. In
the following table the greater part of the reef gold must have come
from the Etheridge, and the greater part of the alluvial gold from the
Gilbert. In 1881 and 1882 the return also includes gold from the
Woolgar. The amount from the Woolgar in 1881 must have been
trifling as the Warden at the end of the year reported that the
crushing machinery was only “ nearly ready.” In 1882 the amount
from the Woolgar was probably about 2,0000 z.

Gilbert and Woolgar Goldfields.
These fields, although conterminous with the Etheridge, differ
from it essentially in their geological characteristics. The divide
between Caledonia Creek (one of the heads of the Delaney River, a
tributary of the Etheridge) and the Robertson River (a tributary of


the Gilbert) is dotted over with little fragmentary tablelands of
Desert Sandstone. The latter formation, as mapped by the late Mr.
Richard Daintree, occupies considerable areas in the Newcastle and
Gregory Ranges, and between Agate Creek and the Percy Rivers
The conglomerate beds of the formation are rich in Agates, topazes,
garnets, and other precious stones, including, it is said, rubies,
sapphires, and diamonds.* Another belt of the Desert Sandstone
makes its appearance on the heads of the Woolgar, where it is capped
by basaltic rocks, probably of Tertiary age. Beneath the Desert
Sandstone lie the metamorphic auriferous rocks of the Gilbert and
Etheridge Goldfields.
According to a Geological Map of the Gilbert, published by
Daintree in 1869, the country near the junction of the Robertson
with the Gilbert is composed of “slates, shales, &c.,” of Lower Silurian
Age skirting West North West. Regarding the age of the rocks in
question, I am not aware that there is any direct evidence beyond
their general lithological resemblance to Victorian Lower Silurian
Rocks. The Upper Waters of the Robertson and heads of the Gilbei’t
are mapped as “ Metamorphic-Mica Schists” striking West South
West. These and the “ slates, shales, &c.,” are penetrated by numerous
dykes of “ elvanite, diorite, hornblende rocks, &c.,” and it is noted
that “ where these elvanites penetrate slates, payable gold is usually
obtained.”
The geological characteristics of the Woolgar Goldfield are
similar to those of the Gilbert,
The Output of the Gilbert is impossible to estimate, as the returns
have been hopelessly mixed up with those of the Etheridge. In 1877
the Warden reported that in the years 1869-1872 the field “ gave em-
ployment to a large number of European and Chinese miners, but
from a variety of reasons it has been entirely abandoned for upwards
of three years, but it is again showing signs of renewed activity.”
During the past year the crushing machine at Mount Hogan has been
put into working order, and 779 tons of quartz, the produce of the
reefs in the vicinity of Mount Hogan and the “ Twenty Mile,”
crushed for a yield of 9940 z. I6dwts of gold. In 1878 there
was a considerable accession to the population engaged in alluvial
working, and preparations were being made to re-open abandoned
reefs. In 1879 the earnings of 500 Chinese were estimated at a
minimum of 7,0000 z of gold. In the same year the Gilberton
Gold Mining Co. crushed 420 tons of stone for a yield of 1420 z.
15dwts. In 1880 the alluvial diggings were estimated to have yielded
6,2600 z. In the Warden's Reports after 1880 no separate estimate
is made. In 1885 the Warden reported that the Mount Hogan and
“ Twenty Mile ” Reefs had crushed during the year 162 tons for
3650 z. of gold.

In the case of the Woolgar, the returns up to 1882 are to some
extent mixed up with those of the Etheridge, hut so far as they can

the Percy River, rich bismuth ore is found in gullies formerly worked

Palmer Goldfield.
The Palmer Goldfield, so far as it has been hitherto opened up,
occupies an area which may be roughly estimated at 2,300 square
miles. This estimate, as in all other cases, has no relation to the
area of the “Proclaimed Goldfield.” The greater part of the Goldfield is
occupied by shales and sandstones in strata, which are tilted up so as
to strike from North and South to North North West and South South
East, nearly vertical but dipping slightly to West and West South West.
Associated with the sandstones, shales, and obviously part of the
same series, is a belt of limestone, traceable from four miles North of
Palmerville Southward to the Mitchell River. These stratified rocks
have not suffered any appreciable degree of metamorphism ; but, owing
to lateral pressure the shales have occasionally been cleaved so as to
become true “ slates.” They are traversed by dykes of igneous rocks
(dolerite and diorite) of much later date. Regarding the age of
the stratified rocks no direct evidence has yet been discovered, the
shales and sandstones having yielded only undistinguishable plant-
remains, and the limestones only traces of encrinites and corals of
indeterminable genera, From the lithological resemblance of some
of the beds, however, to others found in the Hodgkinson Goldfield, it
may be inferred that the Palmer rocks are identical with those of the
Hodgkinson, whose age will afterwards be discussed.
Ninety-four per cent, of the gold hitherto obtained from the
Palmer has been alluvial gold. The reefs in the neighbourhood of
Maytown generally strike West North West and North North West,
and underlie toward the South and West. Those at Limestone maybe
arranged in three groups —the first, running North and South and
underlying to the West; the second, East and West, and underlying
to the North : the third, North East and South West, some underlying
North West and some South East. These reefs, although only recently
opened, promise to be among the richest in the colony. The
Normanby group of reefs follows no definite rule in the bearing and
underlie.
As will be seen from the following table, the reefs have yielded,
from 1874 to 1887 inclusive, 75,3930 z. of gold. The yield from this
source reached its maximum in 1876, the third year of working.
This was owing, in the first place, to the ease with which gold could
be extracted from the surface stone, and in the second place to the
comparatively large number of European Miners then on the field,
who had been originally attracted by the alluvial diggings. The
reefs, however, at present show signs of increased activity and pro-
ductiveness.
The production of Alluvial Gold reached its maximum in 1875,
the third year of the existence of the field. The bulk of the total
output of 1,196,7790 z. of alluvial gold from 1873 to 1877 has, unfor-
tunately, been reaped by Chinese.

North of the Palmer River, the auriferous rocks are covered by
a horizontal cake of the Desert Sandstone (Upper Cretaceous). This
Desert Sandstone, there are cogent geological reasons for believing,
may cover extensive deep leads of concentrated auriferous wash,
which may yet prove even richer than the old alluvial diggings of the
Palmer. ■ It may he mentioned that the alluvial gold in many cases is
found in localities where it is impossible to believe that it can have
come from local reefs ; and everything points to the old land surface
now covered by the Desert Sandstone as its original source.

Coen Goldfield.
As an alluvial field, the Coen had a short existence (from Febru-
ary to July, 1876). The country rock is granite, greywacke, mica
schist and quartzite. The alluvial gold was poor in quality and
insufficient in quantity. Several reefs occur in the neighbourhood
of the diggings. One of these, the Llankelly, is now being worked
profitably.
Hodgkinson Goldfield.
This goldfield extends from the divide between the head of the
Hodgkinson River and Leadingham Creek (an affluent of the Walsh
River) North Westward for about 40 miles down the valley of the
Hodgkinson.
There is a well-marked connection between the geological struc-
ture of the field and its physical features. The stratified rocks


consist of clay shales, greywackes composed of grains of a basic felspar,,
and a hornblendic rock, with minute flakes of mica and grains of
quartz, quartzose grits and conglomerates. The strata have a general
North West and South East strike, and dip, usually, at a high angle to
the North East. In the central portion of the field the total thickness
of strata exposed has been calculated at 21,000 feet, although neither
top nor bottom has been recognised.
The nearly parallel valleys of Caledonia Creek (Glen Mowbray)
and the Hodgkinson River are hounded on the North Eastern side by
the Mount McGann Range, and on the opposite side by the Mount
Robert Range. These ranges have had their trend determined
indirectly by the forces which compressed the strata of the district
from South West to North East, and threw them into long folds from
South East to North West. After the strata had been compressed into
nearly as small a space as they could be made to occupy, i.e , until
they became nearly vertical, the further operation of the same pres-
sure resulted in the formation of fissures along lines of weakness,,
which lines of weakness were found in the bedding-planes between
the upturned strata. These fissures, which are nearly parallel with
the outcrops of the strata, have been filled with a rock of great hard-
ness, which, by its power of resisting denudation, has given rise to the-
Mount McGann and Mount Robert Ranges. Both of these ranges-
occur in zones in which the hard rocks in question are closely grouped
together, while the intervening softer “ country ” has been channelled
into deep valleys by the Hodgkinson River and Caledonia Creek-
The material with which the fissures are filled forms veins or dykes,
from 3 to 40 feet in width, of pure silica, in almost all of its various
forms. It frequently resembles quartzite, and occasionally passes
into ribbon jasper and chalcedony. The veins are often so laminated
parallel to their sides as to suggest that they may be beds rather than
veins, but the mode in which they now and then cut across the-
adjacent strata, although preserving a general parallelism, disproves
this theory. Crystallization of the silica is comparatively rare, and
the lamination seems to imply not so much segregation of the silica
from the adjacent strata as deposition of silica during the passage
of copious sheets of hot water charged with the mineral in solution.
The veins are very remarkable features in the landscape and can be
followed from hilltop to hilltop forming, at times, rough insur-
mountable walls a hundred feet high. In other places, denudation has
left their remains on hillsides or hilltops in the form of large cubes
of silica from which the surrounding softer rocks have crumbled
away. These cubes stand up weird and solitary like the “ perched
blocks ”of alpine and arctic lands. The veins extend for very long
distances. One of them has been traced for six miles and is un-
doubtedly much longer. Some, I have been informed, contain a
little gold. Specular iron ore, brown haematite, and binoxide
of manganese are not uncommonly found in cavities in the larger
veins.

The evidence bearing on the age of the stratified rocks of the
Hodgkinson is still incomplete. Remains of a Lepidodendron, probably
L. Australe, McCoy, have been found in the “ Chance ” tunnel. Some
indeterminable corals and a brachiopod, like Rhynchonella, have been col-
lected from a limestone near Beaconsfield. Of more doubtful value are
some reed-like plant remains from shingly pebbles of black shale, and
corals from limestone pebbles, in conglomerates in Glen Mowbray. Had
the plant remains and corajs from the conglomerate pebbles been
recognisable, and of value for palaeontological purposes, there would
still remain doubts as to whether the pebbles were derived from an
older formation. The shale pebbles so strongly resemble some beds of
shales occurring both above and below the conglomerate in which they
occur, and the limestone pebbles so strongly resemble the limestone
of Beaconsfield, that I believe both have been derived from contem-
porary and not from pre-existing deposits. Lepidodendron is a
characteristic fossil in the “ Star Beds ” (Lower Carboniferous), but
has never been traced upward into the productive portion of the Coal
Measures (Carbonifero-Permian or “ Bowen River Beds”). It seems
most convenient for the present to regard the Hodgkinson Beds as
part of the missing strata represented by the unconformability between
the Burdekin Beds (Devonian), and the overlying “ Star Beds.”
The auriferous reefs are divisible into two natural groups. Those
of the first group coincide with the strike of the stratified rocks, and
underlie at right angles to the dip of the strata. This circumstance
points to the continuance of the pressure which tilted up the strata to
the point when it had to find relief in fissures and “ thrust-planes.” The
reefs of the second group run mainly at right angles to the out-crops
of the stratified rocks. They probably are newer than the first group.

* Deduced from figures on p. 11 of Report of the Department of Mines for 1884,
t Deduced from figures in Report on the Hodgkinson Goldfield. By Robert
L. Jack, 1884.


The total amount of gold won from the Hodgkinson from 1876 to
1887 inclusive, as will be seen from the foregoing table, has been
216,9110 z. The alluvial gold has not always been estimated by the
Wardens, but it probably amounted to about 50,0000 z. for the above
period.
Mulgrave Goldfield.
The Mulgrave River has evidently at one time entered the sea
in Trinity Bay, but has been deflected’—probably by the flows of
basalt which fill up its valley down to the point where it turns sharply
round to the South to flow into the sea at Port Constantine. It is a
magnificent river, and drains the North side of Mount Bartle Prere,
the eastern edge of the Barron Tableland, both sides of the Bellenden-
Ker Ranges, and the Western slopes of the Malbon-Thompson
Range. The “Lower Camp,” or Coldsborough, is on the left bank of
the river, at its junction with Toohey Creek. The Upper Camp is
about six miles South of Coldsborough, on the spur dividing Toohey
Creek and the Mulgrave. The walls of the Mulgrave Valley are
mainly of greywacke, slate and quartzite; but between the Lower
and Upper Camps flows of Basalt fill up the lower portions of the
Mulgrave and Toohey Creek Valleys. In following the track
from the Upper Camp to Herbeiton the stratified rocks continue to
the edge of the Basaltic tableland of the Barron. The “ Fisheries ”
track from the Mulgrave to Herberton, on the other hand, makes its
ascent to the edge of the Basalt tableland over granitic rocks. These
are evidently two distinct periods of basaltic outflows; the first,
that which “ levelled up ” the Barron Tableland, and the second, that
which choked up, at least for a time, the Mulgrave and other valleys,
which had been carved out of the tableland.
A good deal of gold has been got in the alluvia of the Mulgrave
at and below Coldsborough, but no accurate statistics are now obtain-
able. No serious attempt has as yet been made to search for gold
beneath the newer basalt. The same may be said in this locality of
the older basalt of the tableland, although the latter is continuous
with the basaltic flows of the Upper Russell, beneath which payable
drifts have been recently discovered.
At the Lower Camp are the Alice Reef, underlying to South
South East at 70 degrees (coincident with the bedding of the slates
and greywackes), the Cairns Co-operative Co.’s Reef, vertical and
running West South West. At the Upper Camp are the Homeward
Bound, Orient, Mowbray, Mabel, Scandinavian, and others. The
reefs resemble in many points those of the Hodgkinson, and, although
they cover only a limited area, some of them are likely to prove rich.
The following information regarding the yield of the Mulgrave
is all that can be extracted from the Wardens’ Reports, which are
evidently imperfect, especially as regards alluvial gold obtained in
the early days of the field.

Russell
River
Goldfield,
This is a recently opened alluvial field which is likely to rise into
pre-eminent importance. Its centre is about six miles west of Mount
Bartle Frere. The gold is found associated with fine-grained stream
tin ore in a gravelly wash beneath basaltic flows, about 2,500 feet
above the.sea level. This basalt forms part of the tableland which
extends from the heads of the Russell, Johnstone, and Mulgrave to
,the basin of the Barron, near Herberton, and is covered with dense
tropical jungle and intersected by plentiful running streams. It
probably dates, like the Victorian basalts overlying auriferous drifts,
from Miocene times, but of this no direct evidence has yet been
observed. Wairambar Creek, on the West, and Cooppooroo Creek, on
the East, have cut through the basalt, exposing the underlying
auriferous drift and the “ bedrock ” of slates, schists and greywackes.
Extensive preparations for sluicing the drifts have recently been
made, and as the area covered by the basalt is enormous, and the
drift has been exposed owing to the accident of denudation merely on
the fringe of the deposit, almost unlimited possibilities are before the
field. The average yield from washdirt reported in Victoria for
1883 was I dwt. 23.32 grains ; for 1884, 3 dwts., and for 1885, 1 dwt.
10.59 grains. lam certain that the terraces of the Russell will give
:a. much higher yield than this, and there is no comparison between
the extent of the auriferous areas of Victoria and those of the
Russell.
Gold and stream tin ore are found in the beds and alluvial flats of
the lower Russell and the Johnstone. No reefs of any importance
have yet been found in the district, and it is probable that the gold
has been mainly derived from the denudation of the drifts beneath
the basalt.


Cloncurry Gold and Copper Fields.
The greater part of this extensive area is covered by highly-
inclined slates, quartzites, and greywackes, with occasionally a bed of
limestone. These have so far proved unfossiliferous, and there is no
distinct evidence of their age. These rocks form, as it were, a
peninsula extending South-Eastward from the North West corner of
the colony, and projecting into the Cretaceous Rocks of the “ Rolling
Downs ” formation. In the neighbourhood of the Mount Douglas
gold mines, the country is studded with rugged knobs of granular
quartzite, which may represent the discharge pipes of geysers. The
field is intersected with enormous siliceous veins like those of the
Hodgkinson Goldfield. A few small isolated tablelands of the Desert
Sandstone attest the former extension of that formation.
The Gold mines have been worked in a desultory and unsatis-
factory manner, for which the position of the field is no doubt in
large measure to blame. The Gilded Rose, on Fisher’s Creek, in a
country-rock of flaggy talcose sandstones and shales, has been most
persistently worked. The reef is highly charged with pyrites. The-
Carbonates of Copper in the Homeward Bound and Flying Dutchman
Lodes contain a good deal of gold. In the Uncle Tom, on Pumpkin.
Gully, the gold is associated with quartz, carbonate of lime, and
carbonate of iron. In the Mary Douglas, at the “ Top Camp,” rich
deposits of gold, associated with native bismuth, have been obtained
from quartz coated with botxyoidal and stalagmitic masses of glossy-
black limonite. The gullies and flats radiating from the Mary
Douglas Hill have yielded rich alluvial gold, all heavy and nuggetty r
and frequently so coated with iron oxides that He miners knew it as-
“ black gold.” One nugget weighed 281 b. Alluvial gold, with
native bismuth, is extensively distributed in the Pumpkin Gully
region, and would pay well to work by hydraulic power, if it couldi
be brought to bear.
The total amount of alluvial gold reported since 1877 is 3,0230z. r
but it is obvious that the returns are very incomplete. The total
amount of reef gold from 1877 to 1886 i54,3920z., but, as the amount
of stone crushed is not in all cases given, the yield per ton cannot
now be estimated.
The Cloncurry field contains some very extensive deposits of
copper ore. The chief of these are the Great Australian and the
Argylla. The copper is in the form of Carbonates and red oxides.
The latter ore, of which there are enormous deposits, is frequently
richer than chemically pure red oxide, being mixed up with native
copper. The Great Australian is the only Mine which has yet been
worked to any extent, and has produced, in 1885-7, 3,250 tons of ore,
valued at £33,520. This return is singularly small, but the low-
price of copper for some time past, when taken in connection with
the expense of land carriage, sufficiently accounts for the restriction
of the output, pending the construction of a railway to the coast.

Argentiferous lead lodes occur on the field, chiefly in the Dugald
Valley. One of these, still unworked, is over a mile in length.
The most striking features of the country are mountains of pure
specular and magnetic iron ore. One of these —Mount Leviathan —
is about 200 ft. high, and a quarter of a mile in diameter at its base.
It is singular to reflect that these deposits, which, if they were located
in England, would be colossal fortunes for their owners, are at present
absolutely valueless owing to their geographical position.

McKinlay Goldfield
This field is believed by many to be a promising one, but has not
as yet been steadily worked. Several reefs have given good returns
for a time, and a considerable quantity of alluvial gold has been won,
but no record appears to have been kept. The country-rock is said by
Daintree to be of metamorphic rocks (gneiss and mica and talc
schists). “ The associated minerals are gold and copper, the presence
of i dykes ’ of intrusive material seeming l to be the chief cause of
mineralisation.” (General Report upon the Northern District.
Brisbane:: By authority, 1870.)


Normanby and Marengo Goldfields.
Normanby.
There are no less than three Goldfields in the Colony known as
Normanby. The one here referred to lies about 40 miles South of
Bowen, on the heads of the Dart and Grant, tributaries of the Broken
River.
The goldfield occupies a portion of the Claidce Range. That
range consists almost entirely of metamorphic rocks. That these have
undergone metamorphism, followed by extensive denudation, prior to
Carboniferous times, is proved by the relations they bear to the Bowen
River Coalfield. There is much probability, but no direct evidence, in
favour of a pre-Devonian metamorphism. In some places shales,
slates, quartzites, greywackes, lydian-stone, and mica and hornblende-
schists are met with ; and there is little doubt that the whole table-
land was originally composed of stratified rocks. In the immediate
neighbourhood of Normanby, however, the occurrence of stratified
rocks is notably rare, and the country-rock mostly consists of a
species of porphyry, composed of quartz, black mica (sparsely), and
crystals of schorl. The whole rock is mixed up with minute crystals
and streaks of pyrites, and streaks and veins of serpentine. Occasional
sections show a passage from greywacke to the rock just described.
In 1872-3 the Hibernia, Grace Darling, Marquis, Welcome, Star
of Hope, Albion, New Zealand, Venture, and other reefs were at
work, and everything went well till the water level was reached,
crushings of from loz. to being the usual return. At the water-
level, however, “Mundic” took the place of the easily-reduced “brown-
stone,” and as at the time the treatment of Complex auriferous ores
was little understood the claims one after another were abandoned,
although the stone assayed sometimes as much as Bfoz. to the ton.
The field is suffering from an unjustly acquired bad reputation ; had
it been discovered 15 years later, it would probably have entered at
once on a course of unchecked prosperity.
Now that miners have seen what can be done with mundic stone
in other places, a number of the old hands have resumed work,
believing (with good reason) in the future of the field. Several new
reefs have also been opened up, and some show at the surface very
good prospects. The assistance of capital, however, is absolutely
necessary at the present juncture, the old machines having been
removed to other fields. Probably the mundic stone will have to be
treated by chlorination.
From 1877 to 1883 the Annual Reports of the Department of
Mines give the following statistics of gold from “ Normanby, Marengo,

and was probably chiefly alluvial gold :
OZ.
This small field lies about 23 miles South West of Bowen, on a
low tableland dividing the head waters of the Bogie from the parallel
valley of the Don. The lithological description of this limited area
may be applied to the whole of the range between the Burdekin and
the ('oast —essentially a white granite, in which the mica is sometimes
supplemented and occasionally replaced by hornblende, frequent
bosses of intrusive pale pinkish felspar-porphyry (the felspar highly
acidic), and occasional small areas of gneiss and mica-schist and of
unmetamorphosed, or at least still recognisable, shales and greywackes.
About a dozen reefs were worked for a short time from 1871,
but proved too poor for profitable working at the time, the crushings
varying from 3dwt. to a little over loz. per ton. The Caps of the
reefs showed a good deal of carbonate of copper, and the gold was
soon found to be mixed with copper and iron pyrites. With
economical working, Marengo and numerous other fields similarly
situated will some day pay to work. One or two of the reefs are
good enough to pay now, but could not bear by themselves the whole
of the expenses necessary to put the field in going order. A goldfield
in its infancy offers an exception to the usual laws of trade. The
mines must bear in common the expenses of the machinery, &c M
without which they are themselves worthless. Instead, therefore, of
there being a struggle for existence, each individual miner is directly
interested in his neighbour’s prosperity.
Nebo (Mount Britton) Goldfield.
The reefs of the Mount Britton Goldfield occur partly in diorite
and partly in grey and black shales and sandstones. The stratified
rocks belong, like the Gympie Goldfield, to the Bowen River Beds
(Carbonifero-Permian), and the igneous rocks appear to be partly
interbedded and partly intrusive. The field was opened in 1881 as
an alluvial “ diggings,” and has yielded some large nuggets —690 z.,
500 z., 450 z., 400 z., and 350 z.) —with but a small proportion of fine
gold. Two groups of reefs, one at the head of Nuggetty Gully and
the other about three-quarters of a mile to the South, are being


worked, and have yielded some rich crushings. Except the totals
for the different years, no returns have been furnished by the
Wardens. In the latter half of 1883, the Little Wanderer Reef
crushed 421 tons of stone for 2,4160 z. of gold. A third group of
reefs, near Mount Clarke, looks as if it might yet prove valuable.
Yield of Mount Britton Goldfield.
Yatton Goldfield.
The recently opened goldfield of Yatton is in a dioritic country
rock, intersected by dykes of silicated felsite. Some of the auriferous
reefs, such as the St. Catherine, follow the usual laws of such de-
posits, but the majority are peculiar as regards the conditions under
which the gold is found. The gangue stuff (which is generally com-
posed of brecciated lumps of diorite) is veined with calcite and decom-
posed concretionary carbonate of lime, and occasional aggregations of
carbonate of iron (siderite) and decomposed orthoclase felspar are met
with. Some of the stone, composed of mixed quartz and r-eddish
ferruginous carbonate of lime, shows gold very freely. The gold is
flakey, like gold leaf. The reefs are as yet too undeveloped to say
much about. 136 tons crushed in 1877 gave 74ozs. of gold, but these
figures give no idea of the yield of the field, as the richest parts of
many of the reefs probably never passed through the stampers. A
good deal of alluvial gold had been taken from Yatton seven years
before the proclamation of the field. The reefs are not yet suffi-
ciently developed to give a true idea of their value, as they are
mostly of a character of which miners have had little experience.
Peak Downs Goldfield.
The reefs in this goldfield occur in an area of crumpled
and fissured raetamorphic schists, slates, &c., near the township
of Clermont. Daintree, in his “ Geology of Queensland ” (Quart.
Journ. Geol. Soc., vol. xxviii., p. 301), refers these rocks to the


Lower Silurian Series, or even to the still older metaraorphic
•system of Victoria, but the only direct evidence of their age
is that a bed of limestone, apparently of Devonian age (Bur-
•dekin Beds)., appear to lie unconformably on them. “The principal
reefing country lies to the South of Clermont, and extends from two
to three miles West of Copperfield to Macdonald’s Flat, a distance of
about seven miles. The reefs have a general East and West trend.
In none of them can the work be said to have gone beyond the
prospecting stage. I must point out that the depth to which these
reefs have been tried exceeds in no case 150 ft. or 160 ft., and only in
a few cases has this depth been The returns of the crush-
ings, too, that have been kept do not give a fair account of their
average yield of gold, for the returns of the earlier and best crush-
ings have been lost. I certainly am of opinion that some of them
will be found payable at deeper levels.”
“ Most, or I might say practically all, of the gold sent away from
this field has been the yield of alluvial workings. Ever since the
jear 18G2, when the first rush took place, thousands of ounces of
alluvial gold have yearly been obtained. The returns of the gold sent
away in earlier years have not been preserved. The yield, however,
was much larger than of late years. This falling off has been caused,
to a preat extent, by the dearth of water.”
In addition to diggings in the recent alluvia of the gullies on both
sides of the Drummond Range, gold has been obtained in large
quantities from drifts covered by a flow of basalt. “ The Victoria
Lead ” has been, perhaps, the richest deposit of gold in the district.
At the summit of the hill, where the workings on it started, the wash-
dirt was only 15 or 2D feet deep. About three-quarters of a mile to
the North, where it ran under the Basalt, it was 100 feet deep.
Its average width is from 20 to 30 feet. A 30oz. Nugget
was obtained from near the head of the lead. The Washdirt
is said to have averaged l|oz. to the load, all the way through, and
24 loads in one part went Boz. per load. Daintree, in his “ Geology
of Queensland,” says, with reference to the volcanic outbursts : “ The
more Northern Volcanic Areas, those shown on the map North of lat.
21 c , are probably contemporaneous with the Upper Volcanic Series of
the Victorian Geologist, and are probably of Pliocene Tertiary age.
The Southern areas, viz., Peak and Darling Downs, &c., are older,
agreeing with the Lower Volcanic of Victoria, which have been ejected
through fissui’es, and have in no case a very extensive flow beyond the
line of fracture through which they have issued. These may be re-
ferred to the Miocene epoch.”
A still older, and in some respects a very remarkable, auriferous
drift occurs in the Cement Hill, at Hurley’s, and at the Four-Mile.
Cement Hill is described as consisting of, “ Firstly, from 15 to 30 feet,
of a conglomerate, composed of boulders and pebbles of schists and
small quartz pebbles, the whole cemented together by a clayey cement
formed by the disintegration of the schists itself. This conglomerate


is soft, but very tough to work in.. The bottom 4or 5 feet forms the
washdirt in which the gold is found. Secondly, underlying the con-
glomerate is a fine-grained silt or shale from 1 to 4 feet in thickness,
termed by the miners ‘ dig,’ which is cut away to facilitate the
bringing down of the wash above. Lastly, another drift of smaller
pebbles and not auriferous. This rests on the auriferous schists of
the district. The ‘ dig ’ contains Glossopteris, the characteristic
plant of the Bowen River and Newcastle (N.S.W.) Beds, and there-
fore the deposit appears to belong to Carbonifero-Permian Series. The
auriferous portion of the upper conglomerate or drift is said to con-
tain, as an average, about 5 or 6 dwts of gold per ton.”*
Coal has been found beneath the basalt within a few miles of
Clermont. The Peak Downs Copper deposits will be referred to
under another head.
The Returns from the Peak Downs Goldfield are very imperfect.
Per the first 15 years of the history of the field I can only find one
record by the Warden (of 4,9000 z. escorted in 1867.) It cannot
possibly be over the mark to fill up the blanks in the record as I
have done by taking 4,0000 z as the average Annual Yield from
1862 to 1866 inclusive, and 3,0000 z. Annually from 1868 to 1876-
inclusive. The recorded returns, with these additions, give a total
yield of 104,4830 z. of gold. Gold to the amount of 6,0790 z. is re-
turned as the yield of 12,266 tons of quartz crushed, but it must be
remembered that Mr. Rands points out that the records of the earlier
and richer crushings have been lost

Raglan, Calliope, Norton, Cania, and Kroombit
Goldfields.
The Raglan Goldfield has been in existence since 1867. At
the Old Diggings, the Two-mile Diggings, and the Mount Larcombe
Scrub, considerable quantities of alluvial gold have been obtained.
The country-rock consists of grey and siliceous slates, and hardened
sandstones or quartzites, with occasional conglomerates and limestones.-
The limestone contains few fossils, but crinoids are common, and a
species of Aviculopecten, like A. multiradiata, has been detected by
Mr. Rands. This species is common to the Devonian and the Gympie-
Beds ; and the auriferous strata are probably of the age of the latter.
The Duke of Brittany Reef has yielded on an average a little-
over |oz. of gold to the ton. About lOOOoz. were obtained from the-
reof in a few years. Several other reefs have been worked from time
to time. A copper lode has been opened up near the “ Old Diggings.”
Calliope Gpldfield was discovered in 1863. “ Gold has
been obtained in fair quantities in the beds of nearly all the gullies-
heading from the Boyne Range. Amongst those on the Calliope falls
are the Nuggetty Gully, Dogleg Gully, ‘Ten Men’s’ Gully, and Gordon’s
Gully, all of which run Westward into Oakey Creek, in Brennan’s Flat-
The gullies at the head of Brennan’s Flat have also yielded gold, and
in a gully close to the Sheep Station and running East a great amount
of work has been done; the washdirt here was 10 to 12 feet deep.
On the slope of the hill patches of alluvial of an older date than that
in the gullies are now being worked.”
“ Nuggetty Gully, although very patchy, has been the most
productive. In 1866, nearly 600 men were at work in this gully
alone. The number had decreased to about 200 two years later on-
Many nuggets, up to 50z., have been picked up; and an American
Black is reported to have picked up nuggets weighing 14oz. and 730 z.
respectively.
“ On the eastern or Boyne side of the watershed are Machine-
Creek, Tucker’s Gully, Pancake Gully, and New Zealand Gully-
The latter, which was started in 1863, has been by far the most
productive. A large number of men were employed in it in 1872.
“Prom over 800 men in the year 1864, the number has gradually
fallen so that now (1885) scarcely a score are at present at work on
the field. The future of Calliope will depend, therefore, rather on its-
reefs than on its alluvial deposits.
“ The formation consists of metamorphosed rocks, chiefly of
altered grey and greenish slates, with numerous outcrops of limestone
and marble.” These have yielded no recognisable fossils. “ The
country-rock is intersected by dykes and patches of serpentine
diorite and porphyry.”
Mr. Rands, in his report, gives descriptions of the Theresa,-
King’s Gully, The Company’s, Perseverance, Connemara, John Bull,-
Alexandra, Mitchell, and Woods’ Reefs, and observes that “ up to the


present time none of the reefs have had a fair trial. The deepest
shaft is not more than 100 feet in depth ; and, from the information I
could gather, some of them at any rate have been abandoned for
reasons such as want of capital, bad management, high rates for
crushing, &c., and not because they did not contain gold in payable
quantities, if worked in a judicious and economical manner.”
The Norton Goldfield is at present the most prosperous of
the group, probably for the reason that it has been fortunate enough
to attract the attention of men of energy and skill. It was discovered
in 1871, but little work was done till 1879, when a Machine was
erected.
The formation is a grey, medium-grained granite, which passes
in places into syenite and in others into porphyry.
“ The granite is in the form of an eruptive ‘ boss,’ which rises
tthrough and sends out veins into the surrounding slate country.”
“ The granite is intersected by gold-bearing reefs and volcanic
dykes of diorite, porphyry, and dolerite.”
Mr. Rands describes minutely the Advance, Who’d - have -
thought-it, Emu, Never Never, Little Wonder, Chandler’s, Martin’s,
All Nations, Galena, and other reefs. In these the gold is associated
with iron pyrites, arsenical pyrites, zinc-blende, galena, stibnite
(sulphide of antimony), quartz, and calcite. From L 879 to 1884
inclusive, 2,766 tons of stone were crushed for 7,8830 z. of gold, but
.the treatment of the complex mundic proved the chief drawback to
the development of the field. Lately, chlorination has been success-
fully applied to the treatment of the stone, and the field will
probably develop steadily in future.
The country-rock of the Cania Goldfield is described by
Mr. Rands as consisting of alternate layers of sandstone, slates, and
limestone, the latter of a pisolitic structure and in parts fossiliferous.
These rocks are capped by denuded tablelands of “ Desert limestone.”
The limestones have yielded corals and brachiopoda, which render it
.almost certain that the auriferous strata belong to the same age as
the Gympie Reds (Carbonifero-Permian).
“ Colours of gold can be obtained from the drift in the beds of
.any of the creeks or gullies in the district, and most of them have
been worked more or less. On the Cania or Three Moon Creek side
of the watershed, the principal workings are the Four-mile Creek
and its gullies. This creek has yielded large amounts of gold in rich
patches, but it is not at all evenly distributed, and the beds cannot be
any distance. Lower down on the same or west side of the
creek is the Moonlight Gully, which has given perhaps the best
yields on the field, the gold being evenly distributed along the whole
length of it. Phis and also the Chinaman’s, Starlight, and Daylig’ht
Gullies all head from the same hill, around the foot of which the
Three Moon Creek bends. Several reefs occur on this hill, some of
which are being worked. On the other side of the creek, Paddy’s
•Gully has proved the best.”

In the “ Mount Rose ” Reef the gold is.in white quartz ; near the
surface it was found in cal cite. It is “ met with in very rich patches,
and at times over lOOoz. have been broken down in one patch. All
the gold in this reef is coarse in character.” The “ Garry Owen ” and
Mount Hope Reefs crushed over 2oz. to the ton.
“The KrOOlllbit diggings, on the other side of the watershed
and west of Cania, were discovered in February, 1870, just a month
before Cania was opened. Of the gullies on these falls the Roan
Colt and Denny’s have, perhaps, proved the best. They head from a
small round hill which is itself partially covered with alluvial drift to
a depth of 20 feet, which has yielded a fair amount of gold. There is
another round-shaped hill about a mile to the east, which has also a
similar drift on its summit. Gullies running also from the hill have
been payable to work. The drift on these two hills is evidently of a
date anterior to that found in the beds of the present creek or gullies.
It is probably of Post-Tertiary age.”
The above quotations are from Mr. Rand’s “ Report on the Gold-
fields of Raglan, Calliope, Milton (Norton), and Cania, &c ” Brisbane :
By authority, 1885.
The returns from these fields are very incomplete. Prior to 1877
I have only been able to find records of the output of 1866 and 1868',
The best jears of the alluvial diggings, as will be seen from Mr.
Rarid’s report, are omitted. An estimate of 2,0000 z. per annum for
the eleven omitted years is probably well within the mark, and this,-
with the recorded output, brings the total yield up to 57,5100 z.


Rockhampton Goldfields.
Mount Morgan, Crocodile, Rosewood, Morinish, Ridgelands,
and Cawarral,
For tlie last five years the Rockhampton goldfields have prac-
tically meant Mount Morgan, that wonderful mine having dwarfed
everything else in the district into comparative insignificance.
Mount Morgan is a dome-shaped elevation, rising to about 1,200 ft.
.above the level of the sea, and about 500 ft. above the surrounding
tableland.
The tableland is composed of bluish-grey quartzites —fine-
grained siliceous sandstones, more or less vitrified—full of minute
crystals of iron pyrites, and specks of magnetic iron ore, greywaeke
,of the ordinary type, hard fine-grained sandstones of mingled
siliceous and felspathic materials, occasional masses of shale hardened
to a flinty consistency, and a few belts of serpentine. The recent
labours of Mr. James Smith, of Rockhampton, have brought to light
in these rocks an abundant fauna, of species which prove conclusively
that they are part of the same series (Carbonifero-Permian) with the
auriferous rocks of Gympie.
The stratified rocks are intersected in every direction by dykes
and other intrusive masses of dolerite, rhyolite, and other igneous
rocks—the intrusive masses occupying apparently as much space
as the remnant of the original stratified formation itself. This
country rock is traversed by reefs of the usual description, some of
which, though not large, give a high yield of gold per ton.
The upper portion of Mount Morgan consists of a deposit vary-
ing from red and brown hematite on the one hand to a frothy,
spongy cellular siliceous sinter on the other. Fine gold is dissemi-
nated throughout the mass, but it varies considerably in richness.
The average of late is said to be about 7oz. per ton. The gold is the
■purest in the world, being absolutely free from silver. The mining
operations are simply quarrying, and are consequently inexpensive.
The stone is treated by chlorination, and it appears that for years to
come the output depends simply on the amount of stone that can be
put through the process. With the present plant 1,500 tons per
week are manipulated. The mine is held by a company of one million
shares, and the present selling price proves a belief on the part of
investors that the mine is worth £16,000,000.
The origin of this unique auriferous deposit has given rise to
many speculations. My belief is that it is due to a geyser or hot
spring which burst out in Tertiary times after the valley of the Dee
had been carved out of the cake of “ Desert Sandstone,” which once
covei’ed the site of the Mountain, and whose escarpments now look
down on the valley. Mr. J. Macdonald Cameron, M.P., who reported


on the mine in 1887, considered the deposit to be “ one mass of
•tufaceous material from which some of the alkaline constituents of
its felspar were washed out by aqueous percolations.”
Mr. Cameron continues: “Previous to the upheaval by the
igneous disturbances that have also metamorphosed the once stratified
rocks of the district, I picture to myself group after group of quartz
veins of auriferous mundic, varying in width and richness, traversing
-.and intersecting their various lines of stratification. Igneous distur-
bances follow, that disturb and upheave their once regular masses
with abrupt cliffs and prominences. Their sandstones are converted
into quartzites, their soft argillo-arenaceous slates, with their auri-
ferous veins of mundic-charged quartz, are converted into more
crystalline and compact rocks, from which every trace of stratification
has been eliminated. Even the quartz itself becomes more crystalline,
: and the sulphur of its contained mundic is partially, and in some cases
wholly, oxidised—the extent of oxidation being lesser or greater in
proportion as the masses of igneous matter were intrusive or eruptive.
If the former, and my theory, on further examination of the district be
found correct, then the sulphurous condition will continue to ‘ make ’
■the further we recede from the metamorphic, until the original mundic
lode group is reached; but if the latter, metamorphism of the lode-stuff
may continue, even to an unworkable depth, which would be a matter
for congratulation rather than regret, as in this case natural forces
will have continued to do for the auriferous ore of Mount Morgan,
what would otherwise require the skill of the chemist, with a conse-
quent increased cost of treatment.”
At present the mine next in importance to Mount Morgan, in
rthis district, appears to be the Taranganba, on the coast near Yeppoon,
.-although it still awaits development. The owners propose to erect a
plant capable of treating 1,500 tons per week. Mr. J. A. H. T. Ranft,
M.E., in a Report on the property, describes the “ country rock ” as
.consisting of “bands of quartzite, chert, lydianstone, hornstone, jasper,
greasy quartz, milky quartz, ferruginous and granular quartz, inter-
■sections of ferruginous veins and bands, in which limonite forms no
small portion. These rocks have been intersected by a number of
dykes, all of which have a strike nearly magnetic north (N. 4 W.), and
it is to these dykes that the auriferous charging of the rocks is due.”
By assay of specimens taken from a number of places, Mr. Ranft
calculates that large areas of the rocks adjacent to the (porphyry)
dykes will pay well for raising and chlorinating.
The Crocodile Goldfield lies at the foot of the North-West
.escarpment of the tableland on which Mount Morgan is situated, and
can hardly be more than from 1 to 300 feet above the sea level, on the
heads of Gavial Creek, which falls into Keppel Bay (thus proving, by
<the way, the falsity of an obstinate superstition among miners to the
.effect .that payable gold cannot be found on the East coast). This
belief, or rather its logical inference that any gold found on the East


Coast cannot be payable, has exerted a powerful depressing influence-
on all such shows, as miners could hardly be induced to give them a
trial. The prevailing country-rock is granite or syenite, and in this-
are the “ Hector,” “ Who’d-ha’-thought-it,” “ Block and Pillar”, “ Hit
or Miss,” and other reefs. The “ St. Gothard ” and “Bonanza” are
in altered stratified rocks —slates, greywackes, grits, and conglo-
merates —intersected by diorite dykes.
At the Rosewood Goldfield, the “ Golden Bar ” reef is com-
posed for the most part of calcspar and chlorite in pockets, and coating
crystals of calcite. Sometimes there is also a good deal of quartz,
and crystalline pyrites occurs in films on the surface of the veins.
Some very rich bunches of gold have been obtained in calcspar veins'
in this mine.
The reef occurs in a diorite dyke, which is mostly altered to-
chlorite. Rich bunches have also been obtained in the Caledonian
reef, a large body of quartz with patches and pockets of chlorite,-
intersecting highly altered sandstone country.
At Blackfellow’s Gully three reefs, the “ Homeward!
Bound,” “ Carnarvon Castle,” and “ Mary Florence ” have been
worked.
At Morinish the “ Welcome ” Reef has been worked to a depth
of over 350 ft. in a country-rock of fine-grained serpentinous grey-
wacke. The reef is of quartz, with iron pyrites, arsenical pyrites, a
little galena, and a very little zinc blende. It has been worked for
many years with fair success.
At New Zealand Gully is the “ North Star Mine,” in por-
phyry country.
At Cawarral the “Galawa,” “Annie,” “Helena,” and “Annie -
Halliday,” in serpentine country, have yielded good returns.
Most of these small fields have yielded a good deal of alluvial
gold. A nugget weighing 2580 z. lldwts. was found at Mount
Wheeler (Cawarral).
The output of the various Rockhampton Goldfields cannot be
correctly given, as the earlier records are lost in the mists of an
antiquity of thirty years. In 1866, the Warden estimated the amount
of gold at l,ooooz. per week —52,0000 z. for the year. In 1867, the
amount is given at 33,7390 z. In 1868, the total is given at 25,5050 z.,
of which 8,9820 z. were the yield of 7,564 tons of stone crushed. A
total of 111,2440 z. is thus accounted for in three of the years previous
to 1877, when Returns began to be regularly published. It is pro-
bably well within the mark to assume that the total yield for the
period amounted to about 200,0000 z. From 1877 to 1887 inclusive
the total amount of gold produced was 187,2570 z., of which the
greater part must be credited to Mount Morgan.

Mount Shamrock Goldfield.
This Goldfield has only recently been opened, and its output
appears for the first time in 1877, as 3,3480 z. of gold from 3,151 tons
of stone crushed. In the same year five tons of Bismuth ore were
exported.
Mount Shamrock is a low hill about 145 feet in height above the
level of Didcot Creek, which runs at its foot on the eastern side. The
hill consists almost entirely of a dark colored massive slate, which is
intersected by dykes of porphyry. It was on the summit of this hill,
close to where their shaft now is, that the prospectors first dis-
covered the gold in a piece of iron-stained stone lying at the surface.
Mount Shamrock Prospecting Claim.
In a shaft 30 feet deep, “ the following materials were passed
through, in the order mentioned, in layers, all of which were dipping
away steeply to the east:—
“1. A breccia consisting of angular fragments of a fine-grained
aluminous and siliceous rock, cemented together with a hard cement of
oxide of iron and silica, throughout which are numerous blebs of quartz.
“2. A yellow ochre containing a fair percentage of oxide of
bismuth.


“ 3. A brown iron ochre with veins of crystallised glassy quartz-
running through it.
“ These ochres form the principal part of what has been passed
through in the shaft. The two together must be at least 8 feet to 10 feet
in width, and they contain numerous veins and bunches of oxide of
bismuth.
“4. Earthy red hiematite, with siliceous veins containing also
broken particles and blebs of glassy quartz.
“ All these materials contain gold in considerable quantity, the
gold in some places being beautifully crystallised.”
“ Much doubt has been experienced as to the nature of this
deposit. Both from the character of the stone and the regular
manner in which it strikes and dips, I am of opinion that it is a lode,
the breccia being formed by the breaking up and subsequent cement-
ing together of particles of the walls and matrix of the lode. The
fissure in which the lode is formed appears to have acted as the
channel for the passage of water of hot springs to the surface, for all
the materials, the crystallised gold, the hard siliceous and iron cement
of the breccia, and the ochreous materials are such as would have
only been formed by deposition from solution in water.
“ The gold appears to be especially associated with the bismuth,
for the veins of oxide of bismuth are exceptionally rich. A small
sample of the oxide assayed by Mr. Hamilton contained 62 per cent,
of metallic bismuth and 2520 z. of gold per ton of the material.
“ A dyke of white felspar-porphyry can be traced down the hill
from a point immediately south of the shaft in a West-North-West
direction. It is very probable that this dyke may have influenced
the richness of the lode at this point.
“ In No. 1 and No. 2 North small quantities of gold Lave been
found associated with the porphyry dyke.
“ Mount Melville consists of massive blue slates and hardened
sandstones, intersected by dykes of felspar-porphyry of a similar
character, and probably a continuation of those met with in the
northern part of Mount Shamrock. A sample taken from the out-
crop yielded gold equal to about 2oz. 12dwts. I3grs. to the ton, but a
trial crushing of 31cwts. yielded only 4dwts., or a little over
2|dwts. to the ton.
“At the foot of this hill a small reef is being worked. It is
from 2 to 10 inches wide, consisting of quartz with a large percentage
of the oxide of iron and manganese. At the bottom of the shaft, in
one place, there is a vein 1 inch wide consisting almost entirely of
pyrolusite (oxide of manganese.) An assay from this reef gave
Ifidwts. of gold and 6oz. of silver per ton. It intersects a dyke of
porphyry. The footwall is of dolerite.”
“ At Mount Ophir is a large reef of white translucent quartz,
stained in patches with oxide of iron. It contains a good deal of
molybdenite and specks of iron pyrites. At 25 feet a hole was
dialled into the reef; the debris obtained from the hole, on being


■washed, gave a very good prospect indeed. The rock of which this—
the northern—side of Mount Ophir consists is made of fine felspathic
dust containing small and more or less rounded particles of a micro-
crystalline felspathic rock. Fine gold is obtained on crushing and
washing pieces of this rock.” (Report “On the Gold and Silver
Deposits in the neighbourhood of Mount Shamrock.” By W. H.
Rands. Brisbane: By authority, 1886.)
Mr. Rands, in the Report above quoted, gives an account of the
Old Chowey Reefs and Stanton-Harcourt alluvial diggings, and of the
“Allendale,” “ Hannan’s,” “ Union,” “ Lady Mary,” and other silver
lodes. The argentiferous lead ores are associated with arsenical pyrites
and zinc-blende. Mr. Rands observes : “ The amount of silver in the
lodes, as far as assays have at present shown, is small —only from
30oz. to 40oz. to the ton, which of itself will not pay to work, especially
with a narrow reef. They all contain some gold. In the “Allendale,”
which is the only shaft well into the sulphides, the ore contains as
much as loz. of gold to the ton. In 1886, the amount of ore raised
was 75 tons, valued at £1,350. In 1887 the return was nil.”
Eidsvold Goldfield.
“ The country-rock round about Eidsvold consists of granite,
which for the most part is medium-grained, of a pinkish-brown
colour. Its constituents are orthoclase felspar, largish blebs of
quartz, with small crystals of mica (biotite). The rock passes in
parts into a fine-grained syenitic granite of a darkish colour, and
contains hornblende in addition to mica.
“ The reefs are situated in the granite country. They are
running in various directions, though the majority of them have a
North-West to North-North-West bearing. They lie very flatly in
most cases, the underlie varying from 45deg. to 75deg.
“ All the reefs contain a certain amount of mundic ; and, as the
water level has not yet been reached, the quartz is often of an
ochreous or gossany nature from the decomposition of the sulphurets.
It is probable that the reefs will be rich in sulphurets at a depth,
“ Eidsvold, in many respects, somewhat resembles the Charters
Towers Goldfield. The chief points of resemblance are —the country-
rock, which in both places consists to a great extent of granite and
syenite or syenitic granite ; in the flat underlie of the reefs ; and in
the character of the gangue of the reefs, which consists in both
places, to a great extent, of decomposed granite debris with veins of
quartz.
“ Comparatively small amounts of the sulphurets (pyrites and
galena, Ac.) have yet been met with in the Eidsvold reefs, owing, no
doubt, to the fact that the workings have not yet reached beyond the
action of atmospheric influences. The quartz, however, is often
ferruginous, and contains a yellow ochreous material which has been
produced by the decomposition of these sulphurets, which will be


found to exist in larger quantities in the reefs when the water level
is reached. A few of the reefs contain a good percentage of galena,
a mineral of very common occurrence in the Charters Towers Reefs.
Very little copper ore occurs in the reefs. On the other hand,
arsenical pyrites is of common occurrence here in some reefs. Mr,
Jack says in his report on Charters Towers : ‘ Arsenic is scarcely
known in any form on the field.’ I did not meet with any zinc Gre-
at Eidsvold, while sphalerite (zinc-blende j is of common occurrence-
at the Towers.
“ The field, as far as can be gathered from surface indications, is r
with the exception of a few porphyry and syenite dykes, singularly
free from eruptive dykes.
“So far as can be judged from the work already done, the
prospects of Eidsvold as a reefing district are very good.
“ The field will soon have the advantage of a thorough trial, for
two or three batteries will soon be on the field. (“ Report on the-
Eidsvold Goldfield,” by William H. Rands, Assistant Government
Geologist. Brisbane : By authority, 1887.)
In the Report above quoted, Mr. Rands gives detailed descriptions-
of the several reefs, and mentions the occurrence of tin ore (cassri
ferrite) in one of them, associated with tourmaline, and of stibnite
(sulphide of antimony) in another.
Up to the end of 1887, only 27 tons of stone had been crushed,,
for a yield of 84oz. of gold.
Brovinia Goldfield
The existence of gold in this locality has been known for many
years. It was, however, only in 1886 that the reward was claimed
for the discovery of payable gold. There are five reefs in the May
Queen Claim. 10 tons of stone sent to Gympie gave a return of l©z.
14dwts. of gold per ton. Machinery is about to be erected on the
field.
Gympie Goldfield.
Gympie stands next to Charters Towers in importance among
the goldfields of the Colony, although the auriferous rocks occupy a
very limited area. The Country-rock is a series of strata which dip
at an average angle of 22deg. a little to the North of East. The
uppermost bed of the auriferous veins is a limestone. The Grey
shales and Sandstones above the limestone appear to be entirely out
of the goldfield.
The auriferous rocks beneath the limestone consist of grey
shales, black pyritous shales, greywackes, sandstones, grits, and
conglomerates. The Sandstones are often slightly calcareous. The
conglomerates are masses of pebbles or boulders of all sizes up to a
foot in diameter. The boulders and pebbles are generally well
rounded, but in many cases the angular condition of the fragments in


'the grits and conglomerates suggests a volcanic origin. It is
remarkable that the strata of the field present alternations of
sedimentary rocks which have undergone no alteration with others
which have become indurated and semi-crystalline.
The richest deposits of gold occur in the reefs where the latter
intersect the pyritous black shale or slate country. Gympie, in this
respect, presents the clearest case known to me of the segregation of
the gold from the adjacent rock. The matrix of the gold is generally
-quartz, but not unfrequently calcite.
The limestone, shales, and calcareous sandstones have yielded an
■abundant fossil fauna, sufficient to prove that the Gympie Goldfield
is a locally-metamorphosed portion of the Bowen River Beds (Car-
bonifero-Permian), the equivalent of the Newcastle (New South
Wales) Coalfield.
The Greenstone of Gympie has long formed a subject of con-
troversy. There are some intrusive dark-green crystalline rocks on
the field which were probably once dolerites or diorites, but, even in
mici’oscopic sections, these rocks are much altered and “ masked” by
viridite. A good deal of the “ Greenstone ” is probably derived from
the metamorphism of sedimentary or ashy rocks, while a considerable
amount of confusion has been caused by the habit of calling any
greenish rock a “greenstone.”
The majority of the principal reefs, such as the Great Eastern,
Glanmire, Columbia, Wiltshire, Smithfield, Willmott, Phoenix,
March, Golden Crown, Maori, Alma, Lady Mary, Caledonia, Hilton,
California, Nil Desperandum, Louisa, Pei-severance, Excelsior, and
Alliance, have a general North or North-North-West bearing, and
underlie to the east, with an inclination which is nearly at right-
angles to the dip of the strata. The Helen Hawkins has a North and
South bearing, but underlies to the West at 65deg. The most
important cross-reefs are the Monkland, which bears North-West and
underlies South-West, and the Inglewood, which bears North-North-
West and underlies North-North-East.
The field is disturbed by several important faults. One of these,
in the line of Phoenix Street, is calculated (from the displacement of
the outcrop of the limestone bed) to have a downthrow of 528 ft. to
the North. None of the reefs on the North side of the fault are
recognised with certainty on the South side.
The field has been examined in great detail by Mr. W. H. Rands,
whose report, now nearly ready, will probably form the most
important memoir yet published on Queensland Geology.
In the early days a good deal of alluvial gold was obtained, but
this is now a thing of the past. The total amount of gold produced
is estimated at 1,323,4120 z. This includes the output of Kilkivan
and Black Snake, which, however, is too small to interfere seriously
with the total.

Kilkivan and Black Snake
“Most of the work at Kilkivan has been the driving of
tunnels in a sheet of White porphyry, which occurs in the face of a
range running North and South. The porphyry varies greatly in
thickness. There are no defined reefs at all in the porphyry, but
only minute veins of quartz with oxides of Iron and Manganese.
Where the manganese dioxide occurs the veins are the richest in gold.
In some parts of the porphyry these veins are very numerous, and
the veins are very patchy. Where these patches occur, however, the
whole of the mass will pay to crush. No large quantity of stone can
he obtained. Two men who have been working in the Long Tunnel
P.C., which is considered the best claim in the porphyry, after six
months’ work, have just had a crushing of tons for 240 z. of
smelted gold. The cost of carting and crushing alone was £3 per ton.
“ The country around Kilkivan consists entirely of metamorphic
rocks, such as serpentine, hornblendic and micaceous schists. All the
reefs found in this district occur in these rocks. From the Rise and
Shine Reef very good specimens of gold in the quartz were obtained
in the upper part. Lower down the stone changes to a Mundic con-
sisting greatly of zinc blende with some iron pyrites and a little
galena.
“ The country between Kilkivan and the Black Snake, and Mount
Coora is entirely of schists —chiefly hornblendic—and mica-schists,,
which have a steep inclination to the North West.
“ Th e gold-bearing reefs of the Black Snake district occur
in a micaceous porphyrite. This rock consists of a felsitic base with.


porphyritic crystals of oligoclase felspar and mica, some pyrites, and
here and there viridite and chlorite from the decomposition of some
of the original constituents of the rock. This rock occupies a small
area of about 3 square miles. The reefs generally have a North-West
hearing and are perpendicular, or have a slight underlie to the East
or South- East. The ores from these reefs are complex; in the
Mariner’s Reef, for instance, at a small depth the ore consists of iron,
copper, arsenical pyrites, silver-lead ore (galena), and a small amount
of sulphide of antimony. The gold in this ore was equal to a little
over loz per ton. The silver to about 250 z. per ton. Copper, as
carbonate or sulphide, is met with, sometimes sufficiently rich to
smelt. 50 tons from the Rose, Shamrock and Thistle Reef were sold
to the Mount Coora Copper Mining Company.
“ Outside this area of porphyrite, Northward towards Mount
Coora, are altered rocks consisting of serpentine and of an altered
volcanic rock, probably an altered dolerite. The whole area was
most probably of the same volcanic rocks, parts of which have under-
gone a greater change. It is in these rocks that the Mount Coora
and Mount Clara Copper lodes occur.
“ The Black Snake is now almost entirely deserted. This state
of affairs is due, in my opinion, not so much to the poverty of the
reefs, as to the fact that the land, having become private property, is
closed to general enterprise. This held has, moreover, got a bad
name owing to the investment of a large amount of capital in erect-
ing furnaces and extravagant crushing plants instead of in the mines
themselves.” (W. H. Rands in Report of the Department of Mines
for 1885.)
In “ Report on the Geology and Mineral Resources of the Dis-
tricts of Kilkivan and the Black Snake ” (Brisbane : By authority,
1886), Mr. Rands describes the Rise and Shine (which has given
2,7600 z. of gold from 1,336 tons of stone), Morning Star, Welcome,
Perseverance, and New Year’s Reefs at Kilkivan, and the Rose,
Shamrock and Thistle, Tableland, New Zealand, Black Snake, Home-
ward Bound, Mariner’s and Victoria Reefs at Black Snake. Of the
Black Snake Reefs, Mr. Rands observes : “ Judging from specimens
of ore I saw, and also from assays of samples, there can be no doubt
as to the high value of the ores in this district, and as the reefs
generally are of a good average width, some of them, at any rate,
should pay well to work. The ore would require special and expen-
sive treatment to extract the gold and other metals of commercial
value, and it would probably be found advisable to merely con-
centrate them on the field and send them elsewhere for treatment.”
Important copper lodes occur in the Black Snake district at
Mount Coora and Mount Clara and other localities, but are not now
worked.
Cobalt and Nickel ores are also found in the district. The
deposits will be described in the paragraph relating to the Kilkivan
Mercury Mines.

Jimna and Gooroomjam Goldfields.
Jimna goldfield has been worked off and on for more than
Tenningering, Boolboonda, Molangul, and
Normanby Goldfields.
The Reid’s Creek Reefs are about five miles South-South-West of
Mount Perry, on Branch Creek, a tributary of Reid’s Creek. These
reefs, Mr. Israel Bennett informs me, have turned out “ during the
last twelve years ” (though I gather from the Annual Reports of the
Department that they have only been worked since 1881) 400 tons of
stone, valued at £l5 per ton, £6,000, and 1,2000 z. of gold, valued at
£3 10s. per ounce, £4,200; total, £10,200. At a depth the lodes
yield a mundic consisting chiefly of arsenical iron pyrites, but con-
taining also iron pyrites and zinc-blende, with here and there blocks
of galena.
None of the other smaller fields in the Burnett District have
ever attained to much importance, and it would be impossible to
estimate their yield with any degree of accuracy. They are grouped
together in the Official Returns, sometimes under one heading and
sometimes under another. The little field which produced all the
gold in one year’s Return was perhaps abandoned the next, so that
the goldmines of the whole Burnett district have to be regarded as
one group. Probably even thus the Returns are unsatisfactory. For
instance, Mr. Rands in his “ Report,” published in 1885, gives the
output for 1884 of the Reid’s Creek mines alone as 688ozs. of gold
from 830 tons of stone, while the Output of the whole district for the
year is given in the Annual Report of the Department of Mines as
4310z5. from 603 tons.
twenty years, but has not been highly productive, except at first, for


•alluvial gold. Its output, when reported, has generally been massed
an the Annual Returns with those of “ Other Small Fields.”
“ The rocks at the Jimna Diggings are principally granite, slate,
and sandstone, with comparatively little quartz. The alluvial drift of
the only two creeks that have been worked —“ Jimna ” and “ Sandy
Creeks ” —rests sometimes on decomposed granite, and sometimes on
Sandstone or slate. The workings have extended four or five miles
down .each of these Creeks.” Mortimore’s reef, on Jimna Creek, con-
tains fine gold. It is interesting as having been the first auriferous
reef observed in the colonies traversing granite country.
Gooroomjam is situated on that portion of the Bunya
Range which divides the sources of the Brisbane River from those of
the Burnett. The diggings are confined to two gullies that descend
from either side of the range. Monarrumbi Creek is worked for
about half a mile in length, and the “ Dry Gully ” for even a less dis-
tance than this. The area mined upon consists entirely of green-
stone, with the exception of the lower portion of the workings on
Monarrumbi Creek, where massive hornblendic slates crop out at the
foot of the range on the North side of the Creek, and granite on the
point of the spur constituting the South bank. But I believe that
the little quantity of gold found here has travelled from the tract of
greenstone above, and that the whole of the gold has been derived
from this latter rock. The only instances of vein quartz, locally
termed “reefs,” were in the “ Wild Horse ” and “White’s ” Claims,
both being in greenstone. (Aplin, “ Report of the Government
Geologist, Southern Division.” Brisbane: By authority, 1869.)
Warwick Goldfields.
Lucky Valley, Talgai, Canal Creek, and Pikedale.
These small goldfields have never attained to any importance.
Mr. D’Oyly H. Aplin, in his “ Report on the auriferous country of
the Upper Condamine ” (Brisbane : By authority, 1869), says: —
■“ Talgai, Greek, and Canal Creek, are comprised within one
continuous area oi similar formation (probably Lower Silurian),*
but between this and its eastern development at Lucky Valley there
intervenes, along the immediate valley of the Condamine, a strip of
about 25 miles of country occupied by Sandstones, Gravels, and con-
glomerates, belonging to the Coal Measure Series.”
Lucky Valley is entirely an alluvial “ diggings.”
Copper lodes, as well as auriferous raundic-reefs, occur at Pike-
•uffer Gully (Lucky Valley) there are found
“ small, bright foliated metallic plates and scales of Tellurium, in
which gold may be seen imbedded.” (Aplin.)

SILVER
FIELDS
Mount Albion Silver Field.
West of the stanniferous porphyritic and granitic country of
Herberton and Watsonville a band of stratified rocks sti’etches North-
Westward from the head of the Dry River. They consist, for the
most part, of shales and siliceous grits, the latter occasionally altered
so as to be almost quartzites. Their general strike appears to be
from North and South to North-North-West and Soutb-South-East, but
at Mount Albion itself, which is the most highly mineralised portion
of the district, the rocks (among which siliceous grits predominate) l
have been minced up by innumerable faults into small segments, in
each of which the strata have their own peculiar dip. In the Mount
Albion Mine some sandstones are marked with reed-like plant im-
pressions, but nothing has yet been discovered sufficiently distinct to 1
afford any evidence as to the age of the deposits.
In the principal mines on Mount Albion—viz., the Albion, Lady
Jane, and Barossa —-immense deposits of ore occur in a very irregular
manner. It appears that the faults are even more numerous than
the evidence observable at the surface would indicate, and that the
ore has filled up fissures formed by faults which intersect one another
in every direction, so that there are no definite walls which can be
followed for any distance. The ores are earthy and ferruginous, with
argentiferous lead oxides and carbonates, and probably a good deal of
silver chloride in fine particles accounts Jor their occasional extraordi-
nary richness (six or seven hundred ounces of silver to the ton). Large
Plugs of Horn Silver are met with from tine to time in the workings.
In the Albion some were obtained at the surface and at 19 feet. In
the Lady Jane some were obtained at tlie 130 and 180 feet levels.
The mines have not yet reached the wa;er level, which is probably


low, the Mount being well drained by the faults wliich intersect it in
every direction. Iron and lead oxides and carbonates, therefore,
predominate, sulphide and sulphate ores forming, except in the
Barossa (where the Galena is associated with Zinc Blende), only a
small proportion of the ore.
In marked contrast to the deposits of ore on Mount Albion are
those which occur about a mile and a half to the South-East. A
large lode, the Silverhill, which might be taken as a typical example
of what is meant by a true fissure lode, runs North and South through
slate country, underlying at 45 degrees to the West. It is distinctly
traceable, across two hills and two gullies, for a distance of 1,500 feet,
by occasional exposures of galena. In the workings the galena ore
runs from 9 inches to 3 feet in thickness, is occasionally associated
with Anglesite, Zinc blende and Pyrites, and is accompanied by a
brecciform gangue of broken country-rock. The ore, although more
than payable, is not nearly so rich in silver as that of Mount Albion.
The mines at the Orient Camp, six miles North-East of Mount Albion,
produce a similar class of ore to that of Silverhill.
Smelting Works have been erected on Cummings’ Creek, Mount
Albion, by Messrs. John Moffatt & Co., and the ores have been very
successfully treated. The earthy ores of Mount Albion are mixed in
due proportions with the galena ores of the Orient and Silverhill, and
with ironstone and limestone from the Dry River. The bullion is
cast into ingots of lead containing generally about 600' ounces of
silver to the ton and exported in this form.
Some confusion has arisen, owing to the Mineral Lands Com-
missioner having given in 1885 the amount of ore raised , while in 1886
only the amount smelted is given. Probably the amount smelted in
the latter year included some of that raised in the former,-so that the
Returns are defective for statistical purposes. The following Notes
embody all the information obtainableln 1885, 2,028 tons of ore
were raised , containing 218,4500 z. of silver. Estimating the value of
the ore on a basis of 3s. 6d. per oz. of silver, the value would be
£38,229. In 1886, tons of ore smelted, yielded 223 tons of
Bullion, estimated to contain 88,2240 z. of silver; at 3s. 6d. per oz. of
silver, the value would be £15,439. How much was raised during
the year is not stated. In 1887, 1,041 tons of ore were raised, at a
value estimated at £54,572. The amount of Bullion for the year is
not given, at least in the Abstract of the Annual Report accessible to
me up to date. For the quarter ending 31st March, 1888, a News--
paper Report gives the Mineiul Lands Commissioner’s Return of 1,262'
tons of ore smelted, for a yield of 250 tons Bullion, estimated to con-
tain 54,2500 z. of silver; at 3s. 6d. per oz. this would be worth
£9,494. These total values, for obvious reasons, cannot be added
together.

oz. of silver. Preparations for the erection of a Water-jacket smelter

Dry River Silver Field.
This field lies in the belt of mineralised stratified rocks which
extends South-Eastward from Mount Albion. The slates and grey-
wackes which form the mass of the strata strike mainly North and
South. The principal lodes—the Try-no-More, Dunn’s, Silver Streak,
Target, Silver Valley, White Star, and Rainbow trend on an
•average from North-West to South-East, and underlie to the South-
West. They have, as a rule, caps of ferruginous gossan showing lead
oxide, galena, sulphate of lead, and Carbonate of copper. In the
Try-no-More, the ore at a greater depth is somewhat complex, being
composed of copper pyrites, grey iron pyrites, galena, and zinc-
blende. The other mines, however, yield chiefly argentiferous
galena, with occasional zinc-blende. A smelting Company com-
menced operations in 1883, and suspended operations in 1886.
There is no doubt that several of the mines are distinctly payable.
The failure of the field is attributed locally to the policy of the
Smelting Company, which was said to have been to force outside
holders to sell their mines. The result is said to have been that
ultimately these mines ceased to produce enough to keep the Works
employed. A decidedly good opening is offered by this field for a
smelting work conducted on a more rational principle.


At present operations on the field are limited to the raising of
limestone and ironstone, used as fluxes at the Mount Albion Works.
The following table gives extracts from the Mineral Lands-
Commissioner’s Reports :

Ravenswood Silver Field.
A belt of argentiferous rocks extends for about six miles North-
Westward from the richest part of the Ravenswood Goldfield. Al-
though the goldfield and the silveidield are both in granite country, a
tolerably distinct line may be drawn between the grey syeniticr
granite of the goldfield and the coarse-grained red granite of the
silverfield. The latter is a mixture of roundish blebs of quartz,
flesh-coloured or pinkish orthoclase crystals, and hexagonal mica.
The principal lode, known as King’s, or the “ One-mile,” runs North
28degs. West, and underlies at 35degs. to East 28degs. North. It is a
very rich lode, and frequently consists of two parallel veins. The
surface yielded carbonates of lead, giving as much as 300 oz. of
silver to the ton. The lower levels have given a steady yield of
galena ores, with, as a rule, 2oz. of silver per ton to the unit of
lead. The galena is in places a good deal mixed with pyrites and
zinc-blende. In a shaft in Lease 109 the lode has been cut at a
vertical depth of 650 feet. The shaft bottomed on an antimony and
copper ore, somewhat resembling Tetrahedrite in its composition, but
containing from 500 oz. to 5,0000 z. of silver to the ton. Pumping
and winding and dressing machinery are being erected to work this
rich deposit.
The Mount Right lodes, at the North-Western end of *‘the-
argentiferous belt, have not yet been worked on a large scale,
although the Warden reported that in 1883 a single miner raised 20
tons of galena ore, worth £4OO. In 1884 the same “ hatter ” raised
26 tons, worth £702. Some thin lodes of antimony ore occur among
the silver-lead mines of Mount Right.
In the following table, the great bulk of the ore has been raised
from King’s Mine. The other mines are specified where the informa-
tion is given in the Annual Reports of the Department of Mines.

The argentiferous lead lodes of the Argentine field occur partly
in granite country and partly among highly-inclined micaceous clay-
slates, mica schists, and gneisses. Regarding the age of the sedi-
mentary rocks above referred to, no distinct evidence has yet been
brought to light. A thick series of white sandstones, pebbly grits,
and conglomerates, probably identical with the lower portion of the
“ Star Beds” (Upper Carboniferous), lies unconformably on the slates,
&c., or rests on the Granite.
The field has been in existence since 1881. The lodes, especially
those in the mica schist country, offer every indication of richness
and permanence; fuel and limestone and ironstone for fluxing are
abundant and conveniently situated. In spite of all these advantages,
prosperity has hardly yet dawned on the field. The majority of "the
lodes were originally _ secured as freeholds under the old ' Mineral
Lands Act, the workings being for a time of a very perfunctory
nature and having for their object the bare fulfilment of the
“ improvement conditions,” or the raising of sufficient “specimens” to
induce:©utsiders to purchase the mines. Some of the mines, worked
on a pool man s scale, have obviously failed through the
mechanical difficulty of separating earthy low - grade oxide and
carbonate ores from the almost equally heavy ferruginous gangue-
stuffi without dressing machinery. The failure of the Smelting
Works, which were erected prematurely, before sufficient quantities of
ore were ready for them, was a severe blow, destroying as it did
confidence in the value of the mines, and bringing about their almost
complete desertion. The Hero and Northbrook Mines have, however,
sheen steadily worked at a profit for some years, the ores being shipped


from Townsville. A powerful Company has now secured the former,
and it is reported that their operations have been highly successful.
The surface ores, which have alone been raised hitherto, consist
for the most part of oxides, carbonates, sulphates, and sulphides of
lead. The silver-contents of samples which I have assayed average
generally about per ton to the unit of lead, but occasionally
reach soz. of silver to the unit. In other words, a ton of galena ore con-
taining 60 per cent, of lead might contain from 750 z. to 300 oz. of silver.
There can be no doubt that this field will yet take a high place
; among the silver-producing localities of Australia.
As the Argentine field was only occasionally visited by the
Warden from Ravenswood, the Returns of the output as given in
the Annual Reports of the Depai-tment of Mines only give occasional
references to quantities of ore exported. The following are all the

Another mode of estimating the value of the Argentine Ores is ;
furnished by the following Return, kindly supplied by Mr. Joseph
Hughes, Sub-Collector of Customs, Townsville. If from the totals
of 7,064 tons 16cwt. 3qrs., shipped at Townsville from 1883 to 1887
inclusive, and valued at £159,893, we deduct 4,251 tons from Ravens-
wood, valued at £104,203, and 667 tons from the Sellheim, valued at
£13,115,* in all 4,928 tons, valued at £117,318, we obtain (provided
the Ravenswood and Sellheim Returns are complete) 2,136 tons 16cwt.
3qrs., valued at £42,575, as the product of the Argentine field. But
that this is an over-estimate is as certain as that the results obtained
by the other methods are under-estimates.

Field
This field furnishes good argentiferous galena ores, and, although
it has been worked under considerable difficulties, owing to its-
distance from the coast and the absence of dressing or smelting
works, has, with energy and perseverance, been able to hold its-
ground. It is probable that smelting works will shortly be erected.
The principal lodes are the Pyramid, Bonnie Dundee, Birthday Gift,
General Gordon, Sunrise, and Argentine. Carbonate of Bismuth has
recently been found in one of the silver lodes. The mines appear to
be situated in “ a series of blue and grey slates and shales, on the
upturned edges of which rest the slightly-inclined grits and sand-
stones of the Upper Devonian Lepidodendron beds.” Fossils from the
slates and shales were referred by Professor McCoy to the Upper
Silurian period. (“ General Report upon the Northern Division,” by

TIN FIELDS.
Pascoe Tinfield.
Stream tin has recently been discovered near the mouth of the
Pascoe, but the value of the discovery has yet to be tested. The tin
ore probably came from the granite country of the Carron and
Janet Ranges.
Cannibal Creek Tinfield.
Up to 31st December, 1884, 2,373 tons of Tin Ore, valued at
£102,300 10s., had been exported from the Palmer Goldfield, chiefly
from alluvial workings on Granite and Cannibal Creeks. Although
this stream tin was collected from slate and greywacke country, and
in the neighbourhood of the Cannibal Creek lodes, it probably came,
for the most part, from the granite range to the East. This range,
which is a stronghold of the aborigines, has never been sufficiently
prospected for lodes. The lodes on Cannibal Creek are large quartz
reefs, running East 15deg. South, and containing some tin ore. The
formation of a Company to work these lodes resulted disastrously, as
expensive machinery was erected before the mines were proved to be
payable.

Herberton Tin
Field.
Annan and Bloomfield Tinfields.
These tinfields have only recently been opened, and as yet, or till
very recently, the only ore exported has been stream tin, which is
found in narrow gullies among tropical jungle. The country-rock is
granite. Fortunately water is abundant, and washing presents no
difficulties. The narrowness of the gullies hitherto worked has made
it not worth while to apply hydraulic power to the washing, but this
will probably be done in future in the wider and deeper drifts of the
lower reaches of the Annan, Trevethan Creek, and the Bloomfield.
In the Mount Amos district, several lodes or reefs of quartz, con-
taining tourmaline, hornblende, - wolfram, and tin, have been opened.
Very extensive deposits of lode tin have lately been discovered at the
Lion’s Den and Mount Leswell, and dressing machinery is about to
be erected. The following table shows the export of stream tin from
1885 to the end of March, 1888: —
Yield of Annan and Bloomfield Tinfields,
This field, which is by far the most important source of lode
tin in Australia, is still in its infancy, having only been discovered in
1879.
The “ Country rock ” of this field is divisible into three classes:
(1) a perfectly normal Granite; (2) a Porphyry of Quartz and
felspar (quartz predominating), with mica as an occasional or acci-
dental and not essential constituent; and (3) highly inclined grey-
wackes, quartzites, and shales. The rocks of the first class, which
extend Northward from Watsonville, appear to be nearly barren of
tin ore. Those of the second were for a time regarded as the only
seat of the tin deposits ; but it is now questionable whether those of
the third class do not excel them in this respect.
The Porphyry Rocks are intersected in every direction by large
“ elvan ” dykes (compact, highly-silicated yellowish or greenish
felspar base with blebs of quartz). These elvans contain a good deal
of arsenical pyrites, but —except in the case of the “ Three Star ”
Mine —have not yet proved to be tin-bearing to any great extent.
Dykes of quartzose chlorite and quartzose serpentine—probably
originally intruded among the porphyry as quartz-diorites, or as
rocks more or less of basaltic type, and subsequently metamorphosed-
form the chief matrix of the tin ore in the porphyry country. The


ore occurs in floors, veins, or pipes among the joint-planes of the
dykes. The ore (binoxide of tin) is rarely crystalline; hut occurs
either in amorphous masses, almost chemically pure, or intermixed
with the dyke rock. Sometimes, as in the Bradlaugh Mine, the ore
is so finely disseminated through the dark chlorite matrix as not to
be distinguishable by the naked eye. These “ chlorite ores ” gene-
rally weather of the colour characteristic of iron peroxide, and in
such cases the tin ore is rather more obvious. Fluor spar and Wolfram
are associated with the ore, but tourmaline is of rather rare
occurrence.
It seems most probable that the tin first came up in solution after
the consolidation of the dykes and has been deposited along their
walls and among the fissures and joint-planes which traversed them.
A re-solution of the tin ore probably took place simultaneously with
the metamorphism of the dykes; and as the metamorphosed dykes
had probably a new joint system developed in them, a further con-
centration of the ore may have taken place.
Considerable difficulties were at first experienced in following
down the apparently capricious ore deposits, and the miners were
haunted by doubts as to their continuance at greater depths. It has
always seemed to me that their intimate connection with dykes was
a sufficient guarantee of their great vertical range. The Great
Northern, which has maintained from the beginning its position as
the leading: mine in the Porphyry country, is now turning out ore
from the 300 ft. level.
In the Sedimentary Country Rock the Group of mines now united
in the North Australian Lease, near Watsonville, was the first to
attract attention. In these mines, especially in the North Australian
and Ironclad, the lodes, although themselves sometimes poor for a
distance, sent off huge “ carbonas ” of tin and copper ore along the
bedding-planes of the shales and greywackes. In 1883-6, this group
of mines yielded 1,287£ tons of dressed tin ore, valued at £64,382.
More recently very important lodes of tin ore have been opened
up in the sedimentary rocks at Irvinebank (Great Southern, &c.), in
Glen Linedale, and at Denny & Dogherty’s Camp. In the Irvinebank
lodes the ore is generally of the “ chlorite ” type, and in the Great
Southern mine it is associated with arsenical pyrites, bismuth,
stibnite, &c. In the Gordon, in Glen Linedale, the ore impregnates
a country-rock of hard, fine-grained, siliceous, and talcose sandstone.
At Denny & Dogherty’s (’amp very fine crystals of tin ore are dissemi-
nated through a chloritic matrix in lodes which coincide with the
bedding of the country-rock (pebbly grits).
There is little doubt that the stanniferous sedimentary rocks of
this district are part of the same mineralised belt which has produced
the lead and silver ores of Mount Albion and the Dry River.

Mount Spurgeon Tinfield
This field has only been discovered in 1886. Lodes are known to
exist, bnt the only export as yet has been stream tin ore. The Report
of the Department of Mines, for 1887, gives the amount of ore raised
as GO tons, valued at £4,800. According to the Agent for the
A.U.S.N. Co., at Port Douglas, the amount of Mount Spurgeon tin
ore exported from the opening of the field up to 28th April last was
200 tons. At £BO per ton, which is the value put on the ore raised
in 1886, the 200 tons would be worth £16,000.
Kangaroo Hills and Running Creek Tinfields.
Stream tin ore has been worked on Running Creek as far back as
1875, but no records of the output are now obtainable. The country-

The discovery of stream and lode tin ore in Kangaroo Hills
resulted from the impetus given to prospecting by the opening of
Herberton. The country-rock is porphyry, very like that of Herberton.
Although the lodes promise well, a difficulty has hitherto been
experienced in the introduction of capital to work them, and the sole
export as yet (with trifling exceptions) has been stream tin ore. In
1883, Mr. Warden Pears reported: “In the Prospectors’Selections
the lode has been opened in several places, and shows splendid tin,
and a very regular formation for so shallow a depth. Bismuth has
been found, and there are also copper lodes.”

Stanthorpe Tinfield
The Stanthorpe Stream Tin Mines, on the borders of New South
Wales, lie on the surface of a granitic tableland, at an average eleva-
tion of a little less than 3,000 feet above the sea. The heads of the
streams are shallow and swampy. Where the streams attain any
magnitude they find it easy to wander among the soft decomposing
surface of the granite country. The Severn, therefore, and its
tributaries, such as Quartpot Creek, have exceedingly tortuous
courses and deep alluvial deposits.
By far the greater part of the stream tin is in fine grains of the
size of a pin’s head and under, and almost always reveals under the
lens some trace of an original crystalline condition. It contains a
large proportion of the “ Ruby ” and “ Amber ” varieties. Together
with quartz granules it forms, as a general rule, the matrix of a
coarse imperfectly cemented conglomerate or gravel of quartz and
granite pebbles. The pebbles are often rather squared than rounded.
They are not of a nature to retain striations well, but the shape of
some of them leads me strongly to suspect that their attrition might,
in the first instance, have been due to glacial action. The crystalline
fragments of felspar, which have frequently been carried into the
wash along with the quartz and tinstone, have in most cases decom-
posed into a stiff kaolin, which sometimes helps to keep the wash
together.


The tin wash is for the most part confined to the layer of gravel
or unconsolidated conglomerate lying directly on the bed-rock. This
gravel is generally overlaid by a varying thickness (up to 25 feet or
more) of gritty sand, which is occasionally interrupted by thin
layers of gravel (with streaks of tinstone) or of clay.
After an examination of the alluvial workings (in 1882), I con-
cluded that the tinstone, in its original matrix, must have been in
the form of crystals, rarely of large size. The ore was probably
concentrated by the weathering of its matrix —whether reef, lode, or
dyke —and of the encasing granite country during a long period of
gentle subaerial denudation, when the rains were never sufficiently
heavy to remove the tin, or even the larger quartz stones, from the
hillsides where they were left by the decay of their matrix. To this
there apparently succeeded a limited period of heavy rainfall, or
possibly of snow whose melting produced a rush of water sufficiently
strong to “ sluice ” the general surface of the hill country, and to
deposit its heavier materials (including the tinstone) in the upper
reaches of the Severn and its tributaries, while carrying off its finer
particles to the plains of the South-West. To the now current period
belong the accumulation under temperate conditions of the existing
surface wash on the hillsides (moderately rich in Tin ore), and the
deposition of the sand (almost destitute of tin ore) which overlies
the tin-wash in the streams.
Two distinct types of tin-bearing rocks are met with in the
district —quartz reefs and igneous dykes.
The reefs are best developed in the Ridges on the left bank of
Quartpot Creek, nearly opposite Sommerville’s homestead. Here are
the outcrops of at least seven reefs or veins, four of which bear North-
North-East, one North-East, and one East and West.
They are of highly crystalline quartz (sometimes smokey), and all
contain much wolfram and moderate-sized crystals of tin ore, the latter
almost always confined to faces and joints. Such reefs are apparently
the sources of some of the coarser stream tin which is locally met
with.
The dykes are composed of granular quartz, fine scaly lithia-
mica, and small crystals of tinstone, and form a rock much resembling
the stanniferous Greisen of Saxony. They seem to have been erupted
in a molten condition (bringing up the tin oxide with them), among
fissures in the granite. The tinstone bears, in some samples I have
seen, a proportion of 5 or 10 per cent, to the general mass of the rock.
Dykes of this character are seen at various points in the range on the
boundary of the colony, between the heads of Kettle Swamp and
Sugarloaf Creeks. They run at varying angles from North-North-
East to East-North-East, coinciding in their direction with a system
of jointing, which characterises the granite. The tin ore crystals of
the dykes are precisely what, with a little attrition, would form the
main mass of the stream tin of the heads of the Severn.


In spite of the riches of the alluvial deposits of Stanthorpe, no
payable tin lode has yet been found on the Queensland side of the
border.
The Stanthorpe Tinfield has never been geologically mapped in
detail, but the exhaustive Report of Mr. T. W. Edgeworth David on
the Vegetable Creek Tin Mining District of Yew South Wales, throws
considerable light on the subject. Mr. David classifies the stanniferous
deposits as follows :

COPPER FIELDS.
Cloncurry Copperfleld.
(See Cloncurry Gold and Copper Fields.)
Peak Downs Copperfleld.
“ This lode was discovered in 1862. It can be traced for over
1| miles, running in an East and West direction. It has an underlie
varying from 40 to 70 degrees to the South. The country consists
of foliated and contorted micaceous and hornblendic schists, dipping
South-East. The outcrop is a gossan, consisting chiefly of red and
brown hasmatite, with a little oxide of manganese, and carbonates
of copper. The ores were oxides and carbonates of copper to a depth
of about 75ft. vertical from the surface, a mixture of oxidised ores
and sulphurets to a depth of 120 ft., and below that depth they were
ordinary sulphurets of Copper,
“ The gossan at the surface was auriferous; assays of it give
from 4dwt. to loz. 15dwt. of gold per ton, and also up to as high as
soz. of silver per ton.
“ The deepest workings were 66 fathoms. Most of the lode was
taken out to a depth of 40 fathoms for a distance of half-a-mile.
From 1862 to 1878, when the original company was wound up, about
100,000 tons of Ore, averaging 17 per cent, of Copper, were smelted
at the company’s own works. That would give 17,000 tons of Copper,
the value of which was over £1,250,000. Copper lodes, known as
the “Western Peak Downs Copper Lodes,” exist about 7 miles West
of Copperfleld. Rich sulphurets of copper were obtained from these.”
(Rands’s “ Geology, &c., of Clermont.”)
Mount Perry Copper Mine
“ Seven shafts have been put down on the lode to various depths;
the main or engine shaft is now between 800 and 900 ft. deep. The
course of the lode is North, 37 degrees East, and where it is at present
being worked (to the South-West of the main shaft) it heads to the
South-East about 8 degrees ” [from the vertical]. “ Near the surface
the ore consisted of green Carbonate and Azurite, and at 30ft. deep of


rich red (Cuprite) and grey oxides of copper, and below this depth of
yellow ore and copper pyrites. The pyrites is contained in a veinstone
of quartz and calcite, each of which predominates in turns. To the
North of the main shaft much iron pyrites has been met with mixed
with the copper ore. At the present depth [lßßs] the lode is about
4ft. in width. The width of ore is about lOin. on an average.” . . .
“ There are numerous cross-courses, which, although they do not
displace the lode, yet often affect the ore in the lode, either by break-
ing it up into strings, or by displacing it from one side of the lode to
the other. At these points of intersection the lode is usually enriched.
A dyke of orthoclase porphyry runs parallel with the lode, and is dis-
placed too by the cross-courses. Two dykes of dolerite also cross the
lode in a North-Westerly direction.” The country-rock is a syentic
granite which Mr. Rands regards as Metamorphic. The granite in
places has carbonate of copper diseminated through its mass. At the
“Queensland” Claim, the granite is worked as a low-percentage ore
(10 per cent, of copper) to assist in the smelting of the Pyrites at the
Mount Perry Mine.
The Canterbury and Normanby lodes adjoin and run parallel
with the Mount Perry lode. Nine miles to the West is the Potosi
lode. It contains galena, with copper and iron-pyrites and a little zinc-
blende, in a gangue of quartz and barytes. The Mungai lodes are 3
miles further West, in a country-rock of actinolite schist. From these
lodes carbonates of copper are raised for smelting with the Mount
Perry ores.
The Wolca lodes are 6 miles North of Mount Perry. Some of
these contain gold, one (the Allendale) as much as 15dwts. to the ton,
as well as copper ore. There is another group of lodes in the paddock
■of Wombah Station.
The Boolboonda Mines lie to the Bast of the granite country, in a
belt of metamorphic rocks, consisting of gneisses, schists, quartzites, &c.
The “ Boolboonda,” “ Cambria,” and “ New Moonta ” lodes, contain
gold as well as copper —apparently in several cases in proportions,
which would be payable under favourable conditions. (For further
details see Mr. Rands’s “ Report on the Goldfields of Raglan, &c., and
the Mineral Deposits in the Burnett District.” Brisbane: By

Kilkivan Mercury Mines and Mount Coora
Cobalt Mine.
Mr. Rands reported as follows on the Queensland and Wolf
Cinnabar Lodes in the end of 1886 :
“ The matrix of the lodes consists of quartz and calcite. Both
lodes are looking well, showing Cinnabar all through the stone.


“At the Queensland Lode the shaft is down 42ft. The Lode runs :
North and South. At the bottom of the shaft the lode is divided
into two parts by a “ horse ”of mullock. On the eastern or footwall
is a small vein of quartz which is very rich in ore; next to this is
about Sin. of quartz and calcite, with ore throughout it; while on the
hanging wall is another mass of vein-stuff containing cinnabar. A
little to the North of the shaft the lode takes a sharp bend to the
West. The country is an altered conglomerate or agglomerate,
probably of Volcanic origin, as it is full of angular particles
“ On the Wolf Lode a level has been driven on the bank of the
Gully for 170 ft. on the lode. The country for the first 100 ft. or so
consists of sandstone and shale dipping South-West at this point,
and above them is a volcanic ash, much decomposed, and containing
often large angular pebbles. The lode runs North-East, and averages-
about Ift. in thickness. The matrix contains much more calcite than
that of the Queensland lode.
“ A cross-cut lower down the gully cuts several lodes or veins.
At 19ft., one of Ift. in thickness, of calcite; at 55ft., a lode of Ift,
2in. wide, showing good ore; at 119 ft. is a vein of calcite, which
appears to be dipping towards some leaders at 145 ft., which contains
cinnabar ; and at 200 ft. the Wolf is cut 4ft. 2in. wide, and contains a
very good percentage of Cinnabar.
“ Very rich pieces of nearly pure Cinnabar have been picked up
in a gully on this claim, supposed to have come from a small vein a
short distance from the Wolf Claim.
“So far as the work has at present gone, the prospect for the
future of these mines looks very encouraging.” (Report of the
Department of Mines for 1886.)
An influential Company with a large capital has recently been
formed in London to work these mines. Mr. Clement Tancred
reported to the Directors that the Queensland Lode might be guessed
to “ run for 7ft. wide at something between 2-| and 3 per cent.,
without any dressing.” The “ Sligo ” lode, according to Mr. Tancred,
“ has only been prospected a few feet in depth, not sufficient to get
into settled country. Mr. Hester treated 1001 b. of ore from here,
and obtained 701 b. of Quicksilver.” The “Wolf” ore “will give,
Mr. Hester tells me, an average of fully 6 per cent, all over.” The
“ Hill Lode,” on the “ Wolf,” is said to be “ outcropping for a
distance of I,oooft. on the surface, and is metal-bearing throughout.”
Nothing is recorded of the output of the Cinnabar Mines. In
1877, the Warden reported that “ considerable progress has been
made by the Messrs. Hester at their Cinnabar Works. They have
for some time past kept the machines at Gympie fully supplied with
quicksilver. The quicksilver supplied by Hester Brothers is pre-
ferred by the amalgamators at Gympie to the best article of its kind
imported.”


Several other Cinnabar lodes occur in the district on the heads
of Wide Bay Creek.
A Cobalt Lode occurs in a spur of Mount Coora, consisting
of Serpentine. The lode has been traced over half-a-mile North and
South, and underlies to the West at about 50 degrees. “At its
outcrop the lode consists of 10 or 12ft. of a talcose casing, with
Cobalt ore throughout it next to the footwall; then 22ft. of Cobalt
ore with a brown siliceous matrix (this forms the Chief ore-bearing
portion of the lode) ; above this again, next to the hanging-wall, is a
mineral similar to pimelite, consisting of silicates of magnesia and
alumina with a little silicate of nickel. A tunnel 80ft. in length has
been put in on the back of the lode, and from the end of the tunnel a
cross-cut has been driven through the lode, which passed through
15ft. of the main portion or Cobalt-bearing paid of the lode, and then
about 10ft. of the casing seen at the surface; beyond this another
mass of cobalt ore occurs, the width of which has not yet been
ascertained. The ore is that known as earthy cobalt, consisting of
oxides of cobalt, manganese, iron, and a little copper.
“ Assays have shown the average ore to contain about 6 per cent,
of cobalt, which, according to last Sydney quotations, is worth about
£l3 10s. per ton. By hand-picking the ore it might be brought up
to about 10 per cent., which would be worth £23 per ton. The
extent of the lode, and the large body of ore it contains, makes this
undoubtedly a very valuable and important discovery.” (Mr. Rands,
in Report of the Department of Mines for 1886.)
ANTIMONY MINES.
Northcote Antimony Mines.
The three principal antimony lodes, viz., the “Emily,” “ Craigs,”
and “ Matilda,” occur within the limits of the Hodgkinson Goldfield,
nearly in a line running North-West from the head of Leadingham
Creek to the head of the Hodgkinson. This line coincides with the
strike of the slate and greywacke country-rock, and with the trend of
the lodes. The lodes, however, underlie to the South-West, while
the strata dip to the North-East. They are traceable for considerable
distances on the surface, as quartz reefs stained with antimony oxide,
and on being opened show large shoots of solid sulphide of antimony
(Stibnite). The “ Emily ” was worked for some time for gold; the
recorded crushings, 382 tons 12cwt., having yielded 3150 z. 13dwts.
The Wardens’ Reports mention that in 1877 several tons had
been prepared for shipment, but as the price in Melbourne was only
£l2, nothing further had been done; that in 1881, Messrs. Denny & Co.
were erecting Smelting Works; that in 1882, a quantity of ore had
been raised; that in 1883, Messrs. Edwin Field & Son had erected


iarge Smelting Works; that in 1884, 550 tons of ore had been
smelted, yielding 145 tons of crude antimony, valued at £3,500, and
that the Company had suspended operations; and that in 1885, 70
tons of ore, valued at £3OO, had been raised.
Antimony lodes also occur down the Hodgkinson at Woodville.
Ravenswood Antimony Mines.
(See Rayenswood Silvebfield.)
Neerdie Antimony Mine.
The history of this mine, which, apparently, is rich in Sulphide
of Antimony, has been varied by periods of prosperity and depression
according to the rise or fall in the price of the metal. The total
amount of ore produced from 1873 to 1886 was 930 tons, valued at
£11,769. The statistics, however, give the amount of ore raised
except in the year 1881, when only the amount shipped is given.

COAL
FIELDS
Burrnm Coalfield,
The Burrum Coalfield extends from the mouth of the Kolan
River to Hoosa Head, but it is only at the township of Howard that
collieries have as yet been opened. It occurs in a very flat country,
and prospecting operations are for the most part reduced to mere
“ blind-stabbing ” by the fact that the
surface, the whole of the flat being co\
recent horizontal deposit of sandstone,
covered
seams rarely come to the
unconformably by a more
or loam, from 15 to 50ft.

in thickness. The Coalfield itself appears to be intermediate in age
between the Bowen River Beds (Carbonifero-Permian) and the
Ipswich Beds (Jurassic), from the intermingling of fossil plants com-
mon to both of these formations. The fossil fauna is meagre, and as
several of the species are peculiar to the Burrum Beds, they are of no
value for stratigraphical purposes. The Beds of the Coal Measures
“ extend from the coast some 20 miles inland, to near the heads of the
Burrum and Isis Rivers, where, dipping at a high angle, they are
altered into a series of micaceous schists, and finally rest upon
granite.”

“Mr. Henderson, C.E., Manager of the Maryborough Gas Works,
kindly gave me the following Returns from 20 months’ actual work
with the Coal from the Lapham or Torbanelea Seam :
Gas, 10,200 cubic feet per ton of coal; candle-power, 1473.
Coke, 1,4601b5. per ton of coal; or, 65 per cent.
Tar, 10‘5 gallons per ton of coal.
Ammoniacal liquor, 16 gallons per ton of coal.
“ This seam has proved, in practice, to be superior to either the
Queensland Collieries Company’s seam or the Burrum Seam for gas-
making purposes.
“ The Analyses of coals from the Burrum would show that,
with reference to the volatile hydrocarbons, of which, of course, a
high percentage is necessary for gas-making purposes, they are not
quite as good as Newcastle (N.S.W.) coals. Fourteen samples of the
latter averaged 37'55 per cent, of volatile hydrocarbons, including
water, while the average of seven samples from the Burrum is 3 L*s—
is, taking the hydrocarbons and water together.
“ The ash, which represents so much of worse than useless
matter, is by no means high, the highest result being 8 per cent, and
the lowest 2T per cent.; the average being 4'6 per cent., as against
an average of 497 per cent, in the Newcastle (N.S.W.) Coal. It
should be mentioned that the Burrum samples are from shallow
depths, where the ash is generally higher.
“ The sulphur, averaging o‘4 per cent, in the three samples from
which I determined it, is very low indeed, and the coal will compare
favourably in that respect with coal from any part of the world. The
percentage of this constituent is most important in coals used for
gas-making. Freedom from sulphur, too, is a great advantage in
many metallurgical processes.
“The Cokes from the Queensland Collieries Company’s seam,
the Lapham or Torbanelea Seam, and the Burrum Seam are all good,
coherent, dense cokes, that from the first-named being the densest.
“ The Burrum Coal is not so good a steam coal, on account of its
tenderness. However, I am of opinion that there will be a great
improvement in it in this respect at greater depths.” (“ Report on
the Burrum Coalfield,” by W. H. Rands. Brisbane : By authority,
1886.)
It is only since the opening of the railway from Maryborough
that the Burrum Coalfield has been worked to any extent worth
mentioning. During the last five years, the output has amounted to
124,079 tons, valued at £71,078.

Ipswich Coalfield.
This coalfield is in all probability the equivalent of the Clarence
’Riverbeds of New South Wales (Jurassic.) It contains an abun-
dant fossil flora and a few fresh-water shells. It appears to be a fresh
water formation throughout, although it graduates upwards into the
■marine beds of the “ Rolling Downs ” formation.
The Hon. A. C. Gregory, C.M.G., in his “Report on the Coal
Deposits of the West Moreton and Darling Downs District ” (Brisbane :
By Authority, 1876), gives a detailed account of the coal and other
beds of the field. He remarks (p. 7) that “the general character of
the coals found between Woolloon and Warwick is that of Cannel
Coal. It does not cake in coking ; gives a large per centage of gas,
or oil and paraffine, according to its treatment at a high or low
temperature. Its hardness renders it very suitable for export. It
burns very freely and leaves a soft white ash.
“From the small proportion of fixed carbon, and its not caking, it
•does not produce good coke, but a charred coal which, however, burns
well ; consequently it is not well adapted for blast furnaces, though
well suited for reverberatory furnaces. Asa steam coal it is best
suited for stationary or marine engines, the strong blast of locomotives
being apt to blow it through the tubes. It is a very high-class house-
hold coal.
“In the Ipswich division the coals are bituminous, coking well ;
the proportion of gas being small, and the fixed carbon large, they are
suited for forges and blast furnaces ; are good steam coal when not
broken too small, but are so friable as not to bear carriage well, and
suffer from exposure to wet, so that the harder varieties, though con-
taining most ash, are found in practice to be most economical in con-
sequence of the smaller proportions of waste.
“ In both districts the coal is associated with ironstone bands
and beds of boulders, consisting of concretions of oxide of iron, which
have replaced fragments of fossil wood. The high percentage of ash
in the coal and scarcity of good limestone would, however, be serious
obstacles to the profitable working of the iron at the present low
prices at which it is imported.
“On part of the North and East, and also on the South, the
carboniferous rock rests on Devonian slates, sandstones and lime-
stones, and at a few points on the granite.
“ There are extensive tracts of the carboniferous formation
covered by basalt, which is most extensively developed in the central
part where it forms the summit of the Great Dividing Range, and in
the Southern part there are erupted masses of felstone porphyry
forming high peaks such as Mount Flinders, and at Cunningham’s
Gap on the Main Range, but the coal measures do not appear to be
much disturbed or altered by these outbursts of igneous rocks, while
the manner in which the basalt covers the slate and sandstones
indicates that considerable erosion and denudation had occurred prior
to the basaltic period.


“ The superincumbent basalt is of a much later period than the
coal deposits, as shown by the fossil wood and leaves found in the
stratum of earth between the basalt and the coal shales of the Clifton
Mine, while no fragments of basaltic rock have been found among the
coal strata, and there is evidence that the general features of the
country -were much altered during the interval between the last
deposit of coal and the earlier outbursts of basalt.”

The output of the field from 1860 to 1887 inclusive is estimated
at 1,580,932 tons of coal, valued at £735,120. It is possible, however,
that between 1860 and 1883 a small proportion of the output credited
to Ipswich was produced at the Burrum. On the other hand, it is
more than likely that a portion of the coal from Clifton may not have
been included in the Returns, as the products of this colliery were to
some extent consumed locally.

This field is geologically a part of the Ipswich Coalfield, Its
output in 1885 was 2,040 tons, valued at £1,020.
Bowen River Coalfield.
This coalfield, although covering a large area, has from its in-
land and elevated position not yet taken rank among the producing
districts of the Colony.
The Coalfield is identifiable by its fossil contents as the
equivalent of the Newcastle (N.S.W.) coal measures (Carbonifero-
Permian). It is divided into three seines ; the lower consisting of
about 880 ft. of yellow and white sandstones and conglomerates and
covered by a series of bedded trappean rocks ; the middle (or marine)
of grey and yellow sandstones, and blue and grey shales with three or
four seams of coal; the upper (or fresh-water) of greyish-green sand-
stones and grey shales, with five or six coal seams of workable
thickness.
Many of the seams at their outcrop are “ coked ” and destroyed by
intrusive sheets of dolerite. From their being rendered hard and ac-
companied by the hard dolerite the “burnt” seams are unfortunately
those which may make their appearance at the surface, while softer
uninjured seams are apt to be covered over by alluvial deposits. A good
seam s|ft. thick was cut in a bore on Pelican Creek at a depth of
310 ft. Another good coal seam 6ft. thick crops out on the same
creek near the bore. Samples from the latter are to be sent to the
Exhibition.

It will be seen from the descriptions of Gympie and other
goldfields that rocks of this age have frequently suffered meta-

Dawson and Mackenzie Coalfield.
The Coal Measures of the Bowen River Series extend from the
heads of the Isaacs River on the North to the heads of the Dawson on
the South, a distance of over 300 miles. In this area several Coal
Seams are known to exist, but have not been worked to any extent.
One thick Coal Seam on Walker’s Creek, near Nebo, is an
anthracite containing a higher percentage of fixed carbon and a lower
percentage of earthy impurities than any Coal of its class known in
Queensland or New South Wales. It approaches in composition
some of the best anthracites of Wales and Pennsylvania.

Opals
The following are localities from which valuable
opals have
been obtained.
The opals are found in nodules of ferruginous siliceous sandstone and siliceous
ironstone, either in the “ Desert Sandstone ” formation or denuded out of it,
and lying on the surface of the underlying “ Rolling Downs ” Formation. The
whole of the area over which the Desert Sandstone extended—the western half
■might therefore be given
of the colony—migh

Artesian Water in the Interior.
The “ Rolling Downs Formation ” of the Western interior has
given rise hy its decomposition to a soil which stands almost un-
rivalled for the nutritive qualities of its grasses, and would be
admirably fitted for agriculture had not nature denied it a sufficient
rainfall.
It is only since the beginning of the present year that this mistake
on the part of nature has been artificially remedied by boring. The
first bore to strike water was that at Barcaldine (691 ft 9in. deep).
This well pours out a stream of water yielding 175,416 gallons per
day, at a temperature of 101 deg. The Artesian Well at Blackall
struck at 1,666 ft., a supply which now overflows (though restricted by
piping), at the rate of 300,000 gallons per day, at a temperature of 119
deg. At Saltern Creek another Artesian Well, 978|ft. deep, yields
17,160 gallons per day, at a temperature of 112 deg. The Sandring-
ham Artesian Well, 140 ft. deep, yields 40,000 gallons per day.
Artesian Water has lately been tapped at Mount Margaret Station,
near Thargomindah, at a still shallower depth.
