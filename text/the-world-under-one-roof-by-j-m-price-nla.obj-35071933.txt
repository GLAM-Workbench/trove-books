An International Parliament
First Steps Toward It
A Question for Pacifists
10 July, 1917,
At the outset, let us mark the distinction between an Inter-
national Parliament and an International Court �f Arbitration,
Turning to civil government for guidance on this point, we
observe that the legislative and the judicial functions of a
state are kept strictly apart. Not only the functions, but the
qualifications for engaging in these two spheres of public ser-
vice are commonly felt to be distinct in character. Although
lawyers are greatly in evidence as legislators, it is extremely
rare to find an individual combining in himself the roles of
parliamentarian and of judge. In keeping with the distinction
are the respectve modes of appointment. For, in common with
other democratic communities, we choose parliamentary repre-
sentatives by popular selection, whereas magistrates and judges
are appointed by government. In the logical order Parliaments
would , appear to come first, since they prepare the laws, while
Courts interpret and administer these finished products of the
Parliaments. But in human history the order seems to be re-
versed, Primitive tribes have their judges, but parliaments
evolve later. It is interesting, therefore, to 'notice that inter-
nationally, while hardly anything exists answering to- even the
rudiments of a world parliament there stands, even now, to
the credit of two Hague Conferences a remarkably efficient
Court of Arbitration as a foundation on which the nations can
build their future system of international judicature.
I should deem it unwise to attempt a cut-and-dried scheme
for an international parliament. Such a body, composed of


vitally active human intelligences, is itself a living thing, and
so may be trusted to care for ts own growth and development.
While at the qutset it may seem that environment shapes this
parliament, it will in the long run be manifest that parliament
is shaping both itself and its environment. Should not our
great aim therefore be, not to elaborately design a parliament,
as though it were a mansion that cannot alter itself; but rather
to plant such rudimentary form of life as we may reasonably
trust will of itself grow into the parliament that is to be?
In assuming, for instance, as we most naturally do, that this
parliament is to be elective, we may have to exercise some
patience. The platform of our A.U.D.C uses the alternative
terms ?Council or Parliament/? Even though a nominee council
should come first upon the scene, shall we not welcome it ?
interesting ourselves about the ways in which it can be
gradually IMPROVED rather than airing our objections be-
cause it does not happen to be the whole loaf for which we
hoped? Even the first English parliament was more like a
nominee council than a represetiwtive house. But the English
people took it in hand. They are not yet through with the
job, I believe. Possibly the method adopted in Australia some
seventeen years ago may find favour. I mean that an inter-
national convention shall draft a constitution to be submitted
in all the civilised states of the world for ratification. But even
if practicable, at a future date, I think it would be premature
just yet. With our six -states, much more uniform in every
way than the world?s forty-six states, the contest was severe,
and led to ugly talk at times, happily overcome by ?the com-
monsense of most.?
Would a LEAGUE TO ENFORCE PEACE, such as pro-
posed in America and by a somewhat kindred association in
Britain, form a suitable nucleus for the future parliament? I
am; of course, aware of the grounds of objection entertained
by some persons to the project; but the practical point, as it
presents itself to me, is, what shall we do if a great majority
of the world?s thinking nations adopt some such proposal? I
take it that we shall all accept the inevitable, recognising in
the step taken by the majority a sincere endeavour to usher
in the reign of peace, and that, whether we deem it the best
way or not, we shall say, ?Now that it has been taken we will
make the best of it.? And that is . how all progress ;? comes


about. It is the anarchist, not the practical reformer, who
declares that the right form of Government cannot possibly
be evolved from wrong forms, who, like the old Persian poet,
would take what he calls ?This sorry scheme of things entire,
w i 0u1d...... shatter it to bits, and then remould it nearer to
the heart?s desire.? The utterances of the very able and repre-
sentative men who speak for this American League to Enforce
JPeace show that they look forward to something like Tenny-
son?s ?Parliament of Man? as its final goal. Prof. J. B. Clarke
said at the first annual conference of The League; ?Out of it
may evolve the Federation that later will convert dreadnoughts
into cargo carriers.? Dr. N* Boyton, another speaker, hoped
that ?The international idea' it represents shall become so
generally accepted that the day may dawn, not far distant,
please God, when the horrors of war shall be things of the
past, and the widening opportunities of peace shall be the pro-
vision for the sons and daughters of men.? It was evident
from the tone of all the distinguished speakers representing
Labour, Commerce, Learning and Religion, that they were in
perfect accord with pacifists that the highest peace, the real
peace, is an unforced peace. But they, in common with many
of us pacifists, believe that enforced peace will be an instru-
ment for bringing it about. If, therefore, the Enforced Peace
scheme is realised, through the decision of a majority of the
world?s citizens, those who worked for it and those who op-
posed it may be able to join hands in a common endeavour
to further the ultimate aim they all have at heart.
But this does not quite dispose of the difference between
them. It may again crop up in connection with the powers of
the destined international parliament. One school will as-
suredly say that the parliament must have the power to coerce,
as precisely all existing parliaments have, while the other
school will deny that necessity. And again the majority will
decide. I have very little doubt which way that decision will
lie* What I want to ask is,, presuming it is in favour of the
power to make the parliamentary mandate imperative, will that
be deemed sufficient reason to restrain some pacifists from
assisting in the instalment of the international parliament?
Possibly some who worked hard last year for an alteration
in the law to ensure six o?clock closing were opposed to the
principle of enforcement by penalty. Yet they must have


known that this ' provision would be incorporated in the Act.
And they knew that to stand out, refusing to work for . any-
thing with compulsion in it, would be to stand aside altogether,
and risk the loss of this coveted reform?which they were very
properly not prepared to do. They are still free, indeed, to
work for the elimination of the element of compulsion if their
faith will stretch to the point of believing that the new Act
would succeed without it. Looking at the matter from this
practical point of view, and avoiding the argument as to
whether the employment of compulsion by governments is
wrong in abstract principle (not because I am unprepared to
discuss it on the ground of principle, but because I do not think
it proper to launch that discussion on you to-night), I think
there are good reasons why pacifists of both schools may con-
sistently work in harmony for the establishment of an inter-
national authority with force behind it.
One objection to the proposal is that the smaller states
will be victimised, and much effort is expended in demon-
strating their value to the world, a value which no one will
deny. On what ground are they alleged to be in danger ?
This: that physical force instead of reason will be the arbiter,
so that only the states with preponderating armaments will
be able to make their views prevail. It is the misfortune of
this argument to contradict the evident facts of the case. Just
now, when no League nor Parliament with power of compul-
sion has yet come into being internationally, the small states
actually are, beyond disproof, at the mercy of unscrupulous
larger states. An empowered international authority would
deliver them from that danger?not into it, for they are in it
already. Such an authority would say, in tones no state, big or
little, would dare to disregard, ?You are not permitted to put
war in place of arbitration.? Servia?s case must be tried by
the arbitrament of reason, or not at all. It shall not be by
the pretended ?arbitrament? of the sword.?
It is equally untrue tq, say that the policeman is the ulti-
mate arbiter in our civil life. That would be to usurp the func-
tions of the judge,?which he does not and could not. Even
in Pennsylvania, by the way, on the testimony of Clarkson,
the biographer of William Penn, the policeman?s baton was
in evidence. But it was not the arbiter. It was there against
the possibility that someone might be tempted to put violence


in place of reason. It was there to prevent violence from
usurping the- function of the arbiter. , T
Let us glance at the question of DISARM AMEN I. It
has been suggested by a theorist, outlining a scheme for an
international parliament, that while this parliament will assume
chief control of all the armies, they will be left in their re-
spective countries under national control unless an interna-
tional crisis requiring their employment arises. Each state?s
army is to be proportional to its population, and its navy pro-
portional to its' coast-line. This, may be ingenious, but is it
not unpractcal and uncalled for ? If, soon after peace is de-
clared, this parliament, or a rudimentary nucleus of hi, should
become fact, the armies and navies then in existence will be
amply sufficient for all that a world authority would deem
necessary. For action they can be pooled on equitable terms.
But under the new conditions their very existence will prevent
their use.
Does, however, this optimistic forecast square with present
facts? The question is a fair one. For answer we must bear
in mind the whole world of difference between a joint ulti-
matum suddenly presented from all the powers, which would
happen, and the tardy, uncertain coming in of, one belligerent
after another, which did happen because the proposed inter-
national machinery for prompt and simultaneous action did
not exist. It is a matter of common remark that had. the cen-
tral powers foreseen the ultimate combination to be arrayed
against them, they would have declined the contest. Yet,
powerful as this combination now is,' it would have been im-
measurably more effective had it automatically come into being
in time to prevent the armies opposed to it from establishing
themselves on foreign soil. In the one case they would have
been intimidated, and could have refrained without loss of
prestige. Now they have to be dislodged at fearful cost, while
their rulers, like Esau, seek in vain for a place of repentance,
for a pretext to ?save their face ?
M Enforced Peace thus staves joff war, and arrests the race
of armaments, for one or two decades, the public sense of
acquired safety will have so knit up the nations, will have so
enhanced the international culture and organisations making
for peace, that war will become at once too difficult and too
repugnant for serious consideration. We say that fear causes
armaments to multiply. It is this vague fear, with the burden


of armaments added, that arrests culture and reform within
and between the states. Disarmament seems by general con-
sent to be regarded as one of the initial tasks of an inter-
national parliament,? to be effected by mutual arrangement
among the states, but under Federal prompting, and either
gradually or suddenly. Admittedly, any powerful nation could
disarm without consulting the others, taking the risk and trust-
ing to its moral effect. This voluntary disarming would make
a stronger appeal than mere defencelessness., That it would
be sublimely successful I am disposed to believe. What I do
not believe, and what I think no one here believes, is that any
nation will so act, which is the real point to consider. Now,
if it is to be a matter of bargaining for a simultaneous reduc-
tion, serious difficulties arise as to the rule or standard to be
adopted. No state admits that it has over-armed, or that its
provision was even adequate. Is a beaten alliance to build
up again? If so, on what scale as compared with the vic-
torious powers? We know what is the attitude ofnhe entente
countries. Along that line- of vision the outlook for disarma-
ment is not encouraging. But is there not a commonsense
way out embodied in the very existence of a parliament with
power to enforce peace?
1. Because it will be felt that armies are no longer so
urgently needed for defence.
2, Because they will no longer be permitted for aggression.
From both points of view the motive for military upkeep
or expansion being undermined, surely the chastened and im-
poverished peoples will not insist on large armies and navies
for mere pleasure or sentiment. Now, to me a state of affairs
wherein the world?s armaments fade gradually away, through ?
sheer disuse, and neglect, unhonoured and unwept, affords an
attractively easy and safe solution of an otherwise thorny
problem.
Consider, too, the opportunities under an. international par-
liament for pacifists to preach peace when audiences are more
hopeful, free at last from the obsession that war may descend
on the unprepared state at any moment like a bolt from the
blue. Again, pacifists will be able to urge with better promise


of success the importing of a more impartial temper into war,?
such cases of war as may. still survive. As yet it seems but
too true in the words of Lecky, the historian, that ?War is
not and never can be the mere passionless discharge of a
painful duty.? Precisely, because without an international
authority war inevitably becomes partisan, boastful and bitter.
It is the sense of responsibility that causes a dignified judge
to break down in the act of pronouncing the awful death sen-
tence. A measure of that would enter even into war in the
altered atmosphere, the object now being to restrain
than to punish. Can we say that the existing war is conducted
in that judicial spirit? The scope for varied pacifist activity
may find further illustration as I proceed, in rough and sketchy
fashion, with the consideration of our subject.
A wag, listening to an indifferent pianist, said that she
fulfilled a scriptural precept, her left hand not knowing what
the right hand did. This mutual understanding between our
bodily organs, the mark of skill, is mediated by the brain,
which brings all other parts of the body into touch. The
bearing of this illustration will presently be seen. All ques-
questions relating to the Federal parliament, its origin, or-
ganisation and methods, will be canvassed in the individual
states, often before that parliament has considered them. But
nothing affecting the principal parliament will be discussed
in any individual state without exciting that parliament?s atten-
ton. And nothing it pays attention to will escape the notice
of any one of all the states. Thus will the newly evolved inter-
national brain draw them together in their discussions. It
will be the whispering gallery in which every state will hear
what is said by every other. How swiftly then political and
social reforms will grow: state vying with state to appro-
priate the best that each cam achieve and attain to!
Such questions as the age qualification for voters, universal
or limited suffrage, an educational test for voters, an educa-
tional test for candidates to the international parliament, pro-
portional voting, payment of members, either by the states at
their own discretion oi>hy the parliament acquiring power to
raise funds, religious ceremonies as part of its functions, times
and places of meeting, and others that will readily occur to the
mind, I will dismiss with the general observation that I should


be sorry to see attempts made to settle them in advance. Their
gradual treatment, in a enabled the new parliament
to exercise its leadership of world-wide discussions, would
strengthen its position and be the means of an ennobling edu-
cation of the human race, a welding of the nations.
, But one may be permitted to forecast an eventful adoption
of elective franchise based on the rule of one representative
to every million of the world?s population able to read and
wpite. that should allay the fears of those who desire that
this parliament shall not be- swamped at its inception. Still
more pleasing to me would be its solution of the British Empire
question, a solution free of artfulness or invidiousness It
would enable Canada, Australasia, South Africa, India, and
other dependencies to be separately represented, yet giving the
empire the same aggregate representation as if its voting were
en bloc. Every province would bring its point of view for the
guidance of the parliament* Yet the racial sentiment that
binds us all would not be lost, Hindoo representatives appre-
ciating- British rule, as evidence shows they now do/would
range themselves with English-speaking members in the main
and the more spontaneously so as they would be free and
unforced. Only about one in every nineteen of India?s popula-
tion now can read and write. The number of literate adults
therefore, is not more than 12k millions! entitling India to
about the same representation as Australia and South Africa
taken together. As it advances in literacy, India may be ex-
pected to advance in political wisdom, and ,in thought touch
with other nations whom it will now meet as their political
ally. Its enlarging share of representation will thus' be amply
safeguarded. India will bring to the council of the nations the
best that Eastern subtlety of thinking has in it In this way,
perhaps, may be solved a probletn that Mr. Lionel Curtis and
his confreres of the ?Round Table? have-called attention to.
One surmises that this parliament would never be dissolved
though, of course, it need not always be in session. If its
membership were renewed by the states somewhat irregularly
that might be an advantage promoting stability, and providing
a check on partisanship.
Should the parliament consist of two houses or only one?


The argument for the bicameral system, as I ' recall it, is
mainly?
1. That it caters for dicerent classes of interests, the upper
house usually representing" property, the lower representing
persons. That reason you may not be disposed to entertain,
and I am not concerned to defend it.
2. That it furnishes a check against hasty legislation.
Verifying instances are not far to seek. Yet suppose this ad-
vantage should be purchased at the price of a long-delayed
reform-blocked to propitiate a vested interest. Or suppose
an unscrupulous or spineless government placates certain asser-
tive elements in its body of supporters by passing bad legila-
-tion in the.: sure and certain-hope of the other house slaying
the infant beyond the chance of resurrection. The government
knows that in good time the voting community at large will
awake and take the matter into its own hands, thus saving
the situation. Now, this final act in the drama has pointed
significance, reminding us that with the people lies the ultimate
decision. The Labour party are, perhaps, not wrong in urging
that the Referendum is an efficient substitute for an upper
house. It has the merit not only of securing government by
the people, but, what is perhaps even more valuable, of educat-
ing the people in political questions, of compelling them; to
think. As we saw by the papers last week, a referendum is
not liked by the self-styled ?National Party,? whose taste is
apparently for rushing through before the people
have realised what is happening. I hope that internationally
there will be but one house, which with its cabinet will shoulder
its own responsibility and keep in touch with its constituents.
Something analogous to the cabinet system seems desir-
able? '
1. To prepare bills for submission to parliament.
2. To-be its executive, to carry out its behests and the awards
of Arbitration Courts if parliament decides to make them
compulsory.
stability and popular control. There are always critics
who fear that such a parliament will break down just when
it needs to be strong. Why, I cannot see. Indeed, the fear
of another school of critics is that the parliament may prove
too strong. Certainly we may expect that it will be - strong


enough to make itself permanent. Democratic governments
are characteristically strong, and Federal governments are
characteristically tenacious of life. It is not written in history
that they flicker out. If this one should blaze up too strongly
well, the people must see to that. What else are political
powers for but for the exercise of popular will upon unpopular
government?
In conclusion if I have suggested topics for discussion, and
if 1 have remmded yog that there will be abundant work for
pacifists, in common with other reformers, not only in getting
an international parliament, but in leading that parliament to
consum mation of its aim and destiny, I shall have
succeeded in what I set out to do.


Arbitration and the Hague
(J* M. Price, February, 1918.)
?That, until such an International Council or Parlia-
ment has been created, Britain shall urge upon the Powers
a resort to the existing Court of Arbitration, or to a Com-
mission of Enquiry, or to other means provided by Hague
Conventions for the avoidance of war.?-?(Clause 4 d in
platform of THE AUSTRALIAN UNION OF DEMO-
CRATIC CONTROL FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF WAR.)
A condensed summary of the work accomplished in this
section by the two Conferences of 1899 and 1907 will prove, I
fear, somewhat dry. Your indulgence is asked, because we
may not evade the task. Most persons are more familiar with
supercilious comments in newspapers on the work of Hague
Conferences than with the studies of scholars competent to
assess that work. The man in the street asks, ?What-is truth??
like jesting Pilate, and waits not for an answer. Yet anyone
can verify for himself that the discussions at Hague Con-
ferences were not Conducted by a motley concourse of vision-
aries and unpractised simpletons, but by level-headed men of
affairs, lawyers of distinction, statesmen, astute diplomats,
authors, and professors whose word on international law car-
ried weight. In sheer weight of ability, as in their represen-
tative capacity, these two assemblages, the second especially,
were unique in the world's history. How well their work was
done is partly -attested by its general acceptance with the
governments to which it was remitted for ratification.
The creation of an INTERNATIONAL PRIZE COURT was
declared by Sir Edward Fry, a jurist of note, to be the most
remarkable of all the measures adopted by the Conference,
?because," said he, ?this is the first time in the history of the
world that there has been organised a truly international
court." To understand this remark we must bear in mind that
this' International Prize Court is a Court of Final Appeal from
all the national Prize Courts, which are themselves courts of


justice as distinguished from merely courts of arbitration.
This appeal court necessarily has the same standing, whereas,
to the legal mind, I believe, an arbitral tribunal is only by
courtesy a court.
The provisions for amicable settlement of international dif-
ferences fall under three heads?
I. GOOD OFFICES AND MEDIATION.
IF COMMISSIONS OF:ENQUIRY.
HE THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION.
Resort to any of these modes of settlement is entirely volun-
tary.
1. GOOD OFFICES AND MEDIATION.
Good Offices: is the more informal of these, and may lead
to Mediation. A friendly power, having induced two contend-
ing states to adopt mediation, is probably aslced to assume
the office of Mediator. In case of serious dispute or of con-
flict, as far as circumstances permit, the powers are to have
recourse to. the good offices or mediation of one or more
friendly powers. Any power may offer good offices even during
hostilities, such offer not to be deemed an unfriendly act.
Acceptance of Mediation cannot of itself stop preparation for
war, nor stop hostilities if begun, unless there is an agreement
that it shall do so. , A Mediator?s duties are
To reconcile opposing claims. '
To appease resentment. ?
His functions cease when it has been declared (a) by either
party
or . (b) by himself .
that the proposed means of reconciliation are not accepted.
Disputants are in no way committed by offers of mediation,
and refusal of an offer is not to be construed as an unfriendly
act.
Provision was made as follows for what is termed ?Special
Mediation.? In case of a serious disagreement, each state at
variance chooses a power. The two chosen powers enter into
communication with each other in an endeavour to avoid a
rupture. During the currency of this mandate, which cannot,
unless Otherwise stipulated, last longer than thirty days, the
states in dispute discontinue direct communications on the sub-
ject. In case of a definite rupture the two mediating powers


still remain charged with the duty to profit by every oppor-
tunity to restore peace.
II ' COMMISSIONS OF ENQUIRY.
Article-9 reads:?
?In differences of an international nature, involving
neither honour nor essential interests, and arising from a
' difference of opinion on matters of. fact, the signatory
powers judge it useful and desirable that parties who have
not been able to come to an agreement by diplomatic nego-
tions should institute, as far as circumstances permit, an
International Commission of Enquiry, charged with aiding
in the settlement of disputes by an impartial and thorough
investigation and statement of facts.?
Most of the 27 articles adopted in connection with Com-
missions of Enquiry relate to methods of procedure, as a guide
to the disputing states, who may be in no mood to calmly
agree upon drawing up a set of rules between them. A special
agreement must be drawn up between the parties, specifying
three things,?
I What facts are to be examined.
2. The extent of the Commissioners? powers
3. The order of procedure.
But the Commission may determine the mode of procedure
if the parties fail to do so.
The choice of Commissioners may be made mutually be-
tween the parties. Or each party may choose two Commis-
sioners, these four to choose their own umpire. But if the
Commissioners fail to agree upon an umpire, they may ask a
third power to select one. But if unable to agree on a third
power to choose to choose an umpire for them they shall each
choose a neutral power, and these two powers shall choose
the umpire.
The contingency of vacancies occurring is provided for.
Both sides are to be heard in the enquiry, each to be in-
formed of -the statements made by its opponent. The parties
are pledged to assist the Commission to the fullest extent with
facilities for complete understanding and exact judgment, to
procure the appearance of witnesses and experts living on
their territory. If such persons cannot appear before the Com-
mission the powers will have them examined before competent


authorities. A witness may refuse to give evidence. Never-
theless, the power on whose territory he resides, permanently
or temporarily, is morally and juristically bound to provide for
his appeaance and testimony/ The -president questions wit-
but other Commisisoners may ask supplementary ques-
tions. Agents for the parties may ask the president to put
certain questions to the witnesses. The enquiry is not to be
public unless decided by the Commission with the consent
of the two parties. The same conditions apply to publication
of the minutes and documents.
The place of meeting is The Hague, r unless another place
shiall be agreed on. A Commission may temporarily adjourn
to another place in search of. information, and may apply to
neutral powers for permission to come upon their territory.
The Commission?s report, by majority vote, signed by all
the members, shall be presented to the disputants. If one
Commissioner refuses to sign, the fact is to be mentioned, but
will not invalidate the report. This Report is not to have the
character of an Arbitral Award, but,to be simply a Statement
of the ascertained Facts, leaving the disputants at liberty as
to the action they may take.
11l THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION.
Both Conferences seem to have bestowed prolonged care
on the fashioning of this Court in the endeavour to forestall
every conceivable occasion of failure or deadlock. Quoting
from the very complete Convention adopted/
??lnternational Arbitration has for its object the settlement
of differences between states by judges of their own choice,
and on the basis of respect for law.?
This simply-worded definition seems, happily, to blend the
democratic idea with a conservative respect for law. Article
20 says:?
?With the object of facilitating an immediate recourse
to arbitration for international differences which have
faled to be settled by diplomatic methods, the signatory
powers to agree to organise a Permanent Court of Arbita-
tion, accessible at all times, and acting, unless otherwise
stipulated by the parties, in accordance with the rules of
procedure included in the present Convention.?
We gather from this clause that The Hague official ma-
chinery, with records : and trained experts, are all available


for the use and guidance of the powers, yet with a generous
recognition of any power?s liberty to take at its own discretion
what seems to suit it and to discard the rest. The document
goes on to say:?
"The Permanent Court shall be competent for all cases
of arbitration unless there shall be an agreement between the
parties for the establishment of a special tribunal.?
Those three words, ?for all cases,? deserve a moment?s
pause. For therein the Conference in plainest speech refuses
to recognise the existence of a dispute not fit for arbitration
or examination. This pronouncement is made with the auth-
ority of the whole civilised world, whose duly accredited repre-
sentatives constituted the Conference. Those delegates were
qualified with instructions to deal with this very question. The
nations can hardly go back on the principle thus laid down.
The Court is domiciled at The Hague, in Holland, an
honour which the Netherlands Government definitely accepted.
Also permanently domiciled at The Hague is THE INTER-
NATIONAL BUREAU. It is an establishment or office con-
tinuously'in session, managed by the consuls of all the nations
accredited to the Netherlands Government, and therefore sta-
tioned at The Hague. All signatory powers, that is, all the
governments that have by signing ratified the acts or conven-
tions of Hague Conferences, contributed to the upkeep of this
Bureau. Its duties include the following:?
To arrange for arbitrations, enquiries and the like, and
attend to them while they are in progress;
keep records of all cases, and communicate informa-
tion, as far as permissible to the signatory powers;
To note and record all other incidents and events of inter-
national interest, and call attention thereto;
To notify the powers of engagements entered into, re-
minding them when occasion arises of the provisions for
dealing with disputes;
And generally to keep in active operation the organisation
of The Hague for the promotion of Peace,


A panel of 130 judges has been appointed by the powers,
the term of office being six years, with liberty to re-elect.
Conference stipulated in one of its articles that these should
he -
?persons of recognised competence in questions of inter-
national law, enjoying the highest moral reputation, and
disposed to accept the duties of arbitrators/?
Lord Bryce was, and may be still, one of the British nomi-
nations to this panel. The courts so far constituted from it
appear to have well maintained the prestige of international
arbitration at the world?s high-water mark.
A court consists of five judges chosen from this panel.
Each disputing state chooses two, one of whom may be a
-citizen of the state that elects him, but the other must not be
either a citizen of that state or one of its nominees to the
panel. The four judges then select an umpire from the panel.
If they cannot agree on the choice a neutral power may be
asked to make it for them, but is debarred from nominating
one who has already been rejected by the judges. Or if that
expedient fails, two powers chosen respectively by the dis-
puting powers may be invited to find an umpire. But if those
two powers fail to agree they shall nominate two candidates
each, and from this group of four the umpire is to be drawn
for by lot. All this is typical of the meticulous care taken
throughout to make smooth the approach 40 arbitration, and
ensure a successful accomplishment. In all, 28 articles are
devoted to the task. Two aims were kept in view:?
? 1. To spare contending states, already mutually irritated,
perhaps, the embarrassing task of drawing up a scheme of
arbitration together.
2. To promote uniformity of practice.
The two states about to arbitrate must draw up and sign
an act or compromise in which the following eight points are
dealt with. A happy finality in the case may depend on the
thoroughness of this preliminary understanding. A genuine
service is rendered by the Conference in setting out the points,
and presenting to the parties in dispute just a form with ques-

3. The period allowed, for appointment of the arbitrators.
4. The form, order and time of preliminary examination
and discussion.
5. The sum of money to be deposited by each side in ad-

6. The method of appointing arbitrators.
7. The place of meeting and the language of the tribunal
8. The period within which the parties must present their
case in writing. But this period may afterwards be prolonged
by consent of the parties or by the tribunal. And even the
filling up of this form is not to operate as a bar to arbitration.
For if the parties cannot agree in completing it they may ask
the court to do it for them.
The court has power to make its own interpretation of
treaties and of international law, to regulate the admission of
evidence, the time allowed each side, the language or lan-
guages to be used (if not already determined), and the pub-
licity or privacy of procedure. Provision is made for the
appearance of advocates or agents, for the recording of
minutes, for the production of papers and explanations de-
manded by the tribunal, and the communication of such to
the side that has not seen them. Also for the preparation,
signing and publication of the Award.
On the important question of APPEALS it was decided
that no appeal is permitted to another court, but re-hearing by
the original court may be arranged for on conditions laid down
by the Conference, such as the discovery of new facts after
the ; case had closed.
The signing of the Agreement to Arbitrate carries with
it a pledge to submit in good faith to the Award. This is
otherwise expressed by saying that the Award is obligatory.
Here we note
h That ?obligatory? means morally binding,? not ?com
puis ory.?


? 2. That it is binding only on the states joined as parties
to the suit. If a number of states choose fo intervene as in-
terested parties while a case is before the court, they will, of
course, accept the Award.
For issues of a minor nature a much simplified code of
procedure is laid down,-?but I forbear!
Critics, lightly passing censure upon what they vaguely
term ?The Hague? for its failure to prevent this war, yield
unconscious testimony to this striking fact, that the two Con-
ferences of 1899 and 1907 have fixed vividly in the public mind
the great idea of a world governed by law instead of by war.
Just now it finds expression as a disappointed hope. ?We
hoped, indeed, it was The Hague that should redeem this world
from war, yet see this is the fourth year of war?s continuance.?
Ours be it as pacifists to keep alive that ideal, ours to create
the confident expectation ?These things shall be,? and above
all to inculcate that spirit of chivalry toward neighbouring
nations, whether rivals or not, by which alone the ideal can
become a fact.
?More nor less to. others paying,
That by self offences weighing/?
said our national poet. But the sentiment of those lines seems
hardly patriotic to some of our friends. Mentioning to one
such the plan for international co-operation after the war, with
Germany included, I was met with this remark, ?I am afraid
that will not be possible.? Does ?Not possible? really mean
?Not welcome??' ?O' wad same power the giftie gie us!? The
spirit of Pharisaism rebuked by Jesus in individuals is not less
detestable in nations, and far more dangerous. We may not
blame ?The Hague? for that! Centuries before the Christian
era the Greeks had an Amphictyonic Council, operating as a
loose federation over the Grecian tribes or states, whose watch-
word was that though Greeks might sometimes fight among
themselves, ?they should always quarrel as those who mean
some, day to be reconciled.? Is it presumptuous to hope that
we may some day- lift warring Christian nations to the level
of that exquisite old heathen sentiment?
Among the measures for doing so I would assign a place
y tQ such merely external arrangements as? The Hague stands


for, because they are suggestively educative as well as prac-
tically instrumental. Like that beautiful statue of The Christ
reared on the Andes between Chile and Peru, the outward
expedients constantly remind the nations of a something to
which they point, something intrinsically nobler than war. Nor
does suggestion end here. There is suggestion also in the
fact of authoritative prevention, which I hope the next Hague
Conference will enact. When forbidden to emulate that general
of ancient story who with his sword cut the Gordian knot he
had been invited to untie, we are thrown back upon our finer
instincts, and these instruct us that patience and self-discipline
are the mark of a higher development than the brute im-
patience that wields the sword. If, as sometimes one hears,
that old story is deemed symbolical of the sword?s capacity
for solving knotty problems, it is a symbol misplaced, for his-
tory laughs that claim to scorn. Make it prohibitive to cut
the knot. We dearn to untie it, instead. And it is a moot
point?which is the greater gain, the untied knot or the victory
of soul that it has meant Two quarrelsome soldiers who could'
never be at one time outside the guardroom without fighting
were set by the baffled commandant to clean the barrack
windows conditionally that while one was cleaning the outside
of a window the other should face him from the inside. At
first they scowled and glared; then laughed, and finally shook
hands. One of the depraving effects of war is seen in those
who remain behind, clamouring for ?a fight to the bitter end/?
?to smash Germany,? while many thoughtful soldiers in their
trenches are pleading for ?a generous peace.? When a nation
magnanimously and with candour examines all claims made
upon it from without, resolutely setting its own claims in an
international perspective, and seeks to avoid not only war but
the passions that warp judgment and lead to war, it is on the
high road to the only real greatness for a nation, that which
lies in the character of its individual citizens. ?Peace with
Honour?? Say rather, ?Peace through Honour!?
Nothing short of this objective would have satisfied the
mind of William Penn, whose scheme for a European Parlia-
ment saw the light more than two centuries before the first
Hague Conference was called. Two of his clauses read;?-


?4. That before this sovereign Assembly shall be brought
all differences depending between one sovereign and another
that cannot be adjusted by diplomatic means, before its ses-
sions begin.?
?5. That if any of the sovereignties constituting this Im-
perial Diet should refuse to submit their claims- or pretensions
to the Diet, or to accept its judgment, and seek their remedy
by arms, or delay compliance beyond the time specified, all
the other sovereignties, uniting their forces, should compel
submission to, and performance of, the sentence and payment
of all costs and damages.?
Penn followed a very old precedent in vesting legislative
and judicial functions in one body. Airily his Assembly calls
up disputes for settlement and clears them off the board be-
fore its sessions begin?-?like the soup and fish that are the
prelude to the banquet proper. ? WE have'learnt to distinguish
between the legislator and the judge, -and. to see that division
of labour makes for better workmanship. The phrase ?trial
and error? has been used to sum up the method of human pro-
gress If the errors are made in our parliaments, the trials
are made in our courts of law. Not merely cases but laws are
tried there. Parliaments know this, and much of statute law
is indebted to the independent testing of the courts. They
are able so to help each other by being kept distinct. It this
is true in civil affairs, why not internationally? Let us never
confuse an international parliament with an international
court.
Penn also proposed compulsion, as we see by his clause
No S and this not only against those who make war without
first resorting to arbitration, but also against those who neg-
lected to carry out an award. His scheme knows nothing o
The Hague system of ?Good Offices? and ?Mediation and
?Commissions of Enquiry.? Were he alive to-day he would
surely see how impracticable it is to attempt enforcement for
example of a Commission?s finding of the facts. What is there
to enforce? The parties are purposely left free to devise their
own remedy in mutual ? amity and commonsense The appeal
to honour and good sense would be fatally marred by the least
suggestion of compulsion. But if Penn to-day were to concede
that a Commission?s finding is beyond the pale of ? compulsion,


might he still maintain that an arbitral award should be en-
forced?' - Well, we think of the-Pacifist claim that of the more
than 600 cases known to history not one single award has been
flouted. Whence, then, the need for compulsion? At the
Milan Peace Conference some ten years ago it was stated that
three instances of repudiation were known. All three con-
cerned the United States, two being with Hayti, in which the
United States on enquiry frankly concurred in Hayti?s protest
against the awards, and adjusted the difference in a friendly
manner. The third instance was that of a case between the
U.S. and Salvador, and the . arbitrator, Judge ? Penfold, intro-
duced himself to Dr. Daby (Secretary of London Peace Society),
assuring him that while Salvador impeached the-award she did
not repudiate it. A friendly settlement ensued. Thus ended
the attempt to show that history does record repudiations.
All it showed was that .provision for appeal is requisite, and
this The Hague has already seen to. But if compulsory ob-
servance of awards fails to stand on the ground of necessity,
it seems equally untenable on the ground of good taste. Lord
Alverstone,' late Chief Justice- of ; England, and Mr, Balfour
Browne, K.C., President of Leeds Law Students? Society, con-
cur in emphasising the difference between arbitration and
ordinary legal process. Arbitration, they affirm, is a matter ot
honour, and cannot appropriately be associated with compul-
sion. , ? ' ?
For these reasons I am sorry that The League of Nations
advocated in England proposes compulsory observance of ar-
bitral awards. The American League does not. Its only com-
pulsion is to refrain from war till arbitration or other peaceful
measures have been tried, which in practice means at least a
year?s postponement. Very sensibly, as I conceive, The Ameri-
can League to Enforce Peace recognises that when you have
persuaded the powers Vo surrender all their time-worn reser-
vations by agreeing to submit all cases to arbitrtaion jpr con-
ciliation without exception or reserve, it is too much to expect,
in the present state of sentiment, that they will also bind them-
selves beforehand to any award that may be given. Even in
regard, to a Commission?s finding, which, as we have seen,
differs from an award, and could not be enforced, a proposal
is by Mr. J. A. Hobson and some other members


of the English League that an International Council shall , con-
vert every such ?finding? ipto an ?award,? and then enforce
that award. Thus they would relegate to a Council, instead of
to a duly qualified court, a grave and delicate judicial opera-
tion, the forming of an award out of a mere statement of facts.
And it has been pointy out that cases of this class, that is,
those sent to a Commission of Enquiry in preference to a
Tribunal, furnish most of the reservations. It will not argue
much regard for the scruples of the parties to such cases thus
to override their intentions. Indeed, there would seem to be
no further use for a Commission of Enquiry, such as averted
war between Russia and Great Britain, if this highhanded pro-
ceeding is to be carried out.
Coming back to the main question, in my humble opinion,
the less said the better about compulsory enforcement of either
awards or findings. Is it not of far greater moment to ensure
the sending to The Hague of all cases, without distinction or
reservation, leaving to Providence what afterwards may take
place? The risk of war breaking out as the ultimate sequel
of all the League?s prolonged efforts to avoid it seems to me
a very small one. The factors working against it will be
cumulative. It is always competent for other powers to inter-
vene for war?s prevention, by moral suasion, or by threats of
either a military or an economic character, and will be just as
easy after the presumed failure of the year?s delay under an
Enforced Peace League as at any other time. Far more easy,
indeed, for an expert discussion by international jurists, lasting
over a year, and involving the peace of the world, will in-
fallibly gain the world?s attention. This tendency is a growing
one. It seems difficult to conceive of a more effectual deter-
rent of war than this enforced delay, giving opportunity for
the canvassing of issues by an intelligent public ?in calm of
mind, all passion spent.? As one?s memory ranges over the
important wars of the last two or three generations, the im-
pression deepens that they began in utter confusion of the
public mind concerning the reasons for them?where any such
existed. The people, who had to foot the bill and supply
the human ?food for powder,? knew about as much even after
all was over as old Jasper in Southey?s celebrated poem. Some-
times war is drifted into through misunderstanding; to wiff


the stupid cry, ?Remember the Main/? which sent mad the
people of the United States. Sometimes it is precipitated, on
one side cunningly, on the other hysterically, as in 1870. In
most cases the responsible few who pressed the button were
inadequately informed, while the people knew less than
nothing, because the so-called ?information? supplied to them
was tainted?or censored? to speak' in modern parlance. The
present war, the most awful in all history, took even statesmen
by surprise,?-so we are told. But had Europe?s people been
given the chance to examine the issues deliberately a way
would have been found to avert the catastrophe.
To The Hague, then, let us look for this salutary delay*
and for the publicity that will inevitably ensue. Nothing will
so effectively promote democratic control of foreign policy,
with cards laid honestly upon the. table, because Hague enquiry
and adjudication will increasingly drag into the wholesome
sunlight that sewer-like diplomacy from which humanity has
so much to fear. The Hague will do it for us if we but enable
The Hague to come into its own.
