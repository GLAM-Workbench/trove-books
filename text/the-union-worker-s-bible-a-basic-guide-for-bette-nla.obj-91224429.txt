INTRODUCTION
This union believes in the dignity of
man and the American way of life. We
believe, therefore, in you and hope to
gain your respect by deserving it.
Your union's progress is similar to that
made by American industry. The ingenu-
ity and hard work of all were the reasons
for our accomplishments.
We now point with pride to the major
contribution we are making to the prog-
ress of our country. Management and
labor working together in a free econ-
omy made this possible.
In an effort to stimulate further under-
standing, we invite you to read, analyze
and discuss the following pages.
Record pertinent phone numbers, and
other important data on the last page,
and keep this handbook with you at all
times.


“Success is a ladder which cannot be
climbed with our hands in our pockets”


YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
Because you are a union member you
have many advantages and privileges.
However, every mature individual knows
that privileges mean responsibilities.
Your duties to your union are as
follows:
Practice as well as preach unionism.
Judge your fellow worker by his
actions, not by his color, creed, or
religion.
Cooperate with your union repre-
sentatives by giving them all the
facts concerning a grievance.
Support your leadership by never
doing anything that will lose re-
spect for your union.
We cannot expect cooperation from
the company unless we ourselves are
united, and all are willing to do theit
part.

“The truth shall make you free.”


YOUR UNION
The following are two major sources
union-member misunderstanding. Let
discuss them clearly.
“The union should be doing more
than it is.”
Answer: There are times when to
you the union seems to be moving
very slowly. However, it is well to
remember that Labor Relations is a
complicated affair. All problems need
study, meetings have to be arranged,
differences of opinions listened to,
and ironed out. All of this takes
time. A grievance or contract nego-
tiated hurriedly can cause great
harm. Your union is doing all it can,
as quickly as it can to further your
personal gains. However, we must
always keep in mind that while im-
proving our own status, that we do
not destroy the healthy business
economy of our employer.


“The past is today’s greatest teacher.”


Answer: No fair individual can ig-
nore the fact that history proves that
unions have accomplished miracles
to improve the lot, not only of the
worker, but his company and country
as well. Unions have: promoted se-
curity, have given all a chance to
advance, have assured more human
treatment and dignity, and have
amicably settled thousands of dis-
putes. It is gross ignorance to accuse
all unions because a few have dis-
credited themselves.
The records show that unions are
making, and will continue to make
valuable contributions to higher
standards of life.
The workers who make up your
union are typical American citizens
who are united not only for their
own individual welfare, but for the
well being of all. Be proud you are
a union member.


Americanism is a privilege, not a
heritage”


YOUR COUNTRY
The facts are plain:
We as Americans have personal free-
dom (without which, life is not worth
living).
We have the highest standard of liv-
ing (greater comfort, security, and
safety).
We have equality of opportunity (all
men have the right to succeed).
Privileges also mean responsibilities;
you as an American are:
1. To study, understand, and partici-
pate where possible in public affairs.
2. To have faith, confidence, and be
willing to work for the good of the
nation.
3. In a manly, intelligent manner be
ever willing to uphold these princi-
ples to all who would destroy them.


“ Trust — Cooperation —T eamwork ”


CONCLUSION
Your Union is trying and will continue
to strive for all things that will truly
benefit you and the country as a
whole.
Your Company —There is opportunity for
you in your company; therefore, do
the best you can.
Your Country —Americanism originates
in the heart. Talking Americanism
isn’t enough— be one in all your
actions.
We of the union management want
you to know that we are very proud of
the progress we have made, and are
looking forward to an even greater
future.
