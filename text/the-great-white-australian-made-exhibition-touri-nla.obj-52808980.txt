SOUVENIR OF THE ‘•AUSTRALIAN-MADE" EXHIBITION TRAIN.
The Story of the‘Australian-Made’ Preference League
The ‘Australian-Made* Preference League,
as its name implies, is an organisation which
exists to educate Australians to appreciate
the importance of giving preference, in all
their purchases, to “Australian-Made.”
1 he League is non-party and non-sectionai,
and numbers among its members every sec-
tion of the community.
It has the honor of claiming as Patron
His Excellency Sir Dudley de Chair, and its
President, Peter Board, Esq., C.M.G., is
known throughout the length and breadth
of the State for the valuable service* he
rendered as Director of Education.
The League is performing a national ser-
vice in oointing out to Australians how they
may assist in the development of their
country, and, in consequence, captains of
industry, professional men, representatives
of pastoral and agricultural interests, Trades
Hall executives, factory employees and lead-
ing women's organisations are all giving
valuable assistance.
The League is endeavouring to get Aus-
tralians to realise that by insisting on
“Australian-Made” they guarantee that the
factories already in operation will be kept
fully occupied supplying the demand, and as
this demand grows ever stronger, additional
factories and workshops will be called into
being to meet it.

ITS AIMS AND OBJECTS
These additional factories will give work
to Australians, and, moreover, open up ave-
nues of employment for the fopuiation that
will flock to these shores when flourishing
manufacturing industries guarantee them
“jobs.”
And this influx of population is what the A
primary producers of Australia badly nead, 5
for it will mean a greatly extended home A
market for their products, and, as all history A
has proved, the home market is always the
most profitable market.
It is evident, therefore, that the League A
is already helping the country districts. X
But it wants to do still more, and as it A
is of opinion that many of the country dis- &
tricts have excellent facilities for the carry- A
ing on of successful manufacturing enter- A
prises, the League is using its best endeav- S
ours to have manufacturing industries A
established in country centres. S
This will mean providing employment for S
the boys and girls, making it unnecessary A
for them to leave their home-towns when
they need employment. A successful fac-
tory will, moreover, mean a good buyer for q
the primary producers of the district. It A
will, finally, mean better and brisker trade yt

j I
"Australian-Made" goods are now
receiving the biggest practical boosting
they have ever had.
Record attendances and the greatest
enthusiasm mark the progress of the
Great White Train. Its triumphant
entry into every town and the warmth
of the welcomes already extended it,
stamp it as the greatest advertisement
yet attempted.
The widespread interest created is
amply demonstrated by the enthusiasm
so universally displayed and the most
confirmed pessimist could not hep but
admit that Australian manufactures are
going to receive a wonderful ■ fillip re-
sulting from the tour of this compre-
hensive exhibition on wheels.
The general consensus of opinion is
that the train is filling a long-felt want.
It is not only advertising “Austra-
lian-Made” goods, but it is selling them
far better than the most skilled of
human salesmen could hope to do.
It is creating an impression that
will never be wiped out of the minds
of those who have seen it. An IM-
PRESSION THAT WILL SELL
"AUSTRALI AN-MADE. ’ ’
For the first time in Australian his-
tory. Australian people are being edu-
cated about Australian products in a
practical manner.
The tramp, tramp of hundreds of 5
feet that are daily passing down the 5
corridors of exhibits are sounding the £
death-knell to foreign imports.
Patriotism never was, is not, and 8
never will be, dead in the heart of an S
Australian, and the same men and
women of the great out-back who ral-
lied to the aid of the nation in war-
time, will just as readily prove patriots
in peace by rallying round the trade-
marks of “Australian-Made" goods.
The day is dawning when a great
Australian public will think "Austra-
lian-Made," speak “Australian-Made,”
eat “Australian-Made,” and wear
“Australian-Made.” Then and then
only will this great country of ours
turn its face in the direction of per-
petual prosperity.
The public of the present day de-
mand the rigid enforcement of a White
Australia policy as applied to humans,
to prevent the country being over-run
with colored foreign races. The
SAME POLICY SHOULD APPLY TO
FOREIGN MANUFACTURES.
The progress and prosperity of Aus-
tralia is in the hands of the Australian
people themselves, and the present
generation is answerable to the genera-
tions of the future for the destiny of
the land.

The Council has installed electricity scheme, and at present a water
scheme costing £30,000 is now nearing completion.
The population has Increased by over 1,000 during the past 15 months,
hut the want of house accommodation retards a fast increase in population.
Queanheyan is considered one of the healthiest towns of N.S. Wales,
and is practically free from all epidemics.
The present Council consists of Aid. W. B. Freebody (Mayor), and Ald-
ermen J. G. Harris, E. F. Land, G. A. Mclnnes, T. E. Woodger, H. T. Land,
J. W. Sproule, H. C. Taylor, and H. Johnston.

The present Town Clerk, Mr. J. Ff. Hincksman, has occupied that office
for nearly 35 years, and Miss Hudson is Assistant Clerk.
A new Hospital, costing £B,OOO. is to be erected in the near future.
Part of the funds are already in hand.
Nearly the whole of the land in the Municipality has been sub-divided,
and this applies to Shire Lands adjoining.
New hotels are being erected, one of 70 rooms, to cost £30,000, and
a new structure in place of the present Royal Hotel is now in course of
erection to cost £22,000.
In all respects Queanheyan is due to become a large town, and Mr.
H. Y. Adams, Police Magistrate who declined the same important position at
Dubbo at a higher salary deciding to remain at Queanheyan, and which he
states will eventually become a city. No doubt this is due to being the Free-
hold Cencre nearest the Federal Territory, which is leasehold tenure.
Queanheyan residents are anticipating much enthusiasm in the arrival
of the Great White Train.
