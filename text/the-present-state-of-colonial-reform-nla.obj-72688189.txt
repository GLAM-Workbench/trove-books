Pacific, surrounded by innumerable islands, the inhabitants of some of which
are just emerging from a savage stat�, and have abolished their idolatry, and
received the light of the Gospel?Australia may be regarded as the nucleus
of civilization and Christianity in the Pacific. When we contemplate her
present advance, in conjunction with the wonderful change effected in the
Society and the Sandwich Islands, by the efforts of Christian Missionaries,
we look forward at no distant period to the whole of Australasia and Poly-
nesia, becoming as enlightened as the western w r orld.
THE CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
THE PRESENT STATE OF COLONIAL REFORM.
? Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; 1 ? and he who feels for the de-
gradation and misery of his fellow-creatures under the galling yoke of West
Indian slavery, must endure this sensation with peculiar aggravations. A
faintness comes over the spirit, as he reflects upon the melancholy fact that
800,000 beings of his own blood, subjects of the same sceptre, possessing all
the qualifications w T hich would render them happy in a state of civilization
and freedom, are retained by men calling themselves Christians, by men
bearing the name of Britons, and therefore lovers of liberty, in a state of
the most grievous and intolerable bondage. How distressing to humanity
is the consideration that another year has passed without any national act to
wipe away this reproach. 11 is but too evident that there is something in the
very nature of slavery which hardens the heart, and renders it callous to
the finer feelings of humanity. Individuals, when they enter the atmos-
phere where this pestilence spreads its influence, seem speedily affected by
it, and cease to regard it as an evil of any great magnitude. The white
man considers his sable brother as a being of inferior rank, and imbibing the
prejudices and opinions of the privileged class among whom he associates,
ceases to view slavery as a crime, for familiarity with any evil, soon lessens
our sense of its enormity. This, we think, sufficiently accounts for the dis-
tressing fact, that Europeans, on going to the West Indies, frequently
change their opinions on the subject of slavery, and become imbued with
the sentiments of the planters, on the necessity for its existence. The ques-
tion is however, simply, a moral one, ?all expediency and necessity and
human authority is nugatory. By what right but that of force, and that
too, force of the most brutal character, does the West Indian slave-holder
claim a property in the blood of his fellow-creatures. We assert, then,
that if the original tenure by which he holds possession of them be founded
on injustice, fraud, and oppression, that the sooner the chains by which
they are encircled be broken, the better. Every year suffered by the peo-
ple of this country to elapse without removing this Ami stain upon our
honour, as men and Christians, accumulates an additional mass of responsi-
bility of a fearful character. We are willing to believe that the efforts of
the abolitionists of Great Britain have aroused the natural sensibilities of
the heart, and have not appealed in vain to those principles of benevolence
and religion which animate a large proportion of our fellow countrymen.
We believe that the attention of the most influential sex has been aw r akened
to the consideration of this subject, and that many of those publications
which have circulated so widely have been written by females, who are
keenly alive to the wrongs, the unredressed wrongs of the natives of Africa.
This we regard as a cheering state of things, our children will, at least, be
imbued by their mothers with an abhorrence of this thraldom, and it may
be reserved for them to accomplish that, for which we may perhaps, toil
and labour in vain, ?the total abolition of the slave trade and the anni-
hilation of slavery.
Notwithstanding the unequivocal expression of public opinion, we find
that the slave colonies in general are unwilling to adopt any means, even
for the gradual abolition of such an evil as that of slavery. From


a late publication by the Anti-Slavery Society,* the melancholy fact
is apparent, that any expectation that the wishes of the nation will be
accomplished by the advocates of slave tyranny is founded on entire igno-
rance of the individuals with whom the Christian philanthropist has to
contend. We assert it as our unqualified opinion, that if ever the ? unani-
mous resolutions of Parliament, and the universal prayer of the nation are
to be effectual, it must be by an energetic and authoritative act. There
exists on the part of the West Indians, not a mere disinclination, but a
determination not to submit to any request to improve the condition of the
slave population. Regarding them as property , (oh! that man should
thus abuse the energies and powers with which'the Divine Being has en-
dowed him,) they insist on their inalienable right to retain possession of
that property in the manner they deem most efficient. Thus we find that
with the exception of Trinidad, the most favoured of the islands under
the British Government, nothing has really been accomplished for the
improvement of the slaves, or the sbolition of slavery. Now it is worthy
of notice, that even here, the Order of the King in Council was not adopted
without much acrimonious disputation, and at last u it became necessary
to resort to compulsion;? and .the Order in Council was imposed and en-
forced by the peremptory mandate of the Sovereign. This, too, be it remem-
bered, is the only instance, and from the circumstance of its being enforced,
every reform introduced is ? encountering the decided and avowed hos-
tility of the whole white population.?
We ask then, if this be the case with an island, subject immediately to tjie
Crown, what is there to hope for in any of those who are directed by their
own assemblies? Nothing. Indeed, whoever examines the few 7 pretensions
at improvement which have been made by three or four of the colonial
legislatures, will at once observe, that there is no real perception on their
part of the horrors of slavery, and consequently no disposition to diminish
their existence, and he will discover a spirit as uncompromising in resisting
any progress towards its ultimate abolition as we hope to find existing here
for its speedy and utter extinction.
Ihe few improvements which have here and there been adopted, fall so
far saort of the requirements of the country, and so completely shut out
the prospect of abolition at any period, that we are persuaded they have
been enacted only to juggle the nation.
Only five of the Colonies, out of thirteen, having legislatures of their
own, have done any thing whatsoever towards carrying the resolutions of
the ? House of Commons,? of the 15th May, 1823, into effect; and
Of these five,
None have done any thing with respect to religious instruction.
One (1 ohago) has abolished Sunday markets.
Four (Tobago, Grenada, St. Vincent?s and Dominica) have given a
very limited protection, in certain cases, to the property of Slaves.
Iwo (Tobago and Grenada) have lowered the scale of arbitrary pu-
nishment by the master.
1 wo (Gi enada and St. Vincent?s) have made a mere show of abolishing
the driving-whip.
Three (Tobago, Grenada, and St. Vincent?s) have admitted the evi-
dence of Slaves in a very limited degree.
IS one have given to the Slave the power of effecting his manumission by
purchase. �
One (Bahamas) has legalized marriage, and two (Grenada and St.
Vincent?s) have permitted it in certain cases.
One (Bahamas) has prohibited the separation of families, either by
private or judicial sale; and One (Grenada) has prohibited it by judicial sale.

THE SPIRIT AND
None have abolished the flogging of females.
None have prohibited the sale of Slaves detached from the estate.
None have established saving banks.
And now, after reading this meagre statement, let any man look care-
fully at the vain and inefficient, and often contradictory and unjust provi-
sions, by which it is pretended to ensure even the scanty measure of im-
provement which the most partial advocate of the Colonies can deduce
from these papers, and he must feel convinced, that no useful or consistent
legislation is to be expected by continuing to pursue the present course.
Delay and disappointment can be its only results. ?
Such is the extent of colonial improvement during three years! And yet
we are twitted continually with the assertion, that the West India planters
are men sensibly alive to the best feelings of humanity and among the
most benevolent of mankind. We blush for the effrontery of any man
who can assert claims to our regard, and call on us ;to abate our efforts
in the cause of justice and humanity founded on such visible proofs of
cruelty ?deception?and confirmed obduracy of heart. To talk of im-
provement in the condition of the poor Negro, while the principal evils
under which he groans in his state of bondage are unmitigated, is mockery
and insult.
But will the Christians of Great Britain, who have resolved on the ex-
tinction of slavery, be satisfied with the results of this improvement?
Will they be satisfied with the fact that none of the Colonies have done
any thing with respect to religious instruction ? ?lt is evident that the advo-
cates of things as they are, while they contend that the slave is unfitted
for freedom, are determined never to lend their efforts to qualify him for
this condition. They will not aid any plans which impart religious
instruction, the surest and safest basis on which to erect the superstructure
of liberty.
Will they be satisfied with the fact that? none have given to the slave
the power of effecting his manumission by purchase ? Does this evince
any desire to remove the evil at any period.
None have abolished the flogging of females. Boasted humanity?where
art thou ! Men! men of our own colour?our own blood?professing our
own religious opinions, and refusing to abolish a practice revolting to de-
cency?abhorrent to all manly feeling?and an outrage upon every Chris-
tian principle. What shall we say to this?if this be a fair specimen of
Colonial improvement? Will it satisfy, ought it to satisfy, the just, the
righteous demands of the abolitionists of this country ?
Certainly not! never will we cease to lift up our voice against this
national sin. Although we have too long been unconcerned, and criminally
callous to the unmerited injuries we have contributed to inflict on so many
of our brethren, we are now roused to a sense of our guilt, and we are
resolved never to abandon the cause we have espoused; till the natural
rights of our African brethren shall be restored. We care not for the
charge of ?wild fanaticism? brought against us by the Colonists?a regard
for insulted humanity?a love for the principles of freedom?a high feeling
of honour for the reputation and the glory of our country, and above all, a
supreme sense of our duty as Christians, urge us to persevere. We
appeal with confidence to every virtuous bosom?to every heart influenced
by the gospel of the Son of God, and we urge them to spread information
on the subject among every class of people, so that when another oppor-
tunity shall be given of bringing this question before the great council of
the nation, it may be accompanied with overwhelming influence. If the
nation be but firm in its resolve, to put down this monstrous iniquity, a
few years will serve to convince the besotted and blind adherents to an
enslaved population, that they were their best friends who wrested the
iron rod of oppression from their grasp, and taught them to look for their
security and prosperity to the most effectual of all laws by which mankind
can be governed* those of gratitude, of principle, and of religion.
