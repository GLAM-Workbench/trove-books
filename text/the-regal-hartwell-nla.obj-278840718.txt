When you return home cold and possibly wet,
think of the joy of having healthy, glowing

that soothes and satisfies.
Don't spend a cheerless hour before retiring,
but relax in the comfort of a new Gas Fire.
You'll avoid the risk of chill .... and you'll
sleep better .... if you're warm.

A Message from the Directors
With a distinct sense of pride, and complete confidence in the future, we open
to you the doors of the Regal Theatre.
This is the golden age of the cinema; millions of pounds are being invested in
the production of bigger and better pictures . . . the public and critics agree
that films to-day are better than ever.
It is only fitting, therefore, that a scientifically constructed modern house of enter-
tainment should be within easy reach of your home so that you may view, in
resplendent comfort and ideal surroundings, the best entertainment that Holly-
wood, England and Australia has to offer.
Just a few of the unusual features of this theatre are a commodious car park at
the side of the theatre; an indoor bicycle park; a spacious roof garden; ample
parking space indoors for perambulators; a soundproof nursery where mothers
with babies can enjoy the show; modern air-conditioning; and the last word in
sound-reproducing and biograph equipment.
The Directors of the Hartwell Theatre Company have concluded arrangements
with Hoyts Theatres Limited and Junction Theatres Pty. Ltd. which will make
available for the Regal Theatre the finest selection of films secured by Hoyts
Theatres Ltd. for its circuit of theatres —the largest throughout Australia.
Patrons, therefore, will be assured of a continuous supply of . the best film produc-
tions from every corner of the world. '' . . ,
Truly it can be said that the Regal Theatre will offer you the facilities for brighter
and better entertainment. We hope you will make it your home for many happy
hours of relaxation. , , T ..
The Regal Theatre is owned and operated by Hoyts Theatres Ltd. and Junction
Theatre Co. Pty. Ltd.

Modernity, plus convenience, you will find to
be the features of the Regal entrance foyer.
A ticket box, unique in its conception any-
where in the world, rears itself with massive
strength to the ceiling, where it is almost lost
in glorious pools of light.
Spacious stairways lead to the Dress Circle,
and easy access to the stalls is assured.
Brilliant with its concealed lighting, this en-
trance foyer is a fitting "first impression" to
the comforts which are beyond it.

DUNLOPILLO
Cushioning
"Life's Latest Luxury"
Dunlopillo Cushioning is made direct
from Latex, the natural milk of the rub-
ber tree. It is vastly different from
ordinary sponge rubber, which is made
from solid sheet rubber, for it has the
overwhelming advantage of being fully
porous, a feature which ordinary sponge
rubber has never been able to achieve.
Dunlopillo is composed ot millions ot
tiny inter-connected air ceils. As there
are no impervious skin, the outside at-
mosphere has full access through each
unit, which breathes automatically when
depressed and released. This means that
a Dunlopillo unit is always cool and
properly aired, an immense advantage
over every other form of cushioning
material. It is supremely hygienic for
another reason it definitely repels
germs, moths and vermin.

The Historic Site
of the Regal Theatre
® Time Marches On! But for the sake of old memories we will en-
deavour to trace back for you some of the historic and memorable associa-
tions with the site upon which the ultra-modern Regal Theatre now stands.
According to information we have gathered, the Tyrone Hotel, which stood
on this corner until a few years ago, was built 90 years ago from locally
hand-made bricks of clay. It derived its name from County Tyrone, Ireland.
Right through the last century and in the gay nineties, it was a popular
rendezvous for all kinds of sportsmen. Gaily dressed hunters from the Mel-
bourne Hunt Club, following the hounds, would tether their horses and
moisten their parched throats before continuing the chase over the wilds of
Hartwell and Camberwell! 1
The Tyrone Hotel was often dulled with the smoke from local bush fires, and
imperilled with neighboring floods.
Among sporting men it will be remembered as the home of that champion
of champions, "Little Jack," a pony just 12 hands high, owned by J. Delaney,
who at that timet conducted Tyrone. This amazing pony carried all before
it at meetings at Richmond, Fitzroy and Ascot. "Little Jack" was said to
have been untrained, and had been known to carry a weight of over 13
stone in at least one of his victories.
The Tyrone was also the meeting place of many coursing enthusiasts, and
its nearby paddocks have been the scene of many exciting dog races. It
also reached fame when the Camberwell Cup was conducted on land
nearby known as the Camberwell racecourse, in approximately 1889. Many
prominent horses of the day competed in this spectacular local event.
Now the Tyrone Hotel is no more—
just a memory of the grand old days
when it meant so much to sport,
sportsmen and comradeship. The
new Regal Theatre, with its most
modern architecture, comfort, and ser-
vice, is a shining example of the pro-
gress which has been sweeping over
this district for many years—let time
march on, for it brings with it added
lustre to the localities so gallantly
pioneered by our ancestors.


As "Lost Horizon," the Columbia picture from
which this illustration is taken, represents the
heights to which the motion picture art has
arisen, so does the Regal Theatre, Hartwell,
represent the very zenith of comfort and
luxury services.
Congratulations to the proprietors of the
Regal for giving Australia in general, and
Hartwell in particular, one of the finest palaces
of entertainment in existence!
