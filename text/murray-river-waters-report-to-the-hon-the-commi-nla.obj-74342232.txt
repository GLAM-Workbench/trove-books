MURRAY RIVER
ATERS.
PRECIS OF REPORT.
1. Proposals have been, from time to time, advanced for the construction of navigation works on the
Murray River, and the consideration of these forms one of the leading subjects dealt with in the report. In
opposition to the claims herein of this State, it has been alleged that the further extension of works of this
class, especially in the United States of America, has practically ceased. But, that there is little warrant
for the allegation appears from the fact that works, for the canalisation of the Ohio River, in Pennsylvania,
have just been completed, rendering that river navigable for a length of 967 miles; whilst a system for the
canalisation of the great Kanawha River, in West Virginia, is also in progress.
2. By the report, a system of navigation works is proposed for the whole of the Murray River, from
Lake Alexandrina to some miles above Wentworth, a total distance of 485 miles; to be eventually extended
as far up as Kchuca, on the main stream, and Hay on the Murrumbidgee. To initiate this project, it is
recommended to carry out the Lake Victoria storage scheme, as put forward by the Royal Commission of
1902. It is shown that the effect of this would be to raise the level of the river, at the eastern boundary of
the State, by two feet, for a period of nearly four months in each year. The cost of that portion of the
works within South Australia is estimated at �483,000. The Lake Victoria works are estimated at �165,000 ;
which latter sum is to be provided, in equal instalments by the three riverine States.
3. The construction of a barrage, as at one time recommended, for the exclusion of sea water from the
lakes at the Murray mouth, is not concurred in by this report; the great loss of water, by evaporation, it
would entail, is held to be a fatal objection. There is proposed, by way of substitute, a barrage across the
arm at the head of Lake Alexandrina, about eight miles below Wellington ; with a condition that a sufficient
supply of water be sent down the river, to maintain freshness within this reduced area. It is clearly shown
that, unless this be done, and the system of locks be carried down to this point, the lower Murray will, as the
result of diversions higher up, become permanently salt. The cost of this work should be borne by the upper
riverine States, which alone will benefit by the diversions.
4. A recommendation is made in favor of a sea level canal, from Goolwa to Victor Harbor, to carry the
river traffic down to the ocean; the estimated cost being about �470,000. But this work is proposed to be
held over pending the development of traffic, which will be provided for meanwhile by the Goolwa to Victor
railway.
5. The reclamation of Lakes Albert and Alexandrina is shown to be quite within the limits of feasibility.
It is not however recommended that this be undertaken at present; but held over to meet a future demand
for land for settlement. It would add nearly 200,000 acres of land, mostly arable, to the area of the State.
6. It is proposed to initiate a system of domestic and general water supply, for those rural districts
where that now available is of inferior quality, or is liable to become deficient in quantity in seasons of
drought. Suggestions also are made for the improvement of the quality of water supplied in provincial
towns.
7. The land about Lake Bonney, where it had been proposed to establish an irrigation settlement, is
deemed specially suitable for the purpose as to a part of the area only. It is however proposed that the lake
site be reserved as a storage, in which to impound water for the irrigation of the lands included in the
?Lake Bonney Scheme,? should these prove suitable under practical test conditions; otherwise for the
service of suitable lands in the valley below.
8, The Parcoola proposed reservoir site is not considered specially adapted for purposes of water storage.
It is not absolutely condemned as unsuitable ; the report is rather to the effect that the facts are not
sufficiently known; but that so far as they are known they are unfavorable. It is possible that further
exploratory survey may place the question in a more favorable light. The paucity of economical water
storages in South Australia seems unquestionable ; there is deficiency of both available holding space,
and facilities for economical construction.
9. If sufficient water storage cannot be secured at reasonable cost, in South Australia, it may be worth
while to consider whether arrangements can be made with the upper States, for a partnership agreement, in
respect of storages to be constructed there.
10. It is shown that South Australia has an unquestionable claim to a supply of water from the
Murray, for the domestic, stock, and general needs of an extensive area of dry farming land ; for the irriga-
tion, to a depth of 24in., of 625,000 acres of culturable land ; and for a sufficient volume to provide for the
navigation of the locked river, and to maintain freshness in the channel as far down as the barrage below
Wellington?a total of 88,530 millions of cubic feet per annum, for all purposes, when the scheme of
canalisation is complete.
11. To meet the recognised difficulty of establishing irrigation, as an integral part of the system of rural
economy of this State, it is proposed that a select number of Australian youths shall be sent, by the
Government, to study the methods and appliances in use, in countries where it is practised, in preference to
introducing immigrants from those countries, to practise irrigation here.

and annual aggregate in cubic feet, which would be required to keep the weirs and locks fully and
permanently efficient; allowing for loss by evaporation and soakage; and allowing also for the
quantity of water required to pass down over the lowest weir and lock to serve (a) the river below
such lowest lock, ( h) the lakes.
7, The question of storages, other than ordinary navigation weirs and locks, over any part of
the river in South Australia.

REPORT


REPORT.
To the Hon. L. O?Loughlin, M.P., Commissioner of Public Works of the State of South Australia.
Sir.?Pursuant to your letter of instructions, I have the honor to present the following report:?
1. The chief purpose of the examination, called for by the Minister?s instructions, may be succinctly
stated as an inquiry into the utilisation of the river (I.) as a highway of trade, and for the transport of goods,
especially of the produce of the lands of the river valley (a) as an open channel, subject to no special
control, ( h ) as a canalised channel, regulated by weirs and locks, and other navigation works; (II.) as an
agent, by the economic application of its waters, for the promotion of agricultural and pastoral settlement,
and for the supply of the domestic wants of the dwellers in the river valley, and the needs of their cattle
depasturing therein. Subsidiary to these are the conservation of existing interests in the lower river,
between Blanchetown and the lakes, and in the lands adjacent thereto; proposed reclamations in the lake
beds, and the possible utilisation of the reclaimed areas as sites for settlement; and the construction of a
sea level canal, or other work, to enable river-borne goods to be carried to ocean-going vessels in furtherance
of foreign commerce.
NAVIGATION.
2. South Australia has, from the initiation of the Murray River traffic, been a strenuous advocate for its
continuance, development, and extension. In this matter her ambitions?possibly her interests?are in a
measure at variance with those of the other Riverine States. For this reason, above all others, it is important
that some understanding should be arrived at, as to the respective State rights in the control of the river
waters. The uncertainty of the effect of decisions on the questions involved ?there being no body of settled
law applicable ?renders it inadvisable, even if it were possible, that they should be considered on a legal basis
only. A principle, however, that must underlie any satisfactory or enduring settlement is thus enunciated
in the report of the River Murray Inter-State Royal Commission, 1902?? The conservation of existing
interests, especially of such as have .grown out of the natural conditions of the country of their birth, and
have remained for a length of time unchallenged, is a fundamental principle of law, no less than of the
public sense of justice and right, among all civilised communities.? It cannot be gainsaid that the navi-
gation of the Murray and its tributaries, from the mouth to Echuca, in Victoria, and to Hay, Balranald, and
Walgett, in New South Wales, has become established by the natural conditions of the case, and has remained
for many years unchallenged. The volume of the traffic in recent years will be best explained by the
following statement, compiled from returns officially supplied by the railway authorities of the several
States :

For the greater part of the time stated the navigation was carried on by vessels of 7ft. draught; for the
remainder by boats of from 3ft. to 4ft. draught. The near agreement of the returns with one another
constitutes some confirmation of their general accuracy. Their consistency with the depth of water in the
navigable channel of the Murray is the best confirmation possible. (See diagram, sheet No. 1, and the
navigation lines thereon.) 3. Turning


3. Turning again briefly to the treatment of the subject of navigation, in the report of the Royal Com-
mission of 1902, the following may be quoted:?? At the Renmark Irrigation Settlement the fruitgrowers
suffer considerable annual loss owing to the river being closed at the time their perishable fruits are ripe.
One of the principal settlers said that, if the river had been navigable in June, which it was not,
about 500 cases of oranges per week would have been sent aw r ay. It was also stated that at the same time
there were from 250 to 300 tons of fruit river-bound at Renmark.? The loss entailed on the Renmark
settlers by the closure of the river navigation, at the period when their perishable fruits are in the most
saleable condition, forms a strong argument in favor of rendering the navigation perennial by the construc-
tion of works for the creation of permanent slack water in the channel. As matters now stand the liability
to have the navigation closed at any time without notice is an ever-growing difficulty; and it is one to remove
which those interested in the river trade cannot too soon devote their best attention and their most strenuous
endeavors. The permanent navigability of the river would be immediately followed by the enlargement and
extension of traffic thereon.
4. In the course of the discussion that has given rise to this inquiry, and of the contention between the
States as to the priority to be accorded to the several competing interests involved, it has been maintained
that the continuance of river navigation is a matter of no public concern ; inasmuch as it is in process of being
superseded by the extension of railways. Against this view may be quoted the following from the article on
?Canals,? by David Stevenson, in the latest edition of the ? Encyclopaedia Britannica?: ? Though all efforts to
improve barge-canals can never bring them to compete with railways in the quick conveyance of passengers,
it is surprising to find in how many places they still command an enormous traffic in goods and minerals.?
In confirmation of the statement contained in the second sub-clause of this quotation, the following may be
cited from an article on the same subject, by Professor Vernon Harcourt, in the 1902 edition of ?Chambers*
Encyclopaedia?:??The enlargement and extension of canals and the improvement of rivers have been
vigorously pursued by the French Government simultaneously with the development of railways ; and a
large proportion of the bulky goods (in the year 1882 amounting to 1,384 millions of ton miles) are con-
veyed by water in France. There are about 3,000 miles of canals in France, and 2,000 miles of canalised
rivers, in addition to nearly 2,000 miles of open river navigation; and many of the waterways are free of
toll, the costs of construction, improvement, and maintenance being paid by the State. To obtain
uniformity in the principal canals, constructed at different times and under varying conditions, a law was
passed in 1879 for securing eventually a depth of water of locks 126Jft. long and 17ft. wide, and a
clear height of 12ft. under the bridges, along the main lines of traffic. As soon as the necessary works are
completed boats of 300 tons burthen will be able to traverse all the principal waterways of France.? It
may be added that there are to-day 3,000 miles of canals and 4,600 miles of canalised rivers, in addition to
the length of open river navigation mentioned above, in existence in France.
5. In Great Britain the case is otherwise. Of the extensive system of inland waterways in use in that
country at a date not yet distant, many canals are practically wiped out; others are rapidly falling into such
a condition of disrepair as to render them unpopular and almost unusable. The cause is not so much the
preference of the public for other modes of goods transit as the action of wealthy railway corporations in
buying up canal properties and neglecting or altogether closing the works ; cheap water conveyance having
proved a formidable competitor with railway' freight rates. Valuable information on this subject may be
gleaned from a recent paper by Mr. Saner, in the ? Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers.? It
is a fact, and it is due mainly to the closing of lines of cheap water carriage, that steaming coal may be
purchased on the banks of the Nile at a cheaper rate than in the manufacturing towns of the English
Midlands. It would be a calamity that a like state of affairs should arise here through the closure of the
natural trade highway of the Murray basin by the diversion of the river waters. There must be sought a
modus ayendi whereby the small proportion of the river volume required to maintain permanent slack water
in the channel may be provided without injurious interference with paramount public needs. The provision
of a water supply, ample tor the preservation of health and comfort among the dwellers in the river valleys,
for the needs of cattle depasturing therein, and for the promotion of intense forms of agriculture by the
irrigation of suitable soils, is not inconsistent with the preservation of the established river traffic.
6. In the United States of America, where but recently there was great activity in the canalisation of
rivers, the work is at present carried on less vigorously. The chief causes seem to be the lowering of railway 7
freights through the excessive competition of companies, furthered to some extent by the writing down of
capital; and the extensive appropriation of public streams by the promoters of irrigation and land companies.
That it is not entirely suspended is, however, evident from the following extract from the proceedings for the
year 1908, of the American Society of Civil Engineers :?? The recent completion of a series of locks and dams
on the Ohio River creates, with existing improvements, a navigable depth of Oft. between Pittsburg and Beaver,
a distance of 30 miles. The Ohio River is formed at Pittsburg by the junction of the Monongahela and
Allegheny rivers ; its total navigable length is 967 miles, and in the first stretch of the river between Pitts-
burg and Beaver the slope is Isin. per mile. The maximum recorded discharge at Pittsburg is 439,000
cubic feet per second ? ?fully seven times the greatest recorded discharge of the Murray at Morgan?? but
it varies very greatly, necessitating a system of dams with movable tops. There is a large traffic on the
river with barges, which are about 26ft. wide and 175 ft. long. These are made up into batches of about 50
or 60 boats, towed by stern-wheel steamers, which are exceedingly efficient for the work owing to their
manoeuvring capabilities. After a short review of the various schemes which have been proposed fox-
maintaining a navigable channel, the author describes the system of movable dams. The plan ultimately
adopted was that of Major Morrill, which provided for 13 locks and dams between Pittsburg and Wheeling,
for a minimum depth of 6ft., the dams to be of the movable type with navigable passes 400 ft. wide, to be
closed with Chanoine wickets and high and low weirs; also for high and low w-eirs, to be closed with either
Desfontaine wickets or Brunot gates. The lift of the dams planned has been limited to about Bft. as a
maximum, which was based on the experience of French engineers. The wickets used in the Chanoine
dams are 3ft. 9in. wide and are spaced 4ft., thus allowing Sin. spaces between them. When the discharge
of the river is very small, wooden needles are used to cover the spaces between the wickets.?
7. As


7. As basis from which to discuss the proposed reconciliation of the interests of trade and navigation,
on the one hand, with those of agricultural production and settlement, on the other, the first requirement is
a clear and explicit statement of the ascertained volume of the river, and of the dimensions, capacity, and
condition of its channel. The discharges of the Murray, set out in tables 1., 11., 111., and IV., accompanying
this report, are at Mildura, at the eastern boundary of South Australia, and at Morgan?at Mildura, the
lowest point on the river within the State of Victoria at which discharges have been gauged, special
reference also being made to it in the instructions issued for guidance in this inquiry ; at the eastern boundary of
South Australia, because the volume passing there must be a governing condition in any inter-State agree-
ment to which South Australia can become a party; and at Morgan, the lowest point on the river channel at
which there are continuous gaugings.
8. The first three tables give the average volume of water flowing in the river channel for each month
of each of the 23 years, 1886 to 1908 inclusive, at the points mentioned. Table I. gives the average in
cubic feet per minute, for each month, of the actual measured volumes of the stream, and is exclusive of that
pumped or otherwise withdrawn from the river for use at the settlement; the total for the month in millions
of cubic feet, the larger unit being here adopted chiefly to facilitate condensation of the figures ; and the mean
depth on the navigable channel bed, or, more strictly, the depth on the channel bed due to the mean volume of
flow. That the actual volume varies from day to day, and even from hour to hour, is unquestionably true ;
but experience shows that, for the practical purpose of a statement for discussion, the mean for the month is
more convenient and more readily apprehended than would be the daily or any less volume. The labor
involved in the more elaborate statement would also be 30 times greater; which consideration alone puts it
out of the question. What is meant by the depth on the navigable channel bed will be explained further on.
Table 111. relates to Morgan. For reasons that will presently appear it is necessary to deal with it before Table
11. It also gives theaverage in cubic feetper minute,for each month, of theactual measured volume of the stream;
the total for the month in millions of cubic feet: and the depth on the navigable channel bed due to the mean
volume of flow. Table 11. relates to the volume flowing in the river channel at the point where it crosses
the eastern boundary of South Australia. The figures in this case are the result, not of measurement, but of
computation. There are no actual gaugings at this point nor any fixed gauge staff nearer than at Renmark,
some 50 miles lower down the river; it is necessary therefore to explain how the computations were made. In
his evidence before the Inter-State Commission, at page 141 of the published minutes, Mr. Ettore Checchi is
reported as follows:?? Q. 3858. You had to ignore the Murrumbidgee, the Wakool, and the Darling?
Yes; I computed the flow. As an instance 1 may say that the quantity recorded as passing the Murrum-
bidgee at Hay, and the Murray at Echuca, is in some cases less than the quantity given as passing Mildura,
which is impossible. * * ? Q,. 3859. How do you explain the discrepancy ??Either the Mildura, Morgan,
or Darling gaugings are incorrect. I took the Mildura gaugings personally, and consider them reliable. The
gaugings at Morgan appear to be correct. Morgan is a good place to take gaugings at, whereas I do not
think Wilcannia is. Again, in time of flood an officer cannot reach Wilcannia from Sydney within a week,
and by that time the flood may have subsided.? Mr. Checchi gave a tabular statement of the discharges of the
Darling, as computed by him, for the whole of each of the years 1887 to 1901 inclusive. These were
accepted by the Commission, and have been here adopted. The Mildura discharges were reduced by a
coefficient having a value equal to three-fourths of that derived from the experience of losses in the upper
river, to make them representative of the volumes reaching the Darling junction. To these were added the
Darling discharges, as above explained, and the sums equated to those at Morgan, to determine the coefficient
expressing their relation. This was found to be practically identical with that denoting the proportion of
losses to total volume in transit, as derived from the gaugings above. To complete the table, the volumes
at the boundary for the years 1886 and 1902-1908 were then obtained by applying this coefficient to the
recorded Morgan discharges for these years, with the proper correction for the actual length of channel from
Morgan to the boundary. The method adopted for determining the discharge of the river at Mildura and
Morgan, the points where the actual measurements have been made, is based upon that described in
? Hydraulics of Great Rivers,? by J. J. Revy, London, 1874; and employed by the author in the determina-
tion of the volume of the LaPlata. It is given in some detail in the ? River Gaugings ? compilation, 1905,
issued by the Victorian State Government.
9. The volumes expressed by the figures tabulated are also represented graphically in the drawing, sheet
No. 1. To enable a clear idea to be readily formed of their signification,lines have been drawn on the diagram
indicative of the level of water surface at each of the three points dealt with ; the levels represented being those
due respectively to a depth of 6ft. 6in. and of 4ft. on the navigable channel bed. The greater depth is that
required to permit of barges of sft. draught being towed with no greater effort than in open water; the less
is just sufficient to enable barges drawing 3ft. 6in. to be towed, but with greater exertion of force than would
be necessary if there were wider clearance beneath.
10. By the term ?navigable channel bed? is intended a plane, everywhere parallel to the surface slope
of the river when carrying a navigable depth of water. This assumed plane is Ift. 9in. below the zero of
the gauge at Morgan (as might be gathered from the figures in Table HI.); and if 6ft. 6in. of depth, or 4ft.
9in. on the Morgan gauge, be taken as the full navigable depth ?which it would be for barges drawing sft.
this depth is necessary to provide Ift. 6in. clearance over the shallow at Hart?s Island. The island is about 44
miles above Morgan, and the shallow extends intermittently fora length of about B,6ooyds. There are other
shallows between Morgan and the eastern boundary; but this one has the least depth of water, and is
therefore the governing point. The volume due to this depth, 4ft. 9in. on the gauge, or 6ft. (fin, on the
navigable channel bed at Morgan, is 390,000 cub. ft. per minute, there. The equivalent at the eastern
boundary is 428,950 cub. ft. per minute ; the navigable channel bed has therefore been taken as 6ft. 6in.
below the surface level of water, when the volume flowing there is 428,950 cub. ft. per minute. At Mil-
dura, the navigable channel bed is about 2ft. 9in. below zero of the gauge ; and the volume due to 3ft. 9in.
on gauge, or 6ft. 6in. depth of water, is 274,000 cub. ft. per minute. These depths have been verified as far
as possible by soundings. It should be pointed out here that in an agreement tentatively arrived at between
the Premiers of the Riverine States, but not ratified, 365,000 cub. ft. per minute is provided by clause 30
as the volume, under certain conditions, to be passed on to the South Australian boundary. This is the
equivalent


equivalent of about 331,900 cub. ft. per minute at Morgan, and would provide a depth of 3ft. llin. on
the gauge, or sft. Sin. on the navigable channel bed, at the latter point; and a clearance of Sin. only for
boats of sft. draught over the shallow at Hart?s Island.
11. The settled rule for the depth and cross-sectional area of canals, and therefore with certain limita-
tions of the channels of canalised rivers, is thus stated in well-known engineering textbooks:?? The
depth of water and sectional area of waterway should be such as not to cause any material increase of the
resistance to the motion of the boat, beyond what it would encounter in open water. The following are the
general rules which fulfil these conditions Least breadth at bottom equal to twice greatest breadth of a
boat. Least depth of water, 18in. more than the greatest draught of a boat. Least area of waterway, six
times the greatest mid-ship section of a boat.? ?? Rankine?s Civil Engineering,? part 111., cap. iii. Again
(this is from ? Law and Burnell?s Civil Engineering,? edition 1881, page 172) ??That there should be no-
material augmentation of the resistance of a boat, beyond the normal resistance in open water, the breadth
at the bottom should be at least twice the greatest breadth of the boat; the depth should be at least 1 Sin-
more than the draught; and the sectional area of waterway should be at least six times the greatest mid-
ship section of the boat.? The rule given by Professor Rankine is also quoted with approval in ? Canal and
River Engineering,? David Stevenson, 1872.
12. Reference to the relation between the draught of boats and the depth of water in the channel that
is to carry them seems called for by the provisions of clause 33 of the Bill drafted in connection with the-
tentative agreement before referred to. In that clause the chief consideration to be observed in the
canalisation of the river is that it shall provide for navigability by vessels drawing not more than sft. of
water. To discuss any 7 scheme of canalisation some limit of navigability must be assumed, and it seems-
reasonable to take that adopted by common consent in past negotiations. On the principle laid down in the
passages cited, the upper of the two navigation lines, shown in sheet No. 1, gives the depth and volume
required for free navigation by vessels drawing sft.; the lower that for restricted navigation by barges of
3ft. Gin. draught. But these depths and volumes relate to an open, not to a canalised, river; and the
difference in conditions implied must not be lost sight of. In an open river there is a current of greater or
less swiftness; and generally, for the same river, varying with the volume of flow. In a canal, or in a
canalised river, when the conditions are such that vessels travel in the slack water created by the weirs,
there is practically no current. The resistance to the movement of vessels up stream is greater in the first
case than in the second; though of course less for vessels going down stream. Professor Rankine
thus states the rule for computing the increase of resistance due to current ?? The effect of the current
of the stream, on the load that may be drawn by a force of haulage equal to about three miles per
hour, may be roughly estimated as follows ;?Load drawn against current equal to load in still water
multiplied by J v being the velocity of the current in feet per second.??? Civil Engineering,?
Part 111., sec. iii. Computed by 7 this rule the load that may be drawn in still water is to that against a
current of one mile per hour as l:U - 504 ; that is to say, the still water load is almost double of that against
a current of one mile per hour for the same force of draught. Against a current of three miles per hour
the load, as compared with that in still water, is as 0?203;1 ; that is to say, the still water load is nearly 7 five
times what may be drawn against a three-mile current by the same force.
13. The Murray, in its present condition as an open river, like most streams of slight fall in country-
distant from the sea, is exceedingly tortuous. In general the deep channel followed by boats plying on the
river avoids projecting points and the side on which the land is salient at bends, keeping well clear of them,
even where to do so involves a considerable detour. Having passed a projection, the channel makes for the
concave bank, at a point from one to two and a half times the width of the alveus of the ordinary river, below
the cape. Thence it keeps near the hollow side ; or, if the reach in front be long and straight, follows almost
the centre line of the stream until the current begins to be influenced by the neighborhood of another bend
or projection. Personal observation is confirmed by inspection of the charts?hand-made?used by the river
pilots. It agrees also with the following by David Stevenson ;?? Viewed as a purely abstract question, it may-
be safely affirmed that a stream is most likely- to follow a permanent course when directed by a concave wall.
Dr. Voung observes that the centrifugal force has a tendency to draw the greater portion of the water to
the concave side ; and thus the greatest scouring power, and consequently the greatest depth, of the stream
will be found upon that side.? ?? Canal and River Engineering,? 1872 edition.
14. While the river remains open it would be desirable, in the interests of trade, that in years of low river,
navigation should be protracted, and the periods of closure reduced, as much as reasonably possible. In the
report of the Inter-State Commission, 1902, attention is drawn to the feasibility of compassing this object
by the execution of the Lake Victoria regulation-storage scheme. This lake is in the State of New South
Wales, within three miles of the river bank, and about 35 miles in a direct line below the junction of the
Darling. ?It covers an area of about 30,000 acres, and is connected with the main stream by- the Rufus
River, through which it is fed when the Murray is high. The level of water permanently impounded by
the bar is R.L. 73-00 fi.e., 73ft. above the water conservation datum adopted in New South Wales), whereas
flood marks show that the lake has been filled to R.L. 90-00, the storage between the two levels being 17,000
millions of cubic feet. In order that full advantage might be taken of such floods, the lake could be filled bv
raising the river level below Frenchman?s Creek and diverting through it to Lake Victoria. Itis estimated that
a weir on the river would cost �BO,OOO, and the improvement of Frenchman?s Creek and the erection of
embankments and regulators �4,800, or a total of �84,800. These works would make possible the storage
of 22,399 millions of cubic feet, a volume which, while allowing for evaporation at the rate of GOin. per
annum, would provide in times of low river 100,000 cub. ft. per minute for a period of nearly four
months.? Clause 22 of the tentative agreement already referred to provides for the construction of this
storage with two locks on the river. Although one lock only?the upper?would be essential if the river
were to remain open, it will be better if the proposal to construct works for the provision of slack water
during times of low river is adopted to take both in hand at once. The cost would in that case be �16f,800
instead of �84,800. The full navigation depth with an open river, referred to in clause 10 of this report,

will demand a flow of 428,950 cub. ft. per minute at the eastern boundary of the State ; the restricted
depth for boats of 3ft. 6in. draught, with 6in. clearance only, 313,900 at the same point; while an addition
of 100,000 cub. ft. per minute to the volume of the stream would raise the level of the surface by almost
exactly 2ft., for all depths within the navigation limits. It would be superfluous to dwell upon the advantage
that would accrue from the provision in a dry season of this volume from Lake Victoria.
15. At an inspection in October, 1909, the approximate discharge from the Murray into French-
man?s Creek was 90,000 cub. ft. per minute. The site adopted as that of a weir to regulate diversion into
the creek is about a mile low 7 er down than the principal natural offtake. For the control of diversions it is
suitable; while from the constructional point of view, all that could be said In the high-level condition
of the river is, that no serious difficulties are apparent. At the junction of the Rufus Creek?the outlet from
Lake Victoria?with the Murray, there was a discharge of about 90,000 cub. ft. per minute into the river ;
the lake being full to the level of the natural bar. Mr. Armstrong, the manager of the Lake Victoria
Station, says, however, that with a rising river the inflow to the lake generally begins through the Rufus.
From the designs prepared by the New' South Wales Public Works Department the following leading
particulars are taken of this proposed storage ;
16. The permanent navigability of the Murray may be provided for by the construction of a series of works
for the creation of slack w-ater in the river channel, see diagrams, sheet No. 2. The work shown?sheets
Nos. 3 and 4?consists of a movable weir and lock. The lock chamber would be 150 ft. by 45ft. in clear, with
16ft. depth of water on the floor, and a further sft. to the cope; the lift of each lock being 10ft., except
those connected with the Lake Victoria works, which would have a lift of 14ft. The lower 6ft. of depth,
reduced to sft. 6in. over the entrance and exit sills, represents the navigable depth at the head of the pool
below. The proposed lock chambers are large enough to accommodate the boats and barges at present trading
on the river. Eventually, with a view to economy of water, they should be reduced to 130 ft. by 26ft.,
sufficient for the passage of barges of at least 260 tons burthen ; which might be towed, either singly or in
file, by stern-wheel or by screw'-propeller tug-boats. The remaining width of the channel is shown as closed
by a movable weir, framed of timber wickets; adjustable from a gangway, carried on iron trestles hinged to
the bed by suitable gudgeons, so that they may be folded down flat during the periods of open river; the one
next the abutment being housed in a chamber contrived for the purpose. The abutments, lock chamber,
and platform or bed of the weir would be of cement concrete; reinforced where necessary with bars of mild
?steel. As a matter of fact however this design must be understood as subject to modification. The greater
part of the river will, in general, be closed by a movable weir lower than that shown ; that is to say, with its
bed or platform higher than, but its crest at the same level as, that shown in the diagram; the high weir
being restricted to the pass, to be used when the volume of water is sufficient for open river navigation. The
pass would occupy the space next to the lock, and should be about 160 ft. in the clear ; the low weir,
separated from it by a pier of solid masonry, would be of similar design to that in the pass. The sectional
?area of the waterway, when these movable weirs are down, should be as near the natural section as possible ;
in no case must the natural section be reduced to cause sensible heading. The cost of a work, in accordance
with the proposed modified design, will not materially differ from that shown. Any difference there mav be
will probably be in the direction of reduction. The drawings?-sheets Nos. 3 and 4?are to be understood as
type drawings only. It is impossible to give actual drawings of any particular work, in the absence of a
?detailed survey of its site and of pittings or borings of the ground in the river bed and banks. In the
'selection of weir sites, it is hardly necessary to remark, the presence of rock at or near the surface will
oe an advantage, but is not an indispensable condition. They are to be preferred in a reach of some
length, where the channel is well defined and not too much curved, and the lock and pass should never be in
the convex side nor near a projecting headland. That they should be in the concave side, where the reach is
sensibly curved, will be readily understood from the concluding sentence of clause 13.
17. The movable weirs shown in these diagrams are of the type known as the Chanoine. They have
been designed, chiefly, on the model of the improvement works of the great Kanawha River, in West
Virginia; a copy of the working drawings for which has been rendered available by the courtesy of the
?officers of the Bureau of Public Works at Washington. The general design adopted for the improvements of
the Ohio River, referred to in clause 6, is of similar type ; with proposals for others of the Desfontaine or of
the Brunot pattern. The Chanoine type of river navigation works is that now most favored; not only in
France, where it was introduced, but also in America and elsewhere. Another type, at present in general
use, and likely to prove suitable for the Murray River, is the needle weir. It has the advantage of being
'capable of easy manipulation, by one man unassisted; but against this has to be considered the great
expenditure of time involved in raising or lowering it, when the river has to be regulated. The Chanoine
weir, on the other hand, is open to the objection that the wide openings between the wickets, necessary to
secure convenient working, entails a loss of water that would prove serious during low river. But this
difficulty may be got over by the use of suitable needles, formed with a tongue and cover to close the spaces.
As there are almost no river navigation works in existence in the Commonwealth, and few officers here who
have had practical experience in their design and construction, it will be advisable that the engineer to be
entrusted with the preparation of the drawings for the Murray River works, should pay a visit of inspection
to several of the canalised rivers of America and of the Continent of Europe, before entering on his duties.
Besides the rivers mentioned above, excellent and informative examples are to be seen on the Seine, the
liOire, and thedaronne; easily accessible at all times, and where a visitor may study at leisure both the design
and the mode of manipulation. 18, In


18. In the report of the Inter-State Commission the cost of a typical weir and lock is given as �lOO,OOO,
and of the necessary works from Blanchetown to the eastern boundary of the State as �600,000. The New
South Wales estimate for a weir at the offtake of Frenchman?s Creek, in connection with the Lake Victoria
scheme, is �BO.OOO ; but that is for a work with a lilt of 14ft. A weir in accordance with the type drawings
accompanying this report, the lock having a lift of 10ft., should be constructed for about �73,738 ; and this
estimate includes a fair allowance for risks and for probable loss by river floods. This should not materially
differ from the cost of a work such as above described, with separate weirs, in the pass and waste
channel. The cost of the system from Swan Reach to the border would then stand at �482,428. But no
estimates can be taken as other than approximations, until after detailed surveys and other exploratory work
on a scale of minuteness greater than any now available. The most that can meanwhile be predicated is
that the cost will in all probability range between �482,428 and �600,000. See Appendix V.
19. The loss of water in the river channel due to the maintenance of navigation will be best appre-
hended by considering it as a fraction of the volume at Morgan, the lowest point of gaugings. Table IV. is.
a summary of the totals for each of the 23 years dealt with in Tables 1., 11., and 111., the Morgan volumes
being given in the last column; and it should be noted that these are the actual volumes that came down the
river, and are exclusive of all diversions and all losses, whether from natural or artificial causes. In the
minimum year (1902) the Morgan volume was 93,274 millions of cubic feet; that for 1901, the next lowest*
being more than two and a half times as great. There is reason to believe that 1902 was an abnormal year
throughout the Murray basin. The Victorian gaugings at Mildura extend back to 1865 ; those at Albury to
1877 ; and at Murchison, on the Goulbourn, one of the greater tributaries of the Murray, to 1882. In 1902
the total Mildura discharge w'as 57,517 millions of cubic feet; in 1868, the next lowest year, it was
196,445, and in 1884 it was 200,747 millions. At Albury in 19<i2 the total was 39,381 million cubic feet*
and in 1884, the next lowest within the period of the records, 78,697 millions. At Murchison in 1902 the
total was 27,753 million cubic feet; and in 1884, the next lowest recorded there, 50,963 millions. It is.
evident that the discharge of the Murray in the year 1902 was the lowest during the past 45 years, and less
than half that of the next lowest year; and therefore that it ought not to he considered in any analysis of
the gaugings with a view to the utilisation of the river waters. Excluding this minimum year, the volumes
at Morgan recorded in Table IV., are divisible into three groups, which may properly be characterised as low*
mean, and high years. Of low years, those in which the total discharge at Morgan has been less than
400,000 millions of cubic feet, there have been ten; and the average total per year has been 299,102"
millions; of mean years, from 400,000 to 600,000 millions, there have been five; and their average
discharge at Morgan 468,335 millions; while of high years, wherein the Morgan total has been over 600,000*
millions, there have been seven ; and their average discharge 818,844 millions of cubic feet. The length of
the river channel from the mouth at Wellington to the State boundary is 356 miles, and the average width
of the wetted surface when locked will be about 10 chains. Allowing for an annual loss by evaporation of
60ins., and by soakage at the rate of �in. per day over the wetted surface, the total from these causes would be
15,500 millions of cubic feet for a year. The average annual loss by lockage, allowing for ten lockings per-
day, would be under 250 millions of cubic feet, so that the total losses by evaporation, soakage, and lockage
would be about 15,750 millions of cubic feet per annum. Of this, half of the evaporation and soakage
would be inevitable in most years apart from locking, and a portion of the lockage might properly be con-
sidered as compensation water. On the whole, the loss properly debitable to the adoption of slack-water
navigation works will not exceed 8,000 millions of cubic feet per annum. The result may be put in tabular-
form thus?

sive of losses - 3 x f .

But the minimum volume required throughout the year at the boundary, to provide for continuous navi-
gation, will evidently be 15,750,000,000 -j- 525,600 = very nearly 30,000 cub. ft. per minute, about
-A?-, and - 6 1 2 - of the respective annual volumes, which will therefore be the irreducible minimum required to
pass the boundary to provide for navigation. On the like basis, the losses debitable to navigation, for evapora-
tion, soakage, and lockage on the Murray, from the S A. boundary to Echuca, and on the Murrumbidgee,
from the junction with the Murray to Hay, would be about 14,000 millions of cubic feet per annum. But,
inasmuch as these losses are from the upper rivers, and therefore from volumes that do not undergo the
diminution due to following the lower river channel for an average distance of 615 miles, to Morgan, the l
actual loss debitable to these causes would be reduced by more than one-fourth; and 14,000 millions becomes
10.500 millions. The total annual loss of water debitable to the entire system of navigation works would
thus range from-rg" in a low year to-Ar in a high year, of the volume at Morgan; although the quantity
actually used, measured at the points of offtake, will range between A 0 and A - of that volume. No account
is here taken of losses from the Darling; it being understood that there is no present intention to extend
the navigation works to that river.
20. The river valley from the east boundary of the State down to Swan Reach, near which is the site-
of the lowest of the proposed navigation weirs and locks, is throughout much of its length bounded by cliffs
of imperfectly consolidated, impure limestone, frequently close to the river channel, sometimes on one side,
sometimes on the other. From this point the cliffs are less frequent; the valley gradually opens out, showing
wide flats, backed by hills of gentle slope, well grassed or under cultivation; the limestone, however,
continuing as the surface rock. A little below Swan Reach, it is stated, the depth to the limestone bed is
augmented; but there is no visible indication of the point at which this occurs. The depth in the channel
increases, so that there is ample water for such boats as could clear the locks. About 14 miles below Swan
Reach a sounding was tried, but at 38ft, the lead did not touch bottom. Again, a sounding was tried in the
bend above Teal Flat, about 17 miles above Mannum, with a like result. Thence through Lake Alexandfina
and the channel to Goolwa deep water continues. Opposite Poltallock the depth as shown by several
soundings is uniformly 13ft. Abreast of the mouth of the Finniss River it ranges from 17ft. to, 18ft., while


Goolwa wharf it is over 30ft. From Goolwa the channel continues southward about miles; thence it
turns eastward about 6 miles to the sea mouth, where the waters of the Murray find exit. Throughout the
latter distance the ocean is separated from the channel, which is in fact a continuation of the lakes and is
here from one-quarter to three-quarters of a mile wide, by a line of sand dunes nowhere exceeding a half
mile in width. At several points on this spit there are apparent evidences of recent breaches by the sea.
The mouth or opening is at present about 600 ft. or 800 ft. wide, mostly with an apparent depth of no more
than 3ft. The exception is a deeper channel of a width of 200 ft. or 300 ft. A sounding was obtained in the
channel within the sandhills, near the mouth; the depth of water there was Bft.; the tide being near springs
and about half flood. From the eastern side of the entrance the sand dunes continue eastward.
21. So far there is no question about the easy and convenient transport of river-borne cargoes; but we
are now face to face with the problem of their transference to ocean-going vessels. Two solutions have been
proposed?one by enlarging the opening, or by cutting a new opening through the sandhills, to enable ships
from oversea to come inside and take loading from the barges; the other to cut a sea-level canal from the
inland water near Goolwa to the sea at Victor Harbor. The first of these proposals has been advocated by
Mr. Thos. Walker Fowler, M. Inst. C.E., in a paper published in the transactions of the Victorian Institute
of Engineers. Of the second a survey and estimate have been made under the direction of Mr. A. B,
Moncrieff, M. Inst. C.E., Railways Commissioner, and formerly Engineer-in-Chief of this State; and
an estimate by Mr. Lindon Bates.
22. The Murray Mouth canal proposal will, perhaps, be best understood by reference to Mr. Fowler?s
paper. He says?? Sir John Coode seems to have estimated the cost of opening thb Murray Mouth for
seagoing vessels at �2,000,000, and even at that figure does not seem to have been sanguine of success:
whilst Mr. Lindon Bates advocated the Goolwa to Victor Harbor canal, at an estimated cost of �571,000.
Mr. A. B. Moncrieff, then Engineer-in-Chief of South Australia, on going over Mr. Bates?s estimate, apparently
considers that the work could be carried out for �473,000.? And again??lt is of course impossible, from the
available data, to form any reliable opinion as to the probable cost of the works here advocated; but when it is
remembered that the Gippsland Lakes were .successfully opened up for �126,000, it seems probable that
similar works might be successfully carried out at the Murray Mouth for a sum less than that estimated as
the cost of the Victor Harbor canal. In this connection an important point would be the amount of protec-
tion necessary for shipping at the entrance. To make the entrance accessible in all weathers, probably a
breakwater would be required in addition to the training walls; but as Victor Harbor would always be
available as a harbor of refuge, where vessels could obtain protection during rough weather, the construction
of such a breakwater might be safely postponed until the trade had developed sufficiently to justify the
necessary expenditure.? Mr. Fowler?s view is sanguine. The opening of the Gippsland Lakes entrance
cannot be said to furnish a precedent of weight in the solution of this question. Neither the degree of pro-
tection there, nor probably the width, would be held sufficient by owners of vessels of the class likely to be
employed in the carriage of Australian produce to the markets of Europe. The width of the Gippsland
Lakes entrance is 250 ft.; that proposed by Mr. Fowler himself for the Murray Mouth is I,oooft. More-
over, it is a fact that in rough southerly weather masters of vessels in shelter inside the lakes, with cargo on
board, have lain up for days rather than face the risks of getting out into open water. It has also happened
that vessels from Melbourne or other Victorian ports have in like circumstances, after cruising for a length of
time outside the entrance, put back to their port of departure. The wreck of vessels in attempting to pass in
?or out of the entrance in unfavorable weather is also not unknown. Mr. Fowler makes no reference to the
necessity for a harbor where large vessels can lie inside the Murray 7 Mouth entrance. Such a basin is
obviously an indispensable part of any scheme on the lines of Mr. Fowler?s project. It would have to be
large enough to permit of swinging vessels not less than 400 ft. in length, with a depth of at least 25ft. of
water.
23. The line of the proposed canal to Victor Harbor, as surveyed under the direction of Mr, Moncrieff
for the purpose of an estimate, leaves the inland water about a mile south of Goolwa. As roughly designed
the bed would be 7ft. below low-water level of spring tides; bed width, 50ft.; slopes in the lower 15ft.
-of depth, 2:1, above that such as the nature of the ground may warrant. From the mouth to the crossing of
the road forming the north-west boundary of allotment 2360 the soil is a light loam, generally sandy on the
?surface, with a tendency to become clayey 7 from the subsoil down to the level of the canal bed. It is clear
of the sandhills, except for a short distance where it crosses the slope of a detached dune. From the road
crossing it continues clear of the sandhills to about 2 miles 15 chains, where it enters a lagoon, the water in
which is at present about 7ft. above sea level. This has apparently been formed by a watercourse, now almost
obliterated, cut through many years ago, according to local tradition, by a mass of sand carried in by storm
action from the sea. The canal follows the lagoon for a distance of about 50 chains, the lagoon bed being
about 3ft. above sea. The cutting would thus drain the greater part of the lagoon, reclaiming an area of
probably about 70 acres. From where the line emerges from the lagoon, to about 3 miles 33 chains, it follows
ground similar in character to that near the Goolwa Mouth; the maximum depth of cutting being about 17
?or 18ft. At about 3 miles 37 chains it crosses a ridge, the surface level at apex being such as to entail 38ft.
total depth of cutting. Thence it finds its way to near the sea beach at about 4 miles, and follows as close
as possible to the foot of and inside the sandhills, which here are low, to about 6 miles. In the section
between 4 and 6 miles, these low sandhills form the sole protection of the canal against possible inroads from
the sea ; so that it may become necessary to construct some defensive works on their seaward face to prevent
them being breached in severe south-west gales. From 6 miles the line turns more directly to the west
-and cuts across the neck of the peninsula on which Port Elliot stands. The site of the town appears to be
limestone, overlying granite; but at what depth the contact occurs on the crossing of the canal line it is
impossible, in the absence of borings, to form an opinion. The depth from surface to canal bed at the
-highest point of crossing the bluff is 84ft.?inadvertently referred to by Mr. Fowler as the height above sea
level. Thence the line follows across cultivated fields to 7 miles 50 chains, where the total depth of cutting
is only 17ft. 6in. Again it keeps along the coast, at times inside the railway line, at times taking up the
?existing site of the railway track, down to Havborough. In this section the railway is, and the canal would

in rough southerly weather. The deep cutting (61ft.) near Hayborough is entailed by the necessity to cut
back into the sand cliff clear of the railway line. Mr. Fowler refers to the canal line, after passing the high
ground at Port Elliot, as entering a valley draining to the Hindmarsh Creek. The valley referred to does
not drain into the Hindmarsh, Its waters are discharged directly into the sea by a culvert in reinforced
concrete under the railway line at about 7J miles. It is separated from the Hindmarsh Valley by a saddle*
to cross which would entail a cutting, probably not less than three quarters of a mile long, and reaching at,
the crown to a depth of over 50ft. A distance of 12 chains after leaving the Hayborough cutting carries the
canal into the channel of the Hindmarsh River, which it approximately follows a further distance of 16
chains to the sea. The total length of the canal line from the mouth near Goolwa to the termination in the
open water of Victor Harbor is 9f miles. As to the line surveyed, it has evidently been located with care
and skill. The low-water level of spring tides at the canal entrance is identical with that of gravity sur-
face of water in the lakes; a tide lock will therefore be required at the Victor Harbor mouth of the canal.
The cost of such a work, there, should not exceed �15,000.
24. It will be understood that the design is for a sea-level canal, and the question at once arises?Why
not a locked canal, seeing that the cost of the cutting would in that case be so much less ? The answer lies,
on the surface. A canal following the rise and fall of the country would have to be filled by pumping,
there being no side streams of any use on the high land adjacent. The whole supply would have to
be pumped from the sea at or near Port Elliot, and the continuous cost of raising water and working the
locks would be too heavy a handicap. Besides, if to the cost of cutting the canal there be added that of
building the locks the saving in construction would not be great. The estimate of �515,000, given by the
Public Works Department, has been examined in the light of facts learned by personal inspection, the
amount seems high. The leading items are?
For amended estimate, �455,730, see Appendix VI. But to this will have to be added an indefinite sum
for protective works at certain points on the seaward face of the dunes, lying between the canal and the ocean,
beach.
25. Victor Harbor consists of a partly natural, partly artificial bay, sheltered from seaward winds, and
especially from the south-west, by the land on which the town stands and by the higher land behind it; by
the continuation of the coast southward to Wright Island and the promontory and high bluff of Rosetta
Head; by Granite Island, with its eastward extension of I,oooft. by a breakwater of granite
blocks; and by Seal Island. The protection fully covers the mouth of the Hindmarsh River and the
debouchement of the proposed canal. The harbor has at present one timber pile jetty 300 ft, in
length. The depth of water at the jetty is 18ft, at the landward and 25ft. at the seaward end at low-water
springs. There are also moorings for vessels in the deep water. The sheltered area includes between 250-
and 300 acres of not less than 25ft. minimum depth, and is capable of indefinite extension by the lengthen-
ing of the breakwmter and jetty. The bottom in the deep water is reported by the local acting harbormaster
to be of limestone and mud. Granite Island is connected from its western end by a timber gangway of
about 2,400 ft. to the mainland at the town.
26. On a review of the foregoing, the extent to which the river would be drawn upon to provide water
for the maintenance of permanent navigation appears the most important question concerning the other
States. This is dealt with in clause 19. In a year of low river discharge, it would be one-thirty-seventh of
the total volume for the year at Morgan ; in a mean year, one-fifty-eighth of that total; and in a high year*
one-one hundred and second part thereof. In the year 1902, that of the lowest discharge of the Murray
during the past 45 years, it would have been dne-eleventh of the Morgan discharge. But the conditions of-'
that year were so phenomenal that, were the like to recur, the use of the river water would for the time be-
restricted by common consent to domestic and sanitary purposes and the preservation of valuable stock and
of profitable permanent plantations. The cost of the river navigation works in South Australia would be-
within �600,000, of those necessary to carry the traffic to the sea within �515,000, while some reduction of
the first of these amounts might be hoped for. No close or reliable estimates of these projects is possible-
until some general scheme is adopted and the sites of the principal works are decided on, carefully surveyed*
and the ground properly explored. A detailed survey of the river channel, from the eastern boundary of
South Australia to Swan Reach, including all the ana-branches, billabongs and lagoons, within the space
bounded by the cliffs, has been recently carried out by the Engineer-in-Chief?s branch of the State Public
Works Department. The plotting of the work is approaching completion. It should prove of the greatest
service in the selection of sites for locks and other navigation works. Time will be required to carry these out
and to develop the river trade. Meanwhile the traffic from Goolwa to Victor Harbor may be accommodated*
at a somewhat increased rate, by the existing railway. The first works to be put in hand are those of the Lake
Victoria storage and regulation. This item of the general scheme, useful in connection with a locked river*
would be even more so while it remains open. The tentative agreement, already referred to in this report*
expressly provides that the Lake Victoria works shall be the first undertaken, that they shall be constructed-
by the State of South Australia, and that the cost of such construction, and the subsequent maintenance,
shall be borne by the three riverine States in equal shares. ?See clauses 22, 28, and 29 of the agreement in
question. The engineer, to be entrusted with the preparation of the drawings for the Murray River works*
should be afforded an opportunity of paying a visit of inspection to. some of the canalised rivers of
Europe and America, before entering on his duties.
IRRIGATION ;


IRRIGATION; AND GENERAL WATER SUPPLY AS AN AID TO THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE RESOURCES OF THE RIVER VALLEY.
27. The subjects of irrigation, and general water supply to the settlers in the rural areas, specially
referred to in paragraphs 9, 10, and 12 of the Minister?s letter of instructions, are so intimately associated
that they will be best considered together. In the first place, the depth of water to be applied annually
to Ends under irrigation, or the depth that will secure the best results from wet culture, is a prime con-
sideration in any scheme for the utilisation of the river waters as an aid to agriculture. Victoria being the
most advanced State in the establishment of irrigation under Government control, it will be advisable to
consider her methods and the results. In the earlier irrigation projects the depth of water proposed to be
applied to the land annually was from I2in. to 16in., wet cultivation being then looked to chiefly as an
insurance against drought, to be made as widely applicable as possible. In fact, these early schemes might
properly be regarded as the natural expansion of still older ones, whose aim was merely the conservation,,
storage, and supply of water for stock, and for the ordinary purposes of the farm and the station. Such
schemes for the supply of water to the agricultural and pastoral districts had been carried out in Victoria
earlier even than 1880?in some cases by the Government, in others by corporations under powers con-
ferred by local government acts, and, for the most part, with funds advanced by the State. By the later
development they became divided into two classes?those whose functions w r ere restricted to the supply of
water for domestic and general use and for stock, in what may be termed the dry-farming areas; and those
supplying water for irrigation. All the corporations borrowing from the Government undertook to pay
interest on the sums advanced. Of those Avhose functions were restricted to ordinary water supply a
few have met their financial obligations in full, or nearly so. The majority have made some substantial
contribution towards the discharge of their liabilities. On the other hand, the irrigation trusts have, with
little exception, failed to provide interest on their loans. Bodies invested with the combined functions
of water supply and irrigation have generally met the claims for interest falling due in respect of their
borrowings for water supply only. In respect of advances for the construction of irrigation works, the
undertaking as to repayments has remained almost wholly a dead letter.
28. Under the provisions of the law now in force?the Water Act , 1905 the whole of the irri-
gation works, and several of the schemes for domestic and stock supply, have passed under the control of
the Government, as represented by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. One of the drier
purposes of the creation of this body is that it may employ the wide powers with which it is invested to
obtain for the State a revenue commensurate with its outlay, as well on works carried out by its own officers,
as on loans advanced in years gone by to trusts to carry out their authorised schemes. The Act referred to
passed both Houses of Parliament almost without opposition?certainly without any vigorous or con-
certed opposition. Notwithstanding this, it has evoked considerable hostility in the districts where
steps have been taken to put it in force. Under the old law landholders were free to irrigate
their holdings or to leave them unirrigated, as they might think fit. Under the Act of 1905 it is
incumbent on them to irrigate a certain proportion of so much of each farm as is not absolutely
unfit for irrigation?or, more strictly, to pay for the water necessary therefor. Now Ministers have announced
their intention to ask Parliament to invest the Government, and the Commission, with more comprehensive
powers. It is proposed that in irrigation districts to be hereafter constituted the area of holdings of land
will range from 20 to 200 acres, the average not exceeding 100 acres. The allotment of water to these
properties is to be sufficient to irrigate the entire area of each to a depth of 24in. each year. It is claimed!
that by these means the best use of both land and water will be promoted, and improved opportunities
given for men of limited resources to obtain homes. Where present owners of irrigable lands within such
districts x*efuse to subdivide their properties, or to sell to the State that they may be used for closer settle-
ment, powers will be taken for compulsory purchase.
29. In a publication issued by authority of the Government, it is stated that the aim of the new policy
is to provide farms small enough to be within the reach of men who have little beyond their own industry
and thrift, as well as holdings large enough to attract men of organising ability who have capital ta
invest. Examples are given of actual results realised on irrigated farms within the State; which, if they
may be accepted without qualification, go to show that the anticipations on which the new policy is based
are within the compass of possible realisation. The first case cited is of a farm of 56 acres, yielding for the.
past year a gross money return over �5 per acre ; the second refers to a holding of 27 acres, with a gross;
return slightly under �4 per acre ; the third, of 36 acres, returning �5 6s. per acre ; and the fourth, of 17
acres, yielding for the year �lB per acre. The details of these statements seem reasonable and consistent
enough with the following exceptions :?ln example 1, the milk yield is valued at �8 per cow ; in example
2, at �l2. The former of these is well within the compass of belief ; the latter unattainable, except in rare
and favorable circumstances. In the fourth example the price of lucerne hay on the farm is put down at �3
per ton?a rate higher than has ruled, even in the city, except in seasons of drought. But it is admitted in
the publication referred to that the demand for irrigation blocks in the areas already subdivided and offered
for settlement has not realised expectations. The slackness is thus accounted for?? The sole and sufficient
reason for this limited demand is that very few well-to-do Victorian farmers want to become irrigators. They
wish to continue the combination of grain-growing and lamb-raising, which has proven so satisfactory outside
the irrigated areas, and which requires large holdings. The opportunities of pioneer farming on large
holdings of cheap land in other States are more alluring than those of intensive culture on small holdings
under irrigation. The first is a continuation of what they understand ; the second is a step into the unknown.?
It might with reason have been added that men who have after years of laborious effort found a haven of
rest will be cautious in risking the fruits of the past in what the chairman of the Commission aptly'
describes as ? A step into the unknown.? There is also to be reckoned with, the unwillingness of the
average citizen, presuming that he knows his business, to be coerced into substituting for his own methods
those favored by authority. The change of feeling towards irrigation, especially towards irrigation under-
state control, ought not to excite surprise. It now presents itself under an aspect totally different from
that under which it evoked much enthusiasm among the dwellers in the warmer districts of Victoria, some
twenty-five years ago. Then it appeared as an insurance against the more terrible effects of seasons of
drought. Now it comes as a benefit in which the older settlers will not share?as a means of planting a new
race of cultivators on the soil, rather than of protecting the interests of those already established. 30. A-


30. A non-sentimental difficulty that seems likely to arise in time in a settlement of small holdings,
where every acre is irrigated and devoted to intense culture, is that of arranging for a systematic rotation of
crops. This feature of farming is one of the most characteristic, and probably best, of the British system;
and it has proved no less advantageous in the cultivation of fruit than in that of grain, flax, or roots. One
pf the best known and best informed writers on the wine business of France, Dr. Jules Guyot, insists
strongly on its necessity in what has been from a very remote time the chief rural industry of that country.
Good wine cannot be produced from immature plants, nor can heavy yields be obtained from exhausted soils.
In any one of the great vineyards of this, the premier agricultural country of Europe, the area at any time
actually under vines rarely exceeds about 300 acres. This is true of such properties as Chateau Lafitte,
Chateau Margaux, Chateau La Rose, Chablis, Clos Yougeot, &c. At the same time the area under cultiva-
tion, worked on a system of rotation wherein the vine is a prominent element, will generally embrace 1,200
or even 2,000 acres. The point as to which opinions chiefly differ is the duration or period of the rotation,
expert vignerons favoring periods varying, from about 25 to about 75 years. Suppose the area of the
property to be 1,800 acres, and that of mature vines still in vigorous bearing (say, from seven to seventy-
five years of age) 300 acres, each plant might, under the short rotation system, occupy the same site for 20
years, under the long-period system for 60. The portion of the property not actually under vines is devoted
to ordinary farming, carrying crops of grain, hay, potatoes, beans, &c., or is laid down temporarily in pasture;
those crops being generally preferred that give rise to the greatest volume of farm-yard manure. It is true
that the vine is not extensively irrigated in France, at least not where the production of wine is the ultimate
object; except in the department of the Bouches du Rhone, where irrigated vineyards have largely sup-
planted irrigated madder fields, since madder cultivation has been extinguished by the introduction of
aniline dyes. Few plants are so well adapted for intense culture as the vine ; whether as an agent for the
improvement of the soil, and its reduction to a high culturable condition; or for providing an assured income
to the cultivator as the reward of his labor. A great step forward will be made if means can be devised of
combining intense culture, especially under irrigation, with a proper system of rotation. The difficulty is a
remote one, but for that reason none, the less real.
31. The difficulties that have been experienced in getting Australian youths to take up the areas
thrown open to selection, under the system of subdivision into small blocks, have induced the chairman of
the Commission to recommend the introduction of immigrants from abroad, from the Western States of
America or from the irrigating countries of Europe. A course more likely to prove acceptable to the
Australian public, and not less likely to prove successful in acclimatising methods of intense culture, would
be to send Australian youths abroad to learn, by seeing for themselves, the ways and practices of other
countries. The cost of an experiment of this kind would be well-spent money. No high attainments or
lengthy period of preliminary training would be necessary. The educational standard need aim no higher
than the certificate of the State school; with the addition, except in the case of lads going to America, of so
much knowledge of French, Spanish, or Italian as any industrious and capable youth might acquire in six
months. The candidate for an appointment should of course be of the farming class ; able to manage
horses, to hold the plough, and to perform the ordinary operations of tillage. The money provision made
for him need include nothing more than a steerage passage to his port of destination (his living he will be
expected to earn), a sum, in the event of sickness, to be paid only on the warrant of the British consular
agent in his land of residence, and after the lapse of about three years the cost of a return passage to his
home. Less than �1,500 a year would be ample to cover the entire cost; and to ensure the introduction
each year of six or eight lads, conversant by actual personal experience with the methods in use in countries
where irrigation is the heritage of centuries.
32. Irrigation as hitherto practised in the Murray River Valley, in South Australia, is of two essentially
distinct types ; namely, that on the low-lying river flats, reclaimed from liability to inundation, more or less
frequent, by the construction of levees, and generally irrigable by gravitation; and high-lying lands in the
country adjacent to the river flats, commandable only by pumping. Some of the protective levees intended
to secure these low-lying areas against invasion by the river were inspected in company with Mr. Kellett,
the local officer in charge of construction. On some of the reclaimed lands there was surface water,
apparently not soaking through the embankments, but from ordinary rainfall, excessive irrigation, or seepage
rising in the fields where the cultivated area is below the water level in the river. There did not
seem to be any difficulty in dealing wuth it by the collecting drains, sump wells, and pumps, provided for
the purpose; nor is any other provision called for. The material used in the protective embankments is of
poor quality, shrinking and compressing excessively in drying. It is, however, the best obtainable at warrant-
able cost. Mr. Kellett says he uses core material of semi-decomposed limestone where special bond seems
necessary. The inspector relies on his own judgment solely in the selection and mode of using materials.
An embankment was noticed in course of construction near Burdett in dangerous proximity to live trees.
Some of these, as seen from the river, appeared to be within 30ft. of the toe of the earthwork; so near that
they could not without difficulty be felled clear of the embankment, and yet that if allowed to remain their
roots would be a source of imminent danger to it. Roots of growing trees are most destructive to earth-
works; so much so that no live tree ought to be allowed nearer to a bank than 100 ft. or 120 ft. There was also
inspected an area of about 1,500 acres of reclaimed land, the property of Mr. Morphett, near Wood?s Point.
The embankments are similar in character to those carried out by the Government, except perhaps that they
are a little stouter. They have been in existence 25 years, are well executed, and in excellent order. The
reclaimed land, chiefly used for growing fodder, is said to carry two cows per acre. The fertility of these
river-flat lands in general is remarkable.
33. The progress made in irrigation, on the high lands adjacent to the river flats, will be best explained
by transcribing the notes of personal inspections ;?At Mildura, a fruit-growing settlement adjacent to the
river, in the State of Victoria, founded about twenty-three years ago by the Messrs. Chaffey, the total area
now under cultivation appears to be about 12,000 acres. Almost the whole is irrigated, although the depth
of water used varies greatly with the season and with the kind of crop grown. During the current season the
volume


volume of water used has been much below the average, in consequence of the frequent and abundant rains.
The principal crops arc?of vines ; White Muscat of Alexandria, Sultanas, Zante currants ; also lemons,
oranges, apricots, olives?chiefly for oil?lucerne and other fodder plants, culinary vegetables. The present
population is nearly 5,000 ; the annual money value of the produce grown, about �3O per acre, equal to
about �7O per head of the whole resident population. Local business is good, and the place has an air of
increasing permanence and prosperity. The pumping plants have recently been to a certain extent consolidated,
and they have been strengthened, so that the efficiency has been improved and the cost of working reduced.
The channels, with a few notable exceptions, are in good order; so also are the channel structures, generally.
The same is true of the machinery.
The town of Wentworth, at the mouth of the Darling, has suffered some falling off of prosperity in
recent years?chiefly by the decline of river traffic, due mainly to the diversion of the carrying trade from
the rivers to the New South Wales railways. The decline, however, seems to have been arrested, and the pros-
perity of trade, in some measure, restored, by the increase of settlement at the irrigation colony, established
some three or four miles above the town, on lands near the Murray. Time did not permit of visiting this
settlement. A few facts were learned in regard to it from business people in Wentworth.
Examined the pumping plants, channels, and plantations, at the Renmark Settlement ; and obtained
certain particulars from Mr. Edward Olorenshaw, the chairman of the Trust. At present (4th October) one
plant only is running, viz., that supplying the 60ft. channel. It consists of a compound Tangye engine of
200-h.p. nominal, driving two centrifugal pumps; a third pump is not connected. It lifts from the billabong,
or backwater, known as the ? Reservoir,? into the main channel of the 60ft. system. This plant is in
good order and condition. Other plants examined, not working, were in fair order. The channels
were also in fair order. The plantations in general were weedy-?in consequence, probably, of the moist
season; otherwise they were healthy. The area now under irrigated culture at Renmark is 5,200 acres.
There are, in addition, 550 acres of cereal crop, chiefly for hay and green feed. The water supplied to the
irrigators is, according to the chairman, about 20in. per annum at the fields. The population numbers about
1,800. The principal crops grown are White Muscat, Sultanas, Zante currants, oranges, apricots, pears,
olives (chiefly for oil), and culinary vegetables. The place is prosperous.
The Lyrttp village settlement was founded in 1894. There were originally 40 members of the associa-
tion. settlers on horticultural blocks. Of these 24, or their representatives, remain in possession. The total
present population is 103. The land under irrigated culture is now about 400 acres, viz., 230 under vines ;
35 other fruits ?apricots, oranges, &c.; and about 135 in cereals, lucerne, and fodder crops. This comprises
besides the settlers? blocks, a considerable area cultivated by the association for the common benefit. There
is also a part of the land conceded to the association let for ordinary farming?some at rates as low as less
than 6d. per acre, some at higher rates. Some of the plantations visited were exceedingly clean and well
kept ?in fact, models of high culture. The plant comprises one 25-h.p. steam engine and one 15in. centri-
fugal pump. The secretary, Mr. Brown, says that the depth of water applied to the plantations reaches in
some years to as much as 36in. This is probably the volume pumped, including considerable loss by
percolation from the unlined channels. The water charge to the settlers is 30s. per acre per annum. The
proceeds of this charge, with the amount recieved as rents of land let for farming, is devoted to the cost of
maintenance and management, interest on loan advances, and repayment of principal by instalments spread
over 42 years.
Examined about 16,000 acres of land lying to the east, north-east, and south-east of the township of
Loxton, chiefly in the hundreds of Gordon and Bookpurnong. About three-fourths of the area inspected is
occupied by agricultural settlers, and a further part is in process of being prepared by intending settlers for
occupation. The soil is everywhere of red sandy loam, waging in character from almost pure sand to rather
stiff clayey soil. It is well-grassed throughout and timbered with open forest of box, pine, mallee, sandal-
wood, and undergrowth of scrub plants. The holdings near the Murray frontage are supplied with water
from the river?in many cases by pumping by means of windmills, in others by carting for domestic use, the
stock being driven to water. A considerable extent of the land further from the river is supplied by water
drawn from bores or wells sunk to depths reaching to as much as 200 ft. The water from the bores and
although used by stock, and even for household purposes, is not of unexceptionable quality, being generally
hard, sometimes even brackish. The country, so far as can be judged by the eye, is capable of being served
from the river by pumping in conjunction with a proper system of distributing channels. Of the 12,000
acres, or thereabouts, of occupied lands at least 6,000 acres is under crop. The cultivation is entirely of
wheat?apparently chiefly for grain, in part probably for hay. Some of the fields show excellent growth,
likely to yield 20bush. per acre. More than half would certainly exceed 12bush. ; none would, unless the.
weather prove very unfavorable,return less than 6bush. or Shush. The stock, both dairy cattle and beeves, are in
splendid condition. The same is true of the working horses, and there are numerous fine stallions also in
good flesh.
At Lake Bonney and the site of the projected Cobdogla irrigation scheme the level of water in the
river on Bth October was 17ft. 6in. on the gauge at Overland Corner, and the lake was full to about that
level. Examined the character of country and soil of the lands proposed to be irrigated. It consists of.
undulating downs, lightly timbered with box, myall, and hop bush ; the ground herbage of inferior grass,
with patches of spinifex. There are also small areas of sandridges timbered with pine. The soil in general
is a rather stiff red loam. In some parts the subsoil is of nodular limestone. In the north-eastern and:
northern part of the area the country is of the character known as red mallee. This is more sandy than that
above referred to, and is better adapted for irrigation, but the area is limited. Reports on this project have
been printed for public information?from the surveyors? point of view, and with respect to the character
and quality of soil, by Mr. W. Porter ; from the point of view of the engineer, and with respect chiefly to
the estimated cost of the works of storage and distribution, by Mr. A. B. Moncrieff, late Engineer-in-Chief.
The estimated capital cost of the works is �83,000. The storage ought, in any case, to be made available
for supplementing the natural volume of the river, in much the same way as it has been proposed to
utilise Lake Victoria. The supplement would in this case, however, be of value for irrigation and general
water supply rather than for navigation. It will be advisable to reserve the land, the site of the
Cobdogla scheme, from occupation or sale until its value for irrigation has been practically tested.
34. The


34. The depression known as Lake Bonney is also part of the site of another and more ambitious storage
scheme, the Parcooea Reservoir. This is described in some detail in a published plan and report by
Mr. Moncrietf. The report is by no means sanguine as the following extracts will show ; ?? There is only
one cross section of tbe river available in the neighborhood of Overland Corner. This shows in some
respects a suitable site for the work required, but the foundations of the weir would require to be of abnormal
proportions, and the exact location cannot, therefore, be finally determined until a much more exhaustive
examination of the neighborhood has been made. I estimate approximately that the works necessary at this
place, as described above, would cost �210,000 ; but, in making this statement, I would ask the Hon. the
Commissioner to note that the estimate is based upon outline sketches only, and that if a thorough examina-
tion of the neighborhood is made, as recommended above, it is probable that not only can the site be changed
with advantage, but that the cost of the work may be lowered.? From a careful examination of the locality
without, however, any instrumental survey, the site selected appears, on the face of the matter, especially in
respect of storage capacity, to be the most suitable. The cliff in the left bank shows beds of stratified
impure limestone. The slope in the right bank is of the ordinary loam of the locality, probably overlying
limestone, bedded, and in the form of rubble. The flat is of like character. The cliff in the left is precipitous
?probably ior�to 1. There will be considerable cost involved in making water-tight bond here with the
abutment of a structure; the like difficulty may be anticipated with the foundations. The underlying
material is shown, by some borings that have been made, to consist of alternating beds of sand and sandy
clay, resting on sandy limestone, with intercalated layers of soft clayey sandstone; an unpromising footing
for such a structure. The barrage will, when the storage is full, have to carry a head of 40ft. of water, and
be capable of safely discharging over its flood escapes a volume that must be reckoned as a possible six
millions of cubic feet per minute. The local stone also is neither sound enough nor hard enough to be suitable for
the aggregate of concrete. Stone for that purpose will have to be carried to the locality. Suitable sites for
storage dams, in situations commanding the lands of the Murray Valley, in South Australia, are certainly not
numerous within the State. They are, in fact, hard to find; and such as they are, the difficulties and con-
sequent cost of construction is likely to be excessive. Failing suitable and economical sites in South Australia,
negotiations might be opened with the Upper Riverine States to secure an interest in storages within their
territories. The stored water would, of course, be sent down the river channel, to be diverted or pumped to
the points where it may be required. In clause 62 of the unratified agreement referred to in paragraph 10 of
this report, there occurs the following :??Any State shall have the right to make use of the channel of any
river or stream as a conduit for tbe conveyance of stored water to any point of diversion.? It may be
presumed that a like provision will be embodied in any agreement that may be arrived at, in substitution for
that referred to.
35. The Murray Bridge town supply is pumped from the river into an elevated tank, from which it
is distributed through pipes by gravitation. It appears liable to become more or less affected by salt
in protracted periods of drought, and consequent low river. In a provincial town, with a popu
lation somewhat larger than at Murray Bridge, a like difficulty was experienced during several years,
the town supply being pumped from a river, perfectly fresh during winter floods, but salter than the lower
Murray, after a month or two of drought. As a tentative remedy, a tank, partly excavated and partly
embanked, was constructed in what fortunately proved good holding ground, and of capacity sufficient to
give a fair domestic supply, throughout the summer. The tank was filled with water, drawn from the river
by means of a floating arm, from a level of less than 2ft. under the surface; stored there until the
river water began to get brackish, in its lower levels; and for the remainder of the season the public
supply was lifted into an elevated tank, by the same pumping plant, and thence distributed as at Murray
Bridge., The method was entirely successful, and the works are still in operation. Fresh water, being
lighter than salt, floats on its surface; and although there is a certain tendency to fusion, by the
property of fluids known as osmosis , the separation remains sufficient for most practical purposes, for a greater
or less length of time. A floating arm at the suction intake, raised or lowered, from time to time, according
to the condition of the liver water, is used in pumping the supply for the railway service at Murray Bridge.
A like expedient should be adopted in the case of the town supply.
36. Pumping water from the river, whether for town supply, for irrigation, or to meet the domestic and
ordinary needs of agricultural or pastoral settlers, and for the cattle grazing on their lands, should be
discontinued when the stream becomes foul or stagnant. To secure the best and freshest water, it
should be taken from a depth of not more than 18in. or 2ft. under the surface, and where exposed to
sunlight. The volume pumped should bear a definite and uniform ratio to the population to be
served, the land to be treated, or the area to be supplied. The service to an urban population, in our
climate, should be not less than 40galls. per head per day in cool, moist weather; and need not exceed
lOOgalls. in the heat of summer; except where garden irrigation is practised, in which case water should
be paid for by measure. The, daily demand will be somewhat larger in a manufacturing than in a purely
residential town ; and the maximum is usually between the hours of 6 and 10 a.m. Generally, it may be
anticipated that half the daily consumption will be during those four hours. For the irrigation of land the
depth will vary with the character of the soil and the nature of the crops grown. In northern Victoria a net
depth of 24in. per annum has been adopted by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission as that to be
supplied to landholders in the irrigation districts; a like rule seems to prevail in South Australia. The
equivalent of a depth of 24in., during the irrigating season, to the lands commanded by the channel system,
with, however, a liberal margin for contingencies, is generally the normal capacity of irrigation pumping
plants in this State. Where a pumped supply of water is to be delivered through channels to the holdings
of settlers in the dry-farming districts, it is as essential as in the case of supplies for irrigation that tbe
volume delivered should bear a definite proportion to the area of land served. In the State of Victoria,
where a large extent of dry-farming country is thus watered, and a thriving population maintained on land
otherwise almost unproductive, necessity has compelled the adoption of a regulation fixing the minimum
capacity and depth of settlers? tanks relatively to the areas of their holdings ?that is to say, to the number
of cattle grazing thereon. The same regulation provides that water shall be supplied once only in each year
This is to avoid the enormous waste entailed by sending water down channels in porous soil in hot dry
-weather. (Waste may be minimised by lining the channels with concrete of native lime, where this material


is available; a method of which numerous excellent examples are to be seen in this State.) The
minimum fixed by the by-law is equivalent to about Ingalls. per acre per day throughout the year?a not
too liberal provision to cover use and waste. It is, however, the minimum ; the maximum may presumably
be any reasonable quantity demanded, provided there is stock on the land to use it, and there are tanks in
which to store it. It would not be too much to say that the value of land, such as that inspected near
Loxton, would be greatly enhanced by the provision of an assured water supply on some such basis as this.

erection, by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. Appendix IV. is a summary of the plant and
works, with their duty and cost, of the Long Lake Waterworks District.
37. Conclusions in regard to the irrigation and general water supply aspects of the Murray waters
question in South Australia may be thus summarised:?
The depth of water to be provided for irrigation in settlements devoted thereto, may be fixed, tenta-
tively, at 24in. per annum ; whether on the reclaimed land of the river flats, or on the high land adjacent.
Regular and consistent rotation of crops should be encouraged under every form of cultivation, whether
wet or dry, and under all conditions of occupancy.
It will be better to send young Australian farmers abroad, to study irrigation where it is practised, than
to bring immigrant irrigators to Australia to teach settlers here.
There are extensive areas of dry land in South Australia, where profitable settlement might be pro-
moted by the supply of water for domestic and ordinary purposes. The country about Loxton, described in
paragraph 33 of the foregoing, may be taken as typical of a large area of country of this class. The value
of such lands would be greatly enhanced by the provision of an assured moderate supply of water.
Water for domestic use, pumped from rivers or other natural sources, should be drawn by a floating arm
from a depth of not more than 2ft. under the surface, and where exposed to sunlight. The purest and most
wholesome water is generally to be found in this situation.
The lands embraced in the Lake Bonney projected irrigation scheme should be reserved from sale and
occupation. The lake may eventually prove of value as a storage, whether the lands directly commanded
should or should not prove suitable for irrigated culture.
In the event of sites for reservoirs, on a scale of sufficient magnitude,not being found available in this State
negotiations should be opened, with the upper riparian States, for the conclusion of a partnership agreement,,
whereby South Australia might share in the use of storages therein, and in the use of the water impounded.
PROPOSALS FOR THE EXCLUSION OF THE SEA FROM THE LAKES AT THE.
MURRAY MOUTH, AND FOR THE RECLAMATION OF THE LAKE BEDS.
38. The purpose of the proposed barrage, for the exclusion of the waters of the sea from Lakes-
Alexandrina and Albert, and from the Coorong and others of the channels connected with these lakes, is to
maintain the impounded water permanently fresh. Obviously, therefore, a necessary sequence of the con-
struction of the barrage will be, a supply of fresh water to be sent down the Murray to make good the waste
caused by evaporation. The water so sent down could not be abstracted for irrigation, or any other economic
purpose ; it is a necessary condition of the case that it must not be interfered with. The surface area of the
lakes and channels referred to is 192,000 acres; and the evaporation from this sheet, at the rate of 60in. per
annum ?it is not likely to be less than this?will be 42,000 millions of cubic feet per annum. The loss
of water entailed by giving effect to such a proposal would be about one-seventh of the total discharge of the
Murray at Morgan, in an average low year, of which there have been 10 during the 23 years covered by the
recorded gaugings. Or, again, it would be nearly one-half of the total discharge at Morgan, for the
minimum year, 1902. It is hopeless to expect that the upper States would consent to send down such a.
volume of fresh water, in low years, to bo dissipated by evaporation from the lakes ; nor does it seem likely
that by invoking the aid of any higher authority they could be constrained to do so. The construction of the
barrage, as an engineering work, would involve no insurmountable difficulty ; but the proposal to maintain
the freshness of the lakes, in low years, at the cost of such a terrible consumption of river water ought to be
definitely abandoned.
39. It is however evident that, on the completion of the diversions, actual and proposed, by the upper
Riparian States, the channel from the lowest lock, near Swan Reach to the debouchement at Lake Alexandrina,
a distance of 114 miles, and thence to the sea mouth, will be exposed, in seasons of low river, to become salt
by the influx of water from the sea. In fact from Swan Reach downward the river channel will gradually
become normally salt. The principal interests affected by this change would be : ?228 miles of river
frontage, with the lands to a distance of, say, six miles from the river banks ; the South Australian railways,
in respect of the water services at Murray Bridge and at Tailem Bend; the towns of Mannum, Murray
Bridge, Tailem Bend, and Wellington, and some minor hamlets, in respect of their domestic and general
water supplies; and about 7,000 acres of reclaimed river flats, protected by flood embankments and
occupied by settlers; with a further 29,000 acres of similar lands that might be reclaimed and settled.
The most obvious means of excluding the sea from this portion of the channel, and maintaining fresh water
therein, would be the construction of a barrage at the debouchement , between the capes?locally known as
Pomanda Point and Low Point?on either side the entrance to the arm of Lake Alexandrina into which the
river waters are discharged; with a by-pass, and lock, across the neck of the peninsula that forms the
boundary of the arm on the west; and the maintenance of a constant stream of fresh water from above.

to make good the loss by evaporation in this limited area. The barrage would be three miles in length,
that being the distance between the capes; and the level of its crest one foot above gravity surface
of water in lakes. The maximum volume of river flood, to be discharged over the crest, must be assumed
as 6,000,000 cub. ft. per minute. Adopting a reasonable velocity of 3ft. per second, 2'045 miles per hour,
the depth of water on the crest of the barrage, during the discharge of such floods, would be 2Toft.
The pass would be an excavated channel of 50ft. bed width, by 7ft. carrying depth, and about 2,000 ft.
in length; from the fresh water impounded in the arm to the salt water in Lake Alexandrina; with
a lock at a suitable site to admit of the passage of boats, while preventing the flux or reflux of water
between them. The highest level of surface of flood water, in front of the barrage, above normal
level of Lake Alexandrina, would thus be 3*l Oft.; the ordinary drop for boats passing through the lock,
from the fresh water of the river to salt water in the lake, Ift. ; and the maximum drop daring extreme
river floods, 3 1 Oft. It is impossible here to give anything like a detailed design of the works involved
in this proposal, or any reliable estimate of their cost. This could not be undertaken without an expenditure
of time and money not warranted by the instructions under which this report has been prepared. As an
approximation, a barrage of rough stone, with internal re-inf or cement, the body of the most suitable material
procurable in the vicinity, the exposed faces of random granite blocks from the quarries near Mannum ; top
width 10ft., external slopes Ito 1, may be expected to cost not less than �135,000. The pass, of the
dimensions given, with a lock of cement concrete masonry, of like dimensions with those in the river, may be
expected, should the ground prove favorable, to cost �20,000 or �25,000. For the entire work, say,
�160,000. Besides the cost of the barrage, pass, and lock, there has to be considered the protective levees
of the 7,000 acres of lands mentioned above as reclaimed and settled; and the enhancement of cost of
reclaiming the 29,000 acres of reclaimable flats, that certainly will be reclaimed and settled, if the lower river
be not caused to become salt. The alternative to the construction of the barrage, or of some effective work
to exclude sea water from the lower river, is supply by pumping from above Swan Beach, if the river be
canalised; from some indefinite point above Morgan, if it be not canalised; and the conveyance of the
pumped water ?by channels or otherwise?to the railway stations at Murray Bridge and Tailem Bend; to
the towns and hamlets on the river banks ; and to the lands near the river requiring a supply. There is also
to be taken into account the fact that 7,000 acres of land,reclaimed and occupied, will have to be abandoned;
and that 29,000 acres of valuable reclaimable land will be rendered irreclaimable.
40. The foregoing statement as to the inevitable saltness of the lower Murray, in the event of the
diversion of the upper waters, without due provision for a compensation supply, may appear startling. Of
the facts, however, there seems no room for doubt; a comparison of the tide gauge levels with those in the
lakes and lower river, puts them beyond question. Taking as datum the level of ordinary low water springs,
in the open sea, outside the entrance, and adopting it as zero, we have, from the recorded tide gaugings, the
following levels, invariable, save to a very limited extent under the influence of continued high winds:
That they are not absolutely identical need occasion no surprise ; the differences may be due to imperfections
of observation, or to the influence of the form of coast-line, or in part to each of these causes. The high
level at Meningie may, with reason, be ascribed to the obstruction caused by the narrowness of the entrance
to Lake Albert. But, at Morgan, 158 miles above the site of the proposed ban-age between Pomanda Point
and Low Point, the level of the surface of water in the river, throughout April, May, and June, in 1902, and
March and April, 1903, at the culmination of the long drought, was o'B7 above zero ; that is to say it was, to
all intents and purposes, identical with that of the surface of water in the lakes. During those months the
volume flowing in the Murray at Morgan remained steadily at 24,000 cub. ft. per minute, the equivalent of
13,000 millions of cubic feet per annum. The state of the river at Morgan, should diversions be increased
to such an extent as to reduce the volume there to 24,000 cub. ft. per minute, will inevitably be that of an
ordinary arm of the sea, slightly modified by the access of a small fresh water creek.
41. The reclamation of the lake beds, and their conversion into habitable land, another proposal that has
to be considered, would, within certain limits, effect the same purpose as that aimed at by the construction
of the barrage referred to in 38, It would diminish the loss by evaporation, by reducing the area of surface ex-
posed to the action of sun and wind ; so that, in time, the surplus discharge of the river, even in low years,
might be sufficient to maintain fresh water throughout the reduced area. It would certainly be many years
before the reduction of water surface could be expected to reach such proportions as to establish a constant
balance between the loss by evaporation and the gain by the river surplus. Still, that condition is the point
that would be ultimately attained, and towards which progress would constantly move. Such a proposal as
the reclamation of these lakes is by no means without precedent. A large part of the County of Lincoln, in
England, known as the fen country, has been reclaimed from the sea; and for centuries kept dry, habitable,
and culturable, by unremitting pumping. The same is true of almost the entire area of the Kingdom of
Holland. There need be no question as to the possibility of the thing being done ; the doubt is, whether
the game is worth the candle. Neither need there be any serious question as to the value of the reclaimed
land, for pastoral and agricultural settlement. It would, for a time, no doubt, prove infertile by excess of
salt in the soil; but that condition would gradually disappear, as the salt got washed into the drains and
sump wells, and removed by the pumps. The minor project, at present under discussion, is the reclamation
oi Lake Albert. Some idea of the character and surroundings of this lake may be gathered from the
following notes of a personal inspection :
Lake Albert; 15th October, 1909.?The entrance to the lake, from the jetty on one side to the
lighthouse on the other, is about 1,700 ft. wide. The depth in the navigation channel, where it crosses the
line of the proposed reclamation embankment, as shown on the plans, is from 7ft. to Bft. Further up, in
the narrows, it shoals to about 3ft. 6in. ; the channel being flanked by reedbeds and swamps. Further up
still, about two and a half miles above the jetty, the depth was about 7ft. Following the usual navigation
track, up the lake, towards Meningie, further soundings gave 6ft., Bft., and 7ft, 6in. The bidk of the land,
In private hands, around Lake Albert, as well as the bulk of lands so held around the lakes in general,
whether freehold or leasehold, is occupied for pastoral rather than for agricultural purposes. The area of
cultivation


cultivation is very small, even where the soil is (apparently) of good quality, and of character adapted for
tillage. At present the water of the lake is fresh, or nearly so ; but, especially in the upper part of the lake,
it has a disagreeable flavor, like that from a swamp or stagnant pool The settlers on the lands bordering
the lake are supplied by surface water, collected in small dams, or water paddocks. Water for culinary and
other domestic purposes is collected from the roofs and stored in tanks. The township of Meningie, about
120 inhabitants, is thus supplied.
42. A special danger to which persons residing near the areas undergoing reclamation will be exposed is
liability to malarial fever. This will be understood from the following extract from a report to the Foreign
Office, by the British Consular Agent in the Netherlands, on the Draining of the Zuider Zee: ???With
respect to the results of the reclamation from a hygienic point of view the following remarks may be made
on the basis of the observations of the States Commission on the subject:?During the process of
reclaiming, the drying marshy soil may bring about the development of malarial diseases. The same
will be the case in the first few years after the reclamation, during the subdivision and preparation
of the ground. The workmen employed in these occupations will be exposed to malarial influences-
Ihe manner in which the work will be carried on will, however, greatly influence the hygienic con-
ditions under which the workmen are placed. By arranging the reclamation in successive and not too'
large areas, and shortening as much as possible the marshy stage ; furthermore, by making the water-
level sink as quickly as possible, and so far as is practicable by keeping it at an equal height, we have-
it in our power to shorten the malaria period. Besides we are now better equipped against malaria, both,
preventively and curatively, than formerly. The probability that malarial sickness would spread to any
considerable distance from the place of its origin is very slight. The possibility of being attacked by malaria
will remain confined to the reclaimed polders themselves, or the near neighborhood, along the shore of the
Zuider Zee. When once, however, the dangerous period is passed, the condition of the coast lands may be
considered as most probably more favorable to health than it is now.? But, these reclamations once begun,.,
and a certain measure of success attained, the work is sure to progress. The value of the reclaimed lands
will determine public opinion in its favor. And, as it progresses, many improvements in the mode of its
execution, in the alignment and location of the drainage channels, and in the slope and dressing of the
surface soil, will suggest themselves. Eventually, the channel of the Murray River will probably be carried
down to the sea, following a course, from the present mouth, about six miles below Wellington, so as to
leave Point McLeay on the left and Point Sturt on the right; thus converting the bed of Lake Alexandrina,
excepting only the channel itself, into dry land. From Point McLeay, the levee forming the left bank of
the channel would make direct for the eastern point of Long Island; while Long Island would be con-
nected to Mundoo Island, and thence to the Younghusband Peninsula, by continuing the levee across the
channels. The river water would then find its sole exit by the existing sea mouth ; or by some other mouth
opened in substitution therefor, through the sandhills. But the completion of such an undertaking belongs
to a time so far in the future that the discussion of its details partakes rather of the nature of vague
speculation than of tangible reality. Some idea of its probable cost may be gained from a brief statement
of the pumping work alone to be performed, in the drying of Lake Albert. The removal of the volume of
water lying on the lake bed, and of that contained in the soil underlying the bed, to a depth of about 3ft.
or 3|4?t., and its discharge into the new channel near Point McLeay, would absorb the entire work of a
pumping plant of 600 effective horsepower, during 340 24-hour days; in round numbers, one year of the
plant running three shifts continuously.
Assistance in the preparation of this report has been rendered by Mr. J. W. Jones, Secretary to the
Commissioner for Public Works, and by Mr. Graham Stewart, Engineer-in-Chief; by the supply of state-
ments of fact and documents for reference ; as well as by valuable suggestions and friendly criticism during;
the passage of the matter through the press.

Water Supply Commission requires all owners or occupiers of lands within the Long Lake Waterworks
District to make provision by dams or tanks for the storage on such lands of water supplied by the Commis-
sion for domestic and ordinary use and for watering cattle or other stock, that is to say :
The total tank capacity to be provided on every block of 640 acres shall not be less than 2,000 cub.
yds., and on every block of 320 acres shall not be less than 1,000 cub. yds. A block may
be supplied by more than one tank, but in no case shall any tank be of less capacity than 1,000
cub. yds.
Every tank must have a depth of at least 12ft.
Every tank must be connected with the supply channel by properly constructed drains of sufficient
capacity to take the full flow therefrom.
In future water will be run in each of the Commission?s channels to fill tanks once only in each
teak, commencing on Ist July, 1909, Settlers will be notified of the date when water will be sent down
the channels commanding their respective holdings.

WHITE CLIFFS PUMPING PLANT.
This consists of two units, each of which is a duplicate of the plant at Nyah, the conditions varying
only in the fact that the virtual head pumped against is 95ft.
The guaranteed ratio of work to theoretical effect is the same as at Nyah.
The plant has not yet been tested.
SWAN HILL PUMPING PLANT.
Work. ?To deliver 6,000 cub. ft. per minute against a virtual head of 18ft.
Plant. ? One triple expansion high speed Allen engine, of 250 revolutions per minute, and of 300>-
brake horsepower, with jet condenser and Edwards? air pumps, as at Nyah, direct-coupled to two 39in.
