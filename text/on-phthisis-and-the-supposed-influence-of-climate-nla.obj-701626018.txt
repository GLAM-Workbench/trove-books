“ The fact is, that at all these sanitaria, a
“ great amount of capital has been spent, and
“ the doctors and people connected with each
“ individual place find very good scientific
“ reasons for pronouncing their own locality
“ and elevations, the one that offers the best
“ conditions for chronic disease in general, and
“ for pulmonary disease in particular.
“ These one-sided views are often, if not
“ generally, entertained and defended in perfect
“ good faith, the concentration of thought on
“ one locality warping the judgment. In
“ science, however, we must learn to make
“ allowance for local partiality, and try to be
“ guided by purely scientific reasoning.”
Dr. J. Hughes Bennett , 1878.


“It is my hope and desire that it will

“ it the higher physicians will somewhat raise
“ their thoughts, and not devote all their
“ time to common cures, nor be honoured for
“ necessity only.”


PREFACE.
During many voyages in medical charge of
passenger ships sailing between England and
various parts of the world—lndia, China,
North and South America, the West Indies,
and six several times to different ports in
Australia, the author had fair means of noting
the effect of sea life on health, and of early
hearing about the good repute Australian
climates were rapidly gaining for their
supposed salutary influence, especially over
phthisis.
So prepared, he entered practice here in
1854, and began that series of observations to
which he now makes what he trusts may
prove no unimportant addition.
Cases soon came under notice disproving a
power in climate to prevent or cure phthisis,
or indeed, modify any specific malady.
Satisfied by clinical evidence, he was not slow
to say so.


One early instance occurred in a young
Tasmanian gentlewoman, in whom physical
signs alone plainly denoted double pulmonary
phthisis. Yet diagnosis was doubted, because
the disease was held to be unknown among
natives of the climatically favoured island.
Autopsy, in presence of more than one medical
man, revealed anfractuous cavities and vomicae,
riddling both lungs.
A reason once is a reason ever. The
case foreshadowed others likely to follow, for
which, indeed, one had not long to wait.
Few Victorians were then old enough to test
the theory ; but from the older colony numbers
sufficient were not wanting.
In 1857, th e author wrote to the then
newly inaugurated Australian Medical Journal ,
that “ men of deliberation would not hesitate
“to pronounce as premature any opinion as
“to the influence of climate on the health
“ and lives of the inhabitants of a country
“ before it was peopled.”
In the year following, 1858, Dr. Hall, of
Hobart Town, wrote in the same periodical
that “Tubercular Diseases” were in that


colony, “ a trifle beyond the London rate; ”
and then added, “ Scrofula is not a
“ Tasmanian disease ; it ought not to be
“in so dry and propitious a climate.”
These conflicting statements were hard to
reconcile.
When called, in 1859, by the Medical
Society of Victoria, to edit The Australian
Medical Journal, the author placed himself
in direct communication with Mr. R. Brough
Smyth, of the Surveyor-General’s staff, and
Dr. G. Neumayer, Director of the Flagstaff
Observatory, with a view to arrange about
making a joint series of observations on our
medical climatology, and special reports for
publication in the journal, in the January
number of which, for that year, appeared
the first instalment of our several contri-
butions. Before then, Mr. Smyth had himself
supplied meteorological reports to the journal,
so that, while Dr. Neumayer may have been
“ the first person to make observations on
the climate of Victoria on an extensive scale,”
as is in the Practitioner , of November, 1878,
claimed for him, he, noble worker though he


was, yet was not pioneer. Called to other
duty, both colleagues left their coadjutor
alone to fulfil the original intention. And
if he regretted that “ so good an argument
“ lighted on so poor an author” —like Rosalind ,
“ not a good epilogue,” he has done at least
negative good by inciting abler writers to
illustrate a subject abandoned apparently in
despair by the Medical Society, and by the
Central Board of Health wholly left un-
touched.
In 1870, the author gave the result of
those investigations.
In the following pages will be found evidence
sufficient to show that “in the time that
“ has since elapsed there have accumulated
“ materials the systematic collection and
“ arrangement of which would be of value;”
if, indeed, they do not go far to confirm
the truth of the primary proposition, that
climate exerts no influence whatever over
specific or contagious disease.
Those who would rather not mix practical
writings with speculative subtlety, and who do
not care to have topics not very agreeable


obtruded upon their attention, might well
weigh these words:—“ Things that are mean
“or even filthy,—things which must be
“ introduced with an apology,—such things,
“no less than the most splendid and
“ costly, must be admitted into natural
“ history. Nor is natural history polluted
“ thereby; for the sun enters the sewer no
“ less than the palace, yet takes no pollution.
“ That model, therefore, I follow. For what-
“ ever deserves to exist deserves also to be
“ known, for knowledge is the image of exist-
“ ence; and things mean and splendid exist
“ alike. From mean and sordid instances
“ there sometimes emanate excellent light and
“ information. Many things in this history to
“ common apprehension, or indeed to any
“ understanding accustomed to the present
“ system, will seem to be curiously and
“ unprofitably subtle. Let men be assured
“of this, that all subtlety of disputation and
“ discourse, if not applied till after axioms
“ are discovered, is out of season and
“preposterous; and that the true and proper,
“or at any rate the chief time for subtlety


in weighing experience and in founding
u axioms thereon.”
And although these principles did not lead
their enouncer to make any great discovery
of fundamental truths, such as the circulation
of the blood, the planetary revolutions, tidal
ebb and flow, formation of dew, or the corre-
lation of the physical forces, they yet carried
him near enough to them all to enable him
to point out the direct way for others; and
thus the great moral catalysis “moved the
intellects that moved the world,” until all
those natural laws were “ subdued to the uses
of human life.” I n like manner will research
by these laws directed, prove the opposite of
deductive or empirical systems that led to
erroi on climate, and “by dissecting and
making an anatomy of it” eventually reveal
the yet unknown efficient cause of typhoid
fever and phthisis, and give man empire
over them by teaching him to obey the
natural law of contagion.

ON PHTHISIS
AND THE
SUPPOSED INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE
Phthisis continues to be the most fatal dis-
ease in Victoria. “ Deaths from phthisis in
“ 1877 numbered 1088, which is a larger
“ number than was ever previously recorded
“in any year. A greater mortality in 1876
“ resulted from scarlatina, and in 1875 from
“ measles, than from phthisis, but these
“ epidemics having subsided, phthisis in 1877
“ resumed its place at the head of the list of
“ causes of death, thus showing itself to have
“ been in that year, as in nearly every other,
“ the most destructive of all complaints. The
“ death-rate from phthisis in Melbourne and
B


“ suburbs is much higher than that of the
“ whole colony, and increases from year to
“ year.” (Victorian Year Book, 1878.)
Moreover, of all deaths occurring in the
colony at ages from 20 to 35 years, lin
3*4 is from phthisis ; while in Melbourne and
suburbs of deaths at those ages 1 in 2*7 is
from that disease ; but in Victoria, excluding
Melbourne and suburbs, the ratio is lin
4*4. On a former occasion the ages were
taken at from 20 to 45 years, but now they
are selected at from 20 to 35, the better to
cover only natives of Australia.
Deaths from all Causes, and from Phthisis, at
AGES FROM 20 TO 35, IN 1877.

Victoria 1235 366 1 in 3-4
Melbourne and suburbs 616 224 lin 27
Victoria, excluding Mel-
bourne and suburbs 619 142 1 in 4*4
These proportions are greater than those
that were found when I wrote on the subject
e ight years ago, and justify every word then
said. Longer experience finds the progress
of the malady in this colony following in


every phase its usual course, unaltered and
unmodified by climate.
An elaborate effort was made some time
ago to refute this proposition, and a paper
has been prepared for perusal by people
living at a distance, to throw doubt on the
truth of writings that have been largely
cited in all parts of the world to disprove
the climatic theory of phthisis. A reply to
that document is due from me ; for the
value of the argument can only be sustained
by proof of my fidelity. That impugned, or
the accuracy of my premises disputed, silence,
by giving an apparently tacit acquiescence,
would make what I have written appear
unfounded, and no longer “an important
“ chapter in the natural history of the great
“ scourge of our race.”
Among many communications encouraging
me in this important social and medical
inquiry I here append one from a member
of the profession who long adorned the
highest office a medical man in England
can attain, and who is still professor of
medicine in one of her old universities

“ June 29, 1878.
“ My dear Sir, —
“ ... I venture to congratulate you
“on a really important contribution to the
“ aetiology of phthisis. The facts and argu-
“ ments have an interest and importance not
“ confined to the colony of Victoria. They
“go far, even standing by themselves, to
“ establish what is, I doubt not, true, but
“not yet recognised as true —that mere
“ climate is of infinitely less importance in
“ reference to phthisis than is the air habi-
“ tually breathed within the dwelling-house,
“ particularly when, as in in-door occupations,
“ the air of the house is the air in which
“ the person has to live. English physicians
“ occasionally benefit their patients by sending
“ them to Australia, but it is the life on
“ deck during the voyage that chiefly benefits
“ the phthisical patient.
“ The living in small houses, and the
“ custom of keeping the windows closed,
“ have, I am sure, a potent influence in
“ the production of phthisis. I could not
“ give the weighty evidence of large statistics,


“ but the fact has been impressed upon me
“ many times by the (otherwise inexplicable)
“ prevalence of phthisis in certain households
“or certain localities. In two villages in this
“ neighbourhood phthisis is very prevalent.
“ Both of them are mostly agricultural
“ villages. The people have no manufacturing
“or in-door occupations ; but in both there
“ is a habit of keeping the windows closed.
“ In one of them the only cause I know of
“is that a clay soil and elevated situation
“ make the climate rather colder than in
“ other places hereabouts. In the other place
“— a large village, with a population exceed-
“ ing 2000 the custom of keeping the
“ windows closed has a curious origin. The
“ place was famous for its cheese, and some
“ years ago 2000 cows were kept there.
“ These were driven into the village twice a
“ day to be milked, and in the summer
“ time were accompanied by so many flies
“ that the people, troubled with this plague of
“ flies, shut their windows to keep them out..
“ The custom once established has, more or
“ less, continued, and the tendency to phthisis


“ has, no doubt, been aggravated by inter-
“ marriages, to which the people of this
“ village are very prone.
“ But all this is little better than mere
“ gossip, not worthy to be sent across the
“ Pacific in a letter acknowledging your really
“ good work.
“ Accept, however, my thanks, and excuse
“ the delay in sending them.
“ Very faithfully yours,
H
“ William Thomson, Esq., &c.”
The views expressed in that letter are
based in good faith on the validity of my
data, and I shall show that the trust is not
misplaced. A private correspondent deserves
this from me even more than a public
reviewer, for he cannot so readily call me
to account if he thinks he has been misled.
In thus vindicating my former writings I shall
still apply pathological data to their legitimate
scientific purpose.
The want of adequate data to determine
every moot point being fully admitted, it is


yet agreed that enough exist to allow any
one to be fairly debated. Until after the
coming census of 1881, positive certainty
about an indicated freedom from or proclivity
to phthisis in Australians must remain in
abeyance, although conclusions have been
formulated as precisely as if they were
really derived from absolute information. The
number who died of phthisis at certain ages
is known, not the living population at those
ages —actual mortality, but not breathing
morbility. Deprecating rashness in me, my
opponents plunge into their own dictum.
Even the approaching census hardly pro-
mises to afford full means of finally deciding
any one point ; for in 1881 an influx of
visitors to see an exhibition will disturb the
proportions of the resident population, and
vitiate any conclusion drawn from them. It
will, therefore, be futile to defer further dis-
cussion, as was intended, for the question
will then be on no better footing, and we
may as well deal now as afterwards with
“ approximations ” that approach near enough
to practical reality.


The “ conclusions ” argued up to by the
Medical Society as opposed to mine are: —
ist. The mortality from phthisis in Victoria
is little more than half of that in England.
2nd. The rate of mortality from phthisis in
Victoria has been perceptibly less of late years.
3rd. That rate is especially low among
persons under 15 or 20 years of age, and
has been very greatly reduced between 1861
and 1871.
4th. The reduction of the mortality among
young persons is to be explained by a com-
parative immunity among those born in the
colony.
sth. The apparent increase of mortality
among young adults is due to the influx of
phthisical persons from abroad.
6th. The uniformity in the rate of mortality
over the whole colony for a good many
years, is owing to certain insanitary condi-
tions operating especially in Melbourne, since
for the rest of the colony the rate was
reduced by about one-third between 1861 and
1871.


Before pointing out all that is irrelevant and
wrong in these “ conclusions,” the Govern-
ment Statist must be allowed to answer
certain incidental references to the Victorian
Year Book, and his letter is here purposely
inserted.
“ Office of the Government Statist,
“ Melbourne, 16th January, 1877.
“ My dear Sir,
“ You ask me to express an opinion respecting
“the Report of the Medical Society upon the subject of
“ Phthisis in Victoria, and as the Committee kindly sent
“ me a copy of the Report some time since, which I
“ have carefully read, I have much pleasure in doing
“ so.
“ The Committee, it is evident, have taken great pains,
“ and have supplied some valuable information. I must
“ however confess that several of their conclusions I am
“ unable to agree with.
“ Comparisons respecting the death-rate from phthisis
“ in 1861 and 1871, whether they be made in respect to
“ the total death-rate or the death-rate at particular ages
“are, I hold, not fair; since 1861 was, with one excep-
“ tion (i 860), the year in which the highest death-rate
“ from that complaint has ever been shown by the
“returns; whilst 1871 was, with one exception (1868),
“ the year in which the returns show the lowest death-
“ rate from phthisis.
“ It is moreover questionable whether the returns for
“ 1861, or any year prior to it, are reliable as regards
“ the mortality from phthisis, for, until 1862 phthisis
“ was placed in the group with pneumonia, bronchitis


“ and other diseases of the respiratory system, and there
“ is reason to believe that many doubtful cases of lung
“ disease were classified as phthisis. From 1862 phthisis
“ has been classed as a constitutional disease, and great
“ care has been exercised to tabulate as such no cases
“ except those actually returned as of ‘ phthisis,’ or some
“ term equivalent to it.
“In regard to the summarised results at the end of
“ the Report, the second conclusion, affirming that the
“ rate of mortality from phthisis has been perceptibly
“ less of late years, appears to me to be not accordant
“ with facts. During the 15 years—lß62 to 1876 —respect-
“ ing which only reliable observations exist, the actual
“ rate has displayed very marked uniformity, whilst if,
“as there is no reason to doubt, persons at phthisical
“ ages have been gradually becoming fewer in propor-
“ tion to the whole population, the fact of the rate not
“ decreasing shows it has virtually been increasing.
“ With reference to the third conclusion, I believe it
“ will be generally conceded that arguments respecting
“ the fatality of phthisis based upon the alleged deaths
“ of children from that complaint are of little value, as
“it must, to say the least of it, be doubtful whether
“ the disease of which such children died was true
“ phthisis, and comparisons between 1861 and 1871 I
“ have already shown to be unfair.
“ The fourth conclusion is not borne out by facts. A
“ reference to the table at page 75 of the Victorian
“ Year Book, 1876-7, shows that 20 per cent, of the
“ deaths from phthisis which occurred in 1876 were of
“ Australians by birth.
“ The fifth conclusion is also shown to be erroneous
“by the same table. Only three per cent, of the deaths
“ from phthisis in 1876 were of persons who had been
in the colony less than one year, whilst 89 per cent.


“ had been there for more than five years, and 81 per
“cent, more than ten years prior to their death.
“ The sixth conclusion is based upon a comparison
“between 1861 and 1871, and therefore, as I have
«already shown, is of little or no value. Supposing,
“ however, the data to be reliable, I fail to see that the
“ proposition respecting the uniform rate of mortality
“ over the whole colony be owing to certain insanitary
“ conditions operating especially in Melbourne, is at all
“ proved.
“ Yours faithfully,
“ H. H. Hayter.
“ W. Thomson, Esq., F.R.C.S.
“ South Yarra.”
Having given the Government Statist his
opportunity, I now proceed to state my own
argument in my own way.
Compared with the total population, the
mortality from phthisis, in Victoria, continued
for many years very even. That evenness
showed the disease increasing. The popula-
tion at prone ages, 20 to 35» bad decreased
by 43,338 between the census of 1861 and
1871. It had multiplied not at these but
at younger ages. Immigrants had grown
old, no fresh arrivals filled their place, a
native race had not come up, while an
exodus in bad times took many to other


colonies. With the lowered number it was
thought phthisis would be less ; but the
disease rather increased, as numbers testify.
The unlooked-for loss of 43,338 young
adults was much commented on in the
press, in Parliament, debating social statics,
and was by me made to illustrate the medical
problem of phthisis in relation to climate.
An essayist following in my wake at the
Victorian Medical Society, replaced, on paper ,
the missing thousands, to set off colonial
against home communities. As well might
433,338 be made to magnify inequality. The
blunder reappears in Dobell’s Reports , 1877,
and may not again be let go unchallenged.
The lost 43,338 disturbed the balance by
leaving a larger share of children at non-
phthisical years. When deaths from phthisis
to the whole population were counted, they
seemed few by comparison with older
countries where relative ages were normal.
But another consideration of more concern
for the future of the colony is a probable
immunity from or proclivity to phthisis among
natives. Data for opinion are not given in


Victorian Year Books , being either overlooked
or thought not worth mention. Yet facts
reveal the working of an invariable law,
obtaining here as everywhere, that at all
sanitary stations for phthisical invalids, their
own people have or acquire a phthisical
(
tendency.
By this law a paradox daily occurs in
phthisical invalids going to and from the same
climate to recover from the same malady.
How climate could cause and cure identical
morbid states in a breath is not yet quite
theoretically understood ; and certainly it is
in this colony never practically exemplified.
But one effect might now be explained by
unalterable hereditary taint, or by specific
contagion. “Young consumptive townspeople,
“ who emigrate to the country, and there
“ recover and take up their abode, generally
“ marry, and,” says Dr. J. H. Bennet, “thus
“ inoculate an otherwise healthy country dis-
“ trict, as it were, with scrofula and consump-
“ tion.” Sir William Jenner has also observed
the same result in distant country localities.
Can Melbourne have been thus inoculated ?


The deaths from phthisis in Victoria for five
years ending 1869, and first six months of
1870, numbered 4259. of which on h 233, ° r
5-47 per cent., were natives. Continued inquiry
through successive years gave these results.

Here is a steady growth of fatal phthisis
among natives, from 5*47 to 2334 per cent.,
or nearly five-fold. The jump to 24*24 in 1875
will be shown due to measles, for it comes
out plainly in all the various tables as they
cross question one another.
The increase has to be considered along
with the number of natives grown from under
into phthisical years in the time. The
proportion is uncertain. Roughly calculated
by experts, it is thought unlikely to equal
the greater phthisis rate, and the following
estimates plainly indicate how far one rate
is from covering the other :

The total increase of persons born in
Victoria during the seventeen years between
1854 and 1871 was nearly 300,000. All of
these must have been born since 1854, and
consequently not one could in 1871 have
been more than seventeen years of age.
The only Victorians who could, at the census
of 1871, by any possibility have been over
seventeen years of age are those—amounting
to about 30,000 —enumerated in 1854, and
of these it is not at all likely that more
than 20,000 were alive and in the colony
in 1871. It is, therefore, certain that the
number of Victorian-born persons at phthisical
ages living in the colony in 1871 bore a very
small proportion indeed to the whole number
of Victorians contained in the population.
To make this part more complete the
following details are added; for as a demon-
stration of the proofs of a progressive increase
of phthisis among the native race hinges on
the proportion of deaths therefrom to the
numbers growing up, minute and careful cal-
culation is required where exact numbers are
unattainable.

The years 1861 and 1871, being census
years, yield exact numbers ; but for 1877,
the numbers of persons living at the specified
ages are “ estimated,” and “ must be taken
“ for what they are worth.” Yet they are
believed to be nearly correct, and are here
employed for vital, as they are elsewhere
utilized in social, statics. They show that
at those ages deaths from phthisis increased
from 11 per 10,000 living, to 16-21, a
remarkable and suggestive increment. If
those deaths were of young people coming
to the colony only to die, as has been
affirmed, their disease defied the invigorating
sea voyage and renovating climate. The vast
majority were probably native Australians.

born cannot yet be learned, the following is

Among Victorians there will obviously be a
very much larger proportion of young children
under phthisical ages than among persons
other than Victorians; who, moreover, include
all phthisical immigrants. This fully explains
the different ratios shown in the two tables,
without assuming any unknown immunity in
the one section, or special proclivity in the
other. The ages it is impossible to ascertain ;
but in a new colony only beginning to multiply
c 2


its native-born population in a geometrical
ratio, it is self-evident that young children
must largely outnumber young adults.
These facts demonstrate that at those ages,
when ordinary causes of phthisis, effective in
all other countries, come into active opera-
tion here, their action is not affected nor in
any way modified by climate.
It will probably be replied that many young
people from adjoining colonies have been
attracted to Melbourne for employment in
factories ; but this will only the more prove
the truth of the previous inference. Or, it
may be averred that many came to town
for medical advice, and remained to die.
But, in the entire absence of exact data
for such an opinion, it cannot be said to
rest upon a precise basis of fact ; while it
might be refuted by the equally tenable
opinion, that many young people who come
into town from the country to work in factories
or go into domestic service, and there contract
phthisis, return home to their relatives in the
country, and so relieve the aggregate town
mortality, and swell that of the country ; the


one source of fallacy probably thus correcting
the other, in Victoria as it has been found
to do in England and in other countries.
If the apparent town mortality be swelled
by people coming from the country to die
in city hospitals, as is often affirmed, then
relegating their cases back to the country
would add to its death-rate and lower that
of town, bringing both nearer an equality;
but it would also nullify the argument about
the greater salubrity of country air.
People coming from the country to be
medically treated for phthisis, and to remain
in town to die, most commonly belong to
the class who seek hospital aid in sickness.
During the years 1868 and 1869 the pro-
portion of native-born who died of phthisis in
the Melbourne Hospital to the total number
of deaths in that institution from the same
disease was nearly 7 per cent.; in the four
years ending 1874 it only rose up to io£
per cent., a rate not at all equal to the
general increase of deaths from phthisis
among the general population. Data later
than 1874 are not obtainable.

The total number of deaths in hospital
from phthisis during four years being 451,
the 47 deaths among Australians is about
io| per cent.
In offering these explanations, it is always
borne in mind that they are merely conjectures
of what is the probable interpretation of facts
which at present form a rather ugly blur
upon the social economy of a young people.
It may again be urged that the rate of
phthisis fatality in Victoria is low if compared


with that for England, a truth never doubted,
far less denied, though often said so by
critics who would not read before they
criticised, but trusted a second-hand mis-
quoter. This error is likewise repeated in
Dr. Dobell’s Reports , 1877, the local reporter
declining to rectify it after it was pointed
out. What had been averred was that at
certain ages “ neither Melbourne nor the
“ whole colony seem to have any vast advan-
“ tage over England in this comparison.”
But my critics insist that all ages were
included. It was also added that if things
went on as they were going, phthisis would
grow gradually worse, and facts now adduced
go far to verify the prediction.
Formerly, Melbourne and suburbs were
compared with England, because their area,
ten miles in diameter, is about equally
populous, phthisis being always co-related to
degrees of density. Taken in these relations,
Melbourne and suburbs, when compared
with England, rather than with any one of
its huge compactly-peopled cities, exhibits a
parallel. In the more thinly-populated rural


counties of England there often is less
phthisis to a given area than in sparsely-
peopled Victoria or Tasmania.
The comparison was originally made at page
45 of my essay, On Phthisis , in 1870. In Vic-
torian Year Books that comparison has been
several times paraphrased. No .stress was laid
on mere density per se 7 but on concomitants
of crowding in indoor trades and avocations
carried on under conditions likely to induce
or propagate phthisis. These trade defects
are fully discussed from pages 55 to 66. All
there remarked agrees with what Dr. William
Farr has since said about “ the greater
“ proximity of man to man the greater is
“ the mortality; ” or Mr. A. Haviland, of
the real source of phthisis in every village
being from overcrowding by people “ huddling
“togefher;” or Professor Ruehle, of the
“ now well established fact that the frequency
“of consumption increases with the density
“ of the population, and that, the world over,
“ the mortality from phthisis is greatest in
“ large cities, and that in these it is greatest
“in most thickly populated quarters.” More


of such non-climatic and purely personal influ-
ences operate in Melbourne than in the country,
hence the fair comparison.
The social circumstances of a small com-
munity, few unhealthy indoor trades, little
hemmed-in life, and plenty of wholesome
food for everybody, have again and again
been called mitigating agencies, irrespective
of a dry, sunny, out-inviting, often genial, and,
taken all in all, enjoyable climate.
The most important of the Medical Society’s
“ conclusions ” is that “ The reduction of the
“ mortality among young persons is to be
“ explained by a comparative immunity among
“ those born in the colony.”
The exact state of this part of the question
can now be shown by the following figures,
obtained from the Registrar-General, Mr. Gibbs,
custodian of the data, under whose super-
vision they were collated for me from the
general returns by Mr. Fenton, the most
experienced clerk in the vital statistics depart-
ment. The table would probably be found
another useful addition to the next Victorian
Year Book.

The estimated number of Victorians in the
mean population is given in the table at


page 18, with which the two tables on page
26 should be compared.
The exceptional increase and break of the
series of yearly increments in 1875 will pre-
sently be accounted for.
The above list only includes deaths regis-
tered as from “ Consumption,” “ Phthisis,”
and “ Haemoptysis,” but none from “ Tuber-
culosis,” the number of which on the return
amounted to 77 of the native-born ; and most
medical readers will be inclined to add them
as deaths from phthisis.
By the table it will be observed that in
1875 there were 249 deaths from phthisis
in Victoria among the native-born. This
number, it will also be observed, appears to
be about 70 more than the normal average
as compared with other years, before and
after that date. But that notable increase,
it must be remembered, followed immediately
after the great diademic of measles had spent
itself, leaving many cases of impaired health
from chronic lung disease. That many of
those deaths were due to the dregs of the
measles became more than ordinarily probable


from the fact that the City Coroner, Dr.
Richard Youl, an acutely observant member
of the medical profession, had to call the
attention of medical men to what appeared
to him to be an invasion of an entirely new
form of lung disease, which, because it often
seemed to linger dormant for the while, and
then, on some sudden exertion of the patient,
to start into activity, and cause sudden
unexpected death and coronial inquiry, he
proposed to term “ latent pneumonia.” His
error of etiology lay in failing to connect
pathologically, and therefore causatively, the
morbid anatomy of the lung as found by
dissection, with the primary eruptive fever
that had occurred in some instances five or
six months before, just as often happens in
pleuro-pneumonia of cattle. This oversight
was pointed out by me at the time of the
occurrence, and I now feel that my explan-
ation of the unusual disease was the correct
one, because this “ latent pneumonia ,” properly
so called, for it was latent, has no more
been heard of since measles vanished. These
deaths were added to the number of deaths


from phthisis, and so swelled the apparent
list of deaths from that disease for that year
of 1875, especially among the native-born,
among whom measles mostly prevailed; but
those deaths were properly due to measles,
and had it not been for that fatal diademic
the year would have shown in order with
its steady increase from phthisis proper, in
regular series. These extra deaths from latent
lung disease left after measles seem to have
been set down to phthisis chiefly in the
country; for, as appears in the table, the
number of deaths ascribed to phthisis in
Melbourne and suburbs, was, in 1875, rather
below than above an average. Probably many
who were prone to phthisis died of measles
pneumonia, and their deaths were in Mel-
bourne so recorded, leaving there the number
from phthisis less than usual.
The ratio of phthisis among the native-born
white population rose gradually from 12 per
cent, of the total deaths from phthisis in
1871, to 23 per cent, in 1877. Whether this
increased ratio corresponds to the increase of
native-born persons in the mean population,


or not, cannot be known before next census,
1881. Meanwhile the steady increase gives
no warrant whatever to affirm that the young
native-born white adult enjoys in this colony
an immunity from phthisis.
Indeed, a contrary belief is strengthened by
the numbers who died of phthisis in Melbourne
and suburbs during the year 1878.

Of the 580 deaths from phthisis in Mel-
bourne and Suburbs, 146, or 25 per cent., were
of persons born in Victoria ; and 180, or 31
1
per cent., of natives of all Australasia. These
are proportions far beyond the dream of the


Medical Society, or that body never could
have sanctioned publication of their report.
The annual increase of phthisis in the city
and suburbs is further shown by the number
of deaths of adults from all causes, and from
phthisis, at ages between 20 and 35, in 1878 :
Deaths from all Causes, and from Phthisis, at
AGES FROM 20 tO 35, IN 1878.
Total. From Phthisis. Ratio,

On comparing these with the numbers on
page 2, it will be observed that the total
deaths rose from 616 in 1877 to 626 in 1878,
while the deaths from phthisis increased from
224 in 1877 to 234 in 1878, or under each
head by 10; and that the total increase was
therefore due to the phthisis increment.
This great increase coincides with the rapid
increase of deaths from phthisis among natives.
That it cannot in any material degree be
explained away by deaths of young phthisical
adults coming into the colony in a dying state
from abroad, will anon be demonstrated.
“In England and Wales the mortality
“ from phthisis in 1874 was at the rate of


“ 21*04, and in 1875 of 22*24 per 10,000
“ persons living. In Scotland, in 1873, the
“ death-rate from the same complaint was 24*6
“ per 10,000 living. In Ireland, during 1875,
“ it was 19*29, and in the previous ten years
“it averaged 18*52 per 10,000 living. All
“ these rates are higher than those in Vic-
“ toria.” But they equal those in Melbourne
and Suburbs, as shown by the next tables.

Before explaining how these new found facts
confute the old climatic theory, I shall meet
an objection —frivolous, yet notable—to my
proofs of the progress of phthisis among
Australian natives.
The Medical Society profess to think “it
“is easy to show, as has been done ” by
the writer alone —“that in successive years
D


“there is a larger proportion of native-born
“ persons among those dying of phthisis; but
“ a mere list of that sort is valueless for the
“ purpose of proving a growing tendency to
“ phthisical disease, unless it can be shown
“that the increase is greater than the
“ increase of native-born persons in the
“ population. This cannot be the case, since
“ the mortality among young persons, who are
“ now almost all native-born, has diminished.
“As they advance into the ages above 20, at
“ which the disease becomes most fatal, they
“ must more rapidly constitute a larger
“ element in the lists of deaths from con-
“ sumption.”
But this native element, even at fatal
ages, ought not to yield so great results
if they really enjoyed the alleged immunity.
In them the malady must be as among
inhabitants of other countries, when brought
under the action of its exciting causes. The
Society’s admission concedes the point by
begging the question. For twenty years there
appeared an immunity, until Australians grew
into the natural law of phthisical causation.


On entering the time of life they leave
immunity behind. Nothing could be more
conclusive.
And yet another effort is made to nullify
the proof, by saying how “well it speaks for
“ the vigour of the Victorian-born portion of
“ the population, that in 1871 only 72 deaths
“ from phthisis, out of a total of 841,
“ occurred amongst them, whilst they formed
“ 329,597 out of a total population of
“731,528.”
But why did the Medical Society halt at
1871 ? They were very well aware that in
1871 few native-born had reached what all
admit to be the fatal age of 20 years, and
know that every later year has brought more
into the prone period, and therefore affording
means for fair comparison. But the Medical
Society did not avail themselves of that
opportunity, halting where inquiry ought to
have began. In December 1877, they would
have been “ glad to know if in 1871 there
“ was more phthisis in the colony than in
“1876;” because they “could not get this
information from Mr. Hayter.” Obtaining
d 2


from me what time, trouble, and tact might
have got for themselves, unfiltered through
any one, they have now an opportunity of
turning the desiderated data to fruitful argu-
ment, and satisfy their minds of their own
error of judgment. To this end the annexed
abstract of table at page 18 may contribute.

Here is a ratio all but doubled of deaths
from phthisis among the native population ;
and rising from io per cent, in 1871, to
23*34 per cent, in 1877, of the total deaths
from phthisis, as shown on page 14, and that
too in a total death-rate from phthisis
increasing from year to year.
Of the ages nothing is known, beyond able
statists’ conjecture that they are not likely


to cover the increase from phthisis. And
although 4*40 deaths from that disease may
seem a small number in 10,000 persons, it
must not be forgotten that in these were a
very large proportion of little-liable children.
It is also noticeable that the number 72,
given by the Society, is understated, the
correct number being 81. If it had been only
72 the contrast would have been greater.
To a remark about “ the great immunity
“ of the native-born being very encouraging,”
it was replied, “ that Dr. Hall, of Hobart
“ Town, had published a valuable report upon
“ that part of the subject.”
The Tasmanian, like the Victorian, Report ,
was not on aetiology, but glorified the colony
and extolled its climate. It angrily replied to
my remarks, and this is my rejoinder.
Proof is here given that Tasmanian youth
die phthisical in Victoria. In these fatal cases
the complaint could not have been brought from
England, but must have inhered, or been caught
in Victoria. All the 30 Tasmanians who died
of phthisis in Victoria, in 1877, were over 20
years of age. Neither Tasmanian nor Victoriaa


air eradicates struma; nor confers immunity
from phthisis. Climate cannot alter diathesis,
however that occult morbid state may be
defined, or physiologically expounded ; and no
pathologist has yet succeeded in giving it a
definition.
Hence it would not appear so easy to show,
even after it has been done, as is assumed by
imitative demonstrators, of whom The Critic
of Pure Reason might say, “ Men who never
“ think independently have nevertheless the
“ acuteness to discover everything, after it has
“ been shown them, in what was said long
“since, though no one ever saw it there
“ before.”
But it must now be evident that among
Australasian youth there is, from phthisis,
neither moderate mortality nor innate
immunity.


ON THE EXTENT OF INDIGENOUS
AND OF IMPORTED PHTHISIS
Next in importance among the Medical
Society’s “conclusions” is the sth, affirming
that “the apparent increase of mortality
“ among young adults is due to the influx
“ of phthisical persons from abroad.”
To meet this sweeping assertion and prove
it at variance with fact, the following table,
similar to one ' given by me in 1871, is
reprinted from last Victorian Year Book ,
1877-8, merely altering for. convenience by
combining the numbers of the sexes into one
group, instead of having them apart as in the
Victorian Year Book .
This table shows the number who died of
phthisis in Victoria, in 1877, also the duration
of their illness contrasted with the length of
time they had lived in the Australasian
colonies: —

“ the complaint, thereby proving that the
“ latter had been contracted in Australasia.
“ Thus of the 593 deaths of persons born
“ outside the Australasian colonies, respect-
“ ing which full particulars are specified, as
“ many as 569, or 96 per cent., contracted
“ the disease in Australasia, and no more
“ than 24, or 4 per cent., contracted it
“ elsewhere.”
It will also be observed that of the 243 or
22 per cent, so omitted, particulars alone of
duration of illness is wanting. Only 18 of
them had lived less than 5 to 10 years in the
colony. The remaining 225 had all been over
sto 10 years resident. They too may have
been old consumptives, a doubt of which the


climate may take the benefit ; but against the
surmise is the certainty that deaths of those
of whom particulars are found add no colour
of probability to the conjecture.
The table showing the duration of illness
in connection with the period of residence
in Australasian colonies is now adopted for
the first time in the Victorian Year Book for
1877-8. The same table showing the same
points was originally published in my “ Digest ,
&c., &c .,” in 1871, when the average length of
residence of those who died of phthisis was
ascertained to have been about 11 years, .while
the duration of their illness had only been
about a year and a half, and nearly the same
proportions obtain still.
It is gratifying to know that an official
beginning has at length been made with the
only means of settling a long-vexed question ;
and it is to be hoped that all concerned in
death-registrations may now be particular
in ascertaining exact facts of residence and
duration of illness in persons dying of phthisis,
to enable the Statist to continue his good
work. Hitherto the deputy-registrars have


been careful, the members of the medical
profession being alone remiss with their part
of the double duty. No doubt it is a much
simpler matter to find the length of time in
which any one has lived in the colony than
that in which the same person may have
been ill of phthisis ; yet surely a near enough
approximation could in most cases be reached
so as not to leave nearly a fourth part
undetermined.
Of travelled invalids claiming to have derived
benefit from living in Australasia, clinical
report tells nothing. Except a few desultory
writings replying to mine, no objective study
has been given to the work in purely clinical
histories. The great fault found with me was
that I had not detailed individual cases ; but
neither have my opponents. I preferred to
depend upon public statistics, and they wisely
follow my example. “ The statistical was the
“ only ground-work upon which they could
“ satisfactorily base a report. Anything further
“ would be but matter of opinion,” justly
remarked the gentleman who presented the
Report to the Society. That “it would not


“do to strongly recommend the climate on
“ the strength of any array of individually -
“ collected facts,” was the only other sensible
remark throughout the whole discussion that
followed.
For many years no one in England or
Australia has recounted cases proving by
results the effect of residence in Victoria on
phthisical people who came hither for
health. Members of the profession assembled
at the special meeting of the Medical Society,
for the ostensible purpose of deliberating on
the report of their select committee of inquiry;
yet retired without taking the fine opportunity
to offer a word of comment. At a critical
juncture all were reserved and guarded, waiting
to hear what would be said of it in England,
and tacitly ratifying statements they will ere
long regret to acknowledge.
One of their number lately wrote an ear-
pricking letter to the Lancet , telling how
wonderfully the climate improved his own
broken health ; but before the ink was hardly
dry he was off to the hopefully better clime
at the Cape. Of the host of phthisical


doctors who were at one time boastfully said
to be working hard at practice, and the
“ cloud of witnesses ” in divines vigorously
preaching, of whom climatic enthusiasts wrote
rapturously, where are they now ? Have
not they all succumbed to phthisis within the
five years which our tables show to be the
limit to the imported disease ?
One Socratic arguer “ would be glad to
“ know the number of young adults who died
“ after arrival from 1861 to 1871.” A reply
was promised “at an early day.” But a
year and a half have gone in wasting time,
and reply has not come yet. If it were true
“ that phthisical persons who came to this
“ colony had a better chance of living than if
“ they staid at home,” why has their coming
been made to account for an “ absurdly high
phthisical death-rate ” ? The points do not
agree, and the inquiry vainly hoped to have
been “ settled twelve years ago ” will have to
be resumed.
Alluding to an every-day practice in the
modern climatic treatment of phthisis, Dr.
J. H, Bennett, so recently as 1878, says he is


constantly advising phthisical patients to settle
in Australia, but nowhere in his volume is to
be found one word about the result; and we
are now no better informed thereon than when
his namesake, the late Professor J. Hughes
Bennett, wrote eight years ago about one
young person whom he had sent to Australia,
but whose clinical history he had been unable
to trace.
In The Practitioner, the therapeutic power
of sea-voyaging and residence in Australian
climates in phthisis receives great attention
in an exhaustive series of papers on general
climatology; and the author promises to give
details about the mode of living suitable for
phthisical invalids in this colony. And while
criticism must be reserved until the advice
be given, it may yet be remarked that,
as Dr. Faber never resided during a single
cycle of the seasons in Australia, his opinion
must necessarily be to some extent deductive
and conjectural. But we have already found
how fallacious it is to infer what ought to
be the effect on invalids from living under
certain climatic conditions; where everything


about climate is minutely described, but not
a word about patients.
Nor is it alone those who wrote books and
papers before acquiring actual experience of
the effect of residence who fall into the a
priori error. Thus, the Registrar-General of
Queensland, in the “ Vital Statistics , 1877,”
after alluding to the high death-rate from
phthisis in Melbourne and suburbs as equalling
that of England, adds “ doubtless the sudden
“ changes to which Victoria may be specially
“ subject are unfavourable to persons suffering
“ from pulmonary diseases, but, apart from
“ this, there can be no doubt that the warm
“ and dry Australian climate is much more
“ favourable to persons of consumptive habit
“ than most of the countries of Northern
“ Europe, though it is admitted that the
“ prevalence of phthisis in England is largely
“ attributable to the occupations in which
“ great numbers are engaged.”
To these remarks it may be replied, that
the last two years in Australia have been
amongst the driest and warmest seasons on
record, and yet both years were the most


fatal years for phthisis which Victorians have
ever had ; while it may be further observed,
that in Melbourne and suburbs all kinds of
factory, work-room, trading, and in-door life
are, under a protective fiscal policy, rapidly
multiplying, bringing town life to a parallel
with life in England, affording another proof
of the fallacy of the old climatic theory.
Of Queensland it was also said that phthisis
rates at Brisbane equal those at Melbourne,
or 20*6 in 10,000 living; but the Queensland
Report itself shows, p. xxxii, only 12-35 ; with
which the figures in the Australian Medical
Journal , Dec. 1877, p. 375> do not a S ree - In
sooth, in the Medical Society’s Report , and
the debate following on it, there is not one
solitary reliable figure.
The result of the Medical Society’s delibera-
tions on the curabililty of phthisis may be
briefly given in their naive remark —“ It is
“ certain that many phthisical persons claim
“to have received benefit from residence in
“ the colony.” Not clinical work, but sickly
feeling, formed their opinion about ever
fickle, always hopeful, unstoical phthisis !


It is popularly believed and medically
affirmed that the high phthisical death-rate
in Melbourne mainly comes from the place
being an entrepot for that class of invalids
who flock to it, and too often tarry there to
die. The following additional details, however,
still further show the exact extent of this
immigration to be quite unequal to the full
explanation, and altogether opposed to the
prevailing opinion of climatic theorists.

Of 1 »955 w h° died of phthisis in Victoria
during 1876 and 1877, 445, or 23 per cent.,
were born in Australasia ; 1,354, or 69 per
cent., had resided upwards of five years; 72,
or 4 per cent., upwards of two years; and
only 84, or about 4 per cent., less than two
years.
Even if all the 143 unnoted deaths could
be added to the list of recent arrivals, that
is within two years, 84 in number, which is
hardly likely since the circumstances of new
colonists are generally readily known, they yet
would only raise the proportion to lo‘B per
cent, of the total number in the two years.
That there is a fallacy in the ordinary
interpretation of the high Melbourne fatality
is suggested by the kind of efforts made to
offer it a double explanation, first, from the
insanitary conditions of the city, and secondly,
from the arrival of incomers in a dying con-
dition. If the latter reason be the true one,
it would follow that the city cannot be so
insalubrious to dwell in ; although from the
fact of these immigrants dying so frequently,
Melbourne and Suburbs would not appear to


maintain their former repute of being “ all in
“ all the best place in the world for consump-
“ tives, in all stages of the disease,” except
as a convenient spot to bring their sorrows
to an end. A full analysis of the figures
gives a fair idea of the operation of the two
factors; and both are alike antagonistic to
the belief in st climatic influence, causative or
curative, being in any degree at work, leaving
alone the efficient all-sufficing personal con-
ditions in individual constitution and manner
of life. Of these, many of the more active
were enumerated in the original Essay and
need not again be here recapitulated, agreeing
as they do with the views of many of the
ablest expounders of the etiology of phthisis
who have since then written.
As it was never affirmed that phthisis
mortality in Victoria equalled that in England,
a negative was not required to be “ incontro-
vertibly demonstrated.” Such supererogatory
work could only be gone about by persons
unable to keep before their minds the basis
of a discussion. All ever averred, and
now contended for is, that in Melbourne
E 2


and Suburbs the higher rate prevails. The
Medical Society frankly admit “it is not
“ disputed that the rate of mortality from
“ phthisis is considerably lower in Victoria
“than in England;” and herein retract what
they before alleged. In Dobell’s Report alone
is it still said, “ Mr. William Thomson, of
“ South Yarra, has endeavoured to prove, by
“ the aid of statistics, ‘ that tubercular con-
“ ‘ sumption is increasing in Victoria, and is
“ ‘ as general and fatal in it as in England.’ ”
The two reports, from the same reporter,
do not agree. The sentence in turned commas
cannot be got in anything I ever wrote, nor
is the gist inferable. Nay, I have even been
called “disingenuous” for taking a big town
full of jails, hospitals, factories, taverns,
theatres and iniquity, to make good a case
against the colony. In literary work fair
quotation is “the very pink of courtesy.”
Nor were conditions of difference between
town and country ignored, but held ever
potent, phthisis being found less common
away inland, where few work or live indoor,
with ample fare for everybody.


But it was also shown that when the disease
does occur inland, it passes through every
phase as in town, unaffected by climate. “In
“ how far the climate of Victoria is such as
“ to contribute, along with these and other
“ circumstances, to the reduction of phthisis
“ mortality, is a much disputed point.”
The writer is the only disputant. But his
writings, at first contemned as polemical, are
from year to year in Victorian Year Books
well corroborated. In controverting him the
Medical Society of Victoria aim to hinder
credence of views “ calculated to involve the
“ character of the climate in the opinion of
“ intending emigrants from Europe.”
But what have members of a scientific
society discussing processes of disease to do
with hopes and fears of intending emigrants ?
The rapid growth of a new colony in a pecu-
liar climate offered rare facility for inquiring
anew into a doubtful point in phthisis etiology;
and the opportunity was not to be lost through
idle dread of some possible remote consequence..
Climate is the element to eliminate before
bringing the phthisis factor into relief. By


the method of exclusion I have all along
worked, and shall continue to do so, as the
logical method of verifying inference.
If the phrase “ a small population ” imply
a thinly peopled country, then, in density must
be found the essential. Not the mere fact
about people living near one another, but the
way in which they do so live creates the
phthisis factor. “ Within certain limits there
“i£ a definite relation between density of
“ population and mortality,” wrote lately Dr.
William Farr. And Mr. Haviland, comparing
high and dry North Wales with wet Lincoln-
shire, to test the damp-soil theory, found in a
midland county, sheltered from sea-storm, “the
“ real source of mischief in abundant evidence
“ of overcrowding, where people huddle together
“ for warmth or company.” Packing within
the home in hamlet or village, on a thinly
peopled country, leads to error about density
and its accompanying yet non-essential evils.
As Professor Paget, of Cambridge, lately well
observed, it is the kind of air, within the
dwelling rather than the atmosphere outside
that brought on phthisis ; a view ably advocated


in Dr. Mac Cormack’s work on the effects of
breathing pre-breathed air.
The greater prevalence of these faults of
daily life in and around Melbourne than away
in the ypen bush, made me compare the city
with its cluster of crowded towns, and inter-
vening country districts, with all England, in
a general way. Straggling Melbourne, over
sixty miles in circumference, with many of
its minor towns ten miles apart, and open
thinly-built fields between, cannot fairly be
likened to huge London, compact New York,
compressed Liverpool, or gregarious Glasgow.
The attempt would be preposterous. The
wider is the better criterion, and for the very
reasons approved that made it selected in the
essay, To the arguments then given at
page 44, in favour of it, there is now nothing
more to add, beyond the fact that as a testing
point it is still adhered to. Indeed, it appears
so fair and facile that anyone well may wonder
why it was not earlier made his own. But
that need be no cause of outrageous jealousy.
Had data been freely allowed me for the
whole colony, as well as for the central


district, inquiry would have included bleak
Ballarat, high-levelled and inland; glaring
Bendigo, beyond the dividing range ; and
litoral Geelong, open to the sea air, yet
sheltered from the “ dynamic force ” of
southernly gales to which Melbourne is at all
seasons so exposed. Thus might the potency
have been singled out at those centres of
industry, to find in what degree it was indoor,
or climatic. By then comparing Melbourne
and inland towns with wholly rural districts,
later contrasts might have been obviated.
Unluckily the subject was not popular.
Under an entirely mistaken idea of the purpose
of the inquiry, the investigation was, by the
minister of the day, limited to the metropolis.
“ State archives were not to be let settle a
t
“ doctor’s squabble.” The plea held good until
an order in Parliament overcame objection.
Thus was I on one hand accused of a
sinister motive in asking for statistics of the
whole colony; and on the other, by thought-
less critics, roundly abused for “disingenuously
“ confining research to workshops, jails, and
“ hospitals, the better to make good a specious


“argument” against climate and colony. Nay
a charge was even levelled in a religious
journal at the writer for having “ written a
“ book to curse his enemies.” The reverend
critic forgot that every effort to stay disease or
heal the sick has a divine warrant; and that
the Great Physician himself had to rebuke
the Pharisee hindering clinical work.
It is little wonderful, therefore, to find
speakers at the Medical Society, when espousing
the non-climatic view, protesting against being
thought disparaging the colony. Consciousness
of truth needs no apology. Of unadorned
utterances about “ manipulated figures,” “ dis-
“ paraging slanders on the colony,” and other
magniloquent betise in unsophisticated debate,
no more need be said than this, in reply
to one remark about a “ theory invented first,
“ and then facts made to square with it,”
that the facts now adduced must convince
the curt doubter, who cuts debate by a quip,
of their being genuine, found ready to hand,
needing no touch of artful chiseling, gathered
and told neither to entice nor deter invalids,
nor abet any other pious fraud, but only to


learn whether climate did or did not affect
phthisis. The query was novel, and “by no
“ means in consonance with the general
“experience of medical men;” yet it was
none the less open to inductive proof, by
“ statistics bearing incontrovertible evidence of
“ truthfulness and correctness,” such as mine
now bear, and always have borne.
Towards verifying them the Medical Society
of Victoria largely contribute by steady
encouragement of opposition. By this con-
tinual friction, truth has been keenly tempered
to drill through dense stolidity, until that
medical Mimir’s Well, the strong-room of the
Registrar-General, has been tapped to allow
a free flow of pent-up vital facts illustrative
of the negative effect of climate on phthisis.
Moreover, a department has thus been
educated to appreciate the live value of buried
documents, in making the dead give life to
the living; and learn how figures that are
dormant when kept in a heap, can, when
spread about, fertilise the field of medical
knowledge. Coin and blood globules are only
useful in circulating currents.


Whatever success has been thus achieved
is due to varying degrees of phthisis found
in town and country. Than the authors cited,
none are better qualified by special study to
offer an opinion on the effect of large-town
life on phthisis ; and I adhere to a mode of
working out the problem by methods so
corroborated. Ruehle followed Niemeyer, who
recalled the neglected work of Addison, and
the inflammatory doctrine, now, in opposition
to their formerly believed diathetic of Lsennec,
adopted by our local etiologists, after reading
works written since I drew for them the
offending comparison.
In adopting the crowding criterion, I am
further justified by everyone now allowing the
phthisical mortality of Melbourne to be on a
par with that of England, an admission
unaffected by the explanation that “ some
“ exceptional circumstances must have come
“ into play to bring about such an absurdly
“ high figure.” It is sagely averred that
“if exceptional circumstances were absent,”
colonial town-life would be more natural.
The same might be equally predicated of the


bad parts of England, and her hospital towns,
where invalids congregate. If exceptional
circumstance went to the bush, and built a
few big trading towns and villages crowded
with indoor workers, there would phthisis
follow. Melbourne once was bush, and at the
ha PPy time was free from exceptional circum-
stance and phthisis. The reductio ad absurdum
seems the only way to reach fatuity writing
nonsense about an “ absurdly high figure,”
when alluding to a death-rate, as if it were
a comicality. It needs no philosophy to teach
how everywhere “ the exceptional circum-
stance,” i.e., the insanitary condition of life,
personal or social, makes all the difference
between healthy and sickly towns in diseases
not endemic, to which category phthisis does
not belong. When conditions work, climate
cannot counteract them.
Many have written about the evil effect of
damp soil in other towns; but none have
explored the piled cottages at lake-like villages
around Melbourne. Whether they give more
phthisis than higher and drier built dwellings
is unknown, because never investigated. They


are occupied by indoor workers. By them,
the damp-soil theory has not been tested.
Only in a credulous dilettanti fashion, not in
a practical way, has that favourite theory
been here discussed.
Here then are all the facts of our urban
life “ quite in accordance with the general
“ law which obtains throughout the country
“ (England), viz., that however excellent site,
“ soil, elevation, and climate may be, all can
“be neutralised by crowding human beings
“ into an inadequate space, and giving full
“ scope to indulge in their hereditary or
“ acquired fondness for filth.”
In further deciding that phthisis depends on
social rather than climatic causes, Mr.
Haviland, in the Geography of Phthisis , &c.,
1875, concludes, “ The climate, therefore, per
“ se , cannot be considered an exciting cause,
“ however greatly predisposed to phthisis the
“ people may be.”
Therein the ablest medical topographer in
England has come, by minute induction, to
affirm the proposition with which our local
controversy over ten years ago began. With


that citation it might now be allowed
handsomely to conclude.
The exceptional circumstances of individual
and social life in England or Australia alike
operate to induce phthisis irrespective of
climate.
But damp-soil theorists were not content
to advocate their views by borrowed illustra-
tions, rather than from facts lying before their
own doors. They set off their hypothesis by
the contrast of an alleged immunity from the
disease among people living at high altitudes ;
and inferred that such localities would therefore
prove good sanatoria for our own consump-
tives. Even Baron von Mueller has been led
away by enthusiasm for fragrant gum tree
foliage to advocate the reservation of
eucalypti-clad hills as sanitarian retreats for
invalids made phthisical by Melbourne
u exceptional conditions.” The learned savant
never proved the efficacy of the balmy air by
actual trial, but merely thought that might
occur by what was said to have happened on
the pine-clad hills of Switzerland. But if the
latter effect has been illusory, the analogy


would also fail. Upon this point the following
account of the latest investigations of the
matter will afford for us some applicable
information. The citation is from Dr. J. H.
Bennett, On Consumption , 1878.
“ In the course of my summer’s researches,”
says Dr. Bennett, “ I met with a recently
“ published and very interesting work by Dr.
“ Emil Muller, of Winterthur, entitled, Der
“ Verbreitung der Lungenschwindsucht in der
“ Schweiz , 1876. It is principally statistical,
“ and gives an elaborate account of the
“ mortality from Phthisis in Switzerland
“ generally. Amongst the tables at the end
“ are a series giving the average mortality
“ from Phthisis at different mountain eleva-
“ tions, calculated on data furnished by a
“ considerable number of localities.
“ The average mortality at different eleva-
tions is given in three heads: —1. In persons
“ whose occupations were purely industrial,
“ principally watch and lace making, entailing
“ confinement in workshops or at home;
“2. In persons whose occupations were partly
“ industrial, partly agricultural; 3. In persons


“ whose occupations were purely agricultural.

“ These tables are very instructive, and
entirely negative the statements so often
“ made of late y ears » that there is any special
“immunity from Phthisis in the mountain
“ regions of Switzerland. They show that a
“ certain proportion of the general population
‘ in the higher mountain regions die, as else-


“ where, from Phthisis, the rate depending on
“ occupations in life. Industrial pursuits,
“ carried on indoors, in consequence, give a
“ death-rate of 10*2, Io'2, 47, 6*5, 9*B, 77
“ per cent., according, no doubt, to the nature
“of the occupation. One of the highest
“ factors, 9*B, is at an elevation of from 3400
“to 4400 feet. At 4400 to 5000 feet, in
“ mixed labour (partly workshop, partly agri-
cultural), the death-rate from Phthisis is 77.”
Dr. Bennett, as we ought to do, adds:—
“This is the lesson we learn in the plains,
“in all latitudes, in the north as well as in
“ the south. The mortality of phthisis rises
“in cities 'in all pursuits necessitating an
“ indoor life —that is, with those with whom
“ respiration is defective, with whom oxygen
“ food is deficient. It rises according to
“ the degree of closeness and to the nature
“of the concomitants. It falls in the country,
“ in pursuits carried out in the open air, with
“ perfect physiological respiration; would fall
“ still more were not the night habitations
“ generally close and unhealthy, even in the
“ country.”
F


All this accords with and confirms every
word spoken or written by me during the
last quarter of a century about the fancied
influence of Victorian climates over phthisis.
The so-called exceptional circumstance of city
life has profusely furnished proofs of the
accuracy of my early and lately expressed
views, founded as they were upon strangely
neglected facts.
Of Dr. Hermann Weber’s work on the
effect of Alpine regions in that disease, the
late Professor Parkes, in the best book on
hygiene ever published, says : —“ Although on
“ the Alps, phthisis is arrested in strangers,
“in many places the Swiss women on the
“ lower heights suffer greatly from it ; the
“ cause is a social one ; the women employed
“ in making embroidery congregate all day in
u small, ill-ventilated, low rooms, where they
11 are often obliged to be in a constrained
“ position ; their food is poor in quality.
“ Scrofula is very common. The men, who
“ an open air life, are exempt; therefore,
“ the very place where strangers are
“ £ ettin g well of phthisis, the natives die


“ from it—another instance that we must
“ look to local conditions and social habits
“ for the great cause of phthisis. It would
“ even seem possible that, after all, it is not
“ indeed elevation and rarefaction of air, but
“ simply plenty of fresh air and exercise,
“ which are the great agents in the cure of
“ phthisis.” The latter is probably the truer
account. Practical Hygiene , 1878, p. 440.
In the same volume, the author, writing on
varying degrees of phthisis among troops,
asks, “ what are the causes of this phthisical
“ excess ? The phthisis was not owing to
“ climate, for that is unchanged. There is
“ only one condition common to all which
“ seems capable of explaining it —overcrowding.
“ The breathing the foul barrack atmosphere
“ was the principal, perhaps the only, cause
“ of this great mortality from lung diseases.”
To that conclusion it is added, “ The
“ production of phthisis from impure air (aided
“ most potently, as it often is, by coincident
“ conditions of want of exercise, want of
“ good food, and excessive work) is no new
“ doctrine.”
F 2


In Melbourne and its suburbs the old
doctrine only finds new application.
It would hence appear inverting the order
of procedure to form a sanatorium on some
eucalypti covered hill for lungs diseased by
town “ exceptional circumstance.” It places
curative before preventive treatment; the
medical in lieu of the hygienic; but it also
admits the existence of phthisis, which was
denied. Explanation implies confession.
A more rational scheme, from a sanitary
rather than a medical point of view, would
aim to alter the exceptional conditions of
town life, so fertile in phthisis causation.
When these conditions are found irremovable,
invalids may be invited to seek healing
eucalyptirie vapour ; if indeed that benign
effluence be not after all found no better than
another idolum specus , or laboratory phantom.
As far as information guides judgment, the
effect is a myth. Under evergreen exhaling
boughs in the native forest superstition is
less fervid than with credulous Spanish
peasant wearing a leaflet on the neck.
Unless charms be more effective than reality,


both are alike impotent against typhoid fever,
or phthisis. The wide running roots of a tree,
so greedy of moisture, may drink a marsh dry
and thus check the growth of algae that are
supposed to form ague malaria ; but against
the other two diseases named, so common
here, and arising from so entirely different
causes, every day experience proves the
agreeable aroma of the gum tree worthless.
On all these matters the most concerned
laity are as sorry theorists as are medical
advocates of popular etiology. Neither go
round the subject, but quietly look on the
sunny side.
Climate none can modify for personal wants;
but, while deprecating utopian schemes for
impracticable cities of Hygieia, urging a
clearer knowledge of individual errors that in
aggregate swell a death rate, must better
regulate their removal, and make healthy
life possible for everybody. Ordinary toilers in
a metropolis aiming to become the workshop
of a continent might well be taught how it
is not the handicraft nor the desk work, but
the way in which they are conducted, that


brings into play the active agent in phthisis.
Nor is it valid argument to affirm that a
general immunity from inflammatory affections
of the lungs denotes a like freedom from
phthisis, seeing how the former often prevails
in inverse ratio to the latter.
Whatever the “ something,” hitherto eluding
aided or unaided vision, or pathological imagi-
nation, that makes pneumonia tend in one
person more than in another, or indeed in
some people not at all, to end in phthisis,
may be, it is at any rate gratifying to find a
growing opinion in favour of viewing phthisis
often as a sequel of former lesions than
always a primary systemic or pulmonary morbid
state. When first that opinion was offered
here the writer was invidiously reviewed as
“ one of those who applied the term phthisis
“ to a group of secondary pathological states,”
and not merely to a certain result of prolonged
errors of nutrition. Reaction favours the
more thorough, though at one period thought
peculiar, etiology.
But when it is said to be “ now recognised
“that most cases of phthisis represent really


“ the final stage of some acute inflammatory
“ affection, generally pneumonia,” a more
definite statement might be added, of the kind
of pneumonia that is prone to that termi-
nation. A medical society discussing a purely
pathological topic need not fear to employ
appropriate technicality, without which it is
indeed impossible to proceed free from peri-
phrase or ambiguity ; and more particularly
in framing a Report ostensibly intended for
scientific readers, rather than for popular
perusal.
If, then, it be neither the atmosphere over
the roof, nor the ground under the foundation,
but altogether air within the domicile that
contains the efficient cause of phthisis, the
potent agent is so far brought nearer ultimate
analysis. Let us therefore try to follow to its
lair this hiding evil, in croupous or catarrhal
pneumonia, imperfect physiological respiration,
scrofula, impaired nutrition, or other malady
or defect with which it is usually coupled.
Without adding a word more than need
be on the relations which pneumonia, bron-
chitis, and tubercle bear to phthisis, a remark


may here be offered on the nature of the
infecting particle, now admitted to be the
special irritant, carried along lymphatic canals
from deposits in the lungs or othei* parts of
the body to set up morbid action within the
air chambers that end in that disease.
In his recent lectures, Dr. J. Henry Green
describes nodules as formed by epithelium
accumulated within the alveoli, and containing
cells resembling leucocytes, and granular or
amorphous material, but he cannot speak
with certainty of their exact nature. Of the
“ circumstances that tend to make an inflam-
“ matory product infective, we are at present
“ ignorant. They may possibly be connected
“with atmospheric influences, or with certain
“ undefined conditions of the organism.”
In incertitude speculation seemed allow-
able ; hence my venture to conjecture how a
nodule may be formed within an air vesicle
by compact debris of epithelium left there
after it had been blighted by being deprived
of its protoplasm by the action of micro-
cocci, in which case the giant cells and
other constituents would be relics and not


products by increased cell growth. To that
view nothing in Dr. Green’s description is
contradictory. On the contrary, it agrees
with the progressive character assigned by
that eminent pathologist to true phthisis.
Generally, the changes met with in the
lungs in pulmonary phthisis are essentially
similar histologically to those which occur
in acute miliary tuberculosis, an admittedly
infective disease.
May not their analogy go further, and
accept phthisis as equally infective ? In
phthisis, as in tuberculosis, the large nucle-
ated elements in the alveoli are evidently
the offspring of the epithelial cells which
line the alveolar cavities, and they, too, are
always associated with granular material and
leucocytes. These contents of the air chamber
are accompanied by infiltration of the alveolar
wall, a change in its adenoid tissue probably
induced in the first instance by the irritant
or infective particle acting on the protoplasm
of the epithelium of the air vesicle; rather
than in inter-alveolar tissue, as was until
lately held by many eminent pathologists.


Here, then, there so far appears to be a
connected series of morbid actions all directly
connected with specific infection ; and the
question will naturally arise, can they be
traced a step even further back ? Dr. Green
says, “In describing the several lesions as
“ inflammatory, I would again repeat that I
“ merely mean to imply that they owe their
“ origin to some kind of injurious irritation of
“ the pulmonary tissues.” When infection
becomes an auxiliary in the production of
phthisical consolidation of the lungs, “ the
“ infective particles are usually derived from
“ some pre-existing phthisical disease.” All
phthisis is inflammatory, but to apply the
term “ pneumonic,” tends, Dr. Greens adds,
to mislead.
The pneumonia preceding or accompanying
phthisis would therefore appear to have a
special feature, allied to tuberculosis. Is not
the differentiating element a micrococcus ?
or some form of fungaceous organism
endowed with special pathogenic property ?
And if tubercular virus, or phthisical material,
be thus transferable from one locality to


another within the same body, may it not
likewise be transferable from one body to
another through the atmosphere ?
This transference of infecting particles is
the mode of communicating phthisis most
obvious with present means of judging. Virus
conveyed from a diseased to a healthy lung
sets up therein the irritation and inflammation
peculiar to phthisis. Whether catarrh can
cause phthisis in absence of predisposition,
weakness of lung, or diathesis, is with many
a matter of doubt, as is also the question
whether physical states of respired air, arising
from mere cold and damp, can thus act on
respiratory organs irrespective of proclivity.
But connected with the inflammatory theory
one thing cannot be lost sight of in the
statistics of phthisis among young adults in
this colony. It has been shown that the
disease is most fatal about the twentieth year.
Now Niemeyer, reviver of the new favourite
doctrine, states that the pneumonia apt to run
into phthisis “ does not occur usually, even in
“ delicate and vulnerable persons, before the
“ age at which pulmonary diseases generally


“ become more frequent; and it then takes
“ the place of those inflammatory diseases of
“ other organs which have prevailed during
“ the preceding period of life.”
This peculiarity may give a clue to the
cause of the sudden increase of phthisis in
native Australians approaching maturity. The
tax on vital energy, when hope or fear at the
outset of life come in conflict, may be too
great for the inherent stamina. Or there
may be unusual exposure to inhalation of
specific virus. If phthisis were caused by cold
and damp in ill-drained towns, they might be
expected to affect all ages. But the disease
does not appear to be induced by mere cold
or damp in absence of that special irritant
already mentioned. The crowding or huddling
young folks together in sleeping-rooms and
work-rooms facilitates the process of trans-
ferring virus, very much as children catch
ringworm. Nobody would hesitate to separate
a ringwormy head from other heads ; but who
amongst us would dream of excluding a lung
loaded with infecting irritant particles—
micrococci—in the blighted epithelium of


diseased air vesicles ? Nobody would be so
infatuated, absurd, hard-hearted, and theo-
retically cruel. And yet an analogue of that
worm, infecting irritant particle, or organism,
at havoc on the mucous lining of the air
vesicle, filling and packing the alveoli with
dead epithelial scales that cannot escape
through the narrow necks of the infundibula
into the bronchi as readily as they melt
in benign inflammatory catarrh, having no
infecting particle, is now believed on good
pathological evidence to be as effectively
at work, and as communicable as is the
irritant that sets going the peculiar irritation
in the protoplasm of epithelium on the outer
skin. The latter can easily be seen under
very ordinary magnifying power, as a minute
creeping plant; but the devastating organism
in the air vesicle has not yet been as clearly
defined, if, indeed, the real mischief worker
be not here, as in some other infectious
diseases, beyond the visible limit. Yet it can
be detected through its effect. Its existence
may be matter of inference; but the result
produced cannot be equalled by any common


inflammatory action. That much is certain.
The means of preventing ordinary catarrh, or
inflammation, call it catarrhal, or lobular, or
broncho-pneumonia, or what you will, do not
suffice to check the action of special irritant
or infective particle inducing phthisis.
Hence, all general conclusions drawn from
the presence or absence of common inflamma-
tory lung affections from seasonal changes are
utterly fallacious when applied in a priori
reasoning about the astiology of phthisis.
The infective agent in phthisis and
tuberculosis has been oft referred to by Dr.
Green, and many other leading pathologists;
but none have till lately given it a name. In
conjecturing what it may be like, or belong to,
one may be over-bold ; but yet the blank in
pathological knowledge is at least open to a
venture. Should conjecture prove true, the
result will be of infinite practical value. It
will explain many points hitherto veiled in
doubt. Thus, no physiological reason has
yet been given, though many efforts have been
made to show why the upper lobe, or apex, of
the lung is most liable to attack. And yet,


if infection depend on inhaling an irritant
particle, it is clear that the air vesicles most
readily reached will be most exposed to
contagion. The air vesicles are carefully
protected by the columnar epithelium of the
minuter bronchioles hindering entrance of
the smallest body ; but yet, if under relaxed
state oh the general system, the respiratory
movement is carried on in an atmosphere
laden with exuviae from phthisical lungs,
inhalation of their infective material and
inoculation therewith, will readily take place ;
when the rest of the process may be left to
morbid nature.
These considerations lead to an idea of the
true basis for a pathological classification of
cases of phthisis into real and simulative, the
latter arising from inhalation of merely
. mechanically irritating particles of dust, as in
iron grinders, potters, colliers, cabinetmakers,
and the like, in whom the disease readily
subsides on removal of the mechanical cause \
while the former, or true phthisis, comes alone
from inhaled organisms that propagate them-
selves in the living tissues, and so cause the


caseating alveolar changes to become pro-
gressive. Their secondary effect include cell
infiltration within the alveolar walls, conden-
sation of connective tissue, vascular obliteration,
and other changes only made known within
the last few years by the morbid anatomist.
f ...
This may appear mere speculative writing ;
but it is all important for the question under
consideration. That conjecture is warranted
is admitted by the best example. In his
latest contribution, 1878, Dr. Green, alluding
to phthisis as par excellence an apex disease,
frankly admits, in reference to the reason why
it is so, that “ our knowledge on the subject
“is undoubtedly most incomplete ; ” while in
the work on morbid anatomy of the same
year, it is but conjectured that the infective
agent may be a “ minute organism.” Such a
body would necessarily exert a very different
influence from a merely mechanical irritant,
behaving rather in the manner of a contagium
vivum , or septic organism.
Hence it would follow that in explaining the
necessity for free ventilation wherever human
beings gather, it will not be enough to


expatiate upon the need of renewal of air to
replace that vitiated, or rather deprived of
its vital part by previous respiration; but
it must be still more important to point out
that in breathing pre-breathed air there is
always the probability of inhaling the specific
organisms of true pulmonary phthisis; and if
so, then all idea about climate conferring an
immunity would become the most pernicious
doctrine that could be inculcated.
That specious delusion would be all the
more dangerous, unless it could be shown
that any condition of ordinary air would be
capable of oxidising or destroying those
particles while they are active within the
pulmonary alveoli, or in the outer air, after
they have been exhaled, or otherwise extruded
from the lungs; but of the existence of
such a quality in common air there exists
no proof whatever. The vitality of these hypo-
thetical, because invisible, infective particles
in phthisis, external to their bodily nidus,
may be equal to that belonging to typhoid
contagium, whether the latter be in form of
a spherule of protoplasm, or in micrococci
G


therewith associated. Of this contagium,
recent experiments by Dr. Letzerich, showed
these organisms invariably multiplying in
protoplastic spherules ; but it remained
undecided whether the virulent power resided
in the protoplasm or in the associated
organisms. The difference is not immaterial,
but important, because if it be in the
former, then any chemical capable of altering
the constitution of hyaline would neutralize
the virus, while if it be in the latter, it
would, to do this, require an agent able to
kill micrococci, a point to be better decided
by actual clinical work than by laboratory
experiment. The researches of Letzerich
go far to confirm the view taken of typhoid
virus in a recent publication by the author
on that fever; and it in turn may probably
throw a glimmer of theoretical as well as
practical light on the specific contagium in
phthisis.
That against either contagium peroxide of
hydrogen, or gum tree aroma, are inert, we
have in this colony abundant proof, though
phthisis virus might perhaps be destructible


under some special atmosphere, such as that
of the Solfatara, which is largely charged
with sulphuric acid and arsenic, or that
near New Zealand geysers, said to contain
chemical compounds from volcanic vapour.
The air filled with sulpho-arsenical fumes
rising from the half-extinct crater of the
Solfatara at Pozzuoli, lately found effective in
treating phthisis, by Dr. Franza, and other
Neapolitan physicians, is supposed to exert a
special local as well as a • general tonic and
alterative action. But the nature of the local
effect is not explained. When more minutely
examined it may be ascertained to be destruc-
tive of organic particles, acting on air vesicle
epithelium in the manner already described;
the impaired nutrition leading to mineral
inanition, particularly in various phosphates
so characteristic of wasting, and to repair of
which principal schemes of treatment have
been hitherto directed, being, like loss of fat,
a secondary and dependent process, following
the primary infective local inoculation.
Nicotine fumes in tobacco factories have a
similar curative power over phthisis, and by
G 2


an action that must also be of a purely
local character. The vapour from the leaf
being uniformly diffused throughout the works,
when a phthisical person enters the medi-
cated air the nervous system usually soon be-
comes inured to the narcotic, but not so lung
and other parasitic organisms, which quickly
succumb and leave the body they infest to
regain normal life. Such appears to be the
rationale of cure. That recovery does occur
is beyond doubt. The fact is attested in
factories in this city, and has been observed
in other countries ; but the action has never
heretofore, as far as the writer is aware,
been ascribed to a germicidal property in the
drug. The nearest approach to the idea is
where contagium particles in other specific
fevers are described as either epithelium cells
or pus corpuscles adhering thereto; but even
that explanation has not been extended to
phthisis. That this malady may be propagated
by epithelium cells dried to dust and inhaled,
is no new doctrine ; the only novelty being
in the endeavour to follow the mode of action
of specific infective particles. Whether it may


prove true or not, it at all events points to
an elucidation of what otherwise remains in
absolute obscurity. That “ any pus or epi-
“ thelium cell, or even formless organic sub-
“ stance, floating in the air, may, if it find a
“ proper place or nidus in or on which it can
“be received, communicate its own action,
“ and thus act as a true contagium,” may be
eventually found true ; but the analogy from
smallpox virus, in the form of epithelium cells
and pus globules, vaccine, &c., do not at
present lend a tangible support to the con-
jecture. Neither do the facts observed here
regarding phthisis, which, equally with other
specific diseases, appears to require for its
inception the direct action of its own derived
specific contagium. To avoid any appearance
of didactic or dogmatic assertion, very full
particulars are here adduced from which is
deduced the opinion.
Any power exerted by such a special
atmosphere over pulmonary phthisis can be
best explained by inferring the action to be
germicidal over some animal or vegetable
organism, or alterative of protoplasm oper


ating in the affected tissues as a destructive
self-multiplying irritant. Whether such a
virulent condition of protoplasm can ever
result from common non-specific inflamma-
tory processes, or not, is a question not yet
determined by pathology; but clinical obser-
vers find it daily becoming more and more
evident that every instance of specific disease
had its prior infecting case, no one of them
ever “ being as a plant which comes from
“ the lust of the earth, without a formal seed,”
as Bacon once, and many theorists since,
argued. That every specific disease, like every
living thing, had at one time a beginning is
very true; but, when ? must remain in the
realm of transcendental etiology. In physic,
as in farming, men go by what they know,
that being of positive science the very
essence.
Speculating in this recondite region of
etiology, while practically teaching modes of
cure and laws of prevention, Professor Billroth
has again declared in the Pathology , 1879, a
belief that organic germs, in lifeless dust or
living molecule, of animal or vegetable nature,


are not always the same, and do not all alike
possess phlogogenous action, but only those
that are formed in certain products of in-
flammation ; that we know nothing of them
except through the inflammation they excite;
and although they cannot enter the system
except through a breach of surface, they yet
may fall as dust from the air of a sick
room or ward upon and irritate granulating
wounds, which, though not absorbing surfaces
to admit germs into the circulation, are
covered with young cells full of protoplasm.
The same germ dust may, it is added,
enter the lungs in breathing; but if so,
germs could not pass by absorption into the
circulation through the pulmonary membrane ;
nor reach beyond the air vesicles. There
being detained, if they had any special
irritant action at all, it would necessarily
be exerted on the raw protoplasm of the
nascent epithelial cell, in a manner similar
to the action on traumatic granulations ;
when the result would be the beginning of
phthisical irritation, precisely as the irritant
on a granulating wound would begin surgical


fever. The analogy is complete in all but
this, that from the surface wound the results
of irritation readily and freely flow away in
the form of purulent matter, whereas,
within the narrow air crypt, they collect in
compact masses, and there remain to undergo
necrobiotic decay, when micrococci breed
from their own germs in the animal matter
as maggots breed in putrid flesh, neither
maggot nor micrococcus being the real
irritant, but that alone which they consume,
and in consuming render inert—namely, the
new inflammatory product before “ decay’s
effacing finger” re-models it into a newer
form or phase of living matter. This is
the idea inculcated by the writer for many
years, long ere germ theories about “ death’s
household worms” became familiar in the
mouth as household words. But the “ wild
theorist ” of that olden time has become
the “ follower ” of his own disciple. Happy
he, who, in London or Vienna, can propound
a novel thought, which in Melbourne air
either will not kindly germinate, or, if it
should, is by broughamic critics crushed in


the braird. Thus were earlier “ wild
thoughts ” on phthisis and typhoid rudely
trodden; but in this more genial time the
beaten blades revive and grow stronger for
the trampling.
That the organisms, or infective particles,
act on epithelium within the air-chamber
rather than on that in the ultimate bronchiole,
is probably explicable by the anatomical
character of the alveolar epithelium being
nearer allied to endothelium of serous mem-
brane, than to the columnar form on a
mucous surface, while they will there,
moreover, meet with adenoid or lymphatic
glandular tissue peculiar to every other
pathological requirement. These distinctions
are clearly indicated in recent papers in
the Practitioner , on pulmonary pathology, by
Dr. Hamilton, whose views on the intra-
alveolar origin of tubercle, by accumulated
epithelial scales, were given some time ago in
the same journal, shortly after the author
offered similar views here. Dr. Hamilton
explained the accumulation by a proliferation,
rather than as a relic, as the author did, and


the point is still in doubt. But, in acute
bronchitis, after the older epithelium has
desquamated, basement scales in the finer
or ultimate branches of the bronchi do not
appear to proliferate; and, as these scales
are continuous with the layer of pavement
epithelium of the air vesicle, the same may
apply to it.
But, whether there be such proliferation
or not, from the nuclei of formed epithelium,
which seems to be probable, it is becoming
clear, that the giant cells are only ordinary
old worn out epithelial cells cemented
together, and not new growths.
This, at all events, is the view now taken
by Dr. Shepherd, who, in his Goulstonian
Lectures , 1877, says, “ interstitial, extra-
“ alveolar growth, is not the commencement
“of ordinary consumption ; that these growths
“ play but a slight, and that a secondary,
“ part in phthisis; and I shall hold, with
“ authorities equal at least in reputation, if
“ not in number, to those who support the
“ contrary, that the pulmonary consumption
“of this country consists primarily in intra-


“alveolar changes;” that is the precise
view put forward by the author in 1876.
And Dr. Shepherd concludes, as he concluded,
that giant cells were only ordinary epithelial
cells, in another form, and that there is
no such thing as a pathognomonic tubercle
corpuscle. How these epithelial waste mate-
rials accumulate to form infinitely innumerable
foreign bodies in the alveoli, irritating sur-
rounding tissue, the author has elsewhere
endeavoured to explain. Theory thus vindicates
itself as the very backbone of true practice.
These are admittedly abstruse and difficult
questions to decide, beyond the ken of.
laity; yet they are all essentially necessary
to be understood before a clear idea can be
formed upon the subject; while there cannot
be a doubt that their study would be infinitely
more profitable, and worthy of calm reflection
in scientific society, than perpetual wrangling
over the now more than ever undoubted
presence of the disease whose natural history
they would help to elucidate.
Let us now quite cursorily survey the future
prospects of this community in its relation to


phthisis, and estimate the economic value of
accurate, intimate, pathological knowledge of
the malady, without which, indeed, there can
be nothing beyond blind empirical tentative
effort, and loose talk about prevention. Such
a review is the more needful since phthisis,
unlike its congener typhenteric fever, never
occurs in such outbreaks as create panics
which quickly subside and are soon forgotten,
but works away quietly, stealthily, unobtru-
sively, exciting no deeper emotion than pity
for individual suffering, or aversion for objects
of trouble and no little inconvenience.
Economists have not determined the money
value to the State of every unit in a popula-
tion. That diseases mainly incident to young
people trained in skilled handicrafts interrupt
the material well-being of a young colony,
daily becomes more evident; and a single
instance of the kind may do more to impress
upon the commercial mind the industrial
bearing of a medical question, than theoretic
expositions of the mode in which pathology
steps in to explain some relations between
capital and labour. Morbid humanity is not


always a mere question of sympathy, to be
relegated to doctofs, or the back-ground of
hospital charity &nd bad beneficence, with
their mock professional dignity and pride of
patronage to medical preferment.
At a recent meeting of the Statistical
Society of London, in a debate on a paper
read by Mr. H. H. Hayter, Government
Statist for Victoria, on the general growth
of the colony, Mr. William Westgarth spoke
to the effect that, “as regarded the extension
“ of manufactures, he had some doubts whether,
“in a semi-tropical climate, it was well to
“ shut up any large portion of the population
“in such close work as most manufactures
“ involved.”
It might in reply be asked, Does indoor
labour necessarily involve any morbid condi-
tion peculiar to a handicraft ? No doubt Mr.
Westgarth had in mind phthisis when he
made the remark, because it is notoriously
the disease par excellence of indoor life.
But pathology having no polity, the whole
tenor of the argument maintained throughout
these pages is to demonstrate that not the


trade or occupation, but the faulty way in
which they are too frequently carried on, does
harm, in this climate, exhctly as in every
climate under the sun. Hence, the natural
accident of the climate, being semi-tropical,
cannot make the colony unsuitable for indoor
trades. As well might we contend that,
because domestic service, as proved by the
records of the Melbourne Hospital, yields as
large a proportion to the aggregate phthisical
death-rate here as in England, therefore is
this climate unfit for that calling.
A like common fallacy about avocation and
insanity Dr. Maudsley justly alludes to in the
Pathology of Mind, 1879, observing : “ Whether
“ one profession, trade, or pursuit more than
“ another favours the occurrence of insanity
“ is not really so much a question of the
“ effect of the particular pursuit as of the
“ habits of those who follow it, and of the
“ spirit in which they follow it.” But when
it is added that the cause of brain and mind
degeneration and disease is not, “as it was
“ long thought to be, a specific morbid entity
“ which, like some evil spirit, takes hostile


“ possession of the body, or of a particular
“ part of it, and must be expelled by some
“ specific drug,” a very notable error creeps
into the reasoning. For if the argument
here maintained hold good, as so many facts
go to show, the cause of phthisis is just
such a parasitic invader; and it would be
as absurd to call its effect a result of a
11 greater or less degeneration from healthy
“ life,” as to so describe the irritation of an
acarus or a tricophyton. What may be true
enough of sonic brain or mind defect is by
too wide a generalisation wrongly applied to
every other bodily disease. Phthisical and
syphilitic insanity are alike due, each to the
pathogenic action of a specific morbid entity,
often entering the body when it is in prime
health, and setting up through tubercle or
gumma brain-tissue irritation, of which mind
alienation is only one symptom an irritation
that can only be cured by removing the
cause by “ specific ” drugs; and in this
view the proximate cause of insanity is
more directly material than even the struc-
tural decay referred to in the latest and


most philosophical exposition of modern, or
more properly, of positive psychology.
The following comparison shows the extent
of the increase in 1878 over 1877 in the
number of deaths from phthisis in Victoria,
with the very greatly increased percentage of
native born Australians. Whether the increase
be going on merely pari passu with normal
growth of population, or whether it be in
excess, remains to be discovered ; but it also
unquestionably proves that the young people
enjoy no immunity. A very large item of
increase is in females between 15 and 25
years of age, which may indicate a work-
room significance.
The total increase in the whole colony for
the year, over last year, is from 1088 to
1124; and of that number the proportion of
native born rose, as will be seen on referring
to the table at page 14, from 254 in 1877
to 317 in 1878, that is, from 23 to 28 per
cent.
About 79 per cent, of the deaths from
phthisis of males and 86 of females occurred
between the ages of 15 and 55 ; 5 per cent.


of the males and 8 per cent, of the females
died at under 15 years of age, and 16 per
cent, of the males and 6 per cent, of the
females died at over 55 years of age. These
and other particulars may be gleaned from
the following table :

But a large increase of deaths from phthisis
occurred in children under 5 years of age ;
and it may be made a question whether
these were cases of genuine disease, and
H


not registration errors. Probably, it will be
denied that childhood is prone to phthisis,
just as it was the other day, in dialectic
strategy, denied that infancy was prone to
typhoid fever, the doubter forgetting that in
Dr. Murchison’s nursery occurred the initial
cases that unravelled the etiology of the
memorable Marylebone typical milk epidemic
of 1873. But, to deny to early life phthisis,
merely because the anatomical seat of deposit
varies from its locality in adult life, is quite
untenable. Nay, it may be very confidently
asserted that a large proportion of that
enormous list of infantile deaths attributed
to the ill-defined diseases “ atrophy ” and
“ debility,” are neither more nor less than
deaths due to infantile phthisis. If this be
so, the fact would vitiate every conclusion
usually drawn from an infantile phthisical
death-rate; for, if the disease be differently
determined in England and Victoria, the two
death-rates cannot be comparable. In the
letter of the Government Statist, inserted at
page 10, it is doubted if these cases be
real; but that is the opinion of a layman


and may or may not agree with general
medical experience.
In order to learn more exact particulars
about the infantile phthisical death-rate,
reference was made to last annual report
of the Children’s Hospital; but it is only men-
tioned that 18 deaths occurred from “ lung
“ disease,” and 6 from “ debility ,” without more
precise definition —a record that may suffice
for lay business at a charity, but is entirely
useless as an aid to scientific inquiry. This
remark is the more pertinent since in last
number, May 1879, of the Australian Medical
Journal, an editorial note intimates that/ ‘ it is
“ the conviction of those who know most of the
“ records of this”—the Registrar-General’s—
“ office, that the certificates of death sent in
“ by medical men are, to a large extent, un-
“ reliable, from the obviously unscientific man-
“ ner in which they are furnished; ” and
to ensure accuracy, proposes a thorough
reform, that would have to begin with our
metropolitan hospitals. At the same time,
as the Report upon phthisis was adopted by
the Medical Society, because —“ Based as it is
h 2


upon carefully prepared statistics,” 1 obtained
direct from the Registrar-General, if it really
can “ enable the profession to form tolerably
correct opinions upon this important question ”
of the prevalence of phthisis, and was indeed
“ complete and comprehensive,” 2 its utility
entirely depended on the fidelity and accuracy
with which legally qualified medical men,
who alone give death certificates, fulfil their
onerous public obligation. If their certificates
were accepted as authentic then, they cannot
consistently be rejected as unauthentic now,
merely because argument based upon them
goes against a particular theory. Besides, it
is well known that for some time great care
has been taken at the Registrar-General’s
office, in referring back all certificates of death
that were dubiously worded, so as to have
them made more exact.
The slur thus vaguely thrown on a whole
body of medical men is not sustained by
a single instance of misfeasance, and is
probably of no logical value.

Therefore, without pledging the complete
accuracy of every item, the average is
accepted as trustworthy. And in order to
show the prominent player is a death-rate
by phthisis and atrophy, the following table
is appended :
List of the most prevalent diseases in Victoria, arranged
in order of fatality, according to the total number
of deaths occurring from each during the 25 years,
ending in 1878.

To the above table it is unnecessary to add
a word more than that the rate for atrophy
in proportion to the general death-rate,
equals, if it does not exceed, the rate in
England from the same disease of nutrition,


a fact that either says little for our boasted
improved circumstances of life and method
of feeding infants and young children, by a
people who are in the daily habit of going
to the grocers for their physic, and to the
druggists for their infant’s food, or speaks a
great deal for a class of diseases of which
the Government Statist remarks: —
“ Large numbers of deaths of young
“ children are each year set down under
“ this head, frequently no doubt from want
“ of better information respecting the primary
“ diseases. It is much to be desired that,
“ where possible, medical men would define
“ these deaths more accurately.”
The infantile phthisis increase in 1878 could
hardly be alone due to atrophy misnamed,
because in 1877 and 1878 the number of
deaths therefrom was nearly the same, though
more might have been looked for with growing
population. That it was indeed phthisis is
probable, since the total number of deaths
from atrophy, tabes mesenterica, and infantile
phthisis simultaneously increased in greater or
less degree, thus:

However, to restrict discussion to young
adults just entering upon the bread earning
period of life, is the point to which the reader s
attention is now more particularly directed.
The point merits careful inquiry, because it
formed the critical difficulty which many
people could not get over without assuming
what a glance at exact figures shows did
not exist; and also because it may now
form the basis for legislative interference
with factory life and the working time of
young female adults. In the following table
will be seen how the rates have risen in the
age-periods 15 to 25? an d 25 to 35? an d
declined from 35 to 45> an d 45 55 >
clearly enough proving the vulnerability of the
young people of the colony.

Here, then, with marked falling off in
deaths from phthisis at the older ages,
there were between the active ages of 15
an d 35) 1877, 44 1 deaths from phthisis,
and in 1878, 482, being 41 in the latter
more than in the former year. In the two
years, the total deaths from phthisis at these
work-room ages were 923.
They cannot have been all of invalids from
other countries swelling the list; but were
mostly of residents, however their complaint
was got. This becomes quite evident by the
numbers in the following table, showing how
comparatively few of the deaths occurred in


persons who had been less than 5 years in
the colony.

It will be seen that out of the 3003 of
whom particulars could be obtained, who died
of phthisis in Victoria during 1876, 1877,
and 1878, 762, or 25*37 P er cent., were born
in Australasia; that 2003, or 66*70 per cent.,
more had resided there for upwards of five
years; that 112, or a further 3*73 per cent.,
had lived there for upwards of two years;


and that only 126, or about 4 per cent., had
lived there for less than two years.
The census of 1871 disclosed a marked
increase in deaths from phthisis at ages from
15 to 35. This unlooked for excess of the
malady in the latest fashionable health resort,
after two decades of ripe experience, rather
staggered certain theorists, whose gain was
endangered unless they succeeded in con-
necting so unpropitious a result with the
operation of some peculiar influence not
climatic. Therefore, the so-called “ apparent ”
but very real increase was apologetically
ascribed to an undue influx of too hopeful
incurables who had been attracted hither by
glowing tales about a health paradise, with
a capital, which if not exactly the much
desiderated City of Hygieia, was at least by
report of those who claimed to be experts
pronounced “the best place in the world,
“at all seasons, for consumptives, in every
“stage of the disease.” The influx of
pilgrims, whose faith was disenchanted by
reality, only served to offer “ a possible
“ explanation of what would otherwise be an


“ inexplicable anomaly,” to minds imbued
with a belief that phthisis could not pro-
pagate itself in warm, dry, balmy, ozony
air ; but if ever there met with, would only
be found among tubercular lungs diseased
before arrival. The proof of this was indeed
said to have been “ brought out in a table
“ in the Victorian Year Book for 1876
“ (page 75), where it is shown that of 49
“ persons (40 males and 9 females) dying
“ of phthisis in Victoria within two years
“ (31 of them within one year), after their
“ arrival in the Australian colonies, 42 were
“ between 15 and 35 years of age, with the
“ probability that they were almost all
“ above 20.”
But while 49 phthisical immigrants died
within two years after coming to the colony
to live, igß (96 males and 102 females) at
the same ages died after living' there over
two years—indeed, many over five, most
even over ten years—that is, longer than
the ascertained duration of their illness,
which must consequently have begun in the
colony. In addition to these, 15 1 (70 males


and 81 females) dying of phthisis at those
ages had actually been born in the country.
To set against 4Q new comers whose un-
timely deaths were held to argue injustice
done to an injured climate, were 349 (igß
old residents and 15 1 natives) of whom
nothing was said. Sophistry can “ prove
anything by figures ” if you allow it to
square stubborn facts in this way. But the
thing so “ proved ” cannot be approved as
in harmony with scientific or any other sort
of truth—the “fair round dealing which is
the honour of human nature,” as well as
the only promoter of medical science. The
semblance of proof affords a short-lived
triumph, which is after all a sorry sort of
utility. A mere fractional part of the cited
table at page 75 in the Victorian Year Book
1876-7 was reproduced, the remainder of
the formula being overlaid by a gloss on
the text criticised.
To restore the table the following figures
are now collated ; and beside them are placed
corresponding figures for 1878, for com-
parison.

From these figures it will be seen that
more phthisical males than females appear
to have sought a sanatorium in Victoria ;
for in two years 44 males died after less
than a year’s residence, and only 5 females.
This agrees with experience in private
practice, the only opportunity of knowing
the numbers coming over and above the
recorded number of fatal cases.
But amongst other residents and native
born, deaths from phthisis of females pre-
ponderate. The difference may be partly
due to the proclivity to phthisis of domestic
servants, a liability doubtless owing to the
frequency with which young girls fresh from
open air country life are in their daily
household work brought into contact with
infective particles thrown off from ulcerating
lungs affected with the specific malady—
particles all the more deadly because unheeded,
or deemed innocuous and therefore never
dreaded. Not that ordinary domestics are
occupied nursing or tending invalids; but
cleaning bedrooms and consequent inhaling
dust of dried sputa must obviously be a


daily occurrence. In such young women
phthisis is commonly attributed to cold, or
badly ventilated dank sleeping rooms, but
seldom or never to the really potent agent,
direct contagion. No effort is ever made to
intercept infective particles from phthisical
sputa floating in the air along with ordinary
dust, or to ensure their chemical destruction.
Indeed, he would be talked about as a
fussy enthusiast who would propose to do
anything so pragmatically absurd, and might
even be shunned in practice for his prodigious
nonsense.
And yet, if any sceptical reader doubt
the excessive fatality from phthisis among
the class referred to, hospital records will
amply satisfy curiosity.
It will not often greatly avail to interrogate
sufferers themselves, for they indeed, can
rarely tell, and seldom do they even guess,
where they caught contagion ; many, indeed,
hardly entertain a lurking suspicion, so
insidious is the virus, and long latent ere
it excite attention in the earlier phases of
the affection.


The following figures afford adequate proof
of the accuracy of these statements regarding
the numbers in hospital:—

Memorandum of Women treated for Phthisis during
the years 1877-1878.

„ single 78
Machinists ~ ... ... ... 2
Tailoresses ~ ... 2
Laundresses ~ ... 6
Seamstresses „ 7
Barmaids ~ 2
192
Of 248 phthisical females admitted in two
years into the Melbourne Hospital, the
occupations of 192 are known, leaving 56
undetermined. Of the 192, only 19 worked
at handicrafts deemed active in causing lung
disease, and 173 domestics. Even if the 78
single women were alone admitted as domestic
servants proper, and the 95 married women
excluded —though they likewise often clean
up after invalid lodgers—-the number would
be enough to settle the question. For, if


the thousands of female machinists, girls
working in factories under careful hygienic
supervision, only gave 2 cases of phthisis
to the metropolitan hospital, why should the
infinitely smaller number of seamstresses,
not under any regulating control, send 7
cases ? or single domestic servants 78 ? or
single and married together 192 ?
It may perhaps be replied that domestic
servants are generally friendless, or without
relatives in town to whom to go for aid in
sickness, while machinists and factory hands
are nearer home; and though there may be
truth in the remark, still, the difference of
social circumstance can hardly, one would
think, be great enough to fully account for
the immense disparity. The point could only
be determined by finding the occupation of
the deceased in every death from phthisis,
in some way similar to that begun in the
Digest , &c., 1871.
But it seems undeniable that, as far as
they at present go, the facts adduced make
the argument formerly advanced in the essay
On Phthisis , 1870, assume the form of
1


verified inference; and show how “ things
“ will never be done in act except they be
“ first done in conceit.” These facts are
theory reduced to practice. At all events,
they altogether negative the foregone idea
that factory life cannot be regulated so as
to enable artisans to work in-door in this
or in any climate, without of necessity
incurring danger of inducing phthisis.
The difference between an ordinary factory,
or work-room, with an atmosphere of common
air, and such a place as a tobacco factory,
with its air highly medicated, either by
nicotine in fume or impalpable dust, alone
or in conjunction with other derivatives from
the narcotic weed—parvoline, pyridine, and
ammonium compounds, that are, however,
rather present in burnt tobacco smoke, and
results of combustion, appears to be simply
this, that if workers in the former be exposed
to the specific contagion of parasites they
may be infected ; whereas in the peculiarly
medicated air of the latter, contagion from no
sort of animal or vegetable parasitic organism,
external or internal, will ever take effect.


This may perhaps be further illustrated by
the action of sea air on phthisical lungs in
sea voyaging. That this air checks early
phthisis is very generally allowed ; but whether
it act through abundant free oxygen, or by
particular medicinal ingredients contained in
that air, is not clearly known. To bromine and
iodine continuously inhaled in natural combi-
nation along with saline particles, in however
minute quantity, the effect may be partly
due, since these elements are peculiarly
inimical to land animal parasitic life in every
variety and form. Sea air would thus rank, re
phthisis, as a specially medicated atmosphere,
call it climatic, or what you will.
It cannot be said air on the open ocean is
not known to contain bromine and iodine,
or that air near the sea shore may not derive
both from decayed sea weed; but only, that
these elements do not appear to destroy
parasites on marine animals. The subject
has as yet received but little attention. The
former is not a difficulty, neither the latter; for
it does not follow that what kills one species
must be equally fatal to every other living in
i 2


the same medium. Thus, for example, while
soda salt is obnoxious to liver fluke, it is
quite an essential for the life of the hydatid,
which, by the way, bromine and iodine
readily kill, as they kill struma and syphilide
organisms. Fluke cannot exist in an animal
full fed on common salt; while hydatids can
no more subsist without it, the fluid contents
of the cyst in which the parasites thrive and
multiply being a strong saline solution.
Both are often erroneously held to be allied
species in nature and origin; while the
natural history of all these parasites supplies
an admirable analogy for deduction in the
etiology of phthisis.
Moreover, the keener effect of bromine and
iodine in natural over artificial combination is
of great significance in relation to the curative
action of sea air in phthisis. The greater
efficacy of nature’s combinations was long
ago pointed out in Bacon’s earlier writings;
and the same principle has lately been
revived as a novelty in connection with the
superiority of native over artificial mineral
water.


Whether factory life be otherwise antago-
nistic to inherent vigour; or rather tend to
leave the physical frame undeveloped, little
robust, or even diminutive, with “ subtle
“ brains and lissom fingers,” are entirely
different questions, in viewing which it may
be well to wariljT refrain from offering direct
advice that the ardent amour propre of a
proud young colony might deem invidious,
or which might, forsooth, be indignantly
denounced as “ disparaging slanders ” by
medical mentors, flattering or heroic, who
cling to belief in the tory maxim “ the
“ greater the truth the greater the libel.”
One ancient sage cautioned well-meaning
would-be social reformers that “In all human
“ governments, those who are at the helm
“ can introduce what they desire for the
“ good of the people more successfully by
“ pretext and indirect ways than directly; ”
or, as a contemporary poet said :
“ And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
“ By indirections find directions out,”
adding,
“ And that’s not suddenly to be perform’d,
“ But with advice and silent secrecy.”


Whichever mode, direct or suggestive, be
adopted, some action is urgently required for
regulating crowded work rooms too often
in unfit places; an affair, however, to which
we here can do no more than allude. But
in immediate relation to the argument on
the non-modifying power of climate, one
plea deserves passing remark, to show how
trade would utilise physiology.
It has been urged that early development
of the female system is peculiar to this
climate, fitting young girls for all the
functions of grown matrons. This is probably
another outcome of inveterately ingrained
medico-popular error. Such monstrosities of
prematurity are occasionally met with in all
climates; but the statement that it is
common in this colony is unsupported by
experience. Anyone acting on such a belief
in a precocious maturity will be entirely
mistaken, and may do great harm, particularly
if, as is threatened, the erroneous belief be
made a basis for legislation on privileged or
enforced toil. The tissues of youth have
here as everywhere the same plastic nature,


4
and, if too heavily taxed suffer injury •
for when any imaginary prematurity is taken
advantage of, the invariable result is broken
health. If the plea be urged unwittingly,
it is well corrected; if knowingly, it shows
how cupidity dulls the moral sense.
Reverting for a moment to the argument
derived from the number of phthisical cases
among natives admitted to hospital, it may be
here mentioned that while formerly data later
than 1874 could not be had, they now are
obtained down to 1878, and show that the
proportion has only increased in the last four
years to 15 per cent, in hospital cases, whereas
the general phthisis death rate among natives
in Melbourne and suburbs has risen to 33
per cent, in 1878 ; clearly proving that the
majority of fatal cases of phthisis were not
drawn from the country to be treated in
hospitals, but were treated at the patients’
own homes.
Again, to show this hospital ratio, the
following extension of the original table
is now given in continuation of that at
page 22: —

The total number of deaths from phthisis
during the four years being 470, the 71 deaths
among the Australian born is about 15

There is already given at page 97 in
tabular form the number who died of phthisis
in Victoria, at different ages, in 1878. The
following addition to that list, showing the
relative numbers of deaths in Melbourne and
suburbs, deducted from the total number in
Victoria, will be found suggestive:

Of the small number of deaths from
phthisis between 5 and 15 years of age,
an explanation is given at page 76, where
the circumstance is also shown to be no
way peculiar to this colony.
By comparing these numbers with figures
on page 97, it will be seen that in 1878,
of all deaths from phthisis in Victoria, 36
more occurred in town than in the rest of
the colony; that 35 more males died in
k


the country than in town; but that 71
more females died in town than in the
country. How far these fatal cases relate
to the distribution of the sexes in urban
and rural populations, or what they imply
as to effect of occupation, is hard to say.
As remarkable are the many dead domestics,
among whom, by the way, will rarely be
found any Jewish people, who never enter
Christian tents, and seldom die from phthisis.
Their exemption may be racial or hereditary,
due to habits of life, or non-exposure to
direct contagion, every doubt involving a
new etiological problem, and greater need for
microscopic scrutiny of the causes of disease.
In a very recent Government Gazette appear
these censuring words : —“ It seems dis-
“ creditable that, in the absence of any
“ particular epidemic, so fine a city as
“ Melbourne should have so high a propor-
“ tion from zymotic diseases ” —in 1878
nearly 27 per cent., against less than 21
per cent., in London, in While
bewailing this fatality, so “ discreditable,”
from acute specific contagious fevers, chief


among them being perennial typhoid, the
60 deaths from phthisis in a total of 483
deaths from all causes occurring in that
same month, evoked no official commentary.
Phthisis fatality has evidently grown too
familiar to call forth particular remark,
or even arrest momentary attention.
Amid dire indifference to the steady progress
of the most fell disease in Victoria, it may
be vain to try to determine a pathological
problem, which, if medically settled, would
be an honor to “ the higher physicians,” and
an incalculable benefit for the community.
