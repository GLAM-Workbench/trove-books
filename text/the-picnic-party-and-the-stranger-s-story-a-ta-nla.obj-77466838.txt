Stranger.
On Yarra?s banks, near where the willows bend
To kiss the stream upon its downward way,
A party met, a happy time to spend
In mirth and sport, one Austral Christmas day.
The place selected was a quiet dell
Between two ridges, whereon wattle trees,
Thick clust?ring, caught the Sun?s rays as they fell,
And yielded perfume to the western breeze.
And here were gathered quite a goodly thrPng
Of youth and beauty, friends both young and old;
These whiled the hours with festive dance and song,
And many a tale, by each in turn, was told.
One spoke of some adventure in that isle ?
The home of Freedom ?far beyond the.sea;
Another would an interim beguile
With pleasing song, or tale of chivalry.


Some danced, while strains of cheerful music fell
To guide their motions in the waltz or reel;
While youthful pairs would merry jokes repel
On passions few confess, howe?er they feel.
So passed the happy time; all joined the fun,
While none denied response to friendly call
For tale or song, until was left but one
On whom the lot to speak perforce must fall.
Their guest was he?for, walking out that day,
He this charmed haunt by accident drew near;
When they, with kindly welcome, stopped his way,
And begged his presence at their Christmas cheer.
Their sports he joined with hearty unfeigned zeal,
And with them now had sat him down to rest;
Yet, though a stranger, they no strangeness feel
With one who shared their mirth with so much zest,
A man he was on whom the hand of time
Its mark had set, though he was young, in truth;
A wand?rer, too; and in far distant clime
Had passed from childhood up to sturdy youth.
He looked like one upon whose life?s brief page
Was writ some heavy grief?misfortune dire;
His hair was whitened, like to that of age,
Yet sparkled in his eye youth?s ardent fire.


? The story I shall tell,? he said, ?to you
Is not of mirthful kind, as yours have been;
My ?Story of a Life? so sad, so true?
Australian is, in incident and scene,
And ne'er before was told, for only one
Of those who knew its origin survives;
The rest, alas! their earthly race have run,
And left but little to record their lives.
?So gather round; and, should it make you sad,
Or interrupt the current of your mirth,
It may remind you, in your moments glad,
That suffering and sorrow dwell on earth:
But He, whose pilgrimage with us began
(Long centuries past) on happy Christmas morn-
When those wise shepherds heralded to man
The glad intelligence, A Saviour?s bom?
? His promise gave that we, in deepest grief,
On Him could rest, and on His hid rely;
And, trusting to His word, in firm belief,
We may life?s cares and troubles all defy.
And this, my story, which I shall relate,
May season wholesomely your glad repast;
For, should misfortune mark your earthly state,
You may secure true happiness at last.


?The hour requires that I should hasten on.
And briefly, now, this hapless story tell.?
Then, in its golden wane, the Sun?s rays shone
Obliquely through the foliage of the dell.
?Twas that part of our Southern summer?s day
When afternoon and evening strive for power,
Until the first reluctantly gives way,
And evening reigns the mistress of the hour.
A purely Austral one, when streaks of gold
Through clouds of silver marked the western sky,
As ?twere a heavenly mantle, to enfold
That happy day when it should close and die.
The guest resumed: his deep voice, rich and clear,
Like music, suiting well the time and tale;
The joyous party all assembled near;
No voice but his then sounded in the vale:?


THE STRANGER?S STORY.
?Neath an old tree (its branches spreading wide,
And round its trunk a raised and arched mound,)
A maid and youth were seated, side by side,
Upon the grass that thickly clothed the ground.
The time was evening, Nature seemed at rest,
For then was hushed the busy hum of day;
The little birds, on light wings, sought their nest,
Or perched, in quiet, on a topmost spray.
The hour was one of sorrow: they must part,
And now had met to take a last adieu;
They loved with purest interchange of heart,
And theirs the fate of all who love as true.
With falthing voice, and tear-suffuse'd eyes,
And truthful eloquence, the youth began;
To check the rising tear in vain he tries;
His pleading thus, in mournful accents, ran: ?


? And this is, then, to be the end of all I
Quite useless now, again to make appeal
To those on whom, whate?er results, must fall.
The blame of what we both so soon must feel;
Yet, ere we part, for all our years of love,
And what thou hast endured for my sake : ?
Though poor, indeed, thy recompense will prove?
One last request of thee I now would make.
?It is that thou, in thy fond memory, still
A thought of one who loves thee wilt retain,
One who would yield his life to save thee ill?
Make any sacrifice to spare thee pain;
Upon whose path thy love?s sweet light hath shed
A brighter ray than e'er before it knew.
When from me all, aye, even hope, had lied,
?Twas thy pure love did life and hope renew.
? Oh, dear to me is this sequestered spot,
Where you and I so oft have vows exchanged,
Nor will the place, or vows be e?er forgot,
Though in the future we shall live estranged;
For thou, perchance, wilt meet with some new friend,
And thy rememb?ranee of the past may sleep;
But, if our thoughts e?er to the absent tend,
Then thine, with mine, may sometimes vigils keep.


? But why should I indulge in useless fears?
If mine the error, then be mine the pain;
Or \vl\y to that thought cling which still endears,
When those glad hours can ne?er return again?
My cup I now must drain in bitterness,
In solitude reviewing all the past;
O, could remembrance give but one pang less,
Or from my heart its heavy sorrow cast.'
?But time, if it should soften my deep grief,
Will not the mem?ry of thy worth erase;
The present gives no prospect of relief:
In death, mine eyes would still thy fair form trace.
Which, ere we met, was graven on .my soul;
For thou resemblance to one loved didst bear,
Ere Death (or friend or foe) usurped control,
And one to rest consigned, and one despair.
? She was the first my childish fancy knew,
When love was young and judgment immatured;
Her image on my mental mirror grew,
And there remained, with all beside obscured.
I found thee, living likeness of the past,
As one whose mission ?twas to guide and save;
While ev?ry grief which had my mind o?ercast
Lay buried, then, in love's too early grave.


? Why stepped I then from out my path to win
A heart no falsehood knew, nor any guile ?
Why, to the rest, did I another sin
Place on the record, to obtain thy smile ?
Not we the arbiters of our own fate,
To guide each action to whate?er it tends;
Nor have we sole control of love or hate,
Nor doth caprice direct our choice of friends?
?For, Phoenix-like, love once again returned
To life and joy, and bade me joy and live;
And, what so late my poignant grief had spurned,
A grateful, cheering influence did give.
My heart, much softened by its first distress,
Of its new love received the impress free;
Yet failed my tongue to thee that truth confess
Which might have drawn thy love and smiles from me.
? For oft, while gazing in thy beaming eyes?
Twin orbs of light, reflecting Heaven?s bright blue,
Directing thoughts to realms beyond the skies,
Where moves, in might and majesty, the True
(Like seeming depth of placid surfaced lake,
Which shows to view the azure and the gold;
Of all the changes, freely doth partake:
The varied beauties doth alike unfold.) ??


?< In loving admiration, noting them?
My heart upbraided, silent though my tongue:
Then came reflection, and I did contemn
Myself for silence, doing thee a wrong.
How much I longed to tell thee what I thought 1
Ah, could I now but tell thee all I feel.
With what deep anguish was my bosom fraught,
While still I strove that anguish to conceal.
? Then farewell sadly lingered on my lips,
Though love and honour urged it to be said;
Yet, when ?tis uttered, like a ?huge eclipse?
This life will seem to me-its brightness fled;
My soul will all exclude, save thee alone
And thy dear image; ev?rything but God:
Next but to Him, my heart shall be thy throne,
A smile thy sceptre, and a frown thy rod.
? For thou hast ever been to me the guide
Who taught me still in Virtue's path to steer;
And never yet didst frame thy lips to chide,
Though oft my follies cost thine eyes a tear.
How can I calmly part from one so good,
So gentle, loving, and withal so meek.
And how resign that love, which still withstood
What slander-poisoned tongues essayed to speak?


?Nor should I, were it thine own act, repine
But mutely bow unto the stern edict;
Nor ever, by an act or word of mine,
Upbraid thee for the pain thou didst inflict.
But let it pass, since Fate decrees it so,
And all resistance would be now in vain;
Yet ev?ry joy, but one, I could forego,
If naught had chanced to give this mutual pain
? For we, together, ne?er again shall stray
In sweetest converse, whiling many an hour;
For thee no more I?ll string the tuneful lay,
No more for thee may gather fragrant flower;
For thou wilt pass into another?s arms;
Another?s lips will now be pressed to thine;
Another's eye admire thy matchless charms;
Another?s ear to thy sweet voice incline.
?A merchant stands upon the sea-washed shore,
And views the ship, at once his boast and pride
But his, alas! the boast and pride no more?
In sight of home now sinking ?neath the tide,
Whose faithless bosom yields no sign or speck
To meet his anxious and distracted sight;
His ev?ry hope hath perished in that wreck:
No storm can rouse him more, nor peril fright.


So stand I now, upon the shore of life,
And see my treasure lost ?a gulf between ?
While all around is calm and bright, no strife;
The tumult is within ?without, unseen.
The wreck of fortune I could bear- ?have borne;
In life?s great struggle ?tis not new to cope;
But now, the loss of all I love I mourn,
And what is life when we lose love and hope?
?As when a trav'ller, ?mid the gloom of night?
No hand to guide him, and no voice to cheer
Sees what he thinks a hamlet?s cheerful light,
And yet no haven finds, no light draws.near:
So this strange passion doth with hope beguile,
Then leaves its votaries to pine and grieve.
The sparkling eye, the bright and joyous smile,
Are sometimes ignes fatal which deceive.
To think ?twere sin to love, were scarce unjust.
For, where ?tis true, it seldom doth succeed;
Th? ethereal flame illumes our frames of'dust
'To make the hearts within them ache and bleed,
Doth Fate to us alone this curse decree,
Or is it shared by all of human kind?
Twere better, sure, in solitude to be,
Than live with love when torture racks the mind


? For, heart and soul thou, dearest, doth divide?
O?er each thy influence keeps its potent sway;
While ev?ry thought, however turned aside,
To thee returns throughout the livelong day.
Oft, when in sleep my weary eyelids closed,
Thou present wert, in visions of the night;
And, when awake, the fear hath interposed
That Fate would rob me of my heart?s delight.
?Yet would I not believe, but hoped on still
'That circumstance would turn the adverse tide;
And sweet desire my anxious breast did fill
That thou, my joy, would?st be my own loved bride.
The last support to which my heart did cling
Has from me parted with this dire decree;
One solace yet: my hope belief doth bring
That thou wilt sometimes waste a thought on me;
? If but in mem?ry of those happy hours ?
The gleams of sunshine on life?s stormy day,
Which, alternating with the needful showers,
A lustre gives of bright and silv?ry ray?
The hours of freshness in the dawn of youth,
From those when Love his presence did conceal:
The after years of confidence and truth,
Until this hour of sadness which we feel.


? ! Tis sweet to be remembered ?mid all change,
When minds and mem?ries are no longer young,
And sweet to think that Time will ne?er estrange
The object from whose love all good thoughts sprung;
And this I ask of thee,? ?he paused, then drew
The maiden closely, in a warm embrace,
Near to his heart?than which none beat more true ?
While tears coursed swiftly down her lovely face.
Entranced they sat, while the slow-stealing night,
With misty herald, empire did assume;
The moon in splendour clomb the heaven-crowned height,
Her lucent beams all Nature did illume-
And silence reigne'd there; no sound was heard
But their deep sighs. That silence Zephyr breaks;
He, soaring high, the pendant leaves soon stirred,
Then spread his cool breath o?er their burning cheeks.
Yet slept they not: their sad thoughts far away
Into the future, dim and distant, strayed;
They saw the gulf which in their passage lay?
Its depth and darkness made their hearts afraid.
Who can conceive, in that dread interim spent
Between these two, what sad surmises ran
Through their distressed minds, with grief so rent,
While each that mystic future tried to scan?


But this must cease; for swift the moments flew,
Swift as doth meditation on the past,
When each day brought new hopes with life anew,
And youth?s bright sky no shadows overcast.
Then spake the youth:??Ahl why prolong this pain?
The past remember, and my fault forgive;
Let me no longer in suspense remain,
Pronounce my sentence; let me die or live!?
Then, in a voice low, musical, and soft?
As when the wind, o?er silver-crested sea,
The tall ship strikes, and, soaring up aloft,
Sings ?mid the cordage, making melody;
Or, when the /Kolian harp?whose straitened strings
Embrace the merest waft of evening?s breath ?
In sweetest tones its plaintive burden sings,
As ?twere from those beyond the power of death.
O, ?twas a heavenly voice; which once to hear,
The hearer stood enchanted in its spell,
So soft its music; yet ?twas one so clear,
The raptured sense could never quite dispel?
With sorrow overcharged, the maiden spake: ?
? The story of thy woe hath touched the chords
Of this sad heart of mine, which soon must break,
So deep is my distress. I have no, words


?In which to speak my grief, nor will time cure
The wound this parting gives. Disconsolate,
Till death relieves me, I must still endure
In silence; yet, whatever be my fate,
Thou well wilt be. remembered, and for thee
My daily prayer shall rise for grace divine;
Thine only, through all change, I'll ever be,
And thou the image at my worshipped shrine!?
She ceased to speak, and one long, deep-heaved, sigh
Was the faint echo of her heart?s despair;
Then, for the loved one, whom she soon must fly,
To Heaven she directed fervent prayer;
Prayed to that God who doth all good bestow,
That He would guard the object of her love ;
And grant, were bliss denied them here below,
That they should meet in happier realms above.
In fond embrace they both, enfolded, clung,
Lip joined to lip, each beating heart to heart,
As pure and holy as e?er yet hath sprung
From aught that love and guilelessness impart.
A moment ?twas of concentrated joy,
When Truth gives warrant for such earthly bliss;
Its sweetness heightened by one sad alloy:
It was the last?they ne?er again would kiss.


And so they parted! O, ?twas hard to part!
Soon came the torture they had dreamed of first;
No more spake they; each throbbing, o?ercharged heart
Deprived its tongue of speech, tho? it might burst.
Far as the light allowed, their anxious eyes
Sought each dear object, till it faded quite
In cruel distance, which their strength defies;
Then ?twixt them stands an everlasting night?
An endless night?with no succeeding day;
From fondest dreams they both at last awoke,
But waking brought them not one cheering ray?
No joyful gleam upon their spirits broke.
The sun of all their happiness had set;
From them, Hope?s beam had vanished evermore.
Much pain had both been spared had they ne?er met;
But there was sorrow yet, for him, in store
For she, so framed for tenderness and love,
Could not withstand that tempest of the mind
That wreck of all her hopes; and?like a dove
(O?erpowered by the fury of the wind)
Which vainly tries, ?mid elemental strife,
To reach the . shelter of its welcome nest,
Then yields, despairingly, its timid life??
Her spirit winged its flight to join the blest.


And, in that land where naught is known but peace,
Her weary, o?erwrought, spirit sought to find
A balm for ev?ry wound ?a sure release
From ev?ry pang which could afflict the mind.
Her last words were of him, so loved, so left?
In prayer for him, employed her latest breath:
In twain her sorrow-laden heart was cleft;
And Love?s abode became the home of Death,
And he, forsaken now, and sad and lone,
How bore he then, the loss of all held dear?
Not they can tell who have not sorrow known,
Who have not felt the anguish of a tear!
O?er her last resting place, by willows crowned,
Who now can tell what bitter tears he shed?
And who could doubt the grief which thus is found
So hopelessly expended for the dead?
For oft ?amid the silence of the scene,
With none to witness, save the stars above;
None near to mock his grief, or come between,
To turn his thoughts from her he so did love ?
Hath he repaired unto her lonely tomb,
And wept o?er ruined hopes and pleasures fled;
Yet, in submission, bowed him to the doom
That o?er his life a with?ring blight had shed.


Yet he was not alone; for, by his side?
In robes of radiant whiteness all arrayed?
The form of her was still his heart?s dear bride,
Stood o?er the mound ?neath which his hope was laid:
?Weep not!? the Spirit said, ?nor grieve thou more;
But take from Faith this firm assurance, dear:
Whom now you mourn hath only gone before
To welcome you to where is known no tear.?
Years after this, the man was sometimes seen
Alone, and ling?ring near the hallowed spot;
Himself and it, the seas oft rolled between;
But, far or near, this place he ne?er forgot.
There he would loiter, checking baneful weed ?
Or tending flow?ring plant with pious care;
Yet to his occupation few gave heed,
And none disturbed his lonely ramble there.
Of what befell, if you would learn the cause,
One word will answer to explain it here:
Obeying Nature?s ?braving social?laws,
He dared to love one far above his sphere.
The only wealth he had was wealth of mind?
A pearl of value oft outbid by gold;
To ev'ry virtue Mammon had been blind,
And priceless love was bartered for and sold.


He ventured but to lift his eyes above
His humble lot to where she sat enthroned,
By wealth surrounded: theirs the crime of love;
And amply now had they that crime atoned.
One, snatched by Death from all she prized and feared;
The other, wrung by anguish and regret,
And robbed of all that life to him endeared,
The misery his to live and not forget.
But, if they ne?er had met, they ne?er had known
The bliss that till this time ?twas theirs to know;
Had they ne?er loved, not theirs the chance to own
Some recompense for ills our fates bestow.
Ah, no! believe that all our sorrows here
Are mingled with our joys, as wholesome leaven,
Lest earthly pleasures we might hold so dear,
As to divert our thoughts from those of Heaven.
Do we regret possession of that sense
Which to the mind doth soft delights impart;
Or would we willingly with it dispense
Because we suffer from some painful smart?
If we could banish mem?ry, fearing pain,
Then with it all our pleasures would depart;
Tis wiser ruled that mem?ry should remain,
That neither feeling should control the heart.


Oh, Time, thou great developer of schemes!
Could we but look into thy vast abyss,
We should not build our hopes on youthful dreams.
Or from our present, count on future bliss.
The wildest thoughts that e'er the mind conceived,
The fairest fancies e?er indulged by youth,
The flattering tales of Hope we once believed,
All fly before the time-unfolding Truth!
What most we prize, is oft the soonest lost;
What most we hate, the closer still doth lie;
What valued is beyond all earthly cost ?
What most we love ?the soonest, sure, will die.
Our bright anticipations fade away,
Like morning?s mist before the rising Sun;
And old age finds us, at our close of day,
E?en as we were when youth?s career begun.


CONCLUSION.
?My story?s done,? the Stranger softly said,
And fixed his eyes intently on the ground;
Yet, all concluded, in that story read,
The speaker by the strongest link was bound.
To their enquiries made he no reply,
Though much by them solicited to speak;
While some, more curious, thought they could espy
A tear-drop stealing down his care-worn cheek:
But what availed it, in that story told,
Of whom 'twas spoken, or to whom applied,
Since all that had awakened it was cold,
And Grief enjoys what still its shame would hide?
But few, of those who heard, had sorrow known;
But few had felt the jealousy of Grief,
Which darkly rears its solitary throne
And lives a vassal where it reigns a chief.


And, while they pondered, evening's softened shade,
With misty mantle, overspread the stream;
And, peering through the trees, adown the glade.
Ihe rising moon aslanting shed her gleam.
Far upward in the azure-vaulted dome,
Aurora half restored the light of day;
And sad they felt from such a scene to roam;
But then the hour forbad much longer stay.
Yet stood they, rapt in wonder, to admire
The noble arch that spanned th? eternal blue ?
An arch of crimson?fringed with golden fire,
All mellowed with the violet?s softer hue.
From out the convex radiated spears,
The inner rim reposed on pillars grand:
The former pointing upwards to the spheres,
The latter resting lightly on the land.
A picture ?twas in which all hues, combined,
Appeared distinct, e?en while they seemed to blend
Each showing clearly, yet none quite defined;
Without a marked beginning, or an end.
Unlike the rainbow?s pale and limpid light?
Whose beauty is no less, though quite its own ?
Aurora?s field, so vast and heavenly bright,
Seemed where a God might choose Him for a throne.


The work completed, lengthened pause ensued,
As if Heaven?s artisans had ta?en a rest;
While Eurus caught the fragments they had strewed,
And wafted them towards the darker west.
Then, with fantastic shapes, the fleecy clouds
Rolled upwards from the earth, and stood between ?
Aurora mantling now, in silver shrouds,
Till of her splendour nothing could be seen.
So they on board their ample boat embark,
Which swiftly down the glassy river glides;
So softly, too, that naught her wake doth mark,
Nor scarce a ripple murmurs at her sides.
Again the merry jest and song go round,
Their tuneful voices ringing thro? the night;
For grief, with them, no resting-place had found,
No eye was there but sparkled with delight.
But, ere they reached their homes, a sombre bank
Above th? horizon in the west appeared;
The trembling stars into the darkness shrank;
The wind, with sudden shifting, westward veered;
The moon her task resigned to lightning?s flash,
Which ?forked and flamed ?illumined all the sky;
While thunders, bursting with tumultuous crash,
Now rolled and rumbled in the air on high.


Cloud beckoned cloud, and, meeting from afar,
An instant halted, then combined their powers;
In fury joined the elements in war,
And spread o'er earth their flood-creating showers;
Then, in brief while, they stopped their drenching rain
The moon and stars resumed their wonted sway;
And?Nature softened into calm again
The friends, rejoicing, went upon their way.
Rut where was he who, for a moment, threw
Upon their mirth a thoughtful, sadd?ning shade?
Just as he came, he went; and no one knew
The way he took, or when he left the glade;
But, as the happy day came round each year,
Those who survived repaired unto the vale;
Yet, ?mid their sports, and merry Christmas cheer,
They ne?er forgot the Stranger, nor the tale.
