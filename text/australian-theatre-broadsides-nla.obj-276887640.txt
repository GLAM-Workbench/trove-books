“ What’s in a name ? ” growled the
Hon. William Shakespeare, as he and
Colonel Francis Bacon were discussing
things one evening in the Dew Drop Inn.
“ Several volumes,” replied Bacon, in
a prescient tone, which indicated that he
had visions of Ignatius Donnelly.
Jess: “I can’t understand why she
hasn’t been married long ago. She’s
really pretty.” Tess: “ Perhaps she
wants to pose as a matchless beauty.”
Dick; “He married, did he? Well,
some fellows don’t know when they’re
well off.”
Jack : “ Well, in this case he knew the
girl was well off.”
Written by Harry B. Smith. Music by Ludwig Englander.

“ Do you imagine a poor fellow like
you can have any chance to win such an
heiress as Miss Snodgrass is ? ”
“ Well, I don’t know. Things look
rather favorable. Her mother withdrew
from the parlor at eleven o’clock last
night, leaving us alone.”
Little Bobby; “Papa, what’s a sank
tarium ? ”
Mr. Hadaliver : “ It’s a place where,
after you’ve been there a week, you wish
you were dead; and after you’ve been
there a month, you think you never were
alive before.”
“ They say that Mr. Snickers is a
professional humorist, but I have never

said Mrs Mcßride. “ Oh, it’s against

Mr. Mcßride.

Henpeck; “ But she can. I have never

Beauty unadorned may be mostadorned;
but, fortunately for the milliner and the

Pat: “ Shure an’ he’s got a job in a

“Papa,” said little Percy, “Why doesn’t
mamma travel with the circus?” “Why ?”
Mr. Henpeck asked ; “ what could she do
in a circus ? ” “ She might be the strong
woman. I heard her telling grandma the
other day that she could wind you round
her little finger just as easy as nothing.”
A minister’s little daughter and two
little boys, the sons of commercial travel-
lers, were talking about their respective
fathers, and what they did. One little boy
said :—“ My papa sells shoes.” The other
said—“ Mine sells paper,” and turning to
the little girl, “ What does your papa sell?”
For a moment the child hesitated, but, not
to be outdone by boys, she replied with a
grand air—“ My papa sells talk.”
The ten-year-old daughter of a portly
lady “seemed overjoyed when her mother
promised to take her to a concert on the fol-
lowing evening, and, rushing off to her little
writing-desk, produced a dainty diary, and
made a few notes in it. “ I should dearly
like to see what the darling girl has con-
fided to her diary,” said the mother to her
husband, when the child had gone to bed.
“ What do you think? ” “ Oh, t read it by
all means,” he answered. “ It’s sure to be
something sweetly innocent.” So the
portly lady, not without a few qualms of
conscience, opened the newly blotted
entry, which read as follows :—“Tuesday
—Am going to the concert to-morrow
with mother. Wish I could leave half of
her at home. It's so uncomfortable to sit
on the edge of a chair all night.”
No thin woman can afford to lose her
temper. “ Nothing,” says a good au-
thority, “ will make you so angular or give
your face such an undesirable look as the
free indulgence of your own will.” A girl
who was thin to a really painful degree
gained thirty pounds in sixty days on the
following regime Twelve hours’ sleep a
day; a well ventilated and cold room to
sleep in, with lots of fresh air all night;
light down coverlets for warmth, and hot
w r ater bags at the feet if they are cold ;
loose, light clothing at all times, with
plenty of space about the chest, shoulders,
and waist; a diet of cereals, cocoa, fresh
fruit, and starchy vegetables, potatoes,
beans, &c., milk and cream —everything
of a warming, fat-producing nature in the
' ''f food ; warm baths, though not too
frequtudy.

The Prompter who loses the place.
The recent production of “ The School for Scandal ” by
Miss Nance O’Neil’s Company calls up many memories of
the artists who have been seen in the principal characters in
New South Wales. Sheridan’s beautiful comedy was first
produced at the Theatre Royal, George-street, Sydney—a
theatre whose very existence is now almost forgotten—on
January 26, 1835. Lady Teazle was impersonated by Mrs.
Jones, a very popular actress of the time, while Mr. Knowles
played Sir Peter. Joseph Surface and Charles Surface
were entrusted to Messrs. J. Simmons and Peat. The
second production was on September 5, 1839, Mrs. Thomp-
son being Lady Teazle ; and the third was on June 5, 1843.
Both these were at the Victoria Theatre. The last-named is
peculiarly interesting because it occurred during the first en-
gagement of Mr, and Mrs. George Coppin, who played Sir
Peter and Lady Teazle respectively. There have been many
Lady Teazles since then, including Mrs. Guerin, Mrs. Charles
Poole, Miss May Howard, Miss Florence Colville, Mrs. Scott
Siddons, Miss Adelaide Bowring, Miss Surtees, Miss Ada
Ward, Miss Minnie Walton, Miss Helen Ashton, Miss Myra
Kemble, Miss Rose Osborne, Mrs. Brough and Mrs. Bernard
Beere. The Sir Peters included Messrs. G. FJ. Rogers, B. N.
Jones, J. J. Joyce, Morton Tavares, Fred Lyster, J. J. Welsh
and J. F. Cathcart, while Charles Surface has been played
by Messrs. Barry Sullivan, F. Belton, W. Hoskins, G. D.
Chaplin, J. J. Bartlett, Sothern, Wybert Reeve, H. N.
Douglas and Otho Stuart.

THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS IN THE EATING.
Mary’s Trials and Triumph.
‘ Shame on you, George,’ thus spoke his spouse,
And sad tears with her voice were blended ;
‘ This is the way you keep your vows,
And thus your vaunted love has ended.
‘ Scarcely a year has passed away
Since these your vows of love were spoken,
But vows and promises, they say,
Are made, like piecrust, to be broken.
* Now not one word of love you give,
No smiles, no kisses, or caresses ;
And every weary day I live
Your coldness my poor heart oppresses.’
‘ Mary,’ said George, * you need not scold ;
Stay your reproaches for a season.
I may, perhaps, be cross and cold,
But, wife, I have sufficient reason,
‘ How do you think that I, whom you
With your vile cookery is killing,
Can smile and kiss, and bill and coo,
When pain through every nerve is thrilling?
‘ Look at the pastry, cakes and bread
You place upon this breakfast table ;
Say, to digest such lumps of lead
Is any human stomach able ?
‘ You quote a proverb to me, but
About your piecrust ’twas not spoken,
Y ours might with axe or saw be cut,
But could not, like a vow, be broken.
( \
A WORD TO
YOUNG WIVES,
Be Wise and remember the
aphorism that ( The road to a
man’s heart lies through his
stomach.’ Therefore, do not
imperil your husband’s affec-
tion by upsetting his diges-
tion, when by reading the
marginal verse and profiting
by Mary’s experience, you can
ensure his undying devotion.
‘ Now, mark this, Mary, if love’s flame
Has vanished like a bursted bubble,
Yours is the fault, you are to blame ;
Your cookery has caused the trouble.’
‘Oh, George,’ said Mary, ‘say not so,’
And here her voice began to soften,
‘ls mine the fault? Well, well, you know
I have tried hard, I have tried often.
‘ To make light cakes and bread and paste,
But trying always ends in failing,
Constant disaster, loss and waste
Prove all my efforts unavailing.’
‘ The fault is yours, and yours alone,’
Said George, and here his voice grew louder,
‘ Nor can I such a fault condone,
You will not use WAUGH'S BAKING
powder:
‘ I’ll try it George ; I will, indeed,
Lest constant broils our hearts should sever. ’
She tried it, praying to succeed ;
Success at once crowned her endeavour.
No trouble now with cakes or bread,
No fear the pastry is not rising,
No longer sodden lumps of leads,
Bat viands light and appertising.
And no dark cloud of storm and strife
Now rises o’er the breakfast table.
Mary, a fond, a happy wife,
To cook to George’s taste is able.
And George, so all his neighbours say,
Of his dear wife grows daily prouder ;
While both for ever bless the day
When first she used WAUGH’S BAKING
POWDER.
ALWAYS THE PUREST AND BEST.

The Parisians have a new insurance

Two East-enders were discussing the war news.
“ I say, Bill, who’s this ’ere Warren ? ”
“ Why,” said the other, “he was a copper once. Charlie
Warren, don’t you remember ? ”
The other reflected for a moment, then he said, medita-
tively ;
“He never copped me. Which was his beat ? ”
“Were you really happier before you became civilised ?”
asked the white man.
“ Well,” answered the Pacific Islander, “ I must say I
didn’t have all this worry about whether my trousers were
getting baggy at the knee.”
Moody and Sankey are said to have

“Well, father,” exclaimed the prodigal
son, as he made his appetence at the
family fireside, “ are yon ready to kill

“ That deaf mute guide *seems to be-
well acquainted with the institution,” said
the visitor.
“ Yes, indeed,” replied the superinten-
dent. “He has everything at his fingers’
ends.”
His Friend: “Didn’t yer fust cigar
make yer feel bad ? ” He : “I dunno,-
I was too young to remember.”
The British South Africa Company has
