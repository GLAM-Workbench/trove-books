THE ORIGINAL
CHLORODYNE,
Invented by EICHAED FEEEMAN, Pharmaceutist.
ONE OF THE
GREATEST
DISCOVERIES OF THE PRESENT CENTURY.
It immediately relieves, and in most cases
cures, Consumption, Coughs, Colds, Influenza,
Bronchitis, Asthma, Hooping Cough, Diarrhoea,
Dysentery, Cholera, Spasms, Cramps, Rheuma-
tism, Gout, &c., he.—See Medical Testimonial.
In Cholera, Diarrhoea, and Dysentery its
effects are most signal. It relieves pain, spasm,
and cramp, supports the system, keeps up the
warmth of the surface and extremities, at the
same time moderating the action of the bowels.
Conclusive evidence of the value of it in these
affections is afforded by the followingfrom
The Right Honourable Earl Russell, who
graciously transmitted to the Inventor of Chlo-
rodyne, Mr. R. Freeman, and to the Royal
Codege of Physiciansof London, the following; —
Extract of a Despatch from Acting-Consul
Webb, dated Manilla, Sept. 17th, 1864;
“ The remedy most efficacious in its effects {in
Epidemic Cholera) has been found to be Chlorodyne,
and with a small quantity given to me by Dr. Bubke
saved several lives.”
FREEMAN’S ORIGINAL CHLORODYNE
Cm I I produces therapeutical effects which are pecu-

xrtE I other preparations bearing the name of Chloro-
dyne. Eminent and scientific physicians made
,s that they have tested its effects in
comparison with those of ‘ ‘ Dr. Collis

A LARGE STOCK ALWAYS ON HAND,


ELECTRO-PLATE is an article the quality of which can only bo tested
by actual wear. To insure themselves a good article, purchasers
have hitherto been forced to buy only well-established brands, and as a
matter of course to pay enormous prices for the name of the old manufac-
turers. By way of remedy, Messrs. HANDS & SON have opened up a trade
upon a principle (which they trust for many years to stand by) of giving
the consumer a good, durable article at moderate cost, reserving only a
fair manufacturers’ profit. The greatest care will be taken to collect the
prettiest and newest designs, so that in bringing their goods permanently
before the public they do so with the full determination that nothing
offered in their class of goods shall ever
SURPASS THEM.
All they ask for is public confidence, and they in their turn will give the
public
EVERY POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE.
Large stocks are always on hand for wholesale purchasers at Messrs.
Levy Brothers’ Stores, Melbourne, and constantly replenished by the
newest articles and patterns as they are brought out.

FROM THE LONDON PRESS.
The Times suggests the necessity of an immediate return to commercial
consistency. BREIDENBACH’S MACASSARINE OIL is equally
wonderful to that sold at 3s. 6d.
Morning Post, Pall Mall.—A Bright Idea.—“ The London Trees

TRANSPARENT CEMENT.
ESTABLISHED TWENTY YEARS.
UNDER DISTINGUISHED PATRONAGE.
For Repairing Broken Glass, China, Earthenware, Marble, Mother-of-Pearl, Ivory,
Wood, Bone, Jet, Inlaid Work, Toys, and Ornamental Articles of almost every
material and description ; Tipping Billiard Cues, and in every case where a
STROUG AMD DURABLE CEMENT
IS REQUIRED.
THOMPSON'S CEMENT
WILL BE FOUND TO SURPASS EVERY OTHER.
The advantages of this Preparation are its Great Adhesive Power, Facility and
Cleanliness of Application, Durability, and Cheapness, in which qualities it
stands unrivalled. It will be found a most valuable domestic requisite, as by its
aid broken articles may be joined and rendered serviceable, which would otherwise
be thrown aside as useless.
TESTIMONIALS.
From the Earl of Sbfton, Croxteth.
X have to thank you for the bottle of Cement. It is a most excellent article. I
have taken several bottles to friends at a distance from this place, and it has been
most highly approved of, particularly by my cousin, Lord Craven, who is much
employed in mechanical pursuits, and who purchased six bottles at your shop on
Thursday last. Ho pronounces it to be the best thing of the kind he knows.
From T. C. March, Esq., Lord Chamberlain’s Office, St. James's Palace. London.
I have found the Cement most excellent and useful, and its qualities by no
means overstated.
From Mr. T. C. Archer, Higher Tranmero, Cheshire. March 27,1852.
Gentlemen I have used the Cement manufactured by you in many ways, with
the greatest success. At present lam engaged in making a Collection of Com-
mercial Products for His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and in fitting up
the Cabinet have found it so serviceable that I consider it the best Cement ever
manufactured.
From Mrs. Calvert, Liverpool Toy Warehouse, 103 Bold-street. March, 1852.
Sir—l have extensively tried your new Cement for repairing Toys, and am
very much pleased with it. It makes a firmer joint, is so very readily used, and
so cleanly in its application, that I much prefer it to Glue, or any kind of Cement
I have before used. It will prove quite an acquisition to private families, and I
shall have the greatest confidence in recommending it.
FOS BILLIARD CUES.
From Me. John Roberts, Union Club, Manchester.
I thank you for the Cement you have sent me. I have tried its qualities to the
fnllest extent, and I find it better than anything I have ever used for the Tips of
Billiard Cues. I have no hesitation in saying it only requires to be known to
become generally used by Billiard Players, and I shall feel great pleasure in
recommending its use among my friends and others upon every opportunity.
ANY ARTICLE REPAIRED WITH THIS CEMENT WILL BEAR WASHING IN HOT WATER.

Notes of the Calendar for 1870.
Golden Number 9 I Dominical Letter B

Solar Cycle 3 | Julian Period 6583
The year 5631 of the Jews commences on September 26th. The year 1287 of the
Hegira commences on April 3rd. Ramadan (Turkish month of abstinence) commences
on N ovember 25th.


Sun’s Rising and Setting.—These numbers show the mean time when the sun’s
centre, elevated by refraction, appears on the horizon, the eye being on a level with
that plane.
Moon’s Rising and Setting.—The same as for the sun, only that the moon is
more depressed by parallax than elevated by refraction. When the mark — occurs,
it shows that the moon will only rise or set that day. Thus, on the roth of January,
the moon will only rise at Melbourne. This arises from the lunar day being longer
than the solar. The moon, it will be seen, sets on the gth at thirteen minutes before
midnight, on the next night she will not set till fourteen minutes past midnight—
that is, after the commencement of the nth.
Phases of the Moon. —The times are here given to the nearest minute when the
moon is respectively o°, go”, i8o°, and 270° of longitude from the sun. Apogee is the
time of her greatest distance from the earth, Perigee of her nearest approach.
Sun’s Declination.—These quantities show the angular distance of the sun from
the equator, measured on a meridian. They are given for apparent noon, or the
instant of the sun’s transit over the meridian of Melbourne, and are very useful
for determining the latitude by meridian altitudes, for which they will serve.
without reduction, sufficiently near for most nautical purposes, the whole of the
Australian coast. Thus, suppose on the 1st of January the altitude of the sun’s
lower limb at meridian transit had been observed to be 73“ 22', the height of the eye
being eighteen feet above the sea, and the instrument having an index correction of
+4', the computation will stand thus

Explanation of the Calendar.
Latitude .. .. . ... S 39 24 17
The proper way of applying the declination may be easily inferred from the circum-
stance that the sun is vertical when on the meridian of that place whose latitude is the
same as the declination. As the sun was observed to be 16° 22' 5" north of the zenith,
the place of observation must be situated so much to the south of where the sun was
vertical; if the sun had been observed to the south of the zenith, the latitude would
have been 6° 40' 7" S. If the above observation be made on the meridian of Mel-
bourne (145° E. of Greenwich), the latitude thus obtained will be quite correct; for
any other meridian the declination would require a correction, which might be easily
obtained by interpolation, thus —as 360° : diff. of long. : : diff. of declination in 24
hours; the correction required. But the maximum error of latitude caused by the
neglect of this correction will be less than two miles, and will be generally much
smaller between the limits of Cape Leuwin and New Zealand.
The Sun’s Semi-diameter is used to reduce an observation of his limb to his centre.
Equation of Time. —This is the difference between true solar and mean solar
time ;it is used to find the latter from an observation of the sun. Thus, suppose on
the Ist of January a sun-dial, or any other solar observation, gave the time 2h. 36m.,
to get the mean time (which is that shown by a well-regulated common clock or
watch) we add 3m. 435., which makes the mean time ah. 39m. 435. If the observation
had been made at noon, we should have added 3m. 405., the same as in the column ;
but for any other time than apparent noon we ought to apply a correction, which may
be found by interpolation. For common purposes, however, the equation at nearest
noon will be sufficiently exact.
The Right Ascension of the Mean Sun is the angular distance in time of
the mean or fictitious sun from the first point of Aries at mean noon. It is the side-
real time at mean noon, or that which should be shown by a sidereal clock when the
mean-time clock points to 12 at noon. It is used to find the mean time when the
sidereal t ime is known, or the converse. Thus, suppose the right ascension of Sirius to
be 6h. 39 m. 255., this therefore will be the sidereal time when Sirius is on the meridian;


subtracting from this the sidereal time at the previous noon, we shall have the interval
of sidereal time that has elapsed since the preceding noon ; which, by means of the sub-
sidiary table, given for the conversion of sidereal into mean solar time, may be
easily reduced into an interval of mean time, as in the following example : —Suppose
that on the ist of January an altitude of Sirius had been observed which showed that
the star was 3 hours to the east of the meridian, the sidereal time would therefore be
311. 39m. 255.; subtracting from this ißh. 42m. 95., increasing the former by 24 hours,
we get Bh. 57m. 16s. for the sidereal interval since noon; subtracting from this ini. 285.,
we have Bh. 55m. 48s. for the mean time of the observation. By means of the table
of Semi-diurnal A res, the times of rising and setting of the heavenly bodies may be
found in a similar manner. If the right ascension of the true sun is required, it may
be found by applying the equation of time to the right ascension of the mean sun.
Thus on the ist of January the right ascension of the mean sun is ißh. 42m. qs., and
that of the true sun is 1811. 45m. 495.
The Moon's Age is the interval elapsed at mean noon since the last new moon :
it is given in days and decimal parts of a day.
Moon’s Meridian Passage. —This is the mean astronomical time at which the
moon’s centre passes the meridian, or due north of Melbourne. It is very useful for
finding the time of high water. The symbol eS near the time of new moon shows
that the moon will not pass the meridian on that day, the astronomical day beginning
at noon, twelve hours after the commencement of the civil day.
High Water at Williamstown.- —The time of this table is civil mean time. It
has been calculated for Gellibrand’s Point, on the assumption that the change tide
takes place at ah. 31m., as deduced by Captain Cox, R.N., the late Admiralty Sur-
veyor, from a discussion of the tide-gauge papers for the year IS6O. When the
mark occurs there will be only one tide that day. Thus on the 14th of January
there will be only a morning’s tide. The times here computed may be taken as the
average ones when high water may be expected ; the tides at Port Philip, however,
are so influenced by winds and other causes, sthat the actual times of high water will
sometimes differ from the calculated ones by more than three hours. The supple-
mentary table for the outports has been taken from the Government Gazette, June
22, 1858.
Duration of Twilight. —This table shows the time taken by the sun to move
from 18 0 below the horizon to sunrise, and to the same distance after sunset, when
his rays cease to illuminate the sky.
trom is below the horizon to sunrise, ana to the same distance alter sunset, when
his rays cease to illuminate the sky.

To Speaker’s Gallery, Assembly,
Vaccination.— The Deputy-Registrar of Births and Deaths must, within
twenty days after registration of any birth, give notice to the parents or
guardian to have the child vaccinated, specifying the days and hours when
the Government Vaccinator attends forthe purpose. Parents and guardians
refusing to attend to such notice are liable to a penalty of from £2 to £5.
Registration of Births and Deaths.— The parents of a child born
or deceased, or the occupier of a house in which the event takes place,
must give notice thereof to the Deputy-Registrar of the district. Births
should be registered within 60 days after birth ; and deaths before the
funeral takes place. The Deputy-Registrar should give certificate of
registration to the undertaker, and attest place and date of interment.
Stable Floors. —Three bushels of sifted coal ashes, mixed with two of
good lime, and made into stiff mortar with tar or liquid asphaltum, the
whole spread on a level bed of small stones, well rammed down, makes as
good a floor for a stable as can be devised—better than planks.

STATISTICAL REGISTER OF VICTORIA.
Population of V ictoria. —The population of the colony on 31st De-
cember, 1868, was 684,316, being an increase of 24,429 during the year,
while the net gain by immigration was 7253. It was estimated that there
were 271,788 persons on the goldfields, of whom 64,658 were miners, being
little more than one-half the number engaged in this occupation in 1859.
The estimated population of the corporate towns and boroughs was 343,590,
and of the shires and road districts, 306,889. In the former, the value of
the rateable property was computed to be £21,503,942, and in the latter
£22,628,604. The revenue of the corporate towns and boroughs exceeded
half a million sterling, while that of the shires and road districts was cal-
culated at a quarter of a million. There were 73,476 dwellings within the
limits of the first, and 62,412 within those of the second.
The Victorian Railways. —The debenture capital bearing interest at
the close of 1868, irrespective of the new loan, was £8,618,100; the net
revenue of the lines for the year was £298,426 ss. 5d., or 3'46 per cent,
upon the capital ; while the gross receipts were £581,402 19s. Bd., being
an increase of £30,000 on the revenue from the same sources in 1867.
The number of passengers carried in 1868 was 943,327, or a decrease in
round numbers of 158,000 upon the number carried in 1867, while that
fell below 1866 in this respect.
Industrial and Reformatory Schools.— ln the year 1868 there was
a net increase in these schools of 226 Industrial and 5 Reformatory
children. The net cost per head was £22 12s. 6d., including cost of
transport and head office.
Proportion of Insane to Total Population op Victoria.— The total
number of insane in the public asylums in Victoria on Ist January, 1868,
was 1280 ; the estimated population, 659,887 ; giving the ratio of 1 to 515,
or 1 94 in 1000. Up to the latest date at which the comparative calculation
can be made, the proportion of insane to the total population of this
colony is considerably lower than in England. During the year 1868 the
number, of insane in the asylums increased from 1280 to 1556. Assuming
that the ratio of increase in the general population of the colony has not
been greater during 1868 than during 1867, it is probable that the propor-
tion of insane has now nearly reached the English average.
Schools and Scholars in Victoria.— Comparing 1868 with 1867, there
was an increase of 18 schools in operation, 5308 children on the rolls, and
4840 in average attendance.
Postal Revenue and Expenditure.— The postal revenue for 1868
amounted to £119,280 4s. 2d., showing an increase, as compared with 1867,
of £5253, or about 4 2-sths per cent., but less by £11,278 than that for
1866, and £19,527 less than in 1865, owing to the reduction in the inland
postage. The gross expenditure for 1868 amounted to £209,151 19s. 9d.,
showing a deficiency of £89,871 15s. 7d., as compared with £80,414 3s. Id.,
the deficiency in 1867.
Post-office Money Order and Savings Banks.— The number of
money orders issued during 1868 was 73,222, against 68,712 issued in 1867
—an increase of 4510. The number of money orders paid was 61,656,
against 57,787 in 186/—an increase of 3869. The value of the money
orders issued was £247,484 os. 7d., against £237,317 9s. 7d. in 1867—an
increase of £10,166 11s. The value of money orders paid was £214,025
15s. 4d., against £205,622 18s. 6d.—an increase of £8402 16s. lOd. The
number of new Saving Banks accounts opened during 1868 was 6540;
closed, 3302; remaining open on 31st December, 14,356. Deposits
received during 1868 were £184,115 4s. 6d.; repaid, £125,565 10s. 7d.
The interest placed to credit of depositors for year was £4435 19s. 3d.
The balances to credit of depositors on 31st December was £166,061
3s. 4d.

(^lntuarp—lB6B-9.
Bowie, Robert (October 3, 1869, aged 82 years), surgeon. Mr. Bowie
was one of the oldest medical practitioners in the colony, and was
for many years Surgeon-superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum, at
Yarra Bend.
Evans, Hon. George Samuel, LL.D. (23rd September, 1868), some time
editor of Herald newspaper, and for several years a member of the
Legislative Assembly, in which he was distinguished for the classical
and oratorical character of his speeches. He was twice a member of
Governments of which Mr. O’Shanassy was the head, having held
the respective offices of Postmaster-General and President of the
Board of Land and Works. He died at Wellington, New Zealand.
Fawkner, Hon. John Pascoe (September 4, 1869, aged 77), the Father
of the Colony. As a boy he was among the first Europeans who
trod the soil which now is called Victoria. As a man he founded the
city of Melbourne. He was forty-three years of age when he erected
his first hut on the green slopes of the Yarra, and during the subse-
quent thirty-four years he witnessed changes which, looked back
upon, must, in spite of the active part he took in bringing them
about, have appeared magical. In all good works his exertions were
prominent, and when an abuse raised its head no blow was more
direct or vigorous than his. He was a town councillor when there
was no other representative body in the colony, a member of the one
House of Legislature when the colony possessed but one, and a senator
as soon as a senate formed part of the Constitution. He was a mem-
ber of the Legislative Council up to the time of his death.
Ferguson, Charles (December 27, 1868, aged 55), for many years Chief
Harbour-master of Victoria—a position in which he was highly
respected and esteemed.
Frankltn, Francis Burdett (January 1, 1869). Mr. Franklyn came to
Melbourne sixteen years ago, and began business as a printer’s
broker, and was for some years one of the proprietors of the Herald
newspaper. He was highly esteemed for his many amiable qualities
by a very wide circle of friends.
Hill, Rev. William (May 13, 1869), was an esteemed minister of the
Wesleyan denomination. He arrived in the colony from India in
1854, held successive appointments in our largest centres of popu-
lation, and was for some time Editor of the Wesleyan Chronicle, a
position for which his literary attainments and classical taste emi-
nently fitted him. He was murdered, while in the discharge of his
ministerial duties, at the Pentridge Stockade, by George Ritson, a
life-prisoner of the Crown.
Kyte, Ambrose (November 16, 1868, aged 46 years), arrived in the colony
in 1840. From very humble circumstances he advanced to the posses-
sion ol considerable wealth, and distinguished himself by several
munificent donations to stimulate useful enterprise and promote the
interests of Victoria. He was for some years a member of the
Legislative Assembly.
Plunkett, Hon. John Hubert, M.L.C., N.S.W., and Q.C. (May 9, 1869,
aged 68). Mr. Plunkett was the first Attorney-General appointed for
the Australian colonies, and held that position for nearly twenty-four
years.
Tomato Jam. —To make tomato jam, take 1 lb. of loaf or white crystallised
sugar to a pound of fruit; boil for at least four or five hours, keeping it well
stirred. Some strain through a colander, others prefer retaining the skins.
Proceed as with other jams.


Farmers' antr Gardeners' Calendar.
.1 A NVAK Y.
KITCHEN GARDEN. —This month is generally too hot and dry to
admit of much being done in gardening operations, except in low
moist situations, where cropping can be carried on almost at any time.
Where water is plentiful and easily applied, young crops should be watered
once or twice a week, care being taken that the soil bo well stirred with
the Dutch hoe after every watering. If rain or dull weather occur, a few
cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, broad and kidney bean, lettuce, pea,
onion, radish, and turnip seeds may be sown to a limited extent; with the
exception of the peas and beans, all the seeds should be slightly protected
from the intense sun by shading with calico, litter, or some other suitable
material. Early potatoes should be planted, for use in April.
Flower Garden.—Dahlias and roses should be looked after ; the former
requiring staking, disbudding, mulching, and watering; the latter to be
pruned when necessary, so as to give a fine autumn bloom ; decayed flowers
should be removed, and every means used to render the plant vigorous.
Carnations should be layered. Chrysanthernurns, phloxes, and other
herbaceous plants will want staking and thinning.
Farm.—Farmers will be busy harvesting the grain crops; when the
ground is cleared, lose no time in ploughing or scarifying the stubbles to
destroy weeds, and if the weather permit, turnips might be sown, and
would yield good feed for sheep, and a good dressing of manure. Man-
golds, carrots, and other root crops must be kept clean by horse-hoeing.
FBBBCABY.
Kitchen Garden.—Cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, spinach, and turnip
should be sown. Early potatoes may be planted largely. Celery and
leeks to be transplanted into trenches. Dig up any vacant ground in
readiness for- autumn cropping ; the soil is pulverised and sweetened by
exposure to the atmosphere. Cabbage and cauliflower plants should be
planted largely. If dry, water as last month.
Flower Garden.—Proceed with the propagation of favourite plants by
layering, cuttings, or otherwise. Plant at the end of the month a few
hyacinths, tulips, anemones, ranunculi, and narcissi for early blooming.
Sow stocks, larkspur, mignonette, Ac. Take care that camelias, azaleas,
rhododendrons, and the like plants, do not suffer from want of water.
Climbers must be regulated, the stronger growing kinds cut back, and
others neatly tied up. All decayed flower stems or leaves to be removed ;
walks to be kept neat and orderly.
Farm.—The plough will be in active use this month, unless the weather
is very unfavourable. Sow turnips for sheep—also oats, Cape barley, rye,
and tares for green feed. Continue the use of the horse-hoe amongst
drilled crops. Look to your manure heap, collect everything that is
convertible into manure, and when thoroughly rotted, cart on to your
land.
MARCH.
Kitchen Garden.—Sow cabbage, cauliflower, early horn carrots, broc-
coli, lettuce, peas, radish, spinach* and turnip. Kidney potatoes may still
be planted. Earth up celery. Top-dress asparagus beds with salt or sea-
weed. If new strawberry beds are required, plant runners as soon as you
can obtain them ; three-year-old beds should be destroyed.
Flower Garden.—Dahlias, hollyhocks, liliums, and Pompon Chrysanthe-
mums will now be in their prime ; liquid manure will prolong and enhance
the beauty of these flowers ; dead blooms must be picked off, or the plants


will be impoverished. This is the best month to sow hardy annual and
perennial flower seeds. Prepare your ground for planting shrubs, orna-
mental trees, &c.; if not already trenched, get it done at once. Her-
baceous plants can be divided, and planted where wanted ; carnations
and pinks may still be propagated by cuttings under a bell glass. Keep
all weeds down.
Farm.- —Ploughing will chiefly occupy the farmer’s attention. Plough
deep—the extra expense is trifling compared with the benefits derived.
In some districts wheat-sowing will commence ; see that the finest and
cleanest samples of seed are selected, and do not neglect to dress by using
a solution of blue vitriol, at the rate of 1 lb. to the sack. Sow lucerne.
Cape barley, rye, oats, tares, and Californian prairie grass. This is the
time for preparing land to plant live fences in—quick or whitethorn hedges
are the best; the ground should be ploughed and subsoiled.
A I* II I 1,.
Kitchen Garden. —Finish manuring and digging ground ere winter
sets in. Take care that young crops of turnips and carrots are kept free
from weeds. Continue planting out cabbages, cauliflower, and celery ; the
latter would be much benefited by an occasional dose of guano water.
Sow peas (early varieties), broad beans, onions, parsley, endive, radish,
and spinach. Plant potato-onions, shallots, garlic, rhubarb, and horse-
radish. Earth up celery as required. Look to your herb bed; where
necessary, divide the roots, and make fresh plantations. If strawberry
runners were not planted last month, let them be this.
Flower Garden. —This is one of the busiest months in the year : most
kinds of evergreens, and ornamental and flowering shrubs, are best trans-
planted now, and any alterations that are to be made in laying out
grounds should be commenced. Take up gladioli, liliums, and other
bulbs that have done flowering ; store them away in boxes packed in dry
sand. Finish planting hyacinths, tulips, crocuses, narcissi, anemones,
ranunculi, ixias, &c., &c. Renovate edgings of camomile, thrift, box, and
thyme. For new plantations of roses the ground should be trenched and
heavily manured; if light soil, some stiff loam should be incorporated with
it. Propagate by cuttings any kind of soft-wooded plants you wish to
increase ; bell or hand glasses are required for this purpose.
Farm.- —Oat sowing will commence in some places, but in cold districts
May or June are better months. For green feed, sow Cape barley and
oats : .lucerne, clovers, and grasses of all sorts may also be sown,
previously testing their germinating powers by sowing a sample in a
flower-pot, that expense and disappointment may be averted. Young
crops of barley, oats, &c., would be much benefited if a pair of light harrows
were run over them. Potatoes should be lifted and stored, as they are
liable to a second growth if left in the ground.
M A V.
Kitchen Garden.— Asparagus, rhubarb, and sea-kale beds will want
cleaning and manuring. Sow broad beans, peas, lettuce, onions, radish,
and spinach for succession al crops. Plant out early cabbages and late
sowings of celery. Finish manuring and digging all vacant ground,
whether wanted for immediate use or not; bear in mind that turning
over ground in a wet state does it more harm than good. If ground is
wanted for other purposes, carrots, parsnips, and other tap-rooted
vegetables may be taken up and stored.
Flower Garden. —As dahlias and hollyhocks die off, the stalks should
be cut down and cleared away ; the former being taken up and housed in
a dry shed or cellar. Look over your seedling, annual, and other plants,
thin them where thick, and keep slugs and other vermin away. Prune


perpetual flowering, banksian, and other spring-blooming roses. Continue
planting evergreens and flowering and ornamental shrubs ; stake the same
when necessary. Propagate by cuttings fuchsias, roses, &c. Attend to
hedges, keeping them well clipped ; if new ones are required, use
hawthorn, furze, osage orange, or acacia, where strength is required ; if
light small hedges are wanted, the small-leaved prickly acacia, Cape
broom, sweet brier, or pittosporum, are the best.
Farm. —Complete wheat-sowing; also sow barley, beans, oats, peas,
rye, and vetches for seed. Finish sowing grasses, clovers, and lucerne.
Store turnips and mangolds if ground is required for other purposes.
JUKE.
Kitchen Garden. —Get all heavy work in the most forward state possible.
This is the best month for planting all descriptions of fruit trees ; trench-
ing and deep draining are essential to their well-doing ; if soil is poor and
manure be needed, use bone dust in preference to guano. Commence
pruning fruit trees, beginning with those which have lost their foliage.
Sow to a limited extent cabbages, cauliflowers, broccoli, early carrots,
lettuces, and radishes. Make good sowings of broad beans, peas, and
leeks. Finish planting garlic, shallots, horse-radish, rhubarb, sea-kale,
and asparagus.
Flower Garden. —lf possible, finish planting all kinds of trees ; choose
calm dull weather for the purpose of transplanting, and take care that the
roots are mutilated as little as possible. This is a good time for sowing
grass seeds for lawns and borders. Dig neatly your flower beds, adding
if necessary a little well-rotted manure. Finish pruning roses, flowering
shrubs, &c. Old rose stools that have been standing for years should be
taken up and replaced with young vigorous plants.
Farm. —Sow barley and oats largely either for hay or seed. Continue
sowing beans and peas. Prepare land for mangolds, carrots, potatoes,
maize, sorghum, chicory, tobacco, &c. The deeper the ground is worked,
the better will be the crop. On rainy days, numerous jobs indoors may be
done, such as mending and making pig troughs, hurdles, gates, &c.
JILT.
Kitchen Garden. —Plant largely of early potatoes ; sow parsnips upon
rich deep soil—the latter ought to have been trenched two feet or more.
Sow peas largely—Bedman’s dwarf, blue imperial, Champion of England,
Burbidge’s eclipse, climax, and alliance are among the best for general
purposes. Sow largely of the various kinds of broad beans in rows thirty
inches apart. Established plantations of rhubarb and sea-kale may be
forced by covering the crowns over with pots or slates, and covering these
again with fresh horse-manure. Plant globe artichokes in rich soil, in
rows four feet six inches by three feet. Sow main crops of onions, also
spinach, radish, and small salads.
Flower Garden.—lf former directions have been carried out, there
will not remain much to be done this month, with the exception of
keeping all the walks, borders, and beds neat and clean.
Farm.— Continue ploughing .and harrowing lands intended for spring
cropping. Hoe drilled crops. Continue sowing grasses, clover, lucerne,
and peas; beans may still be sown in late localities. Oat and barley
sowing should be completed this month if the weather has been at all
favourable.
AUGUST.
Kitchen Garden. —This month will close the season for planting fruit
trees, &c., so that all diligence must be used. August is the chief month
for sowing seeds of various kinds—such as cabbage, cauliflower, carrot,
leek, lettuce, onion, parsley, parsnip, peas, radish, spinach, salsafy, and


corz onera. If frames are obtainable, make up hot-beds for early
ucumbers, melons, vegetable marrows, &c. Tomatoes may be sown in
pots in a frame for planting out in October. Plant Jerusalem artichokes
andmain crop of potatoes. Plant out cabbages, cauliflowers, leeks, onions.
Flower Garden. —If the manuring and digging of the flower garden be
not completed before now, it should be attended to at once. Tall growing
annuals will require tying up. Propagate fuchsias, chrysanthemums, and
climbers from cuttings. Repot plants commencing growth and wanting
pot room. Dahlias for early flowering may be started in a little bottom
heat; seedling nemophilas, larkspurs, clarkias, &c., may be transplanted
if too thick.
Farm. —Potato planting may be commenced now, but September is the
principal month for getting in the main crops. English barley can still be
sown. Oat and wheat crops should be rolled. Prepare land for sorghum,
beet, and mangold crops.
SEPTEMBER.
Kitchen Garden. —This is the busiest month in the year for seed sowing
—most of the hardy vegetables may be sowm, and towards close of month
all the tender sorts. Potatoes of all kinds should be planted for main
crops. Make a sowing of peas for succession. Early longpod beans may
still be sown in low-lying ground. Sow scarlet runnners, dwarf French
beans, beet, carrot, cucumber, melon, vegetable marrow, pumpkin, onion,
radish, and spinach; mustard and cress should be sown every fortnight;
sow' celery on a hot-bed. Tomatoes and capsicums may be sown in warm
situations ; if any have been raised in a hot-bed, harden a little and plant
out. Plant Chinese yams and sweet potatoes in well-trenched soil. Fruit
trees will require attention ; with the finger and thumb displace any
superfluous shoots, and if time can be spared, the blossom buds should be
thinned, especially of young trees.
Flower Garden. —The floriculturist has generally numerous insect
pests to annoy him in this month, such as green and black fly, red spider,
scale, and thrip, to say nothing of slugs, caterpillars, &c. Gishurst’s com-
pound will be found the best remedy for the former. Plant out calceolarias,
cupheas, geraniums, heliotropes, pansies, salvias, &c. Sow both tender and
hardy annuals.
Farm. —Sow carrots, chickory, maize, mangolds, parsnips, and tobacco.
Plant potatoes. Lucerne and grasses can still be sown. Keep the horse-hoe
at work between drilled crops, and plough in weeds on fallow ground.
OCTOBER.
Kitchen Garden.— lf season is moist, carrots, leeks, onions, and pars'
nips may still be sown. Sow largely of kidney beans, early turnips, capsi'
cums, tomato, cucumber, vegetable marrow, pumpkins, melons, and parsley ;
also tall-growing varieties of peas—they will not grow very high at this
season of the year. Plant out largely cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and
celery; also, sow again for succession. Weeds will grow apace ; ohoose a fine
sunny day for hoeing them down, and rake off when withered, or perchance
a shower may come, and a great number of them start into growth again.
Flower Garden. —Balsams, cockscombs, globe amaranthus, zinnias,
and other tender annuals should now be sown, if not already done ; if
sown in pots, and transplanted into flower beds, place in sunny weather
an empty flower-pot over the patches of young plants; remove the pots
every evening, or the plants will grow, up weak and spindling. Climbers
will be growing fast, and will require constant trimming and training.
See that flower bods are kept filled by turning out large plants in pots.
Farm.—This is the last month that potatoes can be planted, except in
low-lying lands. Sow largely of maize and sorghum ; mangold sowing
should also be completed. Earth up early crops of potatoes with double-


breasted plough ; do not delay this operation too long or you will injure
the fibres.
IV' O V E M 1! E R.
Kitchen Garden.—Bods of rhubarb and sea-kale that have been forced
should be cleaned off. Cease cutting asparagus, or you will weaken the
roots. Attend to cucumbers and melons ; if any have missed, sow again,
Stop leading shoots of cucumbers, to induce laterals. If tomatoes are not
planted against a wall or fence, they should be tied up to strong sticks,
and pruned moderately, or fruit will be small and few. This is tht time
for preventing a great deal of pruning in winter; use the finger and thumb
judiciously in disbudding and stopping fruit trees ; thin the fruit where
thick ; increased size and superior flavour will be the result. Vines will
require frequent attention as regards training, tying, and thinning shoots.
Flower Garden. —Hybrid perpetual roses should have their shoots
pruned back immediately they have bloomed. Newly-planted shrubs or
plants suffering from hot sunshine should be protected by boughs of
tea-tree or wattle. Empty casks, with both ends knocked out, make very
good shelters, although rather unsightly. At close of month, budding-
may be proceeded with. Flower seeds can still be sown, although with
greater risk of their well-doing than if sown earlier.
Farm.—ln some districts harvesting will have commenced, and farmers
generally will have little time to attend to growing crops of mangolds,
potatoes, &c.; but if the weeding and hoeing of these are neglected, they
will soon tell tales. Maize and sorghum may still be sown.
»E€EM B E R.
Kitchen Garden.—Cabbage, cauliflower, brnssels sprouts, and savoy may
be sown in shady places; peas, kidney beans, lettuce, spinach, and turnips
can also be sown, but not to any extent. Onions, carrots, and parsnips
will require thinning and weeding. Matured onion bulbs should be
harvested at once, or the sun will injure them for keeping. Plant out
early celery plants in trenches, and give abundance of water when
established. Early potatoes for seed, when ripe, should be taken up and
greened, by exposing them to the atmosphere for a few days, under the
protection of a shed or verandah.
Flower Garden.—Bulbs that have flowered and died away should be
taken up and packed in dry sand. This is the best month for planting
out dahlias for autumn blooming. Roses and fruit trees may be budded.
Newly-planted shrubs and trees will be benefited by having some rotted
stable straw spread on surface of soil, which should first be well stirred.
Farm.—Wheat harvest will be getting general in earlier districts : both
wheat and oats should be cut before being thoroughly ripe. English barley
should be fully ripe before being cut, in order that when used for malting
it may all sprout at once. Hoe and earth up potatoes.
X Bff E VIUE.
An east or north-easterly aspect is best fn>- the vine ; next best is the
north ; south-east may be good ; the west i - the worst aspect of all. The
vine will succeed in almost any soil, but flourishes best in a deep,
calcareous, light ground ; it will thrive in any soil composed in part or
whole of volcanic debris, mixed with gravel or sand, and resting upon a
limestone formation. The best manure is bone dust, but in naturally
good soils no manure is needed. Trenching the ground is absolutely
necessary if large crops, fine fruit, and good flavour are desired ;if a
retentive clay bottom, two to two and a half feet trenching will be
sufficient, but if a fine loose porous subsoil, three feet will be better.
Draining is also essential to the well-doing of the vine, unless the ground is


well drained naturally. The distance at which vines should be planted
from each other depends somewhat on the soil, for if planted upon poor
hungry land, as a matter of course they will not grow so strong and
luxuriantly as they would on good rich soil. The trellis will no doubt
supersede all other modes of growing, when it becomes more known than
at present; the heaviest crops, the finest fruit and of the best quality,
are produced by this system. Plant the vines eight feet apart between
the rows, and twelve feet apart between the plants in the row ; one-year-
old plants are best. The majority of German and .Swiss vignerons plant
their vines much closer than the plan just mentioned —viz., five or six
feet apart from row to row, and only two feet apart in the row ; others
again plant them four feet apart each way ; an acre planted thus will
contain about 3100 vines. The best time for planting vines is from the
beginning of June to the end of August, or in late seasons they may be
planted up to the middle of September.

Grass and Clover. —The following are the sorts and quantities of Grass and
Clover Seeds suitable to most soils, but the quantity of either kind can be
increased or reduced, attention being paid to the nature of the soil and subsoil,
so as to ensure early growth, with good bottom, nutritive qualities, succession,
productiveness, and permanency:—Per Acre : 12 lbs. Perennial Rye Grass. 14 lbs.
different kinds of Fescues, 4 lbs. Cocksfoot, 2 lbs. Foxtail, 2 lbs. Rough-stalked
Meadow Grass, 2 lbs. Wood Meadow Grass, 3 lbs. Timothy, 1 lb. Sweet Vernal —
total, 40 lbs. Grass Seeds; with 2 lbs. White Clover, 2 lbs. Red Clover, 2 lbs. Red
Perennial or Cow Grass, 2 lbs. Alsike, 8 lbs. Clover.
Manures. —The following are the quantities of the undermentioned manures
generally applied to an acre of ground of ordinary quality2o tons farm-yard
manure ; 10 cwt. crushed bones; 5 cwt. crushed bones and 1A cwt. guano : 3 cwt.
Peruvian guano. 2 ozs. of guano to the gallon of water, or one part of cow-dung
to ten parts of water, are customary proportions for liquid manure.
Treatment for Seeds supposed to have Lost their Germinating Power.—
Steep the seeds in water with a grain or two of oxalic acid, and sow. Or place
them in a temperature of seventy degrees, laid on flannel; turn twice a day,
keeping them moist and at a regular heat, being the state most favourable to
germination; sow at the end of twenty-four hours. lodine facilitates the
germination of seeds; put a small quantity in the water with which they are
watered.
To Grow Celery in Winter.—Have the drills ranging north and south, or
near those points so that the sun strikes the drill with full power. Manure with
a compost of turf and loose dung, which enriches the soil and keeps it light. For
the winter crop the manure must not be worked deep in the trench, but should
be us abundant in the ridge as in the drill, encouraging the roots to ramify all
through the upper and warmer soil of the ridge. Allow three feet for earthing.
Melon Jam. —Cut the melon into small pieces, and to every pound of melon
add three-quarters of a pound of white sugar. To every ten pounds of melon put
two lemons; pare them, and cut the peel into very small pieces ; remove the
pith and cut up the inside before mixing. Then add one ounce of whole ginger to
every ten pounds of melon, which must be well bruised and placed in a muslin
bag, and boiled with the melon until flavoured to taste. The whole to be boiled
five hours, and kept well stirred. This jam is strongly recommended to the
useful housewife, as being a cheap and wholesome substitute for butter, and
more suitable than butter for children’s use.
Mosquito Bites. —The following preparation reduces the pain and swelling:—
Extract of belladonna _A drachm; glycerine, A oz.; water, 8A ozs.


Favourite Flowers and their Cultivation, w
The Pansy comprises many beautiful varieties, all of which ‘ ‘ sport ” most freely
into myriads of diversifications of new forms and tints. The beauty of pansies
depends much on their cultivation and mode of treatment. In order to insure a
constant succession of bloom through the summer, a bed should be prepared with
good rich mould, about the month of March, in which young plants, that have
either been struck from cuttings or side shoots, should be placed about
nine inches apart. The flowers will begin to show themselves about the middle
of September, at which time the soil about the roots should be pulverised, and if
the weather is dry, water should be freely applied. A succession maybe obtained
from cuttings (which will readily take root if planted in a shady situation), for
the purpose of making new beds or replacing the old ones.
The Pink is a hardy flower, and no garden need be without it, for it will grow
readily in any tolerably dry and weU-cared-for soil. If the soil of the garden be
not suitable, a mixture of yellow loam, garden soil, and well-decomposed stable
manure, about one-third of each, with some road-grit to keep it open, makes a
good compost. Plants for early flowering should be put out in beds the first
week in .Tune, and successional plants later in the month. About twelve inches
apart is a very good distance when permanently planted out. A top dressing of
well-decayed manure ought to be applied early in spring, to bring the plants
forward for booming. As the plants spindle for bloom, only three or at most
four stems ought to be allowed to remain on each plant. These should be tied
to neat stakes', and as the buds appear, only three or four should be left on each
stem. In dry weather, water freely; in hot weather, shade the plants if extra
flue blooms are desired. The pink is readily increased by pipings, planted in
light sandy soil; when rooted, put into store beds lor transplanting as desired.
The Polyanthus only succeeds in the more temperate portions of the
Austra’ian continent, as it is extremely susceptible of injury from long-continued
heat; therefore the most sheltered situations should be chosen. New varieties
arc raised from seed, which may be sown in small pots in June or July, covering
the seed lightly with soil, and the covering closed with glass. The plants will
make their appearance in about six weeks ; when large enough, transplant into
other pots, watering very sparingly. Polyanthuses make nice borders or edgings
in suitable localities: elsewhere they should be shaded, or kept in pots in a
frame. The best soil is a light sandy loam. To have flowers of a fine size, thin
out all superfluous buds. Those in the centre are the best to take away.
The Anemone is generally planted in March, the tubers being covered with
about two inches of a light sandy soil. When the plant appears above the
ground, and when coming into bloom, if the weather be dry, water moderately.
The beauty and continuance of the flowers will be promoted by judicious shade.
Window Gardening.—Of hyacinths, for blooming indoors, either in pots or in
any of the various contrivances that are used instead of pots, strong bulbs should
be selected and placed in succession. Place them in any dark, cool situation for
three or four weeks, to allow of their making roots before exciting them into
growth. If pots are used, and these are doubtless the best, if not the most
ornamental, use good rich sandy soil, and secure perfect drainage, for a liberal
supply of water is required during the blooming period.
Gladioli.—This class of beautiful bulbous plants cannot be too strongly
recommended to all lovers of gay flowers. They are equally well adapted for the
autumn decoration of flower gardens, either in beds or borders, and of continuous
development when cut for the flower-vase. Any common garden soil will suit
them it enriched by digging in a little well-decayed stable or cowyard manure ;
but the soil should be moderately deep and open, to allow the roots to descend,
and be well drained.
Phloxes. —About beginning of October take the strongest shoots from the old
plants, and root by placing in hot-bed, such as is used for propagating dahlias.
When rooted, plant in pots, and repot as required. Plant out in rich soil by end
of November or beginning of December, and affording slight protection until
established, watering liberally, both while growing and when in bloom. They
bloom in March and April, and the plants are at their best in the second season
of flowering. The principal points to be observed in phlox culture are dw'arfish-
ness. fine foliage, and large heads of flowers.
Mignonnette is universally esteemed for growing in boxes or flower-pots,
particularly in town windows; and although generally treated as an annual,
yet if prevented from flowering too profusely, by pinching off most of the
flower-spikes, it will attain the size and habits of a small shrub, and last in
bloom for a lengthened period.

SAFETY DAMP-PROOF MATCHES.
Chemical and Igniting Surface Fire-proof Boxes.
THE SAFEST OF THE SAFETY.
The only Chemical Safety Preparation on Safety Tin Boxes.
SUPERSEDES ALL OTHERS
SPECIAL NOTICE.
The Patent Safety Damp-proof Safety Matches, in Tin
Boxes, arc chemically prepared without Sulphur or other ingredient
emitting a noxious odour. To ensure a greater safety, and for the
better Prevention of Fire, they arc sold in Tin Boxes, by which means
they are preserved from damp.
Wet-proof ! Damp-proof !—Should the preparation become
corroded after use, its igniting properties may be renewed by simply
wiping it with a damp cloth.
Unlike the ordinary Safety Match Boxes, the composition of which
can be readily remover! by damp (and which, being highly deleterious,
is dangerous in the hands of children), the Patent Safety Match
Box is perfectly harmless, the preparation being fixed by heat, and
cannot be removed without great difficulty.
MOST IMPORTANT TO EXPORTERS.
There is not the slightest danger or risk in the transit
of these Matches, either by Rail, Steamer, Ship, Canal,
or Carrier, either at home or abroad, the Boxes keeping
the Matches perfectly free from heat or damp.
Purchasers are respectfully requested to inquire for
“THE SAFETY DAMP-PROOF IN FiRE-PRBOF MATCH BOX,"
And see that each hox bears the trade-mark of

CHAMPION
QUININE WINE
BITTERS.
The finest Tonic and most delightful Bitter known. Its
delicacy of flavour and general excellence has secured it
pre-eminence amongst all similar preparations.
Report on Cordials, See., for Messrs. Levy Brothers.
I hare examined several samples of Cordials and Syrups manufac-
tured by Messrs. Levy Brothers, with a view to determine their
purity and excellence.
I found them to be genuine, well compounded, and of good flavor
On examination of some of the more important materials used in the
manufacture, I found them to be of the best quality and free from
contaminations.
I may select for particular mention The “ Champion Quinine
Wine” and the “ Orange Bitters)” as being superior articles of their
kind. The former contains a sufficient quantity (nearly \ grain in
a wineglassful) of pure Quinine. The flavoring -matters of both are
perfectly wholesome.

ALIZARIN.

ALIZARIN
GENUINE ALIZARIN INK.
The incomparable qualities of this famous Ink have induced many
imitations under a similar name, all of which have proved unsuccess-
ful, while the “ Genuine Alizarin Ink,”' from possessing the
qualities of a perfect copying as well as writing Ink, has so steadily
increased in public estimation as to have become almost universal.
Asa copying Ink it is incomparable, as it does not, like other Inks,
require to be immediately copied, but it can be perfectly done several
days after, and will be as legible as the original. As a writing Ink
it is famous for its intense blackness, which never fades. It is in-
valuable for public or other documents that require to be legible for
a lengthened period of time, and is used in all Government Offices on
the Continent, on account of that necessary quality. It can be used
with any kind of pen, as it does not corrode; it never moulds nor
leaves sediment; and should any Ink be left, by the time when dried
up, a little water added to it will make it again useful, and as in-
tensely black as before, quite contrary to all other Inks. Exposure
to air increases its blackness; and from not wasting, it is really
economical, as well as an incomparable, Ink.
