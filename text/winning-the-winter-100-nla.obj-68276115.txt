After winning the Winter 100, I desire
to pay tribute to the outstanding qualities
of Leggetts Dynamic Spark Plugs. I chose
them because I was determined to win.
I listened to them to the first corner, felt
the bite of maximum power, and knew
I could forget them. They are certainly
wonderful plugs.
?WINTER IOO?

AVERAGING 74.2 m.p.h, and a top
speed of 110 m.p.h., with engine revs,

(M. G. Magna) by skilful driving and
daring cornering at high speeds, won the
?Winter 100? at Cowes by a clear 54 secs,
and gained fastest time of 1 hour 20
minutes 46 seconds.
Out of 22 entries , 15 started and 8 only
completed the distance . Six of these icere

The hot, intense spark of Leggett Spark Plugs gives instant ignition,
resulting in easier starting, more miles per gallon, sweeter running
and dynamic power. Change to-day for a POWER of difference to
engine efficiency.
