INTRODUCTION
Sir Arnold Wilson, M.P.
Englishmen have a deserved reputation for fair-mindedness:
they are proud to be known as a people who are prepared to hear
both sides. The destruction of Guernica in April last was but
an incident in a dreadful war. The like fate which had befallen
other towns had passed almost unnoticed; they had admittedly
been maliciously destroyed by fire but it was not suggested that
aerial bombardment had played any part. The case of Guernica
aroused emotion not because of the consequent loss of life or
property, but because we in this country were led to believe that
it had been destroyed suddenly, for no military reason, by aerial
bombardment ?a danger to the reality of which our own eyes
had but recently been opened.
The news of the destruction of Guernica, and the statement
that it was the direct result of an air attack on a market day,
was contained in a telegram to The Times from its special corre-
spondent, Mr. G. L. Steer. The wording suggested that he had
been an eye-witness of the events which he described. Subse-
quent messages made it clear that he had not in fact been within
many miles of Guernica at the time of its destruction, and that he
had relied for his vivid narrative upon the panic-stricken reports
of refugees. He did not, on his own showing, reach Guernica
till 2 a.m. on April 27, some six or six and a half hours after the
alleged bombardment had ceased, and even then he was not
allowed in the centre of the town. Having claimed that it had
been destroyed by air, Mr. Steer stuck to his story, and has since
published a book in which, without adducing any new evidence,
he repeats his version of the event.
The Government of Salamanca claimed from the outset that
Guernica had been destroyed by fire, by the retreating forces of
the Madrid Government, on and after April 26 when the advance
fines of the Nationalists were within four mi les of Guernica. They
have since appointed a technical Commission to inquire into the
circumstances surrounding the destruction of the town. This
book is the English translation of their report, here published for
the first time and now submitted to the judgment of English
readers. A little of the evidence is hearsay, but most of it, unlike
iii


INTRODUCTION
much of Mr. Steer?s and of other contemporary chroniclers, is
first-hand.
Let us deal first with the findings about which there will be
universal agreement.
(i) The Commission declare (page 15) that Guernica was
destroyed by fire.
This is borne out by Mr. Steer?s statement of April 27 that the
towm was flaming from end to end, and that the reflection of the
flames could be seen from ten miles away. There was little or
no wind to carry the flames from house to house. The fire was
therefore not accidental.
(2) The loss of life on April 26 was less than too persons.
The evidence for this is partly negative, but is in general ade-
quate to support this conclusion, and no evidence putting the
casualties substantially higher has been brought forward even
by Mr. Steer. Assuming this figure to be approximately correct
it strongly suggests that aerial bombardment cannot have played
a large part.
(3) The Tree of Guernica, the Parliament House, the Con-
vents converted into military barracks and the arms and
munition factories in and near the town were undamaged.
This is substantially in accordance with Mr. Steer?s report in
The Times of April 28: ?A factory producing war material lay
outside the town and was untouched. So were the barracks,
some distance from the town.? Mr. Steer concluded that the
bombing of the town was an act of senseless ferocity aimed at
defenceless citizens. It was, however, even on the facts originally
available, equally consistent with the theory that the retreating
Asturians, though willing to destroy most of the town, were
unwilling to destroy their own headquarters.
(4) Guernica was bombed by aeroplanes intermittently
between 4.30 and 7 p.m. on April 26.
(5) Guernica was occupied at the time by the armed forces
of the Basque Government.
That the war correspondents who hastened to Guernica from
Bilbao at midnight of the 26?27 April and found the town in
flames should, that night, have concluded that the fire was the
result of a terrible air bombardment was natural. Some bombs
had fallen. One of the correspondents, Mr. Steer, had seen the
bombers that very afternoon. Fragments of one or two incendiary
bombs were picked up. What is surprising is that, on the 27th,
the same story should have been repeated, because the complete
immunity of certain prominent and historic sites was so incon-
sistent with the theory of destruction from the air that it should


INTRODUCTION
have prompted an immediate re-investigation. The explanation
for the repetition of this story is, however, clear enough. The
stories of the refugees added what appeared to be circumstantial
details of the severity of the air-raid, and the town itself was still
burning, so that a careful examination, either of representative
witnesses or of the fabric was at the time impossible. This
Report, however, gives the further conclusions resulting from
this essential investigation:
(6) There is direct and unassailable evidence that, at the
very most, only a quarter of the town was on fire at 8 p.m. on
April 26 after the last aeroplane had, by common consent, dis-
appeared. There is also clear evidence that certain houses,
some of them isolated, found burnt on the 29th, were not
burnt at all on the 26th, but were set alight on the 27th or 28th,
and actually in one case on the 29th.
(?) There is direct and unassailable evidence that explosions
were heard through the night of the 26th-2yth, It is common
ground that no aeroplanes were on the scene at that time.
(8) There is widespread and direct evidence of a most (in
a legal sense) satisfactory character that from 8 o?clock on the
26th onwards no effort to extinguish the fire was made or
permitted by the militia. At that time less than a quarter of
the town was burning. The fire could therefore have been
stopped.
The evidence under these three heads is comprehensive.
The witnesses examined by the Commission were for the most
part present and on the spot after 8 o?clock on the evening of the
26th. Their testimony therefore is direct and satisfactory evidence
of what they themselves saw and heard. The evidence that the
Republican militiamen prevented the checking of the fires is
very strong. 1 There is confirmatory evidence 2 for their various
statements, and for subsequent cases in which buildings caught
fire after the original outbreak. The evidence here is compre-
hensive, and the witnesses appear reliable and intelligent.
(9) There is weighty circumstantial evidence to show that
the main destruction to the streets was caused by subterranean
1 See Miranda?s evidence on p. 26, Diez on p. 27, Dona Arana on p. 28, Nicolas
on p. 29, Inchausti on p. 31, Larrinaga on p. 33, Guerricabeitia on p. 33, Egara on
pp. 36-7, Musatadi on p. 39, Uriguen on p. 40, Isusi, the stationmaster, on p. 41,
Arechederreta on p. 43, Menarguez on p. 43, and Arana on p. 50.
Note the case of the house of Lopez de la Calle, referred to by several witnesses:
Senora Goiti s house, the Vasca Tavern and the house of Senor Ascondo. Note
also the outbreak of a fire after the entry of the Nationalist troops, which was
extinguished by them. Note also the evidence on p. 33 as to the looting by militia-
men, and the evidence of Nicholas on p. 29 that the fire which broke out in one of
the sheds of the Talleres (the munition workshops) was extingushed by the work-
men, but that attempts to do the same in the centre of the town were not permitted.


introduction
explosions at nine points, adjacent in every case to the man-
holes of the main sewer.
To accept the contrary view is to assume that these, the only
?bomb holes? (so-called) in the streets of Guernica, were caused
by aerial bombs which, in each of the nine cases, droppe , as
the result of nine coincidences, the same distance trom the on y
nine manholes in these streets. The technical evidence as to the
effects of a subterranean explosion, as compared with those ot
an explosion caused by the dropping of a bomb from the air, is
corroborative. . c ~
(10) Although it was a market day, Guernica was not lull
on the day of the raid, April 26th, for arrangements had already
been made for its evacuation and some at least of the inhabi-
tants had been warned to absent themselves.
The conclusions to be drawn from the facts summarized under
these headings are clear and unmistakable. By far the greater
part of the destruction worked in Guernica was the deliberate
work of the retreating forces, and that part, if any, which was
the result of the air raid of the 26th could have been localized
and, in so far as the fires were concerned, substantially mitigated
by prompt action on the early evening of the 26th.
I commend this report, precise and, in parts, highly technical,
to the earnest attention of all Englishmen, and particular y to
those who, as politicians, as journalists, as speakers and writers
or as men of affairs, are concerned in the creation and guidance
of that public opinion on whose health and sanity our free
institutions depend. .
The lesson which it teaches is no partisan doctrine, it is a
strikingly frank document and bears on it the impress of truth.
The Commission of Inquiry does not discuss the rights and wrongs
of air warfare. They pass no judgment either on those airmen,
of whatever nationality, who dropped bombs on the two Basque
battalions sheltering in the town, or on those others who carried
out the major part of the work of destruction. They have been
content to establish facts, and they have established a formid-
able array of them, which necessitates a revision of views already
formed by all partisans, both those who have hitherto denied
that there had been any air bombardment at all and those who
have hitherto attributed to such a bombardment the destruction
of Guernica.
Have these partisans?honest as I believe most of them to be


INTRODUCTION
the manhood to re-cast their views, in the light of the facts now,
as it seems to me, incontrovertibly established?
It is a test case. Feeling has run high on this issue. Reckless
judgments have been passed, and have been supported by the
reckless exaggeration of hearsay evidence. If in this and in
cognate cases, those concerned on either side cannot put them-
selves to this test, and emerge from it with candour and intelli-
gence, we, like too many others, must one day be victims to the
?alien frenzy? against which Wordsworth warned us just over
a hundred years ago.
Ex parte statements on current political or domestic issues,
commonly called propaganda, constitute to-day part of the
accepted procedure of commerce and of governments both at
home and abroad. We need not fear it provided that we retain
our ability to analyse, to judge and, when need arises, to revise
our judgments when fresh evidence becomes available.
Bias there must be; it is the common property of individuals,
of nations, and of every age. It is omnipresent and often,
perhaps usually, unconscious. It has its place in life and thought,
but not in arriving at conclusions as to facts. ?Truth,? as Pro-
fessor J. L. Morrison first said twelve years ago, ?is a jealous god
and not a judicious compromise,? and we must at least try to
recognize it.
There is not one of the conclusions which I have noted in this
preface which would not be held established by any English
Court of Law, none which, in the ordinary process of law, an
English jury would not hold to be proven.
The findings of the Commission go further than I have
indicated. They challenge, for instance, the photographs in-
cluded in the evidence published by the Basque Government,
Their comments on the burning of the Church of San Juan
(pages 11 and 12) are particularly striking, and their reasoning falls
little short of being conclusive. But I prefer to invite the atten-
tion of men and women of goodwill to the broad, clear and
simple facts, now conclusively established, in the hope that,
from reading this report, we may one and all learn, on the one
hand, how necessary it is to suspend judgment on ex parte state-
ments put before us with the object of leading us, on vital
issues and in moments of crisis, to erroneous conclusions, and
that we may all learn, on the other hand, to accept the logic of
facts, once established, however greatly they may differ from
our prehminary surmises or preconceived opinions.

REPORT
A Commission has been appointed by the Junta Tecnica del
Estado Espanol (Technical Department of the Spanish State) to
investigate the facts regarding the bombardment and destruction
of the town of Guernica. It is made up of Don Estanislao
Herran, civil engineer and member of the Commission for Public
Works and Communications, as President, and the following
members, Don Jose Usera Rodriguez, Magistrate of the Courts
of Justice of Pamplona, Don Tomas Pereda Garda, Magistrate
of the Courts of Justice of Vitoria, and Don Joaquin Garda
Tuhon, Chief Engineer of the Public Works of Biscay.
This Commission commenced the investigation by personally
visiting the town of Guernica to take the evidence of those per-
sons of all classes and conditions who were eye-witnesses of the
facts. At the same time a detailed tour of inspection was made
of the town, highways, streets, public squares and buildings;
various photographs were taken, and fragments of incendiary
bombs were picked up. The evidence and material so acquired
are embodied in this report.
The town of Guernica y Luno belongs to the Province of Biscay
and is situated thirty-four kilometres from Bilbao. It is bordered
on the east by the municipality of Ajanguiz; on the south by
Mugica; on the west by Rigoitia; and on the north by Forua.
Guernica has approximately 6,000 inhabitants and is situated in
a wide valley, on the eastern slopes of the Cosnoaga Mountain,
which runs down to the estuary of Mundaca. It is the chief town
of a judicial district and its communications with Bilbao and
neighbouring judicial districts are by means of seven highways:
those of Amorebieta, Marquina, Rigoitia, Ajanguiz, Malzaga,
Bermeo and Lequeitio, and by a narrow-gauge railway which
runs from Amorebieta to Guernica and Pedernales. Its situation
at the head of the Mundaca estuary which is fifteen kilometres
long, and of considerable width and fairly deep, make it necessary
for the communications between the towns at the east of Biscay,
such as Lequeitio, Marquina, Durango, etc., and Bilbao to pass
through Guernica in order to avoid the barrier constituted by
the estuary. This circumstance gives the town great importance
and makes it a nerve centre where many interests converge. At
Guernica itself the estuary is comparatively narrow, and can be


crossed by a bridge of three small spans, which joins the town
with the district called Renteria.
From this bridge, as can be seen by the accompanying plan,
starts the fan-like system of roads which lead to the east of Biscay
and through which, consequently, all the already mentioned
traffic has to pass.
The historic tree and the Casa de Juntas (Parliament House)
are situated in the higher part of Guernica, and here, as well as
in the lower part, adjacent to the river, are to be found the prin-
cipal buildings. From the accompanying map, an idea can be
formed of the general aspect of the town, the geographic position,
the distribution of the buildings and the situation of the public
squares, streets and boulevards. Naturally with such a small scale
it is not possible, without causing confusion, to give details of
each separate house, but such a differentiation would appear to be
unnecessary for the purpose of this report. Attention should be
called to the arms and munitions factories, called Talleres de
Guernica (Guernica Workshops) and Unceta y Cia, which are
close to the railway station, and the convents of La Merced,
Agustinos and Santa Clara, which were converted into barracks
during the Red rule.
The principal events dealt with in the present report took
place on Monday the 26th April, 1937, and continued during the
two following days, that is on the Tuesday and Wednesday, 27th
and 28th respectively. On Thursday the 29th, the soldiers of the
Nationalist army marched into the town and on the following
days the defeated Red army shelled the town and the Red aviators
attempted to bombard it. On the previous days the Mondragon
Vergara front had broken, and the enemy were in flight along
the roads from the east of Biscay in an attempt to reach those
entrenched and fortified positions called the Iron Belt of Bilbao,
which was believed to be impregnable. To reach this position
fugtives had to travel over the roads in the zone where Guernica
is situated.
Whilst these events were taking place, others of no less impor-
tance were happening in the town to the inhabitants of Guernica.
The Basque Government had decreed the evacuation of
Guernica for Monday the 26th. This is testified by Don Alberto
Onaindia, Canon of the Cathedral of Valladolid, a native of
Biscay, in some declarations which were published on page 3
of the pamphlet, Guernica , issued by the Basque Government.
Since these declarations were collected by the said Government
and were published as propaganda throughout the whole world,
there is, therefore, no reason to doubt the Canon?s testimony that


the Basque Government had decided to evacuate Guernica on
the 26th April. On receiving this news, Don Alberto Onaindia
motored to Guernica and arrived at the town on the said day at
4.50 p.m. The Canon states that the reason for this journey was
that he had relatives in Guernica and wished to save them from
the danger which he thought was imminent.
It is evident from other statements accompanying this report
that Don Alberto Onaindia was not the only person who had
news of the evacuation. One witness declares that on that day
his chauffeur and servants suddenly disappeared from the town;
another that on that same day the households of the separatists
and leftists left Guernica; a third that the cashier of a Basque club
also left with bags full of money. Many others, like the indus-
trial engineer Don Salustiano Olazabal Menarguez, on leaving
their houses in the afternoon, noticed with astonishment that
Guernica was almost empty. From time immemorial a very busy
cattle fair was held every Monday at Guernica, but on that Monday
neither the cattle nor the attendants at the fair were anywhere to
be seen. Sehor Menarguez visited the place where he generally
met his friends every day and found that nearly all had dis-
appeared. It is evident that the order for the evacuation of
Guernica was an open secret, and that those who from previous
experience knew of the consequences likely to ensue were most
anxious to escape them.
It is true that on that morning of the 26th some aeroplanes had
been seen flying over Mount Oiz, some fifteen kilometres south-
east of Guernica and that the alarm bells had rung; but as this
was a common occurrence it could not account for such a general
exodus as had actually taken place. There is no doubt that the
secret order for the evacuation, given by the Basque Govern-
ment, had been noised abroad and that those who knew of it
attempted to fly to safety.
An aeroplane appeared in the distance flying from the north-
east, that is from the sea-coast; some witnesses say at half-past
three in the afternoon and others at four. The witnesses do not
give any details as to whether the aeroplane was a monoplane or
biplane, or whether it had one, two or three motors; the account
of each witness varies as to the colour, and none can give any
information about its undercarriage, rudders, etc. If there are
contradictions and incongruities in respect of its shape and
characteristics, the confusion is greater when an attempt is made
to throw some light on what it did. Some say that it was alone,
others that it was not; some that it machine-gunned from the
ground, others that it did the machine-gunning from the air;


there are witnesses who declare that it dropped some bombs
round about the district of Renteria (see the map), others deny it.
In short, the appearance of the aeroplane or aeroplanes can be
taken as a fact, but nothing more can be learnt about them, nor
about what occurred afterwards in relation to them.
There also appears to be no doubt that the people, frightened
by the presence of the aeroplane and by the noise of its engine
or engines, hurried to the shelters. Up to a certain point, this
explains the confusion of the evidence, since from inside a shelter
nothing can be seen of what happens outside and what is heard
is confusing.
In view of the difficulty of definite evidence from witnesses who
were concealed in shelters and not in a position actually to see
what occurred above ground during those hours, the Commis-
sion decided on a personal inspection, with the following result:
Around Renteria, following the Lequeitio road and turning
towards the left, they found a number of holes shaped like funnels
or inverted cones, being some seven metres in diameter at the
base of the cone and some two or three metres deep, which had
the same appearance as those caused by the explosion of an aero-
plane bomb. These holes are marked on the plan.
Some were already full of stagnant and dirty water thick with
fungus and weeds produced by the damp and the heat. There
were several in the garden of the convent of La Merced and close
to the bridge of Renteria (across the River Mundaca) and to the
cross-roads which are visible in the plan. Similar holes can be
seen around the Ajanguiz road, and all that zone to the east of the
town where the Lequeitio, Marquina and Durango roads run.
There were also signs that an attempt was made to destroy the
road close to the Renteria bridge, since the surface has been
repaired and the inhabitants who witnessed our investigations
told us that, in actual fact, that afternoon of Monday the 26th,
the road was cut by a crater caused by an aeroplane bomb.
All these craters are outside the town of Guernica, close to the
bridge and to the cluster of roads which run from its eastern side
leading from Lequeitio, Marquina and Durango.
In the interior of the town the Commission was unable to find
any trace of a crater, although, had any existed, there are numerous
gardens and public squares where they would still have remained
as clearly visible as they are in the fields on the eastern side, where
is the cluster of roads mentioned. On the other hand, inside
the town zone may be seen signs of great explosions on the
roads, streets, public squares and boulevards. These explosions
must have been very powerful and destructive; but the holes


which they left in the ground have been filled in, the pavement
repaired, and only by close observation of this paving can the
recent and imperfect repairs be noticed as a large patch in the
road surface. Nine of these repairs have been marked on the plan.
The marks of the explosions having been obliterated, it would
appear, at first sight, difficult to conjecture how they were pro-
duced; but there is a strange peculiarity in their situation.
Whether they are in a great square, such as that of the Cattle
Market, or in a broad boulevard, such as that of San Juan, they
always coincide with a point of the lay-out of the drainage, and
appear always a few metres from a sewerage man-hole. These
man-holes cannot be photographed, but they are composed of
pipes or galleries in short lengths and of man-hole shafts. Between
each two shafts the piping is straight and the drainage has a
free flow. If at any point of these tubes or galleries a stoppage
should occur, the obstacle can easily be removed by breaking it
away with rods from the nearest man-holes. These shafts are
closed with cast-iron lids, such as that which the man in Plate 10
is indicating with his hand. In the foreground of this illustration
can also be seen the marks of the explosion. The lid which the
chauffeur is pointing out was easily raised in the presence of the
Commission with a tyre-remover; obviously with the proper in-
strument it could be still more easily opened. Once opened, it is
possible for anyone to descend the shaft and, from below, push
any desired object along a wire to a given point. Dynamite
cartridges, with detonators and fuses which would explode
the dynamite could easily be so introduced and reproduce
exactly the marks left by the explosions within the urban area of
Guernica.
This procedure could be easily carried out by anybody. But is
it feasible that an aviator could hit the exact mark in a village
square where the line of sewerage runs, and repeat this indefinitely
and always with the same success, while guarding himself at the
same time from attack from the ground and keeping his eye on
his objectives amid the smoke produced by the explosions?
Moreover, in the boulevard of San Juan one particular instance
calls for mention, where one of the explosions with which we
are dealing took place. The boulevard is some thirty metres in
width; the sewerage lies at one side, and there exactly the ex-
plosion occurred. Had the bomb been dropped from an aero-
plane it would have produced a characteristic crater; the facades
of the nearby houses would have shown the marks of the splinters;
the window-shutters and the balconies would have been bent and
twisted, as if they had been forcibly hurled towards the street


from the inside of the house; but nothing like this happened. In
the house of Don Jose Ecenarro, an estate agent, situated at
that point, something quite different was noticed. This house
is a bungalow standing alone in the middle of a garden. On
one side of the principal fa9ade is situated a square tower, and
as a result of the explosion this tower itself has taken a list,
having come apart from the rest of the building, as if by an
earthquake shock. If the explosion had occurred on the surface
of the ground this phenomenon could not have taken place,
inasmuch as above ground the wave of explosion rapidly loses
its energy and diffuses itself in the atmosphere; but, on the other
hand, if it occurs below the ground, the ground undulates, and
propagates this undulation like a seismic movement. The tower,
then, of which the centre of gravity is high, receives that undula-
tion and amplifies it, like the needle of a seismograph, and when
the motion becomes sufficiently strong this needle, so to speak,
breaks away from the rest of the building, which on account of
its lower elevation does not feel the undulation to the same extent.
This same explosion produced another analogous phenomenon.
In the centre of the boulevard is a bandstand. This stand is built
of dressed rubble, which has cracked as if from the effects of an
earthquake. No aerial bomb could produce such an effect.
Let us now examine the case of the shelter in Santa Maria
Street, which is situated where the utmost breadth of the street
is not more than twelve feet.
The shelter was not built underground, but on the surface,
that is to say on the roadway itself. Its general shape was that
of a gallery in a mine, with trunks or logs set up vertically at
the sides and resting against the fronts of the houses, with other
horizontal logs supported by the former.
On the horizontal logs were laid sacks of sand. Every pair of
vertical logs with their horizontal log formed a kind of door
with its jamb and lintel, the height being about six feet and
the width a little less than that of the street. These frames were
placed close together, so that the whole formed a tunnel, as
already mentioned, several yards long. On this simple but strong
structure were arranged sacks filled with sand in various super-
imposed rows, so that they formed a thick mattress capable of
resisting whatever shocks and explosions might result from aerial
bombs.
The site was very well chosen, as owing to the narrowness of
the street it was very unlikely that a bomb dropped from an aero-
plane would be successfully directed against so small an area, and
if it fell on the neighbouring houses their walls would protect


the shelter. It is also known that bombs launched from aeroplanes
have a horizontal component of speed of some eighty yards per
second, which is that of the plane, and therefore of the bomb which
it carries. At the beginning of the fall, the projectile?s vertical
component of speed is nil, but owing to the effect of gravity this
component rapidly increases, and thus, instant by instant, by the
union of the two speeds, the bomb describes a parabola, the apex
of which is at the point where it first left the aeroplane. If the
plane is flying low or at a medium height, the tangent of the
parabola at the point at which the projectile makes contact with
the ground is very steep, inasmuch as the vertical component has
had neither sufficient space nor time in which to increase suffi-
ciently and to counteract the horizontal component, which latter
remains almost invariable, its sole reduction resulting from fric-
tion with the air. It is seen, then, that the bomb reaches the
ground with a steep trajectory, and therefore, if it should pene-
trate into the street between the roofs of the houses there is every
probability that before hitting the ground it would bring up
against some fa9ade and explode, without making any contact
with the sacks forming the roof of the gallery of the shelter. But
let us suppose that the bomb makes a direct hit on the sacks of
sand covering the shelter. It is obvious that it would inflict
severe damage on exploding, and that the wooden frames of the
tunnel would also suffer, but the main part of the structure would
remain after the explosion and the surface of the street, though
covere'd with rubbish, would remain intact. In the case under
discussion, however, this did not happen, but both the shed and
the people who had taken refuge in it were blown up. Further-
more, there was formed in the surface of the road a great hole
which had none of the characteristics of a crater such as is pro-
duced by aerial bombs, except that, as is shown in the photograph
which appears in the lower part of page 18 of the Basque Govern-
ment brochure, Guernica , a mouth-shaped hole is depicted, within
which a great cavity appears. This cavity, which coincides with
the street sewer, suggests that a strong explosion occurred therein,
which, as has been set out before, could not have been the result
of an aerial bomb. Even supposing that this bomb had gone
through all the accumulation of obstacles previously described, it
is impossible to conceive how it could have penetrated to the
sewer, and how the detonator could have survived until that
moment to explode, without haveing previously reacted to the
innumerable blows received en route. In the photo obtained by the
Commission many of the above-mentioned traces have already
been lost, but those which still remain substantiate the facts.


In this shelter there perished forty-five persons, unhappy inhabi-
tants of the locality who little foresaw their fate. Among other
reports, the Commission was informed that various persons knew
of the existence of dynamite at that spot, and it was even stated
that a carabineer who had knowledge of the fact lost his daughter
there through inability to warn her in time, and that he went
mad as a result.
It is clear from the illustrations to this Report that the houses
of Guernica were not destroyed by explosions, but by fire; in
only a few cases, such as that of the Town Hall, the Anitua house,
and the Calzada asylum, in the outskirts of Guernica, are there
no traces of fire. These were certainly destroyed by explosion;
but nothing exists to prove that the explosions were the result of
aerial bombs.
In many of the illustrations given here it will be seen that, in the
majority of cases, the houses destroyed by fire have their electric
wires unbroken, sometimes in positions of unstable equilibrium
which the least vibration would have destroyed. In addition, the
fallen walls are shown lying on the ground with the rows of bricks
in perfect order, in the same relative position which they occupied
before falling, as if the fall had begun gradually, on the failure
of some beam or wooden support which the fire consumed
slowly, with no shock or violence. Also, wooden beams can be
seen carbonised and consumed by fire, iron beams and columns
twisted by the action of intense heat, such, for instance, as
balconies and transmission shafts in the little workshops;'stone-
work has become decomposed and can be rubbed away with the
hand; the mortar has lost its consistency and disintegrates like
sand. All this proves that it was fire which destroyed those
blocks of houses, and the walls still standing are proofs that no
aerial bombs could have fallen within that huge area of houses
destroyed by the fire.
The witnesses who at half-past seven or eight o?clock on the
evening of the 26th April left the shelters where they had
remained panic-stricken by the noise of the explosions, observed
with astonishment that the township was illuminated by a strange
light. Various houses were burning. The same spectacle was
observed by those who had gone out into the countryside and
were returning to their houses at nightfall. How many houses
were burning? The replies given by the witnesses are uncertain,
and differ one from the other. Some say that when the fire had
burnt out one quarter of the town had been consumed, others
that one sixth: one witness gives twelve houses as the highest
number. The undoubted fact is, as can be seen, that at eight


o?clock on the night of the 26th April a number of houses in
Guernica were burning; it is, however, impossible to state defin-
itely what was the number, and much less the hour at which the
fire started. Nevertheless, all witnesses are in agreement that the
houses were few in number and that the fire was not intense.
As was to be expected, the witnesses endeavoured to reach
their respective domiciles; but there fresh misfortune awaited them.
At the street corners various armed men were stationed, police
belonging to the Basque Government of the corps called ?ert-
zanas,? accompanied by guards and other militiamen. These men
forbade the inhabitants to approach their domiciles on the pretext
that they would incur danger by so doing. As their anxiety to
reach their homes was very great, the unhappy townsfolk en-
deavoured by every means possible to evade the vigilance of the
guards by creeping among the debris, and the chasms created
by the explosion of what they had thought were aerial bombs
and the explosions which were even then taking place. In
the majority of cases the houses were fortunately not burning,
but there was always the danger that the fire would spread; nor
did the armed men who were swarming in the streets and for-
bidding approach offer any guarantee of safety. The inhabitants,
therefore, collected the more valuable of their belongings, and
deposited in the street such goods and furniture as the houses
contained, in the hope of saving at least something from the
wreck. Among other statements, that made by Don Jesus Obieta
(attached hereto) is of interest. This gentleman, on arriving at
his house, noticed that in Santa Maria Street no houses towards
the north were on fire, but that in a very short time all were
burning; nor was he allowed to blow up his house with dynamite
in order to check the flames. He also saw his property sacked
by the guards. About half-past nine or ten o?clock at night they
heard news which gave them some hope. Three fire-engines with
their crews and equipment had arrived from Bilbao.
All the townsfolk hurried to help to extinguish the blaze, and
at last it was possible to couple up three hoses, which began to
function. A little later, for no known reason, the pumps ceased
to work.
It was now about eleven at night, and very soon afterwards
various official motor-cars made their appearance. In these were
certain members of the Basque Government, and in another car
three Englishmen who appeared to be newspapermen. From
that time on, the firemen ceased to work, and prevented the
townsfolk from making any use of the fire-engines. At eleven
o?clock at night the railway station and the stationmaster?s house


adjoining was sacked and burned by the Reds. This building
stood alone, as can be seen in the photograph No. 18. The Reds
also burned certain trucks which were on the sidings.
A little later one Pedro Olivares was successful in running up
a hose for the purpose of putting out the blaze in his own house,
but the firemen prevented him from working the pumps. He
even offered them 500 pesetas to do the work, but they refused
the money and pursued their obstructive tactics. The three
Englishmen then offered to take Olivares to Bilbao in their car,
as they wished him to give an account there of the burning of
Guernica. One townsman, who was watching the oncoming
flames, stoically proposed to the militiamen that they should plant
a cannon in front of his house and blow it to pieces, in order
that the gap thereby produced might check the conflagration, but
his generous offer was not accepted.
The fire continued all through the night of Monday the 26th
April, and all Tuesday and Wednesday as well. On the Wednes-
day, three days after the fire had started, certain houses, which
had not hitherto been involved, caught fire, among them being
the house of Sehor Lopez de la Calle (Plates 5 and 6), a detached
house on a corner, with two frontages and a large and beautiful
garden. It is impossible that the fire could automatically have
extended itself to this house. It can only be explained as human
handiwork. On the third day the Vasca Tavern also began to
burn, as well as the house of Sehor Ascondo, and another house
near by.
On Tuesday the 27th April the widow of a certain Sehor Goiti
was at home in her house, number 39, Asilo Calzada Street; at
that date the house had suffered no damage. She then left
Guernica, returning on Thursday the 29th, when the Nationalists
entered the town; but by that time the house had been burnt
down. She does not know how or by whom the fire was started,
but she believes that it was set on fire intentionally, as she left
it on the 27th locked and in good order.
But fires still broke out in Guernica, even after the arrival of
the Nationalists, as witnessed by the declaration of Senora Maria
de las Mercedes Alonso Arbe, owner of the house number 10, Los
Tilos Street. Until the 30th April this house had suffered no direct
damage. About half-past twelve at night the lady was informed
that the lower part of the house was ablaze, and she saw flames
proceeding from a small lower room on the left, in which was
an open window giving on the street. Some soldiers responded
to her cries for help, and with a hand-pump they knocked down
a wall and were successful in putting out this fire. Guernica had


only just been captured, and certain hostile individuals still
remained concealed in various places; these were without doubt
the incendiaries in this case. It may be noted, however, that
while previously every fire which had been started was allowed to
burn itself entirely out, after the capture by the Nationalists a fire
was hardly alight before it was extinguished.
Apart from all that has already been said, it is well to take
note of one singular fact, and that is that all the witnesses, without
exception, agree in stating that after leaving the shelters and
throughout the night of the 26th to the 27th they noticed numer-
ous explosions within the town bounds; some of these were of
great intensity, such as those which they noticed when they were
hidden in the shelters and which they had attributed to aerial
bombs. None of the witnesses even thought of suggesting that
these nocturnal explosions were the result of aerial bombs, as
the night was dark, and no aeroplanes could have ventured a
flight among the mountains at that hour with any hope of success,
nor could they have managed to drop their projectiles on any
particular objectives; such systematic destruction could only have
been wrought by dynamiters within the town, and it is significant
that these explosions continued with increasing frequency and
intensity from eleven o?clock all through the night; that is to say,
from the time that the Basque Government motor-cars reached
Guernica.
At eight o?clock on the night of the 26th April the intensive
destruction of Guernica had not yet begun. With a very slight
effort it would have been possible to check the destruction which
had started, and it would have cost little trouble to effect the
necessary repairs in respect of the damage already done. The real
cause of the destruction of Guernica was the explosions which
continued throughout the night, and the conflagration, the
extinction of which was forbidden?by police and guards?and
the extension of which was fostered by all possible means. It is
clearly shown by the photographs published in Guernica , that on
the 27th April many buildings were standing, because the photo-
graphs in question must have been taken in the daytime, that is to
say, after the happenings of the tragic night of Monday the 26th.
One of these photographs in particular merits especial mention.
It shows the destruction of the reredos of the church of San
Juan, a building standing completely apart, and surrounded by
streets. In this photograph the reredos is completely enveloped
in flames, springing from the steps of the altar with an extraordi-
nary symmetry, enveloping the whole reredos in one blaze in the
midst of which the image of the saint can be seen emerging. It will


be appreciated that the taking of such a photograph involved, in
the first place, the careful arrangement of a tripod in the most
convenient spot; on this a camera had been adjusted and had been
focussed with the greatest precision in order that no detail should
be blurred. Afterwards the light had been well calculated and
the speed of the shutter, and when everything had been placed
in position the word had been given to set fire to the petrol in
which the base of the altar had been soaked. And it had all been
so perfectly arranged that the flames had broken out at the same
time; a brilliant flame at the base where the petrol is most abun-
dant, and thinner as it ascends the reredos and the combustible
matter gradually consumes away. It had not reached to the dome,
which in this photograph is still intact, but which was burnt later
on, as can be seen in the other photo (Plate 17) taken afterwards
by the Commission.
We have photographed this same altar, or rather its charred
remains, from the same site and with the same precautions; all
we have omitted to do is to pour out and set fight to the petrol.
Obviously our photograph (No. 17) is less picturesque, but if it is
compared with that in Guernica it will be found very illuminating.
On the boarded floor of the church of San Juan the traces of
burning petrol can still be seen. The scorched edges of these
holes prove beyond doubt their origin, as do those which appear
on the floor of the stage of the cinema shown in Plate 14. There
also it is plain that the petrol was thrown about on both sides and
lighted. The projection-room has also been burnt out inside,
but outside it is intact, a fact which would indeed be strange did
one exclude the suggestion of intention. Before the projection-
room was set on fire it was looted, nothing remaining in it except
worthless effects. At the entrance to this projection-room was
seen an empty petrol receptacle of a capacity of five litres, which
was photographed and is shown in the illustration.
From all that has been previously set out it can be deduced
that on the Basque Government decreeing the evacuation of
Guernica, a conflagration broke out in the town, which was aided
and abetted in three distinct manners by the guards, the ?ert-
zahas? and the militiamen under their command, namely by
omitting to extinguish it, by forbidding its extinction, and by
aiding its extension. Neither the firemen nor the armed men who
occupied the town took any steps to put it out; the townsfolk
who by all means in their power sought to avert the catastrophe
were not permitted so to do. The firemen and their comrades
would not take any steps even when a reward was offered.
During those hours the casual spectator would only have seen


in Guernica disorder and desolation; but closer observation would
have detected careful organisation. Each explosion occurred at
the prearranged moment, each fire was set alight by the agent
previously designated and at the precise moment when those who
had planned it were at their respective posts and ran no risk. For
the others?what did it matter! They were of no importance?
as likely as not they were aged men, women and children, whose
corpses would serve admirably for the purpose of propaganda
against the Army of Liberation.
Among the ruins have been found various stabilisers belonging
to incendiary aerial bombs, and these have been used as an
argument for imputing the origin of the fire to such a cause.
But the flaw in this argument is that, at eight o?clock on the night
of 26th April, when the townsfolk left the shelters and those who
had gone into the country returned, only a few houses were
burning and the fire could have been got under control. The
fire began when the townsfolk had taken refuge in the shelters
owing to fear of the explosions, so that no one saw how it
commenced, and it has been impossible to clear up the question
of the origin of the above-mentioned stabilisers. At any rate,
they were not stamped with the German eagle, nor with the word
?Rome,? as alleged by the Red propaganda.
It is, indeed, only reasonable to suppose that those who refused
to allow the fire to be extinguished had in fact started it. Especially
when they had previously bla2oned it abroad that ?if the Fascists
capture the town from us, they will find nothing but a heap of
ashes.?
Again, a conflagration caused from the air always begins from
the top downwards, and there are none such in Guernica.
Reference need only be made to that photograph of the burning
of the reredos of the church of San Juan, and to other photo-
graphs from the same brochure, in which the fire and smoke are
shown issuing from below, and in which the traces of the smoke
appear on the lintels of the doors and windows of the lower
stories and not in those of the upper.
Something might have been urged if, as alleged by the Red
propaganda, the barracks of the militiamen, the munition fac-
tories, the Tree of Guernica and the Parliament Elouse in Guer-
nica had all been destroyed. On the contrary, however, all the
above remained untouched.
It is one proof more that the destruction was carefully premedi-
tated. Those who carried out the work were not going to destroy
their offices and their telephones, from which alike issued the orders
and the agents charged with their transmission and execution.


Guernica possessed some 300 houses; of these 71 per cent have
been completely destroyed, and 7 per cent have been badly bat-
tered about. The remaining 22 per cent are damaged, but not
to the same extent, and into these the population has crowded,
with all the inconveniences which are to be expected in such
circumstances.
The destruction of Guernica is almost exactly paralleled by that
of Irun and Eibar, but in the case of Guernica an attempt has
been made to utilise its destruction for purposes of political
propaganda, blending it with other events which happened at
the same time in other places, and confounding the whole issue
with clever and insidious distortion of the facts.
In the case of Guernica, the press and radio campaigns which
have been carried on the world over have sought to smother
under a wave of ink and slime the heroic people who are inscribing
with their blood those doctrines of normality which the rest of
the world will have to learn or perish.
This political propaganda is couched in a vein of truly apoca-
lyptic extravagance, and speaks of thousands of innocent victims
cruelly machine-gunned without warning. According to these
reports, on that Monday Guernica lay wrapped in its own
peaceful existence, far removed from even the whisper of warlike
thoughts. It was celebrating its weekly cattle market with all
the joy and merriment of a pagan festival. The churches were
filled with the usual throngs of worshippers lifting their prayers
to the Almighty and assisting at the religious ceremonies. In the
orchards and nearby fields every bucolic scene was in full swing.
And, so it is alleged, upon this Arcadian idyll there were suddenly
launched all the horrors of a ruthless warfare. In the grip of a
savage hatred and inspired by a refinement of cruelty our soldiers,
so we are given to understand, mowed down women and chil-
dren, burned and destroyed their simple homes, and in a few
hours converted into a heap of smoking ruins a country town
which so short a time before had been the abode of life and
innocent happiness.
It was said that the Tree of Guernica, symbol of all the most
ancient traditions, had been cut down. It was said that the
Parliament House, in the library and archives of which had up
to the present been preserved vast treasures of culture, had been
reduced to ruins. Nothing remained of the thousand-year-old
Tree, nothing of the Parliament House, nothing of the gardens,
nothing of the town. That ferocious squadron of aeroplanes,
borne upon the wind of implacable hatred?those hosts of a new
Attila?had blotted out this peaceful scene for ever and a day.


Senor Aguirre, who, consumed with the desire for power,
strove to wrest from Spain one of her ancient provinces; he who
rose suddenly from the shadows like some fiery Catherine-wheel
to return, like it, to the obscurity whence he came, launched to
the heavens an outraged cry: ?They have sought to wound us
in the tenderest part of our feelings as patriots, showing once
again what the Basque race has to hope for from those who do
not hesitate to destroy even the sanctuary wherein are enshrined
the centuries of our free democracy.?
And in another place he has written: ?The German planes bom-
barded the holy city of the Basques for three and a half hours,
reducing it to ashes.?
But while he was saying this, his agents, his ?ertzaha? police
and his soldiers were carrying out in Guernica his plan of destruc-
tion under cover of the night. While Aguirre was making this
statement he well knew that even after the three and a half
hours in question the damage which the town had suffered
could have been checked. But that was no part of his plan.
It took his agents three days to destroy it completely, and he
left them in peace to do it while he poured out his plaint to
the world.
We must leave this political propaganda to pursue its course.
Soon the truth will emerge, and be recognised by all honourable
men.
The Commission, after its work of investigation, and having
heard the evidence adduced, has come to the following con-
clusions:
(i) The destruction of Guernica was caused by fire.
(ii) The number of victims in Guernica on the 26th April
did not reach one hundred.
(iii) No damage was caused to the Tree of Guernica, the
Parliament House, the convents converted into military barracks
or to the arms and munitions factories.
(iv) At four o?clock on the afternoon of the 26th April the
few inhabitants who remained in Guernica observed the appear-
ance of certain aeroplanes. They thereupon took refuge in the
shelters and saw nothing of what took place in the town up to
half-past seven in the evening, at which hour they ventured forth.
(v) For three hours and a half, and throughout the following
night, the inhabitants of Guernica listened to heavy explosions
which took place within the town.
(vi) Near the network of highways to the east of Guernica
several aerial bombs fell. It appeared that the object of these
bombs was to cut the communications.


(vii) No signs are visible of the explosion of any aerial bombs
within the town.
(viii) The explosions heard within the town by the inhabitants
of Guernica were the result of dynamite detonated in the sewers
and in other parts of the town, in accordance with the Basque
Government?s prearranged plan.
(ix) At eight o?clock on the night of the 26th April, when
the townsfolk left the shelters, a certain number of houses in
Guernica began to burn. It would have been an easy matter to
have put out these fires and to repair the damage caused up to
that time. After the above-mentioned hour no aeroplanes flew
over Guernica, nor in its neighbourhood, up to the time our
soldiers entered. The destruction of Guernica, therefore, cannot be
attributed to German planes.
(x) From this hour onwards (eight o?clock in the evening of
the 26th April) the inhabitants were able to see what was taking
place in the town. The Red militiamen not only took no steps
to check the conflagration, but they prevented the townsfolk
from taking steps to that end. For three successive days these
militiamen continued to set fires alight and to help them to spread;
and some of this work was continued later, even after our troops
had entered Guernica.
(xi) The fire and the explosions caused the total destruction
of 71 per cent of the houses in Guernica; 7 per cent were damaged
to a less but nevertheless noteworthy extent, and the remaining
22 per cent were damaged slightly.
(xii) The destruction of Guernica was the climax of the
evacuation order issued by the Basque Government for the 26th
of April; this order caused the departure from the town of certain
inhabitants who had somehow received notice of it, and who
feared the manner in which the evacuation might be carried out.
(xiii) Apart from the complex political factors involved and its
use as worldwide propaganda, the burning of Guernica is similar
in its cause and effect to that of Inin, Eibar and Potes.
(xiv) The campaign of political propaganda of which Guernica
has been made the subject has no basis in fact, but is a clever
blend of unrelated happenings which in no way approximate to
reality.

REPORT OF INSPECTION
The Commission of Investigation, composed of Don Estanislao
Herran, Chairman, and Don Joaquin Garda Tuhon, Don Jose
Usera Rodriguez and Don Tomas Pereda Garcia, Members of
the Commission, met in the town of Guernica on the 9th
August 1937.
For the purpose of carrying out the duties entrusted to it, the
Commission inspected and examined the highways, streets and
squares of the above-mentioned town, as well as certain buildings
especially mentioned in the verbal declarations which had been
previously taken, and hereby records the result of its inspection
in the following observations:
In the suburb of Renteria, situated to the north-east of the
town, is a bridge over the Mundaca estuary on the highway from
Bilbao to Lequeitio. The road from Ajanguiz joins this highway
a short distance from the bridge, and, a few metres farther on,
that from Arrazua, which two roads lead more or less directly
to Marquina and Durango. The Commission observed that in
the ground close to the above-mentioned two forks, and in a
manner surrounding them, appear various holes or craters of
about seven metres in diameter and three in depth. These holes
or craters were undoubtedly caused by explosive aerial bombs.
In front of this bridge, in the street of San Juan and a few metres
beyond, still in the suburb of Renteria, the Lequeitio road shows
evident traces of having been recently repaired. From the nature
of the repairs it was clear that various deep holes had been filled
in, and that these holes had been caused by bombs. In the street
of San Juan the repair work had been done at a spot where there
was a sewer man-hole. Several conical holes or craters similar
to the above were noted in the kitchen-garden of the Convent
of La Merced in the suburb of Renteria to the north of the
Lequeitio road. The convent itself had been converted into a
barracks by the Basque militiamen, and was intact, with the
exception of a portion to the south-east, where the roof of a shed
had collapsed.
On entering the town by the above-mentioned San Juan street,
and leaving it by Don Tello Street in the direction of the Amore-
bieta-Pedernales Railway Station, the Commission reached the
dwelling-house at one time the headquarters of ?La Guerniquesa?


Sports Club, later on converted into a secondary school, and
finally used as a Communist barracks. This building has been
entirely consumed by fire and only the outer walls remain stand-
ing. On the side of the house facing the street could be noted
the marks of numerous bullets or splinters. On account of the
fire which had broken out in the interior of the building, the
passenger accommodation at the railway station presented the
same aspect of complete destruction, and on two sidings in
the rear could be seen the remains of five trucks which had
been burnt out. Next to them were two machine-shops un-
damaged by fire, but on certain lots near the station towards the
east were noted two craters caused by the explosion of aerial
bombs.
Following the railway line towards the south, the Commission
reached the Talleres de Guernica (Guernica Workshops), on the
left of and close to the line and at about three hundred metres
distant from the station. In these workshops war material had
been manufactured, and pistols in the nearby factory of Messrs.
Unceta & Co. Both buildings were undamaged, a fire which
broke out in one of the sheds of the Talleres having been immedi-
ately put out by the workmen.
Leaving these factories and proceeding westwards to Asilo
Calzada Street, the Commission visited the Old Men?s Home of
the same name and saw that the right wing of the building had
been destroyed by a heavy explosion, but that there was no sign
of fire. Behind the house number 39, situated in the same street
and belonging to a Sehora Goitia, is another house, the property
of the same owner. The two houses stand back to back, and
the interior of the second-mentioned has been burnt out. This
house adjoins, to the north, another house, the property of Don
Castor Oriarte, which was also destroyed by fire.
The Commission then left Asilo Calzada Street and went
north-eastwards to the historic Parliament House, a magnificent
stone building, standing in its own grounds and surrounded by
a substantial curved iron railing. All this property was intact,
as was also the ?shrine? and the symbolical Tree of Guernica
situated close to the west side of the building.
In Antigua Square, which is almost entirely occupied by the
Parliament House and grounds, also stands the Convent of Santa
Clara, which had been turned into a barracks by the Basque
troops. The flooring of the third and fourth stories of this
building showed signs of repairs over a surface of barely one
square metre. The Commission were told that a small fire had
broken out there, but that the building itself was unharmed. In


die garden of the Convent could be seen two holes which seemed
to have been caused by severe explosions.
Continuing on their way through the upper part of the town,
the Commission saw that, in Allende Salazar Street, and about
six metres from the extreme north-east of the town house of the
Count of Montefuerte, behind the Parish Church of Santa Maria,
a heavy explosion had caused a great hole and had cut the water-
main, the man-hole of which was close by, and had damaged
the railing and wall which ran round the building and garden.
The house, however, still retained its roof.
No damage was caused to the Parish Church of Santa Maria on
the 26th April. The Commission had evidence that the collapse
of the Mazarredo Chapel and the breakage of a quantity of glass
was due to the explosion of a Red grenade on the day the troops
of General Franco entered Guernica. The parish house adjoining
the church and completely separated from any other building
was, however, completely burned out inside. A new roof had
recently been put on.
Continuing along Allende Salazar Street, the Commission
arrived again at San Juan Street, in which are situated the houses
of Don Jose Lopez de la Calle and of Senor Ascondo, respectively.
The first-mentioned, which stands by itself, is on the corner of
Azoquecalle, and the second on that of Artecalle. Both these
houses appear to have been completely destroyed by fire, to-
gether with the Church of San Juan, which also stands by itself
in a spot where San Juan Street becomes slightly wider. From
this street the short boulevard of San Juan runs northward, about
half way along which and towards the north can be seen the effects
of another great explosion. This took place near the man-hole
of the sewer, and shattered along a length of some metres the
wall and railing of the garden belonging to Don Jose Ecenarro,
and surrounding his chalet; the tower has been forced slightly
out of the straight towards the north and has become detached
from the rest of the building.
From San Juan Street also runs San Pedro Street, which in
turn becomes the Boulevard de los Tilos, where the highway to
Bermeo passes. In the right-hand block of buildings in San
Pedro Street stands the house of Doha Maria de las Mercedes
Alonso, in which only in a room on the left of the main entrance
were encountered obvious signs of fire. A great hole was also
observed in the wall between the room and the doorway. Almost
in front of this house and to the left of the street the effects of
another explosion were noted at a point immediately adjacent to
a sewer man-hole, which had partly destroyed the wall and railing


of the garden of another hotel. In the Boulevard de los Tilos
also stands the magnificent house of the Augustine Fathers.
This building had been converted into a barracks by the Basque
militiamen, and no damage had been caused either to the building,
to the garden or to the playgrounds thereto attached.
With this survey carried out by the Commission it may be said
that they had covered the ground in the centre of the town lying
between Calles Don Tello, 8 de Enero, Barrencalle, Artecalle
and Goyencalle which parallel each other towards the north and
south and are crossed or cut in half by Calles Adolfo Uriose,
Fernando el Catolico, Industria and Loizaga, and by the squares
of La Estacion, del Ferial and Las Escuelas, The general aspect
of these streets and squares presents a dramatic picture of
desolation and ruin. With the exception of the buildings in the
square of Las Escuelas, which are badly damaged inside, all
the rest have been destroyed. It can safely be affirmed that the
greater part of this damage was caused by fire, as is shown by the
smoke-stains observable in the lintels of the doors and windows
of the lower floors, by the carbonised wooden beams, by the
window frames which have been reduced to ashes, by the walls
or remains thereof which have remained upright in a manner
which could not have occurred if any nearby explosion had
caused them to rock, by the iron beams twisted by the heat of
the fire, by the transmission machinery of the little workshops
also twisted by the same cause, and by the fallen walls.
Very few indeed are the houses destroyed by the action of
explosives. Of these few, one was that belonging to Don
Nicolas Anitua in Goyencalle, another was the Town Hall in
Azoquecalle or the adjoining square, and two more, opposite
each other in Calle Santa Maria. Between these two last-
mentioned houses there has been formed a great cavity where a
shelter had been built, and in which, as in that in Calle Asilo
Calzada, various persons are said to have met their death.
It is a remarkable fact that among the debris of the houses
destroyed by fire scarcely any remains of furniture or other
household goods are to be detected.
The effects of blasts or explosions can also be seen on the
Bilbao road, which was cut where Artecalle runs into it. They
can also be seen in the central stone ramp which runs from
the Bilbao road to Las Escuelas Square, in Calles Fernando el
Catolico, Tello Street, and Bde Enero. All these explosions took
place either at or very close to sewer man-holes.
The tavern called ?Vasca,? belonging to Don Faustino Ruiz,
on the corner of Goyencalle and Calle Adolfo Orioste, had


been destroyed by fire. This building abuts on its north side
with another which has also been burned, and on the east with
another belonging to the same owner and in course of con-
struction.
Finally, at the bottom of a little courtyard in Calle 8 de Enero,
there is situated the cinematograph ?El Liceo,? belonging to
the Count of Aranda, Here it may be observed that the floor
of the stage has been partly burnt, and in a strangely irregular
shape; also that in the projection room are palpable signs of fire
which are not observable from the outside, and that in front of
and close to the door of the said room can be seen amongst the
debris an empty petrol receptacle of five litres capacity.
With the above the present report is closed, and signed by the

Declaration by Don Pedro A. Garcia Sarahia, Bilbao,
this thirtieth day of July 1937
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was thirty-three
years of age, married, by profession Judge of the Primary
Court of Claims and Procedure, native of Enciso in the
Province of Logrono and resident in Guernica, Province of
Vizcaya, with temporary residence in Bilbao. The witness further
stated:
That on the initiation of the National Movement he was Judge
of the Primary Court of Claims and Procedure, and that he was
deprived of his office and emoluments by the Red Governor
of Biscay, whereupon he remained as a resident of Guernica.
That on the 26th April last he left Guernica with his wife and
daughter as his custom was, as he was not able to take refuge in
the shelters where his presence was greeted with manifest
hostility and by cries of: ?Fascists should stay outside as they
are only getting their deserts,? and other remarks of a similar
nature. That at about half-past two of the day in question he
set out for Ajanguiz where he stayed until six o?clock of the
following morning, and that he did not return to Guernica until
the 30th April and after the National Army had entered Navarniz.
That he was therefore not in Guernica on the afternoon of the
26th on which the bombing took place. That the aeroplanes
made their presence known about twenty minutes to four in
the afternoon, official time, and continued to do so until a quarter
to eight at intervals of not more than fifteen minutes at the out-
side. That during this time the witness and his family had taken
refuge in the ground floor of the rectory of Ajanguiz, wherefore
he is unable to- make any definite statement as to the number,
shape or distinctive markings of the machines which carried out
the bombing, nor can he say of his own knowledge whether they
dropped incendiary bombs, though he has heard it said that they
did so. That during the bombing he heard explosions of a very
different calibre from those caused by aerial bombs, and that in his
opinion these were due to munition dumps, hand grenades or
other explosive materials. That the said explosions were also felt
during the night of the 26th to the 27th April last, and that these


were quite distinct from those resulting from bombing. That
it is very strange that no military objectives were bombed, such
as barracks, the headquarters of the Basque militia, arms factories,
etc.
On being asked if he had any information as to whether the
aeroplanes had scattered hand-bills or announcements of the
bombing, the witness stated that after his return to Guernica,
between the 10th and 19th May, he heard a rumour that hand-
bills had been scattered on the morning of the 26th April, and
that the families of active Red Separationists left the town, but
that he has no information as to the basis of said rumour as on
that morning he was in Guernica and did not see any aeroplanes
over the town, although he several times heard the alarm bells.
That he does not know the origin of the hand-bills should any
such have in fact existed.
On the above being read the witness declared his agreement
therewith, and signed together with the members of the Com-
mission.

Declaration by Don Jesus Marla Obieta y Aboitia,
Guernica, this thirtieth day of July ipff
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above, that he was thirty years of age,
bachelor, municipal employee by occupation, native of and
resident in Guernica. The witness further stated:
That on the 26th April last he was in Guernica and observed
that, in the morning, at some kilometres? distance and apparently
over Mount Oiz, certain aeroplanes were flying. That though
he heard no explosion a certain alarm was manifest among the
townspeople, the bells being rung several times. That about
half-past one, after his dinner, he went for a walk of about three
kilometres from the town, returning thereto about a quarter-
past four. That a little later he noticed that an aeroplane, origin
of which he does not know, was making what appeared to be a


reconnoitring flight. That a few moments afterwards the aero-
plane dropped a small bomb, upon which the witness fled and
took refuge in the shelter called Talleres (Workshops) de
Guernica, so called because it was next to the factory where
aviation and mortar bombs were produced. That he remained in
this shelter until eight o?clock without once leaving it, and that
he heard the sound of various aeroplanes and various explosions
which differed in intensity. That at the hour above mentioned he
left the shelter, but that, as he was unable to return to his house
by the Station Road on account of various fires which had broken
out in that road, he made a detour in order to reach his house.
That he then noted that about fifty houses were on fire, or perhaps
a sixth part of the three hundred houses which in his opinion
were, approximately, destroyed in Guernica. That during this
detour he saw a bomb burning on a certain piece of ground, and
that he was informed that it was an incendiary bomb. That on
endeavouring to reach his house in Artecalle the guards known
as ?ertzafias? told him that he could not pass, but that at last
they allowed him to do so. That once in his house, he was
able to see that the house immediately next to his, on the corner
of Santa Marfa Street, was burning, but not his house nor any
other in Santa Marfa Street towards the north, which was the way
the wind was blowing. That as soon as his own house caught
fire, and in order to save the remaining houses in that street, he
asked the militiamen for dynamite to blow it up and so establish
a fire-break. This they categorically refused, and so the fire
continued burning all the following night and day without any-
one doing anything to check it, and that the street was totally
destroyed. That while the fire was raging the Red Separationists
only occupied themselves with looting, carrying off their booty
in lorries, including a portion of his stock of textile merchandise.
That the barracks and war-material factories were not bombed.
That the explosions did not cease with the departure of the aero-
planes, but that throughout the night they continued to be heard
in great number. That the witness attributes them to hand-
grenades and munitions which the Red militiamen had placed
inside the buildings. The witness further states that in a certain
unnamed shelter were found forty-five dead persons, of whom
the corpses had not all been identified, but that they appeared to
be those of villagers who had attended the market which had
taken place that day in Guernica. He also states that twenty-five
inmates of an asylum perished, and that these were identified,
but that he has no knowledge that any body of a militiaman was
discovered. That he has been informed that certain families of


Red Separationists left Guernica on the morning of the 26th,
taking with them their household goods and valuables.
On the above being read the witness declared his agreement
therewith, and signed together with the members of the Com-
mission.

Declaration of Don Julian Madariaga Miranda, Guernica,
this thirtieth day of July lyyy
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated that
his name was as given above and that he was fifty-five years of age,
married, a shopkeeper by profession, born in Foma, Province of
Biscay and resident in Guernica. The witness further stated:
That on the 26th April last, the day of the destruction of
Guernica, on account of the alarm caused by the aeroplanes and
the ringing of the bells, he sent his family out of the town, and
remained himself to look after his grocery business at number
15, San Juan Street. That about three o?clock in the afternoon he
heard and saw an aeroplane which dropped a bomb near his
house, damaging it. That, at the request of one of his sons, he
then closed his place of business and joined his family. That
on the Luno highway they threw themselves on the ground while
various other aeroplanes dropped bombs on Guernica. That he
does not know the nationality of any of the aeroplanes in ques-
tion. That about half-past seven the bombing ceased, and that
on returning to his house he noticed that another house in the
same block was on fire, and thinking that it would be possible to
isolate the fire if a gap were made in good time he made that
suggestion to the firemen, but without effect. That the house
was burnt down, together with the other seven houses in the
same block, owing to the assistance given by the wind. That
during the night, after the cessation of the bombing, further
detonations occurred in the buildings, and that the Reds made
the inhabitants bring out their belongings. That these belong-
ings were looted by the Reds, particularly the merchandise


owned by the witness. That he did not see militiamen in the
town at the time of the bombing, but that they appeared after-
wards, from which he deduces that they knew what was about to
happen. That he did not see any barracks bombarded, and that
he knows that aerial bombs were manufactured in Guernica, but
that he does not know of what type. That a certain house, that
of Don Jose Lopez de la Calle, now deceased, caught fire on the
second day, this house being a detached bungalow.
On the above being read the witness declared his agreement
therewith, and signed together with the members of the Com-
mission.

Declaration by Don Jose' Demanded Die%, Guernica, this
thirtieth day of July lyyy
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was forty-seven years
of age, married, by profession a magistrates? clerk, born in
Herrera de Ybio (Santander) and resident in Guernica. The
witness further stated:
That on the 26th April last, the day on which Guernica was
destroyed, he was in that town throughout the day. That at
five in the afternoon, on returning from a walk, the alarm signals
drove him to shelter, from which he did not emerge until eight
o?clock, at which time the bombardment ceased. That he does
not know the class or nationality of the aeroplanes which carried
out the bombing. That on leaving his shelter he observed that
a fourth part of the town was on fire, including his own house.
That this latter was burning in the upper story. That according
to a neighbour a bomb had fallen on the balcony (?mirador?) of
the third story.
That in the Police Court of which the witness is clerk it was
found necessary to seek other quarters owing to the destruction
by fire of the building in question. That the offices were trans-
ferred to a street opening into that of San Juan, the name of


which he does not remember, and that they occupied the first
floor. That on the 10th May, in a house belonging to Doha
Mercedes Alonso, the witness saw behind the door a bomb
which he supposes was of an incendiary nature, and that accord-
ing to the owner of the house the bomb in question must have
been placed there behind the front door on the 26th April as it
could not be there as the result of aerial bombing.
That the Reds made no protest against the bombing. That,
on the contrary, they accused of being ?Fascists? those who,
like Don Santos Uribe, merchant of Guernica and at present
residing in Forua, endeavoured to extinguish the blaze in his
house and in those of his neighbours.
That the wind aided the fire to travel, and that neither the
firemen nor the militiamen took any steps to put it out. That
his house was the first in the block, and that the fire spread from
his house to the others. That on the night of the 26th to the
27th, after the bombing had ceased, a succession of heavy
explosions occurred, but that he does not know whence they
proceeded unless they did so from the burning houses.
That in a certain house, that of Don Jose Lopez de la Calle,
which stood apart, fire broke out on the third day without having
spread from any other source, and before the entry of the National
troops.
On the above being read the witness declared his agreement
therewith, and signed together with the members of the Com-
mission.

Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that her name was as given above, and that she is twenty-seven
years of age, spinster, householder, born and resident in Guernica.
The witness further stated:
That on the 26th April last, in the morning, she noticed an


increased number of Red militiamen in the town, and that these
appeared to be in flight. That later on, about two in the after-
noon she saw certain aeroplanes which appeared to be recon-
noitring and which were flying over Mount Oiz. That about
five o?clock groups of aeroplanes began to arrive, of which she
counted first five and afterwards nine, some coming from the
direction of Bermeo and others from Amorebieta. That she does
not know their nationality. That she saw them drop bombs,
some of which must have been of an incendiary nature, because
on returning to Guernica from a spot where she had been, near
Luno, she saw some bombs burning on the ground and a circle
of ashes around them. That some houses were burning, and that
on account of the strong wind blowing the fire spread to others.
That no steps were taken by the militiamen or firemen to prevent
it, but that on the contrary, they employed themselves in looting.
That during the night of the 26th explosions were heard con-
tinuously in the buildings of the town, which was still in the
hands of the Red militiamen. That these latter prevented the
inhabitants from entering, but that they themselves entered and
left the houses, which they were looting. That she did not know
before it occurred that the bombing was going to take place, but
that her family had commented among themselves on the fact
that the janitor of the ?batsogui? (house) had left at six o?clock
in the morning with a little bag full of silver.

that his name was as given above and that he was forty years of
age, married, by profession an electrician, born in Zalla, Province
of Biscay, and resident in Guernica. The witness further stated:


That he is an electrician in the Talleres de Guernica (Guernica
Workshops) where aerial bombs were manufactured by the Reds.
That Don Vicente Rojo was in charge of the factory, and that as
he was of the opposite political beliefs the Reds put in Sefior
Estevez as manager to keep him under observation. That
Sehor Estevez left Guernica with the Reds and that his present
whereabouts are not known. That the witness knows that
incendiary bombs were manufactured in the above-mentioned
workshops, and that the distinctive features of the stabilisers
of these bombs were similar to those of the stabilisers found after
the bombing of Guernica which took place on the 26th April
last. That he saw some of these in nearby market-gardens, but
that he did not keep any. That on the day of the bombing he
was in the Talleres and that he took refuge in the shelter attached
to the workshops where he remained during the continuance
of the bombing, which lasted from half-past four o?clock until
eight. That he heard the rattle of a machine-gun firing from the
barracks of the Augustinians apparently at the first aeroplane.
That he then heard explosions and the sound of the engines of
various aeroplanes, and that on leaving the shelter he saw that a
part of one of the sheds of the Talleres had started to burn, but
that the fire was extinguished by the workmen. That no such
work of extinction took place in the centre of the town, where no
attempts to put out the fires were allowed. That during the
night of the day in question explosions continued among the
buildings, and that two days afterwards fire broke out in the
Vasca Tavern and in the house of Senora Goitia, a widow, both
of which buildings were apart from the seat of the conflagration.
That in various houses, among which is one on the Irua road,
are obvious signs that the fire was started at the entrances.

that his name was as given above and that he was sixty-six years of
age. Assistant Priest of the Church of Santa Marfa, born and
resident in Guernica. The witness further stated:
That he is Assistant Priest of the Church of Santa Marfa,
Guernica. That on the 26th April last he heard from his house
the ringing of the alarm bell in Guernica. That he attached no
importance to it, nor did he hear any aeroplanes. That on
previous days the alarm bells had frequently rung, but that
Guernica had never been bombed. That about half-past four in
the afternoon he heard the sound of various aeroplane engines
and of explosions, and saw several houses on fire; but that he
does not know the origin and nationality of the aeroplanes. That
the bombing lasted until half-past seven or eight o?clock at night,
and that when it was over less than a fourth part of the buildings
which were actually consumed was burning. That far from the
militiamen doing anything to extinguish the fires, the Reds
prevented any such action. That one house-owner tried to break
down his own house in order to prevent the flames from spread-
ing, but that he was not allowed to do so. That during the night
explosions continued in the same buildings of the town, and that
the fire continued through Tuesday and Wednesday. That there was
burnt even the house of Don Jose Lopez de la Calle, which suddenly
caught alight on all four sides, although it stood entirely alone.


That the witness had been unaware that a bombing was about to
take place, but that he had heard that the Reds knew that it would
take place on that day. That the nuns of were rescued
by the family of one of their number formerly known as Mar-
garita Uribe, whose family is thought to be of Separationist
tendencies, and that they might have been on the watch for
the approaching bombing, and that the nuns therefore left.

The witness further stated:
That she is the owner of the house number 10, in Tello
Street, Guernica, and that her first floor is used by the Court of
Primary Claims. That her house did not suffer any direct damage
from the bombing of the a6th April, but that on the 30th of
that month, when the National troops were already in Guernica,
at about half-past twelve at night, she was informed that the lower
story of the house was on fire. That this was seen to be burning
in a little room on the ground floor to which entrance could be
made on the left-hand side by means of a window which gave on
the street, and which would not shut, that she supposes that
inflammable material was introduced thereby. That in order to
put out the flames the soldiers were obliged to break down the
wall. That she does not know who was responsible for the fire.
That four days later, when entry was made for the purpose of
cleaning up the debris, a cylindrical object was found of twenty
centimetres in length and four in diameter, the colour of a garnet.

Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above, and that he was forty-two years
of age, married, by profession a lawyer, born in Bilbao and
resident in Guernica. The witness further stated:
That on the 26th April last he was in Guernica at the
beginning of the bombing in the afternoon. That the first
aeroplane was flying at a great height and that he could not dis-
tinguish its markings. That on seeing that it was dropping
bombs he took refuge in his father?s house, which he left about
half-past seven on being informed by the gardener that the top
story was on fire. That he can only explain this by the assump-
tion that some individual must have gone straight up the stairs
to that portion of the building and must have set it on fire, as
nothing was noticed on the roof which would make the fire
attributable to an aeroplane. That he also believes that the
burning of the cinematograph ?El Liceo,? belonging to his
father, was intentional, and that it was not caused by the aero-
planes, inasmuch as the roof was not shattered at the part where
the stage was, but that there were signs of some inflammable
liquid having been scattered about, and that in the projection-
room were traces of a fire in the interior but not on the exterior,
and that within the building at one metre from the door of the
above-mentioned projection-room there was discovered an
empty petrol receptacle.
That he does not know the origin of the aeroplanes which
carried out the bombing, but that in the town there had been
some idea that a bombing was going to take place. That he does


not know how the idea arose, but that it was held by Red
Separationists, and that all his servant girls left together with
his father?s chauffeur and the latter?s family.
That so far from endeavouring to put out the fires the Reds
put every obstacle in the way of such action. That he heard that
a machine-gun fired on the aeroplanes. That fire broke out in
various buildings a considerable time after the bombing had
ceased.

Declaration of Don ]uan Yrigoyen Guerricabeitia, Guer-

Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was fifty-three years
of age, married, by profession a librarian, born in Vergara, Pro-
vince of Guipuzcoa, and resident in Bilbao. The witness
further stated:
That on the morning of the 26th April last he saw certain
aeroplanes at a distance too far for bombs to fall on Guernica,
and that in the afternoon, as there was much alarm, he decided
to leave Guernica with his family. That he did so after the mid-
day meal, going to Aitzerrota, close to Guernica. That the
alarms were frequent, and that the public was leaving the town
in spite of the fact that it had not yet been bombed. That from
the above-mentioned spot he first saw a two-engined monoplane,
with the undercarriage retracted, of a steel-grey colour, with two
crosses on the wings. That the cross was of a dark colour. That
the aeroplane began to drop bombs on Guernica to the number
of eight or nine, and that as there was on the hillside a look-out
post which was signalling, he feared that the aeroplanes would
go into action over the spot where he was, and that he therefore
took shelter in the hamlet of Basteguieta, near Luno. That he
also observed another group of four black monoplanes, of a type


similar to that which he had on other occasions seen among the
Red aeroplanes, and that he saw that they all dropped bombs
over Guernica and machine-gunned the town. That he also heard
machine-gunning from the ground, but that he does not know
the direction whence the shots proceeded, although he supposes
that they were directed against the aeroplanes.
That he has no certain knowledge as to what forces these
aeroplanes belonged, whether Nationalist or Red, although it
seemed to him that owing to the number of militiamen and to
the fact that Guernica was a military objective, they must have
been National planes; but that this is purely a personal assump-
tion. That neither the barracks of the militiamen, the munition
factories, nor the Parliament House suffered any damage from
the bombing. That the bombing ceased about half-past seven,
and that he tried to go to his house, but was not allowed to enter.
That he learned later on from a youth that his house had caught
fire, and that about one in the morning he was informed that if
he had gone there earlier it would have been possible to have
saved his goods and chattels, as did his neighbours. Immediately
on the conclusion of the bombing the witness noticed that a great
part of the buildings of Guernica was aflame, and that according
to what he heard no attempt was made to put out the conflagra-
tion, but that the militiamen prevented any such action, and that
the firemen from Bilbao refused duty. That during the night of
the 26th the explosions did not cease, and that he knows that
several buildings were burned which did not catch fire from other
buildings, such, for instance, as the house of Don Jose Maria
Beitia, the Vasca Tavern, the house of Don Jose Lopez de la
Calle, and the nearby house of Ascondo. The Vasca Tavern
caught fire on the morning of the 27th, and the others later
on. That on the 27th he saw the militiamen looting the goods
and chattels which had been removed from various houses and
deposited in the street.
On the above being read the witness declared his agreement
therewith, and signed together with the members of the Com-
mission.

Declaration by Don Luis Domingue% Eyara, Guernica,
this eighth day of August 1957
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was twenty-nine
years of age, bachelor, by profession a bank clerk, native of
Maestu-Arraya (Alava) and resident in Guernica. The witness
further stated:
That he is accountant of the Bank of Bilbao in Guernica, in
which town he has spent a long time. That on the 26th April
he remained in his house, number 39, in Asilo Calzada Street, on
account of the very great alarm which had been caused by the
arrival of militiamen, stating that the Nationalists had taken the
hills of Inchorta, which news determined the departure of a large
portion of the inhabitants of Guernica. That as the witness had
business to attend to as accountant in the Talleres de Guernica,
he wished to go there, but he saw that at about three o?clock
in the afternoon aeroplanes began to fly over Guernica and
its environs. That as he feared that the Talleres would be
one of their objectives, he left for the outskirts of the town,
whence he noted that the aeroplanes dropped bombs upon, or,
rather, machine-gunned, the cross-roads. That one aeroplane
was attacked by a machine-gun from a position on the slopes
of Mount Aiserrota. That thereafter the witness took cover
in the Talleres shelter, and that he remained there till the cessa-
tion of the bombing, which lasted about three and a half hours.
That in his opinion the explosive bombs dropped by the aero-
planes fell outside the town. That he has no knowledge of
the origin of the fires, but that he does know that his own house
was set on fire by an incendiary bomb, which must have been
dropped by an aeroplane about a quarter of an hour before the
bombing ceased, because on leaving the shelter he saw that the
eaves of his house had begun to burn. That the first aeroplane
arrived from seawards, and the remainder from the south-east.
That the conflagration could not be extinguished on account of
the opposition thereto of the militiamen and the police, and this
was especially the case after the arrival at about eleven o?clock
at night of the so-called Basque authorities. That one of the
explosive bombs cut his water-supply and the main, and that he
knows that two days after the bombing a certain building standing
by itself, the property of Senor Lopez de Calle, also took fire.


That he supposes that the Basque authorities arrived at eleven at
night on the 26th, because he saw the official motor-cars. That
one of the party endeavoured to carry off Pedro Olivares, Jr.,
to Bilbao, in order that the latter might testify as to the destruction
of Guernica; but the latter refused to go. That the said Pedro
Olivares wished to utilise the engines of the Bilbao firemen to
extinguish the blaze in his house, and that he gave them money
for that purpose and to draw the water from the estuary, but that
he met with a blank refusal to take any steps.
On the above being read the witness declared his agreement
therewith, and signed together with the members of the Com-
mission.

Declaration by Don Luis Gome% Echevarria, Guernica,
this eighth day of August 1957
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was thirty-seven
years of age, bachelor, by occupation a baker, native of and
resident in Guernica. The witness further stated:
That on the 26th April last he was in Guernica, and that,
although he had no information, he had a presentiment that
something was about to happen. That at two in the afternoon
he left for the beach at Laida, and that, as a matter of fact, at
about four o?clock he saw that over the district towards the sea
by Elan were flying certain aeroplanes, the first group two-
engined and the second group with three engines. That their
colour was grey, but that he could not distinguish their mark-
ings. That they made various flights over Guernica, dropping
bombs, those of the three-engined ?planes being of heavy calibre.
That the first lot of bombs fell in the neighbourhood of the
station, about 500 metres from the centre of the town, and that
the largest fell towards the bridge and cross-roads known as
Renteria, where the Ajanguiz, Arrazua and Arteaga roads meet.
That he could not see whether these aeroplanes dropped incen-
diary bombs, as the centre of the town was already a furnace.


8 SVTORN DECLARATIONS
and that the greater part of the destruction, the origin of which
he does not know, was due to the fact that the people did not
make up their minds to put out the blaze. That the same thing
happened with the firemen when they arrived from Bilbao. That
during the night, in the houses which had been set on fire in
the centre of the town, explosions were heard which he imagines
were from hand-grenades. That he does not know the nationality
of the ?planes which did the bombing. That on the following
day, April 27th, he saw that a house standing by itself was on fire,
but he does not know how the fire was caused. That the bombing
lasted until seven o?clock on the evening of April 26th, at which
hour the aeroplanes went away. That the barracks of the
Augustinians, La Merced and Santa Clara, where the Reds were
quartered, were not bombed. That the same immunity preserved
the Talleres de Guernica, where the Reds were making munitions,
and the Talleres de Unceta, close to those of Guernica and to the
railway station. That no damage was done to the Parliament
House, where the Tree of Guernica is.
On the above being read the witness declared his agreement
therewith, and signed together with the members of the Com-
mission.

this eighth day of August ipff
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was forty-five years
of age, bachelor, by profession a doctor, native of Vitoria (Alava)
and resident in Guernica. The witness further stated;
That on the 26th April last he was in his house in Guernica,
or, more accurately, in his surgery, number 21, San Juan Street,
and that on hearing the noise of an aeroplane engine he retired
to the cellar, where he remained about an hour. That as soon
as he thought the bombing had ceased he started off in the
direction of his house, and that on the way he again heard the
sound of the engines and was obliged to take shelter in the


church of Santa Maria, where he remained about two hours and
a half. That he was therefore unable to see the aeroplanes which
bombed Guernica or their number or their markings. That the
bombs dropped by them, especially two which fell near the
church, caused a terrible shaking and explosion, and that on his
departure he saw their effects near the church. That he heard
other explosions at some distance, and that when the bombing
had ceased he busied himself in transporting his family to a nearby
village. That when he returned to Guernica he continued to
hear explosions after the cessation of the bombing. That fires
broke out in the buildings of Guernica, but that he does not know
the cause. That one of these fires was where he had his surgery,
and that when he went to rescue his belongings efforts were made
to prevent him so doing, on the pretext of danger. That the
building caught fire and that he noticed the flames in the eaves
of the roof. That he then went away, and that he does not know
how the fire ended. That he does not know whence came the
aeroplanes which bombed Guernica, nor the origin of the fires,
and that he bears witness that the buildings where the Reds had
their barracks remained scatheless except for some slight damage
in that of La Merced. That no damage was done to the work-
shops where the Reds manufactured munitions, nor to the
Parliament House.
On the above being read the witness declared his agree-
ment therewith, and signed together with the members of the

Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above, and that he was sixteen years
of age, bachelor, a student by occupation, and a native of and
resident in Guernica. The witness further stated:
That on the 26th April, as it was rumoured that a bombing
was going to take place, or that the National forces were about


to arrive, many townsfolk left Guernica after their midday meal.
That he himself remained in his house near the station, and that
about half-past three in the afternoon he saw an aeroplane arrive
which dropped certain bombs, and that later on he heard the
noise of the engines of a squadron. That he did not see them,
having taken shelter in a safe place in his house. That the
explosions caused by these aeroplanes were distinctly heard in
the neighbourhood of the station and outside Guernica; that one
was heard towards the edge of the town, but the majority in the
outskirts. That he does not know what type of aeroplanes
bombed Guernica. That the bombing continued until half-past
eight in the evening, up to which hour the noise of the engines
was audible. That he does not consider that the destruction of
the centre of the town was caused by the bombing, but that it
was the result of the fire, of the origin of which he is ignorant.
That heavy explosions were also heard throughout the night of
the 26th to the 27th in houses which were burnt. That the bomb-
ing caused no damage to the buildings where the Reds had their
barracks or where they were manufacturing munitions, or to the
Parliament House, or to that of an individual named Abalis, a
well-known Separationist. That the fire increased in volume
because the Reds took no trouble to extinguish it and cut the
water-supply; and that this state of affairs continued for two days.
On the above being read the witness declared his agree-
ment therewith, and signed together with the members of the
Commission.

Statement by Don Rodolfo Basane\ Isusi
In Burgos, on the Bth day of August 1937, the witness, named
as above and duly sworn to state the truth, forty-six years of age,
married, residing in Guernica, native of Orduha, Province of
Vizcaya, by profession the stationmaster of Guernica, makes the
following declaration:
That he was and is stationmaster at Guernica, and that he was
in that town on the 26th April last. That, as he feared that
on that day something was going to happen in Guernica, and


on account of his Rightist sympathies, he left the town, aban-
doning his house which is annexed to the station, and went to
Luno, a village close to Guernica, from which he could see the
station. He learned from a railway fireman named Pedro Landajo,
and from others, that at eleven o?clock on the night of that same
day a group of railway employees who belonged to the Reds
searched the station, its offices and the house of the deponent,
carrying off the official papers and a bundle which he supposes
was the cash. At that hour there was no sign of fire in the station
buildings which stand alone at least fifty feet away from any others
and his statement is confirmed by the above-mentioned railway
employees. At half-past eleven of the same night were seen
flames which began to destroy the station building. These flames
issued from the windows. The fire started in the lower part of
the building, as the roof was not burning, and the same thing
happened in the deponent?s house attached to the station. He
considers that certain railway employees of Red sympathies who
searched the station and carried off the official papers and the
cash thereafter set fire to the station building and to his house.
In addition, no attempt was made to check the flames. On the
contrary, the Red railway employees in question continued pre-
paring trains for the evacuation, and in the Red press of the day
following congratulations were extended to one of those who
organised that service, for his good work. That the order for
evacuation had undoubtedly been issued, that two trains left, one
in the early hours of the night and another at dawn; and another
at two o?clock of the following afternoon. That the Red militia-
men offered every resistance to any effort of the townsfolk to
put out or to curtail the fire. That one inhabitant made the offer
to have his house blown up to save the rest, but that they would
not consent to it. That he knows that on the 27th April houses
which had not hitherto been burning began to burn, in spite of
the fact that they stood alone. That during the night of the
26th to the 27th April many explosions were heard in Guernica.
That from half-past four on the afternoon of the 26th of April
until half-past seven he was hidden, from the moment when
he saw an aeroplane over Guernica, and that he does not know
what happened during that time, but that he heard continuous
explosions. That when he went out at nightfall various houses
were beginning to burn, but that he does not know the cause
thereof. That he saw a certain sewer split open, and also saw
much debris covering the streets. That the deaths which oc-
curred in Guernica due to the destruction of that town did not
amount to one hundred, a point on which he is able to give


evidence, because he helped to extract from the ruins of the
shelter in Santa Maria Street and of the Calzada Asylum the bodies
of those who perished therein. That the aeroplane which he saw
before he hid himself was lead-coloured and came from the north,
from the part towards the sea, but that he does not know its
point of departure. That according to what he heard a militiaman
say, they received the order to evacuate the Augustinos Barracks
on the 27th April, and that in compliance with that order the
militiamen did so evacuate it, departing in the direction of Bermeo.

Declaration by Don Domingo Hormaeche Arechederreta,
Guernica, this ninth day of August 1957
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was forty-two years
of age, married, by profession manager of the store-room of the
Talleres de Guernica (Guernica Workshops), native of Echano,
in the Province of Viscaya, and resident in Ajanguiz-Guernica.
The witness further stated;
That he was store-room manager of the Talleres de Guernica,
and that he was still in that employment, which he had held for
thirteen years. That by the official order of the Basque Govern-
ment there were constructed in said workshops from the month
of November 1936 fuses for incendiary bombs, and that trials
were made with certain of these, from which it emerged that the
body of the bomb was made in Bilbao in the Talleres Jemein,
Errasti & Cerritagoitia in Castanos Street. That he observed the
effects of the trials and that the bomb was completely fused within
five minutes, leaving a leaden stain on the ground. That on the
1 st or 2nd of May there presented themselves in the workshops
two commanders of the Condor Legion and one officer (Germans)
for the purpose of obtaining information as to the construction
of these incendiary bombs. That as soon as the witness was
convinced that they were duly authorised he showed them a
German-type bomb, with German markings and lettering, which
the manager, Senor Estevez, had brought to the workshop from


Bilbao. That the said Estevez was a Red Nationalist, and sus-
pecting the witness of Rightist tendencies, he kept him under
observation. That he also gave to certain German officers the
diagrams of the fuse which the workshop was making, and a
sheet of paper on which were noted the deliveries which had been
made of the said fuses to the Elementary School of Work in
Bilbao to the number of six or seven thousand. The witness
declared that he signed a document in which were set out the
characteristics of the fuses and the deliveries of diagrams and
documents, and that he stated to the above-mentioned officers
his opinion that the incendiary bombs dropped over Guernica
were dropped by the Reds. That he based the opinion which he
now expresses on the fact that certain stains which he actually
saw on the Renteria bridge had the same characteristics as those
which resulted from the tests carried out with incendiary bombs
by the Red Separationists in the Talleres de Guernica. That the
body of the Red incendiary bombs was made of an alloy and not
of aluminium, and that they carried inside a greyish-white powder.
That there was a difference between the German-type bomb
brought by Estevez and that which was made in the workshops,
the end of the German bomb being flat, that of the Reds having
a spherical shell. That from four to five in the afternoon of
April 26th he saw flying over Guernica an aeroplane whose
characteristics he is unable to specify, that it dropped six or seven
explosive bombs in the neighbourhood of Renteria and San Juan,
whereupon he hastened to take refuge in the shelter, from which
spot he heard explosions more or less severe according to the
distance at which they occurred, and that this continued until
eight o?clock at night. That from the shelter he was unable to
hear the noise of engines, and that on the ?All clear? being given,
he came out, and saw that in Guernica a very few houses, half
a dozen at the outside, were burning from the roofs. That he
immediately left Guernica that night and from Arrazua, five kilo-
metres from Guernica, where he took refuge, he continued to
hear explosions in the latter town.
That when he returned to Guernica the next day the town was
fully ablaze. That he knows that some houses caught fire on the
27th April and following days, although they stood apart.
That he heard, although he has no proof thereof, that the Red
militiamen would not allow the blaze to be extinguished. That
a certain Ramon Tona told him that he wished to blow up two
or three houses so as to check the fire, but that he was not allowed
to do so. That in his opinion the incendiary bombs which caused
the burning of several houses during the bombing were dropped


by Red aeroplanes, a deduction which he makes from the results
which these bombs produced, and that the explosions throughout
the night of the z6th to the 27th must have been produced by
dynamite, as the noise which they caused could be heard at a
distance of five kilometres. That as he lived a very retired life
he had no idea as to whether or not there had been any previous
warning of the bombing. That they had the German-type bomb
brought by Estevez as a model for the construction of the fuses
of incendiary bombs for the Reds. That these fuses were made
by workmen under the supervision of the son of Martin Setien,
and that the latter and the workmen had all fled.
On the above being read the witness declared his agree-
ment therewith, and signed together with the members of the
Commission.

Declaration by Don Jesus Maria Torn Recalde, Guernica,
this ninth day of August 1957
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was twenty-six
years of age, bachelor, by profession a manufacturer and lawyer,
born and resident in Guernica. The witness further stated:
That from the nth May last he has been Mayor of Guernica,
and that formerly he had attended to his business affairs. That
the Reds condemned him to death and sought to seize his person,
but that he hid himself and even adopted a disguise in order to
enter Guernica, where he found himself on the 26th April last.
That on the commencement of the bombing at about four o?clock
in the afternoon he saw an aeroplane which dropped various
bombs near the station. That after a short interval another
aeroplane arrived and dropped bombs, and that after this there
was a pause in the bombing of about twenty minutes. That later
other squadrons of aeroplanes arrived and dropped bombs which
caused heavy explosions. That after various incidents the witness
hid himself in a shop, and that at last he got away very late at
night. That he noted that the explosions continued from ten


o?clock at night onwards, but that he did not hear any between
eight o?clock and ten. That when after two days he at length
returned to Guernica, which was then occupied by the Army, he
saw that a great cavity, about eight or ten metres in length, and
about the same in width, had appeared in the highway from
Bequeitio to Bilbao, about ten metres before the Renteria bridge,
and that the Army had to board over this cavity. That there
was another cavity at the cross-roads in front of the church of
San Juan, and another of approximately the same size close to
the manhole of the sewer.
On the above being read the witness declared his agree-
ment therewith, and signed together with the members of the

Guernica, this ninth day of August 1957
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was fifty-one years
of age, bachelor, by profession an industrial engineer, native
of Irun (Guipuzcoa), and resident in Guernica. The witness
further stated:
That of the approximate 300 houses which made up Guernica
about 71 per cent are destroyed, about 7 per cent are very seriously
damaged, and the rest damaged, but not to the same extent. That
he had the honour to accompany the Commission on their tour
of inspection of the streets of the town, and that he pointed out
to them the spots where explosions had split the streets near the
sewerage, and the houses which, in spite of the fact that they
stood apart, took fire after the day of the bombing. That he
instanced the house of Senor Lopez de la Calle, the Vasca Inn, the
house of Senor Ascondo, the house and pastrycook?s shop of
Santos Uribe, the house of Don Jose Maria Beitia and various
others. That among those destroyed by bombs he instanced that
of Senor Anitua, the Town Hall, the shelter in Santa Maria Street,
and one of the wings of the hospital, known as the Calzada


Asylum. That on the 26th April the bombing started at half-
past four in the afternoon (by a clock which was fast), and that
during it there was an interruption which the witness thought
to have been about five minutes, after which it continued till
about eight at night. That on that day he noticed that of the
people who usually sought the clubs after their midday meal only
three persons put in an appearance, of whom the witness was
one. That, according to rumours, some inkling must have got
about as to what was going to happen in the way of bombing,
and that the same conditions prevailed in the cafes, where there
were no customers in spite of the fact that it was Monday,
market day. That during the night of the 26th to the 27th he
heard explosions of great intensity within the town. That there
arrived from Bilbao certain police called ?ertzanas,? together
with firemen, but that none of them did anything towards
extinguishing the fire. That during the bombing the Telephone
Exchange was burned, and that he supposes that the service was
interrupted. That the railway station was also destroyed, and
that the townsfolk were advised to leave, an announcement being
made that certain trains would leave from Los Pirineos Factory;
and that he knows that one did leave. That he does not know
what the aeroplanes were nor whence they came. That he thinks
that the fire could have been put out, as when he left at about
nine or ten at night only some twenty houses were burning in
the sector which he saw; but that notwithstanding that one
person requested that a certain house might be destroyed by
cannon-shot in order to prevent the spreading of the flames, no
attention was paid to him, although ?ertzana? guards were on
the spot. That he has to rectify his first statement, and that the
end of the bombing would be at half-past seven in the evening.
On the above being read the witness declared his agree-
ment therewith, and signed together with the members of the
Commission.

Declaration hy Don ]uan Echeandta Omaechevarrla,
Guernica, this ninth day of August 1957
Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was twenty-six
years of age, bachelor, by occupation foreman of the Talleres de
Guernica (Guernica Workshops), born and resident in Arrazua,
in the Province of Biscay. The witness further stated:
That, as stated, he is workshop foreman in the Talleres de
Guernica. That about six or seven months ago there was brought
to the factory by the Reds an incendiary bomb which appeared
to have come from bombing carried out over Bilbao. That
this bomb was shown to him together with its component
parts, and that they told him that fuses similar to that of the
bomb in question were to be manufactured in the Talleres de
Guernica. That a diagram of the fuse was made, that the neces-
sary material for construction was brought, and that many fuses
were made very similar in their mechanism to that of the afore-
mentioned bomb. That some twenty or twenty-four bombs of
this kind, made by the Reds, also arrived, and that these had
spherical ends. That he is unable to remember whether the
original bomb referred to had or had not a flat end.
That on the 26th April last he was in Guernica and observed
the alarm caused in the morning by the ringing of bells and by
the appearance of machines flying at a distance of several kilo-
metres. That early in the afternoon, on account of the presence
of a machine which dropped a few bombs, he took refuge in the
cellar next the factory, and that from there he heard various
explosions of differing intensity at about fifteen-minute intervals.
That on the approach of darkness he set off for Arrazua, where
he lives with his family, and that about eleven o?clock at night
he returned to Guernica in order to inform Don Vicente Rojo,
who was in charge of the factory, that his family was safe in the
said town. That on that night when he left and returned to
Guernica he saw that various houses were burning along the
route close to the suburb of Renteria.
That the day before, that is to say on the 25 th April, he went
to see a friend of his who was ill in hospital in Bilbao, and that
on his return in the train to Guernica he was able to overhear a
conversation carried on by his fellow-travellers, who stated that
before the week was out Guernica would be bombed. That


these fellow-travellers were unknown to him, but that they were
not residents of Guernica.
On the above being read the witness declared his agree-
ment therewith, and signed together with the members of the
Commission.

Before the Commission of Investigation there appeared the
above-mentioned witness who, having been duly sworn, stated
that his name was as given above and that he was sixty-four
years of age, bachelor, by profession a notary, born in Burgos,
Province of Burgos, and resident in Guernica. The witness
further stated:
That on the z6th April he was in Guernica, and that in the
morning he observed that alarm had been caused among the
populace by the ringing of the alarm-bells, and by aeroplanes
which appeared to be flying some distance off in the neighbour-
hood of Arbacegui and Guerricaiz, and also on account of the
passage through the town of a great number of Red troops in
flight from the direction of Lequeitio and Marquina towards
Bermeo. That while in his office, a little after three o?clock in
the afternoon, he heard the noise of a machine, and that though
he did not see it he shortly afterwards heard various explosions,
which appeared to be coming from the direction of the suburb of
Renteria. That on that account and on account of the sugges-
tions made by various persons who had taken refuge in his house,
he took shelter with them in a cellar in the garden behind his
house, and that he remained there for about three and a half
hours, the approximate time during which the bombing con-
tinued. That the explosions which occurred during that time
were of varying intensity. That one of the bombs fell three or
four metres in front of the shelter in which he was, and that he
noted that it gave forth a flame which did not expire for half an
hour, but that it did not explode. That the ashes of the above-
mentioned bomb were of an earthy consistency, rather like damp


calcium carbide, but that he did not pick any up. That he left
the shelter at about a quarter to eight, and that he saw that the
roofs of various houses scattered throughout the town were on
fire. That he could not see if the lower portions of the houses
were also burning, this inability being due to the fact that his
house is situated on the west side of the town on higher ground,
near the parish church of Santa Maria. That during the night
frequent explosions took place, but that he is not able to state
the origin. That he began to notice the nocturnal explosions at
about ten or eleven o?clock. That he was told that during the
night in question certain authorities arrived from Bilbao, but that
he does not know who they were, although the Government
Councillor, Monzon, was mentioned as one of them.

That his name is as stated, that he is thirty-four years old, a

last, and that about four o?clock in the afternoon there appeared
over Guernica a three-engined aeroplane. This was attacked by
an anti-aircraft gun, after which it dropped some seven bombs,
which fell near the Renteria bridge and the Convent of La Merced.
That at a quarter of an hour later some further ?planes appeared
the number of which he cannot, however, specify, nor their
distinguishing marks. He took shelter in the cellars of his house,
number 7, Fernando el Catolico Street, from which he did not
emerge until seven-thirty or seven-forty-five, at which time the
bombardment ceased. That he then saw that the roofs were
burning of, at most, one-fourth part of the total number of houses
which were eventually destroyed. That at approximately about


eleven o?clock on the night of that day explosions were heard in
the interior of the town. That these continued until dawn, and
that he does not know what may have been their origin.
That between ten and eleven at night firemen arrived from
Bilbao with three trucks, and that, on seeing that his house was
burning, he approached the captain of the firemen with the
request for the loan of a pump. That this was allowed on con-
dition that he ran the hose as far as his house, that the deponent
coupled up a hose in Azoquecalle, and brought it to his house,
on which it was possible to play water for only a quarter of
an hour, at the end of this time the firemen informed him that
they had received orders from higher authorities to remove the
pumps, which they proceeded to do, in spite of the fact that they
were needed for the saving of his house, which was eventually
destroyed. That he offered the firemen 500 pesetas. That it
must be recorded that there was sufficient water to enable the
three hoses which he saw to operate. That after depositing in
the street part of the furniture of his house and of his stock
of groceries, cereals and artificial manures (a considerable part
of which was stolen by the militiamen), he went about two in
the morning in company with some friends to Asilo Calzada
Street, where the Bilbao main road passes. That in that spot they
were approached by three foreigners, speaking English, who
stated that they were English newspapermen. One of these men
spoke Spanish fairly well, and inquired if they had witnessed the
bombardment, and if they belonged to the town. That one of
his friends replied in the affirmative, and that the deponent had
been in his house. That the strangers then turned to his friend
who was speaking and asked him to go to a motor-car which
was waiting some 200 metres away in the above-mentioned street.
That they went with them to the vehicle which was an official
(Government) motor, and that on inviting him to enter it they
told him that he must give an account in the Presidency of the
Basque Governmentin Bilbao of what had taken place in Guernica.
That he refused to go, stating that he had seen nothing. That
the three foreigners were about twenty-five, thirty-five and forty
years of age respectively, the two younger dressed in civilian
clothes, but that owing to the night and to his not having looked
carefully he could not say how the third was dressed, but that
he remembered that he was the one who said: ?You will have to
make a statement in Bilbao.? That two or three days later the
rumour was current that on that night the Dean of Canterbury
had been in Guernica, but that the deponent is unable to make
any statement as to that, nor does he know, therefore, whether


one of those who said that they were newspapermen was, in fact,
the Dean.
That twice on the following day, the 27th of April, the first
time at seven in the morning and the second time at about two-
thirty in the afternoon, the magistrate of Guernica told him that
he must leave for Bilbao, but without telling him why. That he
replied that he would do so when he had replaced the merchandise
which was still in the street. That, in consequence of this, as
the deponent feared that he would be arrested, he went away
that night to a hamlet, whence he returned when the National
troops entered Guernica.
As this witness gave evidence at a considerable distance from
where the remainder of the Commission happened to be, this
evidence has not been formalised, although it is deposed in this
form in Burgos, the Bth day of September 1937.

At the request of the judge of the Primary Court of Claims , I
have pleasure in forwarding to the Commission of Public Works of
the Technical Department of the State a memorandum regarding
the corpses found in the various shelters of Guernica , among them
some whose names are inscribed in the Civil Register , although
tnany of those who succumbed in the Hospital are missing. It is ,
however , possible that the chaplain of the Asylum may have a list
of these , as it appears that some twenty-eight went , though only
nine are noted.
May God guard you, etc.
