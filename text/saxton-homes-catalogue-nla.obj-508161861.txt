INTRODUCTION
T) EALISING the long felt want of an up-to-date Cottage Catalogue
fx we have pleasure in presenting this, our revised 1924 edition.
The various designs as shown have been prepared by one of
Sydney’s Leading Cottage Architects, and we feel sure will favourably
commend themselves to you.
The Large range of up-to-date designs shows buildings containing from
one room upwards.
If any deviation is required, either in the perpective view of building,
or from the ground plan, we ask clients to write, sending a rough
sketch together with full particulars as to number of rooms, size and
position, door and window openings with verandahs if any, when
estimates will be mailed promptly by return of post.
Since the publication of our previous catalogue our Cottage Department
has been considerably enlarged, with entirely new and modern machinery
installed, which enables us to cope with our steadily increasing business
in this department.
All materials used and supplied for buildings ordered we guarantee to
be the best of their respective kinds, and only first-class tradesmen are
employed in the preparing of the framing timbers, which are sawn,
cut, morticed, tenoned, marked and numbered ready for erection.
A new departure has also been made in this booklet, viz. : the alpha-
betical arrangement of plans. This has been done to avoid any mistake
in quoting numbers, which may be confused with the previous edition
of catalogue.
We feel it is quite unnecessary to include any reference to the very
many testimonials which we have received from time to time in con-
nection with homes supplied to various clients, included amongst which
are many in the various groups of Islands, including Fiji, Solomons,
New Hebrides etc.
Our enormous stocks of timbers of various kinds (imported and colonial)
stock or detail Joinery, Galvanised Iron, Glass, Paint materials —in fact
building requisites of every description, enable us to faithfully fulfil
complete orders at lowest current rates.
Our long experience in the trade is always at your service. Corres-
pondence Invited.
