Thank you Australia


FULFILMENT OF A PROMISE
1944
On 28th September, 1944, Mr. Winston Churchill, then Prime
Minister of Great Britain told the House of Commons, “The new
phase of the war against Japan will command all our resources from the
moment the German war is ended. We owe it to Australia and New
Zealand to help them remove forever the Japanese menace to their homeland,
and as they have helped us on every front in the fight against Germany
we will not be behindhand in giving them effective aid.
“We have offered the fine modern British Fleet and asked that it should
be employed in the major operations against Japan. For a year past our
modern battleships have been undergoing modification and tropicalisation to
meet wartime changes in technical apparatus. The scale of our effort will
be limited only by the available shipping.”
Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser
H.M.S. Howe was the Commander-in-
Chief’s first flagship in the Pacific War.
H. M. S. King George V bombarded the
Sakishima Gunto and the Japanese mainland.
On 17th Decemlier, 1944, less than
three months afterwards, the Royal Navy
began to implement that promise; nearly
five months before the German war had
ended. On that day, the 35,000-ton battle-
ship H.M.S. Howe sailed into Sydney
Harbour, wearing the Flag of Admiral Sir
Bruce Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of the
newly-formed British Pacific Fleet.


. . . Then came other units, including
H.M.S. King George V, Flagship of Vice-
Admiral Sir Bernard Rawlings, H.M.S.
Indomitable, Flagship of Vice-Admiral
(then Rear-Admiral) Sir Philip Vian, two
other famous carriers, H.M. Ships Illus-
trious and Victorious, a cruiser squadron
commanded by Rear-Admiral Eric Brind,
flying his Flag in H.M.S. Swiftsure, and a
large destroyer force, under the command
of Rear-Admiral John Edelsten.
On the way to Australia, most of
these ships had engaged the Japanese in a
preliminary encounter by striking at enemy-
held oil-fields in Sumatra.
A maid-of-all-work destroyer becomes a thing
of beauty in this brilliant Pacific setting.
H.M.S. Illustrious entered the Pacific after strenuous
duties, shared by “Indomitable” and “Victorious.”
See how they run. First time ashore in Australia,
and the men make haste to make the best of it.
To most of the ships’ companies
Australia was a strange place on the other
side of the world . , . land of cricketers
and kangaroos, of desert and drought, of
vast sheep farms and sunny heaches, and a
few large cities, and certainly of tough
fighting men. As they stepped ashore for
the first time, our men found a home from
home, and a welcome unequalled in any of
the world’s ports where British ships have
called. The men in the streets shook hands,
the girls smiled pleasantly. The men in the
pnhs bought beer, scarce though that
homely refreshment was. Motorists pulled
up at street corners, invited the sailors to
their homes. . . .


... To the ships came hundreds
of invitations to dances and parties, to
spend leave in Australian homes and on the
sheep stations. The sun shone, the shops
were full of good things, food was plentiful
and excellent. It was a grand place and a
grand welcome.
NEW PROBLEMS OF WAR
On shore, Monab men assembled and serviced
aircraft which air crews flew on to carriers.
While British sailors wondered at
and enjoyed this smiling land of sunshine
and comparative plenty (their two break-
fast eggs were equivalent to two months’ egg
ration at home), they also had to prepare
their ships for the new warfare. Pacific war
presented new problems to the Royal Navy,
so accustomed to operations in the narrow
waters of Europe. With Sydney the main
‘ base, would lie 4,000 miles away.
So the first aim was
to establish


An early development was the estal>-
lishinent of Mobile Operational Naval Air
Bases (Monahs), where aircraft could he
assembled, serviced and flown tothe carriers.
In Australia’s ports administration
offices were set up, stores and warehouses
opened, and, soon, ordnance and engineer-
ing shops were noisy with work for the
ships. The distractions of life ashore were
only for the men off duty or on leave. The
others worked at full stretch on guns and
torpedo Julies, engines and boilers, radar
sets and signalling apparatus, making
certain all would he in order for Britain’s
new offensive. Helping the Navy were
thousands of civilians, girl clerks and
typists in the offices, storekeepers, riveters,
welders and dockers. To cope with the
rush of work, additional dockyard installa-
tions were made. The mightiest of these was
the Captain Cook graving dock, at Garden
Island, Sydney, completed in time for
most of the major units of the Fleet to
receive attention there.
But the greatest problem of all was
how to keep the Fleet at sea for the
extended periods necessary if it was to
operate continuously against the Japanese.

bomb loads for Avenger raids against Japan.

CARAVAN AT SEA
The Fleet Train, commanded by
Rear-Admiral Douglas Fisher, provided the
answer; a gigantic sea-going caravan of
tankers and of store, repair and depot ships*
based variously at Manus in the Admiralty
Islands or in Leyte Gulf in the Philippines.
From there it was decided food, clothing,
medicine suplies, fuel, bombs, engine parts,
and that most important commodity, mail,
should he sent to the fighting units at sea
by sea. Aircraft were embarked in escort
carriers to he flown to the Fleet carriers to
replace battle losses, and attached to the
Train were hospital ships to care for the sick
and wounded. Some ships lay in the
advanced anchorages for many sweltering
weeks of tireless service for the Fleet, in
humidity, heat and slashing rain only a few
degrees from the Equator. There were no
amenities ashore. Swimming was almost
the only exercise. . . .
Oiling at sea was one of the most vital opera-
tions. Here, H.M.S. Euryalus refuels under way.

while she takes on fuel for the next strike.

lengka” chartered by the British Pacific Fleet.

ing areas; 4.5’s delivered for a carriers guns.


. . . Apart from radio and gramophone
programmes, the men provided their own
entertainment. Where was the glamour of
the Pacific, the romantic nights, the heart-
throh music of grass-skirted island beauties,
the long sunny days hy blue lagoons? No
British sailors found them in Manus, Leyte,
Guam, or Subic Bay. The names mean
memories only of steaming days and dank,
suffocating nights. But there was one
strong link with the outside world . . .
mail. As for the sailors in the front-line
ships, mail days were the week’s highlights
for the men of the Fleet Train. In Sydney
the Fleet Mail Office, staffed largely hy
Wrens, strove to give efficient service, hut
none of their efforts could have succeeded
hut for those of R.A.F. Transport Command.
British sailors will always he grateful to
them for making long, trying, and often
hazardous flights which enabled mail to he

...action stations
On 261 h March began a two months* attack, on
the Sakishima GuntO, covering tin* southern flank of the
American invasion of Okinawa. It was largely an opera-
tion for the Fleet carriers . . airfields, ports and military
installations had It) he bombed and strafed hy cannon
and rocket. Bombardment was carried out hy battle-
ships. cruisers and destroyers. Out the main offensive
burden fell on air crews and the men who serviced their
machines. But the Japanese gave punishment, 100. Our
carriers were the main «objectives of their hopeless,
but relentless, suicide plaje attacks. I hroughout the
Fleet our men were kept at action stations from dawn
to dusk, sweating, always toiling, and often very weary.
MEN WHO ATTACK
Suicide pilots death-dived to flight decks to cause fire scenes (left

Avenger crew scramble from their machine after ditching.
Their position us signalled. Immediately an aircraft of
the air sea rescue service takes off to search the area.

Given leave, many men travelled up country,
to the kindly comfort of Australian homes.
Shown the work of the sheep stations they saw
all their schoolboy geography lessons come true.
Unaccustomed to the life on the land sailors
turned horsemen to help work on the farms.
Others enjoyed the friendliness of Australian
girls and the lazy charm of sunny beaches.
Relief from the strain of
seemingly endless weeks at sea
came when ships ‘ returned to
Australia for repair. These were
the moments the sailors looked
forward to, as many Australian
hosts and hostesses knew from
letters written at sea. As the
ships sailed into Sydney, Brisbane?
Melbourne and other ports,
countless eyes searched the shore
for signs of their friends. Their
search was not in vain. The wel-
come, if anything, was warmer.
Golden sands gave the freedom to which their
naturally high spirits joyously responded.

time when they visited a Queensland fruit farm.

SUBMARINES WERE HERE
. . . Nobody knows the full story of Aus-
tralian hospitality. The work of Sydney’s
British Centre may he acceptable as sym-
bolic. There, 6,000 meals were served
daily, 1,200 beds provided each night.
Three hundred young women nightly
attended dances as hostesses; 63,000 were
on the roster for this duty. More than 4,000
voluntary workers shared the general work
of the place. Day to day hospitality was
offered in 12,500 homes, where more than
80,000 men were entertained in New South
Wales alone.
Leave in the cities meant a round of gaiety,
with lights, music, dancing and good company.
Operations in the North were not
the only activities of the Koyal Navy in the
Pacific. Truk Island was raided in June,
British submarines harried (and sank)
what shipping they could find, and midget
submarines (XE craft) penetrated harbour
defences to attack ships thought to he safe
behind the boom. The submarines’ work
was little known until the closing stages of
the war, hut the extent to which it was
appreciated in Australia was revealed when
thousands of visitors passed through some
of the boats at Melbourne and Adelaide.
This enthusiasm rivalled the welcome they
had received at Perth and Fremantle
months before, and submariners claim
that Western Australian hospitality sur-
passed even.the best efforts of other States.
With pretty faces, shapely limbs, these Tivoli
girls were topics of messdeck conversation.
Sydney appealed for £200,000 and built the
British Centre to meet the Navy’s leisure needs.

BOMBSON JAPAN
British Avengers set on fire a “Kobe”
type carrier, hit a Honshu factory area.
Fleet bombers devastated Shannoshu
shipyard at Injo Shima in the Inland Sea.
Battleships’ 14-inch guns joined the
assault, bombarded the Japanese mainland.
Stokers, Engine Room Artificers, kept the ships
going through long and tiring weeks at sea.
Week l>y week more ships came to
the Pacific, transports brought fresh drafts
to man them, until ChurchilPs “fine
modern British Meet” was ranged off the
shores of Japan for what was to have been
the softening assault before invasion. It
was a thrill to be at the enemy’s front door,
to bomb his home airfields, to shell his
home war plants and communications,
(.airier personnel seldom were at rest;
battleships and cruisers hurled broadsides
at targets on shore. Busiest of all were the
ever-watchful destroyers, alert for air, sub-
marine, or suicide boat attack, and ready
for inshore bombardment.
The strain was tremendous, particu-
larly for those who saw nothing of the
diama as they sweated below in engine and
boiler room temperatures of 130 degrees
F., and more, to give the ships power.
Behind all was the Fleet Train, always on
the move. Only the Japanese know why
the Train was not attacked. Certainly,
attack was expected, and an escort group of
destroyers, sloops, and frigates formed for
protection. By crippling only the oil tankers
Japan could have crippled the Fleet. But
they left the escort ships to keep
monotonous watch unrelieved by the thrill
of the fight.
BOILER-ROOM SCENE


SURENDER
The final chapter of the battle story
of the British Pacific Fleet was written on
15th August, 1945. There had been rumours
the enemy was about to surrender. Every-
body hoped such was the case. But nobody
relaxed on that account. And dawn found
the usual air strikes over the Japanese main-
land. The Fleet was still at action stations
at 1100 when the signal was hoisted
announcing the news Mr. Attlee, Britain’s
new Prime Minister, had given the people at
home .. . the enemy had surrendered. The
war was over. But not the task of the Fleet.
With the rest of the victorious
Powers, Australia rejoiced. The aggressor
had been broken. Australia could return to
her job of making her place high among the
nations of the world. But she rejoiced with
reservations. Still in enemy hands were
thousands of her young men. She wanted
them home.
Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser signed
the Tokio surrender terms.
General Imamura surrendered
139,000 troops in H.M.S. Glory.

Thank you
Australia
So the Fleet cut short its vic-
tory celebrations. Its new job was to occupy
Japanese territory, to liberate conquered
r lands, to free prisoners of war and in-
ternees. In Tokio, Hong Kong, Shanghai,
J and Habaul these duties were carried out;
hospital ships were despatched to bring
sick men home, aircraft carriers were fitted
to help in the task.
Now the job is completed. At times
it was tough going under difficult circum-
stances. But it was done. Some men of
the Heel, notably those who came to the
Pacific after fighting since that September
day when the German war began, have gone
home. Most of the remainder will follow.
But some will stay to take up civil life in the
land which made them welcome. In the
jumbled mass of thoughts which crowd a
man s mind in wartime, all will have one
outstanding memory, the memory of the j
hospitality and friendship they received '
when they set foot in Australia...

I am sure that everyone who has served in
the Far East will welcome this illustrated record
of the British Pacific Fleet’s part in the defeat
of Japan.
/ hope that <( Thank You Australia ff will
find its way into our homes all over the world,
and will not only help to illustrate to our families
and friends the conditions under which we fought,
but will also give them some small idea of the
overwhelming hospitality which we received from
the people of Australia.
To all who served in the British Pacific
Fleet, and to all of you in Australia who did so
'much to help us in our difficult task, I tender
\my heartfelt thanks and wish you the very best
of good luck in the future, /j
