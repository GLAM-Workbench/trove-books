PREFACE.
The special feature of this little volume is, that; by the
omission of some words which can hardly be supposed
either in spelling or meaning to offer any difficulty to
people likely to consult a dictionary, space has been
found for a considerable number of puzzling words
occurring in the scientific and other higher literature
of our time. Care, however, has been taken to omit
none of those common words whose spelling or exact
use occasions at times a momentary difficulty even
to well-educated people. A similar rule has been
observed in marking pronunciation : only such words
as may reasonably give room for doubt have been
marked. The main aim of the compilation is to give
as much useful information as possible in a limited
space, and in a handy and, it is hoped, not inelegant
form. With this view, where noun, adjective and
verb are all obviously connected in meaning, one only
has sometimes been inserted; but in explaining the
inserted word, kindred omitted words have either been
explained or a key to their meaning has been supplied.
The little volume will thus be found to contain the
meaning of very many more words than it apparently
professes to explain. 1
