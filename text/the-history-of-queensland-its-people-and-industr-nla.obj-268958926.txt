Mr. G. G. Swann, zvho has edited this volume, desires to thank the many Government
Departments and Officials, particularly the Staff of the Public Library, for their assistance in
placing at his disposal numerous works of reference; the Department of Mines and the
Editor of the■ “Mining Journal” for the use of old records and mining pictures; the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Stock and the Photographic Section for supplying many of the
splendid photographs used to illustrate this zvork; Major J. W. Wood, V.D., for the loan of
his interesting and unique collection of 1892 Flood Pictures; and Mr. Thomas Mathewson
for various early Brisbane views. Further, he zvishes to acknowledge indebtedness to the Secre-
taries of the United Graziers’ Association and the Australian Sugar Producers’ Association
for their valuable assistance in dealing with the industries which they represent.
Thanks are also due to the vast number of Subscribers who have made possible the
completion of this zvork, and by whose co-operation an historical record, that will suitably per-
petuate the wonderful achievements of the men and women who pioneered this great State
through its earliest days, has been faithfully chronicled. Within the pages of the three
volumes comprising the work is contained much that with the course of time would otherwise
have been lost to posterity, but is nozv preserved, and will serve as an example to future
generations.
Of the State’s advancement we have reason to be justly proud, and zvith the steady
influx of population her progression zvill continue on a sound and solid basis, making for in-
creased prosperity and stronger unity.

CHAPTER XXIII.
A GALAXY OF STAR MINES.
DURING nearly two decades after the discovery of
Gyrnpio the prospector was the triumphant
pioneer of wealth in Queensland in the South-
West, the Central districts, the North, and the
far North-West. Therewasp r obably nowhereelsesomany
“star” mines discovered in a similar period and nowhere
means of industrial wealth, the effect on the Colony as
a whole was unexampled, in attracting settlers and
wealth for investment, and beyond all that in focussing
the eyes of the world upon the new land. And there came
during the period of which we speak another factor in
making known a country to the world, for in 1872 cable
THE WORLD-FAMOUS GOLD MINE AT MOUNT MORGAN.
else such vast stores of mineral wealth unearthed. In some
cases the prosperity of the mining industry was not last-
ing, and the stimulus ceasing to act, more than one
township became numbered among the decadents, or per-
chance, as was the case with Gympie, received a second
impetus which caused renewed interest in the fields. It
is not difficult to cause a smouldering fire to blaze up
brightly again. No matter, however, whether the lease of
prosperity was long or short, no matter whether the
mining community was forced to take thought for other
communication was established between the United
Kingdom and Australia.
Meanwhile, in the year 1868, the mining activity
which prevailed in the Rockhampton district had been
successful, and the quest for gold found response at
Mount Wheeler, some 17 miles distant from the rising
town on the banks of the Fitzroy. These mines were
working in that spirit of hope without which the digger
could have done nothing, and there, in a claim near the
top of a spur at Mount Wheeler, a little lad was playing


with his father’s pick. He struck it into the ground,
but could not draw it forth. Stronger muscles being
called to the task, the boy’s father found that
the pick had penetrated an oblong lump of pure
gold weighing 247 oz., and valued at £I,OOO. A
rush of miners to the field followed. It is stated that
a peculiarity of the Mount Wheeler deposits was a
'mullocky leader,” as it was termed, being indeed a
decomposed lode, which the miners treated as if they
were mining for alluvial gold. As a result of the large
number of diggers who made their way to the new find
Cawarral was prosjrected, and extensive mining took
place.
In the same year that called the attention of the
mining world to the field in the Central district, the
North made claim to place among auriferous countries,
and Townsville, which had been developing quietly, was
given the first hint of its wealth-yielding hinterland.
The reward for the discovery of the Ravenswood field
was won by a party of miners, including Messrs. Jessop
and Buchanan, and thereafter from Middle Camp pros-
pectors radiated in all directions, the favourite spot
being Top Camp, where subsequently the town of
Ravenswood sprang up. Creek after creek was tested,
and mines were developed in many directions, a large
quantity of gold being won. More than that, and very
important, there were signs of reefs. Elphinstone Creek,
a year after the field was opened, gave good results to
the alluvial miner, but reefing ere long attracted atten-
tion, although for a time it looked as though the
difficulty of obtaining a battery might arrest develop-
ment. Fortunately, one who knew the field came
to the rescue, and it was to W. O. Hodgkinson the
miners of Ravenswood owed the facilities for reefing.
Mr. Hodgkinson, who began life in the Royal Navy,
found himself after many adventures interested in the
Ravenswood mines. He went to Sydney, the result
being that ere long a battery of five stamps was on the
field. I he stone from the Lady Mary mine yielded very
satisfactory results, 450 tons of stone being crushed for
1,983 oz. of gold. Other crushing plants were found
necessary, and this time there was no difficulty in
obtaining the batteries. So the mining town took form,
and a large population poured in. Later, in 1872, the
pendulum swung the other way, the riches of Charters
Towers perhaps acting adversely on the older field.
Whether that was so or not, there was a lull in mining,
and the road to Charters Towers, where it diverged
from that to Ravenswood, was far more often trodden
in 1872. Genius had not then solved the problem of
treating tailings, yet there was a wondrous vitality in
the field, for silver and copper were discovered, and
later tin, the value of the silver taken from the field
up to 1887 totalling £150,000, and the amount of tin
£9,000. The presence of different metals in the ore
really represented the difficulty, as the stone was found
in many instances impossible to work. A return of gold
won from the field up to the year 1898 shows that nearly
half a million ounces of gold had been mined. As it
was with Ravenswood, so was it also with the Etheridge
and the Woolgar fields and the Hodgkinson. Yet in
speaking of the last-named mine in the nineties, Mr.
Jack, one-time Government Geologist, attributed the
failure of the field to make good the expectations enter-
tained of it in the early days, to causes quite other and
apart from the value of the gold-bearing stone. The
disabilities of lack of carriage, cost of labour, expense
of crushing, absence of railway communication must
affect miners without capital, but they hardly give
reason, as Mr. Jack pointed out, for the desertion of a
field because the gold yield had fallen from 4 oz. per ton
of stone to H oz. Yet failure in no other part of the
world could be written against fields like the Etheridge
and Woolgar, which yielded up to the close of the
century 601,034 oz. of gold, while the total won from
the Hodgkinson up to that date from the time of its
discovery was 224,073 oz. The fields had a past; they
may have a future.
Not alone in the Ear North, or in the districts around
Rockhampton, was the miner at work, for away to the
south, almost within cry of the New South Wales border,
the early seventies found another mineral unearthed.
Tin was discovered, and Stanthorpe was born. The
mining prospector lives in the region of the unlikely and
improbable. His bold matter of fact narrations dwarf
into insignificance the wildest efforts of the writer of
fiction, and the finding of tin was no exception, for it
is stated that for fifteen years an old man named Joe
Green knew that stanniferous deposits existed, but he
could not persuade anyone to hearken to him. The find
of Joe Green was on ''Nundubbermore” Run, but to
another was given the honour of bringing into Warwick
specimens of stream tin. Belief in the discovery does
not seem to have done much for the discoverer, A. Ross,
of Paddock Swamp, who could not obtain the land he
sought to mine. Then Joe Green, quick to seize the
advantages corroboration of his story gave him, went
with other men to “Nundubbermore,” and returning
with samples of stream tin, two of the prospectors,
Jones and Greenup, succeeded in having an area of 640
acres allotted to them. That occurred in 1872, and it
was not long before the whole Colony had heard of the
find. A rush took place, and Stanthorpe sprang up on
the ' Folkestone” Run at Quartpot Creek. A drinking
vessel was lost there years previously, and there tin was
lound. It is not difficult to picture the scenes on the
roads to the mines, for many of those who betook
themselves thither were too poor to travel by rail. The
field seemed a boon to those out of luck, on whom
Fortune had been frowning, and they were as eager to


take it as those who through energy and enterprise had
learned to claim success. Many returned from Stanthorpe
wiser men and as poor as when they went, but the field,
with its dwellings of tents and shelters of branches,
prospered. Hucksters ministered to the wants of the
miners, and canvas stores sprang up in all directions.
Before many days a bi-weekly coach service was estab-
lished, Cobb & Co., as always in new country, being to
the fore. In the meantime the Government had officially
recognized the field by appointing Mr. F. T. Gregory
minei'al commissioner, and his conclusions as to the
extent of the stanniferous deposits were proved b} r
subsequent experience to have been coi'rect. The tin-
bearing country comprised, in the commissioner’s
estimation, 540 square miles, but of that only half was
rich enough to pay for working. Not quite like the
northern mining fields was Stanthorpe, the climatic
few mining ventures save that of the collier
affofd. The beauty of the environs, the magnificent
salubrity of the district, the advantages the hill country
presents to the orchardist—all these are founding a
prosperity and making full amends for the slump in
mining.
Away back in the seventies, while Maryborough like
a coquette divided her attentions between Gympie and
the sugar industry, and Bundaberg had just begun to
be, Mount Perry and its reported riches startled
the residents of Wide Bay and Burnett, whence the
tidings spread throughout the Colony and Australia,
and just as quickly were flashed along the newly-laid
cable, providing another factor in the favour which
Queersland had won with the masters of finance in
London. For the time copper was king, the price

conditions perhaps making for more camaraderie among
the diggers, as, after digging for the day had ceased, it
was the wont of the men to gather round the fire to
discuss their bad luck, impart their hopes, or voice
their grievances. There was not much difficulty in
securing tin, if luck were in, for it was discovered in
most cases just below the surface of the ground. In
three years, up to Mav, 1875, 14,164 tons of tin,
valued at £715,330, were won from the field, while an
estimate of the yield during the subsequent five years
places it at 16,000 tons, of the value of £BOO,OOO.
Thereafter the decrease in the finds became marked,
only some 6,496 tons, valued at £314.245, being
found up to 1887. The impetus of tin-mining
passed with the old romance of life on the
diggings, but the district still prospers, finding
in fruit-growing and farming that stability which
some 6,000 people on the field, and all the citizens of
the townships in the districts watered by the Mary
and the Burnett were either buying or selling shares in
companies, many of which had but a short lease of life.
Smelting works were erected with feverish haste, for
very rich copper lodes had been discovered. A token
of*the good times enjoyed by the new town was found
in the fact that £16,000 was paid in wages monthly.
The citizens of the Mount found business all that they
could desire, for money was plentiful, and things went
so well that in due course railway communication with
Bundaberg was mooted, and later became an accom-
plished fact. Then the price of copper fell. It
had gone up to £9O per ton; it sank to £3O. The boom
days were over, and men departed from the place just
as hastily as they had rushed into it. The smelting
works were deserted, and in truth Mount Perry had


fallen on evil days. There were, however, many who
retained confidence in the field, and through their
efforts and energy things subsequently brightened.
Although the prosperity has gone no one would be
so rash as to hazard the opinion that the field may not
come again. Indeed, there are grounds for believing
that rich deposits and capable development may yet
justify early hopes.
Charters Towers, which holds high place among the
gold mines of Queensland, was discovered in 1872 by
three miners, Mossman, Clarke, and Fraser, who were
digging for alluvial gold at a place 70 miles from
Ravenswood, and so named “The Seventy Mile.” Always
hoping for something better, Mossman and his mates
determined to prospect the country around some peaks
jutting out of the distance. A ride of 17 miles brought
them to the tors, or peaks, and an exploration of the base
of the highest of these showed that their hopes had
been well-founded, for there was quartz thickly veined
with gold. The amount of gold discovered justified the
reward claims which followed the reporting of the find
to Warden Charters, who was officially in charge of an
adjacent goldfield, and who after examination realized
the importance of the discovery. The goldfield was
named after the warden, ‘ Towers” being probably a
corruption of tors, or in itself a definition of the appear-
ance of the hills. In twenty-five years, subsequent to
the day when the three miners rode over to the peaks,
£15,000,000 sterling represented the value of the gold
won from the field. Success fluctuated, but the field has
never failed at any time, and the total amount of gold
produced up to the end of 1921 was 6,663,024 oz.,
amounting with other minerals to the value of nearly
£28,500,000. Charters Towers in the beginning was
worked for alluvial gold, but reefing soon asserted its
pre-eminent importance, and in that regard mining pre-
sented no great difficulties, for the stone found at the
higher levels was easily dealt with.
Within a year of the discovery a telegram appeared
in the papers of the Southern Colonies announcing a
sudden and very great development in the output of
gold, there being rumours that the gold escort had
brought down some 20,000 oz. A steamer was at once
put on the berth at Sydney for Townsville, and rein-
forced by many diggers from the Victorian fields, made
her way north, laden with 600 miners, dreaming golden
dreams, and incidentally suffering every discomfiture
through lack of accommodation. Arriving at Towns-
ville, or rather off it, for in those days steamers
anchored well out to sea, the expectant miners
made their way on foot to the Towers, a dis-
tance of some 80 to 90 miles by road. The
new arrivals suffered much cooling of their ardour
even before they left the one long street behind, for
Townsville was then in the main a one-street town,
with the exception of the pretty sea front opposite
Magnetic Island. A weary tramp for most of the gold-
seekers, along a dusty track, ill-defined, and as ill-
provided with water, brought them to the Towers,
where most of the residents seemed to be unaware that
anything very extraordinary in the way of gold-finding
had occurred. The business men doubtless benefited by
the large influx of men, as did the keepers of boarding-
houses, who were for the most part Chinese. It was
alleged at the time that the telegram which was respon-
sible for the “wild goose chase” was instigated by
someone in business on the field, and who, finding times
dull, took a villainous method of securing more custom.
Be that as it might, the usual result followed. Those
among the new arrivals who had the means to do so
returned whence they had come, reaching Townsville
on the return trip a fortnight after they had left the
sea coast. A few found work at the mills, but a very
large number were stranded, and made trouble, pro-
ceeding to extremities in their determination to wreck
the establishment of a butcher. A revolver shot was
fired, a man being wounded, and altogether things must
have been wild and lawless for a time.
The progress of Charters Towers from the inception
has been satisfactory, nor have days of depression waited
on future fortune, as has been the case in some other
of the goldfields of the Colony. With the coming of the
cyanide process and the treatment of tailings, mining
was at once given a much wider scope, while, as in the
case of Gympie, deep sinking represented a largely
increased return of gold. The area of the Charters
Towers goldfield was at first proclaimed at 1,700 square
miles, but this was subsequently reduced to 600 square
miles, as much of the surrounding country did not prove
to be auriferous.
Turning to another goldfield, we touch not only
the far northern fringe of settlement, but also* romance
and dangers only to be equalled by the adventures of the
argonauts of the Pacific Slope, the Forty-niners of
California, whose epic Bret Harte penned so vividly.
Away far north, well within the tropics, adventurous
miners in 1873 lighted on gold at the Palmer, and from
the find Cooktown sprang into being. There, on the
banks of the Endeavour River, beside the tree to which
Captain Cook moored his ship, a town was born. Settle-
ment went on rapidly, shipload after shipload of miners
landed at the historic spot, and camped on the
grassy slopes of the southern bank of the estuary,
w hile they made preparation for the journey to the
diggings, then full of dangers, for the blacks were fierce
and strong, resenting the inroad of the white man on
their territory. Many a story is told of parties of
diggers being cut off by the savage tribesmen, and, in
truth, the trip to the Palmer exacted a heavy toll from
those who pressed on to the winning of the golden


harvest. Strongly-armed and well-equipped parties
could alone hope to reach the field, and pitched battles
with the natives were not unknown. Living was
exorbitantly expensive, and the cost of all necessary
equipment for the journey and the fields proportion-
ately high. Cooktown very speedily assumed all the
importance of a busy town, a post office being established,
while hotels sprang up as though by magic. Indeed,
the Cooktown of to-day excites the surprise of visitors
at the very great number of public-houses, which seem
for the most part to exist on the memory of a prosperity
which has passed, although there is every reason to
believe that when the great potentialities of the
district in regard to agriculture are realized the
town will advance to a more stable and lasting prosperity
than that it shared with the Palmer. Meanwhile we deal
with that which was. The Palmer field had an area of
no less than 23,000 square miles. What it was in its
very richness of the alluvial deposits proved a hindrance
to reefing, but though some would not go as far as to
assert that, it cannot be doubted that the expense of
carrying on reefing operations must have militated
against full development of the field. If the railway
system in the State should ever include the linking up of
May town with the present terminus of the district line
at Laura, another test may be made. Probably Mr.
Jack was right when he said in a report on the field :
“The reefs proved rich at the surface, but want of
capital for pumping and winding machinery forced the
original holders to abandon their claims. When water
became too heavy to be coped with by windlass and
bucket the mines were thrown up.” What expenses
entailed by living and mining on the Palmer were in
the early days may be gauged by the fact, vouched for
by the old residents of the district, that flour sold at
2s. fid. per pound, while horseshoe nails were valued at
GENERAL VIEW CHILLAGOG STATE SMELTERS.
days of highest hope maj 7 be estimated from the return
in 1875 when the gold won was 250,400 oz., of which
all but 400 oz. represented alluvial mining. Huge
quantities of gold were unearthed and despatched from
Maytown, the township on the field. Later, reefing was
embarked on, and how successful the mining industry
was we can gather from the fact that gold to
the value of £5,250,000 sterling was won from
the field during some twenty years. That amount,
however, should practically be confined to a much
shorter period, previous to the days when Chinamen
were left to exploit the field, through the exodus of the
white diggers. And yet authorities on mining who
visited the field in the days of its decadence have not
hesitated to affirm the belief that deep sinking at the
Palmer, as in the case of some auriferous districts else-
where, would result in new finds of gold. Perchance the
their weight 111 gold. We have said that the cost ot
living in Cooktown was very high, but what must it
have been on the Palmer when carriage from the port
to Maytown was =£4o per ton 1 Timber was very
expensive, and of an inferior quality when obtained.
Now and then within the last decade or two efforts have
been made to interest Southern capitalists in the field,
but nothing of consequence has resulted. Yet the
Chinese seem to find reason for their stay on the field and
their work, just as they find reason for their stay and
work at Cooktown. And to the visitor the one action
is as little justified as the other.
In concluding this brief reference to mining in the
Cook district it is necessary to note that tin production
at the Annan River at one time bulked largely. All
who have visited the far northern town with its organ-
fluted cliffs guarding the mouth of the estuary, and


have looked from the highest point at Grassy Hill away
seaward to the Barrier Reef, against which the Pacific
beats in never-ending white-crested tumult; all who
know the great promise the district gives of success in
tropical agriculture will wish it well, for no one can
sojourn there without feeling full of sympathy for a
prosperity that seemed to have been arrested without a
cause, while the aspiration that the old times may
return again cannot but win warm assent.
Men have dreamt of a mountain of gold, and
romancers have pictured it, but it remained for Queens-
land to prove that such things might be. Mount Morgan
was literally golden. All that has been written in
fiction pales into insignificance before the simply-told
story of the discovery of the treasures of Mount Morgan
as given by Mr. Edwin Morgan. The thread which leads
right up to all that Mount Morgan has been and is
to-day, began to unwind at a pastoral holding taken up
by a Scotchman named Donald Gordon, and which
afterwards became “The Mount Morgan Company’s
Freehold.” It was situated in “Calliungal” Station.
Reverses caused Gordon to abandon his selection,
but meanwhile his brother, Sandy Gordon, who was
working for the Morgan brothers at the gold-
field of Mount Wheeler, seems to have had thoughts
concerning signs in the neighbourhood pointing to a
silver lode. His suggestion that there should be a
quest found approval, and on July 13, 1882, the pros-
pecting trip, big with results, began. Edwin and
Thomas Morgan, taking Sandy Gordon with them, left
Rockhampton on that day. Next day they reached the
scene of the proposed silver lode at Nine-mile Creek,
some 20 miles from Mount Morgan. No silver was
seen, but specks of gold were discovered. Then on
the 15th came a deluge of rain; Edwin Morgan said “it
might almost be described as a waterspout.” Rain
everywhere, with the ground sodden, caused the Morgans
to consider the advisableness of returning home, but the
weather, if it discouraged the quest in one way, aided
it in another, for the creeks were running bankers, and
rendered outlet difficult. A watercourse was crossed by
swimming the horses, it being then the afternoon of
Sunday, July 16. Two miles beyond the hut of a
Chinaman, Edwin Morgan and Sandy crossed the range
in an easterly direction, and there Morgan saw a number
of black boulders, and knocked pieces from them for
future test, which, indeed, was made not long after-
wards, when they reached a creek. There, was more gold
than stone, and indeed, that is proved by Sandy
Gordon’s belief that the find was native copper. Thomas
Morgan, who had remained at the camp, not feeling
well, probably as the result of the waterspout deluge,
was sceptical yet excited. On Monday and Tuesday the
quest was continued on the Mount, the prospectors, in
the words of Edwin Morgan, “finding any amount of
good stone.” Wednesday, the 19th, saw them again
prospecting, and the following day Sandy Gordon was
despatched to Mount Wheeler with specimens to he
tested by Frederick Morgan. Sandy never got there,
the attractions of a wayside public-house proved too
much for him. The 21st day of the month found them
again at Rockhampton, with as many samples of stone
as they could carry. The testing astounded them. “Just
as formerly, we discovered that each sample was literally
charged with gold.” So ran the words of one of the
discoverers of the secret of the Mount. Thereafter the
further stages in utilizing the find to the best advantage
went on rapidly, keen acumen being displayed in the
choice of advisers and partners. As much of the ground
as was possible had in the meantime been taken up, and
Mr. T. S. Hall (manager of the Q.N. Bank at Rock-
hampton), Mr. W. K. D’Arcy, and Mr. W. Pattison, be-
came partners with the three Morgan brothers and their
nephew in the great adventure. The sample of stone
sent to Gympie returned 3,700 oz. of gold to the ton.
Thereafter the history of the mine became that of
many a similar undertaking. Machinery was obtained
and men engaged. The Morgans on the one side, and
Messrs. Hall, D’Arcy, and Pattison on the other, held
the mine between them. The Morgans divided their
interest into five shares, one of which Mr. Hall pur-
chased, while Mr. Fred. Morgan bought the share of his
brother, Mr. Edwin Morgan—one-fifth of half of the
mine—for £lO,OOO, thus securing with his own
interest three-tenths of the whole of the mine, which
he sold to the three holders of the second half of the
mine, receiving for the three-tenths £60,000. Messrs.
Hall, H Arcy, and Pattison sold on the same day a one-
tenth share in the whole mine to Mr. John Ferguson
for the sum of £26,000. The latter interest was
disposed of in various portions, varying in price
from £5OO to £l,OOO. Subsequently Mr. Thomas
Morgan s interest in the mine was bought by Messrs.
Hall, D’Arcy, and Pattison for £30,000. Thereafter
the holders of the interests, as they were then, formed a
limited liability company, with a capital of £1,000,000,
in shares of £l, and registered in October, 1886. In all,
the ground held by the company totalled 730 acres,
and comprised the freehold, leasehold, and the con-
solidated claim, the lastnamed representing thirty men’s
ground. Mount Morgan gold was valued at £4 4s. per
oz. Efforts were made by the capable manager, Mr.
Wesley Hall, to win as large a percentage of gold as
was possible, the ordinary process not being
satisfactory. Through those efforts came the chlorina-
ti°n process, by which 97 per cent, of the gold
was won'. Then followed developments, and mill power,
capable of treating 240 tons of ore daily, was introduced’
with the result that £1 shares steadily increased in
value until as high as £l7 was paid in 1888.


Facts are very clear concerning the good fortune
which attended the Morgan brothers in their discovery
of the mine, and it is in that direction that the eye
naturally turns as one notes how chance in the beginning
seemed to favour the prospectors, making them veritable
wards of fortune. It is well, however, to remember that
other factors entered into the enterprise, which cannot
be justly viewed as a whole, unless we remember the
energy and the absolute secrecy which, in the pre-
liminary stages, after they had convinced themselves of
the treasure they had lighted upon, ruled all the
operations in development. So successful were the
Morgans in keeping secret the wealth of the mine that
even the men who worked for them never suspected the
value of the ore, or of the resulting amalgam, and the
owners of the mine were many times dubbed fools,
indeed, as Mr. J. J. Knight, when writing on the
experience of mining on the Etheridge field, the country
owed the discovery of Croydon. To them the reward
of £l,OOO was jjaid, and from one of them (Mr. Brown)
came a very graphic narrative of the discovery and the
stages of hope blossoming into knowledge which crowned
success. How much Mr. Brown’s thought that the
country looked as though it were gold-bearing moved
him in taking it up for cattle, which he had purchased
in 1882, no one can say, but that he was subconsciously
affected, by the signs of quartz he saw, subsequent events
seemed to show, all the more as he did not appear to
have changed his opinion when an old Etheridge miner
who was with him, settled the subject to his own satis-
faction by pointing out “that all the country in the
neighbourhood had been prospected years ago by
Etheridge miners.” Later two men who had been
diggers, when employed in sinking a well at the station,

subject, says: “Even when they were getting gold by
the bucketful, men who were regarded as experts would
visit them, stay for days, examine the stone they were
putting through, and being told that they were working
to get to a copper lode, went away firmly convinced that
the three Morgans were not in their right senses.”
Later, the search for copper became a reality. Mean-
time it may be mentioned that during eighteen years,
subsequent to the formation of the company in 1886,
the gold won represented a value of £11,120,860 sterling,
while the dividends amounted to £6,379,166.
In October, 1885, just at the time the secret of
Mount Morgan was being given to the world, gold was
reported to Warden Samwell as having been discovered
at Croydon, then a pastoral station in the Gulf country.
To Mr. William Chalmers Brown, the owner of the
station, and the Aldridge brothers, who had gained
found the colour of gold. Nothing resulted, but the find
brought to memory the fact that Mr. Brown had seen
quartz reefs innumerable in the ranges, but had never
lighted on gold, though he had often broken the stone.
Then came James and Walter Aldridge in 1883, who
discovered a leader of quartz-bearing gold while they
were engaged in ring-barking trees in the horse paddock.
Meanwhile miners moving about, according to their
wont, had been walking or riding over the reef destined
to be known as the “Golden Gate” of Croydon, which
then was visible on a sandy flat surface for a distance
of 300 yards. At this time James and Walter Aldridge,
having made a good cheque, went south for a trip, and
the latter, returning in 1885, was accompanied by his
brother Dick, an old fossicker on Copperfield. The
belief of Mr. Brown that Croydon was gold-bearing had
been strengthened by a visit he paid to Cloncurry, the


resemblance of that country to his station making him
resolve that he would “have a try to find gold.” That
resolve he carried into practice, despite the laughter of
his Normanton friends, to whom he made known Ins
intentions, laughter as ill-justified as the arguments of
the miner who based conviction that there was no gold
in the locality because.‘‘it had been tried.” The deter-
mination to engage the Aldridge brothers wholly in
prospecting work was coincidental with the discovery
by them of gold-bearing quartz at the point where
James and Walter Aldridge had previously found a
leader, and thereafter events moved rapidly, prospecting
work by Brown and the Aldridges being carried on when
all the others on the station were engaged in mustering,
and the prospecting resulted in the finding of no fewer
than twenty payable lines of reef. So the work went
on, until the risk of discovery compelled the reporting
of the new field. Croydon did not follow the course
experience shows to be that usually attendant on the
development of a goldfield, for during the first year
after the proclamation of the field only 2,145 oz. of
gold were obtained. There were other mining localities
where facilities for extracting the precious metal were
abundant, and thus enterprise was handicapped by the
absence of mills, necessitating recourse on the one hand
to dollying, or on the other to the despatch of the store
to Georgetown, distant 100 miles, where the quartz
could be crushed. Again, the place was inaccessible,
entailing a long and expensive coastal voyage. Yet the
stone obtained on the surface or near it was very rich,
the average yield being 4 oz. 12 dwt. 8 grs, of gold to
the ton. The first claim worked was the Lady Mary
Award, on the reef of that name, which with the
Iguana and True Blue were the first gold-bearing reefs
discovered. In December, 1886, crushing machinery
arrived on the field, and the batteries of the Pioneer
and Croydon Quartz Companies began to work. A year
later, in 1887, there were 55 head of stampers on the
field, and those had increased in number to 239 stampers
eleven years subsequently. Population flowed in as
though in response to the summoning clang of the
batteries, and in 1887 totalled 6,000. The opening of
the railway to Croydon in 1891 gave a great impetus
to mining on the field, as was evidenced by the estab-
lishment of four cyanide works to treat the tailings from
the batteries, and the number increased later. Croydon,
like other fields, experienced its lean years, times of
depression, but the total amount of gold won up to
December, 1898, was 760,690 oz., and proved how just
was the belief of its chief discoverer, Mr. Brown, in the
auriferous wealth of the country over which he had
mustered his cattle.
It may be averred without fear of contradiction
that the brief outline we have given of some of the
mines in Queensland bears witness to a mineral wealth
and development, equalled, perchance, in extent, but
never elsewhere exceeded in the sustained yield and the
general effect on the industrial advancement of a Colony.
And it must be remembered that mining was but one ol
the many factors in jrrogress and national betterment,
for while we have seen how one field after
another yielded a golden harvest, it must be remem-
bered that in other phases there was great development.
Sugar-growing was proving that even the threatened
taboo on kanaka labour could not stifle tropical agri-
culture on the rich coast-lands, while the coming of the
meat works was changing the outlook of the pastoralist
and giving him a market other than Australia, so stable
and so sure that it was destined to affect the price of
meat throughout the Island Continent, making the days
when beef sold at Id. and 2d. per lb. distant and unreal.
The selector had come into- his own during the period
we have traversed dealing with mining. Manu-
facturing industries, if they were expanding slowly,
were feeling the impetus of the movement onward
of all phases of national life. Tire relation of
mining as we have had it in Queensland to
evolutionary progress is not far to seek, and may
at once be realized by considering the outcome
of enterprise in the various districts touched by the
pick and shovel, the washing-dish and the cradle of the
digger. Mining converted a station on the borders of
New South Wales into a health resort and sanatorium ;
it created a prosperous town and made known the
capabilities of the district for farming and fruit-
growing. It gave an impetus in turn to other
parts of the country far remote from the scene
of the southern discovery, and it stimulated pro-
duction and expanded trade in all directions. To ask
what the mining industry has done for the Central
district is to court the rejoinder that it caused Rock-
hampton to exist, and in a real sense promoted the
district from purely pastoral relations to a higher plane
of agriculture and manufacture. Mining made a port of
the Fitzroy. It brought into- being the prosperous towns
of Mount Morgan and Clermont, and it gave a reason for
railway extension not to be denied, thereby promoting
settlement in the best, most wealth-producing, and per-
manent form. Further north, as our thoughts travel up
the coast, it is not difficult to see that the mines made
Townsville, and we have only to compare Bowen, with
all its natural advantages as a port, and its picturesque
surroundings, yet in the days of which we write, possess-
ing only one industry, stockraising, to see that it was
Charters Towers which made the city on the bank of
Ross Creek, gave it a railway and linked it with its
hinterland far more speedily than would otherwise have
been possible. Indeed, it is questionable whether the


agricultural prosperity which has given wings to
progress at the Burdekin Delta and founded in Ayr a
centre of population all its own would have taken place
had not mining touched Townsville with its magic
wand. As it was with Charters Towers and its port, a
transfusion of wealth and trade flowing from one to the
other, so was it with the Palmer and Cooktown. The
port was the handmaiden of the goldfield. To gold-
digging away back in the seventies Cooktown owes its
railway system, its fisheries in the sunlit waters
laving the Barrier Reef, its quest for pearl-shell,
or that luxury of the Celestial, beche-de-mer. The
Annan tin mines, which were and may be again, all owe
their existence to the Palmer field. Croydon, as we
think of it as it was before the hand of the miner touched
with the coming of gold there was a stupendous change.
Nothing else in the world could have made a town at
Croydon save gold, but with the stripping of the
covering under which Nature hides her treasuie, hands
were stretched out on either side, to Norman ton in the
north and to Townsville in the south-east. So was it
with Cloncurry, and later with llerberton.
If it be true that railways always follow settlement,
what can we say of mining save that it compels railway
communication. The map of Queensland and the blank
spaces that have been filled through the personal efforts
of the miner during the first forty years of its life as a
Colony, are answer. The railways that have been built
because of mining and its needs, the trade that has fol-
lowed mining and has been fostered by it, speak with an
RAVENSWOOD IN 1873.
it, tells the same tale. Far away on the confines of
beyond it gave no token save the tale of musterings,
punctuated, it may be, by dry season or wet. And then
eloquence that silences all argument. Queensland is for-
tunate indeed in having so many eggs in her industrial
basket, thrice lucky is she in that one of them is golden.
CHAPTER XXIV.
DAWN OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
Following the Macalister Administration in 1876
the Thorn Ministry entered into office; nobody
in those days seemed quite to know why, for the
Administration of which Mr. George Thorn was
Premier jiroved neither capable nor strong, and by most
students of Queensland Parliamentary history it was the
very minor comedy preceding the great political drama
to which it gave place. Yet the same Ministry is
worthy of note, if not for what it did, still for that
which rose from it, for by the turning of the sandglass
the Douglas Administration took form, and in it was
found Mr. S. W. Griffith, while Mr. Thomas Mcllwraith
was leader of the Opposition, and thenceforth during
nearly twenty years the two great party leaders
were to be pitted against each other. One’s thoughts
irresistibly turn to political Titans in a field
greater, with a struggle more intense, where Gladstone
and Disraeli were matched one against the other, while,


strange to say, there was the same uncertainty in the
case of the Parliamentary combatants at Brisbane as
at Westminster as to the party each would espouse.
The Ministry led by Mr. John Douglas, if over-
shadowed by subsequent ©vents of masterful interest, can
by no means be bracketed with the Government of which
it was an offshoot. Unlike the Thorn Government, it
was strong, and is noteworthy as the first Administra-
tion in the Colony to apprehend the great fact that if
there were to be progress there must be attention to the
main issues. Political issues in Queensland were rising
out of the parochial.
In the Douglas Ministry, for the first time, an
effort was made to take a comprehensive view of
railway extension, for we find a programme entailing
an expenditure of £720,000 was tabled, that sum to
be expended on the following railway lines:—Warwick
to Stanthorpe, £150,000; Maryborough to Gympie,
£150,000; Bundaberg towards Mount Perry, £100,000;
Comet River (Central Railway) to Emerald Downs,
£100,000; Townsville (Northern Railway) to Charters
Towers, £100,000; bridge across the Burdekin River
for foregoing line, £100,000; extension surveys,
£20,000. And the principle of a just allotment of the
responsibility for railway construction loans was recog-
nized, thus paving the way for a realization of the
theory that the benefited area should bear the weight
of the liability. In order to facilitate the application
of the system a reserve of land was provided in each
railway district, and all moneys from the sale of areas
of land in the reserves were by the Bill to be devoted
to payment of the railway loan as far as it had relation
to each district line. There was further provision that
the land sales should be so ordered as to derive benefit
from the increased value of real ©state brought about
by the building of the lines. So far, it will be seen
that the members of the Ministry were undoubtedly men
of affairs. The scheme was coherent and practical.
That the new system might have a fair trial and to
provide funds necessary before the railways could reach
a payable point, or the railway lands provide funds in
repayment of the principal, the railway loan was
(increased beyond the sum of £720,000, the cost of
building the various lines, to £1,322,000. What was
hinted at in the railway measure was emphasized boldly
in the Financial Districts Bill, which was a practical
contribution to decentralization of Government, and
went indeed further, giving reason for the cry for separa-
tion of the northern portion of the Colony from Southern
Queensland, or, rather, for the formation of three autono-
mous territories. To the principle of the Bill there
could be no objection, for it aimed at the expenditure
of public money in each division or district in proportion
to the revenue contributed severally, after deductions
had been made towards the expense of the Central
Government. In the measure there was also amplifica-
tion of the principle of local responsibility set forth in
the railway policy, for it was proposed to allot in
proper proportion a share of the weight of the public
debt of the Colony, which the last railway loan had
increased to some £9,000,000. The districts were
satisfied with the proposals for financial decentralization,
and there appeared to be good hope that the measure
would pass through the House, when five or six mal-
contents on the Ministerial benches raised the altogether
irrelevant point that Customs and excise, which had
been defined as local revenue, could not be so classified.
The sufficient answer of those who supDported the Bill
was that in order to ascertain with accuracy the revenue
of the thinly-populated and newly-instituted districts
in the north, it was necessary to deal with Customs and
excise as though the revenue from these sources was
local, for it was the chief factor in the public income
there, and would be for some time. Further, in defence
of the measure it was said, one must allow with great
truth, that the system would prove a guide in framing
the Estimates and also in the granting of Supply.
\gain, there was cogency in the argument of the
supporters of the measure that it would serve a good
purpose in dispelling the impression that existed con-
cerning an unjust disbursement of public money among
the several districts, an impression that resulted often-
times in a general scramble on the part of the
constituencies and their representatives alike. It seems
peculiarly unfortunate that reasoning, eminently sound
and practical, should be defeated by an argument wholly
fallacious, for obviously the whole force of the conten-
tion that Customs and excise could not be deemed local
revenue was based on those terms in one relation, while
the plea that it was necessary to class them as local
revenue found its force in a wholly different relation.
Did the Opposition from its own side of the House sap
the energy of the Ministry in proceeding with the good
work ? It is difficult indeed to say. We can only
judge by results and form our own conclusions on tlie
failure of the Government to re-introduce the thougbt-
child of a bygone Ministry, which lay to the hand of the
Premier, for it provided for the carrying out of public
works by a local and elective governing authority.
The political scene was changed; the Opposition
came into power under the leadership of Mr. Thomas
Mcllwraith, while Mr. Griffith led the forces against
the Government. Undoubtedly during the year 1880
and 1881 more political history was made than at any
other time during the life of the Colony. To very many
of the present citizens of Queensland the words, steel-
rails contract, convey no meaning; but for those whose
memories include the eighties in their retrospect the
phrase records a political excitement never previously
equalled, even when separation from New South Wales


was the question at issue. For in. truth the people of
the Colony were divided into two camps. Other
questions of great moment were dealt with by Parlia-
ment in the years referred to, for there came up for the
keenest discussion the mail contract with the British
India Steam Navigation and the Railway
Companies Preliminary Bill, better known as the great
transcontinental railway scheme.
Meanwhile, on July 6, 1860, when Parliament
met, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Griffith, pre-
sented a petition from Mr. Hemmant, a well-known
citizen and respected business man of Brisbane,
who was then in London. The purport of the petition
was the allegation that the Premier, Mr. Mcllwraith,
and the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Arthur Palmer, had
carried out the contract for steel rails with Messrs.
Mcllwraith, McEachern, & Co. under circumstances
disadvantageous to the Colony. As a result of the
London, had signed the contract with the British India
Company conditionally on the subsequent ratification of
the agreement by Parliament. The reasons he had in
desiring the contract, set forth by Mr. Mcllwraith when
moving that the arrangement should be confirmed, were
that emigrants would be brought to Queensland for £l6,
and that the new service would counteract the loss of
direct trade to Queensland then being suffered, while
it would assist a frozen-meat trade to the immense
advantage of the whole Colony, and create an important
coal-mining industry in West Moreton. In referring
to the subsidy—£ss,ooo per annum, with the remission
of light dues —the Premier acknowledged it would be
costly, but held it would be preferable to renewing the
branch service via Torres Strait at £30,000 yearly, a
sum too large for a mere branch line. The motion of
the Premier was met by an amendment moved by Mr.
Douglas, providing that the contract with the British
GOLD ESCORT LEAVING GEORGETOWN.
petition, and in the course of the subsequent dispute on
the subject, Mr. Griffith moved that a Royal Com-
mission should be appointed by the House, with power
to take evidence in the Colony and in England. Mr.
Macrcssan, who was then Minister for Works, moved
as an amendment that a Special Committee be con-
stituted, composed of four members of the Ministry and
three of the Opposition. The amendment was carried,
the voting being 25 to 20. Matters touching another
phase of the attitude of the leaders of the Administra-
tion to contracts were also moving rapidly, for at that
juncture Mr. Miles challenged the legality of the
Premier and the Colonial Secretary, Messrs. Mcllwraith
and Palmer, sitting in Parliament while they were
registered shareholders in vessels under contract to the
Australian Government for the conveyance of cargo, the
penalty for a proven breach of this law being £SOO per
day. It transpired that Mr. Mcllwraith, when in
India Company should not be ratified by the House
until provision, through a Bill, had been made to.give
effect to the contract by the appropriation of sums
covenanted to be paid and dues covenanted to be
remitted. Mr. Douglas’ amendment was defeated by
25 votes to 14, and the House adjourned to permit
consideration of amendments in the contract by the
Premier and the Leader of the Opposition. Outside of
the House the contract was very unpopular, and resolu-
tions in condemnation of it were adopted at a largely
attended public meeting held in the Town Hall, Bris-
bane ; like antagonism was voiced at an open-air meeting
of the citizens of the capital, at which 4,000 people were
present.
Opposition members in the Assembly reflected the
tenor of public opinion, and the mail contract was
vigorously opposed, there being persistent recourse to
“stone-walling,” despite the fact that certain suggestions


made by Mr. Griffith were believed to give promise
of a future understanding. Thereafter there was a
speeding-up of the subject in a statement which
appeared in the newspapers of Rockhampton to the effect
that the Government had ratified the contract with the
British India Company, depending on the written pro-
mise of thirty-one members that they would vote for it,
to hold them scathless. The announcement was probably
inspired, preparing the country for a statement made
by the Premier in the House a few days subsequently,
on September 7. Mr. Mcllwraith intimated that the
British India Company had been informed by telegram
that the Government would accept the contract
under certain modifications, the chief being that
it would be ratified, unless it were disapproved by a
resolution of the Legislative Assembly, before October
6, 1880.
Then came a pause in the action of Parliament on
the subject, for the House adjourned in order to enable
members to be present at the opening of the railway to
Roma. In the meantime, however, things were moving
rapidly in another direction, for Mr. Miles had taken
legal action in support of his contention that Messrs.
Mcllwraith and Palmer could not legally sit in Parlia-
ment by reason of the fact that they were shareholders
in a company under contract to the Government for the
conveyance of cargo. The Supreme Court, where the
issue on the point of law was brought for trial, was
called upon to decide whether the heavy penalty of £SOO
was to be imposed against Mr. Mcllwraith, who was
chosen as the defendant in the action, for every day he
had sat in Parliament since the contract with the
British India Company had been arranged. During
the absence of the Ministry at the inauguration of the
Roma railway extension the Court gave its decision,
the points at issue being dealt with in three questions:
(1) Does a contractor with a Government who is only
such, as a trustee, come within the meaning of the
6th and 7th sections of the Constitution Act of 1867 ?
(2) Is the avoidance by the Assembly a condition pre-
cedent to the liability of the penalty? (3) Ought the
plaintiff to have charged the defendant with knowledge
of the contract at the time he sat and voted as a mem-
ber; has he done so? The finding of the Court was in
the affirmative in regard to the first point, in the nega-
tive concerning the second, while in reply to the third
the decision of the Judges, all of whom were on the
Bench, was that the plaintiff, Mr. Miles, did charge
the defendant with knowledge. In the course of his
judgment the Chief Justice found that the fact that a
member, who was a contractor, thereby was disqualified
from serving in Parliament, the avoidance of the seat
by the Assembly forming no part of the disqualification
which was formal. The point raised by the defence,
that the plaintiff did not authorize, but expressly
forbade the making of the contract, was found not to
be affected by the demurrer, and was a question of
evidence to be decided by a jury, did the case proceed
further. It was held by the Court that a condition of
liability for the penalty on the part of a member was
that he must be a contractor knowingly, and Mr. Justice
Harding found “that should it turn out that the
authority of the agent, under whom the contract was
entered into, was general, and not special, as charged,
and that the defendant did not know the con-
tract had been entered into at the time lie sat and
voted, he would not have rendered himself liable to
the penalty.”
Meanwhile the much-vexed question of Mr. Hem-
rnant’s petition regarding the steel rails contract had
been under the consideration of the Select Committee
appointed. The members of the Committee differed in
their conclusions, Messrs. Griffith, Dickson and McLean
taking exception to the finding of the other four mem-
bers. The report was as follows: “That in the opinion
of your Committee l there are many matters in connection
with the enquiry, so far as the rail and freight con-
tracts are concerned, which have not been satisfactorily
explained, and they recommend your honourable House
to take steps for further investigating these matters as
may to them seem best.” In regard to contracts for
railway material, it was recommended that in future no
contracts should be made, subject to ratification in Eng-
ird, save in the case where the ratification was by tele-
gram. A debate ensued, the outcome being the appoint-
ment ot Mr. George King as the representative of
Queensland on the Royal Commission appointed to take
evidence in England. Both the Premier and the
Leader of the Opposition went to England in
connection with the enquiry, and those who have
a recollection of events in the eighties will remem-
ber how clearly cut and decided was opinion on
the engrossing subject, termed “a scandal” or “a
persecution,” as feelings seethed on one side or the
other. Neither Mr. Mcllwraith nor Mr. Griffith had
cause to feel disappointed at the lack of approval their
conduct evoked, for on their return to the Colony both
were greeted with great enthusiasm. Then came the
consideration of the House on the finding of the Royal
Commission, widespread publicity being assured for the
report through the Clerk of the House reading it in
extenso, and thus providing for its appearance in
“Hansard,” whence it found its way to the Press.
As a result of his views on the report, the Leader
of the Opposition moved an amendment on the Address-
in-reply, tor the question had come up during the first
days of a new session in July, 1881. The amendment
was as follows: “That in making these contracts the


interests of the Colony had been subordinated to the
interests of private persons.” Mr. Griffith did not
deny the integrity of the Commission, but its com-
petency, and somewhat significantly, in view of all the
facts, expressed the hope that “the matter should,
by the decision the House would come to, whatever
it might be, end the matter once and for all.” What
were considered at the time to be effective replies
to the Leader of the Opposition were made by Messrs.
Macrossan, Dickson, and Pope Cooper, the firstnamed
being then Minister for Works, while the last was
Attorney-General. Later Mr. A. Archer moved an
amendment which countered that of Mr. Griffith, and
was to the following effect:
“That whilst deeming it in-
advisable to express opinion
upon the working of the
London Office, pending fur-
ther enquiry now being held
by the Commission in Lon-
don, we are able to congrat-
ulate your Excellency on the
fact that the charges brought
against the Premier have
been proved completely un-
founded.” On going to a
division Mr. Archer’s
amendment wavS carried by
27 votes to 20.
Among the measures
passed in 1880 had been
Railway Bills for the com-
pletion of the second section
of the line from Bundaberg
to Mount Perry, the exten-
sion of the central railway
to Clermont, together with
a line linking Sandgate with
Brisbane, including a branch
to the racecourse.
The beginning of a
movement destined to gain
strength every year until it accomplished its purpose
in the affirmation of the principle of a “White Aus-
tralia,” found expression in a measure relating to
indentured Polynesian labourers, and circumscribing
the work in which they could be employed. When South
Sea Islanders were first brought to the Colony there was
no restriction as to their service, for they were employed
in the mills, where the engineer and sugar boiler were
often the only white men engaged, while kanakas were
very frequently placed in charge of horses and drays
conveying cane to the rollers. Gradually the Polynesians
were cut out of all such work, and were restricted
wholly to work in the fields.
Yet another Bill fated to divide the Colony
politically, as did the steel rails question, was intro-
duced in Sejhember, 1880. The title of the measure,
The Railway Companies Preliminary Bill, gives little
indication of the reason for the determined opposition
it aroused. In truth, it was the first step in the trans-
continental railway scheme formulated by the Premier
and always associated with his political career, lire
object of the land-grant system of railway construction
was to relieve the taxpayers and avert the necessity for
increasing the loan indebtedness of the Colony. The
system, as it was contemplated in the measure intro-
duced by the Mcllwraith Government, provided that
grants of land might be
made to railway contractors,
who should be either com-
panies or individuals, that
the amount so given should
not exceed 8,000 acres per
mile of railway built, the
/and to be in alternate
blocks, with the object of
raising the value of the in-
tervening areas which would
be held by the Govern-
ment, the argument being
that the increased price
at which that land would be
purchased would more than
recoup the State for the
grants for railway construc-
tion. The areas granted
were to be on each side of
the line and adjoining or
adjacent to it. There was
in the Bill a provision that
the Governor -in - Council
could, at any time after
the expiration of five
years, purchase the rail-
way, rolling-stock, etc., at
a fair and reasonable
valuation. The arguments in furtherance of the pro-
posal were based, as we have said, on the practical
benefits the system would confer on the Colony, and the
Premier in introducing the measure pointed out that
the public debt was very large in proportion to the
population, while further in support of the land-grant
system it was stated that the Crown lands of Queens-
land in area were very greatly in excess of any of the
other Colonies. Mr. Mcllwraith went on to explain that
when in England he had found that a railway from
Roma to the Gulf of Carpentaria could be built under
the system proposed if the Bill passed through Parlia-
ment. The measure passed the Lower House, but when
SIR CHARLES COWPER.


it was dealt with by the Legislative Council an objection
was raised to the clause restricting the use of Asiatic
or African labour by the contractors to a distance of
200 miles from the Gulf. On being returned to the
Lower House the latter insisted on the retention of
the clause, and the Council re-inserted the provision.
Another clause which was of great importance gave the
concession to the contractors of importing all railway
material free of Customs dues.
Not least by any means among the factors of
opposition to land grants, and contributing also largely
to the growing unpopularity of the Government, was the
provision for the partial use of cheap coloured labour in
the building of the line. There was at this time no
room for illusion on the attitude of the electors in the
southern centres of population in regard to alien labour :
in fact, there was determined opposition to coloured
labour in all the towns, northern and central as well
as southern. The workers had begun to feel their power,
and were saying that it was their duty to care for their
own interests. Opposition to the indentation of Poly-
nesians was strengthening, and thus the hostile cry that
"coolies were coming” aroused the stern determination
that at all costs they should not come. The “White
Australia” flag had been hoisted.
On the other side, which opponents declined to
consider, or even look at, there was the argument that
elsewhere the land-grant system of railway construction
had been adopted and nothing very dreadful had
resulted. The Canadian Pacific railway was a case in
point; and the Queensland measure was to a great
extent based on the system adopted in the Dominion
for linking the Atlantic with the Pacific provinces. The
success which attended the transcontinental railway in
Canada, indeed, should move us to consider whether our
own Colony was altogether wise in having nothing to do
with the land-grant system, which in other forms and
other spheres had been widely tested and approved.
Beyond that there was always the power to amend
objectionable details. And it must not be forgotten, in
justice to the promoters of the line, that we are now,
forty years after the transcontinental railway was
vetoed, working for a railway system very similar to
that it would have given us, although built by the State,
for we do not only aim at the extension of the coastal
railway to the extreme north, but also seek the junction
of southern, central, and northern railways in the west
by a line which when completed will not be an imperfect
imitation of the historical transcontinental line. It is
true that our railways are owned by the State, but it
is no less true that a land subsidy measure for railway
building was agreed to in 1892. Facts seem to point
strongly to the belief that it was persons not principles
who were so strongly opposed in the eighties, and yet
it is as easy to see that great statesmanship animated
the inauguration of the proposal if increased popula-
tion, expanded settlement, and a large addition to the
natural wealth are the main objects of colonial
statecraft.
The Leader of the Government, who, in November,
1882, had been created a Knight Commander of the
Order of St. Michael and St. George, an honour con-
ferred previously on his brother in political arms, who
as Sir Arthur Palmer became President of the Legis-
lative Council, found other outlets for his energy, for
Sir Thomas McTlwraith, with a vision that saw further
into the future than many of his compeers, had taken
the bold step of annexing Papua. Acting under the
instruction of the Premier, Mr. Chester, who was Police
Magistrate at Thursday Island, hoisted the Union Jack
in New Guinea. Technically the action of the colonial
Premier in enlarging on his own initiative the bounds
of the Empire was unwarranted presumption, without
a shred of precedent to condone it, but practically it
was the wisest and most patriotic step that could have
been taken. Subsequent events have fully justified the
action of Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, 'ultra, vires though it
was. But Lord Derby, who was then Secretary of State
for the Colonies, had not the prescience of the Queens-
land statesman, and disallowed the annexation, thereby
entering into the political history of Australia as a
Minister with far less breadth of view than one of the
colonial Premiers, whose actions it was in his power to
\eto and annul. It was not long, indeed, before the
wisdom of Sir Thomas Mcllwraith and the fact that the
Colonial Office had blundered were both proved con-
clusively,. for Germany, who had even then entered
on the preparation for the Great War, and was already
looking with longing eyes to the Pacific and Australia,
seized the opportunity given by the offended dignity of
the Imperial Government, or rather of a member of it,
for hardly had the flag which Mr. Chester hoisted been
pulled down, than a German warship raised the Kaiser’s
eagle standard in Papua. It is needless to deal with
the outcome of the German policy in the Pacific as
evidenced by annexations north of Australia, or in the
securing of Samoa: that is history which is graven on
the soul of every citizen of the Commonwealth.
It is, however, of vital moment to remember that
had Sir Thomas Mcllwraith not been foiled, and his
truly Imperial policy brought to naught, it would not
have been necessary for an Australian Imperial Force
to annex German New Guinea and hold it. The Aus-
tralian expedition to Rabaul justified the act of the
Queensland Premier. And in connection with subse-
quent events it is very interesting to remember that the
annexation of Papua was very unpopular at the time
among a large section of the people of Queensland, being
considered a flamboyant attempt to secure prestige.
"The King is dead; long live the King,” is a phrase


far more applicable to the political leader than a
monarch on a throne, for the electors are as fickle as
their passing moods. Things had moved rapidly since
the vote was taken on the steel-rails question, which
was decided, as we have said, on a purely party vote,
from which, however, Mr. A. Meston, member for
Rosewood, must be excepted, for that gentleman,
although Whip for the Opposition, had the courage of
his opinions, and voted with the Government. The
Administration had indeed either outlived its popularity
or offended the political sensibilities of the majority of the
electors, who were led to believe that there was a deeply-
laid plot against their freedom and prosperity. No
matter, however, what was the cause of the change, the
result was clear, for a
political party, like an
individual, without any
apparent cause, may fall
on evil days. And so
it came to be with the
first Mcll wraith Ministry.
In the election which
took place in 1883 the Lib-
erals, under the leadership
of Mr. Griffith, proved
that the strength of the
Ministry was only a shadow.
The Opposition became the
Government.
Mr. Griffith became
Premier, Colonial Secre-
tary, and Minister for Pub-
lic Instruction, while the
other members of the Min-
istry were;—Mr. W. Miles,
Minister for Works and
Mines; Mr. C. B. Dutton,
Minister for Lands; Mr.
J. F. Garrick, Post-
master-General, Treasurer,
and Leader of the Gov-
ernment in the Upper
House; Mr. A. Rutledge, Attorney-General. The
Minister without portfolio was Mr. R. B. Sheridan,
who had on retiring from the Sub-Collectorship of
Customs in Maryborough sought and received Parlia-
mentary honours. Later Mr. J. R. Dickson, on his
return from a visit to England, succeeded Mr. Garrick
in the Treasury.
The first years of the Griffith Administration are
noteworthy for the initiation of movements, at the
first glance antagonistic, but in reality operative from
different causes and on a different plane, for just as the
Australian Colonies, as a whole, found it would be
necessary to seek some centre of administration for
interests and business common to all, so did the citizens
of North Queensland begin to ask why they should be
governed from a point in the extreme south of the
Colony. The first step towards Federation was taken
as the year 1883 was passing away, for in December of
that year a convention met in Sydney to consider the
inauguration of federal relations. The outcome of the
deliberations of delegates from the various Colonies,
among whom, perhaps, Mr. Griffith exerted most
influence, was the Federal Councils Bill. To us who
look back it must be a cause of wonder why the results
of the convention should be embodied in a Bill, for,
after all, those who drew up that measure and passed
it were no more than a body advisory to the Imperial
Government and Parlia-
ment. In truth the old-time
system of acting through a
petition to the Throne, if too
much indulged in by previ-
ous generations in the Col-
onies, seemed more appro-
priate for attaining the
object than was a Bill.
The convention attained its
desires, after more than one
conference on the subject, in
1885, when the Imperial
Statute constituting the
Federal Council was passed
by the House of Commons
and House of Lords. A point
of interest to Australians to-
day is found in the fact
that the Federal Council
Act had a scope much wider
even than the Common-
wealth, subsequently consti-
tuted, for it contemplated
federal relations not only
among Australian Colonies,
bnt also New Zealand and
Fiji, and, indeed, representa-
tives of New Zealand were present at a confer-
ence held in Sydney, and attended by delegates
from the Australian Colonies, one of the objects
of the convention being to make joint representation
on the subject of the annexation of Papua, to which we
have alluded. While the Federal Council was assuredly
the forerunner of Federation, the Commonwealth did
not and could not evolve from the Council. Another
series of conventions took place later which gave Aus-
tralia the federal relations under which Australians
live. There are those of the wider vision who look
forward to a confederation of the Australian Common-
wealth and the New Zealand Dominion, together with
THOMAS SUTCLIFFE MORT.


all the island groups in the Western Pacific over which
flies the British flag, and what was contemplated by the
framers of the Federal Council in the eighties we may
yet consider possible.
It is difficult for us who live under Federal Govern-
ment to understand the excitement which attended the
movement for separation in the eighties. More than
that, it is not easy for anyone who has only lived in the
Southern districts of Queensland to realize how strong
was the feeling aroused in the North. So violently
indeed were the forces on either side arrayed one against
the other that on occasions there was rioting. It must
be confessed that the Separationists had much on which
to base their claims, for the scheme was no novel one.
Statesmen, in the days when Queensland as a whole had
made good her right to self-government, had looked to
the formation of another Colony in north-eastern Aus-
tralia, and indeed that was the argument used by Mr.
John Macrossan in a motion which he tabled in the
Legislative Assembly, that the time had arrived when
the separation contemplated by the Duke of Newcastle
in 1859 should take place. Ten members of the northern
constituencies were pledged to do all that lay in their
power to bring about the creation of a new Colony, north
of a line drawn from Cape Palmerston, south of Mackay
and opposite the Percy Islands, westward to the South
Australian border. On the surface, the arguments were
cogent and not easy to dispute. For it was asserted
that Northern Queensland had a population of 60,000
and a revenue of <£600,000, being thus in a far more
advanced position than Moreton Bay Settlement when
it obtained autonomous government. That argument
was difficult to combat, for it simply stated a fact, as
did also the appeal to the expressed foresight of a former
Secretary of State for the Colonies. When, however, the
Separationists avowed their determination not to be
governed by interests and influences centred in a town
in the extreme south-eastern portion of the Colony, they
at once stepped on contentious ground, for it was
asserted that in addition to the championing of the
separation cause by the sugar men, as they were termed,
there was also very strong support given to the move-
ment by those who were interested in the advancement
of Townsville, and desirous to see that growing city
and seaport the capital of the proposed Colony. So con-
scious were the advocates of separation that Townsville
simply reproduced the evils complained of in regard to
Brisbane, for it would be at one end of the new
Colony, jugt as was Brisbane in regard to the
whole territory, that it was averred that a capital
in some central spot was to be created. Facts, and
human nature, seem to give reason for the belief that
Townsville’s enthusiasm in the movement had a practical
business aspect. There may have been sound reason
underlying the further argument that the North had
always been treated unjustly in the disbursement of the
public expenditure, and more than that, in the
insufficient representation in Parliament which it had
been given as compared with the Southern districts.
During three weeks the question was debated in
Parliament, Mr. Hume Black, member for Mackay,
being one of the most forceful advocates of separation.
The question, however, had another aspect, and it was
on that phase probably that the adverse vote was given
which diminished, though it did not extinguish, the
hopes of the Separationists. For in truth it was the
outlook on the sugar industry which was really in
question. Right away to the far north sugar was king
on the coast, and even beyond Cairns and Port Douglas,
to a point but little south of Cooktown, which in turn
was a thousand miles north of Brisbane, sugar-growing
was being carried on with profit by means of kanaka
labour. Every man engaged in the industry could at
the time see the writing on the wall, traced in clear
terms by the great majority of electors in the south,
and the writing was that “the kanakas must go.”
Under the circumstances it did not require supernatural
astuteness to suspect that a northern Colony, desired
mainly in the interests of the sugar-growers, would have
as one of its main institutions coloured labour. Of
course all this was strenuously denied, and Mr. Hume
Black asserted that those interested in the sugar indus-
try only sought fairplay, which they could never hope
for so long as their destiny was controlled by the south.
Meanwhile the supporters of the separation move-
ment made a brave fight for their object, and defeated
in the colonial Parliament, despatched delegates to
London to impress their views on the Colonial Office.
It cannot be averred that Messrs. I. Lissner and H.
Black, who were the missioners of the separation cult,
met with great success, for Sir Henry Holland, who was
at that time in charge of colonial affairs, told the dele-
gates with suave sarcasm that their arguments for
separation “were not strong enough.” And with that
reply the delegates returned to Queensland.
Among the members of the Ministry was Mr. C.
B. Dutton, who represented Leichhardt in the Legis-
lative Assembly. Mr. Dutton was a pastoralist, popu-
lar with his fellows in the industry, and indeed
deservedly held in high estimation on all sides. As
Minister lor Lands he atoned for lack of experience in
Parliamentary life by his enthusiasm for the new views
on the subject promulgated by the American thinker,
Henry George, whose volume, “Progress and Poverty”
was the book of the day. The Secretary for Lands was
not content to read and approve the theory that land
was no subject for private possession, that it could no
more be claimed as individual property than the air we
breathe. Mr. Dutton was not satisfied with arguing on


the advantage given through the utilization by a State
of the increasing value of the land of a country in mini-
mising taxation, promoting progress and eliminating
poverty. He sought to transform into practice Henry
George’s theories concerning the benefit which the com-
munity as a whole would derive from that which he
termed the unearned increment in the value of land, en-
joyed by private ownership without being earned. The
conclusions at which Mr. George arrived were certainly
pleasing, but the results in the practical applica-
tion were not so satisfactory, for as a revenue-
producer the Dutton Land Act of 1884 was not a
success.
The whole question of
leasehold versus freehold had
tendrils too deeply rooted in
the minds of men on the
land to be settled out of
hand by even so- persuasive a
theorist as Henry George.
That the Act did not give
the revenue anticipated can-
not be denied, and it is no
defence of the new legisla-
tion to assert that the seasons
were against it. The point,
however, remains that there
must have been strong belief
in the practical benefit
derived from subdividing
runs and in the justice- with
which the rights of pastoral
lessees were safeguarded.
That the squatters were
treated well is proved by the
fact that they favoured the
measure. It cannot be
doubted that there was
something attractive in the
proposal to increase the rev-
enue from land through sub-
dividing pastoral leases and raising the rent of the
grazing farms constituted from the resumed portions of
the runs, but in practice things did not work out in
the manner desired, and the Colony stood to face a
large burden for loan interest, for which there was not
an adequate revenue. Quite an interesting and
important episode in the introduction of advanced land
legislation was afforded by the attitude of Mr. Dixon in
regard to the leasing of land. Mr. Dixon, as an
eminently successful business man, one whose knowledge
of land values was second to none, was in no wise dis-
posed to allow theory to take the bit in its teeth and run
away with him. Asa common-sense method of extricating
c
file Colony from financial difficulty Mr. Dixon sug-
gested there should be recourse to sales of land. He was
opposed in this by the Premier as well as by Mr. Dutton,
and as a result Mr. Dixon resigned his portfolio. In
that act, and in the pressing need for money which some
years later led to the enactment of a legislative measure
entitled the Special Sales of Land Act, we have the
strongest commentary and criticism of the Dutton
measure and the system underlying it. And yet, having
said all this, it is impossible either to condemn the
reasoning on which the Act was based, or to assert that
any but the highest motives animated the authors of the
measure. Evolution works slowly, and those who
anticipate it invariably pay
the penalty.
That jiortion of the Act
which has most interest for
us in these days is un-
doubtedly Part IV., which
inaugurated the system of
grazing and agricultural
farms, for a new method of
dealing with Crown land
was introduced, and has,
indeed, been accepted as the
basis of all evolution in land
legislation in regard to graz-
ing farms. It was provided
that survey before selecting
should be the rule, although
there was room left for
the suspension of that
provision by the Govern or-
in-Council under recom-
mendation of the Land
Board. There were also
provisions made for tem-
porary survey. In the
case of agricultural farms
there was provision for
selection after proclamation.
In the case of land in an agricultural area the
maximum area that could be selected was 1,280 acres,
while in other areas the maximum was 20,000 acres and
the minimum 2,560 acres. The rent charged varied
from not less than 3d. per acre in an agricultural area
to not less than Id. per acre in other cases. There was
provision, in the case of agricultural land, for the lessee
to purchase in fee simple at a price to be fixed by a
proclamation, but not less than 15s. per acre. Holders
of grazing farms had as a condition of their lease the
enclosing of their land with a good and substantial
fence. In subsequent years the inroads of rabbits
caused the framing of a provision compelling the erection
SIR JOHN HAY.


of a rabbit-proof fence in certain parts of the country.
It was within the province of the Board to permit
holders of farms adjoining each other, and when these
did not exceed four in number, to combine and fence
for protection against rabbits on the external boundaries
only. The Board was subsequently given discretion in
granting concessions as to time in regard to
rabbit-proof fencing, an extension up to two years being
provided for in cases where the lessee could give a
sufficient reason for his inability to comply with the
provision. The term of lease under which an agricul-
tural farm could be held was fifty years, but owing to
subsequent legislation in the Agricultural Lands Pur-
chase Act of 1894 that tenure of lease was reduced to
twenty years in places where land had been proclaimed
open to conditional selection. It is very interesting to
note that a step which was obviously made in obedience
to the expression of public opinion and the necessity of
providing for settlement —and revenue—was quite out
of touch with the leasing principle. The tenure under
which a grazing farm could be held was limited to
thirty years, save in the case where rabbit-proof fencing
had been erected, and where an Extension Act, intro-
duced later, provided for the lease being extended to a
further period of five years. In regard to the rental of
grazing farms the amount payable during the first ten
years was fixed by proclamation, the Board assessing the
subsequent periods, which were each of five years.
CHAPTER XXV.
CIVIC, SOCIAL, AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.
Turning from the most important political epoch
in the history of the Colony to its advancement in things
civic, social, and industrial subsequent to the discovery
of gold at Gympie, it will be of interest to take a retro-
spect of life in Queensland in various aspects in order
that we may see.the Colony in different stages. We have
already shown the vast impetus which self-government
gave to the Colony, yet for the purposes of comparison
it will be well to note that as the result of the first
census taken in the Colony in 1861 the population was
found to be 30,059. Seven years later, in March, 1868,
another census was taken, and the population was then
estimated to be 99,312; while two years later it had
increased by 10,000 persons. The six most densely
populated districts at the end of 1870 were as follows :
East Moreton, 13,912, of whom 7,486 were males and
6,426 females. The district of North Brisbane had in
its bounds 9,172 souls, 4,526 being males and 4,646
females. In West Moreton the total number was
7,684, 4,090 being males and 3,594 females. Wide
Bay followed closely on the heels of West Moreton with
7,351 persons, of whom 6,199 were males and 1,152
females. The population of the Rockhampton district
was 6,086, 3,236 being males and 2,850 females. In
the district of Drayton and Toowoomba the population
was 6,032, of whom 3,056 were males and 2,976
females.
Brisbane, as was fitting, took the lead in civic life,
the municipality, which comprised the three electorates
of North Brisbane, South Brisbane, and Fortitude Val-
ley, having been constituted just before separation. There
were in 1870 six wards, each returning two aldermen.
They were East, West, North, and South Wards, the
Valley and Kangaroo Point. There was a population of
14,265 within the bounds of the municipality, the
estimated area of which was 2,183 acres, while the
dwellings numbered 2,950. The roads and streets
represented a total of forty-seven miles. The number
of ratepayers seems to have been small compared with
the population, being at the time only 3,975. The
rateable property was valued at £852,090, the annual
value being £85,209. It is interesting to note that the
general rate of Brisbane, and all the other municipalities
in the Colony save one, was Is. in the pound, being
the maximum levy permitted by the Act. The excep-
tion was Gayndah, where the rate was Bd. in the pound.
The total revenue of the Brisbane Town Council was
£10,568 12s. 7d. from all sources, and the expenditure
was £9,100 15s. 2d. It is stated that rather unsuccessful
bridge-making and the erection of the Town Hall were
responsible for the large debt-burden the municipality
had to bear.
Ipswich, as was meet, followed the capital closely
in the winning of municipal honours, for the town was
incorporated in 1860. The civic population totalled
5,021, and there were 1,182 dwellings within the muni-
cipal bounds. The mileage of roads and streets was 33,
while the ratepayers numbered 491. The value in all
of rateable property was estimated at £338,478, the
annual value being £24,177. The total annual revenue
was £1,478 14s. Bd., the expenditure being £1,415
6s. 9d.
Toowoomba became a municipality in 1860, and
was divided into three wards, each being represented
by three aldermen. The population totalled 3,020,
with 718 dwellings. The roads and streets represented
a total length of forty-five miles, while the number of
ratepayers on the roll was 943. The rateable property
in 1869 was valued at £160,078, while the annual value
was £24,632. The revenue was £1,933 4s. 5d., while
the expenditure was £2,196 10s.
The municipal bounds of Rockhampton, which

acquired local government in 1861, were wide, com-
prising 15,000 acres, the population totalled 5,000,
while the total number of dwellings was 1,000. In all
the mileage of the roads and streets was 75. There
were 1,392 ratepayers on the register, while the total
value of rateable property was £557,000, and the
annual value £44,578. The revenue was £6,360 and
the expenditure £7,917. It will be seen that Rock-
hampton ranked only second to Brisbane in municipal
importance, while on the other hand, the one-time
clamorous voice of Ipswich for-place and power as the
metropolis must have ceased for lack of material argu-
ment.
Maryborough was constituted a municipality in
1861, and the city fathers in those days must hare
possessed a vaulting ambition concerning its future, for
the area within the civic bounds was 25,000 acres. The
population was 3,500, and the number of dwellings 650.
The total mileage of the roads and streets was 74.
There were 1,000 ratepayers on the roll, while the
estimated value of rateable property was £250,000, and
the annual value £23,840. The revenue amounted to
£2,977, while the expenditure was £3,482.
In 1861 Warwick graduated in things civic with a
population of 2,000, and the number of ratepayers 524.
There were in all 405 dwellings and 46 miles of roads
and streets within the municipal bounds. The rateable
property was valued at £170,590, the annual value
being given at £17,059, while the revenue was £969,
and the expenditure £1,628.
There were ten municipalities in addition to the
foregoing centres of local government, but in each the
population numbered less than 2,000. They were Dray-
ton, Gladstone, Bowen, D.alby, Townsville, Gayndah,
Clermont and Copperfield (proclaimed a joint muni-
cipality), Roma (the most westerly municipality in the
Colony), Allora, and Mackay. All the latter towns are
shown in the order in which they came of age in civic
rights, the last to be proclaimed being Mackay, con-
stituted a municipality in 1869. A realistic touch is
given in regard to Clermont in the annals of those
bygone days, for it is stated that during the preceding
month of February all the books and records of the
Town Council were swept away by a flood, and no
statistics were available.
Turning to the question of immigration during the
years of which we are now writing, we find that the
increase in population bears witness to a well-founded be-
lief in the specially favourable opportunities the Colony
offered for settlement. It has been seen that prior to
the financial crisis of 1866 a lack of wisdom had been
displayed in hurrying out settlers from the Homeland
before there had been due preparation for their coming
or the question solved of what was to be done with
them when they came. The immigration returns
of 1869 show that during that year there was
a very sound belief in the Colony as a home
for strong, well-centred men, their wives, and their
families, and the proof comes to us in the fact that
while immigration from the United Kingdom repre-
sented 1,921, the inflow of settlers from the other
Australian Colonies totalled 4,443. It is true that
departures from Queensland to the other Colonies repre-
sented 6,715, but there is good reason to believe that
number does not imply that those who came to Queens-
land were dissatisfied with their lot, but rather that
people coming out to New South Wales, Victoria, or
the other Colonies found that it paid them to take their
passage to Brisbane, the deceit entering into the business
through their masquerade as intending settlers in the
Colony did not seem to trouble them. Advantage
was taken of the liberality of the Queensland
Government in regard to shipping facilities to
Brisbane and the other ports. The fact remains
that the number of departures to other Colonies
amounted to some 351 persons more than all the immi-
grants from the British Isles. There was, it is true,
during the year an excess of departures as compared
with arrivals, but when allowance is made for the
awakening from the golden dream, under whose
lure so many came to the Colony at that time, the
excess is not over much. The fact, however, that 4,443
people came to Queensland from the sister Colonies
is perhaps the strongest evidence we can have that it
was recognized that the foundations of a stable and
excellent prosperity had been laid, for those nearest
to us are always our most just critics, because they
know, and as it is with individuals so it is with com-
munities. When we recall how real a factor inter-
colonial jealousy was in Australian life in pre-Federation
days we can attach full value to the favourable con-
sideration the northern Colony received from residents
in other parts of Australia when the grave question of
how they could improve their condition came up for
decision. And we can sec that even then Queensland
was justifying her claim to first place among the Colonies,
for not altogether was the attraction due to the gold-
fields. It is interesting to learn that among the arrivals
during the year were 327 South Sea Islanders, being
213 in excess of departures for Polynesia, and that,
indeed, may be taken as a fair indication that the labour
traffic was being vigorously carried on.
The circumstances as they were in regard to
shipping in those days give one an excellent idea of
the enormous strides Queensland has made in fifty
years. In 1869 there were practically no steamers
in the port of Brisbane other than intercolonial vessels,
and although the propeller had begun to jostle the
paddle-steamer into the side eddies of marine trade
and work, the coastal traffic, as far as Queensland was


concerned, was largely maintained by the old-fashioned
side-wheelers. And they were not leviathans by any
means, for the “Queensland” and the “Lady Bowen”
did not register more than 300 or 400 tons in burden.
Very safe and comfortable boats they were and well known
to travellers, for they were the only means of communica-
tion between Rockhampton, Maryborough, Brisbane, and
Sydney, although Cobb’s far-famed coaches linked up
Gympie on the one side with Brisbane, and on the other
with Maryborough. Brisbane, being the port for the
most thickly-populated districts to the west and south,
was without a rival in any sense. It was true that
beyond Brisbane there was Ipswich, linked not only
with the capital by coach, but also by steamer. Very
leisurely, indeed, was the navigation to the up-river port
in the last year of the sixties, yet pleasurable for all
much worry and hustle, for all unloading operations
weie carried on in the bay, and if it were desired to
bring the ship u]) the river—it was always a sailing
vessel from overseas that was in question —the reaches
could only be navigated after the vessel was unloaded
by lighters. The ports of Rockhampton and Mary-
borough came next in importance to Brisbane, the
former with 95 vessels inward and 77 outwards, and
the latter with 59 vessels inward, while the
clearances represented 70. Nothing perhaps could indi-
cate the small size of the coastal steamers more clearly
than the proposal mooted in those days, that the
Narrows between Port Curtis and Keppel Bay should
be deepened, and it was asserted this could be done at
a comparatively small cost, in order that the voyage
between Gladstone and Rockhampton might be

that. One cast loose from the Brisbane wharf at
9 a.m., and after many a halt en route at wayside
wharfs to leave parcels and embark or disembark
passengers, Ipswich was reached after lunch, about
2 o’clock. An interesting trip it was, for in those days
the river banks were thickly populated with farmers,
and not a few sugar plantations were to be seen on the
trip. In the coastal traffic a system pertained differ-
ing wnolly from that in use now, for then the steamers
were made to fit the rivers, not the rivers deepened to
suit the steamers. In all 250 vessels, of a total burden
of 74.309 tons, entered the port during the year, and
clearances outward represented 227 ships, with a total
of 72,195 tons. In those days the arrival of what was
deemea a large vessel—l,soo or 2,000 tons —meant
shortened. This is an enlightening suggestion, in view
of the fact that many years later, when the northern
railway had been built as far as Gladstone, and the last
section of the line to Rockhampton was in course of
construction, it was found necessary to build a steamer
of specially shallow draught in order to convey
passengers through the Narrows to Rockhampton.
Townsville, it is noteworthy, in 1869 stood side
by side with Bowen in regard to its coastal trade,
the vessels entering at Cleveland Bay in 1869 being 28,
while the clearances were 30. At Port Denison 29
vessels entered and 28 cleared. In both cases ships of
large size were compelled to unload in the roadsteads,
and that despite the fact that Bowen had been dowered
with a jetty 2,000 ft. in length, due, it was said, to the


kindly consideration of Sir Arthur Palmer for the
northern town, for vessels drawing more than 9 ft.
could not in those days berth at Bowen. The latter
town was the outlet of what was then known as a
magnificent pastoral district, while Townsville, for
which the gods had future gifts in the discovery of
Charters Towers gold, drew its importance at the time
of which we speak from the goldfields at the Cape and
Gilbert Rivers. Yet other points of assistance in tracing
the picture of the Colony as it was at the end of the
sixties are to be found in the fact that Broadsound was
then the port for the Peak Downs Copper Mine, and
was noted for the rapidity with which the tides rose
and fell, and also the extent of the rise, which varied
from 20 to 36 feet. Again Baffle Creek, south of Glad-
stone, was described as a port frequented by coasters,
while Cardwell, of which many things were expected,
was noted as the most northerly point at which a Custom
house had been established. In 1869 the overland
telegraph line to the Gulf branched off at Cardwell,
and a year later steamship communication was estab-
lished with Brisbane. In the brief survey of the coastal
traffic it is of interest to note that trade in the Gulf of
Carpentaria was causing Normanton to rise into promin-
ence, an important factor in the centring of business
there being the convenience the port represented in
regard to traffic with the gold and copper fields at
Cloncurry. The most northerly point of settlement was
Albany, near Cape York, which was then a free port.
It is questionable whether those who know Brisbane
as it is to-day wttuld meet much that is familiar to them
were time to wheel back and give them a glimpse of the
city as it was in 1869 or 1870. There were no palatial
buildings, no embankment linking Queen Street with
the height which looks down into the Valley, the chief
means of communication being Wickham Street. There
was no imposing Custom House and its somewhat outre
architecture to attract attention, and up and down
Queen Street plodded now and then a heavily-laden
bullock-dray. Jolting and noisy omnibuses were the
very imperfect forerunners of the efficient tramway
system, which twelve or thirteen years later began its
evolution from horse-traction to electricity as a motive
power. The horse represented the sole mode of speedy
communication for the business man, while a moderately
comfortable vehicle termed a Melbourne car, and the
more commodious hansom, were the ancestors of the
motor-cars of to-day. There was a town hall, but it
was not over-highly estimated, though it had cost much
money. The post office as it is to-day did not exist,
a small building in George Street serving the purpose
of the citizens and the country. Queen Street had
many a gap in it. Those who saw it in those days had
they the gift of prophecy might have said that the
child city had not cut its teeth. And yet the shops
were excellent, and catered well for the wants of their
customers. Among those which come to the memory of
any who knew Queen Street as it was then were the
establishments of E. F. Edwards, Finney, Isles, & Co.,
Grimes & Petty, and John Forsyth & Co. Not yet
was the railway extended to Brisbane, and there was
no station at Roma Street, though a year later excav-
ation work at the site of the old terminus gave token
of what was to be. Communication between the
northern and the southern sections of the city was
still by ferry-boat and punt. If Queen Street had
many gaps in those days Stanley Street, South Brisbane,
had still more, while from a point not far from where
River Terrace now stands there was a pretty view
obtained from a bridle track, one of the means of com-
munication with Kangaroo Point, where was the ferry
whence the coach from Ipswich wheeled into town.
Fortitude Valley was a busy place, and along the
Hamilton Road was as pleasant a ride as could be
desired. Ipswich was within riding distance in one
direction, as was the pretty sea-front at Sandgate in
another. Government House as it was, with the sentry,
lifle in hand, at the lodge-gate, is only a memory now.
The rooms devoted to social functions are now dedicated
to the uses of the University professors.
In six years much may happen in a young Colony,
and the advancement experienced in Queensland in the
period between 1869 and 1875 was no exception to the
rule, but rather proved it emphatically. In 1874 Bris-
bane had greatly advanced, and Queen Street was
beginning to assume a metropolitan air, although it
cannot be said that all the spaces were filled. In
that year a fine bridge across the river, linking the
northern portion of the city with South Brisbane, was
completed, being formally opened by the Marquis of
Normanby, who was then Governor of the Colony. In
the vice-regal regime of Sir George Bowen there had
been a great effort made at bridge-building, and a
wooden and temporary structure, intended as an aid in
erecting a permanent bridge, was made available for
traffic. It was whispered that the antagonism of
Ipswich, as much as the flood-waters which swept down
from that ambitious town, caused the failure of the
project. One thing is certain, that Ipswich had
influence sufficient to save her dignity as a port through
the provision made in early bridge structures for open-
ing, in order to permit of the passage of shipping up
stream. Probably the fact that there never was any
call for the opening of the bridge caused that system
to be laid aside in later structures. In justice, however,
to the citizens of the up-river port, it must be stated
that the hard time of financial depression in the mid-
sixties probably had much to do with the failure to
proceed with the building of the projected iron
structure. No matter where the reason lay, a flood


having partially demolished the temporary bridge, the
beginnings of that which was to be the first permanent
structure lifted their broken heads above the stream in
the first years of the seventies, as if in protest. And
it is not for us who live in later days to smile at foiled
hopes, for a flood has more than once demolished
structures subsequently erected. The bridge made
available for traffic in 1874 was, however, the pledge
that never again, save temporarily, would Brisbane be
without speedy means of communication between her
communities of the north and south. At this time also
the railway connection of the Southern and Western
districts with Brisbane was completed. On October 5
the first section of the line from Ipswich to the capital
was finished and opened for traffic as far as Sherwood,
a distance of some seventeen miles. In February, 1875,
the line was completed as far as Oxley Point, while on
1861 there were but 4,480 acres under cultivation,
in 1869 the area had increased to 47,034 acres, whilst
in 1873 the acreage stood at 64,218. All through
the early years maize had been the leading crop, but
just as sugar-growing had overtaken and passed cotton
cultivation in the favour with which it was held, so
was sugar destined to take the place of Indian corn
as the most important primary production of the Colony.
In 1869 the land under sugar was 5,165 acres, and four
years later the area was 14,495 acres. In order to form a
just estimation of what that meant to Queensland we
must remember that in 1864 there were only 93 acres
devoted to sugar-growing. The sugar manufactured in
1873 was tons, and there were also other pro-
ducts 164,413 proof gallons of rum, and 442,253 gallons
of molasses. The return of sugar does not give any
information concerning the average amount of sugar
ROMA STREET LOOKING ACROSS THE RIVER TO SOUTH BRISBANE IN THE EARLY SIXTIES.
June 14 there was no missing link in the southern
railway system, for on that day the extension to
Brisbane was opened in its entirety, and the station at
Roma Street, where the erection of suitable buildings
had been going on for some years, became the terminus
of the southern and western railways.
In yet another phase of Brisbane’s life there was
advancement marked in the opening of the Cathedral
of the Roman Catholic diocese of Brisbane, which at
that time was under the administration of Bishop Quinn.
The Cathedral was a fine building of architectural
excellence, and had been eight years in course of
erection. The inaugural ceremonies and dedication took
place on May 17, 1874.
If we turn to agriculture we see how bright and
promising the picture becomes as the years pass. In
per acre, which was at that time stated to be one and a
half tons. Later, with the increased crushing power of
large central mills and more efficient methods of treating
O O
the juice in boiling, the return of the early days was
greatly exceeded. In comparing the acreage with the
sugar extracted it must always be remembered that not
all of the cane on a farm is cut every year. In those
days, although it was anticipated that eventually
the wants of Queensland would be wholly supplied
by her own plantations, that time had not yet arrived,
and refined sugar was imported. Different grades of
sugar were produced, according to the machinery avail-
able and the skill of the sugar-boiler, the variety bringing
the highest price being brewers’ crystals, which sold at
£4O per ton, while at the lower end of the market was
ration sugar, which brought from £2B to £3O per ton.


In all there were sixty-six sugar-mills and ten distilleries
in 1873. The maximum and minimum prices for sugar
seem to have been widely apart, but were caused
by the great difference in the machinery used, which
varied from efficient steam-roller power with vacuum
pan-boiling to horse-power mills and the “open battery’’
of the old West India days. In 1873 Mackay had made
good its claim of being a sugar centre with 4,548 acres
under cane cultivation. It is interesting to note
the large amount of rum that was distilled in those
days. And yet we find the complaint was voiced that
there was a considerable leakage of profit owing to the
waste of skimmings and inferior grades of molasses, due
to the regulation that at no mill rum was permitted to
be made when the capacity of the mill was not equal to
manufacturing one and a half tons of sugar per diem.
It is a little difficult to understand how the authorities
arrived at the decision that it was inexpedient for any
mill below a given capacity to possess a still, except on
the reasoning that the owner of the smaller mills could
not afford to pay for the necessary supervision and the
services of an excise officer.
It is not improbable that if denatured alcohol be
proved economically preferable to petrol a use may be
found for by-products in sugar manufacture that would
increase still further the importance of the sugar
industry and also enable China cane and sorghum to be
cultivated on the southern seaboard of the State for the
production of liquid fuel. As sugar rose in favour so did
cotton fall, the larger returns from the former product
tempting farmers to abandon a crop the value of which
was ruled by conditions wholly beyond control in Aus-
tralia. The Southern States of the American Union
and India as centres of production had lowered the
price, with the result that while we find 14,426
acres were devoted to cotton in 1869, the area had
diminished to 9,663 acres four years later. The value
of the cotton exported in 1873 was £48,673, as against
£51,217 in the former period. In regard to wheat-
growing, it is of interest to note that the Toowoomba
district increased its production very considerably
between 1869 and 1873, for the area during the former
period was 776 acres, and in the latter year had risen
to 1,828 acres. Of the total area under wheat in
Queensland —3,554 acres, in 1873 —all save 61 acres was
situated in the Toowoomba or Warwick districts, Allora
being included, as far as the statistics were concerned,
in Warwick. Coal-mining was an industry that deve-
loped late, and we find that the value of coal mined
during 1869 was £5,907, representing a total quantity
of 4,120 tons. The value of coal and coke exported
from the Colony in 1873 was £1,248. The hope was
then expressed that, in the future, railway facilities
might enable the deposits of coal known to exist
to be developed profitably. The miners’ rights
issued at various goldfields form an interesting
evidence of the value attached to the different
diggings by miners, and it is instructive to
note that in 1869 Gympie stood first with the issue of
2,524 rights, the two fields next in favour being
Crocodile Creek and Cape River. Four years later the
fields in the lead with the issue of miners’ rights were
the Cape River, Broughton, and Charters Towers, the
grouped statistics of which showed that 2,418 rights had
been issued, Gympie standing second with 1,168. A
glance at the returns of gold-mining enables us to see
perhaps more fully than anything else how swiftly
Queensland was evolving towards great prosperity. If
we cast- our thoughts back to the year 1860 we find
that 4,127 oz. of gold of a value of £14,576 was won.
Nine years later the return became 130,944 oz. valued
at £451,352, while in 1873 the gold mined represented
194,895 oz. of a value of £717,540. Statistics in regard
to other minerals help us in gauging the Colony’s
advancement, and moie than that, also aid us in
realizing some of the factors in the prosperity attained.
In 1869 the copper mined totalled 6,310 tons of a value
of £76,230, while four years later the value of copper
and copper ore had risen to £200,699. The tin mined
was still more valuable, being returned at £397,291.
When Queensland started out on the great adven-
ture of self-government the actual revenue of the first
complete year as a Colony, 1860, was £178,589, and
the expenditure £180,103. Nine years subsequently the
revenue was £772,858, and the expenditure £770,796,
the revenue being inclusive of land orders to the amount
of £34,639. Four years later, in. 1873, the revenue had
increased to £1,124,107 (including land orders to the
amount of £4,072), the expenditure being £930,864.
From 1860 to 1866 imports and exports rose
rapidly, bearing witness to the advance of the
Colony, but in no year until 1867 did the
exports exceed the imports, giving sure proof that
the days of wealth-yielding production had come. In
that year the value of imports was £1,731,164, and
of exports £2,160,240, an excess of £429,076 in exports
over imports. In 1873 the imports had risen to
£2,739,933, but the exports continued to maintain the
lead, for in that year they represented a total of
£3,155,799. That Brisbane during all the years had
made good its claim to be the chief port of Queensland,
despite all criticism concerning the difficulties the
river presented to shipping, is proved from the fact that
more than two-thirds of the imports, or £2,011,263, and
more than one-half of the exports, £1,660,543, repre-
sented the shipping trade of the capital. Turning to a
very important product of the Colony which bulked
largely in the export trade, it is of great interest to note
that even in 1860 the wool shipped from the Colony
totalled 5,007,167 lb., of a value of £444,188. In 1869


the shipments of wool had risen to 22,386,650 lb., valued
at £1,098,149, while four years later the value of this
export totalled £1,374,526,
One obtains an insight in regard to the increasing
prosperity of the country by noting that there was an
advance in the payment of some phases of labour in 1874
as compared with 1870. Artisans who had been paid
Bs. to 9s. per diem received 10s. to 145., while farm
labourers who had been paid £25 to £3O per annum
received £35 to £SO. The pay of shepherds as to the
minimum wages ]rer annum rose £lO, the maximum
rate being unchanged. There was a rise of £2O in the
maximum yearly wages payable to married couples, the
rate in 1870 being £35 to £4O, while four years later
it was £35 to £6O. The Wages Act of 1870 deserves
a word in passing. From the opinion expressed at the
as some of us are prone lo believe. Away in the Far
North and out upon the western plains, where the
masters of flocks and herds led the van, life was
rough, but in the main there was sound reason for
satisfaction in more than one respect. As the result
of intercolonial conferences the telegraph system of the
country was worthily deemed subject for praise, and there
was room for great content in regard to the Torres
Strait mail service, which aroused in every patriotic
Queenslander an additional reason for championing it,
for it was the Colony’s own. There was good ground
for satisfaction in the thought that mails from Europe
arrived every ten days, the homeward-bound service
being as expeditiously carried on. We who see the
result of care in the nursing of a young industry may
devote a passing thought to the fact that the greatly

time it is clear that advantage must have been taken
of the law as it stood previously, and by which a
mortgagee who took possession of a property was not
liable for the wages which might be owing by the
mortgagor. The latter law changed all that, making
the mortgagee under the circumstances stated responsible
for wages due to employes up to a period of six months.
It is noteworthy that there should have been a very
marked tendency in the early seventies towards going on
the land with the object, not of leasing it, but of owning
it. In view of the legislation which was subsequently
introduced, and which has been dealt with in connection
with land legislation, the point is important.
The citizens of those days did not worry through life
the victims of hard times and untoward circumstances,
important oyster fisheries in Moreton Bay and elsewhere
on the Queensland coast were during 1874 safeguarded
by wise legislation. There was a time when the high
reputation Moreton Bay oysters enjoyed in the South was
endangering the very existence of the industry. The
steps taken in precaution against oyster piracy were
sufficient and successful. Of that the fishery to-day
is witness.
With reference to the water police, it is of
interest to know that the force was in the main
appointed because, in the old days of sailing ships, sea-
men held Queensland so high in favour that it was a
matter of great difficulty for shipmasters to keep their
crews from making off “up country,” and desertion
seems to have been as common when the ships anchored


in tlie bay as when they were brought with much labour
up the river. Punishment in gaol, necessitating the
sailing of his ship without him, was just what “Jack”
of the old “mainsail haul” days sought, but the hulk
anchored at the mouth of the river, and in charge of the
water-police, provided the corrective gaol did not supply.
This method of dealing with refractory seamen was
indeed found very effective, the main ingredient in the
remedial measure being that there was durance vile for
the sailor, and yet no loss of a topsail hand for the ship’s
captain.
From the hulk it may not be deemed an over-sudden
change to turn to St. Helena. Instituted in 1867, we
do not know that the penal establishment on a pretty
green islet in Moreton Bay merited the appreciative
praise it received from some people in the old days, for
really the fact that excellent sugar was grown by means
of convict labour did not make the place anything but
what it was—like the hulk for seamen —a necessary evil.
Thirty acres of land was under cane at St. Helena in the
seventies, and very good sugar and molasses were manu-
factured. In addition to cane cultivation an excellent
system indeed was adopted, that of training prisoners
in various avocations likely to be of service to them in
bread-winning when they returned to the mainland.
Turning to an important index of national character
and strength we find very satisfactory progress was
made in the period under review in regard to the subject
of education. In 1869 the number of schools, under the
national system and otherwise, represented a total of
192, the scholars numbering 13,472. In 1874 there
were 226 schools in the Colony, the number of pupils
being 26,117. In the former year there were eleven
schools of arts, the volumes in the libraries totalling
15,964. Five years later there were sixteen or more
institutions and free libraries, the total number of
volumes having increased to 24,000.
A very pleasing trait of national life in Queensland
is demonstrated in the kindly and generous assistance
given to those bending under the pressure of
sickness or adversity. In 1869 the number of
hospitals had increased to thirteen, Brisbane still holding
first place, for the metropolitan institution always was
considered in those days the base hospital for the whole
Colony. Roma was then the most westerly town in
which a hospital was found, while Townsville was the
point farthest north to which the system had extended.
In all there were more than 2,000 indoor patients treated
as medical and surgical cases during the year, while a
much larger number of patients received outdoor
treatment. There is perhaps no phase of national duty
in which better results have been experienced from the
generous co-operation of the Legislature with the public
in voluntary donations and subscriptions than is
exemplified in the system of hospital administration with
local control, as we have had it in Queensland. Yet
another institution calls for mention and also for warm
approval. For among the kindly works of the com-
munity none stands before Dunwich Benevolent Asylum,
where the old pioneers, whose labours for the general
weal were never chronicled, find a pleasant home. Those
who chose Stradbroke Island as the site where the old
folk might be cared for deserved well of their fellows,
for it would be difficult to find anywhere a more
healthful home or one with more picturesque surround-
ings. It is to be hoped that no purely utilitarian
question of expense will ever have power to remove
the benevolent asylum to the mainland, where the cir-
cumstances of the case and the necessity would infer
the substitution of a barrack system which could never
be so healthful, and certainly never so free and
untrammelled as the pretty little settlement nestling on
the slopes of Stradbroke. Well arranged and well
administered, the home for the old people has expanded
with the growth of the country. It is wholly supported
by the State, and is a credit to Queensland. In 1869
there were in all 129 inmates, among whom were men
whose experiences in all phases of colonial life, but
especially in pioneering work, were of the keenest
interest to the student of history and the observer of
mankind.
In 1869 there were yet other institutions careful of
those who required aid, for there were two homes for
children who, through the death of father or mother or
both parents, or yet other sufficient reason, were in need
of a helping hand at the age when aid is necessary.
Of the two asylums for children one, the Diamantina
Orphanage, under Protestant supervision, was in Bris-
bane ; while the other, in Roman Catholic care, was
at Nudgee, near Sandgate. Both asylums were subsidized
by the State, the sum of £5,000 being placed for the
purpose on the Estimates for 1871. In the Brisbane
institution there were 273 inmates, while the children
at Nudgee numbered 154. A year or two later yet
another asylum was instituted at Rockhampton, Parlia-
ment having voted £I,OOO towards its establishment.
Pictures of Queensland would be very incomplete
were some effort not made to visualize for the reader the
importance of the pastoral industry. In legislative
references to the occupation of the country one often
meets the phrase “settled and unsettled districts,” and
it may be well to point out that the Land Act of 1868
divided the Colony into seventeen principal districts,
seven of which were termed “settled,” while ten came
under the category of “unsettled.” The settled districts
included all the country on the southern boundary of
the Colony, extending from Point Danger on the sea-
board to the South Australian border. Those districts


varied as to their western bounds according to the
nature of the country, the fact that the dividing line
followed the ranges bringing the westerly boundary of
Port Curtis within twelve miles of the coast at one
point, while the settled portion of Darling Downs was
west of Dalby. The term “settled” inferred the pos-
sibility of agricultural settlement at the time the
limitations of the districts were decided. On the other
hand, “unsettled” conveyed the information that the
districts so named were purely pastoral.
In the seven settled districts the aggregate
number of station properties was 296. The Moreton
district was subdivided into East and West
Moreton. The former comprised the coastal counties,
while the latter extended from the western bounds of
the eastern subdivision to the main range, and included
Here there were some of the finest pastoral properties in
the Colony, there being thirty-eight runs in the district.
Returning to the coastal country, we find that there
were in the settled districts of Wide Bay and Burnett
sixty-seven runs on which cattle were depastured. As
in the case of Moreton, the runs were in the majority of
cases not of a large size. The growing town of Mary-
borough was the centre of trade.
Northward of Wide Bay and Burnett settled districts
lay Port Curtis, extending from the watershed—on one
side of which was the Kolan River, and on the other
Baffle Creek—away northwards to Cap© Palmerston.
It included the towns of Gladstone and Rockhampton,
for it had within its bounds the electorates of the latter
centre and Port Curtis. In all there were eighty-four
station properties, for the most part depasturing cattle.

the Lockyer and Gatton country, as highly prized for
pastoral purposes as it has since been valued for agri-
cultural settlement. In Moreton as a whole there were
in 1869 fifty runs, for the most part devoted to cattle-
raising, and by reason of the fact that it was the most
thickly populated district in the Colony, many of the
stations were small in extent.
The settled district of Darling Downs lay to the
west of Moreton, extending southward to the border,
having on the west the unsettled Darling Downs dis-
trict. Toowoomba and Aubigny, with the original
settlement of Drayton on the east, and other townships
marked the points around which prosperous agricultural
settlement had sprung up and was extending rapidly,
while to the west was Dalby, and southward lay other
centres of agriculture at Warwick, Allora, and Leyburn.
Northward of Port Curtis settled district extended
that of Kennedy, having within its bounds the important
towns of Mackay, Bowen, and Townsville, while beyond,
at Rockingham Bay, was Cardwell. In all there were
forty-six runs in the district.
It is interesting to note that the most northerly
settled district in the Colony, Cook and North Cook,
had at that time no pastoral settlement, although it was
destined ere many years to receive a strong stimulus in
progress through its goldfields. Somerset, which after-
wards gave place to Thursday Island, was at the time
of which we write the only centre of population in all
the Peninsular country, being really only a station of
the water-police. It was maintained by the Government
of the Colony, and by a touch of sardonic humour on the
part of the authorities was constituted a free port.


Subsequently Mr. Frank Jardiue, whose energy and
success as an explorer will be long remembered in the
North, established a cattle station at Cape Somerset.
To the westward, and still in the Gulf country,
there was the settled district of Burke, which had for
one boundary the eastern shore of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, and extended to the Northern Territory
border on the west. There were in all nine stations
within this district.
Turning to the purely pastoral country —that in the
unsettled district—we find the unsettled Darling Downs,
which marched with the western boundary of the settled
district of the same name until the border was reached.
The south-westerly boundary was placed at the southern
border, sixty miles westward of Goondiwiudi. From that
point the westerly boundary ran northward to a point
fifty miles to the north of Condamine. From the town-
ship it followed the ranges until the Darling Downs
settled district was reached, north-west of Dalby. There
were 155 runs in the district.
Gayndah was an important town in the old days,
being the centre of population and business for the
unsettled district of Burnett, which lay between the
settled district of Wide Bay and Burnett, which was to
the east, and the unsettled districts of Darling Downs
and Leichhardt. The runs in the district totalled 184.
Eoma was the chief centre of the unsettled district
of Maranoa, which had for its southern boundary the
New South Wales border, while Darling Downs and
Leichhardt formed the boundary on the east, north-east,
and north, the Warrego district being on the west. In
addition to Roma, the well-known centres of St. George
and Surat were in this district, which stood only second
to Leichhardt in the number of pastoral properties
within its bounds, for there were 544 stations in all.
The unsettled district of Leichhardt held premier
place in the Colony in regard to the number of stations
it contained, there being no less than 585 runs, on which
were depastured in all 1,500,000 sheep. In length
from north to south the district extended 350
miles. It was bounded eastward by Port Curtis and
Burnett, northward lay the Kennedy district, while to
the west was Mitchell with the Darling Downs,
while Maranoa formed the southern boundary. The
chief towns were Clermont, Peak Downs, Taroom,
Banana and Springsure.
The unsettled district of Mitchell had for its eastern
boundary the Kennedy country, Warrego being to the
south and Gregory to the west, while the district of
Burke lay to the north. Tambo was the centre of busi-
ness, which concerned the interests of no fewer than 117
runs. The Mitchell district was 250 miles in length by
200 miles in breadth.
Westward of Maranoa, and stretching southward to
the bolder, was the unsettled district of Warrego, which
had for its northern boundary the Mitchell country,
while the Gregory district marched with it on the west.
The centre of district business life was Charleville, on
the river, whence the district takes its name. In all the
pastoral properties numbered 400, and it is of interest
to learn that in those days the supplies of the stations
were obtained from New South Wales.
Northward of Leichhardt lay the districts of North
and South Kennedy, the settled district of that name
being the eastern boundary, while Cook lay to the north,
and Burke and Mitchell marched with the districts on
the west. North Kennedy had seventy-one runs within
its bounds and South Kennedy 111 stations.
The unsettled district of Cook comprised all the
territory in the Cape York Peninsula not within the
boundary of the Cook settled district. The station pro-
perties numbered in all nineteen.
As the Leichhardt district held pride of place in
regard to the number of stations within its boundaries,
so did the unsettled district of Burke claim premier
place in regard to the area of its territory. All the
country around the Gulf of Carpentaria, and not
included in the settled district of Burke, was within the
bounds of the unsettled district in which were situated
the important gold and copper fields of Gilbert and
Cloncurry, while sixty-one stations bore witness to the
stock-bearing capabilities of the country. Burketown
and Normanton, two important centres of trade and
shipping, grew up in this district.
The last unsettled district on the list was that of
Gregory. North to south the territory, in size a
kingdom, stretched for a distance of 500 miles, while
in breadth it was 300 miles. The district marched with
the Mitchell and the Warrego on the east, while it was
bounded by Burke on the north, and the New South
Wales and South Australian borders on the south and
west, respectively. It is of keen interest to learn that
in the days of which we write (1869) the Gregory district
was as yet unsettled to a great extent, for there was
only a fringe of country, divided into twenty stations,
taken up.
In the ten unsettled districts there were, as we have
found, no less than 2,277 grazing runs, and if we add
to those the 296 stations in settled districts, we get
the imposing total of 2,573 pastoral properties, jointly
and severally grand evidence of the enterprise and stal-
wart daring of the pioneering men of Queensland, the
squatters of bygone days.
The year 1878 did not dawn very brightly. For,
according to the wont of Australia, the good times in
Queensland had been followed by lean years, and at the
time of which we write the Colony was striving to rise
after weakening trials of drought, three years of dry


seasons having tested the strength and recuperative
power of Queensland to the utmost. The financial
strain which resulted was rendered extreme by the
upheaval brought about by the failure of the City of
Glasgow Bank, the liabilities of which, totalling
£10,000,000, spread ruin in widening circles, and did
not leave Queensland unaffected. The Colony indeed
had an experience of its own in financial wrong-doing,
for frauds were discovered to have been perpetrated at
the Real Property Office in Brisbane. Serious and
criminal as the frauds were, and deserving of the
punishment the guilty person received, they were not
so extensive as to affect the Colony as a whole. Still we
can find in the fact that they did injure the credit of
Queensland a very strong proof that financial affairs
were tremulous in response to repeated blows. So serious
The great drawback to oversea trade presented by
the river made itself more and more felt in Brisbane,
until, in 1888, earnest efforts were made to
devise a scheme for systematically deepening the river
channel, and under Mr. Nisbet work was started, which
was in truth never intermitted until the object was
attained. Another enterprise undertaken during the
previous year was proving very successful. Not alto-
gether satisfactory had been the efforts of Ipswich to
lead the van in cotton cultivation, but in another
direction that city was contributing materially to the
expansion of the Colony’s manufactures, for the woollen
factory had proved a great success.
It is noteworthy that the National Associa-
tion had won so great respect since its inception
in 1875 that the success of the Exhibition in 1878 was
SHOWING ORIGINAL ST. STEPHEN'S CATHEDRAL, OLD GAOL, AND NORMAL SCHOOL IN COURSE OF ERECTION IN THE EARLY SIXTIES.
was the criminal action deemed that a Royal Commission
was appointed to inquire into all the facts. With the
passing of the drought seasons and the answering gleam
of sunshine on the pastoral industry there came the
problem always calling for solution in those days, the
finding of a market for surplus stock. A step towards
the solving of the difficulty was taken in August, 1878,
when a meeting was held in the office of Messrs. B. D.
Morehead & Co., of Brisbane, to consider action in
regard to the exportation of frozen meat, and a pro-
visional committee was appointed to make arrangements.
That was the beginning of the export meat trade as we
have it to-day. In one very important particular in
national well-being, that of a market for surplus pro-
duction, the point that always emerged with favouring
seasons, there promised to be an outlet.
taken as an excellent reason for believing that the hard
times of the drought years were not to have power to
seriously injure or even retard the progress of the
Colony. It is of interest to note that the takings at the
gates of the Exhibition in the year with which we are
dealing totalled during the four days £1,579, the
receipts in all being £2,799. Rifle competitions were a
feature of show week and there was a brass-band
contest, which was won by the Toowoomba vol-
unteers. It may be of interest to recall the fact that
the Governor, Sir Arthur Kennedy, was President of the
Association, the Vice-Presidents being Messrs. A. H.
Palmer, ,1. P. Bell, J. R. Dickson, M. Miller, M.L.A.,
E. R. Drury, John Fenwick, D. McConnell, George
Raff, C. S. Mein, M.L.C., Gresley Lukin, Alex. Raff,
and Amos Radcliffe. The Council comprised Messrs.


H. L. Abbott, F. Beattie, Thomas Finney, C. H. Green,
George Grimes, L. R. Gordon, John Hardgrave, S.
Grimley, W. Kellett, M.L.A., John Little, James H.
McConnell, Angus Mackay, M.L.A., John McLennan,
W. E. Murphy, H. H. Payne, W. Pettigrew, M.L.C.,
J. Hamilton Scott, R. R. Smellie, J. H. Wheelwright,
Thomas E. White, R. D. Neilson, C. F. Gerler, and H.
Bramston. The Secretary was Mr. G. E. Layton.
Turning to the question of sport, we find that in
1878 the Queensland Cricket Association, which had been
established two years previously, was pursuing a
prosperous and successful career. In all there were six
clubs represented, two being of Toowoomba and one of
Warwick. The Commercial Rowing Club, which had
been instituted the previous year, was becoming very
popular.
As a finger-mark of progress, it is of interest to
note the prices paid for the leasing of the various ferries
in Brisbane for the ensuing year. The amounts received
were as follow; —Edward Street, £4lO, compared with
£260 in 1877; Kangaroo Point, £260, compared with
£llO the previous year; Alice Street, £215, compared
with £l5O in 1877. As another index of business and
commercial vigour it may be noted that the Queensland
National Bank declared a dividend of 10 per cent.,
while the A.S.N. Company’s dividend was at the rate
of 8 per cent. Not unworthy of notice is the fact that
during the year Ipswich was for the first time lighted
with gas, while the Brisbane Gas Company increased
its capital to £40,000. If one sought reason for
believing that the Colony had reached in 1878 a stage of
prosperity which no adverse circumstances could seriously
affect, it could be found in the position of the Govern-
ment Savings Bank in that year, for the aggregate
deposits were £702,312, while the number of the
depositors was 14,383, the population of the Colony being
at the time 200,000. The average amount of the
deposits was £SO.
We have referred to the part the School of Arts,
with its very excellent library, played in ministering to
the literary and social needs of the community in the
early days of the Colony. The old reading-room and
library were splendidly appointed and deservedly
appreciated, the former being very comfortable and well
provided with papers and periodicals. For the visitors
from the bush there was always an attraction in the cosy
reading-room. Admirably chosen were the works in
the library, and indeed so fully were the privileges of
membership availed of that it was found necessary to
seek enlarged premises. These were found in Ann
Street and officially opened on May 27, 1878, the insti-
tution still flourishing there.
During 1878 Queen Street began to assume some-
what of the appearance with which citizens of these days
are familiar, and during the next decade many of the
fine buildings, which would adorn any capital city, were
either in place or in course of erection, among them
being the Treasury building.
During the first nine months of the year immigra-
tion went on briskly, fifteen ships in all bringing
out 4,502 adults. There was an impression in
some quarters that the time had arrived when free
immigration should cease, and a movement for the
stoppage of that form of colonization began. It
is significant that while public opinion seemed disposed
to cry “Hold, enough,” to immigration from Europe
the influx of Polynesians continued. Not without pro-
test, we may be assured, for the South Sea Islander had
ere this become very unpopular indeed.
Let us paint another picture of the Colony a few
years later. In 1883 drought had again fallen on
the country, and it is perhaps of value that seasons other
t han those of exceptional prosperity should be chosen
for examination, for if there be marked advancement
under the w'hip of drought or flood, then we may rest
assured that the good years provided for themselves.
And, indeed, despite the severe losses squatters and
agriculturists sustained in some parts of Queensland by
the dry weather, which had been almost general, there
was buoyant rebound of the national life against ad-
versity. It is interesting to recall the influence exerted
by the discovery of the vast stores of subterranean water
supplies which Mother Nature, as sternly practical as
generous, had provided, not as a sop to indolence, but as
the reward of well-directed energy and labour. For the
artesian bores, already successful beyond the most san-
guine expectations as far as they had been sunk, under
conditions which promised the finding of water, were
looked to as the means—in combination with the conser-
vation of water in suitable areas—whereby the fear of
drought might be altogether eliminated. That hope,
which found wide expression throughout Australia in
the year of which we write, was not realized. It has not
yet been realized, but none the less the efforts have been
good and full of result, and looking around at the many
irrigation schemes, which have materialized, and the
manner in which deep-boring on a host of station
properties has minimized the evil of drought, one cannot
but feel that the pressing to the goal had been greatly
beneficial. In the words of the old Scottish proverb,
“Those who seek a golden gown will win a sleeve of it.”
The cereal crops were not over plentiful, neither were
root crops, and yet the Colony prospered amazingly, for
capital flowed in from the Southern Colonies, and also
from the United Kingdom. The sugar crop was large,
so much so that 16,435 tons were exported to the South.
A strong hint of the instability of the kanaka recruiting
traffic is afforded by the introduction of fifteen Cingalese


coolies for use at Mourilyan Sugar Plantation, in the
North.
Among subjects of interest which occurred during
the year was the sale of The Observer, which was then
published as a semi-official organ, under the editorship
of the late William Coote, and which had previously
passed through a somewhat chequered career. The paper
was purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company.
Mr. Coote, as has been said in another portion of
this work, did excellent service for the Colony in his
■'History of Queensland,” the first volume of which was
alone given to the public, death cutting short a pains-
taking and valuable record of Queensland’s progress.
Mr. Coote will also be remembered as a very enthusiastic
supporter of the movement for the separation of Northern
Queensland. A sign of progress in the onward march
of Brisbane was given in the launching of the first steam
ferry-boat that was used on the river, and no small
is proved by the fact on record that no less than
three vessels of the British India Company’s fleet were
to be seen berthed at one time at the wharves, and a
further very satisfactory sign of development was to be
found in the complaint that the berthing accommodation
was very inadequate. During that year the step forward
in the placing of larger steamers on the coastal trade
became very noticeable as far as Queensland was.con-
cerned, for the A.S.N. Company and the Howard
Smith Proprietary were then building larger and better-
equipped vessels than had previously been seen in
Brisbane waters, while the Queensland Steamship Com-
pany, in the “Warrego” and “Maranoa,” had coastal
liners of which much was thought in those days. The
rivalry, that of a consequence existed, benefited the
public, and was more agreeable to passengers than it
could have been to the steamship owners, for the result
was a substantial reduction of fares. Ultimately the

excitement was aroused by the arrival of Sir Anthony
Musgrave, the new Governor, who, with Lady Mus-
grave, made an official progress through the streets of
the city on November 6. A month later the Colony was
honoured by a visit from the late Earl of Rosebery,
whose influence as a member of several Imperial Ad-
ministrations and also as Prime Minister was great.
Lord Rosebery was perhaps the first Imperial Statesman
to recognize the advantage that must accrue from
personal acquaintance with the conditions of life in
Greater Britain and the benefit derived by those en
trusted with the guidance of the Empire from having
seen the Colonies and noting their requirements and
aspirations.
That the effort to facilitate the passage of the larger
steamships to the Town Reach was in a measure sucessful
unwonted generosity came to an end in the absorption
of the Queensland Company in that of the larger
proprietary, the name of which henceforth became the
Australasian United Steam Navigation Company.
In those days Queensland, and indeed Australia as
a whole, was deemed far outside the influences of war
or its terrors, but through the prudent forethought of its
rulers General Scratchley arrived in Brisbane for the pur-
pose of advising the Colonial authorities concerning the
defences of the city and the port. There was no con-
sciousness among those of the Island Continent that a
time would come when Australians would find themselves
numbered among the best soldiers in the world, or that
the fighting material of their land, with that of other
dominions overseas, would do so much to federate
the Empire by their deeds of valour.


CHAPTER XXVI.
THE COLONY’S SILVER JUBILEE.
The Colony celebrated its Silver Jubilee in 1884 by
showing to the world what energy and enterprise, armed
by daring and guided by prudence and wisdom, could
accomplish, and did we seek a monument in honour of
the pioneers, those who went out with flocks or herds,
in the footsteps of the heroes of exploration, we could
find it in no better form, nor would they desire any
other, than in following the terse panegyric on Wren
traced on the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral, away at
the heart of the Empire, for all around is the triumph
of achievement. In the millions of stock depastured on
runs, rivalling in size many a principality in the Old
World; in the long stretches of land won by the plough
for the uses of man; in the waving cane-fields, and the
cities and towns, populous and prosperous; in a happy
and satisfied people, enjoying a climate unsurpassed in
the world; in railways linking vast distances; in an
extended telegraphic system —what better monument
could those wish who saw the beginnings of them all,
and made them, than that on which the observer
looked in 1884, and, thinking of all that had
gone to the making of so great a prosperity, mur-
mured, “Stout hearts and true.” Queenslanders had
done well indeed! There is no better aid in
grasping how and why the flower of Australia—her
patriotic soldiers—have won the admiration of the world
in the battle zones of Europe, Africa, and Asia, in the
navy, and in the air, than by realizing that, as
the pioneer worthies were, so have their soldier sons
been. When we think of what the Colony was when
the painter was cut which towed the settlement behind
New South Wales, and compare it with what a quarter
of a century accomplished, that which had become fact,
seems at first glance the wildest romance. There is,
however, little savour of romance in statistics, and these
speak in tone imperative that will not bear denial. All
the more wonderful were the results on which Australia,
with Queensland’s sons and daughters, gazed, just
because the path onward had often been interrupted
and progress rendered difficult.
Statistics, indeed, spoke in the year of Silver
Jubilee as they had been speaking all the time pre-
viously. We have stated in the preceding chapter that
in 1869 the runs totalled 2,573, based on a calculation
of the number in the various settled and unsettled
districts, and in 1884 the number had increased to no
less than 9,542, the total area of the stations being
316,113,760 acres, while the annual rentals aggregated
£254,874. In all there were 253,116 horses, as com-
pared with 99,245 in 1873, while the number of cattle,
which was 1,343,093 in the latter period, had risen to
4,266,172 in eleven years. The returns in regard to
sheep in 1884 placed the total number at 9,308,911,
which was an increase of 2,039,965 as compared with the
number in 1873, but far less than would have been the
case but for the visitation of a severe drought. The
number of pigs in 1884 showed an increase of 8,912 in
eleven years, being at the end of that period 51,796.
Success waited on sugar-growing, for in 1883-4 the
manufactured products of 152 mills totalled 36,148 tons
of sugar and 1,071,413 gallons of molasses, representing
a value of nearly £1,000,000 sterling. A year later the
acreage had increased from 25,792 to 29,951, while the
number of mills in the Colony had risen to 170. In 1884
the number of distilleries in the Colony producing rum
totalled eight, there being in all 1,337,683 gallons made.
It is to be noted that the distilleries by no means kept
pace with the rapidly increasing number of sugar works,
that being probably due to the improvement in the
machinery used for manufacturing sugar and the ex-
panding demand for molasses, once almost a waste
by-product of the mill. Both facts left less of the main
factors in rum distillation, refuse and molasses.
A notable testimony to the potentialities of the
Darling Downs in regard to wheat-growing was given
O O o o o
by the fact that in 1884 there was an increase of
150,000 bushels. Compared with the preceding year,
the crop represented 195,900 bushels, as against 42,000
bushels in 1883. Of the total amount, all except 29,827
bushels were grown in the Warwick and Allora districts.
Maize, in all the districts, other than those in which
sugar-cane ruled supreme, still held first place in the
favour of the selector, and in 1884 more than 1,312,000
bushels were produced, while on the Darling Downs and
Lockyer districts oaten and wheaten hay, together with
lucerne, were produced in large quantities. The last-
named crop was found to be specially suited to the
remarkably rich land in the Laidley Valley, crop after
crop during a year being taken off the farms. It may
be stated that, owing to the fluctuation in prices due
to times of drought, the profits from this fodder crop
varied to an extent that almost introduced the element
of gambling; but it was just there that the farmers
of the Laidley Valley scored success, for, owing to the
prevalence of very heavy dews in that district, the dry
season, which pressed harshly on the growers of lucerne
elsewhere, was the richest harvest for the Laidley farmer,
very high returns, and many of them during the year,
being experienced. An old resident of the district, now
passed away (Mr. I). S. Cooper), attributed the great
success and prosperity he had achieved to the fortuitous
dews in the valley. And it is an undoubted fact that


oftentimes, when the farmers on the Downs were per-
turbed at the gloomy outlook of a "dry spell,” the
growers of agricultural produce in the Laidley Valley
smiled genially on the world at large. Bananas, as one
of the great fruit industries of Queensland, had not, at
the coming of the Silver Jubilee, reached the stage of
development the crops subsequently attained. The best
fruit then, as now, came from Cairns; but the grower
of bananas in the neighbourhood of Brisbane had advan-
tages in access to market which were denied the man on
the tropical seaboard. And many a modest fortune
deservedly won by thrift and industry was due in the
main to the growing of bananas in the Brisbane district,
the farmer carrying out his own transport service, and
so performing it efficiently. The market for bananas
was then wholly local —confined to Queensland. Not
yet had come the days when Melbourne and Sydney
realized the value of this fruit. Not yet had come the
for the steamship proprietary, then the A.S.N. Com-
pany, to forbid the officers of the vessels from speculating
in consignments of bananas on their own account. All
this was in the days long before Federation became a
fact, and we mention it to show that the trade, which
should have given place to- that with Queensland,
was brisk and prosperous when the Moreton banana
man brought a waggon load of fair fruit to the market.
A retrospect from the vantage ground of the
twenty-fifth year of the Colony’s life would be incomplete
without a glance at the development of local govern-
ment affairs. Following the granting of civic autonomy
to the chief centres of population, of which there has
been something said, it is of interest, as well as of im-
portance, that some thought should be devoted to
another phase of local government —that in the country
districts. The divisional system was, indeed, the twin
brother of municipal administration. Self-government

days when Federation would open the markets of the
South to the banana planter; and not yet, it may be
added, was the banana industry of Queensland threat-
ened and dominated by interests in Fiji. Seemingly the
principle of a White Australia, and the consequent
preference for products not tainted with the touch of an
alien coloured hand, did not apply to the Fiji banana
trade. In the early days a bunch of bananas could be
bought in Fiji for a shilling, the bunch being 6 ft. in
length, and if the weather were propitious the price paid
in Sydney for a dozen of bananas almost equalled that
which the entire bunch cost the Fiji shipper. There
was, of course, the element of risk, for in the event of
stormy weather the hatches, kept off for the sake of the
fruit, were battened down, and in that case the shipment
tailed. The element of speculation probably lent fas-
cination to the venture, for it was stated that owing to
the protests of growers in Fiji it was found necessary
for the man on the land as well as the citizen of the
town had long been in the air in Australia, and follow-
ing the lead given by the South, especially in Victoria,-
the Mcllwraith Administration in 1879 introduced the
Divisional Boards Act, which gave to the rural settlers
a local parliament, and as a result quickened the interest
taken in the various districts, of which there were
seventy-three constituted. Under the system, work in
connection with the construction of new roads and
bridges, and the necessary repairs to those already in
existence, went on apace, and altogether the great step
in local government did perhaps more to promote settle-
ment than any other factor with the exception
of railway extension. Linked with the divisional
system of local government there was the Local
Works Loan Act, which made provision for the advance
of money on loan for local works, the principle adopted
being a very wise one, the term for repayment being


lengthened in proportion as the work was of a permanent
character. Thus for the most durable works the term
of repayment was forty years, interest being payable
to the Treasury at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum,
with redemption at the rate of 16s. Bd. The principle
of the latter Act was subsequently extended to the sugar
industry, and formed the basis of the Sugar Works
Guarantee Act, which enables mills to be erected in
various districts under advances from the Treasury.
Turning to a subject—immigration —which was con-
sidered all-important in the days of which we write,
we find that the movement to reduce the number of
immigrants to 10,000 per annum could not have been
successful in 1884, as the number of persons who arrived
from overseas totalled 16,486. In comparing the arrivals
with the departures in that year, we find that they were
36,883 and 18,263, respectively, the excess of arrivals
over departures being 18,620. That represented the
highest tide of inflow in settlers since the constitution
of the Colony. During the year, as a result of the
voyaging of thirty-one vessels among the island-groups
of the Western Pacific, 1,910 kanakas in all were
brought to Queensland for use on sugar plantations.
The extension of the railway system was proceeding
at a rate commensurate with the general advancement
of the Colony, and at the end of the year the lines
opened for traffic represented in all 1,207 miles, while
there were nearly 800 miles in course of construction.
The mileage of railways in the three divisions was as
follows:—Southern, 701; Central, 335; Northern, 171.
While it is true in the main that railways must follow
population, it can without doubt be also affirmed with
equal proof that settlement follows railways, and on that
reasoning one might wonder that the mileage was so
markedly greater in the Southern Division as compared
with the Central and Northern Districts. To that
criticism the rejoinder would probably have been made
in those days, as it served four or five years later, when
Mr. Mathieson assumed control of railway affairs as
Commissioner, and eluded fervent appeals for branch
lines by reminding the anxious inquirers that “railways
must be run on business principles.” It may not be out
of place to mention at this point that in the following
year the Cooktown railway was opened for a distance of
thirty miles, as was also the Mackay line to Hamilton
with the branch to Eton.
Nothing bears stronger witness to the rapidly
evolving prosperity of the Colony than the effective
manner in which the mail service overseas was carried
out, no less than six steamers per month leaving for
Europe. Of the great bulk of mails, the Torres Strait
service was the carrier, and undoubtedly the British
India Steam Navigation Company, both in the convey-
ance of passengers and cargo, did much to advance the
Colony and make its possibilities known to the world.
Apart altogether from the vexed relation of one par-
ticular contract to personal interests and personal aims,
the system as a whole was an unmixed good, for the
service was of and for Queensland.
The national school system of the Colony in the
twenty-fifth year of its life had definitely assumed the
form which it now bears, and which has certainly proved
itself most efficient, for though there may be, and
probably always will be, great differences of opinion on
the subject of scholastic teaching which is secular as
well as compulsory and free, it cannot be denied that in
Queensland schools and the manner of their adminis-
tration the system has worked splendidly. The old
question of endowment, then as now, came up occasion-
ally as a grievance, but the subject of dispute was prac-
tically solved as time went on through the institution of
the Brisbane Sunday - school Union among Churches
other than the Anglican and Roman communions; by
the institution of denominational secondary schools by
Churches; and also by clergymen taking advantage of
the opportunity offered in the State school system to
impart religious training to the youth of their congrega-
tions in hours preceding or following the regular school
curriculum. In 1884 there were 263 State schools and
160 provisional schools in Queensland, the annual enrol-
ment being 52,536, while the teachers on the staff
totalled 1,152. The cost of education was £177,489 for
the year, the primary schools absorbing £150,160 of that
amount.
In all there were five grammar schools—at Bris-
bane, Ipswich, Toowoomba, Maryborough, and
Rockhampton—the institution at Townsville not yet
having taken form. These schools received State aid,
and were largely availed of by many of the bright young
people in the primary schools, for during the year fifty-
two pupils of primary schools were successful in
obtaining scholarships. In addition to the ordinary
system of education, it is of interest to know that there
were in those days six institutions to which was relegated
the important duty of caring for neglected children,
who were all under Government inspection. The
State did excellent work in that direction, for the
number of children so guided into the path leading to
worthy womanhood and manhood was 1,136, there being
at the time thirteen children who were placed under the
care of the New South Wales Blind, Deaf and Dumb
Institution, the Queensland Government bearing the cost
of their education, for the institution in Brisbane had
not been initiated.
It is needless to state that, as it was with education,
so it was with the Churches. No denomination was
recognized as of the State, and yet a memory remained
of what had been, away back in pre-separation days,
for there were at the time of which we write two clergy-
men who continued to receive stipends from the State,


the arrangement being for life. The sole relation of
the Government to the Churches was in the matter of
marriages, and that really rested in the ultimate with
the religious bodies themselves, for the ministers
authorized to celebrate marriages were chosen by
the denominations according to the systems under
which they worked, the State accepting the recommend-
ations of the Churches on the subject. Inclusive of
Hebrews, there were in all 250 clergymen in the Colonv
at the time of which we write, or one to every 1,250 of
the population. This, however, hardly gives a just idea
of the number of teachers of religion in the Colony, as
several of the Churches availed themselves largely of
the aid of lay ministers, who were not authorized to
celebrate marriages, and these were not included in
the list from which we have quoted.
For many years there had been effort after effort
to minister to the wants—religious, social, and educa-
During the year 1884 the imports showed an increase
of £500,000 compared with the preceding annual
period, being £6,381,976, which in turn was more than
double the value of the imports in 1880, which were
£2,841,645. The total value of the exports, which were
in the main pastoral products—wool being the chief
item—and included gold and sugar, amounted in all
to £4,673,874, compared with £3,216,999 in 1880. In
the year under review there were nine banks doing busi-
ness in the Colony as compared with the four in operation
when separation took place. The Royal Bank of Queens-
land had but lately been established, the capital, as the
name indicated, being chiefly subscribed in the Colony.
The total deposits were £6,322,025, as compared with
£5,610,051 in 1882. The note circulation in 1884 was
£633,083, compared with £525,726 two years previously.
The liabilities of the Banks in 1884 totalled over
£7,500,000, the assets being £9,750,000. During

tional—of the aborigines, for generous minds had ever
concerned themselves with the problems of a disappear-
ance of savage races. The question aroused the deep
interest of one of the most energetic champions
Queensland ever had, for Dr. Lang, whose death at a
very advanced age had taken place in 1878, had done
much in furtherance of missions to the aborigines, yet
the efforts were not successful—were indeed acknow-
ledged in 1884 to have been akin to failure, one Church
showing as poor results as another. Within the last
decade or two, however, a change has taken place, and
whether it be due to the adoption of different methods,
there cannot be a doubt but that the care and education
of the blacks, who should be really considered the wards
of the State, has been attended by far more hopeful
results, the proof of success being found in the inaugur-
ation of new mission stations and the training of young
aborigines in self-help,
the year the Commercial Banking Company of
Sydney declared a dividend of 25 per cent.,
while the New South Wales Bank declared one
of 17 per cent. In the Savings Bank the number
of depositors was 33,067, the total deposits being in
value £1,220,614, an increase of £60,000 as compared
with 1883. During the year the number of depositors
had increased by no less than 4,000 persons. Turning
to the goldfields, we find that the total amount of the
precious metal mined, from the discovery of gold until
the conclusion of the twenty-fifth year of the Colony’s
existence, was 4,529,280 oz., of a value of £15,852,480.
There was an increase of 95,021 oz. compared with the
yield in the preceding year. It is of interest to learn
that in the following year the Government decided to
assist deep-sinking by means of loans on the goldfields,
and also that Schools of Mines should bo established
at Gympie, Charters Towers, and Herberton.


The mid-eighties saw the first pronounced and
definitely official action by the German Government in
pursuance of the plan for domination in the Pacific, of
which Australasia was destined to hear so much in the
Great War. On December 18 rumours of German action
in annexation at New Guinea were heard at Cooktown,
which was at that time the chief trading port with
Papua. The news proved only too true, and six months
later Kaiser Wilhelm granted a charter to a German
Colonization Company in connection with the territories
taken possession of, and of which Admiral Werner was
appointed the Governor, in July, 1885. In February of
that year Mr. A. R. H. Pietzcher was appointed Agent
for the Queensland Government to promote German
immigration to the Colony, and it is also of interest, in
the light of later events and of German action that
was being taken, to remember that on April 1, 1885,
the German residents of Brisbane still retained so closely
the ties binding them to their native country as to send
their congratulations to Prince Bismarck on his attain-
ing his seventieth birthday. The “man of blood and
iron,” as his countrymen were wont to call Bismarck,
did not seem to appreciate the compliment very much,
for we learn that later in the year he opposed emigra-
tion from Germany to Queensland, probably desiring that
the tide should flow into the countries over which flew
the Kaiser’s flag. Germany, indeed, was in no wise
content with the territory she had gained in New
Guinea, for later in the year there came the tidings
that the Kaiser’s warships had seized the Caroline
Islands, which lie east of the Phillipines and directly
north of New Britain and New Ireland, which became
part of German New Guinea. The Caroline group
belonged to Spain, where great excitement was aroused
by the action of Germany, who retained the purloined
Colony, notwithstanding the fact that Pope Leo offered
to mediate on the much-vexed question between the two
countries, and as the result of his arbitration found that
the Carolines rightfully belonged to Spain. Germany
did not loosen her grip, and Spain ultimately lost the
group. In other directions Germany was at the time
widening her interests in the Pacific, working through
trade with the various islands in the west, all of which,
if necessary, could be converted into bases for attacking
New Zealand and Australia. The heavily subsidised
German trading company operating from Samoa, and
the constitution of Hamburg as the centre of the copra
tra"tle of the world —permitted, it must be confessed,
through the apathy of Britain—all were parts of the
scheme for world domination, one of the main features
in the programme being undoubtedly an attack on Aus-
tralasia. We have stated that in those days the Queens-
land Government evinced a strong desire to direct Ger-
man immigration to the Colony. It is to be hoped the
subjects of the Kaiser did not act, as some prospective
colonists from the United Kingdom did, when
they used Queensland as a changing station on a journey
to the Southern settlements. The immigration statistics
seemed to show that there must have been a very con-
siderable leakage, as, indeed, was proved by the necessity
which had arisen to make it an offence punishable by
law for an immigrant to leave the Colony until he had
resided three months in Queensland. In the month of
February, 1885, a new arrival was brought to trial for
a contravention of the law in attempting to make his
way south before the prescribed time. Where one was
caught, however, very many escaped across the boundary
line scot-free, despite the vigilance of the Border Patrol
and the police on watch at the wharves.
An event worthy of being chronicled occurred in the
departure of Bishop Hale, who with his family left
Queensland for the south in March en route for Eng-
land. On reaching Sydney the aged prelate sent in his
resignation to the Archbishop, thus terminating a long
and arduous service of forty years’ pastorate in Australia.
The memory of old residents holds a warm place for
the highly-respected Bishop, worthy indeed of the deep
regard and esteem in which he was held not only by
the members of the Anglican Church, but also by the
community as a whole. Bishop Hale was succeeded by
Bishop Webber, who arrived in the Colony eight months
later, and during a long episcopate expanded the
influence for the good of his Church, winning for himself
the name of a most capable administrator as well as a
devoted chief pastor.
Of very keen interest for us should be the threaten-
ing shadow of war which overhung the Empire in the
year 1885. We, as Australians, should never forget
that year, which heard the first outspoken assertion that
as the Empire was one, so was it the duty of Australians
to bear the sword abroad on behalf of the grand unity
of which we are justly proud, and which had done and
is doing so much for the freedom of the world. It has
been asserted, and we doubt not with undeniable truth,
that it was Britain’s little wars that maintained the
efficiency of the army and fostered that spirit of
patriotism which is so different from autocratic
militarism. Those little wars indeed provided training
during the years of international peace for many of
her military units in India and the Colonies. The war
in the Soudan then waging, and the struggle in
Egypt, fired the imagination of Australians and aroused
that fervour of devotion of which so great evidence was
given on two momentous occasions later. We may deem
it was the day of small things in military service when
New South Wales offered 500 men and two batteries of
artillery for Imperial service, but the Motherland read
rightly the spirit which prompted volunteers and
Government alike, and the contingent was accepted, and
left for Egypt in March, Emulous of the patriotism


displayed by the Mother Colony, Mr. \V. P. Morgan gave
a donation of £SOO to I he equipment of a Queensland
contingent, but it was afterwards decided that volunteers
from the northern Colony should serve with the New
South Wales force, who carried themselves grandly in
the desert warfare against the Arab tribesmen, their
first skirmish taking place in April, when three of
the volunteers were wounded. The first link of
Imperial defence was forged by Australian soldiers
in the Soudan. Meanwhile the danger-cloud in Europe
had grown large, for Russian Imperialism, always
striving to obey the mandate in the will of Peter the
Great, was displaying a belligerent spirit on the northern
bounds of Afghanistan, with India as the objective.
of the fact that the members of the force to a man
volunteered for active service in defence of the Colony
if necessary. In the same month it was decided to form
a regiment of Scottish Rifles, while for some time a
detachment of the Permanent Force was on special ser-
vice at Lytton. Further evidence in necessary pre-
cautions against a possible enemy was afforded in the
regulation that no steamer was allowed to go up the
river until it had been examined by an officer of a naval
ship, and it may be noted in passing that the Queensland
gunboat “Paluma” arrived from the United Kingdom
in April. The war cloud was dissipated, as we said, by
diplomacy, and in August the members of the Soudan
contingent arrived in Australia from Egypt, and were
FIRST COMPLETED PORTION OF PARLIAMENT HOUSE.
The situation was grave, and although war was averted
by diplomacy, it was necessary for Britain to inform the
Russian Government that any attack on the Ameer’s
territory would be deemed an act of war. That all the
. Empire was moved by the possibility of hostilities may
be realized by noting that Queensland was arming; more
than that, the New South Wales contingent, when in
Egypt and after their first baptism of fire, volunteered
for further military service in India. Fortunately their
services were not required, but the interesting point for
the historian is that the offer was made.
In the month of May the Queensland Police Force,
always a fine body of men, was reviewed in the Govern-
ment Domain, and all Queenslanders should be proud
accorded the enthusiastic reception they deserved, the
citizens of Sydney presenting the soldiers with medals.
In January, 1885, a very important work took place
closely linked with the progress of the city, for in that
month the laying of tramways began, and on Sep-
tember 12 of the same year the trams started to run.
Two days previously, the trials being wholly successful,
an opportunity was taken to give citizens gratuitous
rides. It must, however, be confessed that the tramway
system of those days, though a great advance on the olcl-
fashioned omnibuses, up to that time the chief mode of
locomotion, was hardly equal to the well-equipped
service to which the citizens of Brisbane are now
accustomed. For then, and indeed during more than a


decade subsequently, the means of traction was horses,
an additional horse being attached to the tram-car at
steep points of the route, such as that part of Stanley
Street opposite the Dry Dock.
During the year the increasing business with
Gympie, stimulated by the construction of the
railway between Maryborough and the goldfield
in 1881, resulted in a bi-weekly coach service
between Brisbane and Gympie being initiated.
The successful tenderer was Mr. McCallum, the amount
being £1,400 per annum. The final railway link between
Brisbane and Gympie—the last section, between Cooran
and Gympie—was finished in 1889. The advancing pro-
sperity of Townsville was demonstrated by the payment
of a dividend of 10 per cent, by the Gas Company there,
while the progress of that part of Brisbane on the
southern side of the river was marked by the institution
of the South Brisbane Gas Company.
In Brisbane the transactions in landed property
showed the rapidity with which the capital was forging
ahead, and what took place there was an excellent index
of expanding business in other centres. In 1885 Mr.
L. Cusack bought three acres, the property of the Bris-
bane Gas Company, for £IOO,OOO, while the Presby-
terian Church sold to the Queensland National Bank
Company the property of the Creek Street Church for
£18,750. Two allotments in Queen Street which were
placed on the market realized £43,000, while lots in
the Milton Estate, numbering in all 169, brought
£33,512.
An offer to purchase the Town Hall for £IO,OOO
was refused. Dealing with other developments in the
city, it will be of interest to know that at the end of
the preceding year the tender of Messrs. Petrie & Sons
for the erection of the Australian Mutual Provident
Society’s building at the intersection of Queen and
Edward Streets was accepted, the contract price being
£37,500, and building operations went on in 1885.
Another notable architectural feature of Queen Street
was also begun during the year, when work was com-
menced in connection with the new Opera House, subse-
quently named His Majesty’s Theatre, the cost of the
building being £18,350. As the year was drawing to
its close great impetus was given to oversea trade by the
arrival of the steamer “Rajpootana,” the vessel which
inaugurated the direct service between Indian ports and
Brisbane established by the British India Steamship
Company, and which did much to benefit horse-breeding
in Queensland.
It is of importance in our glance at the industrial
conditions of the Colony in the mid-eighties to refer to
the fisheries, the possibilities of which are far greater
than in other parts of the Australian coast, save perhaps
the North-west, for in Queensland the great harvest
of the sea should go far beyond the ordinary meaning
of that phrase, including, as it does, pearling, the
beche-de-mer and dugong fisheries, and turtling. The
fisheries might be termed the earliest of all Queens-
land industries, for probably they alone were pur-
sued by the aborigines long before the advent of
the white man.
We have referred to the oyster fisheries of the
Colony, and the satisfactory position the industry occu-
pied through the favour expressed in the South for the
mollusc of Moreton, Wide Bay, and Port Curtis. It is
not improbable that the blow this industry received in
the ravages of the boring worm, which reduced the
exports very seriously indeed, was a blessing in disguise,
for in the efforts to extirpate the pest the fishery was
systematized, and probably became stronger and more
prosperous than if it had met no adverse conditions.
Supervision on the one hand, and the best methods of
utilizing the oyster-beds while preserving them, met with
deserved success. Of the dugong fishery we can only
hope that, as it might have been, so it will yet be, for
though there may not be “herds” on the Queensland
coast to the extent that aroused the wonder of earlier
days, there were and are great numbers of the sea
mammals on the Papuan littoral. Away to the North
were found the fisheries purely tropical, such as quest
for turtles, beche-de-mer, and pearl shell, all three being
for the most part confined to Cooktown and Thursday
Island. As far as the edible turtle was concerned, the
catches, like those of the dugong, were for the most part
accidental, the nearest coastal settlement taking the foods
the gods provided, and that being the end of the matter.
In regard to turtling in the tortoise-shell phase of the
industry, Thursday Island waters were the scene of most
of the operations. The Queensland variety of the hawks-
bill turtle yielded shell which was sold at from 20s. to
30s. per lb., and had, as we may suppose, encouraging
potentialities. The days of which we write were pro-
bably the palmy period of both the beche-de-mer fishery
and pearling, though in truth the latter term is a mis-
nomer, as the industry concerned pearl shell in the main,
and not pearls. The beche-de-mer fishery, both at
Cooktown and Ihursday Island, was a very important
factor in the industries of the Far North. The gathering
of the sea slug on the reefs was extremely profitable, for
no less than £240 per ton was paid in China for this
dainty, the excellence of which as a savoury seems to
depend, like turtle soup, more upon the skill with which
other ingredients are introduced than on any special
charms the foundation materials have in regard to tooth-
someness.
Like the quest for the less valuable if more edible
mollusc, the search for the oyster of the pearl-shell beds
has undergone an evolution, and more than that, many


vicissitudes, owing to fluctuation of prices in the English
markets. It was probably at the height of its pro-
sperity in the early years of the eighties. It is perhaps
interesting to know that away back in the seventies,
when the water police at Somerset were on guard in the
Torres Strait, the equipment for pearl-shell finding
might be on a most modest scale, and yet share the
chances of success, for at points on the coast near the
settlement it was possible to induce the aborigines to dive
by presents of gaudy trinkets and hoop-iron knives,
while the supplies of the white employer were summed
if any, for the most part reached the owners on the store
ship. As the industry went on in prosperity—and it pros-
pered amazingly for many years, being always on a larger
scale at “the island,” as Port Kennedy was termed,
than at Cooktown—the diving-dress was called into
requisition, and diminished the value of the almost fish-
like kanaka. As one pearl-shell bed after another
became exhausted the pearl-shell seeker was forced
into deeper water, and just as the water
deepened did his difficulties increase. It may be that

up in the pioneer’s piece de resistance, a bag of flour.
Things did not long remain accommodatingly primitive;
the lugger replaced the blackfellow’s canoe, and often-
times the Polynesian took the place of the aborigine.
Then came the need for going further to sea, and with
that necessity there appeared the man of money, for
there were veritable fleet-masters in those days with a
mother schooner for the luggers, sixteen or seventeen in
number. All supplies came from the schooner, and the
winnings of the sea quest were taken there, while pearls,
together with the coming of vegetable ivory into the
markets of the world, had dealt pearl-shelling a mortal
blow, or that the difficulties of deep-sea pearling could
not be overcome, or that by a combination of
the two factors the pearl-seeker could not face
the lowered price of the shells; but no matter
what effect those disabling influences had, there is no
doubt that the White Australia policy made applicable
to pearl-shelling was well-nigh the point of breaking
with prosperity.


CHAPTER XXVII.
THE MAKING OF FLOCKS AND HERDS.
Looking back from the high vantage ground
which the Colony had reached in twenty-five years,
we can see the road onward filled with flocks and
herds, and may hear in fancy the pistol-like crack of
the stockwhip and see the watchful bustling of the sheep
dog as he steadies his charges in the ascent. The story
of the making of flocks and herds in Australia touches
one with all the magic of a romance, for we must
turn to the first days of colonization to picture
the pastoral wealth of Australia, and with it that of
Queensland. Amid the confusion after the land-
ing of the first fleet, when Governor Phillip was
ordering his strangely assorted settlement, there stood
seven horses, seven cattle, and twenty-nine sheep, with
a few pigs and rabbits and poultry. That is the earliest
picture. It was the beginning, and it has an over-
powering attraction for everyone gifted with imagination,
and looking at the advance Queensland had made in the
mid-eighties, or the further marvellous progress of which
her pastoral wealth to-day speaks.
Only a year after Governor Phillip had pitched his
camp on the grassy slope leading down to the lapping
waves of Port Jackson a man turned his thoughts to
the big problem. That man was Captain Macarthur,
and the problem was the feeding of the settlement, which
he had imagination enough to see expanding and grow-
ing. Had the young officer not occupied himself with
such thoughts, merely being content to give his
leisure hours to such rude pleasures as the infant Colony
afforded, what might have chanced it is difficult to say
and vain to speculate. There was far more than the
desire for personal gain or the gratification of personal
ambition in the problem Captain Macarthur set himself
to solve, and which he did solve.
No swift passage of a luxurious steamer was the
voyage to Australia in those days. Usually it meant
weary buffeting with the waves for five, or even seven
or eight months. And ships with supplies often
failed to arrive. All that entered into the problem the
young officer was trying to solve. The sheep imported
from India, and the change and improvement noticeable
in the wool under Australian skies, were important
factors in the deductions he made. Captain Macarthur
acquired three rams, gift of the King of Spain to the
Dutch Government, and his success in that step is matter
for wonder, when we remember how jealously the
Netherlands Government opposed the advancement of
colonial enterprise other than their own. Again, in 1803,
a further stage was reached by Macarthur, then
on a visit to England, for King George 111., in his desire
to stimulate the production of fine wool, decided to sell
a portion of Iris stud of Nigretti sheep, a gift from the
King of Spain. Captain Macarthur saw his oppor-
tunity, and seized it, purchasing seven rams and one
ewe. Tt is presumed that the royal flockmaster had no
desire to render the object he aimed at more difficult of
attainment, for it is stated that the highest price the
Australian settler jiaid for a sheep was £3O. That is
the story, and when one ponders it in all its bearings
it surely rivals romance in the manner in which the
puzzle-pieces of success fitted one with the other.
As we follow the pages of Imperial administra-
tion of the infant settlement we see how much
depended on the personal idiosyncrasies of a Secretary of
State, for it was upon action by Lord Camden, who
was then in charge of the Colonial Office, that the
pendulum swinging to success or failure hinged. For-
tunately for Australia, the' Minister had the gift of
intuition above many of his fellows, before or since,
and so it came that the Governor of New South Wales
was instructed to give Macarthur enough of land to
produce food supplies for the Colony, as well as to
produce on an increasing scale that finer wool, which it
may be mentioned had already attracted the attention
of manufacturers in England, for the pioneer flock-
master had displayed great forethought in taking with
him on his visit a specimen of his wool clip. So came
Captain Macarthur’s “Camden” Estate, named in
grateful remembrance of the man who had prescience to
see as he saw. In 1807 a bale of wool from the
Macarthur flock was sold in London, realizing 10s.
6d. per lb.
The great adventure had begun in earnest six years
later, when Wentworth and other pioneers made their
way inland, crossing the Blue Mountains, with the
result that as they left the coastal regions with their
flocks so did they find the quality of the wool improve
until in 1824 it could be said with proof that practically
a new variety of wool had been evolved in the Mudgee
country. Meanwhile another Australian Colony had
become the centre of fine-wool production, for in Tas-
mania sheep-grazing and wool-growing had gone on so
extensively and successfully that the supply soon over-
ran local demands, and thus we find that in the settle-
ment of 1 ort Phillip in the late thirties Tasmanian
flockmasters played a very important part, and great
estates like “Ercildoune,” acquired by the Livingstone-
Learmonths in the Ballarat district, took form. The flocks
there, and also those in Tasmania, together with those
of New South Wales, among which Captain Macarthur’s


held first place, became increasingly valuable, until as a
result forty years later wool so excellent was produced
in the Frcildoune flocks that it was sold in the London
market for 4s. fid. per lb.
The pioneer of the great industry, Captain Mac-
arthur, died in 1834, but, as we have seen, his work
lived alter him. His widow, however, with a rare devo-
tion to her husband’s object in life, continued to follow
the course he had marked out for himself, and when in
1856 the flock of stud ewes, 1,000 in number, was sold
they enriched still further the best sheep stations of
Victoria and New South Wales. In Tasmania the flocks
were for the most part pure, but an effort was made
to raise crossbreds.
Nothing, perhaps, could
demonstrate the necessity
for firm adherence to the
object desired more than the
manner in which Captain
Macarthur withstood all
temptation, and avoided all
pitfalls in the work he had
set himself to accomplish,
for temptation there was to
turn aside from the growing
of wool to the raising of
fat stock for market, and
this is amply shown by the
fact that fat wethers were
then selling at £5 per head.
Other squatters in New
South Wales, among them
the Rev. S. Marsden, did
splendid work in regard to
sheep-raising, but the high
price of mutton caused them
to diverge from the direct
line of wool-growing. Mac-
arthur, alone of all the
early masters of flocks, made
the production of wool of
the best possible quality the
one object of all his endeavours.
Turning from the beginnings of the Australian wool
industry, which has such close relations to the advance-
ment of Queensland, we find that in the early days there
were two doors to the pastoral industry in the Moreton
Bay Settlement. While the convict system continued
one door, that on the coast, was locked. The other was
inland, not only over the main range, but away to the
south, in the Mother Colony, for the passage to free
settlement began at the Hunter River, in New South
Wales. A long and arduous journey was entailed,
blacks were numerous, and often dogged the track
ot the adventurous squatters. Thus, while there were
practically no developments in the Moreton country
until the year 1842, when the stock belonging to the
Government was sold, there was always a filtering
through of settlement from New South Wales. And
without doubt the very dangers of the route gave assur-
ance that none but the best settlers were winning
homes for themselves west of the main range. Among
the adventurous spirits in the Mother Colony who
pushed outward and northward was Allan Cunningham,
who not only discovered the Darling Downs, but rode
Thither from the coast. It has caused wonder that there
should be so long a time between Cunningham’s explor-
ation and the settlement of Patrick Leslie in the country
that is now near Warwick, but the penal station was
only administered for one
object, the detention of
convicts, and officials en-
gaged in that work were
ever prone to frown on those
who came near to what they
had begun to consider their
own domains.
Settlement in the free
days at Moreton Bay
developed as circumstances
compelled; in other words,
the principle of “the
survival of the fittest’’
operated in regard to flocks
and herds.
It may safely be said
that, no matter whether the
pioneer squatter started out
on his adventure with sheep
or cattle, the question recti-
fied itself, and in the end
the condition of the herbage
dictated what species of
stock should be grazed. For
this reason we find that all
the stations on the eastern
side of the main range
depastured cattle, while on the Downs the grasses were
more suitable for sheep, and sheep were the stock placed
there. Yet away in the extreme west the breeding of
cattle was pursued with great success, for although sheep
throve well there, and the country was not exclusively
suitable for cattle, like the coastal belt and the Gulf
lands, yet for reasons of expense it was found preferable
to raise cattle. Here the question of carriage came in
and gave a verdict in favour of cattle. Sometimes
wonder is expressed why settlement did not make pro-
gress more swiftly, for the journeys of Sir Thomas
Mitchell in the west, and Kennedy’s discovery
of the Barcoo country, had shown that the lands
JOHN MACARTHUR OF CAMDEN.


they explored were admirably adapted to pastoral
occupation. The answer to the question is given fully
and sufficiently in one word, “carriage,” supplemented
by another word, “labour.” Picture the anxieties of
the squatters when we think that the supplies for the
stations took from six to nine months to reach their
destination, the long toilsome trip of the bullock-dray
exceeding the voyage of a sailing ship from England to
Australia. The carriage in those days cost more than
the value of the goods. Can we wonder, therefore, that
the lands remained unoccupied for long, or should it
create any astonishment that the squatters as a class
used all the influence they possessed in furtherance of
trunk railway lines which would in part at least shorten
the long journey of the bullock-dray ? As we think of
the difficulties the pioneers met and overcame, we see
the vital relation of railways to pastoral settlement to an
extent perhaps never before realized. And naturally
the squatters had for their desire simply the bringing
of the lines nearer to their own doors. Every mile of
new railway constructed towards their stations made
the conditions easier, and by so doing greatly benefited
Queensland. It is thus seen that the point of view of the
squatter with regard to railways was not that of the
citizen of the; town. The citizen and the agriculturist
desired closer settlement and prosperity, but the
squatter sought to reduce those expenses which not
only excluded all the profits, but more than that,
endangered his ultimate freedom by necessitating
recourse to financial aid when the bad season came, as
come it inevitably did sooner or later. As to employes,
that difficulty simply resolved itself into the common-
sense question of whether men and women who could
obtain work in or near town would be content to go
“out-back.”
In some oases, doubtless the love of adventure
attracted men to the western country, but for the greater
number the position was summed up in the query,
“Why should we go?” If the lone land had disadvan-
tages which forbade settlement to a certain class, it
invited it from another, and for the young adventurous
spirit who had a little capital the Far West seemed the
place where he should go. And go he did, not always
succeeding, for droughts and floods had to be reckoned
with, and yet were beyond reckoning.
During the sixties settlement went on rapidly, and
it may be said that wherever facilities for water could
be found the country was taken up. Then came a
modification of the manner of carrying on pastoral busi-
ness. Stations were divided into large paddocks and
fenced, attendants were replaced by boundary riders, the
the old-time picturesque figure of the Australian
bush, the shepherd, passed away. It seems absurd to us
who live in these days to find that the same fear which
had deterred flockrnasters in New South Wales adven-
turing to the north should have been expressed in regard
to western settlement, but in truth the pioneer flock-
master was gravely told that the wool of his sheep would
turn to hair. Nothing more suitable for wool production
of the best could have been found than the lands of the
“Never-Never.” When the tide of settlement began
to flow towards the west it ever increased in volume as
time went on, until at the end of the sixties and in the
early seventies there remained no more land to be taken
up, for the legislation passed in 1869 encouraged settle-
ment greatly, giving leases for a period of twenty years
to all persons who, taking up country, stocked it to
the minimum of twenty-five sheep or five cattle per
square mile. Here and there rash men found their out-
let from some difficulty by over-stocking the country they
had taken up, and thus fell into others more serious,
for showed that safety lay not in over-
stocking, but in prudently calculating the number of
stock that could be safely depastured during an average
season.
It is not unworthy of note that just about the time
the despatch of frozen meat, and subsequently chilled
meat, to England gave assurance of practically a bound-
less market for the Australasian pastoralist, the discovery
that there were vast stores of subterranean water in the
plain lands of Australia opened out a way for develop-
ment in another direction. With the need for more
grazing land, it was given. For with the artesian bore
there were made available large tracts of country good
in every respect save one, that there was no permanent
water thereon. The problem was solved by the rivers
flowing far underneath the surface; the wisdom of
conserving water was preached, and, receiving attention,
the scoop came and, dams were made on many a station.
In the midst of the great prosperity which came to the
country with the advent of meat works, it is well to
realize that the exportation of meat could never have
been taken advantage of to the full had it not been for
the development of boring and its combination with
water conservation. It is indeed a thought to remember
that many a time in a drought-stricken season the
hungry stock trod down and spoilt the grass in the
vicinity of the waterholes, thereby rendering their own
condition as to food more precarious, while all the time
there were millions of gallons of water flowing 2,000 ft.
below. It is now confidently asserted that the artesian
water supply of Queensland is practically inexhaustible.
As time went on the occupation of the country improved
its water-bearing advantages, for it was found that as
stock were depastured so did they give facilities for a
“run-off” in the creeks, as opposed to soakage into the
ground, thereby reduced to a spongy consistency. And
experience also showed that the smaller the paddock was


the better did the stock, especially sheep, thrive. Per-
chance in that knowledge was the germ of the grazing
farm, which subsequently took form with such excellent
results.
Of the two methods of obtaining an artificial water
supply, the artesian bore system found much greater
favour as compared with conservation, supplies of
water up to 3,000,000 gallons per diem being
obtained at an average depth of 1,600 ft. Con-
servation did not proceed so rapidly, although it was
known that in many parts of the Colony the configuration
of the country lent itself to the system admirably, as
was pointed out in reference to the Diamantina, Rarcoo,
Hamilton, and Georgina Rivers. As the pressure of
should not exceed the amount of land represented
by a rental of £2OO per annum, and an area
of 60,000 acres. But although the system was
not directly provided for in the Act, the Land Board
sanctioned a combination among several lessees whose
farms marched with each other, and in this way what
were practically large estates could be formed. We
have referred to developments in the pastoral industry
as they took place, always on the outskirts of settlement
and always in advancement of settlement, as the work
is, for the most part understood, that is in the making
of townships and the carving out of agricultural farms ;
but as the days went on there was another movement
perceptible in a part of the country which has in the
PURE BRED DESCENDANTS AT CAMDEN PARK.
population becomes greater it cannot be doubted that
there will be combined efforts to increase the producing
power of the pastoral country as well as open up land
for agricultural settlement. What has been done in
New South Wales is an object lesson that must be taken
to heart and acted on sooner or later.
In the meantime there were noteworthy develop-
ments in another direction, for whatever we may think
of the leasing principle underlying the Dutton Land
Act as a whole and its application particularly to agri-
cultural holdings, there can be no question but that an
extraordinary stimulus was given to pastoral settlement
by the provision regarding the acquisition of
farms. It was provided that the maximum area
minds of visitors aroused wonder at the capabilities of
the country in regard to the rearing of flocks. For in
the late sixties and the early seventies the Darling Downs
stations had evolved beyond the pioneering stage of the
early days. The toil, the anxiety, and the danger had
passed; the romance had given place to the management
of magnificent estates on a scale unknown in Europe,
while prosperity had brought in its train all the ameni-
ties of life to which Anthony Trollope referred when
speaking of station life in Victoria during his visit to that
Colony in 1872. The heirs of the pioneers of the Darling
Downs weie enjoying the fruits of the energy and enter-
prise of those who had gone before them. In many in-
stances full advantage had been taken of every legislative


measure, and also, doubtless, of every statutory
loophole, with the result that in many cases the original
leasehold grazing properties had become freehold, and
where the goal had not been attained a very effective
means of shutting the door against all intruders had
been taken by the simple means of selecting for freehold
occupation all the portions of a station which could be
utilized by the agricultural selector. No one could do
the work of selection so deftly as the men who had been
daily riding over the country for many years and knew
the best jjarts of the run, the alienation of which would
render the other parts of the station useless to selectors,
water facilities and roads being the main factors in the
question after the quality of the soil. After all, however,
it was impossible to lock the door against the selector,
who was already clamouring for entrance. It was
impossible to hide the fact that there were millions of
acres of land on the Darling Downs second to none for
agricultural purposes, and although there were among
the early squatters men who could and did deny that,
we can only attribute the denial to the inability of
many men to see beyond the rock-like barriers of
their interests, or to jiicture what might be accom-
plished by the aid of railways, the railways
which they in the first instance had sought so
eagerly. As the pioneer pastoralists followed the
explorers, so the agriculturists followed the squatters.
In many instances the owners of large estates accepted
facts, and themselves met the desires of the farmers by
cutting up their holdings. Many had done so, and
realized large profits, either selling to syndicates, who
in turn prepared the land for farms by subdividing it
into suitable homesteads, or doing that work themselves.
There was yet another method of moving squatters to
comply with the demands of those who sought agri-
cultural land, and did not see why they should not
obtain it, when so much country that could produce
wheat and other crops in abundance was devoted to the
rearing of stock. Hence was framed the Act by which
the selector came into his own. Estates which had been
alienated in favour of the pastoral lessees were re-
purchased by the Government, and all over the country,
not only on the Darling Downs, but in West Moreton,
freehold was bought at a fair valuation, surveyed and
cut up into farms varying in area from 80 acres upwards.
And the great benefit that the selector enjoyed came
from the fact that he was dealing with a vendor who
could afford to wait for the purchase money, just as
there was waiting when the land was taken directly from
the Crown, for in the case of farms on those repurchased
estates the purchaser was given twenty-five years in
which to pay for his land. So the door was opened
wide to the farmer, and as a result mixed farming, and
later dairying on a systematic and co-operative system,
was undertaken and expanded rapidly. The stations
were really not injured, although many an early settler
might declare they were, for new markets were opened.
And though the bounds of the stations were smaller
the financial results were larger. Lambs were raised for
export, and crossbreds also became a feature of station
produce. Lincoln or Leicester sheep became crossed
with the merino, while Southdowns and Romneys were
also tried. A very interesting feature of sheep-farming
on the Darling Downs was a herd of black merino sheep
raised by Mr. Allan, of “Braeside,” Dalveen. As the
result of experiments following his own observations on
the subject, Mr. Allan, in 1877-8, began to breed black
sheep. The success attained was beyond expectation,
and with an enterprise which deserved success the
woollen factory at Ipswich produced a woven fabric,
admirable in texture and appearance, and which pos-
sessed the very important advantage of being a natural
colour, not black, as some jjeople might suppose, but a
lustrous brown, which would not fade. Beyond that, black
sheep were found to be hardier and more active than
their white merino cousins, and still more important trey
did not suffer so much in drought. The mutton, which
is somewhat darker in hue than that of the white sheep,
is sweeter than the better-known meat. For the wool
facts speak very clearly, and at the sales in London in
1885 the fleece wool of Mr. Allan’s flock sold in grease
brought more than double the average price, Is. of
white merino wool in grease.
In many districts cattle were more suitable, as we
have said, owing to the natural grasses, and in more
than one district squatters began with sheep and finished
by rearing cattle. Undoubtedly cattle offered a great
advantage in some respects as compared with sheep,
especially in regard to pioneering work, and no less in
the important question of marketing, for a bullock
doomed to the slaughter-yards could himself walk
thither. As time went on the outlet in markets widened
greatly, but in the seventies and early eighties the
Colonies of New South Wales and Victoria were
the best customers. South Australia was also
a purchaser of fat cattle. Later the Govern-
ment realized the advantage to the community that
co-operation between the Government and private
enterprise must confer, and so came aid in the institution
ol State farms, as at Gatton Agricultural College, and
the importation of prize stock from the United Kingdom
and elsewhere. Studs were raised and the produce sold
to stock-owners at from ten to fifteen guineas a head.
Good seasons and the best facilities for stock-breeding
had at intervals presented a danger to stock-owner's,
and it is very interesting to note that as the pressure


came so was it relieved. Escape from the ills of over-
production was afforded in the first instance by boiling
down sheep and cattle, and in evidence of the cheapness
of meat in those days we have instances of squatters
hiring a spring cart and vending meat at Id. per lb. in
the townships near to their stations. That was done
occasionally in Maryborough. Following the boiling-down
of surplus stock, which was, after all, a very imperfect
remedy, though welcome at the time, there were tent-
ative experiments in making extract of meat at Redbank,
near Ipswich, and Yengarie, near Maryborough. But
neither the one remedy nor the other was sufficient, and
a good season with propitious rains and fat stock meant
a glut in the market, even when fullest allowance was
made for the outlet by overlanding cattle to the
Southern Colonies or shipping bullocks from Glad-
stone to New Caledonia, which took place as the result
of thought, at once happy and practical. But the
difficulty was too big for any partial remedy to work a
cure, and so came the meatworks and vast exportations
of frozen and chilled beef and mutton from Australia
and also New Zealand. The proof that the system was
effective was shown by the reaction of exportations on
the price of meat to Australian consumers. And it may
be pointed out that had not the exportation of beef
and mutton become a crucial element in the pastoral
industry of the country the prices would not have been
affected by the war as they were. Refrigeration brought
the flesh food of Australasia within the zone of war
prices, and kept it there. What the export of meat
soon became to the stock-holders may be gauged by the
fact that during six years —1901 to 1906—the total
exports from the Colony amounted to 353,514,135 lb. of
beef and 371,692,090 lb. of mutton. And the impetus
given by increased demand through the European mar-
kets being opened to Australian meat reacted in
stimulating production, and hence there came, as we
have seen, corresponding developments in stock-raising,
the tendencies being always in the direction of smaller
runs. Nothing more calculated to advance a pastoral
country than the grazing-farm system could be imagined,
and that it succeeded we have proof in the fact that
beyond the power granted by Parliament to acquire a
portion of any station property for purposes of selection,
there came the meeting of a greater demand in the
repurchase of estates for sale. It may be held that that
was another development in the expansion of agriculture,
but the expansion of arable farming could not but mean
the previous development of the pastoral industry. In
1884-5 the herds of cattle for the most part were
descended from Durham and shorthorn stock. About
2 per cent, were graded Herefords, and there were also
Devon crosses. Beyond that were herds of Ayrshires
and Aberdeen Polled Angus, witli stock from Alderney
and Brittany. As an instance of the magnificent advan-
tages offered in the Queensland climate and herbage for
stock-raising, we find at that time a reference to the
great success of the Monkira herd, near the western
border, and not far from the centre of the continent.
Those cattle, culled from the best herds of the day in
the United Kingdom, were found to thrive excellently
on the indigenous grasses of far-western Queensland, and
became so hardy as to travel 1,000 miles to market over
country in many parts so scantily watered as to present
waterless stretches of sixty to eighty miles.
The horses at that time in the Colony—in the mid-
eighties—comprised in all: Blood stock, 3,000; saddle
horses, 130,000; light harness horses, 90,000; and heavy
draughts, 10,000. The blood stock, though chiefly used
for racing, was greatly availed of for improving the
breed of hacks, and prices ranged from £3O to £5OO.
Of the saddle horses the best comprised half-breds, and
all were capable of great endurance. Their prices
varied from £5 to £5O. Of the light harness horses the
majority were the produce of well-bred sires and active
farm mares. There was also coming into vogue a
superior class descended from Cleveland bays and
Norfolk trotters. The prices ranged from £lO to £5O.
It may be said that sugar-growing first gave a marked
impetus to the breeding of heavy draught stock which
were in the initiative perforce drawn from New South
Wales. Queensland farmers, realizing the advantage
accruing from turning their attention to that branch of
stock-raising, devoted themselves largely to it, and fine
animals of the Clydesdale and Shire breeds, with the
Suffolk Punch, were raised. Prices varied from £25 to
£5O. Later Queensland, realizing the facilities given by
direct steamship communication with India, followed the
example of Victoria, and despatched many horses to the
Indian market, where they found ready sale at pro-
fitable prices, being sold not only for hacks, but also
as remounts for the Indian army. All Australian
horses were known under the generic name of Wafers,
the first sent being from New South Wales. It was
along the lines of modified relations, altered circum-
stances, inferred by the changes we have noted, that the
pastoral industry thenceforth was to advance, for in
future years the outlet for surplus stock, becoming
greater, and the demand increasing, did not alter the
system, but only caused the factors in evolution to act
more swiftly and more thoroughly on old methods which
they were supplanting. Indeed, it would be hard to
imagine any very great change in the systems now
being used more and more as the years go on. For
freezing and chilling; grazing farms, with the raising of
stock by arable farmers; together with artesian boring
and water conservation adopted more widely, seem to be
the last words in regard to the pastoral industry.


CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE SUGAR INDUSTRY: ITS WEAKNESS, ITS STRENGTH.
We have in some wise traced the beginnings of
the sugar industry in viewing the sequence of progress
in some of the districts adapted to the cultivation of
sugar-cane. Yet the Hon. Captain Louis Hope and
Messrs. Wish and Trevelyan, with Mr. Adam, the
settler from Bourbon, in the Clarence district, who
had ventured into sugar-planting, and Dr. Lang, who
theorized concerning the industry under slave conditions
in Brazil and drew the conclusion, many years before
his time, that it could be carried on by means of white
labour—not one of those was the first to look to Aus-
tralia as a field for sugar production. For in 1823, shortly
before a settlement was destined to be formed at Moreton
Bay, Mr. Thomas Scott, of Port Macquarie, New South
Wales, had proved that cane could be grown, but, far
more than that, it could be manufactured into sugar, for
Mr. Scott made seventy tons of sugar five years later.
We learn also that a West Indian planter sought conces-
sions from the Colonial Office for the establishment of
sugar-growing on a large scale in the Moreton Bay dis-
trict, but his terms were not acceptable to the Minister
in charge of Colonial Affairs, and the proposition came
to nothing.
It is to no purpose to conjecture what might have
happened had the prospective pioneer received the same
consideration as was given to Captain Macarthur in
regard to the pastoral development of the Mother Colony.
Undoubtedly when Dr. Lang advocated sugar-planting
he had personal knowledge that cane would grow
luxuriously in the Moreton Bay settlement, and this
we must allow, although we may differ from the worthy
Doctor’s deductions and generalizations. In 1862 M.
Buhbt, whose knowledge of sugar-planting carried on in
the colonial possessions of France entitled him to be
considered an authority, asserted that sugar-growing was
practically possible, and he verified the result of his
observations by manufacturing sugar in 1862.
Along the banks of the Brisbane above the city, on
the Logan and Albert, the Caboolture and Mary Rivers
and Tinana Creek, sugar farms were formed, mills
erected, and the industry went ahead speedily. The
Pioneer River then entered the industry, and the rich
lands behind Port Mackay became fields of waving sugar-
cane for a distance of ten or twelve miles inland. In
the meantime the capabilities of the banks of the Burnett
River, between Bundaberg and the sea, had attracted
attention, and plantations being formed there soon made
known the magnificent possibilities of the Woongarra
scrub, a few miles from the town and facing the ocean
beach. The pioneers who lighted on the scrub lands,
and realized what they promised in regard to sugar
growing, found they were born under a lucky star, for
as the qualities of the rich soil became known investors
flocked in, those who were fortunate enough to be first
in the field in regard to the selection of the country
reaping as rich a harvest as did the pioneers at Mackay.
In the meantime there had been experiments in sugar-
growing in the Rockhampton district, but for some
reason, which never seems to have been satisfactorily
explained, the industry did not develop as might have
been expected. Later the growing demand for more
and more sugar land caused selection to go on apace at
the Johnstone River, Cairns, Mourilyan Harbour, Port
Douglas, and even at the Bloomfield River, not many
miles south of Cooktown.
As in the pastoral industry, so was it in regard to
sugar. Progress was evolved under the pressure
of circumstances, which indeed led those interested not
whither they would go, but in a different direction.
For even the strongest supporter of sugar-growing, as it
was carried on in the old days, cannot deny that the
system in vogue then provided for cheap labour, far
different from that sanctioned by custom and approved
by law in the other. Colonies. The growers in Queens-
land wanted cheap labour, and they got it.
The indentees were, it is true, protected on the
plantations; but the treatment of the “boys” depended
much on the character and tendencies of those
who were in charge of them. That no special hardships
were suffered by the islanders may be attributed to the
decency of the white people on the plantations. The
islanders while in the Colony did not seem unhappy,
being well fed, and certainly better clad than ever in
their lives before. They varied in disposition, as do
whites, some being industrious and energetic, acute in
learning, and keen in fulfilling duties, while others were
born skulkers. The system in the beginning was an adapt-
ation of that in the West Indies, where coolie labour
was used, and where the central mill system was even
then making its way. For on the rivers, from the
Albert and Logan away north to the Pioneer, the mill-
owner held the key of the situation in his hand. Sugar
machinery was extensively in use, and although it has
been said that good results were obtained from the small
mills worked by horse-power, of which there were several
on the southern rivers, the tendency was in favour of
as complete appliances as could be obtained, and that
was the reason for the establishment of the Co-operative
Central Mill, equipped with full crushing power, the
latest word in vacuum boiling and labour-saving devices,
at a cost of some £50,000. Save, perhaps, at Yen-
garie, near Maryborough, and one or two of the mills in


the Mackay district, that stage had not been reached,
although ere many years the Government was to vote
£50,000 for the erection of two State mills at Mackay.
In most cases the mill, while being fairly efficient in
the extraction of the sugar content of the cane, by no
means had the best machinery available. The sugar-
boiling appliances stood midway between the wasteful
open-pan, or battery system, and the triple vacuum-pan
apparatus, the former being just the same as that
described by Dr. Lang during a visit to Pernambuco,
in the forties. Steam-jacketed pans averted danger from
the burning of the crystallizing and concentrating juice.
There were all the latest appliances for drying the sugar;
in other words, driving out the semi-liquid molasses by
centrifugal force and leaving
the sugar fit for market.
Such mills, factories, or
works cost from £B,OOO to
£lO,OOO, and could often
deal with more cane than the
mill-owner himself had ready
for the rollers. All around,
however, on the southern
rivers there- were farmers
ready to grow cane could
they be sure that it would
be crushed, so that each pro-
prietary mill soon had a host
of supplying cane-growers.
The system was, indeed, very
similar to the central dairy,
except in one particular,
that the mills in those days,
without exception, stood in
line with their cane-growing
neighbours, and often the
mill-owners had a consider-
able acreage under cane. So
eager were the farmers to
obtain milling facilities that
they willingly accepted the
mill-owners’ terms that the
cane would be crushed “on halves”; that is, the miller
got half the result as payment for extracting the sugar
content of the cane. As years went on that arrangement
gave place to one more consonant with the business aspect
of the question. Then it became more convenient to throw
a large staff of men on a sugar farm and remove the cane
as quickly as possible. So came it that the farmers
found it to their advantage to hire Polynesian cane-
cutters, part of the mill staff, who with their white
overseers came to the farm and remained there cutting
and loading the huge punts by which many tons of cane
were floated up and down the river. Let us try to picture
the scene as it was at the height of the crushing season,
with the mill on the bank of one of the wide tidal rivers,
a primitive tramline linking it with the wharf, more or
less substantial, just as business, not safety, required.
Alongside the mill were cook-house, blacksmith’s
forge, and wheelwright’s shop, with the houses of the
white employes, and further on the huts of the kanakas.
The “boys” loved to make huts after their own island
model, and cool they certainly were in summer, but
other advantages were not apparent to the white
observer. And yet it was with difficulty that the
islanders could be persuaded to occupy the large frame-
houses specially built for them. Beyond and around on
every side were waving canefields, while the grinding
of the rollers and whirr of wheels could be heard afar
off. Sometimes the mill
worked late, and the is-
landers held high holiday,
receiving some slight con-
cession of payment for their
overwork. And often were
boiling operations carried on
all night. Rain had a ten-
dency to lower the density;
that is, weaken the sugar
content of the cane, and thus
there was bustle when cane
cutting began until it was
finished. Such was the
system in use during the
first ten years of sugar-
growing in Queensland, and
it served.
Then came an improve-
ment in the system of
treatment inaugurated on
the Mary River, and then
at Bundaberg, for a patent
was secured by Messrs. Tooth
and Cran, of Yengarie, and
later of Millaquin and Bun-
daberg, whereby the extra
amount of lime necessary to
be added to the cane juice to prevent fermentation could
be extracted after its purpose had served. For the system
was in brief to avoid transporting the cane by conveying
the juice. The theory was that every cane-grower should
possess a small crushing plant, the cane juice being run
into tanks on the old-time punts and floated to the
central mill.
During all the time proprietary mills had the
monopoly of crushing for cane-growers, who had no
sugar-making machinery, there was always a movement
towards the co-operative system which subsequently took
form under State aid. Farmers were often dis-
satisfied ; there was grumbling at the order in which the

various areas of cane were cut, and although obviously
only the crop of one grower could be taken off first, all
wanted to be first. And the subject of frost came in
and made the point still more important in the Mary
River and Bundaberg districts, with the cane-producing
localities further to the south. Again, as time went on,
the growers claimed that the charges for crushing the
cane and converting it into sugar should be reduced.
That demand in time led to the abandonment of the
system used for calculating charges for milling, which
certainly were very high in the early years of the
industry, and there was introduced a very just method
of purchasing the cane, for it was valued according to
its sugar content. And just as the mill-owners met
the wishes of the grower, that very action caused some
of the latter to be more suspicious, and thus an
antagonism, perhaps unavoidable under the circum-
stances, continued to grow. It might be deemed that
those sugar-growers with moderate areas of cane, who
had manufacturing facilities, were fortunate, and indeed
things went more smoothly with them than was the
case with those who had invested a very large amount
of capital in milling machinery. The fact that very few
estates confined their manufacturing operations to their
own cane made the question in the industry to which
we have alluded of paramount importance. Beyond that
there was a tendency to hold small milling plants in
contempt, and much was heard in those days of the
loss sustained by insufficient power at the rollers, leading
to a considerable amount of juice remaining in the cane.
There were wise and cautious advisers like Mr. Angus
Mackay, who strongly advocated the adoption of milling
plants within the reach of any farmer who had a fairly
large area of land adapted to cane cultivation, but the
imperfect extraction of juice on the one hand, and the
further objection that a high-grade sugar could not be
manufactured in the small mills, prevented the industry
developing as it should in that direction.
It is not difficult to understand that all the circum-
stances in the industry on which we have but touched
could only have one of two results. Either the sugar-
growing farms would have been absorbed by the mills,
or, as eventually did take place, co-operative
action, which secured for the cane-grower a share in a
large central mill. Meanwhile the relations between
growing cane and manufacturing sugar slowly modified
until they took form and materialized under the Sugar
Works Guarantee Act. Other developments went on
contemporaneously. The leasing system was largely
adopted by sugar-mill proprietaries like the Colonial
Sugar Refining Company and other mill-owners in the
Mackay district who had been fortunate in securing
large blocks of sugar land. The system worked well,
as also did that other partial co-partnership by which
a prospective cane-grower was enabled to secure land
within easy access of a mill equipped with all the best
and latest machinery for crushing and manufacturing,
and beyond that could obtain the fullest facilities for
conveyance of the cane to the mill by means of tram
lines, permanent or temporary, which formed a verit-
able network through the land owned or controlled by
the mill. A similar system was introduced at Bunda-
berg, and later in the Isis sugar country, and has done
much wherever it is in operation to encourage farmers
to enter on cane planting. Away north as far as Port
Douglas the system has developed simultaneously with
co-operative sugar-mill companies under State aid.
The seventies and the early eighties were the
heydey of sugar-growing in Queensland. The sugar
market of Australia had not been overtaken and prices
were excellent; kanaka labour, although condemned
by public opinion, was still available. On all
the rich alluvial flats of the large rivers the
cultivation of cane went on apace. The industry
paid—its expansion proved that—and the fact that
in the Wide Bay district, notably at Mount Bauple,
and also near the coast, and beyond that at the far
more extended districts around Bundaberg, sugar farm
has been added to sugar farm and mill to mill is con-
clusive proof that the industry is one very suitable to
Queensland in almost all its coastal belts. The time
was to come in the first years of the nineties, when the
extraordinary rich soil of the Isis scrub was to attract
the attention of men in search of sugar land. Railway
facilities gave the all-important concession cf carriage.
Childers became a town, and conditions far more pro-
sperous and permanent than on many a goldfield made
for great prosperity. It is quite interesting to
remember that in the initiative sugar-growing in
the locality caused some persons to express fears
lest an inland district might not afford the per-
manent advantages the other places presented. All
fears, however, proved groundless, and the Isis district
as it is to-day is proof that its pioneers were as shrewd
in reasoning as they were in seizing opportunities. In
the Mackay district the pressure was always inland if
northward as well. There, also, sugar-cane took root
and throve inland as far as Eton and away in other
directions, where cane was grown and mills were built
far outside the limits of what was truthfully the ten-mile
ladius from Mackay of the sugar lands as they were in
the very early days. Later than Mackay in its develop-
ment came the rich sugar lands of the Burdekin delta,
and all the time in the purely tropical belts of the
Colony sugar was grown and mills were built. And
while indented coloured labour was tottering to its fall


the interacting yet strongly opposed interests of mill-
owners and cane-growers were meeting, circumstance
making for the solution of the problem, which always
turned to one point; the need for the cane-growers
individually possessing an interest in a mill, so that
their interests in their cane might be safeguarded in
the stages after it left the field. The cane supplier
saw he must be something else, a sugar manufacturer.
How was the transformation to be achieved. The vote
of £50,000 by Parliament for two mills at Mackay was
a promise that the problem could be solved. The Sugar
Works Guarantee Act, introduced by Sir Hugh Nelson
when Premier, fulfilled all expectations, and by a
those most opposed to the employment of coloured
indentees realized that if the system were forcibly and
immediately stopped a very serious loss would be
inflicted on an industry that had taken, the lead in
primary productions in the Colony. There were some
politicians who held that tropical fruit production in
the North would prove an admirable substitute for
sugar-growing, and there were suggestions for placing
fast steamers with refrigerating facilities at the service
of cane-growers, who might turn their attention to
fruit-growing. There was, however, a touch of the
unpractical about the proposal, and there remained the
fact that with the prospect of a stoppage being placed

magician’s wand made the small cane-growers real and
active part proprietors in mills, surpassed nowhere in
the completeness of their crushing and manufacturing
machinery and the effective winning from the cane of
the last particle of its saccharine content. The difficulty
which had troubled cane-growers for nearly thirty years
was solved, very simply, yet in a most business-like
manner.
As the years went on the strong antagonism to
kanaka labour became more apparent, and it was
decided that no further licences to> recruit should be
issued. That, however, was so drastic a step that
E
on recruiting in the Pacific, the value of sugar land,
which had soared at a rate commensurate with the
advancing prosperity of the industry, at once sank
to an extent that could only mean one thing, ruin,
absolute ruin, to those who had invested in many
instances large fortunes in plantation properties. In
not a few instances investors had come from England.
Land had been bought under the belief that kanaka
labour would be available, and the question came up
for decision in the highest court of moral equity whether
such an act, contemplated, and indeed carried into
practice, would not infer an infliction of injustice on


those who could hardly be held blameworthy, in so far
as they had only taken advantage of the system that, at
the time their investments in sugar property were made,
was recognized and specially validated by statutory
enactment. The same argument applied to those who,
having purchased sugar-mill machinery at great expense,
found that the crushing and boiling plants were likely
to become as useless and as valueless as scrap iron.
Under the circumstances ruin faced Northern Queens-
land and all interested in the sugar industry. Apart
from individual hardship and loss, reducing to poverty
those who were previously rich, there was the wider and
national question of all that the dropping out of cane-
growing as an industry from the list of Queensland’s
assets meant. Could the young Colony face the industrial
paralysis in the North, and as far south as Bundaberg
and Wide Bay, were sugar-planting to cease ? And
cease it would, asserted sugar-growers, were kanaka
labour forbidden. Statesmen like Sir Samuel Griffith,
firmly convinced though they were that sugar-growing
could be carried on by means of white labour, realized
that it would be hard and cruel to cut off one
source of labour entirely before another was provided.
Therefore a Royal Commission was appointed to
inquire into the conditions of the sugar industry, and
as a result of their work in 1887 a report was presented
to Parliament, the outcome being the very sensible
decision to permit kanaka labour to continue for a
period of ten years; in other words, sugar-planters
were given a period in which to set their house in order.
There was absolute finality about the deportation of all
Polynesians, but the transition from coloured labour
to white was to be effected in ten years. Would the
change be brought about without dislocating industrial
interests ? Many at the time doubted, and hot a few
sugar-growers expressed their determination to escape
from the catastrophe they feared as quickly and with
as little loss as possible.
In the midst of difficulty and doubt the problem was
solved, for already two State central mills had been
erected at Mackay, and the Sugar Works Guarantee
Act was practically an extended application of the
system adapted to the wants of all. “Give the sugar-
growers ample milling facilities for their cane, with
interests in the mills, and they will solve the coloured
labour question fully and for ever.” That was the
thought behind the legislation introduced by Sir Hugh
Nelson, when Premier of the Colony in 1893, and the
logical power and sound common-sense of the Scot’s
statesmanship solved the problem. Briefly the Act pro-
vided for the borrowing of money by groups of land-
owners on the security of their land, the men thus
mortgaging their properties becoming members of a
given co-operative central mill company. Such mem-
bers became suppliers of cane, undertaking to plant a
given area according to the position they occupied in
the company. There was also provision for non-supply-
ing members. The land was valued, and being
approved the mill company took form, the farmers
electing directors and the Government exercising super-
vision by having representatives on the controlling
board, those representatives being for the most part
Government officials in the district concerned. The
farmers, with aid from their partner, the State, thus
managed the affairs of the central mill. The sugar-
grower of limited means became a partner in an
up-to-date sugar-mill. The dream of the sugar-growing
selector was realized beyond all expectation. Very good
terms were given by the Government, loans for purchase
of mill machinery, buildings, and tram lines being
granted at 5 per cent, interest, provision being made for
repayment in forty years. Provision in the Act was
made for mill companies who might neglect to fulfil their
obligations, for there was a clause in the Statute which
empowered the Government in such a case to step in
and control and manage the mill company’s affairs.
Although that provision has in one or two instances
been put in operation, it must be said that the com-
panies for the most part carried on their business as
sugar manufacturers exceedingly well. A staff of
skilled officers, including a chemist, assisted the farmers
who were encouraged by the vista of prosperity opening
before them to provide for the future by employing
white labour as far as possible. So' Queensland’s depend-
ence on kanaka labour was shown to be in great measure
imaginary, though Polynesians were employed by
the owners of the larger estates as long as their tenure
of the labour lasted. The smaller growers found it to
their advantage to employ white labour instead of in-
volving themselves in obligations for a service of three
years, and indeed the Polynesian, when the sole coloured
man on a farm, or where there were but two or three
islanders, was sometimes anything but an acquisition.
Further, outrages on the part of kanakas, with murders
and many a tribal fight, did much to reconcile even the
strongest supporter of coloured labour to the going of
the Polynesians. So often did tribal disturbances occur
that sometimes much alarm was caused, for serious and
even fatal injuries were inflicted, and on one occasion
the streets of Mackay were made the scene of a pitched
battle, in which the man-eating Malayta “boys”
figured as belligerents.
Such were the factors in the passing of the kanaka,
and so wisely were the means provided whereby the small
suppliers of cane were led into self-help and moved by
circumstances to employ white labour, that when the


last shipload of Polynesians were repatriated few of the
sugar-growers missed them. It was with a sigli of relief
from the great majority of cane-grbwers that the last
of the islanders, grotesquely hugging their cherished
“boxes,” were seen making their way on board the
steamer homeward bound. A few planters there were
who hoped for another extension of kanaka service, but
with the coming of the Commonwealth all hope in that
direction failed. The flag of a White Australia was
flown in the breeze.
With Federation the evolution of the white worker
industry by the Federal bonus, and the compensation
thus given for the banishment of the kanaka, the diffi-
culties of the sugar-grower do not seem'to be at an end.
And yet we have crucial test that sugar production keeps
on increasing.
We have shown the advantages, stupendous indeed
at the time, which the Sugar Works Guarantee Act
gave to small growers, and without dwelling on the
beneficial effect of the co-operative system and the
price which the co-operative mill paid for cane, it is
very obvious that while a healthy rivalry was set up

went on apace. Labour-saving.appliances in the form
of agricultural implements facilitated the work in the
field in all save the harvesting. Men united in oane-
cutting gangs, making contracts and money, as their skill
at the work equalled their strength and endurance. The
highest known wages in industry throughout the
world, were won. The pressure of the cane-worker
encroaching on the profits of the grower has gone on
increasing, and despite the assistance given to the
between proprietary and co-operative mills, any
monopoly in either purchase or price by the private
mill-owners was rendered impossible. The co-operative
mills set the price, for the days of cane price-fixing had
not come. From Nerang up to Port Douglas, the
littoral of Queensland blossomed under the influences
of the Sugar Works Guarantee Act, the principle of
which was extended and applied with suitable modifica-
tions to meatworks and dairying.

CHAPTER XXIX.
THE END OF THE CENTURY.
The student of history, as he scans the centuries, may
be excused if he draws the conclusion that as the cycles
pass away they leave the tracks of their going on the
nations. Be that as it may, as a general principle it
cannot be denied that for England the ending of the
four last centuries have been momentous. The Armada,
the English Revolution, the French Revolution, with
the nation-shaping thunders of Napoleonic days, and
the Boer War, perhaps the first act, or rather
German prelude, to the Great War. In view of all
this, it is very interesting to ponder how Australian
history seems to obey the principle at work in the
Empire, for without doubt in the last years of the nine-
teenth century was to be found the essence of all that
goes to make history as we have it in Australia, and
also in Queensland.
Noteworthy in other and wider fields it may be of
importance to recall the fact that though separation was
always a question of great moment in Queensland, events
stronger than the will of men or the uses of political
parties forbade the division. From the time separation
from New South Wales was mooted, the subdivision of
the great province extending northward from the Tweed
to Cape York was a burning question. And always
something, some event stronger than the desire for
separation, pushed that subject into the background.
There was a National Party then, led by Mr. Hugh Nel-
son —who subsequently became Sir Hugh Nelson —and that
party opposed the provincial system, preferring territor-
ial separation. Sir Samuel Griffith did not see his project
fructify, for the Upper House swept out of the path of
practical politics the scheme of provincial separation.
Clearly, however, there was away behind the movement
for territorial separation the interests of the planters,
and nothing perhaps could have defeated aspirations
which must have made for the rupture of Australian
interests so fully and so speedily as Federation, As a
wave sweeps in from the ocean obliterating all land-
marks, so the wave of feeling affirming the desirableness
of Commonwealth relations swept over Australia.
Nothing could withstand it, and the demand for separ-
ation, as it was desired by many, simply vanished,
being swept out of sight by the larger issue.
Tire year of 1889 is of keen interest to all Queens-
landers because of the important political events which
were staged. Two years previously there had come the
celebrations of the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria’s
reign. The event was perhaps one of the first in which
Brisbane stood for the Colony as a whole, and was
acknowledged to represent the territory. From the
Downs on the one hand, and the northern coast, as far
as it was linked with the capital by rail, there flowed
in streams of sightseers. And the city had not per-
chance the conveniences for entertaining visitors then
that it now possesses. Be that as it may, loyalty had its
way and its will, and the day became one to be remem-
bered by all present on the occasion. As light gave
way to dusk the waiting multitudes had their reward,
for the illuminations were worthy of the event. No
matter though a weary night had to be passed in the
train as a finale to the celebrations, those who took
part in them rightly measured the dignity of the day
by realizing how seldom came the opportunity for such
royal commemorations. The people of Queensland gave
rein to their loyalty; so much the celebrations showed,
for in truth they were a golden cord in the colourless
web of everyday life.
If it be true that the country which has no history
is happy, then the year of which we write brought good
fortune to Queensland, for even political events, which
stir the Colony to its depths, were unimportant.
The previous year (1888) had seen the return to power
of the Nationalists, as they called themselves, for the
general elections gave a mandate from the people to
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, who had for some years pre-
viously been an onlooker at the political arena, but
who now by a very large majority of the electors was
invited to enter the lists against Sir Samuel Griffith,
who led the Liberals. For some reason difficult
to understand at the time, and even more difficult
to explain, now that the dust of the conflict has sub-
sided, Sir Samuel Griffith was unpopular, the favour
of the mutable many had been lost. The Ministry which
took office was a powerful one, comprising, as it did,
men strong and capable, representative of Northern and
Central Queensland, for Mr. Hume Black as Minister
for Lands did Mackay credit, and Mr. W. Pattison, as
Minister without portfolio, prevented Rockhampton
from being forgotten. Mr. Hugh Nelson, whose calm
common-sense, even more than his undoubted mastery
of financial affairs, had placed him in the first rank of
colonial statesmen, held the portfolio of Railways, while
Mr. J. M. Macrossan was Minister for Mines; Mr. A.
J. Thynne, Minister for Justice; and Mr. J. Donaldson,
Postmaster-General and Minister for Education. Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith’s Ministry should have been not
only strong, but laden with good to the country, for Mr.
B. I). Morehead, the Premier’s lieutenant, who was
Colonial Secretary, was known as the “Rupert of
Debate', and, beyond that, exerted a very powerful
influence not only in the commercial world, but also
on that of flocks and herds. It was to Mr. Morehead


that the leadership of the party soon fell, for Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith in a few weeks found it necessary,
owing to his health failing, to hand over the reins to
Mr. Morehead.
During 1888 there was the emergence of
two constitutional questions, both of which might
have caused incalculable harm had not the Min-
ister for the Colonies, Lord Knutsford, displayed
a wisdom and moderation not always evinced by
the Imperial Government in dealing with over-
sea administration. In one question the Governor,
Sir Anthony Musgrave, in accordance with what he
deemed his duty, refused to follow the advice of his
Ministers by declining to
reprieve a prisoner. Look-
ing back on the very keen
interest Sir Anthony Mus-
grave took in all affairs
pertaining to Queensland
and the desire to aid the
advancement of the Colony
in every way possible, of
which the Governor’s public
utterances gave token, one
can only account for the
course Sir Anthony took in
regard to the case of a man
named Benjamin Kitts, by
the belief that for the
Government the law was
something so sacred that
absolutely no circumstances
justified the relaxation of a
penalty. Kitts was found
guilty of stealing a pair of
boots, and the facts in the
eyes of the Ministers of the
Crown, justified the use
of the Royal prerogative of
mercy. It was a bold step
the Governor took when he
declined to accept the advice of his constitutional
advisers. Popular opinion was all against the vice-regal
action, and so strongly indeed did feeling run that when
the Ministry resigned, a course inevitable, the Leadei
of the Opposition, Sir Samuel Griffith, declined to take
office. The action of the Opposition demonstrated that
the question was considered to be above and beyond
ordinary political relations and antagonisms. T he
Secretary of State, Lord Knutsford, relieved the ten-
sion by a direct order from London, for the release of
Kitts. In this way very important points of government
which might have been found difficult of settlement were
avoided. The Ministry withdrew its resignation, and
things resumed their normal course. Later in the year
came the untimely death of the Governor, arid the com-
munity, by the regret expressed on all sides at the sad
event, by the sympathy evinced for the widow of Sir
Anthony M usgrave, and in the public funeral accorded
his remains, gave a touching evidence of desire to make
amends. All knew that the Governor had acted accord-
ing to the light that was in him, and in opposing the
course he took there was always respect. It was said
at the time that the masterfulness of Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith was responsible in some measure for “the
strained relations which arose, lie that thought the
real explanation or not, the fact remains that after the
death of Sir Anthony Mus-
grave the Premier found
himself at issues with the
Colonial Office. Undoubtedly
a great principle was in the
balance, the Government
claiming the right to be con-
sulted in the appointment
of the representative of roy-
alty. The Imperial Govern-
ment had chosen Sir Henry
Blake as the new Governor.
There seems to have been
absolutely nothing to which
the most critical could ob-
ject in the gentleman chosen,
for Sir Henry Blake was
both popular and efficient.
It was his misfortune, how-
ever, to be the point on
which the constitutional dis-
pute rested. Ultimately pop-
ular opinion in Queensland
moved the Colonial Office to
substitute the name of Sir
Henry Norman for that of
Sir Henry Blake, and thus
the difficulty was averted. It
may be stated in passing that the principle of consulting
the autonomous dependencies concerning the King's
representatives has subsequently always been acknow-
ledged by the Imperial Government. Having resigned
the Premiership to Mr. Morehead, Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith made a trip to China for health reasons.
In the year 1889 changes of an important nature
took place in regard to what is now termed the Public
Service, but which was then called the Civil Service.
A Board to control the service was constituted by Act
of Parliament, and to Parliament alone was the Board
responsible. In a very important department,
that of the Railways, a change was also made
SIR THOMAS MCLLWRAITH.


in the system of administration, the rule of
three Commissioners, wholly removed from all
political influences, being substituted for that oi
one Commissioner, who had been nominally independent
of departmental influences, but who in effect was under
the control of the Minister. In yet another direction
there were changes during the year under observation,
for the Supreme Court Amendment Act provided for
the appointment of a fifth Judge. Up to that date the
Northern Court had been held at Bowen, but the time
had come when the claims of Townsville could not be
ignored, and His Honor Mr. Justice Chubb became the
fifth Judge, and with Mr. Justice Cooper took up the
business of the Northern Court. It may be of interest
to remember that the Royal Commission appointed in
this year to enquire into the causes of the depression of
the sugar industry, did not in the light of subsequent
events do much to solve the problem which was to be
dealt with effectively by Sir Hugh Nelson.
The wool clip of the year 1889 was excellent, and
with the propitious seasons gave promise of a bright
future in all that was most stable in the country’s pro-
gress. Not only, however, did the p as toral and agri-
cultural affairs bear witness to the increasing prosperity
of the Colony, for gold-mining gave token of expansion.
The Eungella field in the Mackay district was discovered,
and the richness of the stone raised hopes not fulfilled
by future results. Rain, which stimulated other factors
in progress, was not without its influences in mining.
The gold won during nine months ending September 30
totalled 557,579 oz., an amount that exceeded by
76,876 oz., the total of gold won during the whole of
the previous year. The crushings at Croydon gave very
satisfactory returns. During one trip the gold escort
brought 2,826 oz. of gold to Maryborough from the
Eidsvold field, while in the Peninsular country the
Anglo-Saxon Mine, in the Cooktown hinterland, yielded
1,070 oz. of gold from 292 tons of stone. Mining was
not confined to the mainland, for prospecting at Ham-
mond Island, in Torres Strait, was successful.
The Government was shrewdly wise in developing
the hardly-realized wealth of Queensland in dairying,
and those who are heirs of the energetic seizing of oppor-
tunity little understand how much they owe to those
who initiated the system of travelling dairies by which
districts like the Lockyer and many a point on the Downs
were practically “made over again.” To men like Mr.
Mahon, who subsequently became Principal at Gatton
Agricultural College, the country was indebted to an
extent never perhaps realized, for not only did Mr.
Mahon and his colleagues possess the gift of imparting
the knowledge they themselves had, but beyond that
they proved that they had the power of arousing
enthusiasm in the work akin to that which animated
themselves. Not only were the foundations laid of
skill, destined to produce many a prize-winner in
butter and cheese-making, but the best methods in
bacon-curing and fruit-raising were made known to all
who willed. There was little done in regard to
fruit-growing in those days, but the prosperity and
success which is attending fruit cultivation in the
Moreton districts, on the heights around Toowoomba, at
Buderirn, the Blackall Range, or further noith all
that is now being done is undoubtedly due in gieat
measure to the enthusiasm with which the Govern-
ment experts in various branches of agriculture imparted
their knowledge and shared their experience. Among
those who assisted the development of what may be
termed the new agriculture was Professor Shelton, the
first Principal of the Agricultural College, whose
manner and capacity for imparting the fund of know-
ledge he himself possessed was equalled by his devotion
to his work and his zeal in performing it.
The population of the Colony, creeping on, now
numbered 400,000, and settlement still wore the
characteristics of a new country, for males represented
two-thirds of the whole population. Flocks and herds
multiplied the prosperity of the country, and there were
in the year under review 15,000,000 sheep and 5,000,000
cattle.
In Brisbane the transformation of the city to some-
thing greater was going on unceasingly, and it is
interesting to learn that the first block of public offices
in what was called Treasury Square was completed at
a cost of £IIO,OOO, and preparations were being made
to proceed with further additions at a cost of £BO,OOO.
During the year the Custom House at the foot of Queen
Street was completed at a cost of £40,000. Other public
edifices called not only for notice, but for praise. The
Methodist Church, built on the site of the old Free-
masons’ Hall, at the intersection of Albert and Ann
Streets; St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church in Leichhardt
Street; and the ornate Baptist Church, at the inter-
section of Wickham Terrace and Edward Street, showing
evidence of energetic and purposeful development.
It is significant that there was a reaction subse-
quently from the strained relations, if such indeed is
not too strong a term to apply to the determination of
Government and people alike, that they should be con-
sulted in regard to the appointment of the vice-regal
representative. The very warm welcome accorded to
General Sir Henry Norman, and the hearty greeting
given him by 30,000 citizens who lined the streets of
Brisbane on the occasion of his official entrance on the
scene of his duties, must be traced to something deeper
than an expression of the worth and services of a great
general. Those whose memory goes back to the
days of which we write know how deeply ear-
nest Governor Norman was in his desire to aid
with all the power that in him lay the State


ol Queensland. Sir Henry Norman was one of
those whose life work, and the way it was done, forms
the best reason why the Empire is great.
It is interesting to note that sport and the interests
of sport were expanding with the advancement of the
country. A horse - loving people, Queenslanders,
through their Parliament, saw the need for restricting
betting, and legislation was introduced during the year
safeguarding the welfare of the community by restrict-
ing the use of totalizators to registered racing clubs, and
prohibiting youths from gambling.
During the year is recorded the purchase by
the Telegraph Newspaper Company of the Globe Hotel
for the sum of £42,000, and thereon was built the office
of the afternoon paper.
Nature seldom gives with both hands, and perchance
this was proved in Queensland in the days of which we
to be in a flourishing condition. With February, however,
there came a change, and rain poured down incessantly
until floods wore seen to be inevitable. The pluvial visi-
tation was in truth the heaviest experienced up to that
date, for March saw the lower parts of Brisbane awash
and flood-waters seeking their way into all the low-lying
parts of the city, South Brisbane, and the Valley. Boats
crept into the inundated streets, and many parts of the
capital assumed the appearance of an Australian Venice.
So high did the waters rise that at Goodna, some fifteen
miles up the river, it was found necessary to remove

speak, for while there was fullest recognition of the need
for agricultural knowledge, scientific, and more reliable
than the rule-of-thumb methods by the old-time
selector, yet there was inability to grasp the need for
a University education in all the faculties necessary
for professional courses. In 1889 Sir Samuel Griffith, a
student all his life, introduced a proposal for a Queens-
land University, but the time was not ripe, and the
motion was defeated by 24 votes to 16. Professor
Shelton remained the sole representative of University
teaching. As it was in the sphere of higher education,
so did it seem to be in the wider circle of the advance-
ment of the Colony as a whole. The onward march was
not to be an unbroken triumphal progress. Up to the
beginning of the year 1890 circumstances made for
prosperity, and all the great industries were reported
the flood at Rockhampton caused one of the piers of the
bridge to collapse, inflicting damage estimated at
<£6,000. It is astounding to learn how few fatalities
or serious accidents of any kind resulted from
the inundation, and in truth many a local flood has
been far more fatal, as indeed was proved by the visit-
ation at Clermont in 1917.
While the rains were beating down on the heads
of Queenslanders, another misfortune came to the sons
and daughters of the Colony, for in February the
“Quetta,” a new liner of the British India Shipping
Company, struck on a hidden reef in Albany Pass when
outward bound with a complement of passengers drawn
from all parts of Queensland. It was only a question of
minutes before the fine steamer was beneath the coral sea.
The loss of life was great, 158 out of a list of 291 being


drowned. Here and there wexe marvellous escapes, heroic
sacrifice, and no less heroic fortitude. The tidings
reached Brisbane on Sunday, March 1, the day after the
catastrophe occurred, and glooxxx and distress spread
over the commuxxity like a lowering cloud.
In the year of which we write political affairs, if
not of great moment, were extremely bitter. Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith’s illness had thrown the Ministerial
wheels out of gear, and the first months of 1890 found
the veteran leader sitting- on the cross benches, having
o > o
cut himself adrift from former friends and sujxporters.
Mr. B. D. Morehead became Chief Secretary, but
to him there also came serious indisposition, and things
were not going well for the Ministry. No Govern-
ment can plead for popularity with a deficit on its
books, no matter whether the result was due to wild
generosity or political blundering. The Treasury
accounts showed that the Ministerial business was
£1,000,000 on the wrong side of the ledger, while the
estimated expenditure was proved wrong in results to the
extent of £500,000. It was necessary to find money,
and that quest does not increase the favour of a Ministry
with taxpayei's. In the crisis, for such it practically
was, Sir Samuel Griffith, who had come into
power, chose Sir Thomas Mcllwraith as the
Treasurer of his Administration, and the strained rela-
tions existing between Sir Thomas and his former friends
enabled him to accept the offer of his one-time rival, in
whose Ministry he took office. Even in those distant
days there were hints of coalition, beyond and almost
in despite of party. The Government was a strong one,
as may be gauged by the names of the members of the
Ministry, in which Sir Samuel Griffith was Chief Secre-
tary and Attorney-General and Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
Treasurer, while Mr. Horace Tozer, was Colonial Secre-
tary and Minister for Works, and Mr. A. S. Cowley,
Minister for Lands and Agriculture. The other members
of the Cabinet were Mr. T. O. Unmack, Post-
master-General and Minister for Railways; Mr.
W. O. Lfodgkinson, Minister for Mines and
Public Instruction; and Mr. T. J. Byrnes as
Solicitor-General, with a seat in the Upper House.
It is significant that among the schemes pro-
posed by Mr. Morehead to x'aise the necessary funds was
a land tax, all freehold property above £5OO in value
being subject to the impost. The proposal, together
with that of providing for an increase in the taxes on
wines and spirits and the x’eimposition of the beer tax,
failed to give satisfaction, and thus Sir Samuel Griffith
came into power. The new Ministry, however, did not
find office a bed of roses, and the taxation proposals
which they in turn introduced were hardly more to the
taste of critics than was the policy of their predecessors.
An unpopular feature of economy, no doubt very neces-
sary, was the reduction in the rate of endowments to local
authorities from £2 to £1 per £, additional powers of
rating being given in lieu to local governing bodies. To
tins the Upper House objected, and the prospect of a
deadlock rendered the situation grave. The difficulty
was, however, overcome by reducing the powers of
municipal councils and divisional boards, respectively,
from 3d. in the £ to 2d. in the £, and from 2d. to Hd.
During these years Labourism had been sending out
political shoots in all directions, but apparently to its
followers the news that all tilings might be theirs con-
stitutionally was too good tidings to be true, for bludgeon
weapons were still believed in and still used. The mari-
time strike in 1890 was the turning of the giant in his
slumber. Officers employed by the intercolonial shipping
companies contended that they suffered from long hours
and insufficient pay, a hint of which was given during
a previous maritime strike, when the proprietaries
manned their ships for the most part with officers,
supplemented by Tartars brought from the China seas.
Then it was found advisable to divide the crews into
three watches instead of two; but the system, which
certainly relaxed the strain of work, was abandoned
when the pressure of the strike passed. In the year of
which we speak nothing practically had been done to
meet the men’s demands, and the officers formed them-
selves into an association for redress of grievances, and a
strike followed. The cessation of business which
was expected to follow the action of the cen-
tral Labour authorities in calling out seamen
and kindred trades along-shore did not take
place. There was an earnest effort on the part
of all classes of society to keep the shipping business in
motion, and it was successful in the end, despite con-
flicts between unionists and free labourers, and
when public opinion expressed itself against the strike
of the Amalgamated Shearers, in sympathy with the
maritime workers, the beginning of the end was seen to
have come. The loss in regard to labour alone was cal-
culated at £lOO,OOO, and beyond that there was much
hardship and privation inflicted on the men on strike
and their families. A dispute occurred in the
following year between the Queensland Shearers’
Union and the pastoralists. Wages or privileges
had little to do with the strike at Logan
Downs and Clermont, though the ostensible cause
of the dispute was the refusal of the unionists to sign
the agreement which the pastoralists in conference had
decided should be validated between employers and
employes. It cannot be said that the stock-
owners took up a position unjust or harsh in
regard to the shearers. They held fast by a
principle—that of freedom of contract for em-
ploye —and it was a point that Labour itself—or,
rather, a section of it—'did not for a moment dispute.
Meantime the station-owners engaged labour in


Melbourne, and the arrival of 200 free shearers in the
Clermont district was the signal for unionism to resort to
every device to win to the cause of the strikers those
whom the pastoralists had brought on the scene to foil
unionism. In all 1,000 unionists went into camp in a
scrub near Barcaldine, and also other camps, in one of
which there were 150 rifles in the hands of men who
knew how to use them, where determination was ex-
pressed that no matter what the outcome might be, the
free labour from the South must not start work. Police
Inspector Ahearn seized powder and ball and shot while
being transmitted to Clermont by the Labour leaders
and obviously the movement meant war. Attempts
at incendiarism at Northampton Downs, Maneroo,
and elsewhere demonstrated the spirit at work
joining the strikers, and there were not less than 120
teams idle at Barcaldine. Lawlessness, however, was
not gaining the day, and despite outrages here and there,
which were eventually punished, troopers of the Defence
Force proved their value, and broke up camps and
assemblages of law-breakers. Men charged with con-
spiracy and rioting were found guilty and sentenced,
the unionist leaders found themselves short ol
funds, and before long the strike was declared
oft'. After all, the hawks aimed at big quarry,
for when the disturbances were well mastered the plan
of campaign was allowed to transpire. It was no less
than the seizure of the central district and the establish-
ment there of a Bepublic. And to that end 8,000 workers,
with £20,000 as an army chest, had pledged themselves.
QUEEN STREET DURING THE GREAT FLOOD OF 1893.
underneath the surface, and attempts at train-wrecking
also bore witness to the sinister intentions of rebels, for
rebels the law-breakers were. The Government, how-
ever, was neither blind nor supine, and although it was
not very long before the strike leaders called out 2,000
of the western men, the Defence Force was by that
time under arms. A Gatling gun with sixty officers
and men, and later fifty members of the Moreton
Mounted Infantry, were placed under the command of
Major Jackson. Before the shearers realized that facts
were against them there were 1,400 men of the Defence
Force under arms, in addition to hundreds of police,
beyond whom there were also many special constables,
who rendered valuable services. The difficulties of the
settlers in the west were largely increased by the carriers
For the settlers in the Far North, those who lived
on the Peninsular seaboard, there will always be a
glamour of the romantic in the words “Merrie Eng-
land,” the Government steamer which voyaged between
the possession of PajDua and Cooktown or other ports
in Northern Queensland. A schooner of fine lines, con-
verted all too late into a steamer, some were inclined
to think the “Merrie England” rolled her tall masts
through arcs too wide in the sky. For that many a
visitor to New Guinea will recall his trip on waters
always ruffled by the south-east trades, and for that
doubtless the steamer, once the cruising yacht of Lord
Rothschild, was remembered by the Premier of Queens-
land, Sir Samuel Griffith, and his two sons, who voyaged
to Papua in the Government steamer in the year 1891.


Like many another adventurer into wild seas, the
“Merrie England” struck an unknown reef, and went
down in the sunlit yraters off the Papuan coast.
When the curtain lifted on 1893 there were few
could have dreamed of the dramatic interest
which the time was to bring in a flood, the equal of
which had never before been experienced, and in finan-
cial disruptions cataclysmic in result. There have been
many attempts to formulate a theory as to the periodicity
of floods in Queensland, but all have failed.
Intense heat, the like of which in the opinion of many
had not previously been experienced, attended the
Christmas holidays, and the first days of the year. On
all sides heat and drought-withered vegetation had
played havoc with the hopes of stock-owners. Yet the
abnormal high temperatures brought their own remedy
in the answering weather conditions. A serious gale
on the coast as January waned was the first warning
that extraordinary phenomena might be expected.
Brisbane suffered with its environs, wild winds injuring
shipping, wrecking houses, and destroying crops. Then
came heavy rains, with the result that the lower por-
tions of the capital were submerged, the wharves being
under water. As an immediate result of the phenomenal
rainfall the North Coast Eailway was interrupted at
Cooran. On February 2 the colonists had reason to
measure their rainfall by feet instead of inches, for on
that day no less than 35 inches of rain fell, and the timid
began to make comparisons with things as they were
reported to have been in the Deluge. The residents of
Copmanhurst, in the Blackall Range, had reason to won-
der, for the record for five days ending February 4 was
78 inches. The watercourses, small and large, were filled
with rushing torrents, a menace to life. The Brisbane
River swept in tawny waves far beyond its bounds, and
every hollow soon filled. Many houses were swept off
their foundations and carried down stream until driven
with relentless force against the piers and upper works
of Victoria Bridge, and at each impact the fragments
of a house swept down the stream. No structure built
by man seemed strong enough to withstand the blows
delivered time and again. As was anticipated,
the railway bridge at Indooroopilly, which had cost
£52,000, was swept away, and next day, February 5,
the Victoria Bridge went. Then followed the loss of
the railway bridge across the Mary at Antigua, while
lower down the bridge at Maryborough, a wooden
structure, giving access to the Gympie Road, was swept
away. In local phrase, “the Mary was up,” the river
being 80 ft. above the ordinary level at Gympie. The
Mary, as is its wont on such occasions, broke bounds
utterly, and took a short cut across the half-circle of
country around which the river flows in normal times, the
result being that all that was Maryborough proper was
simply under water. As it was with the Mary River,
so it was with the Brisbane. Craft broke away in the
upper reaches, and the Government steamer “Paluma,”
the coastal trader “Elemang,” and a hulk named the
“Mary Evans,” forced from their moorings, were
stranded in Garden Reach. Punts also floated down-
stream, and were an added danger to river traffic. The
streets in the lower parts of the city were below water
to the extent of 15 or 16 feet. Again Goodna was sub-
merged, the problem of rescuing the inmates of the
mental hospital once more arising. At Fernvale, on
the Upper Brisbane, the river was 24 ft. above the
mark of the 1890 flood. In a coal pit at North
Ipswich—that of Wright’s Eclipse—seven men were
entombed, while at Blackstone, a colliery some two
mifes from Ipswich, four children were drowned, a
constable losing his life in the heroic attempt to save
the mother, whose rescue was ultimately effected. The
Burnett, known for its conditions under flood, did
not rise so high as during other pluvial visitations, but
still the lower portions of Bundaberg were under water.
In Brisbane the highest point of the flood was reached
on February 6, but although efforts in relief were then
initiated, there was a second, and yet again a third
return of flood conditions, on the 10th, and between
the 16th and 20th, respectively. It cannot be said that
either the second or third recrudescence of the calamity
increased very seriously the losses already sustained.
Proposals for relief were well devised and as prompt as
they were effective. Funds came in readily at the call
of the Relief Committee, and the aid given showed how
widespread was the sympathy elicited, for beyond
subscriptions from Queensland and the other Australian
Colonies, there came assistance for the suffering from
New Zealand, New Guinea, and Fiji, together with the
United Kingdom and the United States. Nothing but
good words in fullest appreciation followed the work of
the Relief Committee, which completed in October the
disbursement of the funds placed at its disposal. In
all the labour of love meant a big work, for no less than
£83,000 was distributed among 10,945 families, or
27,238 individuals, the administration being effected at
a rate surprisingly economical—£9ll, a little over 1 per
cent.
No sooner had the floods abated in the country than
there came the banking catastrophe. The first note
of alarm was struck on February 8 in the suspension
of payment by the Deposit Bank. A scheme was put
foith to raise funds by disposing of properties in the
hands of the Bank, and valued at £1,050,000. The
proposal had tire element of chance about it which
appealed to popular taste, and there was consequently
widespread interest in the drawing, which took place
during December. With the advent of April there


came surprise after surprise, deepening into constern-
ation, as one banking corporation after another closed
its doors. Between April 4 and May 17 no less than
eight banking institutions announced inability to meet
engagements, and as in a procession there came a fateful
list, each one as it put up its shutters adding to the
commercial unrest and the general perturbation, even
apart from those cases in which there was severe loss and
hardship entailed. The Commercial Bank of Australia
was the first to stop business, and was followed at
intervals of a few days by the English, Scottish, and
Australian Chartered Bank, the Australian Joint Stock
Bank, the London Chartered Bank, the Queensland
National Bank, the Bank of North Queensland, the Com-
mercial Bank of Sydney, and the Royal Bank. The cir-
cumstances were unexampled, and Parliament saw its
duty very clearly in aiding financial institutions to make
41 per cent. In passing, it may be mentioned that the
question of unemployment became urgent during the
early months of the year, being seriously accentuated
by the floods and bank failures. Considerable relief
was afforded by the Labour Bureau, but the legislative
measures introduced in relief did not show that Parlia-
ment had wholly escaped from the theoretical into
practical aid affording.
The event of the year, and indeed of the decade,
in the political sphere was the passing out of the
Parliamentary arena of Sir Samuel Griffith, who,
following a time-honoured custom of the Bar on its
political side, “took ermine,” accepting the Chief
Justiceship of the Colony. The relinquishment of all
political offices by the veteran leader led to the acceptance
by Mr. H. M. Nelson of the Premiership, Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith being then absent recuperating in India.
VIEW FROM BULIMBA ACROSS TO TOORAK DURING THE FLOOD, FEBRUARY, 1893.
arrangements as speedily as possible for resuming busi-
ness, as the failures practically represented a commercial
deadlock.
The efforts in aid were successful, as was proved by
the fact that in a few months, on August 7, all the
banks were re-opened. It is very difficult to convey to
those who have had no experience of a financial crisis
the terrible anxiety of spirit in which people moved
from day to day during the financial stress of 1893.
The panic spread, as was natural, to the Savings Bank,
but there all demands were met in gold, and thus the
difficulties were allayed, and the excitement calmed.
The financial legislation included the Queensland
National Bank Agreement Bill, by which it was arranged
that the liabilities of the Bank as to deposits, etc.,
would be paid off by instalments, bearing interest at
On his return in March Sir Thomas took the
portfolio of Railways, Mr. Nelson becoming Treasurer,
and Mr. J. T. Byrnes, Attorney-General. Mr. A. H.
Barlow succeeded Mr. A. S. Cowley as Minister for
Lands, and Mr. Unmack retired from office, Mr. W.
H. Wilson succeeding him as Postmaster-General, while
the other department—that of Railways—which Mr.
Unrnack had administered, was taken over by Sir
Thomas. Mr. R. Philp took charge of the Departments of
Mines and Works, Mr. Lissner being defeated; while
Mr. H. Tozer became Colonial Secretary and Mr. A.
J. Thynne, Minister without portfolio. The general
elections which took place early in the year gave an
overwhelming majority for the Government, thirty-
eight Ministerialists being returned to Parliament, the
Opposition only numbering eight. There were eight


Independents, while tlie Labour members numbered
sixteen. Great dissatisfaction was aroused during the
general election at the large number of voters who were
struck off the rolls, no less than 15,000 being treated
in this way, the number of electors being reduced from
98,065 to 83,005. Parliament assembled in May, Mr.
A. S. Cowley being elected Speaker, Mr. .1. R. Dickson
declining the office.
A very important point occupied the attention of
Parliament early in the session, the question of the
trade of the Queensland border being diverted, or,
rather, attracted into New South Wales. To remedy
the loss sustained by the port of Brisbane the
Government introduced the Border Tax Bill, framed
for the purpose of causing the products of stations to
flow by means of the Queensland railway system to the
capital. This was a counter move to the tactics of New
South Wales in making a bid for the trade from the
Queensland border stations by reducing the rates on
the New South Wales railways. To the surprise of the
Ministry the border legislation was strenuously opposed
by Government supporters chiefly concerned, and whose
interests were affected. The antagonism to the Bill
was so strong that the measure was only carried by the
casting-vote of the Speaker, and, very rightly under the
circumstances, the Government resigned. As, however,
there was no hope of another Ministry taking form, the
resignation can only be deemed to have been a threat
and a declaration of independence, for as no member in
Opposition would undertake to form a Ministry, Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith withdrew his resignation, and things
went on as before.
Like the ghost of a past controversy the Robb
arbitration case arises in the minds of old settlers. The
claim, which was in connection with railway construc-
tion, represented an amount of £262,311, the award
being £20,807, while the total costs in the case were
£23,657, the law costs being £12,758, while fees to
experts, witnesses’ expenses, etc., totalled no less than
£10,899. Among the fees paid to Crown counsel were
two exceeding £2,000, for to Sir Samuel Griffith went
£2,778 and to Mr. T. J. Byrnes £2,968. Yet another
lawsuit which bulks yet more largely in the memory
of those days was the case instituted by the Queensland
Investment and Land Mortgage Company against S.
Grimley, E. R. Drury (general manager Q.N. Bank),
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, Sir A. H. Palmer, and F. H.
Hart. The Supreme Court gave a verdict in favour of
the defendants, and there was no appeal to the Privy
Council.
In 1893 there were three freezing works capable of
treating 400 cattle, or a corresponding number of sheep,
daily. There were also four tinning and five boiling-
down works, while two additional works were about to
be opened. Scope for the exportation of stock there
was surely, for it was reported that there were some
500,000 cattle and 2,000,000 sheep available for markets
overseas. The Meat and Dairy Produce Encouragement
Act, which became law in 1893, has done much by its
wise and liberal provisions. The measure imposed a
tax—up to 1897—at the rate of 15s. for every 100
cattle and Is. 6d. for every 100 sheep. The amounts
so raised were placed to the credit of the Meat Fund
and Dairy Fund, respectively. The former fund
received all moneys raised by taxation in respect of
cattle, which did not go to the credit of the Dairy Fund,
and all moneys received in respect of sheep. All so-
called dairy cattle were, as to taxation, in relation to
the Dairy Fund; all cattle, the property of an owner
who did not possess more than 100 head, were also
deemed to come under the Dairy Fund for the purposes
of the Act, as was also one-tenth of the amount received
in taxation of cattle other than those used for dairying.
The moneys received under the two forms of taxation
were advanced to the proprietors of meat and dairy
works, the distribution of the advances on loan being
based on the revenue received from the several districts
into which the Colony was divided. A board, comprising
the Minister for Agriculture and five other members,
representing as far as possible all of the districts inter-
ested, had control of the advances, which were only to
be made on the security of a mortgage of works and
machinery, interest to be at the rate of 5 per cent, and
full repayment was to be made in ten years. All
advances, it was provided, should be reported by the
Minister to Parliament. Such in very brief outline was
the nature of the legislation which has done more than
any other thing to advance by leaps and bounds the
linked industries of meat works and dairying, both of
which have done so much to stimulate progress and
induce prosperity. Those who formed the Meat and
Dairy Produce Encouragement Act builded better than
they knew.
In 1896 another meteorological disturbance threw
the wheels of business out of gear, and abnormal heat
again threatened floods. They came, but were preceded
by a cyclone, which literally devastated Townsville,
on January 6 and 27, for public buildings, hotels, and
houses were either wrecked or unroofed. It was in truth
a time of gales, attended by heavy seas on the coast
and continuous rain. So fierce was the storm that more
than 200 ft. of the massive breakwater at Townsville
was damaged, while steamers and lighters were either-
sunk or driven ashore. It had become the habit of the
Government Meteorologist to differentiate tropical dis-
turbances by name, and “Sigma” has a sinister memory
for old residents of Northern Queensland of those days,
and the sight or mention of the A.U.S.N. Company’s


steamer “Aramac” is ever a point in reminiscence of
the cyclone, for the vessel went ashore on Bramble Reef,
where she remained for ten hours, being then refloated
and all on board saved. “Sigma” at Townsville
resulted in no less than thirteen deaths. As may have
been gathered by previous records of pluvial visitations,
it was no uncommon thing for a flood to seemingly abate
its force, and thereafter gather strength again, and this
was the case at Townsville, for there were no less than
three floods in all on the occasion of which we write.
At Clermont bridges were washed away and the full
force of the flood experienced, while the Fitzroy and
Mary were “up.” In Brisbane the pressure of the flood
endangered and ultimately caused a portion of the tem-
porary wooden structure at Victoria Bridge to sink
ferry boat, variously placed at from sixty to 100. One
thing, alas, was soon known —there were twenty-
five deaths as the result of this terrible fatality. Here
and there were miraculous escapes, and the bright gleam
of heroism was thrown on what was otherwise the
darkest of pictures, for there was many a gallant act
of rescue and life-saving. In the main, however, the
danger of being swept down stream was appallingly great,
and we must wonder that the loss of life was not
greater than it was.
Turning to the political interests of the time, we
find things were then much as they are now. Mr. Charles
Powers, the Leader of the Opposition, in shaking the
dust of the Parliamentary arena from off his shoes, com-
plained bitterly of the selfish injustice of the Labour
THE EXECUTIVE BUILDINGS, BRISBANE.
some 4 feet. All traffic had before this been suspended,
communications between North and South Brisbane
being maintained by steam ferry, the “Pearl, a
steamer of some forty-one tons, being employed. In
the midst of work, seemingly carried on most efficiently,
there came a calamity with appalling suddenness, for
on February 13, when the vessel was crowded with
passengers returning from business, a fatal accident
occurred, the “Pearl” being swept by the wildly-flowing
current between the stern of the Normanby and the
bows of the “Lucinda,” and so across the anchor chains
of the latter vessel, which was the Government yacht.
In a moment the catastrophe came, and all on board
were precipitated into the water. It was somewhat
difficult to estimate the number of passengers on the
Executive in making a union with the Opposition
impossible, averring that while Labour insisted on
thirty-seven seats being held clear for itself, it was only
willing that nine should be retained for the Opposition.
There was, Mr. Powers asserted, no willingness on the
part of Labour to give an undertaking not to send
Labour candidates against those who came out in the
Opposition interests. It is exceedingly interesting to
note that in those days, nigh a quarter of a century ago,
Mr. Powers should have discriminated between the
Labour Executive, with whom he bracketed Mr. Glassey
and the Parliamentary Labour Party, blaming the
former.
The time had come for Sir Henry Norman to resign
the Governorship, and he and Lady Norman, with Miss


Norman, carried with them on their departure to Eng-
land the grandly-won regard and respect of all
Queenslanders. In London Sir Henry Norman con-
tinued to evince his interest in the Colony and to work
for it in the office of Agent-General, the duties of which
he assumed. Meanwhile Lord Lamington, a young
Scottish nobleman, who had already made his mark as
a man of affairs in the sphere of Imperial politics, had
arrived in Queensland, travelling via Torres Strait,
thus touching first at the centres of population in
Northern Queensland. Thursday Island was reached
on March 27, and the passage of the Queen’s repre-
sentative down the coast was veritably a triumphal
procession, the people of Queensland having seemingly
taken both Lord and Lady Lamington to their hearts.
In Brisbane the welcome accorded was of the warmest,
and 70,000 citizens assembled to witness the procession
of the vice-regal party through the city. The advent
of Lord Lamington was a prophecy of the cordial rela-
tions which were to attend the Governor’s stay in
Queensland.
Meanwhile, amid all the advance, or arrest of
prosperity, experienced by one Colony or another of
Australia, there was a steady movement onward towards
Federation. In this year it had come that the decision
of the Premiers in council concerning the choosing of
delegates to an intercolonial convention to draw up a
Federal Constitution failed to be put in practice. The
Federal Enabling Bill, as it was introduced into the
Queensland Parliament, did not, however, stand square
with the legislation on the subject of the other
Colonies, for the measure provided that the ten dele-
gates should be elected ‘by the Legislative Assembly
instead of by the people. It was urged in defence
of the course taken that a general election had lately
been completed, and that the Assembly being chosen
as the voting power obviated the expense of a further
appeal to the people. Another point soon arose as
the result of the action of the Lower House, for the
Legislative Council raised its voice. The Ministry had
been strong enough to carry the new system of voting
through the Assembly, for a motion by Mr. Curtis,
member for Rockhampton, in favour of a direct vote
by the electors was lost by 26 votes to 36. When,
however, the measure came before the Upper House the
councillors became clamant in their demand that they,
as well as the members of the Assembly, should have a
voice in the selection of the delegates, and the Bill was
amended accordingly. The Assembly stood firm, as did
the Government, the position being taken up that unless
Queensland was represented at the Convention on the
lines of the Bill it would not be represented at all, and
this, despite the fact that Mr. George Reid, Premier
of New South Wales, who had subsequently so much
to do with bringing about Federation, visited Brisbane
in an effort to move the Ministry to retire from its
position. His mediation was, however, unavailing, and
in November the Council laid the Bill aside.
Turning to a most important subject, that of land
settlement, we find that the demand for grazing farms
had largely increased during the year, no less than 289
being taken, representing an aggregate area of 2,014,055
acres. In addition there were selected 104 grazing
homesteads and 850 agricultural farms, or a total area
in agricultural land selection of 2,485,252 acres, divided
into 1,243 selections. This was the largest selection
in any one year since the introduction of the Act, and
yielded £20,000 per annum in revenue. Not in one
district only was the impetus to agricultural settlement
felt, for 1,200,000 acres of land in Hughenden, Long-
reach, Winton, and Cunnamulla were thrown open as
grazing farms, and 47,000 acres of land on stations in
which the leases had expired were made available as
agricultural farms iu the districts of Ipswich and
Toowoomba. Beyond that a district which rapidly came
into its own in regard to agriculture received a strong
stimulus, for 30,000 acres were thrown open to the
agricultural selectors in Nanango.
The legislations under the Agricultural Lands Pur-
chase Act of 1894 included six estates, the land of which
was opened to selection. Four of these estates were in
the Darling Downs District, while one was at Rosewood
and another at Beaudesert. The encouragement of the
man of small means, which the legislation of that day
represented, was highly approved, as is shown by the
fact that during the year 30,000 acres were made avail-
able for selection, the terms providing for twenty years’
payment at the rate of £7 12s. lOd. per cent. In
contradistinction to the eagerness which attended the
selection of land and the increase of the area under the
plough in many a district, it is of interest to note that
the socialistic ventures failed absolutely, for a sum of
£13,000 which had been advanced to co-operative
settlements by the Government was written off the public
accounts as a bad debt.
The swinging of the pendulum between floods and
droughts has always lent an element of uncertainty to
the industries which are especially dependent on rain,
with the proviso that there must not be too much of it.
Slowly is the lesson being learnt that where Nature fails,
or seems to fail, in supplying the necessary conditions,
her action is but to stimulate man through ingenuity
and energy to supply what is lacking. Much has been
done to modify weather conditions by artificial means,
and much had even been accomplished in the mid-
nineties; but a great deal then, as now, remained to


be done. Thus do we find that in the last months of
1896 the pastoral industry, which had so lately suffered
from too much moisture, now found the difficulty press-
ing on the other side. For seasons beneficent gave way
to dearth of rain, at first on the coast and then inland.
The owners of flocks and herds were also finding the
old problem assailing them anew. A market for surplus
stock had always been one of the questions which those
engaged in grazing in Australia had found most difficult
to solve. For a time freezing and chilling works had
seemed to answer the needs, but with exportation going
on busily there came a change. The price of meat in
England had fallen, that being the inevitable conse-
quence of widespread recourse to freezing in America
and in Australia. And stock-owners found that
with an unpropitious market and the heavy
charges for freezing the profits were sadly diminished.
to exert the utmost efforts to check effectually the evil,
even if it could not be extirpated, for cattle by tens
of thousands were swept away by tick fever. Parliament
came to the aid of the suffering stock-owners, and the
Colony was divided into three zones, the southern
boundaries of which being, respectively, the 21st and
24th degree of latitude, and in the most southerly zone
the border of New South Wales. Legislation passed on
the subject provided that in the northerly zone there
was to be no passage therefrom for cattle or horses,
while the central and infected areas were proclaimed,
and the travelling of stock from one infected area to
another was forbidden, except in the case where it was
purposed to slaughter the stock in the zone. In the
southern zone it was ordered that there should be a
close inspection of all stock routes, while dipping was
to be carried out when necessary. Dipping, indeed,
CITY REACH, BRISBANE RIVER.
Not alone, however, did the questions of supply
and demand occupy the interests and increase the
anxieties of the pastoralists, for there had come another
menace, that of a veritable plague of ticks. Whether
the terribly fatal disease induced by ticks was identical
with "Texas fever,” a scourge which affected stock in
the United States, is a question which the medical
scientists alone could decide. Be the fact as to origin
what it may, inquiry showed that the disease had pre-
vailed in the northern portion of the Colony, especially
in the Gulf Country, and as far south as the Tropic of
Capricorn, for some eighteen years. In 1894 the ravages
wrought by ticks increased to an extent that justified
the most serious alarm on the part of stock-owners. And
the menace grew until its widespread prevalence two
years later aroused Government and pastoralists alike
was the final preventive in all cases. Despite every pre-
caution some herds were exterminated by the ticks.
One must do justice to both Government and Parliament
in the energy devoted to the work of preserving stock.
Dr. Hunt and Mr. W. Collins were despatched to the
United States to make full investigations of the pest
and the best means of combating its ravages. Both did
their work well, and the meetings held on their return to
the Colony were most fruitful. Both were enthusiastic,
and imparted the information they had acquired in
plain language pruned of all technicalities, so that in
the various districts stock-owners were placed in pos-
session of facts in relation to the institution of dips
and methods to be adopted in dipping in oil. The diffi-
culties encountered were enormous, when it is stated
that no less than 40,000 ticks were found on one animal;


that stock were not rendered immune by one attack, but
were subject to a return of tick fever. And again the
question was still further complicated by the fear that
infection could be spread by ticks remaining in hides
sent south for shipment. This source of danger was,
however, averted to a great extent by the discovery
that a process of dry salting of the hides was an effectual
preventive. It is gratifying to know that the energetic
efforts made by the Queensland Government in staying
the ravages of the disease were fully recognized in the
Southern Colonies. The toll taken of the pastoral
industry may be imagined with the resulting arrest of
progress and development. It is of interest to note that
the State Conference convened at Sydney to consider the
tick pest, called attention to the wastefulness adopted in
the system then prevailing in regard to branding cattle
on parts of the hide most valuable to the leather
industry, for it was stated that no less than £300,000
per annum was lost through carelessness in that respect.
As it was with the pastoral industry so was it also
with the most important phase of agriculture in the
Colony —sugar-planting. For just as there was hope
that the coming crop would reach 100,000 tons
of sugar, there came that which bore tire same relation
to sugar-farming as did the tick pest to the pastoral
industry. Grubs, the product of cane-beetles, appeared
in the North and caused great ravages in three lead-
ing sugar-producing districts in the tropics, Johnstone,
Herbert, and Mackay. Organized and co-operative
efforts were made to destroy the beetles, the origin of
the mischief, a specified price being paid for their col-
lection, which became for the time a trade. No less
than fifty tons of beetles were destroyed during the year
in the districts mentioned, and perhaps no clearer evi-
dence of the magnitude or the gravity of the pest could be
afforded. And yet the industry, perchance because it had
reached a stage where nothing could arrest its advance,
displayed great vigour, due no doubt to the wise
adoption of the best methods of encouragement in the
Sugar Works Guarantee Act introduced some three
years previously by Sir Hugh Nelson when Premier.
Already there were two central co-operative mills erected
under the Act, while arrangements were approved for
advances under the Legislative measure for the purpose of
building seven other sugar works. All the sugar mills,
we are told, paid at least 255. per ton profit. Beyond
that, the price paid by refineries exceeded £1 per ton that
paid during the preceding year. In considering the pro-
spects and results of cane-growing at this time, it must
be remembered that when the demand of Queensland for
sugar was overtaken the growers were thrown on the
open market of the world, for Federation had not yet
unified the Customs relations of the Australian Colonies,
and New South Wales and her sisters in the South stood
on the same plane to Queensland regarding Customs
charges as did the United Kingdom or foreign
countries. Experience, first at Bundaberg, but sub-
sequently in the Mackay district and elsewhere,
proved that cane-growing could be admirably com-
bined with dairy farming, and as a result a strong
impetus was given to dairying in those districts suitable
for sugar-growing. Nothing could have been more
advantageous to the Colony than the discovery that
sugar-growing and dairying could well be carried on in
conjunction.
On the face of facts elsewhere in the world, tobacco-
growing should have been an industry eminently suitable
to the tropical North, if not- to Queensland as a whole.
Experience, however, as it was from the earliest settle-
ment of the Mother Colony, seems to be against the
suitability of soil and climatic conditions to produce
tobacco at its best. This must be acknowledged when
we remember that almost from the first days of settle-
ment shepherds in the distant bush were wont to grow
tobacco to supply their own needs. Had the leaf been
excellent, nay, had it been passably good, it cannot be
doubted but that energy and enterprise would have
embarked on the industry, and made it that success
which favouring natural circumstances have made sugar-
growing in Queensland. As it was in regard to cotton
cultivation, so might one think it was also in connection
with tobacco-planting. There were always too many
apologies for failure to reach the deserved success,
always too many explanations why tobacco did not take
root as one of the best of the Colony’s cultural staples.
The public were told the tropical North could pro-
duce a cigar-leaf equal to Cuba or Sumatra, and in
proof of the assertion cigars were sometimes distributed
freely. But there was no fast-growing demand for the
article, and, most ominous test of all, smokers did not
seek, and seemed rather disappointed when they obtained
colonial tobacco. In the year 1896 there was a
marked diminution in those devoting themselves to the
industry, for only 397 growers were registered, compared
with 493 in the previous year. Somewhat ambiguous
is the statement made in contemporaneous records that
the Queensland market had been overtaken two years
previously.
The year 1896 was uneventful in the main, and there
was neither industrial trouble nor unemployment experi-
enced during its course. Turning to a very important
asset of the Colony, its mining resources, it may be
noted in the summing up of the year’s work that the
gold yield gave nothing phenomenal; in fact the
returns, some 621,000 oz., were 10,000 oz. less than
the previous year. It may be that this result was


due to (the diminution by some hundreds in the number
of prospectors, who were drawn to Western Australia
by the counter attractions there. Despite this fact the
alluvial prospects were good at Clermont and at the
Etheridge, while the reduction of royalty on the use of
the cyanide process stimulated what may be termed the
science of quartz-mining through the utilization of low-
grade ores and the treatment of large supplies of tailings.
A vote of £IO,OOO by Parliament in aid of deep sinking
also pointed hopefully to the future, but reading between
the lines one can see that during the year gold-mining
was below normal.
The year of the financial crisis, 1893, did not bring
an end to banking difficulties, and for the Queensland
National Bank there were anxious times ahead. The
anxiety reached a climax in 1896, for the meeting in July
of the Bank directors showed that the forebodings had
been well founded, and as a result of the deliberations it
was decided that a rearrangement of the terms with the
Government was necessary. In the interests of the
Colony as a whole, and in view of the fact that those
then controlling the institution could not be deemed
responsible for the heritage of the past, the Government
and Parliament alike showed an earnest desire to assist
the Bank authorities to the utmost of their power. A
Committee of Investigation was appointed with plenary
powers. In November the committee, which comprised
Messrs. E. B. Forrest, John Cameron, and E. V. Reid,
together with the Auditor-General, presented its
report, which showed that there was still a deficit of
£1,252,810, while the unproductive advances, including
the deficit, were calculated at £3,000,000. As far as
the interests of the shareholders were concerned, the
Bank was found to be hopelessly insolvent. Yet one
must hasten to add—the fact was also found by the Com-
mittee of Investigation—that the transactions of the
institution represented a good volume of sound and
profitable business. In this latter fact lay the hope
that there might be a means of outlet from the diffi-
culties through a rearrangement. The object of the
Government and Banking authorities alike was so to
strengthen the institution that it would stem the stormy
weather ahead. Obviously the best buttress the Bank
could receive was a Government guarantee of the
balances at credit of current account temporarily,
together with the new fixed deposits which might mature
'during the period of reconstruction, for it had been
calculated that on the line of business then pursued the
deficit might be extinguished in some twelve or fourteen
years. Thus came it that a Bill was urgently passed
through Parliament, the realization of the necessity for
action being shown by the vote in the Assembly, where
the second reading was carried by 55 votes to 6. The
price of tlie Labour Party’s assent to the measure had
been plainly set forth. It was that a full investigation
should be made into the management of the institution
since it had been a Government Bank. That pledge
was given by the Ministry, perhaps to the surprise of
some people. The measure set forth that the Govern-
ment guarantee should not exceed £BOO,OOO, and extend
to twelve months. Then followed a week later the
Queensland National Bank Limited (Agreement) Act,
which was passed by 44 votes to 21, an amendment by
Mr. Drake that the reading be postponed to “this day
six months’’ being negatived by 52 votes to 13. The
chief provisions of the Act were: —That repayment of
monies owing to the Government be made not later
than July 1, 1921, and that the minimum rate of interest
be 2-| per cent. The Upper House assented to the Bill,
which became law. It may be noted in passing that
a provision existed in the measure to extend the
repayment of Government money to 1931, but in the
Assembly the period was reduced by ten years.
A year later there came a celebration that was at
once a retrospect and a prophecy, for the commemor-
ation of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria’s
reign in 1897, coming as it did before events which were
of momentous import to Australia and the Empire as
a whole, is worthy of record. And, after all, there
was surely never a more propitious forthcoming of the
Empire’s strength in unity of the Motherland with her
Dominions’ daughters, “her daughter queens,” as Kip-
ling had it, than was set forth in the Diamond Jubilee
celebrations in London. The Diamond Jubilee,
by the wise ordering of the venerable Queen,
showed for the first time the military power
of the Dominions, marching side by side with the
Imperial troops, and giving a new meaning to the
term. For surely nothing could be more significant
than the fact that in the procession the military forces
of the Colonies should have been represented. Led by
Lord Roberts of Kandahar, who was ere long to show
that in South Africa, as elsewhere, the unity of the
Empire was inviolable, the marshalled pageantry of
warriors from all parts of the Empire was surely the
promise of that which was to be. Four years comrade-
ship in war in defence of the Empire was to cement
for all time that which the Diamond Jubilee first drew
together. Not alone in the marshalling of the military
might of the Empire were the celebrations a prophecy,
for on June 18 the Prince of Wales—who ascended
the throne ere long as Edward Vll.—welcomed the
representatives of Greater Britain at a banquet given
at the Imperial Institute, where there assembled one-
time vice-regal representatives and agents-general,
together with many a notable statesman of the United
Kingdom and Dominions overseas.


CHAPTER XXX.
THE WELDING AND THE SHAPING OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
It was not long ere that which had been wrought
through all the national growth and had found such well-
defined outline in the latest celebrations of Victoria’s
glorious reign was to be thrown across the sky like the
reflection of a conflagration. It was a fire—the fire of
patriotism —and all the Dominions were aglow with it.
The world wondered, as well it might, for never before
had been tested the links in the Imperial armour. How
much was proved on the anvil of the gods, when the
patience of the Empire broke down at the insolence of
injustice and the flaunting of wrong-doing in far away
Pretoria! Kruger miscalculated the power of the
Empire, because he was unconscious of its unity.
With the tidings of the Empire’s need came Aus-
tralia’s answer, and it is with honest pride that Queens-
landers remember Sir J. R. Dickson, who offered the
military services of the Colony. From that day
Australia knew herself—her sons knew themselves—for
a common danger had awakened them to the brother-
hood of Britons. From every part of Queensland our
soldiers poured forth and went to help the Motherland
in her time of need.
It is an assertion somewhat paradoxical, but the
decentralization of the Australian Colonies was really
the cause of the movement for Federal relations. The
independence for which each territory had fought so
assiduously proved inconvenient and irksome, and as
the Colonies waxed stronger, as their population grew
and their interests extended, circumstances called for
*
closer relations, something which would avert that which
was beginning to be felt by all as a drag on progress,
but which for many years had engaged the attention of
the most thoughtful men in Australia. The differing
and antagonistic Customs duties between Colonies whose
interests and aims were one, were felt to be an
anachronism and the contradiction of good government
and common-sense institutions. Postal communication
was affected adversely, and there were many laws—those
of naturalization may serve as an example—in regard to
which there was felt to be a pressing need for unifica-
tion. In one important particular more than anything
else was the necessity for a point of unity realized, and
the march of events was destined to render the argument
irrefutable. Sir Edward Braddon, Premier of Tas-
mania, when in London at the Diamond Jubilee
celebrations, emphasized the great need of the Aus-
tralian Colonies in stating that 30,000 men had been
embodied for the defence of the Island Continent, and
their numbers, he held, could be indefinitely extended
if the occasion arose. In defence more than aught else
there was the necessity for a central control and
authority. Away back in the forties, as early
indeed as 1846, it was realized that decentraliza-
tion in the institution of rival Colonies and settle-
ments represented an evil that should be remedied.
Again, when Port Phillip, three years later, found
herself strong enough for the great adventure of
autonomy, circumstances to the watchful gave warning
that a hub to the colonial wheel was required. Not
only did the question recur again and again to those
in Australia who were statesmen by instinct, but also
the same line of thought had occurred to men high
in the councils of their Sovereign, and we find the
Secretary of State for the Colonies (Earl Grey) formu-
lating what was in truth a well-digested scheme for a
central legislature very similar to that which took place
subsequently under Commonwealth relations, and which
could deal with questions of general interests as com-
pared with business domestic to the various Colonies.
More than that, to complete the resemblance to the
later-day system, Earl Grey’s proposals provided for a
Governor-General, and what he termed a General
Assembly. The Select Committee of the Imperial Par-
liament appointed to consider the separation of Port
Phillip from New South Wales, and to whom Earl Grey
submitted his scheme, obviously thought it impracticable,
for they gave no attention to the proposals.
Nine years later Mr. Wentworth, whose statecraft
did much to advance the Mother Colony, became pos-
sessed of the Federal ideal, and drew up a Bill setting
forth a practical system of action which he duly
submitted to the Imperial authorities. Nothing, how-
ever, resulted. But to the efforts of Sir Henry
Parkes, and later to the legal genius of Sir Samuel
Griffith, Federation owed its success in the main.
For as early as 1867 did the great leader of political
thought in Australia turn the indomitable forces of his
mind towards the making of Federation. Onward from
that period did he work, deadening obstruction of other
and selfish interests; all the time was he delving and
digging, but it was not until the institution of the
Federal Council as a means to an end—and not the end,
as it appeared to shallower minds—that success rose
above the horizon.
All that Sir Henry Parkes sought was already his
potentially, when in a note to a Premiers’ Convention
in 1881 he defined the object of organization, and of
the Federal Council itself, as “the means whereby men
might be led to think in the direction of Federation.”
It gives one an admirable idea of the importance of
Federation to Sir Henry Parkes when we realize that
the Federal Council, with all the legislative pomp and

circumstance of its coming, all the paraphernalia of its
uses, was simply to be a picture of Federation in the
minds of all Australians, a picture in full view of their
mental vision. Had the prescience vouchsafed to Sir
Henry Parkes been possessed by long bygone advocates
of Commonwealth relations, Federation might have been
accomplished forty years before it took form. Prescience
on the subject Sir Henry Parkes assuredly had. How
can we otherwise account for his assertion in 1867 that
he saw Australia as a constellation of six stars?
From 1889 onward there were conventions and
conferences, but always something here or there
touched the tender susceptibilities of one Colony
or another. Sir Henry Parkes was not to see the
realization of his hopes, and he passed, full of years
Mr. G. H. Reid, who at that time held the
reins of power in New South Wales, was warm
in the cause, and in 1895 the Enabling Bill was
approved by the Premiers of the Colonies in council
at Hobart. On this occasion Queensland barred
the way, as we have elsewhere said, in the reading which
the Government chose to give of one of the conditions,
popular election. And Queensland withdrew. Yet
something, nay much was done, for all the other
Colonies, in four Conventions, where each territory was
represented by ten members, agreed to the draft Bill
for the Constitution of a Commonwealth of Australia.
The Conventions took place in 1897 and 1898, being
held at Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne, the last two
Conferences being held at Melbourne. Then followed a

and rich in the admiring regard of his fellow-citizens.
In Mr. Barton, however, the Federal interests found
an able champion, and New South Wales rallied her
forces. What Sir Henry Parkes had hoped for in the
institution of the Federal Council, the education of the
people in regard to the need for a unifying organism,
that Mr. Barton found in local Federation Leagues.
At length, in 1893, something practical and definite was
attained, for in a convention of such leagues held at
Corowa, Victoria, Sir John Quick succeeded in winning
approval for a Federal scheme in the form of a proposal
that all the Colonies should pass Enabling Bills
authorizing a new Convention, the membership of which
should be by popular election. The work of the Con-
vention, it was decided, should be the framing of a
Federal Constitution, which it was proposed in turn to
submit to a referendum.
r 2
referendum in four of the Colonies, the result of which
was as follows;
Again there was disappointment, for the in-
sufficient majority in New South Wales barred the
way. Yet that for which Sir Henry Parkes had
planned had come. The people knew now, and took a
keen interest in the issues. Even in New South Wales
opinion changed, as was shown by the general
election which took place, and the vote of which was
directed by views on Federation, the constituencies show-
ing themselves in favour of the movement. There was


more than enough to justify the continuing of efforts to
bring about Commonwealth relations.
Foremost among the advocates of Federation had
been Sir Samuel Griffith, who bent all the great power
of his mind, and utilized his no less extended political
experience and knowledge of constitutional law in
furtherance of the movement. What Sir Samuel Griffith
did before the accomplishment of Commonwealth rela-
tions, both in his capacity as a legislator and Premier,
had no doubt very great influence in moulding public
opinion in the Colony. What he did subsequently in the
giving of his best thoughts and the rendering of un-
stinted service to the Commonwealth, his work and
Federated Australia testify. In the Convention held in
Sydney in 1891 Sir Samuel Griffith was one of the repre-
sentatives of Queensland, and was chosen vice-president
of the assemblage, having for his colleagues from the
north Sir T. Mcllwraith and Messrs. J. Donaldson,
Macdonald-Paterson, A. Rutledge, A. J. Thynne, and
J. Macrossan. While all did yeoman service in working
for Federation, it was to Sir Samuel Griffith, in an
especial manner, that Australia is indebted for the
framing of the Commonwealth Bill as eventually sub-
mitted to the electors in referendum.
On January 28, 1899, the Premiers in con-
ference at Melbourne accomplished their work, in
which Mr. J. R. Dickson, the Premier of Queens-
land, took part. A great step forward had, indeed,
been takenf- for the Conference decided that a stage
had been reached when no further conventions need
be held, all that was now required being the acceptance
of the Commonwealth Bill with as few amendments as
possible. The amendments approved were, however,
very important, one of the subjects, finance, arousing
such strong feeling that the very existence of the Bill
was endangered. Ultimately, after discussion which con-
tinued for three days, it was decided that a simple
majority of the members be substituted for a three-
fourths majority in those cases where the two Houses of
Parliament sat together, while in regard to financial
affairs, what was known as the Braddon blot, or clause,
was limited as to its operations to ten years, the clause in
question providing that not more than one-fourth of the
duties raised by Customs and excise were to be devoted
to Federal purposes. Yet further important amend-
ments in matters of vital moment provided that the
capital should be in Federal territory, relinquished by
New South Wales, and not nearer to Sydney than 100
miles, while the first Federal Parliament should be held
in Melbourne. It was also decided that prior to an
appeal to the people in the other Colonies, the Com-
monwealth Bill in its amended form should be submitted
to the people of New South Wales in referendum. In
the passage of the measure through the Parliament of
New South Wales on April 10 it was decided that
Queensland must be one of two other Colonies, besides
New South Wales, giving assent to Federation before
an address to the Crown could be adopted. It was
further agreed, after a strong struggle, that a majority
of one-fourth in the referenda was necessary for the
validation of the measure. On June 20 the referendum
was taken in New South Wales, the people affirming
that Federation was desirable. It is of interest,
perhaps, to note that on the same day the Enabling
Bill became law in Queensland. During the next ten
weeks the people in Queensland thought Federation and
talked Federation. To a great extent the barriers of
politics were broken down, and partisans otherwise keenly
opposed fought strenuously alongside of each other.
New South Wales and Victoria had reached the Com-
monwealth haven, the referenda there having spoken in
favour of Federal relations, and so Mr. Barton from
the former Colony and Mr. Deakin from the latter came
to Queensland, taking part in the campaign. In the
North the hopes of the separationists, or rather of the
old-time sugar party, for a while ran high; but very
soon they found that all minor interests had become
unimportant compared to that of chanqhoning Common-
wealth relations. On September 2 came a day, vivid in
memories for all who took part in it. The voting in
Queensland was 38,488 for Federation and 30,996
against, a majority of 7,492 for Commonwealth rela-
tions. So the people spoke. Then followed action in
Parliament, praying the Queen that the Imperial Legis-
lature might take the necessary action. The petition
was carried in the Legislative Assembly on October 4
by 57 votes to 10, great enthusiasm being displayed.
Six days later the Upper House approved, after an
amendment by Mr. Barlow—for the insertion in the
petition of a statement that the question had not been
fully and fairly before the electors—had been negatived
by 17 votes to 10. Another amendment by Dr. Taylor,
giving the Imperial Parliament permission to amend the
Bill in the manner deemed best, was turned down by
16 votes to 9, the figures which represented the approval
of the petition to the Queen on the part of the Legis-
lative Councillors.
No more succinct delineation of the leading points
of the Commonwealth Bill could be found than is given
in "Pugh’s Almanac” for 1900, and we gladly draw on
it foi information. The valuable publication in question
says:—‘‘The Federal Parliament will consist of a
Senate and a House of Representatives, both elected on
the principle of one man one vote, and in the case of
South Australia one adult one vote, women having votes
there. The Federal Parliament will subsequently make
a uniform suffrage of its own. The House of Repre-
sentatives will be elected by the several Colonies according


to population, the proportion being one member to
between 50,000 and 60,000 voters, and no State will
have less than five members. According to latest
statistics this would give New South Wales 26 members,
Victoria 23, Queensland 10, South Australia 7, and
Tasmania and Western Australia 5 each; total, 76. The
Senate will consist of six members from each State
which adopts the Constitution from the start. The
representatives of any Colony joining afterwards will be
a matter of arrangement. The Federal Parliament can
only exercise the powers expressly conferred upon it by
the Constitution, the chief matters remitted to it being
defence, banking and currency, light-houses, fisheries,
taxation for Commonwealth
purposes, borrowing money,
foreign and interstate trade
and commerce, navigation
and shipping, post and tele-
graph services, quarantine,
bankruptcy, immigration and
emigration, alien labour.
Within two years from com-
ing into existence the Com-
monwealth must establish a
uniform tariff upon which
all intercolonial duties will
cease, thus providing abso-
lute freetrade between the
various States. The Execu-
tive will consist of a Gov-
ernor-General with a salary
of £lO,OOO per annum; a
Council of not more than
seven members, whose sal-
aries must not exceed
£12,000 per year, and they
must be members of one or
other House of Parliament.
Ministers of both Houses will
be paid £4OO a year. Civil
servants will preserve all
their existing rights as to salaries, pensions, gratuities,
etc. A High Court of Justice is to be established, con-
sisting of a Chief Justice and not less that two Judges,
who will also constitute a Court of General Appeal from
the Supreme Courts of the States. The decision is to be
final in all cases involving the interpretation of the
Federal Constitution, or the Constitution of the States,
unless Imperial interests are involved. The Interstate
Commission will have jurisdiction over railways, rivers,
and other channels of Interstate trade, but their deci-
sions are subject to appeal to the High Court on
questions of law only. The Constitution may be amended
by referendum, but any amendment must be agreed to
by a majority of the electors voting and also by a
majority of the States. Provision is also made for the
division of States.”
As the majority of the people spoke in Queensland,
so also were the wishes of the electors expressed in the
other Colonies . The voting was as follows: —New
South Wales—For the Bill, 107,420; against, 82,741;
majority in favour, 24,679. Victoria—For, 152,653;
against, 9,805; majority, 142,848. South Australia—
For, 65,990; against, 17,053; majority, 48,937. Western
Australia —For, 44,800; against, 19,691; majority,
25,109. Tasmania—For, 13,437; against, 791; majority,
12,646. The grand totals of the referendum vote, inclu-
sive of that of Queensland,
previously given, were:
For the Bill, 422,788
against, 161,077; majority
for Federation, 261,711.
So far the Australian
Colonies had don© their
part. All that really mat-
tered had been brought to a
successful issue, but in the
making of the Common-
wealth, as of other Domin-
ions overseas, it had been
wisely enacted that the all-
important stages should be
hedged in by formalities,
which to the careless and
unthinking might mean little
enough } but to the thought-
ful stood not only for pru-
dent safeguards against
hasty action, but beyond,
for the emphasizing of the
unity of the Empire. In the
early days of Australian col-
onization we have found
that the settlers were wont
to avail themselves to
the full of their right to petition the Queen, and now, in
the consummation of the Commonwealth, it came that
the time-honoured procedure was again adopted. In
Queensland we have seen that the necessary petition
to Her Majesty had been approved by Parliament, and
similar action was taken in the other Colonies. More
than that, however, was deemed necessary, and Vic-
toria was in the van of the movement, very practical
and necessary, to send delegates to London for the
purpose' of putting forward Australia’s views and assist-
ing the passage of the Commonwealth Bill through the
Imperial Legislature. Mr. Ueakin was the delegate
chosen by Victoria, and the prompitude with
SIR J. R DICKSON.


which the appointment was made gave extreme
umbrage to New South Wales, where the embers
of intercolonial jealousy flared up, the opinion
being expressed that the Mother Colony should
have been consulted previous to taking action.
Oil was subsequently poured on the troubled waters
by the decision of the various Premiers that each Colony
should choose its own delegates. As a result, Mr. J.
R. Dickson, Premier of Queensland, was selected to
represent that Colony in London, while the following
gentlemen were appointed as delegates by the other
parties to the Federal arrangement:- —Mr. Barton, New
South Wales; Mr. Deakin, Victoria; Mr. Kingston,
South Australia; Sir P. Fysh, Tasmania; and Mr. S.
H. Parker, Western Australia. Mr. W. P. Reeves, of
New Zealand, also went to London as a delegate, the
intention of New Zealand being to secure such an
amendment of the Commonwealth Bill as would open the
way for the entrance into the Federation of Colonies of
Australasia other than those of the Commonwealth.
New Zealand, in short, aimed at the extension of Federal
relations to the extent provided for in the Federal
Council Act. After deliberation with Mr. Chamberlain,
the Imperial Minister, who above all others showed him-
self at one with the aspirations and requirements of
Greater Britain, the proposals of New Zealand were
modified.
The first reading of the Bill, which was introduced
by Mr. Chamberlain, was carried in the House of
Commons amid great enthusiasm, although the question
of the appellate jurisdiction of the Privy Council
threatened to be as a lion in the path of legislation.
Queensland took up the position, in which she was
supported by Western Australia, that as the majority
of the members of the Queensland Parliament had
approved of the appeal system, it would be necessary to
obtain the consent of that Legislature to alterations, it
being held that a clause to secure the expression of
opinion from the colonial Parliament must be inserted.
Here there threatened to arise a serious cause of delay,
yet the contention of Queensland was cogent and well
founded, so much so, that although the attitude taken
aroused great antagonism among the Colonies, other
than Queensland and Western Australia, by xeason of the
delay the action would involve, yet the position must
have been logically sound, for Mr. Chamberlain recast
the amending clause in a form that removed all cause
for criticism or objection, and at the same time obviated
the convening of a meeting of the Australian Premiers
to consider and make recommendations to the Imperial
Government, which was the only alternative to a course
involving extreme delay. Under the alteration made,
the Australian High Court, without raising the question
as to the finality of its judgments on Australian con-
stitutional questions may, when a special reason exists,
grant a certificate affirming that in any given case it
has decided there should be a final judgment by the
Privy Council. Hence it will be seen that the opposition
of Queensland was of great value, as it obviated applic-
ation to the Privy Council for leave to appeal. The
remodelled clause, which afforded one more sign of the
whole-hearted earnestness of Mr. Chamberlain in aiding
Australia to the utmost extent of his power was fully
approved by all the colonial delegates then in London.
It is further of great interest to Australians to learn
that on his own initiative Mr. Chamberlain secured
action by the Imperial Ministry for the appointment of
four Lords of Appeal, to be paid by the Imperial
Government, who should be life peers, and should repre-
sent Canada, India, South Africa, and Australia.
All had been done that could contribute to the
epoch-making work. After being read a third time in
the House of Commons, the Commonwealth Bill was
considered by the Peers and passed through the Upper
House without change. In looking at the consummation
of Federal relations, and all they stand for to Australia
and the Empire, it is fitting that the part the venerable
Queen took in the constitution of the Commonwealth
should be remembered. As a constitutional sovereign
under a democracy slowly, but surely, built up, Queen
Victoria could do little directly to assist the movement,
but it was not unknown at the time that every step in
the Federation had for her the keenest interest.
Amid all the warring elements of European politics
Queen Victoria saw how Dominion added to Dominion
overseas would strengthen the Empire, and one cannot
but remember that the Royal assent to the Common-
wealth Bill was one of the last acts of a Queen who was
great but no less good, and had a royal mother-heart for
all the people over whose destinies she presided.
In view of that passing of the Queen, which was to
follow so speedily the rejoicings in Australia at the
Constitution of the Commonwealth, one can almost
believe that the aged monarch had a prescience of that
which was coming so soon when she prepared mementoes
of Federation and her part in it by signing in duplicate
her commission for assent to the Bill. That duplicate,
together with the pen and ink used on the occasion, and
the table on which she wrote, the Royal lady presented
to the Commonwealth. These Royal mementoes of
the Federation of Australia should be to us a glory and
a warning. They symbolize the unity of the Empire,
and are a token that with the institution of the Common-
wealth there came, as it had never come before, the
consciousness of that unity, the larger Federation of
which our Commonwealth relations are a figure.


Yet another thoughtful provision of the Queen for
Australia lived after her. Her advisers, true to their
trust, had done well in recommending the Earl of
Hopetoun as the first Viceroy of the Commonwealth, the
Governor-General of Australia. The choice of Lord
Hopetoun could not have been bettered, for the Queen’s
representative was a man after the heart of Australians.
A manly man, a lover of sport, one whose family, like
himself, had made the honours of the hunting field
not the least of their ambitions, Lord Hopetoun was
just able to touch the heart-chords’ of Australia, for he
loved horses, and the camaraderie of sport was to him
something very real. It is pleasing to remember, that in
accorded a welcome prophetic of the cordial relations to
be established between himself and Australians. Sydney
was en fete for the occasion, and a notable feature of the
reception festivities was a naval review. Following on
the arrival of the Queen’s representative there came a
body of Imperial troops to Australia, 1,200 strong,
representative of various regiments and branches of
the service.
With the first day of the new year, 1901, the
Federal Constitution Act came into operation, and Com-
monwealth relations commenced. The celebrations
in Brisbane, as in all the other capital cities of the great
Continent of the South, were enthusiastic in their
STONE QUARRIES, YANGAN, DARLING DOWNS.
an especial manner did he love Queensland, finding in
the North a place where health might be recuperated and
the worries of vice-regal life for a time forgotten. To
the Queen also must be traced the happy thought of
sending the heir of her family with his Duchess in a
royal progress to Australia, in order to personally open
the Commonwealth Parliament.
During the closing months of the year all thought
was centred on Federation, and it might truly be said
that State politics became temporarily—if very tempor-
arily —unimportant. On December 10 the Governor-Gen-
eral the Earl of Hopetoun, arrived in Australia, and was
fervour. Little though! was there that hardly would the
echo of the joy-bells die away ere through the whole of
Australia there should be a bowing of the head at the
passing of a monarch who had endeared herself to her
subjects by the virtues of her motherhood, the sanctities
of her domestic relations, as much as the power of her
intellect and the dominating influence her wisdom
exercised in European politics. Yet it was so, for on
January 22, after but a short illness, Queen Victoria
died. All knew that the Federation of Australia had
been with her a personal question, and throughout the
Commonwealth there was deep mourning.


CHAPTER XXXI.
FEDERAL ELECTIONS AND FIRST COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENT.
It had been feared that the death of the Queen
would bar the intended visit of her grandson and his
consort to Australia, but amid his grief King Edward
VII. had time to think of his people overseas, and so it
was decided that the lloyal progress should be made.
The lloyal party sailed from London in the
“Ophir,” one of the great Orient fleet, which was con-
verted into a Royal yacht for the occasion, on March 16,
a naval escort being furnished by H.M. ships “Juno’
and “St. George.” The lloyal party arrived in Mel-
bourne on May 4, 1901.
The first Commonwealth Government was composed
of gentlemen who could truly be considered the flower of
Australian statesmen at that time. Sir Edmund Bar-
ton, of New South Wales, who subsequently adorned the
judicature of the High Court, was Prime Minister, hold-
ing also the office of Minister for External Affairs; Mr.
Alfred Deakin, of Victoria, was Attorney-General; while
to Sir William Lyne, of New South Wales, was given the
portfolio of the Home Department. Sir George Turner,
of Victoria, became Treasurer; Mr. C. C. Kingston,
Minister for Trade and Customs; and Sir John Forrest,
of Western Australia, was Postmaster-General. Sir
James Robert Dickson, whose career in Queensland
political life and as Leader of the Government, no less
than his keen interest in Federation, together with
his knowledge of affairs, eminently qualified him for a
place in the Commonwealth Cabinet, became Minister
for Defence. Not for long, however, was the
honour held, for death came to the veteran political
leader on January 10. Thereafter Sir John Forrest
exchanged his portfolio of Postmaster-General for the
Department of Defence, Mr. J. G. Drake, of Queens-
land, becoming Postmaster-General. Mr. G. H. Reid,
of New South Wales, was the Leader of the Opposition.
It is interesting to note that at the Common-
wealth elections the following were the success-
ful candidates for the Senate in representation
of Queensland: —Dawson (L.), 29,489; Higgs (L.),
29,346; Drake (M.), 26,700; Stewart (L.), 23,865;
Ferguson (M.), 23,233; Glassey (I.O.), 22,737; Thynne,
22,107; Bartholomew, 20,710; Hamilton, 18,530;
Cowley, 18,472; Plant, 17,135; Murray-Prior, 12,999;
Hoolan, 7,463; Seymour, 4,995; Ahearne, 4,542;
Buzacott, 2,575. The following were elected members of
the House of Representatives:—Brisbane Division, T.
Macdonald-Paterson; Darling Downs Division, W. H.
Groom; Moreton Division, J. Wilkinson; Oxley Divi-
sion, R. Edwards; Wide Bay Division, A. Fisher;
Capricornia Division, A. Paterson; Herbert Division,
F. W. Bamford; Maranoa Division, J. Page; Kennedy
Division, C. McDonald. There were fifteen candidates
for the Senate and twenty-three for the House of Repre-
sentatives. Of the latter ten were Ministerialists, ten
Labourites, and three Independent Oppositionists.
May 9, 1901, was a memorable day, the outlook
of Australia being focussed on the Exhibition Building,
Melbourne, where the ceremonials in the opening of
the Commonwealth Parliament were performed. Prayer
by the Governor-General, with the singing of the 100th
Psalm, fittingly introduced a solemnly great event, the
like of which will never be experienced again in Aus-
tralia, and after Mr. Blackmore, the Clerk of Parliament,
had read the proclamation of His Majesty Edward VII.,
the heir to the throne, the Duke of Cornwall and York,
delivered his speech in opening the Federal Legislature,
concluding by declaring in the name of his father the
King that the Parliament of the Commonwealth was
now opened. The blare of trumpets and a royal salute
announced the completion of the ceremony. It was a
moment in which all felt that hands indeed were
stretched across the seas, for under the ocean was flashed
the message of King Edward to the Duke, “My thoughts
are with you in to-day’s most important ceremony. Most
fervently do I wish Australia prosperity and happiness.”
All knew how true those words were, for to the King
the Empire was a trust and a charge which during his
reign he fulfilled in obedience to the highest duty. To the
message from the heart of the Empire, answering words
were sent at once by the Duke of York, telling his Royal
father how the epoch-making ceremonial had been com-
pleted and the King’s greeting read to the 12,000
Australian subjects of His Majesty who were present
at a ceremony rightly described by the Duke as
“splendid and impressive.”
The day was great in potentialities not only for
Australia, but also for the Empire.
The time following the arrival of the “Ophir” in
Hobson’s Bay, four days earlier, on May 5, had been
one long period of rejoicing. Tire reception of the
Royal guests of the Commonwealth, the Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall and York, had been enthusiastic,
and in the public landing at St. Kilda, the procession
through the streets of the great city, decked brilliantly
in holiday attire, there seemed but one thought—loyal
welcome. Troops lined the route of the Royal progress
through Melbourne, the military force being representa-
tive of all the Australian States, New Zealand and Fiji.
Yet in the keeping of order, troops and police
alike, had a sinecure, for joy in welcome is
gentle, and in truth the half-million of spectators were


the best security for their own orderliness. Royal recep-
tions during the day, with reviews and regattas, and illu-
minations in the evening with torch-light processions,
all symbolized the warmth of the Australian heart in
heartiest greeting. Not with the opening ceremonial of
the Federal Parliament did the pageants and loyal
functions in honour of the Royal visitors cease, for school
children were made happy by yieeting the Royal guests
of the Commonwealth, while there was a giving of
honours to notable citizens, among whom were Mr. T.
Proe, Mayor of Brisbane, and Lieutenant-Colonel Byron,
of Queensland. On the former was conferred the Com-
panionship of the Order of St. Michael and St. George,
Colonel Byron being made an extra Royal aide-de-camp.
Captain Lord Crichton; Lieutenant the Duke of Rox-
burgbe; Lieutenant-Colonel Byron, A.D.C.; Dr. Manby;
and Sir Donald Wallace, Assistant Private Secretary.
Monday, May 20, saw the arrival of the Duke and
Duchess of York, who indeed did all in their power
to make amends for the disappointing departure from
the programme, for the warships “Royal Arthur,”
“Ringarooma,” and “Wallaroo” visited Moreton Bay.
Typical of Queensland hospitality was the reception
given to thei Duke and Duchess, and the citizens sur-
passed all former celebrations in their right hearty
greeting of the Royal guests. The streets were trans-
formed for the' occasion. At the top of Queen
Street, where it intersects George Street, was an
A CORNER OF THE BOTANIC GARDENS, BRISBANE.
The happenings in Melbourne were in a real sense
representative of Australia. In Brisbane great
preparations had been made for welcoming tlie
Royal visitors right heartily and it had been
arranged that the “Ophir” should visit the capital of
the northern State on May 15. In the meantime, how-
ever, plague had broken out and Brisbane was then
declared an infected port.
It was found impossible for the Royal
squadron to visit the metropolis of the north, but the
best that could be done under the circumstances was in
the end accomplished, and the Royal visitors travelled
by rail to Brisbane, including the following in the
party: —Lady Mary Lygon; Sir A. Bigge, G.C.V.0.;
Lord Wenlock, Private Secretary; Hon. D. Keppel;
arch symbolical of the wealth of the State, for there
were arranged the chief products of Queensland. In
George Street, then the chief route to Government House
—now devoted to the uses of the Queensland Univer-
sity—was another well-devised feature in the magnificent
pageant, for midway to the lodge gates of the old
vice-regal residence, where sentries in the old army
scarlet were wont to pace, was an aboriginal pyramid.
Here were denizens of the wilds in full war paint, and
here, too, a display of weapons used by the whilom
owners of the soil, together with tasteful adornments in
palm fronds and ferns. The days of festivity passed all
too quickly, for everyone found pleasure in the functions.
These are now but pleasant memories to those
who were among the spectators, but somethin»


very tangible remains to Brisbane of the bygone
halcyon clays before war troubled the nations,
for during their visit to Brisbane the Duke and Duchess
of York became links with the history of the Anglican
Church in Queensland, His Royal Highness laying the
foundation-stone of the new cathedral, a building of
which the city as well as members of that communion
have every reason to be proud. The happiest time, like
the longest day, comes to an end, and so on May 24 the
Royal visitors turned south again, leaving Brisbane for
Sydney, where further ovations awaited them.
All that the Northern sugar-growers predicted, and
indeed everyone who believed that sugar could not be
profitably cultivated without cheap labour, came to pass
speedily on the accomplishment of Federation, for the
Kanaka Bill was unmistakably a declaration that alien
coloured labour must cease. Mr. Barton, the Leader
of the Commonwealth Government, left no room for mis-
understanding on the subject, having announced on
January 17 his policy that the kanaka must go. Look-
ing back we can see that all was for the best, but it
must be remembered that those interested in the
industry, as it was then, were not given the foresight to
realize that the conditions of carrying it on by a vast
increase in the number of growers operating on small
areas of cane, together with the development of the
central mill principle, and above all, a greatly favouring
tariff, would conserve the sugar production.
The points of chief interest were the outstanding
facts that some 120,000 acres of land were devoted to
cane cultivation, the value of the crop in 1900 being
L 1,612,500, the workers in the field being for the most
part 9,000 Polynesians. The problem for solution was
the carrying on of the industry without the aid of
kanakas, and there were very many who did not hesitate
to aver that if the Kanaka Bill became law sugar-
growing was doomed, and that in turn meant the loss of
the large capital invested in sugar manufacturing
machinery and the purchase of sugar land. The
measure, as we have said, was uncompromising in the
attitude taken up. All Polynesians were to be deported
from Australia before the last day of the year 1906.
Those interested in the industry were given five years
to set their house in order. There were very many who
were hopeless of the industry weathering the political
storm. The question, it was contended, was purely a
tropical or sub-tropical one, in which the electors of the
South had no right to interfere. All argument of that
description was, however, obviously quite in vain, for
the vote at the referendum poll gave the electors of the
more densely populated States in the South just that
influence which it was held they should not possess.
The vote for Federation was a fact, and carried with it
the further fact that Queensland immigration was in
the hands of the Federal Government. No soft con-
cessions were in the Kanaka Bill, for among its pro-
visions was a clause setting forth that the islanders
introduced in 1902 must be 25 per cent, less in number
than the kanaka recruits repatriated in the previous
year, while only 50 per cent, of those sent home to
their islands in 1902 should be recruited in 1903. On
March 4, 1904, all recruiting was to cease. It is not
difficult to understand the instability which for a time
threatened the industry, nor the dismay with which the
assertion was met concerning the withdrawal of capital
from white employment which the ceasing of the
indented kanaka labour inferred. For appeal to
figures showed that while the 9,000 kanakas drew from
the industry £148,070 per annum, and the share of the
other aliens was £51,930 per annum, the sum secured
by the whites in the industry was no less than
£1,412,500. It was often asserted then, as indeed it
had often been stated previously, that kanaka labour
was not championed because it was cheap, but because
it gave security concerning the continuance of employes.
Efforts were made to extend the period before the final
repatriation of all kanakas, but neither the striving of
those interested in the industry, nor of the Premier (Mr.
Philp) availed, and the Bill became law on December 17.
It must be confessed that the fixity of tenure as to
labour was the only sound argument the advocates of
a continuance of Polynesian recruiting could advance,
and all the weight of that argument was wholly nullified
by the voluntary entrance of Queensland into the Com-
monwealth.
Then, as now, the question of tariff was of
paramount importance, and Protectionists and Free-
traders battled each for their principles, although both
parties have probably modified their views largely since
the day of which we write. As far as Queensland was
concerned, it was alleged in this State that the Federal
tariff worked out in favour of the producers and manu-
facturers in the more densely populated States of the
South, but such a result was inevitable in view of human
nature being what it is, and the population basis of the
South so different from that of Queensland. One point
of the tariff relation of the Commonwealth is, however,
deserving of special attention, as repatriation of kanakas,
and the relation of that step to the sugar industry, can-
not be understood without referring to the sugar bonus.
The legislation provided for an import duty on sugar of
£6 per ton, for an excise of £3, and a rebate of £2 per
ton on 10 per cent, cane grown by white labour. Such
were the concessions of the Federal Government in com-
pensation for the withdrawal of kanaka labour from
sugar-growers. Upon the tariff and the apprehension
of the electors of the South concerning the importance of


sugar-growing to Australia depends the prosperity, nay
the existence of the industry in Queensland.
Turning to questions wholly pertaining to the
State it may be said that the Liberal Party
held the reins of power in Queensland during
the nineties. The coalition between Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith and Sir Samuel Griffith was the best
thing that could have happened to the country, for
it was to the advantage of the State and all its
interests that two minds so capable and far-reaching,
and yet so diverse in their turn of thought, should have
united to pilot the political ship. Sir Hugh Nelson,
who had held office as Premier and Colonial Treasurer
from 1893 to 1895, there-
after became Chief Secre-
tary and Premier, being
Leader of the Government
for three years subsequently.
With Mr. Horace Tozer as
his lieutenant in the Home
Office, Sir Hugh Nelson did
right excellent work, the
wants of the North in re-
gard to tropical agriculture,
and especially sugar, being
well cared for by Mr. J. Y.
Chataway, who administered
the Agricultural Depart-
ment.
Then came another shuffle
of the political cards,
and Mr. T. J. Byrnes, who
in the office of Attorney-
General had won attention
from all his fellow-Queens-
landers as a young statesman
of great promise, assumed
the Premiership in 1898,
having with him as hie sec-
ond in command Mr. J. R.
Dickson, destined to win his
spurs in the political field through Federation, hor
all who know the Ministerial history of the country a
very sad page indeed is that on which is written Thomas
Joseph Byrnes. Seldom were hopes held justifiably
higher than in the case of the brilliant young native of
Queensland, for taking advantage of the magnificently
complete system of education in the country, he went
on from school to higher school, ever clearing away
every difficulty in the path by his splendid powers of
application and concentration, aiding, as they must
always aid, to attain results, the talents of an intellect,
comprehensive and acute. So Mr. Byrnes won his way
through his University career, then necessarily in the
South. Later, with none to thank but his great mental
gifts and power of will, he became a member of the
Queensland Bar, with a long record of scholastic and
academical triumphs behind him. For such an one, the
doors of the Legislature are open, if not at one side,
then the other, and the victories of his younger days
were but repeated in another sphere. Mr. Byrnes, from
the stepping-stone of the Attorney-Generalship, reached
the highest honours the State could give him, becoming
Premier. The young member of Parliament, eager to
meet those into whose circle he had come, had visited
England, and for some it will be a thrilling thought to
remember how the rising statesman on his return to
Queensland visited, among
other places, Mackay, and
there, while present at a
gathering of citizens, he
received the tidings that the
great tribune of democracy,
William Ewart Gladstone,
bad passed away, full of
years, and with a great work
done. Mr. Byrnes, rightly
deeming it unfit to proceed
with a social programme,
told his hearers in a voice
tinged and sometimes broken
with emotion, how the great
Prime Minister welcomed
him to England, enter-
tained, and advised him.
And it was not difficult to
see, reading between the
lines, that Mr. Gladstone
appraised very highly the
great talents of the young
Queenslander, hoping for
him a career of great useful-
ness to his country. Within
six months the young Pre-
mier had also' passed on to
the unseen, a bright and promising life being cut short
by scarlet fever. A public funeral, and a monument in
the form of a statue erected in Brisbane, gave evidence of
the mourning and regret of the people of the State, who,
indeed, were his admirers.
Events in the making of the Commonwealth have
shown that, following the demise of Mr. Byrnes, the
reins of the Ministerial coach were taken up by Mr.
J. R. Dickson, who held office till December 1. There
is a tide in the affairs of Ministers, just as in men, and
beyond that, political facts are always showing that
Shakespeare’s delineation of the ages of man is no less
true of political affairs than of mankind as a whole.
HON. T. J BYRNES.


The waning powers, the depleted energy, the wrangling
at the dictates of personal ambition, and the decay
through disorganization are symptoms in a Ministry
that new blood is required. So it was with the Liberals,
who had held their course under the banner of pastoral
or commercial interests, or both in combination, for
more than ten years. Thus Mr. Dawson failed
absolutely in his attempt to defeat Mr. Dickson’s
motion for a contingent to aid the Imperial troops in the
Boer war, while the Leader of the Labour Opposition
scored his point so far in regard to the Railways Stand-
ing Committee Bill as to cause the Government to
resign. The Opposition, which was by no means con-
fined to those in antagonism to the Ministry, secured so
strong a following that Mr. Dickson found himself with
a majority of one, the voting being 34 to 33. Under the
circumstances the Premier, taking the only course avail-
able, handed his resignation to the Governor, and Mr.
Dawson was sent for by His Excellency, and expressed
his willingness to form a Ministry, it being then Decem-
ber 1, 1899.
The Ministry duly took form, being constituted as
follows:—Premier and Chief Secretary, Mr. A. Dawson;
Attorney-General, Mr. C. B. Fitzgerald; Home Secre-
tary, Mr. LI. Turley; Treasurer and Postmaster-General,
Mr. W. Kidston; Secretary for Mines and Public In-
struction,- Mr. W. H. Browne; Secretary for Lands and
Agriculture, Mr. H. F. Hardacre; Secretary for Rail-
ways and Public Works, Mr. Andrew Fisher.
The Labour Administration had only a short reign,
for Mr. Dawson and his colleagues occupied the Treasury
Benches for merely one short week. Meanwhile there had
been a change in the leadership of the Liberals, over
whose destinies Mr. Philp now presided. The resignation
of the Ministry came about without heat and quite sim-
ply, for a motion by the Premier, Mr. Dawson, “That the
House do now adjourn,” was negatived, the voting
against being 36, while the ayes numbered 30, the ins of
the political game of rounders being outs. In effect, the
first Labour Ministry in Queensland only held office for
one day, for the adverse vote was given on December 2,
although the party administered affairs for six days
longer at the request of the Governor.
Mr. Philp was Leader of the State Government in
1901, and was popular and effective in his adminis-
tration; above all, he was trusted. His Ministerial
team was a strong one, but Labour was growing, and
perchance the need for maintaining their popularity
was the cause of the large expenditure by the Govern-
ment, which was £4,624,478, as compared with
£4,096,290, the actual receipts. The crushing deficit, the
heaviest till then in the experience of the country, was
attributed to drought on the one hand and uncertainty
as to the action of the Commonwealth Government on
the other. The revenue from railways was less by
.£170,000 than during the previous year, and it cannot
be denied that the constitution of the Post and Tele-
graph Department and Customs as Federal offices barred
all assistance in revenue production from those quarters,
yet it could be alleged with truth that the circumstances
might very reasonably have been anticipated. In cast-
ing about for the financial help required, the Govern-
ment adopted the expedient of drawing upon the landed
estate. Treasury bills were issued bearing interest at
3. 1 , per cent, and redeemable in ten years, the money
wherewith to retire them to be furnished by selling
land. It is to be noted that during the year
a great step forward in Australian self-sustainment was
made, for of the total amount of loan, £2,374,000, auth-
orized by the State Government, £1,000,000 was placed
on the Commonwealth market, and with most satisfac-
tory results, for it was stated at the time that the
floating of the loan in Australia had resulted in a much
better price being obtained than would have been
the case in London, and it was calculated that the
new system resulted in a benefit to the Government of
some £50,000.
In the fiist year of the new century Queens-
land suffei-ed the disaster of a drought, so severe
and so far-reaching that there was hardly a
district that was not affected in trade and gen-
eral prosperity. Not only were the rich pasture
plains of the west denuded of herbage that made them
resemble nothing so much as well-trodden highways, but
the coastal lands in many places were equally bare.
Then, as now, the pastoralist was at the mercy
of the seasons, for even the wisest forethought and
provision could not ensure the safety of thous-
ands of cattle or tens of thousands of sheep in
a season so dry that forest trees perished, pine, sandal-
wood, and coolibah withering away. The travelling of
stock in order that cattle and sheep might find
food became a high science, while to those who
could not travel with their stock the network
of railways became a veritable boon, for fodder
was carried west and even stock trucked east.
It was felt that- the time demanded the sinking of all
questions save the one point of importance to the com-
munity as a whole —the saving of its greatest industry—
and thus the knowledge that the railways were run at
a loss by reason of the lowering of the freight rates
was as widely spread as it was assented to. The losses
stock-owners sustained were enormous, in some cases
representing 80 per cent., while the average deaths in
the case of sheep were appraised at 45| per cent, and
in cattle 28| per cent. And the fact that the other
States of the young Commonwealth were equally under
the scourge of drought intensified the calamity. Stock
could not be renewed by purchase; there were none to
buy. The sole hope of replenishing the flocks and herds

was to be found in breeding. Alone on Nature the
pastoralists were compelled to rely; she did not fail
them, but her methods were slow to those who had lost
millions of pounds.
Later with the rains beneficially falling the country
literally renewed itself and paddocks as though by
magic were clothed in green garments. Yet farming
had suffered and had not recovered. This, however,
applied to sugar production rather than to grain crops,
sugar-cane could not so easily recover from the
effects of the drought, being longer in the ground than
cereals, and thus more immediately under the dry con-
ditions of the preceding year. Not only did drought in-
jure the cane in the Southern and Central districts, but
frost also played havoc with the hopes of the sugar-
growers, with the result that the production was some
30,000 tons below that of the previous season, and this
despite the fact that in the North there had been in-
creased production to the extent of several thousands
of tons. The tonnage yield of sugar per acre fell from
P 55 to P2B, or more than 5 cwt., while the exportation
from Queensland fell from 109,046 tons in the previous
year to 63,843 tons.
Notwithstanding the drought dairying continued to
thrive by aid of the Meat and Dairy Encouragement Act,
and the excellence of the methods adopted was shown by
the fact that the exports of butter did not fall.
The figures during the triennial period were:
1899, value of exportation, £49,429; 1900,
£51,662; 1901, £51,729. The important adjunct in
connection with dairying, pig-breeding, prospered dur-
ing the period under review, the relation of dairying
to pork production not escaping the keen eyes of our
farmers. Bacon factories had been established in many
districts with the result that in all the pork product
cured represented 7,685,446 lb. in 1900, an increase of
537,686 lb. compared with the preceding year.
Circumstances, as the seasons had given them,
precluded an extension of land settlement, and indeed
we find that in the year under review the acreage of
selections in lease up to 1914 totalled 2,402,251, repre-
senting a decrease of 1,133,183 compared with the pre-
vious year, while the arreai’s exclusive under the Lands
Purchase Act amounted to no less than £53,000.
Closely linked with the advancement of agriculture,
was a step taken by the Government at this time, in the
institution of the Agricultural Bank, which was provided
with a capital of £250,000, devoted to assisting settlers
by means of money advances on the security of their
holdings, and at a rate of interest more favourable than
could be obtained elsewhere. Largely availed of, the
Agricultural Bank has become one of the most important
factors in promoting the expansion of farming. It is
now one of the sub-departments, administered by the
Commissioner in charge of the State Savings Bank.
Among those whose place was vacant when 1901 had
run its course was one whose memory it is the duty of
every Queenslander to honour, and who, indeed, was
gradually writing his name across the history of federated
Australia when h© was called to higher service. For
August 8 brought the demise of the Hon. William Henry
O o
Groom, affectionately termed the “Father cf the House’'
by a circle of admirers, far extending beyond the limits
of his electorate or his party, those of Liberal views. Mr.
Groom represented the constituency of Drayton and Too-
woomba for no less than thirty-nine years. He was a
firm and potent friend of his constituents, and nothing
during his long parliamentary career, that could advance
either town or district and was in his power to accomplish,
was left undone. A gifted orator and a graceful and
convincing writer, Mr. Groom added the role of journa-
list and leader writer to his wonderfully able career in
Parliament. As Speaker of the House he fulfilled the
duties in a manner so capable as to justify the use of the
word ideal in regard to the performance of his work.
Exchanging the State sphere for that of Commonwealth
politics, he passed honoured and regretted at the age of
68 years.
The first month of the year saw the passing of
another notable figure in the public and mercantile life
of Queensland, for on January 10, 1901, there died one
who is linked with the coming of Federation and who
also directed the destiny of his adopted country to wise
purpose, while in a business capacity and enterprise he
was no less in the forefront. Sir James Robert Dickson,
Federal Minister for Defence, and who had been
Chief Secretary for Queensland, died at the same
age, sixty-eight, as his one-time colleague Mr. Groom.
Born in Devonshire, Sir James Robert Dickson arrived in
Australia in 1854 at the age of twenty-two. Engaged in
banking and commercial pursuits in Victoria, Mr.
Dickson, as he then was, came to Queensland in 1862 and
built up a successful and influential business as an
auctioneer in Brisbane. He was launched on his political
career by the electors of Enoggera, who returned him as
their Parliamentary representative in 1873. Later he
represented the Bulimba seat, and was indeed in the
service of the people until almost the time of his death.
The value placed upon his work, and the capacity he
evinced in doing it, was testified by the fact that he was
the trusted member of several Ministries, and in 1898
became Leader of the Government, a position to which he
was not unaccustomed, for in 1887 he fulfilled the duties
of Acting-Premier during the absence of Sir Samuel
Griffith in England. We have seen how Sir James Robert
Dickson represented Queensland in London during the
negotiations preliminary to Federation, and the same
business capacity which he displayed in Australia doubt-
less largely contributed to the accomplishment of Com-
monwealth relations.


The year 1902, during nearly its whole course, wit-
nessed conditions of drought unexampled in the history
of Queensland. Here and there, thrice-fortunate dis-
tricts experienced showers, but for the most part the
pressure of hard times was not only general, but terribly
severe. For long, in some cases five years and even six,
there had not been sufficient rainfall, and when the new
year came it brought intense heat, which aggravated the
disastrous season. In the West the country could only
be described as a desert, and things became so adverse
that there was a fear that coach traffic might be forced
to cease. Fortunately, public spirit on the part of
the well-known proprietary,
Cobb & Co., averted that
calamity. During the year,
as may be imagined, the
question of unemployment
raised its head, and it is not
pleasant reading to learn
that heads of faxnilies, rep-
resenting 2,800 persons,
were unable to obtain work.
Special efforts on the part of
the Railway Department
and that of Mines, the lat-
ter affording facilities for a
number of men in prospect-
ing for gold, relieved the
px-essure; but the outlook
was dark indeed. Compari-
son with circumstances as
they were ten years pre-
viously, shows that there
was a decrease in the
number of sheep in the
State to the extent of
some 12,000,000, for while
the tally in 1892 had been
20,000,000 it had shrunk to
less than 8,000,000 in 1902.
As it was with the country’s wealth in flocks so was
it in regard to herds, for the number of cattle in the State
decreased during the same period from 6,591,416 to
3,772,707, or not far from a decrease of almost
one-half. Despite the fact that the export of
frozen meat accounted for a very large number in the
foregoing returns, there remains the fact that the sheep
and cattle in the State had been reduced in numbers to
the extent stated, and the drought still remained a
calamity, no matter though the stock, whence were drawn
the natural increases of flocks and herds were killed and

THE LEAN YEARS OF DROUGHT.
HIS HONOR, MR. JUSTICE LUTWYCHE.
dispatched in frozen shiploads to England, and did not
perish through the drought.
On looking back and realizing the great losses those
on the land sustained, one is moved to wonder at the
healthy vitality both the pastoral and agricultural indus-
tries displayed, for although the land taken up was less
than in 1899-1900 it was considerably greater in area
than in the preceding year 1900-1. In all 59,000 acres
were sold for a total sum of £54,266, as compared with
50,635 acres in 1900-1, when the selling price was
£47,202. The aggregate area alienated since Separa-
tion up to the time of which we write was 16,600,000
acres, of which 13,600,000
acres had been selected,
while 3,000,000 acres had
been disposed of at auction.
The wisdom of the step taken
by the Government, in pur-
chasing for division into
farms the large pastoral
estates alienated in the early
days, was proved by the suc-
cess which attended the sys-
tem. In all, blocks of land
totalling 283,336 acres w 7 ere
purchased at a cost of
£699,816, and all save a
portion of the land most re-
cently purchased was taken
up. The arreai's of rent did
not bulk largely, being only
£4,403. Again, as during
pi'evious years when drought
was experienced in the West,
the farmers in the coastal
districts made good their
losses through the diminu-
tion of the crops by the
eager demand for all
varieties of fodder and the
high prices paid for it by the pastoralists. The pres-
sure of the climax of the “lean yeai's” was intense,
and represented a testing of the State’s inherent strength
and stability most severely. Astonishing is it, therefore,
to read that in the very face of disaster the national life
grew and strengthened, as was evidenced by many phases
of the industries linked with land occupation.
There was, however, one exception, that of sugar
growing, which entered upon a new phase of existence
through the constitution of Federal relations. Cane-
growing suffered greatly through the drought, but it


suffered still more through the centre of power being
shifted. The control was no longer in Qiieensland, for
the two largely populated States in the south, New South
Wales and Victoria, through their representatives in the
Federal Parliament, were masters of the situation, and
could dictate, and did dictate, as to what should be done
in regard to an industry, concerning which both southern
electors and southern members of Parliament were pro-
foundly ignorant. There were many interested in the
sugar industry who were asking if Queensland had sold
her birthright for a mess of political pottage.
In wider relations than those of the States in
Federation, two notable events call for special if brief
mention. The Coronation of Edward VII., appointed to
be held on June 25, was postponed by reason of the
serious illness of His Majesty, from which there was
fortunately good recovery. The ceremonials in London,
of Empire-wide interest, did not take place until nearly
two months later, on August 9, and thus the Prime
Minister (Sir Edmund Barton) and Sir John Forrest,
who represented the Commonwealth on the occasion,
accompanied by an Australian contingent of troops,
were absent from the Commonwealth longer than they
had anticipated. Mr. Deakin performed the duties of
Prime Minister. Queensland was represented at the
Coronation by the Agent-General (Sir Horace Tozer) the
Premier (Mr. Philp) deciding not to leave the State. In
Australia, as throughout the Empire, the celebrations
were most heartfelt and earnest, for no more popular
monarch ever reigned than Edward VII., whose sagacity
and wisdom were given the Empire and civilization for all
too short a time. Prior to the Coronation, in June, yet
another world important event took place, for that month
saw peace in South Africa declared, and the beginning
of that which was to be the South African Union.
All had welcomed the appointment of Lord Hope-
toun as the first Governor-General. His love of sport, his
bonhomie and capacity for dealing with affairs and
administration made his resignation of office widely
regretted. It was not denied that Lord Hope-
toun had spent £49,000 of his private fortune,
nor was it denied that to maintain the dignity
of his position, and dispense the hospitality ex-
pected, he would perforce be compelled to spend
£15,000 per annum of his own income. There was not
only a Government House in Melbourne, but also one
in Sydney to maintain, the expenses of the two establish-
ments being £19,000 per annum. The Governor-General
placed the allowance per annum necessary in addition to
his salary of £lO,OOO, at £B,OOO, but the House of Repre-
sentatives declined to validate that calculation, although
it made a grant of £lO,OOO for expenses in connection
with the Royal visit. Under the circumstances, and
despite all explanations by the Acting Prime Minister,
the Earl of Hopetoun resigned.
In Queensland, domestic politics were of interest,
for a general election, due to Parliament expiring by
effluxion of time, took place in March. The Liberal
Party sought coherence and strength in the establish-
ment of the National Liberal Union. Either the
popularity of the Liberal Party was very great or its
power of organization very excellent indeed, for the
Ministerialists secured 59,785 votes, being more than
11,000 in excess of the majority of the Government three
years previously. It is perchance significant, that during
the triennial period Labour had increased its voting
strength from 36,408 to 43,199, while the unimportance
of other shades of political belief, in the eyes of the
electors, was shown in the fact that “all others” save
Labour and Liberal only numbered 7,835. The member-
ship in the House as a result of the appeal to the people
stood thus:-—-Ministerial, 42; Labour, 23; Independent
Opposition, 7.
In the new Parliament, Mr. A. Morgan
was elected Speaker, while, owing to the illness and con-
sequent absence of Mr. W. H. Browne, Mr. Kidston was
chosen Leader of the Labour Opposition. The latter
gentleman had sat in Parliament as representative of
Rockhampton since 1893, and had been a member of Mr.
Dawson’s short-lived Ministry, where he occupied the
position of Treasurer and Postmaster-General. Mr.
Kidston was destined to influence Queensland’s Parlia-
mentary affairs very strongly, and to be influenced by
them to no less an extent, for the modification of his
views as to Labour, was an excellent illustra ion of the
manner in which political opinions and principles may
be affected by experience in the Blouse and in Office.
No less than four motions of want of confidence were
brought against the Government in the new Parliament,
and the fact that one of them proceeded from a Minis-
terial supporter (Mr. W. D. Armstrong), Member for
Lockyer, is significant. Mr. Armstrong opposed the
increased railway rates as tending to press heavily upon
industries which had already suffered severely from the
drought. The amendment did not find favour with the
House, for it was negatived on the voices. The retrench-
ment proposals of the Government caused interest of the
most personal nature in the Public Service, and despite
the action of the Governor (Sir Herbert C. Chermside)
and the Auditor-General (Mr. T. M. King) in renouncing
a portion of their salaries, their example was not popular,
that is, it was not followed, and a Bill introduced to
reduce the emoluments of the Chief Justice, the puisne
Judges, the Judges of the District Court, and the mem-
bers of the Land Court, failed of its purpose, being very
strongly opposed by members of the legal profession in
Parliament. Through dismissals and retirements in the
Public Service, the sum of £68,851 was saved, and
economy was further studied in the Special Retrench-
ment Act, which aroused strong antagonism in its passage


through the House. Salaries were reduced on the follow-
ing scale:—Over £450 per annum, 15 per cent., but not
to go below £405; between £3OO and £450, 12| per cent.,
but not to go below £270; between £l5O and £3OO, 10
per cent., but not to go below £139 10s.; between £lOO
and £l5O, 7J per cent. It is of interest to note that the
salaries of the Governor and the Auditor-General, who
voluntarily relinquished a portion of their incomes, were
exempted from the operation of the Act, as were also
the following officials: —Judges of the Supreme Court
and District Courts, members of the Land Court, and
any officer whose salary had been reduced since July 1,
1902. Persons in receipt of pensions, superannuation or
retiring allowances were also placed outside the scope of
the measure, which it was
provided should continue in
force until October, 1904.
It is important to note that
during the passage of the
Bill through the Legislative
Assembly, Mr. A. S. Cow-
ley, Member for Herbert,
was successful in securing
the inclusion of a provision
whereby Ministers, Officers
and Members of Parliament
should be subject to a reduc-
tion, similar to that applied
to public servants. Another
method of making good the
loss of revenue facing the
Government from almost all
sides, was the imposition of
an income tax; a Bill pro-
viding for that source of
public income being intro-
duced, but not without an-
tagonism, as was proved by
two motions of want of con-
fidence, one by the Leader
of the Opposition and the
other by Mr. A. S. Cowley.
The second reading of the Bill was only carried in the
Legislative Council by one vote, the numbers being 17 to
16. Despite the belief that other methods of taxation,
involving less cost in collection, together with the sale of
Crown lands, were preferable to an income tax, the mea-
sure became law, and the excellence of the system in
revenue-production is exemplified by the fact that one
Administration after another has adopted the principle.
As a further means of overcoming the financial difficul-
ties, Treasury bills carrying interest at 4 per cent, and
with a currency of ten years were issued to the extent of
£600,000, it being arranged that the bills should be met
at maturity by moneys derived from special sales of land.
It may be mentioned, en 'passant , that the Treasurer in
the course of his Budget speech of the year gave great
umbrage in more than one quarter, by his statement that
in the railways the State “had a valuable asset, which
could, if found desirable, be disposed of at capital cost,
thus relieving ourselves of an annual drain of about
£500,000.” And the harassed Minister, looking in every
direction for an outlet from the financial stress, added,
it must be confessed, hopefully, “Without committing
myself to a recommendation of such a step, I mention it
as a further means by which it would be possible to avoid
burdensome taxation.” During the year the loss on rail-
ways amounted to £600,000. Those interested in local
government affairs, should remember the legislative
enactments of 1902, for in
that year the Local Authori-
ties Bill jjassed through Par-
liament and the old time
Divisions, with their Con-
trolling Local Authorities,
termed Boards, passed away,
being superseded by Shires
and Shire Councils. In all
its provisions, both for
Councils in the towns and in
the country, the law of 1902
was acknowledged to be a
measure of great practical
utility, although it cannot
be denied that as far as the
rural governing bodies were
O O
concerned, the foundation
of the major part of that
which was useful, was to be
found in the Divisional
Board system, introduced by
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith in
the early eighties. Both
measures, each after its
kind, marked an enormous
stride forward in self-gov-
ernment by the people and
for themselves.
Despite the hardships and disabilities occasioned by
seasons of unprecedented drought, agriculture held its
own, the return of wheat in 1901 being 1,692,222
bushels, from a total area of 87,233 acres, or an average
of 19.40 bushels per acre, a return the highest of any
State in Australia. The production of butter, a very
important asset of the State, rose from 20 tons to 931
tons. In 1902 the ghoul of drought had its
finger on both wheat and maize, while in the
case of butter it was necessary to import supplies.
As it was with cotton so was it with tobacco, there was
practical proof that the crop was excellently well adapted,
HIS HONOR, CHIEF JUSTICE. SIR JAMES COCKLE.


not only to the sub-tropical districts of the State but
also the tropical North. Good cigar tobacco was grown
in the Cairns District and found appreciation, while,
for pipe tobacco, Texas on the border of New South
Wales was proving itself admirably well adapted. The
price of the leaf grown at the experimental farm, and
sold at auction during the year, was the highest yet
received, being lid. per lb. An incentive to men on
the land to enter on tobacco-growing was given during
the year, for a large firm of tobacco manufacturers
offered to purchase tobacco leaf in its green state, under-
taking the curing of it subsequently.
An event, notable not only in relation to the progress
and advancement of Australia but also of significance
in the linking of the Commonwealth with the heart of the
Empire and the commercial world as a whole, was the
completion in the last months of the year of the Pacific
cable. It was with just pride that the electric tie
between Britain and her Dominions was known to
traverse an all-red route in its sweep through the ocean
from Southport, on the southern coast of Queensland, to
Vancouver in British Columbia, through the station at
Norfolk Island, whence a line branched to New Zealand,
and whither, on its westward journey, it was borne to
Fiji, Fanning Island, and along the final stretch of the
sea-floor to that part of the Pacific Slope over
which flies the Union Jack. Wholly an Imperial
undertaking, the cost was to be borne in com-
bination with the Imperial Government, and those of the
Commonwealth, Canada, and New Zealand. In all the
length of the trans-Pacific Cable was 7,891 miles, while
the cost of it was £1,886,000. All shortage in the annual
receipts, measured by the amount of the annual instal-
ments covenanted by the associated Governments was to
be made good by joint contributions.
Sugar and the apportionment of protective duty
promised on the banishment of the Polynesians exercised
the attention of Federal legislators, exciting keenest
interest. The rebate it was contended, would in opera-
tion prove most unjust, incurring a loss of £60,000 in the
case of New South Wales and half that amount in regard
to Queensland. As a result of considerable agitation,
the Commonwealth Government changed its system of
working and substituted a bonus of £2 per ton on sugar
grown by white labour for the rebate. Intent on the
payment of the uttermost farthing by the unfortunate
sugar-growers, Senator Glassey secured retrospective
action in regard to qualifications for the bonus, as he
succeeded in securing the inclusion in the Bill of an
amendment providing that no one who had employed
coloured labour could be eligible for the bonus. The
point was subsequently seized that the Senate acted ultra
vires in accepting the amendment, because the latter
had relation to taxation. The desired end was attained
by converting the resolution into a suggestion, which the
House of Representatives accepted. In Queensland there
was at that time strong feeling over the protective duty
in regard to sugar and the position occupied respectively
by Queensland and the Commonwealth. In 1903 the
estimated consumption of sugar in Australia was 170,000
tons, of which amount the north-eastern State produced
80,000 tons, the excise duty (<£3 per ton) totalling
£240,000. The rebate on sugar grown by white labour,
amounting to £2 per ton and claimed for 12,000 tons,
represented £24,000, leaving a sum of £216,000 for the
Commonwealth Treasury.
Two Bills of great moment became law during the
year 1903, the Judiciary and High Court Procedure
Acts, the latter including the greater part of the Criminal
Code and Practice of Queensland which the State owed
to Sir Samuel Griffith. Later in the year, Sir Samuel
Griffith, then Chief Justice of Queensland, became Chief
Justice of the Commonwealth, Sir Edmund Barton, and
Mr. R. C. O’Connor being appointed puisne judges. The
High Court was opened at Melbourne, with ceremonials
proper to the occasion, on October 5. Subsequently,
sittings of the Court were held at Sydney and Brisbane.
Among the measures dealt with by the Federal Par-
liament during the year was the Defence Bill, which
provided for a permanent force of 1,200, the remainder
being citizen-soldiers, with compulsory universal service
in defence of Australia. A clause of the Act, on which so
much was to depend in days nearer our own, was the
provision that citizen soldiers were not to be sent outside
the Commonwealth. Akin to the Defence Bill was the
Naval Agreement Bill, an arrangement with the Imperial
Admiralty, which has stood the severe strain of the Great
War, and proved on the whole the best relations which
could be instituted between the Commonwealth and the
Imperial Government in regard to naval defence. A
local fleet was to take form, the Australian Government
paying the Admiralty an annual subsidy of £200,000,
the agreement being for ten years.
Yet another legislative measure introduced, but
withdrawn during the year and destined to strongly
affect the political life in the Federal sphere, was the
Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, affirming a system,
which it had been often contended only required to be
introduced in order to forthwith put an end to all
industrial disputes and dislocations. The measure pro-
vided for a Court, comprising three judges, one of whom
(the President) should be a Justice of the High Court.
The law specified that the awards should be binding on
all those concerned, that there should be preference to
organizations and members of organizations, and that
there should be power to appoint a tribunal to decide
finally in what cases there might be employment, given
or received, in the case of persons not members of an
organization. The second reading of the Bill was carried
but it was wrecked in Committee. Antagonism was


expressed to the application of the measure to vessels in
the oversea trade, while the refusal of the Ministry to
include seamen as a whole in the operations of the
proposed law, thus affecting coastal shipping, caused the
resignation by Mr. Kingston of the portfolio of Trade
and Customs. A vote in the strength of the Labour
Party to include railway employes in the provisions of
the Bill, was so obnoxious to the Government that the
prospective law was dropped. Meanwhile Sir William
Lyne succeeded Mr. Kingston in the office of
Trade and Customs, Sir John Forrest taking Sir
William Lyne’s place at the Home Department.
Mr. Drake took charge of Defence affairs, the
office Sir John Forrest had held, while Sir P.
O. Fysh became Postmaster-General. During the year
the Federal elections took place, and, as a result of the
voting as a whole, the hands of Labour were strength-
ened. The outcome in regard to Queensland was most
of governing the country; his followers included several
supporters of the late administration and Independent
Opposition, and also all the Labour Party. With the
Premier, Mr. Morgan, who was also Minister for Rail-
ways, there were the following gentlemen who comprised
the Ministry:—Mr. W. Kidston, Treasurer; Mr. D. F.

Mines and Public Works; Mr. A. H. Barlow, Minister
for Public Instruction; and Mr. T. O’Sullivan, Minister
without portfolio. The two last-named members of the
Cabinet had seats in the Upper House. Deficits, present
and past, were met by the issue of Treasury bills, the
price realized being considered satisfactory.

marked, for the candidates endorsed by the Labour
Party (Messrs. Turley, Stewart, and Givens) were placed
at the head of the poll, while in regard to the House of
Representatives Labour secured every seat with the
exception of Oxley, where Mr. Edwards, an Opposition
candidate, found favour.
In this State the Government was faring ill, the
popularity of the Party weakening under the pressure
of taxation duties, as it had also by the postponement of
a Supply Bill, by which the salaries of public servants
were affected, Government and Opposition bickering as to
the responsibility for the delay, each blaming the other.
Grievances were aired, and the Ministry found opposition
among their one-time supporters. The climax came in
September, when a division on the taxation proposals
showed that Mr. Philp’s Ministry had only a majority
of two. The Premier’s resignation followed, and Mr.
Browne, Leader of the Labour Opposition, expressing his
inability to form a Cabinet, Mr. Morgan, whose resigna-
tion as Speaker was announced, undertook tlie business
resumed was thrown open for selection, both for dairy-
ing and for arable farming generally. Agricultural land
was sought in the Darling Downs, together with Wide
Bay and Burnett, and excellent results continued from
the purchase of land for selection, further estates on the
Downs being offered to the Government. The question
of light agricultural railway lines in farming districts
was coming into prominence, favourable attention being
directed to this important subject by the success of a
tramway or light railway, 24 miles in length, which was
built by Local Government enterprise in the Beaudesert
District. In order to have data at its command, the
Executive empowered Mr. G. Phillips, C.E., to report
on the subject, which had close relation to another very
important question, viz., the increased value of Crown
Lands through railway facilities in regard to farming
operations.
The Opposition may not have been over strong
numerically in 1904, although the weight of office was
pressing hard upon an Administration that had some


of the elements of weakness, yet Mr. Philp and his
supporters proved themselves very capable of criticism
and were not sparing in the exercise of their powers. No
sooner had Parliament assembled in May than trouble
began for the Government, and the debate on the
Address-in-Reply was, as far as the supporters of the
Opposition were concerned, an indictment or rather an
impeachment of the Government. A subject always
available for vituperation is the appointment of Legisla-
tive Councillors, and so it came that the send-
ing of seven gentlemen to the Upper House, five of them
being supporters of the Government, while the remaining
two were firmly imbued with Labour principles, gave
great umbrage.
Another question that exercised the attention and
roused the feelings of Parliamentarians, and indeed of a
large section of the public, arose in the appointment of a
commercial agent of the State in the East. Queensland
decided not to wait on the Commonwealth Government
in regard to this important subject, and thus it came
that a representative to work on behalf of the State in
the direction indicated was chosen, Mr. Frederick Jones
being appointed for a term of six months at a salary of
£250. Despite fierce party antagonism the Ministry stuck
to its guns, and Mr. Jones proceeded on his mission to
the Straits Settlements and China and Japan.
No sooner had the furore of criticism died away in
the cases referred to, than the action of the Government
in the appointment of a. Commission or Eoard to enquire
into the Public Service in all its economic relations, with
a view to retrenchment, aroused much venom.
The members chosen to report on the subject
were Messrs. Troupe and Saunders of New South
Wales and Mr. 11. D. Brennan of the Audit
Department, and it was particularly against the
last-named gentleman that the criticism was levelled;
the main ground of the complaint being probably due
to the fact that a junior officer of the Audit Department
was placed in a position whence he could pass judgment
on those officials who were senior to him in the Service.
The sugar industry was interested in yet another
criticism of the Ministry, that of its action in ratifying a
further engagement for three years with Dr. Maxwell,
who had been engaged in America as Director of Sugar-
experiment and who had rendered valuable
service to cane-growers and sugar-producers during the
term of engagement, which had drawn to an end. Indeed
the very fact that the Ministry contemplated the re-
engagement of the sugar expert was good proof that
he had done excellent work. Under the arrangement of
the first engagement the sugar-growers had agreed to
defray the half of Dr. Maxwell’s salary, which was
£3,000 per annum in all, for a period of five years; and
here again we have excellent evidence that the work to
be done was realized to be of the very highest importance.
Under the terms of the re-engagement, however, the
whole of Dr. Maxwell’s salary was to be paid by the State,
while he was to add to his duties in connection with sugar-
experiment stations, those of Comptroller of Central
Mills. This step on the part of the Government gave
great umbrage to those whose representatives were, in
the initiative, the chief factor in the appointment of Dr.
Maxwell, for it was asserted that the added duties
imposed on that gentleman would militate largely against
the efficiency of his work in the field, for which he was
primarily selected. It was further urged with cogency, it
must be confessed, that capability to administer affairs
at experiment stations did not carry with it the capacity
for the management of central mills, and it was also
pointed out that men thoroughly versed in that phase
of sugar production and with practical experience far
greater than that of Dr. Maxwell were to be
found in the State. The whole of the sugar industry—
all engaged in it—took part in the controversy, and cer-
tainly the action of the Government in expanding Dr.
Maxwell’s duties, while prepared to find all the money
for the large salary of the expert, was significant.
There was further grumbling because the Min-
istry declined to accept the offer of a private
company to build a railway to Georgetown, if a
subsidy of £7,500 per annum were given. To the un-
biased spectator of the drama of politics it does seem to
savour of super-suspicion to refuse to utilize capital just
because it is capital, as long as there was due provision
for subsequent acquirement by the State through pur-
chase of the railway built. Yet another allegation, which
to the wider vision of these days has far less justification
than any one of the other charges, is found in the com-
plaint made that money had been squandered in
giving work to the unemployed in clearing land infested
with prickly pear.
At the end of ten days the debate found its termina-
tion in the inevitable amendment, moved by Mr. J. C.
Cribb, affirming a want of confidence; and this ushered in
a further debate which was prolonged for seven days, the
finale being a division in which the Ministry found
itself with a majority of one. Mr. Morgan’s resignation
followed, he advising the Governor to dissolve Parliament.
This course was not then taken, but after Mr. Philp (the
retiring Leader of the Opposition) and Sir Arthur Rut-
ledge (who succeeded him in the leadership of the Party)
had been sent for, and the latter having failed in the
forming of a Ministry, Mr. Morgan was again sent for
and his advice concerning a dissolution was adopted.
Then followed the announcement that the general
election would take place on August 27. The results
gave Labour thirty-four representatives, while the Min-
isterial members or Morganites, as they were termed,


totalled twenty-one. The Opposition members numbered
seventeen. A combined Morgan-Labour administration
followed, the membership of the Ministry being capable
of definition as an adaptation to circumstance.
It chanced that the Government was not able to
fulfil its pledge concerning the non-imposition of a
Special Retrenchment Bill. Circumstances were against
them in a shortage to the extent of £70,000 in the
revenue received from the Commonwealth, the uncer-
tainty of which gave great dissatisfaction, and assuredly
there seems to have been excellent reason for the con-
demnation by the State Treasurer of the system, whereby
three-fourths of the Commonwealth Customs duty was
returned, while there was no effort to return to a par-
ticular State any part of its own Customs revenue. As
charged on the remainder, while on incomes exceeding
£3OO and not exceeding £SOO sixpence in the pound was
payable. In other incomes, such as those up to £I,OOO,
sixpence in the pound was payable on the first £SOO and
sevenpence on the remainder, and this system was
pursued in larger incomes, the amount per pound increas-
ing in a given sum in each case. There was, during the
year, an amendment of the Agricultural Bank Act, by
which the scope of the measure was enlarged so as to
include advances on the following grounds : —Payment of
liabilities already existing on the holding : agricultural,
dairying, grazing, horticultural or viticultural undertak-
ings; adding to improvements already made; and lastly
the purchase of stock, machinery, or implements. In the
last-named cases and in regard to repayment of prior

things had eventuated, recourse to retrenchment was un-
avoidable. The measure imposing the system was, how-
ever, less drastic than the proposals, for it pro-
vided for only one-half the reductions of the previous Bill,
and that the officers affected should be repaid the amount
of reduction, or a pro-rata apportionment, if the source
from which repayments were to be drawn —the excess of
revenue over expenditure —was insufficient for complete
and full repayment. Under the circumstances the sar-
donic critics had no reason to jeer at broken political
pledges. In regard to the income tax, the amending
Bill exempted, as was promised, incomes under and up
to £IOO, while the tax up to £125 was fixed at ten
shillings, and that up to £l5O was placed at £l. On the
income of all land owned by absentee companies, a tax
of one shilling in the pound was imposed. In the taxa-
tion of incomes up to £3OO, the tax was not payable on
£IOO of the amount, and sixpence in the pound was
liabilities, the advances were to be limited to ten shil-
lings in the pound of the estimated value of the holding,
with the improvements made or proposed to be made.
When the advances were desired for other purposes the
loan might be twelve shillings in the pound. Repayment
under the first scale was to be made in twenty-five years,
in half-yearly instalments of £3 11s. per cent. In a
further amendment of the Act in the succeeding session
it is noteworthy to find a provision stating that “No
advance under the Principal Act, or this Act, shall be
made to any alien.” Among the legislative measures of
the year was the Queensland National Bank, Limited
(Agreement) Act, by which it was provided that the
balance then due to the Government, £1,463,660 165.,
should be liquidated in sixteen promissory notes, each for
£86,097 13s. Id., with one promissory note for £86,097
14s. Bd. All notes were to bear interest at the rate of
£2 12s. 6d.per cent., and were to be payable on June 30


iii each year. The measure further provided that until
the half of the sum owing, with interest, had been paid,
there should be no dividends paid by the Bank, while
thereafter, until all the amount due to the Government
had been paid, the dividends should not exceed 3| per-
cent. In the event of any default, power under the Act
was given to the Treasurer to terminate the agreement.
In dealing with the legislative measures of the session
it may be of interest to note that the Supreme Court
gave judgment against the Income Tax Commissioner in
his reading of the Act under which he worked, for the
judicial finding was that no income tax was payable from
the annual increase of stock, as the latter could not be
treated as income until turned into money.
It must be confessed that the Treasurer had reason
for considering that the outlook was cheerful, for not
only was the deficit reduced to £12,000 under actual
expenditure, but the producing power of the State
promised to be enlarged desirably. In regard to stock
there was, it is true, not so great an increase in the
number of cattle as in sheep, where the percentage was
29 21, but yet the number of cattle rose from 2,481,717
in 1903 to 2,722,341 in 1904. In all the increase of
sheep totalled 1,178,000. In another factor of prosperity,
mining, there was much to give pleasure to the well-
wishers of Queensland, for the mineral production for
the year was valued at £3,704,241, being the largest
then attained.
During the year 1905 good seasons were experi-
enced, with the result that the pastoral and agricultural
industries alike were favoured with prosperous times.
Settlement, the great factor in advancement, was stimu-
lated, and it may be added wisely encouraged, as we
have seen, by legislation.
Although not so much was heard of Queensland
wines as of those in the South, yet in some of the districts,
as in Moreton and Toowoomba, viticulture was carried
on very successfully, no less than 3,017,743 lb. of grapes
in all were produced, and of the crop a portion was
devoted to wine making, 66,926 gallons of wine being
made, and, we add, bore very favourable comparison
with the wine of New South Wales, Victoria, and South
Australia, Other phases of fruit-growing expanded
under the influence of Federation, but then, as up to
our own times, there were influences at work which did
not make for justice to the banana growers of the
northern rivers of New South Wales and Queensland,
for even to the meanest understanding it was obvious
that to take advantage of the cheaper rate at which
bananas grown by coloured labour in Fiji could be sold
in Australia, as against the fruit grown by white labour
within the Commonwealth, was hardly in consonance
with the views enunciated by those marching under the
banner of a White Australia. In 1905 there were grown
in Queensland in all 2,509,268 bunches of bananas, while
the returns showed that 506,886 doz. of pineapples were
raised and 2,335,947 doz. of oranges.
During the course of the year there was a good
deal of excitement in legal and political circles at the
rumour that on the score of expense the High Court
should no longer be held in Brisbane. The members of
the Queensland Bar held a meeting in the month of
March at which a vigorous protest against the proposed
change was agreed to. The Federal authorities, how-
ever, seemed to have seen the error of their ways, for the
grievance was obviated and the question settled in June,
with the result that succeeding sittings of the High
Court took place in Brisbane.
As a community the citizens of the capital could
point to 1905 as a year in which great progress was
attained in more than one phase of national life, for
there was promise of substantial commercial results
attending the completion of contracts between the
Queensland Meat Export Company and the United States
Government for the supply of meat to the troops at the
Philippines, and the month of July brought the opening
of the Lady Lamingtou Hospital, the naming of which
perpetuated the memory of earnest and practical work
done by a lady who made many friends in Queensland.
Later in the following month the Presbyterian denomin-
ation added to the many places of worship in Brisbane
by a church of imposing architecture, St. Andrew’s,
which was opened on August 27.
Yet another incident very noteworthy took place a
few weeks later, when a donation of land valued at
£25,000 was made in favour of the Young Men’s
Christian Association, and as a result a building was
erected in Upper Edward Street of which not only the
members but all the citizens should be very proud, and
which in regard to the benefits conferred on those whom
the donor desired to serve should amply have satisfied a
mind as intent on doing good as it was most generous.
The year 1905 brought with it many events, sad as
well as bright, and among them a change in the ■personnel
of vice-regal representation. Early in the year Governor
Chermside resigned his duties and Lord Chelmsford,
appointed to succeed him, arrived in the State on
November 29, being accorded a very hearty reception by
the citizens of Brisbane, promise and prophecy of those
extremely cordial relations which were destined to' exist
between the Governor and the people of Queensland.
W ith the passing of the year there also passed
two men, both of whom had made their career a part of
the larger life of the State. On May 6 there died in
England the man who first held the office of Premier in
Queensland. To many, perhaps, it was even in those
days difficult to realize that Sir Robert G. W. Herbert,
Permanent Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office, and
whose career was as brilliant as it was useful to the
Empire, had shared in the hopes and fought down the


fears inseparable from the beginnings of autonomy in
North-eastern Australia. Yet the capable adviser of the
Secretary of State, in whose hands lay so much power to
make or mar vast stretches of colonial empire, had been
familiar with Brisbane in what may truthfully be
termed her village days. Sir Robert Herbert’s distin-
guished career came to a close at the age of seventy-four.
In 1905 there also died one whose life and successes
stamped him as a most capable man of affairs. Mr.
Boyd Morehead was Australian bred and Australian
educated. He was one of the many who associated their
first acquaintance in the sphere of letters with the
appointment he held as inspector of stations for the
Scottish Australian Investment Company. Thereafter,
in 1871, another side of life was added to those in which
he had emerged above his fellows, for he was elected
member for Mitchell, being subsequently returned for
the Balonne seat. Meanwhile, in 1873, he established
the important and widely-ramifying mercantile business
which perpetuates his memory through its name of
Moreheads Limited. Associated with Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith in political work and ambitions, Mr. More-
head was brilliant in debate and became known as the
Rupert of the Parliamentary forces. The Premiership

life and its experiences were united with a no less practi-
cal knowledge of pastoral affairs, as was shown by the
came in 1888, and eight years later Mr. Morehead was
called to the Upper House. His death removed a man
to whom Queensland owes much, and whose memory she
honours.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
THE PASSING OF OLD-TIME POLITICS.
The natal day of 1906 brought death to one who
had been a notable figure in Queensland politics, for
Sir Hugh Muir Nelson, who had been in ill-
health for some time, died as the new year was
born, and thus there was removed one who
played a great part in the public life of Queensland.
The son of the Rev. W. L. Nelson, D.D., who himself
did much to advance the interests of Australia in
general as well as Queensland, Sir Hugh was born in
Edinburgh in 1835, and there educated at the High
School and University. Coming to Queensland in the
fifties he engaged in pastoral pursuits on the Downs,
beginning his Parliamentary career by the representa-
tion in 1883 of the Northern Downs, which constituency
he changed for that of Murilla. The portfolio ot
Railways came to him only a few years after he entered
the House, and in 1891 he was chosen Leader of the
Opposition. The Premiership of the Colony was achieved
in 1893. In 1896 he received the honour of knighthood,
and two years later Sir Hugh resigned his Ministerial


offices to accept the Presidency of the Legislative
Council. Subsequently he became a Privy Councillor.
As Lieutenant-Governor it fell to Sir Hugh Nelson to
perform the duties of representative to the Crown, and
there, as in all other phases of his duties the work he did
was exceptionally good. Gifted with a far-reaching
intellect, with great capacity for business, as was proved
by his record as Treasurer, Sir Hugh Nelson was per-
chance especially fortunate in that he possessed that
saving faculty of humour which is as salt to other mental
qualities. Kindly and warm hearted, he was a man of
high ideals and strove to live up to them. Queensland
was poorer through his passing though enriched by his
work.
Beyond the direct loss which the death of Sir Hugh
Nelson inferred his demise brought about immediate
and great changes in the Ministry. Mr. Morgan vacated
the Premiership and became President of the Legislative
Council, while to Mr. William Kidston came the office
of Premier, the Department of the Treasury being
retained and added to the duties of the Leader of the
House. In its reconstructed form with its new Leader
the Government became as follows;—Vice-President of
the Executive Council, Chief Secretary, and Treasurer,
Mr. William Kidston; Attorney-General and Secretary
for Mines, Mr. J. W. Blair; Secretary for Public Lands,
Mr. J. T. Bell; Secretary for Public Works, Mr. Thos.
O'Sullivan; Home Secretary, Mr. Peter Airey; Secre-
tary for Agriculture and Railways, Mr. D. F. Denham;
Secretary for Public Instruction (with seat in the Upper-
House), Mr. A. H. Barlow. Death and resignations
had reduced the number of Legislative councillors, and
as a result the following five gentlemen were appointed :
—Mr. W. H. Campbell, Barcaldine; Mr. A. A.
Davey, Brisbane; Mr. T. M. Hall, Brisbane; Mr. H. L.
Groom, Toowoomba; and Mr. W. T. Rawlings, of
Irvinebank. With the additional members the Upper
Chamber comprised forty-four members in all.
Parliament assembled in July, and among the first
measures to be dealt with was a motion by the Leader
of the Opposition (Mr. Philp) providing for a reduction
in membership of the Legislative Assembly to fifty. The
motion failed of its jmrpose, being defeated, as was also
a further resolution for the reduction in the number of
members to' forty-eight. Despite the strenuous
antagonism from the Labour Party the Chillagoe-
Georgetown railway, in other words the linking up of
the Etheridge goldfields with the railway system, was
approved.
I he turmoil of a religious question also began, for
in fulfilment of the pledge given by both the Phil]) and
Morgan Administrations that the wishes of the people
in regard to religious instruction in State schools should
be ascertained, a Bill providing the necessary machinery
for taking a referendum on the subject was introduced
into Parliament, but the measure being approved in the
Assembly by only the casting vote of the Speaker the
Government decided to withdraw the Bill. Later the
people were afforded the opportunity of expressing an
opinion concerning the advisability of adopting the
system in use in New South Wales, which provides that
the headmaster of State schools should give selected read-
ings from the Bible and instruction wholly unsectarian,
while the clergymen of the various Churches were
authorized to impart religious instruction during and
on such days as the school committee might arrange, the
pupils being, of course, the young people of the Church
members in each case. The referendum was an
object lesson on the assertion often made that great
carelessness in regard to religious subjects prevails
among many people. No subject excited more attention
during a campaign into which great energy was thrown,
the verdict of the electors in the ultimate being strongly
in favour of religious teaching.
Not only in the lower spheres of instruction was
there interest evinced, for on November 13 a congress
to consider the question of founding a University in
Queensland was opened by the Governor.
Things went well with Mr. Kidston’s Administra-
tion ; the financial statement which was delivered on
August 28 showed that the revenue was £3,853,523,
which was no less than £218,523 above the estimate, a
satisfactory condition of affairs for Ministry and State
alike, to which the propitious seasons greatly contri-
buted. Mr. Kidston is to be credited with initiating a
conference of Premiers of the various States, for in the
financial statement of the year 1906 he in his office of
Treasurer was severe in his strictures on the financial
relations imposed by the Federal Government, which
Mr. Kidston averred were “inherently bad, and if per-
mitted to remain unchanged will undermine in State
Ministries all healthy sense of responsibility and
ultimately destroy the financial stability of the State.”
As a result of the criticism of the Premier of Queensland
a meeting of leaders of the Government and leaders of
the Opposition in the States under the Federation took
place, the Queensland representatives being Messrs. W.
Kidston, R. Philp, and J. W. Blair. Following upon the
deliberations of the conference it was decided: “That
the Braddon clause should continue till 1920 and be
unchanged save by an amendment of the Constitution;
that the Customs and Excise revenue due to the States
be calculated upon the several returns between the years
1901 and 1910; that in certain cases and for specific
purposes the Federal Government should have power to
impose duties; that the State debt scheme formulated by
Sir John Forrest be approved, and that a special con-
ference be called to further consider the question.”


The previous year had seen Cairns swept by a
wind of hurricane force, and the new year brought a
cyclonic visitation which laid the greater part of Cook-
town low, levelling public buildings and residences as
though they had been houses of cards. Cooktown has
been well described as the windiest place in Australia,
but the inhabitants never experienced so devastating
a cyclone as that
which came as the
culmination of the
intensely hot wea-
ther on January
19, 1907, when a
rapidly falling baro-
meter gave warning
that something ex-
traordinary in the
weather conditions
was to be experi-
enced. Increasing
in violence shortly
after noon the wind
soon blew with a
hurricane force so
great that it was
almost impossible to
make way along the
storm-swept streets,
and it was neces-
sary to seek shelter,
for many houses
were unroofed while
not a few were
wrecked wholly and
the occupants forced
to flee to other
refuges deemed
stronger or more
sheltered. Rain in
torrents accompan-
ied the wind storm,
the rain drops driv-
ing with blinding and painful force against the fugitives,
for only those seeking shelter or others risking life and
limb in strengthening their houses were abroad. All day
the wind blew wildly and fiercely, and crash after crash
punctuated the devastation it was causing. Churches,
schools, banks —nothing seemed strong enough to with-
stand the hurricane, and it was not till the dawning of
a new day that the inhabitants of the town could feel
CHAPTER XXXIV.
CYCLONES AND LOSS OF LIFE IN THE NORTH.
YABBA FALLS, NORTH COAST
sure that the danger had passed. The shipping in the
Endeavour River was driven ashore for the most part,
while hawser after hawser was used to moor the steamer
“Aramac” to the wharf. Next day was a scene of
desolation, in all direction fences were strewn on the
ground, and galvanized iron tanks which had hurtled
through the air as though they had been paper were
found lodged in
vacant allotments,
whilst beams of tim-
ber and sheets of
iron driven from
one side of the
streets to the other
bore witness to the
incredible force of
the wind, and
among the fatali-
ties was a little
child killed in its
mother’s arms by a
jagged piece of tim-
ber driven in and
through the body of
the little one. In
the country the toll
taken by the storm
fiend was as great
as in the town, and
in that part of the
district not far
south of Cooktown
the cyclone blazed
its track through
the forest, felling
the trees as
straightly and as
regularly as though
a company of
giant axemen had
been at work.
In all, the damage
done through the devastation of the hurricane was esti-
mated at =£20,000, but to those present during a very
adventurous time that sum seems to inadequately repre-
sent the desolation wrought.
Among the tragic incidents which arose from the
cyclone was the wreck of the Government ketch “Pilot,”
which sailed out of Cooktown before the hurricane
came but never returned. The little vessel, commanded


by Captain Osterlind, and with her usual crew,
sailed forth on her periodical mission of carrying supplies
to the lighthouse staffs stationed in the North. The
“Pilot” on this occasion carried a passenger, Mr. Har-
greaves, M.L.A., who being in his constituency during
the Parliamentary recess was asked by the Government
to make enquiry into certain questions which the men
at an island lighthouse desired to lay before the authori-
ties. Many a hope was voiced in the days succeeding
the cyclone that the “Pilot” was sheltering somewhere,
but when the steamer “Seymour,” which had been sent
out in search, returned, it was known that the “Pilot”
had gone on the rocks. A pillow or two and
the combing of the hatch of the ketch was all
that was left of the staunch little vessel. Those
who manned her, the skipper and his crew, with
the member for the district, a deservedly popular
representative, had gone; in truth there was no
hope of survival in the wild waste of waters which
foamed and raged between the Barrier Reef and the
rockbound coast where the harbours of refuge are so
few.
Only a few weeks subsequently to the cyclone yet
another tragedy was enacted along the shores of the
Endeavour, for on February 18 the auxiliary schooner
“Papuan” was blown up with her cargo of ben-
zine stowed for shipment to Samarai and Port
Moresby in British New Guinea, or Papua, as
the possession was then named. The “Papuan”
was owned by Messrs. Clunn, merchants, of Cooktown,
and commanded by Captain Anderson, her crew being
for the most part natives of Papua. One white man,
who was in charge of the auxiliary engines was on board
on the night in question, together with three or four
“black boys,” all the others, officers and men, being
ashore. One of the Papuans is supposed to have been
responsible for the destruction of the vessel by searching
with a lighted match for kerosene for his lamp In the
hold. A leaky tin of benzine was encountered in his
quest, and then came chaos. A portion of the deck of
the “Papuan” was blown up, the thunderous noise of the
explosion being heard from end to end of Cooktown.
Both masts and booms shot high into the air. There
were also driven on high the remains of the unfortunate
coloured boys, and the fragments were discovered three
or four days subsequently. The white man being at a
point less subject to the force of the concussion made his
escape across the burning deck and wharf all aglow. He
experienced a marvellous escape, for his feet were
horribly burnt, as were other parts of his body, and the
unfortunate man suffered agonies, though later he made
excellent recovery in the Cooktown Hospital. A wild
scene the riverside presented, the flames of the burning
vessel lighting up river and shore until the schooner
sank, and so the flames were stifled. Even then the
weirdest of illuminations continued, for tins of benzine
alight floated down the stream, and the river seemed
literally on fire.
Among things jmlitical during the early months of
1907 was the withdrawal of Mr. D. F. Denham from the
Kidston Administration, in which he had held the port-
folios of Agriculture and Railways. Mr. Denham was
destined to draw to him a jmwerful following ere many
years, and as Premier became a deservedly important
figure in Queensland Statecraft. On Mr. Denham’s
withdrawal from the Cabinet Mr. O’Sullivan took charge
of Agriculture in addition to the Department of Works
which he already administered, while the Minister for
Lands, Mr. J. T. Bell, added the portfolio of Railways
to that of Lands.
The general election which took place in May, 1907,
aroused keen interest, as it was the first time on which
the franchise was exercised by women in the State.
Politics may be described as triangular in character,
Kidstonites being pitted against Philpites and Labour-
ites, if not antagonistic to both yet quite ready to take
advantage of the balance of power which their position
gave them. As a result of the appeal to the people
on May 18 the new Parliament was represented by
thirty members who followed Mr. Philp’s banner,
twenty-three supporters of Mr. Kidston, and eighteen
Labourites. Mr. Airey failed to make good for Flinders
and was succeeded at the Home Department by Mr. A.
G. C. Hawthorn, while Mr. G. Kerr became Secretary
for Railways. Both Mr. Airey and Mr. F. McDonnell
were given seats in the Upper House, Mr. McDonnell
not having contested his former constituency of Forti-
tude Valley by reason of ill-health. Mr. H. Turner,
who did not stand for re-election at North Rockhampton,
where Mr. James Brennan, a supporter of Mr. Kidston,
was elected, was also made a member of the Legislative
Council.
The circumstances attendant on a strongly developed
exhibition of three parties in Parliament show that
uncertainty must become the prominent feature in
administrative life, a decisive vote becoming a matter
of arrangement. This weakness on the part of repelling
an attack threatened defeat for the Government, but
was met, according to the standpoint adopted by Mr.
Bowman, through support in a general sense being
given by Labour to the Government.
Legislation for the constitution of Wages Boards
had been included in the measure dealing with shops
and factories which became law in the previous year,
but in order to enlarge the scope of the system and
make its application general, a Wages Bill was intro-
duced into Parliament. The principle of Boards whereby
questions of wages could be settled justly could not be
legitimately objected to by anyone, but there were
many in Parliament and among the electors who


considered the hard-and-fast regulations as to hours were
not applicable to certain industrial fields, and again the
Upper House withstood the will of the elective Chamber.
The result was that the Councillors carried an amend-
ment excluding employes in the industries of agriculture,
grazing, horticulture, viticulture, and dairying from the
operation of the proposed law. And the fact that the
amendment in the Upper House was carried by 19 votes
to 10 proved clearly that the question was not being
considered on party lines. In the Assembly Government
influence predominated, and the widest possible scope to
the Wages Board system was reaffirmed. An appeal to
Labour to come within the Government fold as far as
the present Parliament was concerned seems to have
failed of its purpose, and the climax came in
the resignation of the Ministry. Mr. Philp was sent
for and accepted the task of forming a Cabinet. Then
the unexpected happened, for the triangular system
again came into action, and Mr. Kidston found himself
so strongly supported that he was able to defeat
similar in constitution to that of which lie was previously
the Leader, save that he himself handed over the
portfolio of the Treasury to Mr. Airey, while to Mr.
O’Sullivan fell the Department of Agriculture, which
he had previously controlled, a seat in the Legislative
Council being given to him following his defeat at
Warwick, which he essayed to capture from Mr. G. P.
Barnes.
Legislation of importance was carried out during
the session, among the enactments being a Bill to amend
the Constitution by providing that a bare majority in
both Houses should suffice to make alteration instead of
two-thirds of a majority in both Chambers, together
with the passage through both Houses of the Imperial
Parliament, as had been the procedure up to that time.
Yet another important measure passed the House in
the form of the Parliamentary Bills Referendum Bill,
which was an effort to prevent the game of battledore
and shuttlecock so often played between the two Houses
of Parliament. The measure which was carried set forth
SHIPPING AT SOUTH BRISBANE REACH.
Mr. Pliilp’s intention to pass the Estimates, the Chair-
man of Committees being moved out of the chair. Mean-
while the Governor had granted a dissolution, and
although Supply had not been granted Parliament came
to an end on the last day of the year, the general election
being appointed to be held on February 5, 1908. Mr.
Philp took office on November 19, and remained in power
until the new Parliament assembled on February 18.
The general elections which took place on February
5, 1908, demonstrated that a change of opinion bad
taken place on the part of the electors, for the poll
showed that both the Kidstonites and the Labour Party
had increased their strength at the expense of the Philp-
ites, whose numbers at the election during the previous
year had decreased from 30 to 25, while the Kidstonites
and Labourites had increased, the former from 23 to 24
and the latter from 18 to 22. Such were the triangular
political forces, together with a solitary Independent,
which caused Mr. Philp to resign, and led to a resump-
tion of the office by Mr. Kidston, whose Ministry was
that when a Bill had been twice negatived by the Legis-
lative Assembly and Council respectively it was open for
the proposed law to be laid before the people in
referendum, and if it were by the electors approved it
should have all the power of an Act of Parliament.
During the Parliamentary recess the Premier
visited the United Kingdom, but returned in time for
the opening of Parliament in November, or rather in
time to reconstruct his Ministry prior to proceeding with
legislative business. A Coalition was arranged
between the Kidstonites and the Philpites, Mr.
Kidston bidding a solemn farewell to his Labourism.
Messrs. Airey, Kerr, Woods, Mann, and Murphy would
have nothing to do with the incoming of the Opposition,
but that did not prevent the coalition being consum-
mated. The new Cabinet was constituted as follows:
Premier and Chief Secretary, Mr. W. Kidston; Secre-
tary for Public Instruction, Mr. A. 11. Barlow; Home
Secretary, Mr. J. T. Bell; Secretary for Lands, Mr.
D. F. Denham; Attorney-General, Mr. T. O’Sullivan;


Secretary for Mines and Works, Mr. J. G. Appel;
Secretary for Railways and Agriculture, Mr. W. T.
Paget; Treasurer, Mr. A. C. G. Hawthorn. The
Assembly under the reconstruction numbered 43
supporters of the Coalition Government, the members of
the Opposition being 28 in all, inclusive of those who,
declining to accept the union with those who previously
constituted the Opposition, became either Labourites
or political Ishmaelites, their hand being against
every man. The ratification of the Torres Strait
mail contract by which space for immigrants,
cold storage for 1,500 tons of meat, and a passage of 46
days to England were secured, aroused antagonism
from the Labour Party, who objected to the immigration
arrangements, but Mr. Kidston’s statecraft provided for
the completion of the arrangement.
In general prosperity the year 1908 was beneficent
and a sovereign test, a Ministerial surplus, bore witness
to good times, for against the estimated surplus of
£7,104 there was placed the actual amount of £115,308.
CHAPTER XXXV.
THE YEAR OF JUBILEE.
Aii unexpected death in the early days of 1909
brought a change in one of the high offices, for ere the
first month of the new year had waned Mr. John Leahy,
Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, succumbed to an
attack of influenza. The necessary election later resulted
in the return to Parliament of a Labourite, Mr. B. F. S.
Allen, who defeated the Ministerial candidate, Mr.
Cordner, the latter securing 258 votes against 360 polled
for his successful rival. Some five months later Mr.
J. D. Campbell, who had been conrpelled through indis-
position to resign his constituency of Moreton, passed
away, his place in Parliament being filled by Mr. J.
Forsyth, who had in yeai's past been member for
Carpentaria.
The days of Lord Chelmsford’s governorship came
to an end during the year, and perchance, because it
was thought that His Excellency had felt the by wash of
party animosities in the fulfilment of his vice-regal
duties, his leave-taking in Queensland was attended by
the most cordial good wishes. Following Lord
Chelmsford, who subsequently had a most distin-
guished career, which included the blue ribbon of the
service in the Viceroyship of India, there came to
Queensland one who from first to last ingratiated himself
with the community and deservedly won golden opinions
from all sections of society, for there was something of
the father, as well as the King’s representative, in the
relations of Sir William MacGregor to the people among
whom he lived as Governor. Parliament assembled on
June 29, and the Independent Liberals, whose phalanx
behind Mr. Blair was in some quarters deemed fatal,
nominated Mr. M. E. M. Jenkinson, member for Fassi-
fern, for the Speakership, Mr. J. T. Bell, lately Home
Secretary, being the other candidate. The contest was
close, the voting being 38 against 36, while among the
majority votes was one east by Mr. Bell himself. It is,
however, fair to say that only the exigencies of party
caused the Speaker elected to vote for himself, as he had
left the House. Mr. Bowman, who was the Leader of the
Opposition, concluded his speech in the Address-in-
Reply by moving a motion of want of confidence. It
was then perhaps that the forcefulness of the Premier
came to the surface, for he announced his intention of
following the issue to a decision, asserting that any
destructive tactics would be met by the last resort,
appeal to the people. And despite the intervening
passage of a Bill for temporary Supply he held to his
resolve. Mr. Bowman’s want of confidence motion was
only defeated by one vote, the numbers being 34 to 33.
The debate on the Address-in-Reply had carried
Parliament into August. As part of the proceedings
Mr. Airey, on the ruling of the Speaker, failed in his
attempt to direct attention to the Commonwealth and
State relations, the Speaker holding that the course was
barred by the Premier having given notice of a Supply
Bill, intended to be passed through the House in one
day. Mr. Airey’s motion that the Speaker’s ruling be
disagreed with, failed by 35 to 34. Then followed
motion and counter-motion, included in an all-night
sitting, and ultimately a motion by the Premier that the
House adjourn until August 24 was carried. Then there
was further bickering, subsequent to the announcement
by Mr. Kidston that, conditionally on Supply being
granted, he had advised His Excellency to dissolve the
House. Prior to this Mr. D. W. Armstrong, member
for Lockyer, had succeeded Mr. Maughan, who resigned
the Chairmanship of Committees. The vote for £990,000
was attended by great acidity of debate. The action of
the Speaker in voting was strongly questioned, while
the casting vote of the Chairman of Committees against
the balanced scale of 34 votes on either side aroused
angry laughter from the Opposition, the motion carried
being that of the Premier that the question be now put.
An amendment by Mr. Hardacre that one month’s
Supply be granted failed, and the closure being
applied, the quest for Supply full of political adventures
attained its goal, and the curtain was rung down on a
dissolution.


THE UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND.


The election took place on October 2 and was
strenuously contested, the numbers justifying the
Premier in the course he adopted, for the Ministerialists
returned stronger than ever, 41 members following Mr.
Kidston, while there were 27 for Labour, and 4
represented the Independent Opposition. The new
House affirmed its approval of the action of the late
Speaker, Mr. J. T. Bell, by re-appointing him. Again
Mr. Maughan’s supporters were in the minority, for
that gentleman was defeated in his candidature for the
Chair, numbers being 39 to 36. With the exception of
Mines and Works, the Ministers previously in office
resumed their portfolios. In the preceding Parliament
Mr. Jackson held the portfolios of Mines and Public
Works. In the new Parliament the Department of
Works was given to Mr. Barnes, who administered it in
addition to his previously held portfolio of Public
Instruction.
Several measures of historical importance became
law in the course of the session, and the legislative pro-
gramme was a mighty one, quite a sheaf of railway Bills
being included in the contemplated Parliamentary work.
The long-desired and long-sought coping stone was
placed on the educational structure during the year
1909, for in the first session of the eighteenth Parliament
the University of Queensland became an accomplished
fact; an Act providing for the government and control
of the institution was passed. The provisions concerning
appointment to the Senate and Council were most
liberal, and arrangements were made for the affiliation
when desired of collegiate bodies similar to the Gatton
Agricultural College or the School of Mines, Charters
Towers. In like manner provision for the educational
curriculum and status were extremely liberal, for even-
ing lectures were to be provided, while those unable to
attend the University course could obtain degrees and
diplomas after due examination. The privileges of the
University were made available for students of either
sex, and there were facilities for study, which was to be
free, for the benefit of prospective teachers who showed
in examination that they possessed educational status.
The foundation scholarships, of which there were 20
tenable for three years, with special provision for
students carrying on their studies away from home,
together with the foundation gold medal carrying
financial assistance to the extent of <£loo per annum for
two years, were available, as the Premier said,
“irrespective of class, creed, or sex.” There had been
much debate in days preceding the constitution of the
University concerning its site, but after all claims had
been considered and weighed it was generally conceded
that the Government had made the wisest and best
choice in devoting the old-time Government House and
Domain to academical education. The decision benefited
the Botanical Gardens to a marked extent, and gave
them not only much more ground for cultural purposes,
but also a much greater frontage to the river. The
Workers’ Dwellings Act entered on an extended field of
usefulness during the year. It may be pointed out that
the Board of Control provided for by the Act comprised
the Under-Secretaries of the Treasury and Public Works
Department, together with the Department of Justice,
the Under-Secretary to the Treasury being Chairman.
Yet another legislation destined to be a very important
factor in safeguarding the health of the twin cities on
either side of the Brisbane was to be found in the
Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Act, work in connec-
tion with this is supervised by a Board Representative
of North and South Brisbane with the Suburban Shires.
The time had now arrived when it was seen to be of
vital importance that the ports of the State should be
improved to a degree commensurate to some extent with
the tendency of the age to increase the tonnage of the
merchantmen, and also with the growing importance of
the marine trade of the State. A key to unlocking the
difficulties of navigation in the Brisbane River was
considered to have been found by the Harbour Board,
and the scheme of Mr. Cullen, Engineer of Harbours
and Rivers, aided, as that gentleman was by a
lengthened experience of the aftermath of floods,
promised to yield excellent results. The sum of .£82,000
was expended during the year in furtherance of a
comprehensive proposition in harbour improvements,
included in which was a channel 400 feet wide and with
a depth of 24 feet at low-water spring tides, the cost of
which was estimated at £93,000. Not only at the water-
way to the mother city of the State were harbour
improvements carried out, but there was good work done
at Cairns, Townsville, and as we have seen, at Rock-
hampton under the respective Harbour Boards. Beyond
that the fine natural harbour at Mourilyan was rendered
available by the removal of obstructions.
Nothing to be imagined could have more fittingly
celebrated the Golden Jubilee of autonomous government
in Queensland than the foundation of the Queensland
University, the dedication of Government House by the
new Governor, Sir William MacGregor, being the lead-
ing feature in the celebrations in honour of the auspicious
event on December 10, Sir William MacGregor having
arrived in Brisbane on the 2nd of the month. The
commemorations in honour of the State’s Jubilee were
heartfelt and enthusiastic, among the notable events of
the day being a message of congratulation from King
Edward VII. to the people of Queensland. During the
quinquennial period ending 1909 the number of cattle
in the State increased from 2,722,340 to 4,321,600, while
sheep showed an increase from 10,843,470 to 18,348,851.
The area of land selected in the five years rose from
1,658,128 acres to 4,902,314 acres. The value of wool
raised increased from £2,280,924 to £4,053,338, while


butter produced showed an increase in value from
£635,409 to £1,067,760. The value of sugar in 1904
was £1,860,225; in 1909 it was £2,146,395. The
tonnage of shipping inwards in 1904 was 949,601 and in
1909 1,601,107, while that of shipping outwards was in
the former year 958,792 and in the last of the five
years 1,563,911 tons. The railway receipts in 1904 were
£1,364,186 and in 1909 £1,985,084. Perchance one of
the best methods of grasping the difference between the
year of separation and the year of jubilee, fifty years
later, is to realize that in December, 1859, the population
was 25,020 and the revenue £178,589, while in 1909
the inhabitants of Queensland numbered 578,548 and
the revenue £5,119,235.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
ADVANCING PROSPERITY.
It could well be said of Queensland that the Jubilee
was something more than a commemoration of the past,
for it was a stage in national life whence the future
could be scanned and, more than that, whence full
assurance concerning the destined greatness of the coun-
try could be obtained. As Queensland looked ahead
month of February with the Adelaide Steamship Com-
pany by which both north and south were cared for as
to their producing interests, for provision was made for
the carriage of perishable foodstuffs, etc., from the
tropical coastal lands. Thus in some measure was the
aspiration of the late Hon. W. H. Groom fulfilled, for
BRISBANE FROM OBSERVATORY, LOOKING SOUTH, PRESENT DAY.
from the point of vantage of her years of accomplishment,
so in truth did Australia as a whole. The federated
States amid their thought of development were wise,
they determined to be prepared for all eventualities, and
so Field Marshal Lord Kitchener visited Australia to
advise the Federal Government concerning defence
affairs.
As will be inferred by what has been said the year
1910 was most prosperous as far as the material advance-
ment of the country was concerned, and plentiful rains
were experienced, so that the welfare of that which is
often termed the backbone of the country, farming, was
assured. The Government completed a contract in the
it may be remembered that that Queensland statesman in
the eighties, after acting as a member of the Parlia-
mentary Commission appointed to enquire into the sugar
industry, brought in a minority report in which he
recommended the substitution of fruit-growing for sugar-
planting in the tropical lands of the coast, together with
a system of transit to the South in swift steamers
equipped with cold storage facilities. It is strange that
after many years conditions in the fruit trade of the
Southern districts of the State, and also of the States in
the South, together with the aspect of the sugar industry
in relation to the future, should have given much more
strength to Mr. Groom’s arguments than they were


conceived to possess when they were first given to Parlia-
ment and the public. And the step taken by Mr.
Kidston’s Government in 1910 in regard to cold storage
on steamers trading from the North represented the
beginning of that which will bear great expansion.
On April 13 came the Federal elections which
placed the Fisher Administration in power. It had been
arranged that advantage should be taken of the occasion
to invite the electors to express their opinion by a
referendum vote on the financial agreement between the
Commonwealth and the States, and further that a sub-
ject which had aroused great interest should be placed
before the people for decision. The people were to decide
the much vexed question of “the Bible in State schools,”
as the proposal to amend the “State Education Act of
1875” was colloquially termed. In reference to the rela-
tions between the Commonwealth and the States the Con-
ference of Premiers held during August, 1909, had
decided that the States should receive 255. per capita of
population per annum, while the Commonwealth should
have authority to retain an amount not to exceed
£600,000 to provide for the shortage of revenue due to
the expiry of the Braddon clause system and to take
the place of that system. On the important point
whether that method of working should be embodied in
the Commonwealth Constitution the referendum was
taken. The electors expressed themselves against the
decision arrived at by the assembled Premiers of the
various States. The result, as explained by the State
Treasurer in Parliament, was that the States were
brought face to face with a large reduction of income.
Beyond this the Federal Government had deducted a
sum of £450,000, the amount of the deficit in Federal
revenue as at June 30, 1910, from the three-fourths of
revenue from Customs and Excise due to the States on
December 31. Mr. Hawthorn went on to say that
te’i-rh t>o of a Bill providing for an Aus-
tralian note issue the Treasury notes of Queensland
would be rendered valueless and a loss of £25,000
sustained. The Federal action would necessitate the
redemption of the whole of the Queensland Treasury
notes, of a value of £1,600,000. Arrangements, the
Treasurer explained, had been made for the redemption
of all the note issue by payment in gold. Such was the
outcome of the referendum in regard to Commonwealth
and State relations.
Turning to the other subject on which the people of
the State were asked to decide in referendum at the
Commonwealth general election—religious instruc-
tion in State schools—it has been held that the verdict
at the poll was not really an expression of opinion on
the part of the people. The fact, however, remains that
though only 53 per cent of the electors exercised the
privilege of the franchise on the subject, the verdict in
favour of Bible lessons in the State schools was
emphatically stated. The question had at its
base the much-debated subject of the relation
of the State to denominational schools and their
financial support, a point that had often been raised in
the past and which a wholly secular course of teaching
it was thought would have obviated. The State Educa-
tion Acts Amendment Bill, introduced to give effect to
the will of the people in referendum, became law on
November 24.
In the jmssing of the year there came a death,
fateful, as must always be the demise of kings. Edward
VII., after a reign in which he gave signal evidence of
ruling wisely and justly within the demarcations of a
constitutional monarchy, died after a short illness, and
was succeeded by George, Prince of Wales and Duke of
York, the heir-apparent to the throne, owing to the
death of his elder brother, the Duke of Clarence, in
1892 at the age of eighteen. To all Australians whose
memory takes thought into the time when the two
Princes visited the dominions under the Southern Cross
there must always be a touch of melancholy interest
in recalling to mind the two royal “middies” and
their mutual attachment. The elder was taken and the
younger as George Y. ascended the throne to rule in
times the most convulsive that have ever riven Europe.
It has often been said that each party in Parlia-
ment considers itself alone capable of carrying out good
land legislation, and this statement might be amplified
into the assertion that each session of Parliament
considers itself capable of bettering the land legislation
of the past. That there was a substantial stratum of
truth in the allegation is proved by the Herculean
labour which the amending codifying work during the
year 1910 represented to Parliamentarians. The best of
all that had been the law since the year 1838 was
selected. Part of that which had been legislative
enactments in New South Wales came under scrutiny
in this examination of the work of 73 years, and, as the
Minister stated, no less than 32 Acts of Parliament were
repealed. It was said that the work was on non-party
lines, and admiration for the excellent results attained
may surely not be withheld for party reasons. And yet
party crept in, for Labour averred that the reason why
the facilities for leasing had not been more largely
availed of was because the principle was kept in abey-
ance, while the system of freehold was placed prom-
inently before selectors. Be that as it may, or whether,
as was asserted by the Government, the favour shown by
prospective settlers for freehold was due to the desire
that the man on the land has to own the fields he tills,
we know not, but in the passage of the measure the
Minister gave his promise that the principle of perpetual
leases would be tested fully and fairly. Perhaps the
most important feature of the legislation was to be found
in the changes brought about in the Land Court, the


principle oi which, however, was not impugned. There
was criticism in the .House concerning the rents paid by
the pastoralists as compared with Crown tenants of
grazing farms. It is but just to point out that there
was never even a hint of a reflection on the impartiality
of the Land Board. Yet the attitude of the Government
led to the offer on the part of two members of the Land
Board, Messrs. Sword and Woodbine, to retire under
certain conditions, and retire they did in the ultimate.
In its process through the. two Houses the clauses
referring to the Land Board were so dealt with that it
was open to anyone of the members to retire on a
salary of ,£SOO per annum, being half their annual pay.
It was further decided that in the future the appoint-
ments should be tenable for fifteen years, there being
compulsory retirement at the age of sixty-five years. It
Government, a line running north from Wallal, a point
on the Cunnamulla line, north-west to Tobermory, 50
miles north of Thargomindah, and thence to Camooweal,
a far-north settlement which had sprung into existence
through pastoral enterprise in country which was near to
the confines of South Australia and south of a wonder-
fully fertile part of the State though little known then,
the Barkly Tableland. The masterful project entailed
an expenditure of over £4,000,000 sterling. Land-
holders in the benefited areas, amounting to
120,000,000 acres, were held responsible under
the guarantee system of railway construction for
the payment of 3 per cent. interest on the
cost of building the line. A glance at the map ot
Queensland will show the hardihood of the proposal, but
will demonstrate the utility of the project through the
BRISBANE FROM OBSERVATORY, LOOKING SOUTY-WEST, PRESENT DAY.
is a matter of moment to record the fact that the
Minister for Lands, Mr. D. F. Denham, who was a
member of the Legislative Assembly, addressed the
Upper House on the subject of the Land Bill, doing so
at the invitation of the Legislative Council.
All sections of the community, no matter what their
political belief, could not but acknowledge that the years
of which we write witnessed a boldness in railway con-
struction combined with a breadth of outlook never
before equalled in Queensland. Mr. Kidston thought
in millions and calculated in thousands of miles
in his proposal to aid enterprise and promote
settlement by means of the railroad. Popular
opinion first stood aghast and then was won to
warm approval by the comprehensive magnitude of the
proposals which represented the railway policy of the
H
development and safeguarding of the pastoral industry
in the State. But the great line from the south-west
to the Gulf did not stand alone. There was another
project complementary to it, the linking up of the
railway systems—Southern, Central, Northern, and Far-
Northern. North from Rockhampton the great trunk
line along the coast was to be pushed on until the railway
ramifications of the Mackay District, including the
Proserpine and Bowen branches were touched, and those
westward from Townsville and in the Cairns District,
with perchance even the seldom heard of Cooktown
railway; the building of railways was to go on until all
the lines were linked up, of which the whole would
represent a coastal trunk railway doing for the rich
agricultural lands of the coast what the line to the west
would do for that part of the State and great pastoral


interests. The cost of completing the coastal railway
was to be £2,320,000, that sum being exclusive of pay-
ments for land resumed. Of the country traversed by
the coastal trunk railway —some 11,000,000 acres —only
one-fifth was alienated. Those whose memory of and
interest in political events continues bright, will not
readily forget the gasp of astonishment which greeted
the issue by the leading newspapers of a sketch map
showing the proposed railway extensions. And nothing
could have been more inspiring than the proposals, for
between the coast and the west the scheme provided for
the extension of the railway lines already stretching
inland from the coast. Here also there was to be linking
lip and east and west, the coast and the plains of the far
North-West were to be united. At different points work,
it was decided, should be initiated simultaneously. Dur-
ing the following year, 1911, other features of a vigor-
ous railway policy were brought into evidence, and no
less than ten important branch lines were approved. The
Kidston Ministry and their successors had learnt one
part of their political lesson well, the relation of railways
to settlement. The railway proposals during 1910
entailed an expenditure of a sum which fell but little
short of £10,000,000 sterling.
The gigantic adventure into railway construction
does something more than stamp the Ministry with
enterprise, for only in the midst of successful seasons
and propitious weather conditions could a Government
have ventured so far afield from the beaten track of
political expediency. Splendid rains caused things to be
favourable in the agricultural industry, while the season,
as far as the pastoral industry was concerned, proved to
be the best that had been experienced for ten years.
Another very good sign was to be found in the fact that
the earning power of the State railways had increased to
the extent of £207,915, a very excellent evidence that
things were going well with the staple industries of the
country. Yet another proof that the State had taken
hold of fortune with both hands was to be found in the
fact that land and yet more land was being sought, the
total amount disposed of being 6,000,000 acres, or
1,000,000 acres in excess of the aggregate area of selec-
tions sought during the preceding year. The following
year showed a similar advance, for the land selected in
1911 totalled 7,000,000 acres. During the year the wool
borne on the Great Northern railway totalled 64,209
bales, or an increase, of 10,000 bales compared with the
carriage of wool in 1909. In 1910 the amount of butter
produced at the Warwick factory was in all 868 tons 16
cwt., the cream dealt with representing a value of
£73,853. In the following year the same butter
company declared a profit of £2,200. Notable
indeed was the expansion of the dairying industry as
evinced in 1910, when the total value of production
represented £1,500,000 sterling. Dairying had so forged
ahead that it gave employment to no less that 11,529
men and 11,419 women.
Seldom has a Treasurer been given a more pleasant
task than fell to the lot of Mr. W. H. Barnes in his
financial statement in regard to the year 1910-11, and
it must have been with something of patriotic pride that
the Minister pointed out that the year he was reviewing
showed an increase in revenue of 50 per cent, as com-
pared with 1909-10. And that fact is in no wise affected
by the accompanying experience that the expenditure
had increased to the extent of 45 per cent. The actual
revenue, £5,320,008, was an advance of £276,801 on
the estimate. A significant feature of the speech was
the announcement in regard to the last State loan,
which it was shown had been more economically floated
in London than would have been possible under the
conditions offered by the Commonwealth Government.
It would seem to be one of the larger laws by which
a Ministry, following the laws of empires, touches the
pinnacle of success and usefulness, and finds that beyond
there is a declining and a falling away. No one blames
Mr. Kidston for seizing opportunity as it came on full
wing. He had achieved ; a severe trial had come to him
in the death of Mrs. Kidston, while his own health
hardly seemed robust enough to stand the strain of
leading his party into further fields of conquest. And
so it came that in February, 1911, it was intimated that
the Premier had resigned office and had been appointed
to a vacant seat on the Land Board, where in truth his
decisions and rulings have proved that his mental gifts
went far beyond the scope of the purely political. A
hard-headed Scot, by no means devoid of that touch of
humour which Sydney Smith would deny his country-
men, all political cults rejoiced at the academical degree
of Doctor of Laws conferred on him pro causa honoris
by the University of Glasgow.
Mr. D. F. Denham assumed the Leadership of the
Government in succession to Mr. Kidston. Again there
was a shuffle of the Ministerial cards, for Mr. K. M. Grant
became Minister for Education, Mr. E. H. Macartney
Minister for Lands, while Mr. James Tolmie took charge
of the Department of Agriculture. Mr. A.G. C. Hawthorn
resigned the portfolio of the Treasury, being succeeded by
Mr. W. H. Barnes. To Mr. W. T. Paget, one of the
members for Mackay, was given the Department of
Railways. Mr. J. G. Appel became Home Secretary.
The Ministerial representation in the Upper House
remained unchanged, Mr. Thomas O’Sullivan continu-
ing in the Attorney-Generalship and Mr. Barlow as
Minister without portfolio. Mr. Hawthorn became a
Legislative Councillor. Perhaps those who studied most
closely political events would have said that the recon-
structed Ministry, though strong, was not so strong as
when Mr. Kidston held the reins. Why, it would
be difficult to say, yet it was not long before


whispers, sub rosd, were heard and heard again hinting
at dissensions in the Cabinet, innuendoes pointing
always to the fact that the members of the Ministry
were not a happy family. Labour during those days
came to the front as it had never done before. Despite a
stout resistance and many a rally the Denham Govern-
ment was to go down before Labour.
The appointment of Mr. W. Main as State Immigra-
tion Agent was made in February to promote the coming
to Queensland of agricultural labourers. In the same
month it is interesting, in the light of events then in the
future, to note that a number of Russian immigrants
arrived in Brisbane travelling by the Japanese liner
“Nikko Maru.” In the following month, March, the
steamer “Suffolk - ’ brought fifty-two immigrants, and
the steamers “Otranto” and “Kumano Maru” 120 new
settlers. These facts, together with the readiness of
farmers in the Atherton District to mortgage their
holdings, valued conjointly at £BO,OOO, for the purpose
of securing a sugar mill under the Guarantee Act, and
the further important point that the State Sugar Mills
Commissioner recommended that crushing and manu-
facturing works should be erected at the Russell,
Johnstone, and Burdekin Rivers, gave excellent evidence
that Queensland was advancing in one of the most
important phases of national prosperity, the primary
industry of agriculture. Yet there was heard the
muttering of the storm so soon to break in antagonism
between the State and the Commonwealth, for early in
the year the State Government declined an offer of the
Federal Ministry—Labour, with Mr. A. Fisher as Prime
Minister, being in the seats of the mighty. For the
ourning question involved in the principle that the
States should manage their domestic affairs was to be
tested in an appeal to the people in referendum. It
was said at the time that the question endowing the
Commonwealth Government with supreme power in
regard to trade and commerce on the one hand, and the
management of labour and employment on the other,
represented as important a point to be decided by the
electors as that in regard to the constitution of Federal
relations. It is not exaggeration to say that never was
public feeling so greatly excited as it was in regard to
the referendum proposals, and in Queensland, as through-
out the Commonwealth, the most vigorous of campaigns
was carried out by both political parties. The electors
declared emphatically against the system, the aggregate
majorities against the proposals recorded at the poll
taken on February 20 being 304,348 in negation of
changing the Constitution to give the Commonwealth
the legislative powers sought, while that against mono-
polies was 247,724. There was no doubt as to the views
of the people in regard to the relations between the
Commonwealth and the States, and more emphatic was
the pronouncement in Queensland than elsewhere.
In March, 1911, there came one of those devastating
cyclones which sweep in from the ocean and carry havoc
and desolation ashore after wrecking stout ships off the
coast. Cairns felt the terrific force of the hurricane,
and on the waters of the northern coast, for the most
part calm with lake-like surface, a tragedy of the sea
was enacted. The “Yongala,” a fine ship of the Adelaide
Steamship Company’s fleet, steamed into the hurricane
and was never seen again. Search after search was
made, but save for the certainty that the vessel had
gone to pieces on a reef, nothing very definite was
ascertained. It seems fateful that the fore-and-aft
schooner “Norna,” of Thursday Island, which was
chartered to search for the wreck of the “Yongala,” for
the discovery of which the Government had offered a
reward of £I,OOO, was herself wrecked, being driven by
heavy weather on one of the sunken reefs inside the
Barrier Reef.
In May, 1911, came a new departure worthy ot
mention, for in that month Australia fell into line with
the Imperial Parliament in introducing penny postage
in the Commonwealth, as the system had already been
applied to the Empire as far as the British Government
could deal with the subject.
Among the legislative measures of the year was
the Mackay Harbour Board Amendment Act, which
provided for an extensive and comprehensive scheme by
which the port would be given deep water and rendered
accessible to the largest of steamers without the expense
and delay inseparable through lighterage from Flat Top.
The Bill provided for the expenditure of £370,000
obtained through loan for the work. The scheme was
modified, and later on, May 22, 1913, approval was
given by the Government for a loan of £250,000 towards
cost of new harbour works.
In 1912 there' came a struggle between employers
and employes which threatened at one time to develop
almost into war conditions, and which at all events
brought all the discomforts, privations, and hardships
of a beleaguered town upon the citizens of Brisbane. It
is significant, perhaps, that on January 17 there should
have been a meeting of the local authorities interested
to consider a proposed Bill to acquire and manage the
Brisbane Tramways, while on the next day, the 18th,
there should be so great trouble in the tramways service
that on the evening of that day the running of the cars
had to be suspended. The dissatisfaction among the
employes was due to the prohibition in the regulations
of the company against wearing trades union badges. A
principle was doubtless at stake, but beyond that incon-
testable fact there seemed little either on the one side
or the other to cause a ruinous dislocation of industrial
life. Things developed very rapidly, yet, despite an
attempt to wreck the electric power-house, the trams
gave a twelve-hours’ service almost throughout the


whole of the strike, which the union leaders decided
should become general if no arrangement were arrived
at on January 30. No basis of agreement had been
reached when 6 o’clock of the day in question came, and
so a general strike became a fact as far as Brisbane was
concerned. Feeling ran high and indignation was
aroused in communities other than the capital at the
hardship and loss brought about, especially by the
dislocation of the coastal traffic. With the exception of
Townsville very little was done, apart from the
disciplined obedience to the orders of militant unionists,
to evince sympathy with the tramway employes. Mean-
while the citizens of Brisbane suffered much incon-
venience. Food was very difficult to procure.
A significant feature of the disturbances was the
refusal of the Federal Government to accede to the
request of the Premier (Mr. Denham) for troops to
quell the disturbances and restore law and order. It
is well to place on record the resolute and yet temperate
firmness which Mr. Denham displayed, and it is not
necessary to refer in detail to the grand services ren-
dered by the police and special constables, both under
the admirably wise and determined leadership of Major
Cahill, Commissioner of Police, who sternly forbade
processions. As the days of unrest went on things
became more difficult, the suburban train service being
suspended. Bread had now reached famine pi’ices.
With the coming of volunteer troopers from Esk and
Lockyer, who had seen service in the Boer War and who
enrolled as special constables, the fear lest revolution
might raise its gaunt head was relieved, and other
volunteer troopers from Beaudesert showed the way
things might go. Thenceforth, though the inconvenience
and disturbances dragged on wearily until the last week
in March, the conclusion of the whole matter had long
been anticipated. Mr. Justice Higgins ordered a com-
pulsory conference between employers and employes, the
delivery of bread was resumed, and the strikers as well
as the general public longed for a return to normal con-
ditions. On March 7 the High Court of the Common-
wealth granted an order nisi in the case of an appeal to
prevent the award in regard to the wearing of badges
being enforced. So ended the great strike in Brisbane.
During the year 1912, and as a consequence, the
Denham Government laid the State under a strong
obligation by the forceful yet immensely common-sense
provision of the Industrial Peace Bill, which passed
through Parliament and became law. Power was given
to the judge exercising jurisdiction under the Act to
mediate or compel conferences in the disputes between
employers of twenty men on the one hand or twenty
employes on the other. Power to make or unmake
Industrial Boards was vested in the Industrial Court,
and as the main feature of the Act lock-outs or strikes
were prohibited in the case of public utilities, while in
any cases there must be no strike or lockout until there
had been fourteen days’ notice given in writing and
after a secret ballot had been taken. So highly was the
tenor of the Act thought of and the wisdom of its pro-
visions appreciated that it called forth strong com-
mendations not only in Australia but in the United
Kingdom. Mr. D. F. Denham gave excellent reason for
his existence as Premier in the Industrial Peace Act.
Yet another important legislative proposition
became law in the year of which we write, for the Liquor
Bill, in regard to which it had been found impossible to
arrive at any finality in the previous session, and in
connection with which there began to be talk of an
appeal to referendum, became law in 1912, tact having
settled the differences as between the two Houses of
Parliament. The measure practically placed the control
of the liquor traffic, the number of public houses, or
whether there should be any at all in a given district,
in the control of the people speaking at a local option
poll. The licensing authority under the law was by no
means bereft of its powers, but was assisted to good
purpose by public opinion and decision.
A greatly generous action during the year
falls to be chronicled, for the Premier received
advice on May 24 that Mrs. W. R. Hall had
donated the interest of a sum of one million sterling in
memory of her late husband, one-fourth of which was to
come to Queensland, New South Wales receiving one-
half of the amount allotted, and Victoria one-quarter.
During the year Mr. J. Bryce, wdio subsequently became
Lord Bryce, and who was then the British Ambassador
to the United States, visited Queensland, and in con-
junction with the Governor, the late Sir William Mac-
Gregor, was presented with the honorary degree of
Doctor of Laws by the Queensland University.
Parliament dissolved in March and preparations for
the forthcoming elections were instituted, a novel feature
in electioneering campaigns being introduced by Mr.
E.W.H. Fowles in his candidature for Fortitude Valley,
where cinematograph pictures were used. The poll took
place on April 27, the number of electors on the rolls
being stated to be 313,498. As the result of the appeal
to the people 47 Liberals, 24 Labourites, and one
Independent were returned to Parliament. Among
those whose addresses were rejected were Messrs. E. B.
Forrest, M. A. Ferricks, Stephens, Mann, MacLachlan,
Hyland, Mulcahy, Maughan, and I). Hunter, all of
whom had seats in the late Parliament. It will
be seen that substantial approval of the policy of Mr.
Denham was expressed by the electors.
Rain fell plentifully, over-plentifully in some dis-
tricts, during the year 1913, and as a result pastoral
and agiicultural enterprises were in part prosperous.
The Government seemed sympathetic, and things went
exceedingly well in the State. The shipment of cheese


which left on January 8, totalled 1,400 cases, valued at
nearly £2,000, and bore witness to the fact that the
dairying products of the State stood high in the London
market, and this satisfactory conclusion was further
justified by a record cargo of butter which was sent to
England in the “Argyllshire” some seven weeks later,
amounting in all to 28,536 boxes, valued at £71,340.
Returns of the stock in Queensland at the beginning of
the year showed that the number of horses totalled
665,599, an increase of 46,645 compared with the
previous annual period. In cattle there was an increase
of 136,443, the total number being 5,209,644. In regard
to sheep and swine there were decreases, representing
492,401 in the former and 31,075 in the latter. The
total number of sheep was 20,248,580 and of swine
142,820. During the year the record price at that time
was obtained for 600 cattle which were bred on Sesbania
Station and sold for £8 per head, being jmrchased by
the general advance towards prosperity that the State
was enjoying, and in the first month the revenue showed
a net increase of £IO,OOO compared with the correspond-
ing period of the previous year. During the year the
Minister for Railways (Mr. Paget) opened the line from
Mackay to Sarina, and also that from Rockhampton
to Jardine, both being sections of the northern trunk
railway. The turning of the first sod of the Mount
Mulligan railway was performed by the Governor on
May 19, while on the 24th of that month the Premier
performed a similar ceremony in connection with the
line from Pialba to Urangan. On August 4 and 22
respectively construction work was ceremoniously initi-
ated by the Minister for Railways in connection with the
line from Dalby to Jandowae and from Logan Village
to Canungra.
In casting a glance into the past it is very worthy of
mention to recall the honour paid to one whose memory
FRUITY FAMS IN THE MT. BUDERIM DISTRICT.
the Alligator Creek Meatworks Company at Townsville.
What the rich agricultural land of the State
could yield was shown by the return won by Mr. J.
Bell, of Maryvale, who raised no less than twenty-five
tons of pumpkins from acres.
In the course of 1913 a departure that had been
often urged was taken, for the Brisbane Fruitgrowers’
Co-operative Company established a factory in Stanley
Street, South Brisbane, for manufacturing jam and
canning pineapples, the plant for operating the latter
work being capable of dealing with 12 tons gross of tins
per diem. Turning to another important agricultural
industry, which for some unknown reason seemed to
be confined to the country not far from the southern
border, we find that the total area devoted to growing
tobacco in the Texas and Inglewood Districts was 652|
acres.
During the year the railway receipts responded to
of work shared in municipal government extended over
forty-two years, and whose residence in Queensland
began four years previous to Separation, for in the
course of the year Alderman McMaster was the recipient
of well-merited recognition of faithful services in local
government affairs, being presented by his civic well-
wishers with a purse of 500 sovereigns.
In furtherance of higher education, as well as the
advancement of medical science and healing, the year
with which we are dealing brought events, notable in
their importance, for King’s College, in affiliation with
the University, was opened officially by the Governor,
who during his whole tenure of office displayed
the keenest interest in educational affairs and the
advancement of scientific methods. His Excellency Sir
William MacGregor further performed the inaugural
ceremony in connection with the Institute of Tropical
Medicine at Townsville.


CHAPTER XXXVII.
IN THE THROES OF THE GREAT WAR.
The year to which our review of incidents in the
national life of Queensland has brought us was momen-
tous in the history of the world, for the second half of
the annual period had hardly begun when the Great
War came. Throughout its length and breadth Aus-
tralia was destined to feel the vivifying touch of
devoted unselfishness through and in the war;
and it is strange, for it seems as though we
dealt with quite another world, to note that in the first
half of 1914 things pursued their wonted and time
honoured course in the State. We were so far away
from the jangle and discord of European squabbles and
international jealousies that they had no interest for us,
were as things apart from our lives, and then at the
signal of a pistol shot in Eastern Europe the flames of
destruction broke out and Queensland, as all the States,
was one with the Empire as she never was before in
staying the conflagration of barbarism.
The records of the year in days prior to
the war bore witness to but one fact, the
advancing tide of prosperity. The sugar crop at Mackay
was calculated at between 40,000 and 50,000 tons, while
the farms on the rich alluvial upper flats of the Mary
River and the no less fertile slopes of Mount Bauple were
estimated to yield 40,000 tons of cane for crushing at
the central mill there. In the North, in the Cairns
district, cane-growing went on successfully, as was
proved by the output of sugar at the Mulgrave Central
Mill, amounting to over 10,000 tons. In the Roma
District the area of land under cultivation for wheat was
reported to show a large increase on that of previous
years, for several thousands of acres had been put under
crop, which was looking well. The official returns
published during the year showed that the agricultural
crops in the State during the previous twelve months
were valued at £6,241,022, while the value of the wool
clip was £6,296,000. The amount of land selected
during eleven months of the year 1914 represented a
total of 7,564,150 acres, the rentals therefrom being in
all £42,957. As it was with arable farming so it was
with the pastoral industry, and the excellent results of
the sale of grazing properties during the first half of the
year bore witness to the fact that before the war came
and the price of meat, as well as of all foodstuffs, went
up, the raising of stock in the State stood for great
prosperity. Among the stations sold was
Downs” in the St. George district, with 52,000 sheep,
250 cattle, and 50 horses, purchased by Hearn Bros.,
of Victoria, for £90,000. The travelling of stock on the
Northern Railway implied busy times, for it is stated
that a record in cattle-trucking was attained, 1,380
cattle being put on a train in seven hours. Yet another
record was established, for in June the meatworks at
Ross River surpassed all other similar industrial centres
in Australia by dealing with 1,772 cattle in one day.
Very notable in the history of the pastoral industry was
the purchase during the course of the year by the Morris
Meat Company of a site on the Brisbane River for
building large works for dealing with meat for export.
Worthy of mention in stock-raising in Queensland is
the killing of a sheep in the Roma District which
weighed when dressed no less than 190 lbs. The skin
measured 51 inches by 50 inches. The record-breaking
animal was the property of Mr. D. Ross of Dingwell.
Of great interest in connection with the mining
industry was the discovery of molybdenite, one of the
most valuable of industrial minerals other than precious
metal. Molybdenite was found at Bamford, in the
Cairns district. Later at Wolfram Camp, Mareeba,
eight tons of the metal, used extensively in making the
toughest steel, were sold at the rate of £462 per ton.
Subsequently it was reported that deposits of molyb-
denite had been unearthed at Stanthorpe. Not only
were discoveries and developments in metals reported,
for there were also large finds of gems to the value of
£40,000 at Sapphiretown, together with precious stones
for mechanical purposes valued at £5,000. And in the
seeking there was also laid bare relics of a bygone age in
stone tomahawks, a stone chisel, together with human
bones.
Parliament met in July, 1914, and a list
of useful measures was presented and for the most part
became law. The following comprehensive programme
in railway construction was approved: —Cloncurry to
Mount Cuthbert (second section); Dirranbandi exten-
sion; Enoggera to Terrors Creek; Gatton to Mount
Silvia; Goondoon towards Kalliva Creek; Inglewood to
Texas and Silver Spur; Lanefield to Rosevale; Malanda
to Millaa Millaa; Miles to Taroom (second section);
Mount Russell to Cecil Plains; Mundubbera to the
Northern Burnett; Murgon to Proston and branch to
Windera; Rockhampton to Alton Downs; Tara towards
Surat; via Recta-Mount Edwards to Maryvale. Parlia-
ment also validated the taking over of the Mount Garnet
railway by the Government.
It is not within the scope of this work to deal
with the war, save to record with glowing pride the
answer to the call of battle which the flower of the State
gave in defence of the freedom of the world and the
safety of the Empire. On land and sea in all the war
zones were Queenslanders and Australians as a whole
found, and in the self-sacrifice of her sons their country


found confidence and assurance concerning her freedom
through all time. In the capture of the German raider
“Emden by the “Sydney,” the seizure of German New
Guinea by an Australian force and the occupation of the
annexed possessions the men of the Commonwealth
showed their prowess, as did the New Zealand force in
the capture of Samoa, while the heroism at Gallipoli
will never be forgotten. In Mesopotamia, Syria, and
Palestine, in the long vigils in the desert and watch and
ward kept at the Suez Canal our troops will ever be
remembered. On the Western Front no less did the men
from the Austral lands muster and nobly did they write
history, many alas with their blood. The war came and
the war lias passed, but the deeds of the Anzacs have
without portfolio. The passing of Mr. Barlow removed
one who had for many years served the State faithfully
and effectively in no less than seven Administrations,
and through all his labours had won the reputation of
a man always eager to do the right and faithful in
the doing of it. His demise was regretted by a circle
far outside of politics. Mr. Douglas joined the Cabinet
as Minister without portfolio.
When the general election cam© on May 22, 1915, it
was found that Labour had secured 45 seats as against
21 supporters of the Liberal Party, there being five
representatives of the farmers and one Independent.
During the first months of the new year there came a
change in the vice-regal representation, Major Sir
LEISNER BLOCK, WOLFRAM MINES.
been written in imperishable letters upon the scroll of
fame.
With the passing of 1914 things in Parliament
began to wear a different aspect for the Government,
and the coming year was to show that even if the Minis-
try had not changed, the views of the supreme arbiters in
the fate of Cabinets, the electors, had altered. Changes in
the Ministry took place early in 1915 while Parliament
was in recess, for Lieut.-Colonel Rankin succeeded Mr.
Paget as Secretary for Railways, while Mr. K. M.
Grant went to the Home Office and also administered the
Mines Department in lieu of Mr. J. G. Appel. And
yet another change in the personnel of the Cabinet was
due to the death of the Hon. A. H. Barlow, Minister
Hamilton John Goold-Adams, succeeding Sir William
MacGregor, who might fittingly be said to have
stood quite apart from all others in the fulfilment of
his duties as Governor, through the almost fatherly
interest he took in the people of the State and all
pertaining to their welfare. In July, 1919, came tidings
from Scotland, received with deep regret, that Sir
William MacGregor had passed away.
The Ministry who received a mandate from the
people to take office was as follows: —Premier, Chief
Secretary, Attorney-General, and Vice-President of the
Executive Council, Mr. T. J. Ryan; Treasurer and
Secretary for Public Works, Mr. E. G. Theodore;
Home Secretary, Mr. D. Bowman; Secretary for


Railways, Mr. John Adamson; Secretary for Public
Instruction, Mr. H. F. Hardacre; Secretary for Public
Lands, Mr. J. M. H unter; Secretary for Agriculture and
Stock, Mr. W. Lennon ; Ministers without portfolio, Mr.
J. Huxham and Mr. J. A. Fihelly. With this Adminis-
tration there came an emphatic change in the policy for
governing the State.
Among the measures passed in Queensland in 1915 it
is to be noted that there were quite a number of
laws arising from and due to the war, among them
being the Sugar Acquisition Act, enabling the State
Government to acquire the whole of the crop of sugar
cane during the year in order to act in conjunction with
the Federal Government, the measure also authorizing
the extension of the powers under the Act to any food-
stuffs, goods, and chattels, together with live stock. An
effort to solve the ever-recurring problem of the price of
cane was made by an Act providing for the constitution
of a Central Board together with Local Boards, which
were granted the right of appeal to the Central Board.
The Workers’ Accommodation Act generalized measures
passed in reference to shearers and sugar workers. Other
measures of moment were Land Tax and Income Tax
Acts. The former measure placed the minimum of
taxation at £3OO, the impost rising from Id. in the
pound to 6d. in the pound. Land not developed bore a
heavier tax than that in use. In the Income Tax Act the
payments ranged in the case of personal exertion from
to Is. 6d. in the pound, while property was taxed
at a rate varying from 12d. to 20d. in the pound j the
incomes of absentees were taxed at a higher rate, and
public utility or monopoly companies paid on a yet
higher scale up to 36d. in the pound. The Treasurer
(Mr. Theodore) in his financial statement explained that
the land and income taxes were introduced for the
purpose of meeting during the year a deficit estimated
at £370,564, the income tax being calculated to yield
£210,000 and the land tax £165,000, or a total amount
of some £4,500 more than the deficit. Signs of the time
were very apparent in the Constitution Amendment Act,
which had as its object the abolition of the Legislative
Council. The Upper House having exercised to the full
its powers in sundry measures had certainly not tended
to weaken the penchant of the Labour Party for a single
Legislative Chamber. It is of importance to recall the
fact that in June of the year under consideration Mr.
E. LI. Macartney was chosen Leader of the Opposition,
while Lieut.-Colonel Rankin became Deputy Leader.
Mr. Macartney, however, tendered his resignation of the
position on September 8 by reason of ill-health. Mr. J.
Tolmie succeeded the member for Toowong in the
Leadership of the Opposition.
Among the events in the sphere of farming were the
prices paid for 100 selections on the Cochin Estate, the
aggregate amount received being £56,574, while in the
sugar industry the Moreton Central Sugar Mill showed
a profit of £2,909. It is also interesting to note that
the Marburg cane suppliers were being paid 255. per
ton, including payment for cane tops used as fodder.
These facts are interesting as both the districts in
question are considered to be further south than is
deemed advisable in regard to sugar-growing. All the
more are the facts of interest as it was calculated later
on in the year that there would be a shortage of 32,000
tons in the sugar crop by reason of the dry season.
Against that untoward experience may be recorded a
shipment of Queensland butter which the steamer
“Carpentaria” took to London and which was valued
at £IOB,OOO. Pastoral affairs were feeling the reaction
of the war in enhancing prices, and as an evidence of the
expansion of the grazing industry may be mentioned
the announcement that the Gladstone District was to
be benefited by the establishment of meat works at
Police Creek, some three miles from the town, in
addition to the very successful and prosperous works at
Parson’s Point.
Turning to another important asset of the State it
is of interest to record that the gold yield in the month
of March represented an increase of £28,706 conqiared
with the similar period of the previous year. As an
evidence that the mineral products of the North to
which we have referred were deemed of great importance
by the Ministry, there was an intimation on the jaart of
the Government of an intention to erect a plant at
Bamford, in the Cairns District, for the purpose of
treating molybdenite and wolfram ores.
As an indication of the manner in which mercantile
affairs and maritime trade of the State, coastal, and
overseas were enlarging it may be mentioned that new
wharves and sheds were built to the order of the South
Brisbane Town Council at a cost of £II,OOO, being
completed early in the year. Yet other indications of
progress and prosperity were to found in the sale of the
corner of Queen Street and Albert Street, formerly
occupied by Messrs. Grimes & Petty, the purchasing
price being £65,000. The year also saw the flotation by
the Q.N. Bank of their station properties into a Com-
pany with a cash capital of £859,000.
In the year 1916, as in all the long-protracted
anxious times of the terrible struggle in the various war
zones, the masterful influence in family and social life,
politics and commerce, was the war. How the State
responded, not only by giving of her best in her sous
who volunteered, but also of her wealth, may be realized
by the fact that in January the Queensland Patriotic
Fund stood at £388,808, while six months later, on
June 26 the amount raised had risen to £411,899. On
April 25 Anzac Day was celebrated by divine services at
the camps and churches, together with public meetings
and a march of troops through Brisbane, 6,434 soldiers


taking part in the review. Later, on August 4, came the
second anniversary of the war, and yet despite the
patriotic fervour which blazed up brightly the decision
of the State, as of the Commonwealth, was very strongly
expressed in regard to conscription, for the referendum
which took place on October 28 showed that 151,101
electors were opposed to the system, 143,051 being in
favour of compulsory service. In the Commonwealth as
a whole the voting was 1,084,918 for and 1,146,198
against conscription.
A stimulus was given to dairy farming, apart from
the rise in prices due to the war directly, by an order
received from the Indian Government in June for
900,000 lb. of cheese. Signs of the times in
advancing settlement were also afforded in the purchase
by the Government of Cecil Plains, one of the best
June rain fell so heavily in the West that a projected
visit of His Excellency the Governor to that jjart of the
State was perforce abandoned. As the year waned to
its close a cyclone which swept over the Mackay District
was attended by torrential rain. Very heavy rains were
did Clermont suffer, floods devastating the place and
resulting in terrible privations, injury to joroperty and
also experienced in the Central Division, and especially
still the greater calamity, the loss of life. And yet
another disaster, this time in the industrial sphere, fell
on Queensland during the year, for owing to a dispute
between colliery owners and their employes concerning
working hours and other questions the miners were all
called out by the Central Trades Union Executive in
September, and as a result all trams and trains in
the metropolitan area ceased work. Fortunately for the

known and most valuable station properties on the
Darling Downs, which was acquired for the purpose of
being cut up into selections at a purchasing price of £2
per acre. It is interesting, in testimony of the relation
of the State railways to the pastoral industry and the
advantages of transport they offered as compared with
the old-time system, to note that out of 10,000 sheep des-
patched by rail from Aramac to Dirranbandi only one
animal died in transit. During the year the record
price for wool was attained at the sales at Brisbane,
3s. 9d. per lb. being realized. This was very nearly
equalled at Sydney, where 3s. Slid. was paid for wool
from Darr River Downs. During the year phenomenal
downpours of rain were experienced. At Babinda, in
the North, no less than 22'40 inches were recorded early
in the year, that deluge falling within 48 hours. In
State an understanding was arrived at by October 4, and
most of the coalminers had resumed work.
The programme of the Parliamentary session which
began on August 22 gave promise of much business, and
the measures members were invited to consider included
the Bills which had in the previous session proved dis-
tasteful to the Upper Chamber, with a view it was
astutely believed to recourse to the Parliamentary Bills
Referendum Act. The proposed measures were the
Industrial Arbitration Bill; the Commonwealth Powers
(War) Bill; the Meat Works Bill; the Laud Act
Amendment Bill; together with the Bill to abolish the
Upper House, the Popular Initiative and Referendum
Bill, with a measure to abolish Capital Punishment.
Far reaching and comprehensive the policy was, but the
Government did not escape criticism, for after the


Assembly had been in session for some six weeks the
Leader of the Opposition, Mr. James Tolmie, moved for
a vote of want of confidence in the Ministry “by reason
of the disloyal utterances of the Hon. John Fihelly,
Acting Minister for Justice, and the Hon. William
Lennon, Minister for Agriculture, as appearing in the
Catholic Advocate newspaper of Thursday, September 7,
and The Daily Mail newspaper of Tuesday, September
19, and generally for its failure to adequately assist at
the present juncture the Empire in its need of reinforce-
ment for the troops in the field.” The motion was
defeated, an amendment by the Treasurer being carried
to the effect that the Government “possesses the full
confidence of this House by reason of its capable hand-
ling of all problems with which it is faced.” The
voting was 42 for the amendment against 24 for the
motion. Feeling ran very high at the time, and of this
the members of the Opposition, and we may add sup-
porters of the Government, gave token by rising and
singing “God Save the King.”
In November came the financial statement. It
anticipated a deficit of £158,076 and looked to two new
“resting places” in the scheme of income taxation with
increased imposts, together with a super tax on incomes
larger than £4OO to yield the required sum lacking in
revenue. Before the session and the year closed the
Industrial Arbitration Bill and the Land Tax Amend-
ment Bill became law, but it was not so with the
measure to abolish the Upper House.
The House adjourned on December 22, and but two
days before the business of the year was brought to a
close there passed hence one of whom Queenslanders
should be proud —Sir Arthur Morgan, President of the
Legislative Council. Kindly, well intentioned, broad-
minded, and capable he achieved and succeeded. He
could ill be spared and was deeply mourned.
With the new year, 1917, there came heavy rains
in the North and also in Central Queensland. A flood
swept “Majuba” Station bare of livestock, the losses
including 100,000 sheep. Later it was reported that the
Flinders was in flood; the river rose higher than was
ever known during thirty-five years. Not only was the
loss of stock very serious but there was a toll on human
lives, six persons being drowned. Some two weeks sub-
sequently tidings from the south-western districts showed
that St. George and Goondiwindi were suffering from
excessive rains. As the days passed Charleville and
Cheepie reported floods, while in the metropolitan dis-
trict a heavy storm raised a record by the fall of an inch
of rain in twenty-five minutes.
The war went well for the Allies during the year.
Patriotism was burning brightly, and already
men —and women too—were throwing the energy
of their souls into providing for the homecoming
of the Australian soldiers, and their future after
their return. Among the grandly generous gifts
to the men who served was land for their uses,
7,075 acres of country on “Tantitha” Station being
donated by Moore Bros., of ‘‘Barambah’ Station,
the gift being all the more generous as it was unhedged
by any conditions. Anzac Day witnessed the appeal of
the Young Men’s Christian Association for aid and the
grand response of the public of £30,000. France’s Day
was bright and loaded with the deepest fraternal emotion
in admiration of our great Ally. The Franco-Queens-
land League of Help was successful in raising £15,340.
During the course of the year Queensland
experienced trouble through strike difficulties and
the consequent dislocation of business. The strike
of 300 employes of the various bacon factories
in the Brisbane District was settled by the
employers agreeing to give the men an advance of 10
per cent, in wages. A stoppage of work on the part of
1,600 employes at Mount Morgan was more serious, but
an escape from the difficulty was found. The strike
arose from the refusal of the management to dismiss a
non-unionist worker. The most extensive trade dispute
was the strike of the railwaymen at work in the Mackay
District and northward. It was due to the refusal of the
Department to grant retrospective pay to all employes
on the Northern railway. The difficulty was intensified
by the stoppage of the coastal trade through the crews
of the steamers coming out in sympathy with the rail-
waymen. After the strike had existed for eighteen days
the men in Mackay went back to work on August 24. The
employes on the Townsville line continued off work for
some time longer. A movement on the part of Mr.
Ryan to overcome the strike difficulty in the coastal
steamers by taking over three steamers under the
authority of the Sugar Acquisition Act of 1915 which
dealt with subjects other than its title betokened was
met by action on the part of the Prime Minister, Mr.
Hughes, who forbade the commandeering of the
vessels, superseding the authority and law of the State
by that of the Commonwealth. In Brisbane commercial
men assembled to pass resolutions condemnatory of the
attitude of the Government in regard to the northern
strike and the holding up of the shipping trade.
In March, 1917, came a cause celehre before the
Supreme Court, or rather the first act in the judicial
drama, for judgment was given in what was termed the
Mooraberrie cattle case, in which Mrs. Duncan and
F. C. Trotman sued the Treasurer of Queensland and
his Under-Secretary, claiming damages for trespass and
seizure of cattle. On March 24 the jury gave their
verdict awarding £2,900 damages to plaintiffs, with the


alternative judgment of £9OO if the proclamation of
the Government in regard to acquiring cattle was
warranted by law. The Premier, Mr. Ryan, took the
suit under appeal to the High Court of Australia. The
Judges of that Jurisdiction supported the finding of the
State Court. Not content, Mr. Ryan made a final
appeal, taking the case to the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council. In London the decisions of the Aus-
tralian Courts, State and Federal, were reversed—rather
a mark of Mr. Ryan’s pronounced ability as a member
of the Bar.
In the following month yet another judgment
affecting the Ministry was given, the Full Court deciding
that the referendum
proposed to be held
concerning the aboli-
tion of the Legisla-
tive Council was
illegal. Later the
High Court reversed
the verdict of the
State Court, decid-
ing that the course
taken by the Gov-
ernment was legal.
The appeal to the
electors took place
simultaneously with
the Federal Elec-
tion for the return
of three Senators
and ten members to
the Plouse of Rep-
resentatives. The
referendum proved
that the electors
were against the
abolition of the
Upper House, the
votingbeing 179,105
against and 116,196
for the abolition
of the Chamber. An event noteworthy in a sphere
far other that politics took place in June, when
the bi-centenary of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons,
E.C., was celebrated at the Exhibition, Brisbane. The
address on the occasion was given by the Rev. W.
Scott, of Toowong.
The session of Parliament did not terminate with
the passing of the year, for members reassembled on
January 30, and a number of measures were dealt with
in the ensuing fortnight during which Parliament was
at work. Among the Bills approved and made law were
the following: Factories and Shops Acts Further
Amendment Bill; Mount Molloy Railway Bill;
Clermont Food Relief Bill; Health Acts Amendment
Bill; Discharged Soldiers Settlement Bill. The follow-
ing measures were declared by the Assembly to have
been lost in the meaning of the Parliamentary Bills
Referendum Act:—lncome Tax Act Amendment Bill;
Meatworks Bill; Regulation of Sugar Cane Prices Act
Amendment Bill; Rabbit Bill; Wages Bill. The Upper
House did not pass the following measures; —The
Chillagoe and Etheridge Railway Bill; the Valuation of
Land Bill; and the Hospitals Bill.
The next session of Parliament opened on June
9 and within a week the forces of the Opposition had
made a strong effort at consolidation, the Liberal
Association and the
National Federa-
tion having united
on the 15th of the
month. Following a
time-honoured pre-
cedent in Parlia-
ment the Ministry
during the month
of October sought
to strengthen their
fighting line in the
-Upper House, and
did so by the addi-
tion of the follow-
ing thirteen gentle-
men : —The Hons.

tice, E. B. Pur-
nell, T. Nevitt,
and Randolph Bed-
ford .
On August 29 the Leader of the Opposition moved
a want of confidence motion dealing with the attitude
of the Government in regard to the Northern railway
strike. An amendment, however, by the Premier was
carried by 39 votes to 22. In the following month
came the Treasurer’s Budget Speech, which foreshad-
owed a deficit of £496,612. To liquidate the debit
balance it was proposed to introduce additional taxation
by a new income tax, additional stamp and succession
duties, super-land tax of 2d. in the pound on all
taxable land of an unimproved value of £2,500 and
upwards, together with extra rents from pastoral hold-
ings, obtainable by removing the limitation on the

powers at the Land Court in regard to increasing the
rents of pastoral Crown tenancies after reassessment.
The proposed scheme of taxation would, it was estimated,
yield £500,000, substituting a surplus of £3,388 for the
deficit. Again did the Legislative Council decline to
accept a Bill deemed of great importance to the Ministry.
The measure was the Requisition of Ships Bill, and had
for its object the relieving of the tension due to the
shipping strike. Yet further friction between the two
chambers was due to the Upper House taking exception
to an Appropriation Bill for £900,000, and succeeding
after a free conference between the two Houses in
securing the reduction of the sum asked for by one-half.
A number of measures including the Income Tax
Amendment Bill were turned down by the Upper House,
while one, the State Iron and Steel Works Bill, was so
amended as to be inaoceptable to the Legislative Assem-
bly, and so went to its appointed place among the lost
Bills under the Parliamentary Bills Referendum Act.
Parliament ceased work on December 6.
That which held the attention of all during 1918
was the war. Nothing in the political world, and nothing
in development in any sphere was of moment unless it
could be seen that it had relation to the struggle which
had gone on for more than three years. Of great
importance was it therefore when the tidings came that
the grand company of workers in a good cause, the
Young Men’s Christian Association, in its Queensland
branch had raised £35,000, the quota to be obtained by
members of the Association in the State. Yet another
great band of noble workers, the Red Cross Society,
aimed high in seeking to collect £IOO,OOO in aid of their
splendid services to the men on war service who were
missing, wounded, or in captivity. None knew better than
the friends of members of the A.I.F. how thoroughly
the Red Cross people did their work. The Queensland
branch attained its ambition. April 25 witnessed the
enthusiastic celebration of Anzac Day, nor was Empire
Day less fittingly celebrated, a very appropriate touch
of sympathy and recognition being found in the dinner
given to veterans of the Crimean war. In June the
Friendly Societies in the metropolitan area raised
£2,000 for the Patriotic Fund through the holding of
sports. It may be mentioned that a month later it was
announced that the total amount subscribed to the fund
was £584,735. The coming of August gave occasion for
an enthusiastically patriotic gathering on the fourth
anniversary of the war, the meeting being held in Maiket
Square, Brisbane, "While the evidence of overmastering
patriotism was very great, and could be gathered from
every district and township in the State, it cannot be
denied that as the dark days of the war lengthened there
was a tendency among certain sections to seek the ending
of the struggle no matter what the cost of peace might be.
Nothing could show this more clearly than the affirmation
by an industrial council “that the sole interest of
workers of all countries lay in the stopping of the war.”
Perchance it was the darkest hour before the dawn, for
the overture of peace came, but a day after the French
Mission had brought their visit to Queensland to a
close, and on October 1 Bulgaria, always a doubtful
factor in the scheme of aggression, concluded anjarmistice.
Hostilities with Turkey ceased on the last day of October
by the Sultan’s unconditional surrender, and three days
later Austria-Hungary obtained an armistice on terms
dictated by the Allies. On November 11 Germany
accepted the terms of the Allies in regard to an armis-
tice. Great rejoicings took place in Queensland as well
as in other parts of the Empire and all the Allied
countries.
The first months of the year 1918 brought serious
and disastrous floods, attended with sad loss of life. The
town of Mackay and the surrounding district was
swejit by a cyclone, followed by torrential rains, result-
ing in floods, through which twenty persons lost their
lives and great damage to ensued, among the
losses being a large consignment of sugar stacked on the
wharves at the Pioneer River, ready for shipment. Three
vessels were also sunk, and the damage sustained in
Mackay and district was estimated at £1,500,000. In
Rockhampton floods played havoc, stock being lost, and.
far more regrettable, several persons drowned. Later,
in March, a cyclone wrecked Babinda, north of Towns-
ville, the State hotel being greatly damaged. Here, too,
there was loss of lives and many casualties. At another
important sugar district in the north, Innisfail, the
losses were still greater, for there were more than one
bundled casualties and nearly every house in the town
was wrecked. Similar losses were reported from Ingham,
while Cardwell, Atherton, and Mount Garnet were more
or less damaged.
Among the events significant of industrial well-
being and progress was the contract given by the Com-
monwealth Government to AValkers, Limited, of Mary-
borough, for the building of four steel ships, and in the
middle of the year a section of the Dayboro railway,
from Sunford to Mitcheltou, was opened by the Acting
Chief Secretary, Mr. J. M. Hunter. Later in the
year, in November, the Government purchased Lynd-
hurst Station in North Quensland, the property being
stocked with 25,000 cattle and 415 horses. The pur-
chasing price was £170,000.
Serious bush fires swept the western and south-
western districts during the year, and the losses due to
this source at Saltern Creek Station were not confined
to stock, for the manager (Mr. A. K. Jones) and four


others were burnt to death. Yet other havoc, due to
the fire fiend, though not working through bush fires,
occurred in the course of the year, for in September the
premises of Walter Reid & Co., a building of three
stories, in Quay and Derby Streets, Rockhampton, was
destroyed, the damages being calculated at £BO,OOO.
Education must always represent the stamp on pro-
gress, and without it there can be no sterling advance-
ment. For that reason it is most satisfactory to record
the opening of the new Anglican Grammar Schoolhouse,
the ceremony being performed by His Excellency the
Governor, and attracting a large number of interested
spectators. The function took place on June 10 and
of the Cabinet, Mr. Hunter assuming the duties of Vice-
President of Executive Council, being succeeded at the
Lands Office by Mr. Coyne, who in turn was succeeded
at the Department of Railways by Mr. Fihelly, Mr. W.
N. Gillies, Honorary Minister, acting as Minister for
Justice. The Ministry as a whole, as it came back to
power after the election and subsequent to the changes
referred to, was as follows:—Chief Secretary and
Attorney-General, Mr. T. J. Ryan; Treasurer and
Secretary for Public Works, Mr. E. G. Theodore;
Home Secretary, Mr. J. Huxham; Secretary for
Agriculture and Stock, Mr. W. Lennon; Secretary
for Public Lands, Mr. J. H. Coyne; Secretary for
RAILWAY BRIDGE, INDOOROOPILLY.
had an important bearing on the future of the State,
far outside merely denominational interests.
Turning to the sphere of politics one finds the focus
of many ambitions in the general election which took
place on March 16; Parliament having been dissolved
on the 16th of the preceding month. The electors,
speaking through the ballot boxes, expressed their will
with no uncertain voice, for when the numbers were
hoisted it was found that 48 Labourites had been le-
turned to Parliament, and 24 Nationalists. In the month
of May there was a change in the leadership of the
Liberal Party, Mr. E. H. Macartney succeeding Mr.
Tolmie. Prior to that there had been a re-arrangement
Railways, Mr. ,T. A. Pihelly; Secretary for Public
Instruction, Mr. H. F. Hardacre; Vioe-Pi'esident of
the Executive Council, Mr. J. M. Hunter; Honorary
Minister and Acting Minister for Justice, Mr. W. N.
Gillies; Secretary for Mines (with seat in the Legisla-
tive Council), Mr. A. J. Jones.
Much of the attraction the opening day of Parlia-
ment presents to society was lacking when the Legis-
lature met, and there was no guard of honour for His
Excellency. The great work of the session was the picking
up of the fragments, in other words the re-introduction
of measures previously obnoxious to the Legislative
Council. In all thirty-one Bills were again dealt with.


CHAPTER XXXVIII.
A LEAN YEAR.
The years of a community are like the days of an in-
dividual. Some are altogether bright; others are dark
and clouded. Of the latter description was in some sense
1919, for during the course of all the seasons the rigors
of drought conditions were experienced. The prices of
the necessaries of life rose abnormally, fruit and vege-
tables were difficult to procure, and such as were mar-
keted, of inferior quality. The year was a lean one and
the gloom of things was intensified by the presence of the
influenza epidemic.
In the political sphere by-elections resulted in the
return of the Government candidates, Messrs. Bulcock
and Foley for the constituencies of Barcoo and Leich-
hardt, respectively, while in regard to the contest be-
tween Messrs. Macdougall and Spence, the latter, who
represented Opposition interests, topped the poll. The
election of Barcoo was due to the Chief Secretary and
Attorney-General, Mr. T. ,T. Ryan, resigning his seat
in order to enter the field of Federal politics. Mr. E,
G. Theodore succeeded Mr. Ryan in the leadership of
the Government.
What may be termed the wider politics occupied in
the main the field of interest, for industrial troubles
assumed in Brisbane threatenings of a revolutionary
violence, and it seemed as though the hard times, experi-
enced in Europe as the aftermath of the Great War,
were extending their influence to Australia. And yet the
times had their compensations, for there was the home-
coming of the Australian soldiers, other than those in
the Palestine adventure who returned some time later,
following that event of world importance, the ratifica-
tion of the Peace Treaty at Paris. Through Mr.
Hughes, who represented Australia on the historic
occasion, the Commonwealth played a part in shaping
the destinies of the Nations. In the southern portions
of the Island Continent, the waves of unrest, however,
seemed to beat more heavily than they did in Queens-
land. The seamen’s strike could not but largely affect
a State with a huge coastal line, such as Queensland
possesses, and even the turmoil of Broken Hill reverber-
ated throughout the vast area which she comprises. In
Northern Queensland, the meat-workers on the one hand
and the railway employes on the other, seemed to chal-
lenge the control of the Government itself, as well as the
industrial interests with which their work links them.
The year saw an extraordinary advance in long dis-
tance aviation —the crossing of the Atlantic and the yet
more ambitious undertaking of a flight from England to
Australia which was successfully accomplished by
Captain Ross Smith and Lieutenant Keith Smith, who
were subsequently knighted for their great achievement.
Turning to a very important indicator of the pros-
perity and well-being of the State, we find that during
the year 1918-19, the exports, oversea, represented
£12,447,416 compared with £15,453,157 in the corres-
ponding previous period. The imports for the year were
£6,075,674 as compared with £4,492,746 in 1917-18.
Of the exports the most important were: —Wool (greasy
and scoured), £6,765,217; meat (all kinds), £3,371,907;
hides and skins, £264,564; tallow, £640,612; butter,
cheese and milk, £693,449. The shipping returns show
689 vessels of a tonnage of 1,157,646 as having entered
at all ports, while 681 cleared, the total tonnage being
1,139,661. In the preceding year 676 vessels of a total
tonnage of 1,157,642 entered and 679 cleared, the ton-
nage being 1,196,528.
Queensland’s coal production in 1919 was 931,631
tons, the total value being £614,307, representing a
slight decrease as compared with the previous year. The
chief sources of the supply are the coalfields in the West
Moreton, Wide Bay and Clermont districts. In regard
to tin-mining, the centre of interest has moved from
Stanthorpe in the south to Tinaroo and the Walsh in
the North. In 1919 the total output was 994 tons of a
value of £143,167. The value of copper mined was
£952,501, the amount being 9,997 tons. Here, also,
there was a decrease on the returns of the previous year,
when 18,980 tons were mined, the value being
£2,087,751. In the year under review, the silver mined
totalled 92,048 oz., the value being £28,772, showing a
slight decrease on the previous figures. Wolfram also
showed a diminution in production, the output being 229
tons valued at £40,596 as against 249 tons of a value of
£43,041. In gems there was a satisfactory increase, the
value of the year’s output being £42,883, as against
£16,591 in the preceding year.
The returns of gold won in the State during the
year represented a total of 117,476 oz. of the value of
£514,105. The three fields in the lead were Rockhamp-
ton and Mount Morgan in the Central Division with
89,963 oz.; Gympic (Southern Division) 14,539 oz.; and
Charters Towers and Cape River (Northern Division)
with 8,095 oz.
Turning to the pastoral industry we find the statis-
tics show a cheering change from the records of the pre-
vious year, and demonstrate the marvellous recuperative
power of the grazing industry in Queensland. The area
of land devoted to pastoral pursuits—including occupa-
tion licences —was 352,740,840 acres, figures comparing


favourably with 352,110,030 acres of the preceding year.
Ihere were in all at the close of the year, 1,957 runs,
the total area being 211,030,440 acres. The cattle
showed an increase on the previous year of 153,689, the
number being 5,940,433. In sheep there was a decrease
of 841,653, the number in the State totalling 17,379,332.
The number of horses showed a decrease of 23,021 as
compared with the previous year, the figures for 1919
being 731,705. The number of pigs was 99,593, a
decrease of no less than 41,373.
In agriculture sugar holds first place. There were
in all 34 sugar and juice mills, the yield of sugar being
dairying industry may be gauged by the fact that in the
year 1919 there were 18,952 establishments deaiing
with cream or butter and in addition 42 butter and 85
cheese factories, the combined States and private factories
turning out in all 26,213,514 lb. of butter and
8,296,218 lb. of cheese.
The fruit-growing industry in Queensland was of
great importance in the year under attention and gave
scope to large vineyards where in all 48,495 gallons of
wine were made, the return of grapes being in all
2,194,320 lb. Other fruit products were pineapples,
676,483 dozen; oranges, 185,806 bushels; apples,
PALM AVENUE, ROCKHAMPTON GARDENS.
162,134 tons from 1,258,760 tons of cane. In addition
there were four distilleries at work producing 488,080
gallons of rum. In crops other than sugar the returns
of the principal products were as detailed hereunder;
Maize, 1,830,664 bushels, being an average yield per
acre of 17‘39 bushels; wheat (chiefly produced on the
Darling Downs and in the Central Division), 311,638
bushels, the average yield being 6’71 bushels. In addi-
tion there were largely grown lucern, grass and oats,
potatoes and barley, while tobacco and arrowroot were
very successfully cultivated. The importance of the
68,477 bushels; mangoes, 53,375 bushels; strawberries,
44,884 quarts.
The educational facilities of the State included
1,425 State Schools, 134 provisional schools and four
reformatory and aboriginal schools. In all there were
ten grammar schools, including four for girls, and a large
number of secondary schools for boys and girls. In
addition there were ten institutions in various parts of
the State for neglected children. The average daily
attendance was 93,569 and the expenditure on primary
education during the year amounted to £712,611.


CHAPTER XXXIX.
THE VISIT OF THE PRINCE.
The drought which had paralysed progress came to
an end early in 1920, the outlook became more hopeful
and the prospects of a return of prosperous times
cheered the State.
The most notable event of the year was the visit of
His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, who made a
royal progress through the Commonwealth. His ease ol
manner and lovable personality strengthened the ties
which bind Australia to the Motherland, and his tour
demonstrated more clearly than ever before the unity of
Empire. The visit to Queensland was all too short, but
will ever be one of the most valued features in the re-
trospect of the State.
Early in the second quarter of the year came the
tidings of the death of Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams, who
had endeared himself to all during his term of office as
Governor of the State. The sad event took place at
South Africa while his Excellency was en route to Eng-
land.
In the political sphere the activities 'were impor-
tant and far-reaching, the Labour Party again being
asked by the majority of the electors to administrate
the affairs of the State. The appeal to the people took
place on October 9. The changes which occurred in the
Ministry were all within the party and the re-arrange-
ment was as follows : —Premier and Chief Secretary, Mr.
E. G. Theodore; Attorney-General, Mr. John Mullan;
Home Secretary, Mr. W, McCormack; Secretary tor
Railways, Mr. J. Larcombe; Secretary for Public In-
struction, Mr. J. Huxham; Treasurer and Secretary for
Public Works, Mr. J. A. Fihelly; Secretary for Agri-
culture and Stock, Mr. W. N. Gillies; Secretary for
Public Lands, Mr. J. H. Coyne ; Minister without port-
folio, Mr. Forgan Smith; Secretary for Mines (with seat
in Legislative Council) Mr. A. J. Jones. The foregoing
result of the shuffle of the Ministerial cards inferred
changes in the inner relations and constitution of the
Cabinet. Prior to the election the duties pertaining to
the Lands Department had been vested in the Chief
Secretary, Mr. Theodore, who was also Minister for
Lands. After the verdict at the polls, Mr. J. 11. Coyne,
who had been Minister without portfolio and Assistant
Minister for Lands, took full charge of that department.
The Cabinet was enlarged by the addition of another
Minister and the representative of Mackay, Mr. Forgan
Smith, was placed in charge of the Works Department.
To Mr. M. J. Kirwan, Member for Brisbane, were
relegated the duties of Chairman of Committees.
Later in the same month there was held a referen-
dum vote on the question of prohibition. The verdict
of the people was quite emphatic, the vote being 175,225
for continuance of the system in use as against 28,222
for State Control and 145,222 for prohibition.
During the year Mr. Urquhart, who had performed
excellent service as Commissioner of Police, went to the
Northern Territory as Administrator, while Mr. Watson
became Commissioner of State Insurance, succeeding
Mr. J. Goodwyn.
An event of great importance was tbe merging of
the State Savings Bank in the Commonwealth Bank.
One of the most untoward events of the year was the
maritime strike which threw out of gear the industrial
machinery of the Commonwealth and had a disastrous
influence on the public, private and national life of
Australia.
During the year, Sir Samuel Griffith, whose name
had been long linked with the State at the Bench, the
Bar and the Legislature, and who later served the Com-
monwealth with distinction in the higher calling of
Federal politics, passed away, full of years and honours.
In the course of the year the allowance of Federal mem-
bers of Parliament was increased from £6OO to £I,OOO
per annum. The first Peace Loan had been issued in
1919, amounting to £25,025,000 ; the second was issued
in 1920, £26,613,000 being subscribed.
The year 1921 is not over pleasant in retrospect
to those who follow the progress of Queensland. It is
true that there was a surplus of £9,830 against the
estimate of £11,388, and the Treasurer, Mr. Fihelly, in
his financial statement delivered in September, attri-
buted the severe diminution in the earnings of the Rail-
way Department to the slump in the mining industry
in the Northern and Central divisions and depression in
trade generally, the decrease in the actual revenue as
compared with the estimated earnings being £269,688.
There was an increase on the estimate in regard to taxa-
tion, land revenue, mining and other receipts, the total
increases from these sources being £594,087. There was
a decrease of £5,368 in the amount received from the
Commonwealth under the Surplus Revenue Act. When
it is remembered that the two largest spending depart-
ments were Public Instruction and Railways, it is per-
haps difficult to withhold sympathy from the Govern-
ment, who, for obvious reasons, found it unwise to
retrench overmuch.
In his speech on the occasion referred to, the
Treasurer attributed the balance sheets of the Govern-
ment in their discouraging aspect to the collapse of the
oversea markets for meat, tallow, metals, etc. It is in-
teresting to note the increasing utility of the State
Advances Corporation during the nine months prior to


June 30, 1921, that is since the sub-department was
placed under the direct control of the Treasurer. The
advances to settlers and for workers dwellings totalled
during the period £457,572. If the amount for the
three following months be added, that is up to Septem-
ber 30, it gives an expenditure of £674,784 for the
preceding twelve months, the highest annual expendi-
ture during five years, demonstrating the large extent to
which two admirable systems of helping the people were
availed of. It is perhaps worthy of note that the sum
expended on soldiers’ settlements in 1920-21 was
£1,017,000 and there was a sum of £750,000 placed on
the estimates for the following year.
Speaking in September of the year in question, the
accomplished, the other, the Hon. T. J. Ryan, who had
sought the larger sphere of Federal politics, succumbed
to sudden illness and passed away in the noonday of his
powers.
The pooling of interests industrial had come into
vogue during the war, when wheat pools, dairy produce
pools and others were formed enabling the producers to
control the local and interstate markets. In the initia-
tive the system had been voluntary, but in 1920, one
phase of pooling was rendered compulsory by the Wheat
Pool Act, which provided for the management of the
system by the farmers themselves. The benefits of pool-
ing in regard to the crop affected have been marked and
proved beyond question the satisfactory results accruing
STRIPPING WHEAT AT ROMA.
Treasurer made the cheering affirmation that the depres-
sing circumstances through which the State was strug-
gling were not due to internal factors, for Mr. Fihelly
stated “that a general view of the present situation
makes it quite clear that if outside markets were at all
normal, this year would probably be the most prosper-
ous in the history of the State .... the seasons have
been most bounteous, crops everywhere are flourishing
and our primary industries, with the exception of min-
ing, are thriving. ”
During the year two men who wrote their names
large in the history of the State passed away. Of these,
one was the representative of Maranoa in the Common-
wealth Parliament, the Hon. J. Page, who had enjoyed
the suffrages of the electors since Federation was
from co-operation between the official advisory board,
the growers and the railway authorities. In the year
under review, the Cheese Pool Act came into operation
as the outcome of a conference of cheese producers. In
regard to the sister industry of butter making, the
system of pooling, though voluntary, was found of great
utility in stabilizing the industry.
The efforts of the Department of Agriculture to en-
hance the value of fruit-growing by giving lessons in
fruit picking were much appreciated and largely availed
of. It is significant that agriculture has not reached
full growth in Queensland, through the fact that dates,
cocoa beans, coffee, tea and spices—unground—figure
among the imports during the year 1920-21 to the total
value of £2,135,108. Some time, it is hoped, the whole


of the articles in question, all of which could be grown
in the State, will find encouragement under a Common-
wealth Bounties Act.
That the advance of sid. per lb. for seed cotton bore
good results may be gauged by a comparison of the statis-
tics of 1919 and 1922 respectively. The acreage had in-
creased from 73 to 7,000 and the yield of the crop from
37,238 to 3,755,526 lb. In the former year the value of
the cotton crop was only £853; in 1922 its value had in-
creased to £86,064 —convincing facts surely for expand-
ing cotton-growing in the State.
In 1921, the maize crop was represented by
2,907,754 bushels as against 2,012,864 in the preceding
year. The average return for the preceding five years
was 21'83 bushels per acre. The Atherton district took
the lead with 445,171 bushels, Wienholt coming second
and Nanango third.
Turning to sugar we find that the year 1921, owing
to an adequate rainfall, was the second largest on record,
the return being 282,198 tons of sugar and the area
under cultivation 184,513 acres, representing the record
as far as area under cane was concerned. It also repre-
sents an increase of 21,894 acres compared with the
land under sugar in 1920. The amount of cane required
to make a ton of sugar had been gradually reduced,
owing to improved methods in cultivation and manufac-
ture, from B’6B in 1918 to B‘ll in 1921. The number of
growers in the year under review was 4,465 as compared
with 3,930 in 1920, and the value of the total output of
sugar, £8,560,006 as against £5,077,830 for 1920.
CHAPTER XL.
THE ABOLITION OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.
During the year 1922 there was a satisfactory in-
crease in the number of stock in the State, the number
of cattle in that year being 7,047,370, and representing
an increase of 591,703. The total number of sheep was
18,402,399, an increase of 997,559 compared with 1921
and the sheep industry was in a very satisfactory posi-
tion on account of the splendid price of wool. The in-
crease in the number of horses in 1922 totalled 5,326,
the total number being 747,543, whilst pigs had increased
by 40,713. During the year ended June 30, 1922, the
average price of stock sold at the Newmarket saleyards
in Brisbane was as follows: —cattle, £5 145.; calves,
£3 7s. 6d.; sheep, 12s. 6d.; lambs, 10s.
In the mining fields of the country as a whole the
results of working in 1922 were satisfactory, the value of
all minerals being £1,791,333, showing an increase of
£334,897. Copper, which had risen slightly during the
earlier part of the year fell at the end of 1922 to £64
per ton, a price which forbade production as the cost
of obtaining the metal in Queensland exceeded that
amount. The improvement in the tin market from £l6B
to £lB2 per ton naturally provided an impetus beneficial
to the industry. In regard to gold production the re-
turn represented an increase of 40,208 fine oz. valued at
£170,793, being one-half of the total output. It is
noteworthy that the North Phoenix, of Gympie, a mine
that has been worked for more than forty years, should
in 1922 have given the largest yield in its history. The
output of coal represented 958,519 tons valued at
£840,472, compared with 954,763 tons of a value of
£831,483. The average cost of production throughout
the whole of Queensland during the twelve months was
17s. 6d. There was a serious reduction in' the output of
coke in the Ipswich district compared with the preceding
year and a yet more serious slump as against production
in 1920. which was more than double. At Mount Mulli-
gan a coke plant was started and good results are antici-
pated. The output of gems represented a decrease on
the previous year to the extent of almost one-third.
The total value of opal won was £5OO.
The latest statistics show what a valuable asset the
dairying industry represents to the State. In all
61.000. lb. of butter were made and more than
15.000. lb, of cheese, together with an equal
amount of condensed milk. The increase on the output
of the previous year was 20,000,000 lb. of butter,
4.000. lb. of cheese and 2,000,000 lb. of condensed
milk, the total value of the products being £2,964,204.
Employment was given to 35,684 persons and the value
of the machinery employed in the industry represented
£672,088. Nothing perhaps could give a more convinc-
ing argument concerning the importance of dairying
than the foregoing figures.
In 1922 there took place a very important and far-
reaching alteration in the State Legislature through the
abolition of the Legislative Council—the result of a
statute passed by the Government towards the close of
the preceding year. Among other changes due to legis-
lation was an amendment of the Constitution by which
an age limit for the retirement of judges of the Supreme
Court was provided. Under that statute, the Chief
Justice, Sir Pope Cooper, and Justices Real and Chubb,
and later on, Mr. Justice Jameson, resigned duties all
had performed so well and positions all had adorned.

It is noteworthy that in regard to the last-named mem-
ber of the judiciary that retirement came perforce after
he had seen but eight months’ service on the Bench.
During the year electioneering interests were touched
by the Voting by Proxy Act.
A well-devised and important event was the visit to
the State of the Cotton Delegation, a party of gentlemen
travelling in Imperial interests who during an extended
tour throughout Queensland were emphatic in their ex-
pression of opinion that Queensland was admirably
suited for the production of Sea Island cotton. Thus
does the crop, which found favour before sugar-growing
ousted it, promise to become a very powerful rival to
sugar, possessing as it does the advantages of being moie
suitable to the small farmer, necessitating far less capi-
tal and labour than sugar-cane. The latest figures are
interesting and show that to July 24 the following seed-
cotton was received:—Rockhampton Ginnery, 3,273,096
lb., value £71,601 15s. 2d.; Wowan, 1,757,941 lb.,
£40,275 7s. Bd.; Whinstanes, 3,908,948 lb., £88,833
19s. 6d.; Gayndah, 711,816 lb., £16,311 9s. Bd.;
Dalby, 402,161, £9,215 12s. Id. Total 10,053,962 lb.,
value £226,238 4s. Id.—figures that speak for them-
selves when it is stated that the season has been the
driest experienced for the past twenty-five years over
the areas planted.
A notable event of the year was the total eclipse of
the sun which took place on September 21, and from the
fact that this State, in its southern bounds, offered ex-
ceptional facilities for observation, quite a number of
scientists visited Queensland. The obituary of the year
includes amongst those whom the State worthily hon-
oured in its service, Sir Robert Philp, Sir Robert Scott,
Mr. J. Baynes and Mr. K. M. Grant.
In the year 1921-22, the value of exports showed an
increase of more than £2,000,000 compared with the
previous year, but in imports there was a decrease of
more than £3,000,000. In examining the details we
find that in the following productions exported there
were substantial increases compared with the trade of
the foregoing annual period:—Ores; hides and skins;
meat, all kinds; tallow 7 ; wool (greasy and scoured);
whilst butter, cheese and milk show a considerable
decrease. Cotton re-appears as an export with a total
of 64,182 lbs.
Favourable seasons and work in development make
a comparison between Queensland, or indeed any of the
Australian States, and countries in Europe, very
favourable to the former, at the dawning of 1923.
Matters, social, cultural, industrial and political pur-
sued the even tenor of their ways until May approached,
when the bustle and turmoil of a State election came
into evidence. It may be that strong partizans of the
Opposition entertained hopes that there would be a
change of front in the political line, but if this were so
then disappointment awaited those who held them. The
Government, prior to the election, comprised the
following gentlemen: —Premier, Chief Secretary and
Treasurer, Mr. E. G. Theodore; Attorney-General, Mr.
J. Mullan; Home Secretary, Mr. W. McCormack;
Secretary for Railways, Mr. J. Larcombe; Secretary for
Public Instruction, Mr. J. Huxham; Secretary for
Public Works, Mr. W. Forgan Smith; Secretary for
Agriculture and Stock, Mr. W. N. Gillies; Secretary for
Public Lands, Mr. J. H, Coyne; Minister without port-
folio, Mr. J. Stopford; Secretary for Mines, Mr. A. J.
Jones. Mr. G. W. Watson acted as Clerk to the Exe-
cutive Council.
As a result of the voting on the eventful day, May
12, the Labour or Ministerial Party were returned wdth
a majority of 16, proving that the Labour Administra-
tion in the State had the confidence of the majority.
The only change in the Cabinet, was occasioned through
Mr. Coyne resigning to take a seat on the Land Court
Bench, his successor as Minister for Lands being Mr. F.
T. Brennan.
It is of interest to record that at an extraordinary
election held on -Inly 7 in the Kingaroy Shire, rendered
necessary through the recent alterations in the boundaries
of the Shire, a lady representative was returned. There-
fore to Mrs. Rent-Wilson is the honour of being the first
woman in Queensland elected to such a public position.
Notwithstanding the period of drought and conse-
quent effect on the growth of the wool, the pastoralists
of the State have every reason to be satisfied with the
returns for the wool season 1922-23. The latest avail-
able figures give the number of sheep at the beginning
of the year as 17,051,756, a decrease of approximately
1,250,000 from the previous period, so naturally the
clip was smaller, but throughout the whole of the sales
there was strong competition, a keen demand and most
satisfactory prices. In the eight sales of the 1922-23
series 298,621 bales were offered and 298,578 sold.
Of the future of Queensland we speak confidently,
for where there has been steady ascent for so many vears
an arresting, or even a halting, is not to be thought of.
Wise recognition by the people of their powers and the
sufficiency of them, with a firm conviction that in con-
stitutional reform lies a remedy for every ill the body
politic is heir to, afford at once the security and the
means for sure advancement.


Explorers and Explorations.
(Continued from Vol. II., page 148)
CHAPTER IX.
DR. LUDWIG LEICHHARDT.
Of all Australian explorers who have fought
privation, risked dangers unknown, and perished in
the interior wilds of the then little-known Continent,
the name of none has attracted the same degree of
romance and curiosity as has that of Dr. Ludwig
Leichhardt. Disastrous as was the fate of the party
led into the heart of the Continent by Burke and Wills,
yet the sad ending of the victims of that ill-led expedi-
tion was at least ascertained and even the bodies of the
leaders recovered. The whole history of the causes
leading to the failure was made known. But of the
end of Leichhardt and his comrades on his final enter-
prise all is shrouded in mystery. Critics have assumed
that the whole party were murdered by blacks. Others
have believed that, penetrating too far into the interior
desert when conditions were fairly favourable, it was
impossible for the explorers to retrace their steps to
more suitable regions when a period of rainlessness
and dearth of vegetation overtook the arid heart of the
Continent. The view of still others has been that
Leichhardt was the victim of just such a flood as
washed away the township of Clermont early in 1917,
drowning fifty-three persons. No final traces of the
death of the explorers have ever been discovered. But
it may be taken for certain that the end was reached
in Queensland. Before meeting the doom of which we
know so little. Dr. Leichhardt had conducted other
expeditions, all of which concerned the north-eastern
part of the Continent.
Before beginning his career as an explorer, Dr.
Leichhardt had devoted his efforts to botany. Know-
ledge of that science, of course, gave greater value to
his journeyings over new land. His medical training
also endowed him with special advantages, for making
it his practice to associate with the natives he was able
to cure many of their ailments, and consequently came
to be favoured by tribes among which it would not
have been safe for ordinary white men to penetrate.
Dr. Leichhardt was born in Germany, educated in
Paris, and had resided for a long while among British
people. Por two years, extending from 1842 to 1844,
he had been exploring to the north of Moreton Bay.
In 1844 the people of New South Wales decided to
send an exploring expedition to the westward and
northward. Oxley, Mitchell, Cunningham, and Sturt
had ail done work in those directions, but it was desired
to greatly extend existing knowledge of that portion
of Australia. A large amount of exploring work had been
carried out recently on the western side of the Continent,
and undoubtedly this stimulated the desire of the people
of New South Wales to learn more of the very much
richer territory which they possessed. The particular
proposal at that time was to send an expedition overland
from Moreton Bay to Port Essington, on the northern
coast. Sir Thomas Mitchell already had established his
reputation as an explorer on so sure a foundation that
it was to him that all eyes were turned as tne
most suitable leader of the enterprise. A considerable
delay occurred in obtaining the needed funds and sanc-
tion from the Colonial and Imperial Governments.
While the public was waiting for an end to be reached
in the long road of official circumlocution news came of
South Australia’s plans to send out a party for Port
Essington under the command of Captain Sturt. In
those days a great deal of rivalry existed among the
Colonies in the matter of exploring what might well be
termed “no man’s land.” At that stage Leichhardt
returned from his work to the north of Moreton Bay.
His reputation as an explorer stood high, whilst his
scientific attainments were beyond question. At once
he set to work to start an expedition by public subscrip-
tion. This would not require the assistance of any
Government. The plan was not carried out without
considerable difficulty. Leichhardt himself wrote:
“I had well considered this interesting subject in all its
bearings, and had discussed it with many of my
acquaintances at Brisbane and its neighbouring district,
who were generally of opinion that it was practicable
under the plan I had marked out; but with others,
particularly at Sydney, 1 had to contend against a
strong but kindly-meant opposition to my journey.
Some who took more than a common interest in my
pursuits regretted I should leave so prominent a field
of research as that which offered itself within the limits
of New South Wales, and in which they considered 1
had laboured with some success during the last two
years. Others considered the undertaking exceedingly
dangerous, and even the conception of it madness on
my part, and the consequence of a blind enthusiasm,
nourished either by a deep devotion to science or by


an unreasonable craving for fame; whilst others did not
feel themselves justified in assisting a man who they
considered was setting out with an intention of com-
mitting suicide. I was not, however, blind as to the
difficulties of the journey which I was determined to
undertake; on the contrary—and I hope my readers will
believe me to be sincere—l thought they would be many
and great —greater indeed, than they proved to bo;
but during my recent excursions through the squatting
districts I had so accustomed myself to a comparatively
wild life, and had so closely observed the habits of the
aborigines, that I felt assured that the only real diffi-
culties that I could meet with would be of a local
character.”
The above words appear in the introduction to
Leichhardt’s account of the expedition—the last from
which he ever returned. The funds for the expedition
were subscribed, and Leichhardt duly appointed to take
command. Unfortunately, the funds were too slender
to allow of an adequate supply of scientific instruments
being taken, and the leader decided to limit his party
to six persons besides himself. The instruments carried
consisted of a sextant, an artificial horizon, a chrono-
meter, a hand Rater’s compass, a small thermometer,
and an Arrowsmith’s map of the continent of “New
Holland.” No provision was made for any of these
things being replaced if they should be lost or broken
on the way. But clearly Leichhardt was managing the
expedition with the view to lightness of equipment and
speed of transit as primary considerations. “As our
movements,” he wrote, “were to be comparatively in
light marching order our preparations were confined
more to such provisions and stores as were actually
necessary than to anything else. But I had frequently
reason to regret that I was not better furnished with
instruments, particularly barometers, or a boiling water
apparatus, to ascertain the elevation of the country and
ranges we had to travel over.”
A great many persons offered to accompany Leich-
hardt on his perilous enterprise, but most of these offers
had of necessity to be rejected. The companions ulti-
mately selected by the explorer consisted of Mr. James
Calvert, Mr. John Roper, John Murphy (a lad of about
sixteen years of age), William Phillips (a prisoner of the
Crown), and an aboriginal named Harry Brown. Tine
total number of the party thus consisted of half a
dozen persons, making a striking contrast to the
cumbersome cavalcade which set out from Melbourne on
the ill-starred expedition led by poor Burke and Wills.
Sydney was left on the night of August 13 for
Moreton Bay by a steamer known as the “Sovereign.”
Thirteen horses were carried for the party. The lengthy
period of a week was occupied on the voyage, the usual
time in those days for the passage being three days.
This had the effect of greatly deteriorating the condition
of the horses, for besides the knocking about they
received from rough weather, food and water lor them
had been provided for only the ordinary period at sea.
On arrival at Brisbane Leichhardt received the warmest
of welcomes and was overloaded with presents, many of
which he was forced either to decline or leave behind
on account of the unwisdom of overloading the expedi-
tion. But one effect of the Brisbane people’s generosity
was to enable the leader to increase his party. The
additions were four. Mr. Pemberton Hodgson, a resident
of the Moreton Bay district; Mr. Gilbert; an Ameri-
can negro, named Caleb; and “Charley,” an
aboriginal. Leichhardt wrote afterwards that he had
made the additions to his party with feelings of con-
siderable reluctance. However, he felt he could not
very well refuse the solicitations of Mr. Hodgson, to
whom he was under considerable obligations for assist-
ance rendered to the expedition. At the Darling Downs a
spring-cart was purchased, but it proved only an impedi-
ment, and later was broken, when Leichhardt was lucky
enough to exchange it for “three good travelling bul-
locks,” which after considerable trouble were broken
to pack-saddle work. Later on a present of four young
steers and one old fat bullock was received from Camp-
bell and Stephens, station-owners who were fallen in
with during the commencement of the journey. The
stock now consisted of sixteen head of cattle and seven-
teep horses. The provisions included 1,200 lb. of flour,
with 200 lb. of sugar, 80 lb. of tea, 20 lb. of gelatine,
and a number of other less bulky commodities. The
ammunition consisted of 30 lb. of powder and eight bags
of shot of various sizes, but mostly of No. 4 and No. 6.
Each member of the party provided himself with two
pairs of strong trousers, three strong shirts, and two
pairs of shoes. A great deal of unnecessary difficulty
appears to have arisen through the riding and pack
saddles not fitting the horses. While there were spare
horses, so that those with sore backs might be rested,
not very much inconvenience was caused, but after-
wards continual trouble arose.
Leichhardt had very little experience with bullocks,
and his companions do not appear to have been able
to help him in the matter. Not only was trouble met
with in breaking the animals to carry packs, but the
explorer had to be guided by what outsiders told him as
to the amount a bullock was able to carry day after day
on a long journey. These statements were very con-
tradictory, but he apjmars to have been advised that
he could put a load of 250 lb. on an animal’s back
during a continuous march. This he found to be
excessive, and subsequently, from his own experience,
he concluded that a bullock could not be made to carry
more than 150 lb. on a long expedition. Altogether
bullocks do not appear to have been a success as carriers.
One of the most difficult portions of the journey
proved to be that lying between Brisbane and the out-
skirts of pastoral settlement. Brisbane was left soon


after a heavy downpour of rain, and this had set all
the creeks running bankers, as well as causing the
ground to be soft and heavy to travel over. A whole
day was occupied in crossing the party and the baggage
over the Brisbane River. Leichhardt was so disaj)-
pointed at this unlooked-for delay that, the night being
moonlight, he determined to push on after sunset. He
had been lent a bullock-dray by Brisbane friends, and
had purchased a light spring-cart. So that with the
aid of these vehicles he made up his mind to
take a fairly long stage before finally camping
for the night. In this he was again disappointed. The
ground was so boggy that the bullocks and horses were
constantly floundering in the mud, and the dray and
cart were axle deep, threaten-
ing continuously to be hope-
lessly embedded in the yielding
ground. However, at about
one o’clock in the morning,
they arrived at Cowper Plains,
some ten miles from Brisbane.
The real start of the expedi-
tion on its journey of explora-
tion dates, of course, from the
point of departure from the
last settlement. This was from
“Jimbour” Station, then
termed, “Jimba,” at that time
belonging to Campbell and
Stephens, near Dalby. The
expedition set out from the
homestead of that holding at
the end of September, 1844,
and it finished the journey in
December of the following year.
During the crossing of the Dar-
ling Downs excellent feed had
been found all the way for the
cattle and horses, whilst the
men had benefited consider-
ably from the cool tern per a-
ture derived from an elevation of 2,000 feet above sea-
level. For the first few weeks they travelled through
country which certainly had been quite recently soaked
with rain, and apparently having benefited previously
from a favourable season, Leichhardt described in the
most glowing terms. His journal abounds in botanical
names of known and unknown plants, which do not
strictly belong to a history of exploration, but which
demonstrates the thoroughness with which the scientific
part of the work was carried out. On October 17 the
explorer wrote that the ground had been too heavy
and boggy to permit of the camp being left on the
previous day.
About this time Leichhardt complains of the small
amount of game they are able to obtain, and of the
consequent lack of animal food. Tracks of kangaroos,
of which some were of great size, were seen, but the
animals themselves could not be obtained. The party
had only twice seen emus. Traces of aborigines were
also found, but the tribes appeared to be rare and
scattered. On the 19th a kangaroo was shot, together
with a pigeon and a duck, which gave an appreciated
change of diet. On the same day Gilbert obtained
specimens of coal, which the leader believed to belong to
the same layer as had been discovered at Flagstone Creek,
on Mr. Leslie’s station. He writes:—“We find coal
at the eastern side of the Coast Range, from Illawarra
up to Wide Bay, with sand-
stone, and it seems that it like-
wise extends to the westward of
the Coast Range, being found,
to my knowledge, at Liverpool
Plains, at Darling Downs, and
at Charley’s Creek. It is here,
as well as at the east side, con-
nected with sandstone.” At
that time Mr. Hodgson and
Caleb had to return, because
the party was too large for the
provisions. On November 6 the
main party came upon and
named the Dawson River.
Then they traversed some very
fertile ground, which they
called Calvert Plains, on the
10th again coming upon the
Dawson.
For the next four days they
continued travelling down the
Dawson, the thickets about the
banks of the river making pro-
gress so slow that they were
forced to the neighbouring
ridges. Several fine plains which
were met with Leichhardt called Vervain Plains. About
this region the utmost trouble was experienced with
the bullocks. The beasts kept disturbing hornets’ nests
in trees with their horns in passing. The insects then
would pursue the animals, causing the latter to bolt
and upset their loads. Provisions were constantly being
wasted in this way and the pack-saddles were broken.
Occasionally kangaroos of the largest size were shot,
and these proved to be of the greatest value in render-
ing aid to conserve the supply of food, of which so
much had been lost on account of the frequent trouble
with the bullocks. Soon after leaving the Vervain
Plains they crossed hills, to which they gave the name
DR. LUDWIG LEICHHARDT.


of Gilbert Ranges, after Mr. Gilbert of the party.
Then they crossed and named Palmtre© Creek, and
afterwards Middle Range and Lynd’s Range.
I hey crossed and named Robinson Creek, and,
finding a wide sheet of water alongside that stream,
they bestowed the name of Murphy Lake upon it.
Murphy Range also received its name at the same time.
Orange trees in blossom were found on the Condamine,
and on Robinson Creek again the same species of trees
weie met with, the fruit beginning to set.
The paity, on November 20, were travelling along
Robinson Creek, and entered upon a mountainous
country, the banks of the stream becoming steep and
rugged, whilst frequent narrow gullies running into it
rendered travelling slow and tedious. The party had to
wend their way through narrow valleys and over ranges
where the route was often steep and dangerous. The
latitude of the camp on the 21st was 25 s 28' 12". A
few days later they were travelling over what Leich-
hardt described as stretches of beautiful country, the
leading features being low ridges openly timbered with
the silver-leaved iroubark, whilst the ground was
covered with an abundance of grass and herbs and was
liberally furnished with large lagoons. About the
latter were abundant traces of the visits of aborigines,
who obtained mussels from waterholes. At one of the
recently-vacated black camps the party found four fine
kangaroo nets, made of the bark of Sterculia, two of
which they took, leaving in return a brass-hilted sword,
four fishing hooks, and a silk handkerchief. It was to
this spot that Mr. Hodgson penetrated when he
followed the tracks of the expedition, as the result of
rumours of the party having been lost, the story having
arisen from the very much longer time than that
expected which the journey occupied. A few days later
diarrhoea, from which the party had been suffering
continuously, began to disappear. All kinds of native
meat was readily consumed. “Iguanas, opossoms, and
birds of all kinds,” writes Leichhardt, “had for some
time past been most gladly consigned to our stew pot,
neither good, bad, nor indifferent being rejected. The
dried kangaroo meat, one of our luxuries, differed very
little in flavour from the dried beef, and both, after
long stewing, afforded us an excellent broth, to which
we generally added a little flour. It is remarkable how
soon man becomes indifferent to the niceties of food,
and when all the artificial wants of society have dropped
off the bare necessities of life form the only object of
his desires. One of our bullocks had torn one of the
flour bags and about 15 lb. of flour was scattered over
the ground. We all set to work to scrape up as much
of it as we could, using the dry gum leaves as spoons
to collect it, and when it got too dirty to mix again
with the flour, rather than leave so much behind we
collected about 6 lb. of it, well mixed with dried leaves
and dust, and of this we made a porridge—a mess
which, with the addition of some gelatine, every one
of us enjoyed highly.”
On the 27th of the same month they ascended a
line of hills and travelled for several miles along
the top of this ridge, which was openly timbered. From
this vantage point they could see various other lines of
mountains, “with conspicuous peaks, cupolas, and pre-
cipitous walls of rock,” extending in various directions
from west by north to north-west. To the most distant
range, which was striking and imposing, they gave the
name of Expedition Range, whilst a bell-shaped moun-
tain was called Mount Nicholson, in honour of Doctor
(afterwards Sir) Charles Nicholson, who had first
brought the question of the Port Essington expedition
into the Legislature of New South Wales. Aldis Peak
was called after a Mr. Aldis, of Sydney, who had con-
siderably aided Dr. Leichhardt in launching his enter-
prise. From the range they descended with consider-
able difficulty into a broad valley, bounded on both
sides by slopes and ridges.
On the following day they discovered, in latitude
25 19 19 , a river to which they gave the name of
the Royd. The stream was running in a number of
channels in a south-westerly direction. This day they
busied themselves extracting the oil from an emu which
they had obtained. The operation was performed by
suspending the bird over a gentle fire and permitting
the oil to drip into a vessel. Leichhardt said the oil
was of a light amber colour, and was useful in oiling
the locks of the firearms, also he regarded it as
a good cure for rheumatism, and had used
it occasionally for that purpose. The skins of kangaroo
were used as a covering for the flour bags, which had
become so worn with hard usage as to be unsafe. A day
later, by ascending a range, Leichhardt saw five parallel
ranges striking from north to south. The three easterly
of these he considered sent their waters eastwards and
the two westerly turned their streams in a south-
westerly direction to the Boyd. To the east of the
Boyd was a steep mountain range, striking from east
to west. All the ranges were composed of sandstone
ol horizontal strata. The country passed soon after
reminded Leichhardt of the high gates of ruined castles
in Germany, and he named a creek there the Creek of
the Ruined Castles.
On December 2 the party set out to examine some
open country lying to the north-west, which Gilbert
had seen from the top of a high mountain. They fol-
lowed down a creek, on which the leader bestowed the
name of Zamia Creek, on account of seeing an abores-
cent Zamia, with a stem from eight to ten feet high
and about nine inches in diameter, and with elongated
cones not then ripe. The plant proved to be very pre-
valent in the district. The kangaroos in this region


were very plentiful, and a number of them were shot.
The blacks had been following the animals under cover,
and they displayed their anger at the whit© men inter-
fering with their hunt by spearing one of the horses.
On the 10th of the month the Christmas Range received
its name, the title being chosen because of Leichhardt
expecting to reach the mountains on Christmas Day.
Considerable hardship was experienced about this time.
On© of the good kangaroo dogs was lost, and some of
the party became very nearly bushed, Calvert and
Brown spending a whole night in the scrub. On the
18th one of the pack bullocks was lost in the scrub and
Brown Lagoon, because the native Brown had been the
first to discover them.
By the 28th the party had moved on to Albinia
Range, and on the 30th it had reached Comet Creek
and was close to the foot of Comet Range. On the
following day was discovered the remains of a hut, of
which a ridge pole and two forked stakes remained.
The latter were each about six feet high, and it was
obvious that a European had been at work. The
sticks had been cut with a sharp tomahawk. Leich-
hardt considered that the departed inhabitant of the
place must have been a runaway convict from Moreton
THE ROUTE FOLLOWED BY LEICHHARDT, 1844-5.
had to be abandoned. On the same day they killed the
fat bullock which Mr. Isaacs had given to Leichhardt,
the unconsumci meat being cut into thin slices and
dried under the almost vertical rays of the sun. The
fat was melted down for the purpose of rubbing into the
leather gear to stop it from cracking. Next day Calvert
and Charley were fortunate enough to discover the pack
bullock which previously had been lost. The party re-
mained in the camp they then occupied until alter
Christmas, the feed being good and some fine sheets ol
water being adjacent. The latter Leichhardt called
Bay. Shortly after the discovery of the old hut.
Leichhardt came upon a camp of natives, who instantly
fled at the sight of the white men. “We then rode up
to the camp,” writes Leichhardt, “and found their
dinner ready, consisting of two eggs of the bush turkey,
roasted opossums, bandicoots, and iguanas. In their
‘dillies’ (small baskets) were several roots or tubers of
an oblong form, about an inch in length and half an
inch broad, of a sweet taste and of an agreeable flavour
even when uncooked; there were some balls of pipeclay
to ornament their bodies for corroborees. Good opossum


cloaks, kangaroo nets, and dillies neatly worked of
koorajong bark, were strewed about; there were also
some spears made of the brigalow acacia; all were for-
gotten in the suddenness of their retreat. I could not
resist the temptation of tasting one of their eggs, which
was excellent, but as they seemed to have trusted to
our generosity I left everything in its place and
departed. Brown thought that one of them looked like
a half-caste, and as they called us, as far as we under-
stood, ‘whitefellows,’ I felt confirmed in my supposition
either that a white man was with them or had lived
among them very recently.” Probably Leichhardt’s
surmise was correct regarding the European. Escapes
from the penal establishment at Moreton Bay had been
very common. Indeed, the comparative ease with
which prisoners obtained their liberty formed one of
the reasons why the place was no longer used for puni-
tive purposes. No doubt, in the course of time, one
of the escapees could have penetrated as far as the
Comet, and many refugees were known to have taken
up with the blacks.
The expedition remained camped on the Comet
Creek from December 31 to January 12, 1845.
Vegetable and animal life was plentiful, and water was
abundant. On the edge of the creek Portulce grew, and
was found to be a suitable and palatable substitute for
vegetables for eating. The lagoons swarmed with duck,
whilst the timber was filled with a great variety of birds.
Kangaroos and wallabies were plentiful, as also were
brush turkeys and bronze-winged pigeons. The natives
were very numerous, but no trouble of any kind was
experienced with them. Several exploratory expedi-
tions were made from the camp during this rest, and
on one of these the Mackenzie River was discovered
and named, and was found to receive the waters of the
Comet.
On recommencing his journey, Leichhardt travelled
down the Comet and then along the Mackenzie, where
the natural features made progress easy along the
banks of the stream. The river was not running at
that time, but was formed of a chain of large water-
holes, some of which ranged from fifty to a hundred
yards in width and up to seven or eight miles in length.
Of course, Leichhardt had no means of knowing that the
Mackenzie fell into the Fitzroy, and that consequently
its waters reached the sea at Keppel Bay. At about
this time the party crossed the route which was after-
wards followed by the North Australian Expedition in
1856.
At about tliis time Leichhardt left his companions
in camp, with the exception of Brown, whom he took
with him, and set out to examine the country to the
north. This proved a disagreeable experience to the
pair, as they were lost for four days in a condition of
semi-starvation and nearly sacrificed their lives. First
they discovered some large lagoons in latitude 23 10 ,
then Leichhardt ascended Mount Stewart, which he
named, and afterwards he penetrated further to the
north. The black, Brown, appears to have lost all
courage when he and his leader lost their bearings.
‘‘We are lost; we are lost !” was all he could say. This
was on the 20th. Nothing Leichhardt could say would
put heart into his dusky comrade. However, on the
following day the latter recognized the spot where the
pair had breakfasted a few days previously, and his
gloom immediately disappeared. In the afternoon of
the same day the main camp was reached, the occupants
being in a state of great anxiety about the lengthy
absence of their leader and the black. Leichhardt com-
ments here on the acuteness with which the aborigines
are able to recognize minute natural features and
objects, and which accounts for their usefulness as
trackers. He says; —“I shall have to mention several
instances of the wonderful quickness and accuracy with
which Brown, as well as Charley, were able to recognize
localities which they had previously seen. The impres-
sions on their retina seem to be naturally more intense
than that of the European, and their recollections are
remarkably exact, even to the most minute details.
Trees peculiarly formed or grouped, broken branches,
slight elevations of the ground; in fact, a hundred
things which we should remark only when paying great
attention to a place, seem to form a kind of daguerreo-
type impression on their minds, every part of which is
readily collected.”
West Hill was named on the 25th, on account of it
lying to the westward of their camp, whilst Newman
Creek received its name in honour of Mr. Newman, who
at that time was superintendent of the Botanic Gardens
at Hobart, and who had provided Leichhardt with peach
stones, the last of which was planted at that spot.
The country about here was abundantly provided with
creeks. Extensive plains and numerous hills were dis-
covered in the locality. To four of the latter Leich-
hardt gave the names of Roper Peak, Scott Peak,
Macarthur Peak, and Calvert Peak. He also bestowed
the names of Gilbert Dome and Mount Lowe. To the
party it appeared that the number of isolated conical
mountains was legion. The range was called Peak
Range. At this time Leichhardt was close to the site of
the present town of Clermont. In this locality Gilbert
rode out, leaving his companions in camp, to the west-
ward, and again signs of the presence of a white man
were discovered. Leichhardt says that the wanderer
probably was a shipwrecked sailor or a runaway convict
from Moreton Bay. In view of the number of men
who escaped from Brisbane up to the late thirties, when
most of the prisoners were taken to Sydney, the latter


surmise would appear to be the most likely. The
evidence of the presence of a white man, however, was
not conclusive, and consisted in a mark resembling an
anchor made on a tree with a stone tomahawk. Gilbert
rode to the north-west, and found the country rising in
a succession of terraces, and on ascending these he saw
a line of hills somewhat smaller than the Peak Range.
Leichhardt, taking Charley and Brown with him,
early in February left the main party to reconnoitre to
the northward, and after passing Roper and Scott Peaks
he came upon a creek, which was not running but con-
tained a chain of waterholes. Further to the north the
main party (which the blacks had been sent back to
bring on) passed out of the sandstone country and
entered upon basalt. The grass was abundant, and
they passed and named Phillip Mountain, Fletcher Awl,
Lord s Table Range, and Campbell Peak. A few days
lie recently had been in, for water, she called, “Yarrai,
Yarrai,” and pointed down the river. That water was
to be found down the river afterwards proved to be
correct. At the butt of the tree the white men found
an infant swaddled in layers of teatree bark. Close
beside the little creature were three or four large yams.
Attracted by the screams, a great number of men and
boys came running towards the Europeans, but the
latter put their horses to a canter and made towards
the aborigines who beat a hasty retreat.
At this time the party were hard pushed for water,
and proceeded for some miles down the dry bed of the
stream without finding any. Fortunately, Mr. Gilbert
and Brown, who had ridden in another direction looking
for a spring or hole not yet dry, discovered a lagoon
about half a mile from the junction of the Hughs and
the Isaacs.
PEAK RANGE FROM THE NORTH-WEST, SHOWING ROPER AND SCOTT PEAKS.
later they had to camp without water, but on the
following day they came upon a river, which though
not running at the time promised to be of some import-
ance, and Leichhardt called it the Isaacs, after Mr. F.
Isaacs, of the Darling Downs. Hughs Creek was also
discovered and named, the two streams meeting.
Another stream was named Tombstone Creek, on
account of the shape of masses of sandstone on its banks.
On the following day, near the Isaacs, the party came
upon three native women, two of whom were busily
engaged in digging for yams, whilst the other was on a
tree chopping out wild honey. The trio, immediately
on seeing the white strangers, set up most dreadful
screams, as though to frighten away wild beasts, and
every sign intended to denote friendliness proved fruit-
less. The yam diggers ran away and the woman in the
tree remained among the branches. When Leichhardt
asked her, in the language of the natives of the country
Shortly after this serious trouble was experienced
with the two blacks, Charley and Brown. The affair
arose over the men leaving the camp in the morning
and, by not returning until after the others were ready
to start, keeping the whole party waiting. Upon being
reprimanded Charley used abusive language and struck
Leichhardt such a blow in the face as to loosen two of
his teeth. Charley was then dismissed the camp, and
upon Brown professing his intention of keeping in touch
with his countryman he was told that lie must choose
between loyalty to his friend or loyalty to the camp. As
he decided upon adhering to the former the pair were
driven away from the white men. But afterwards they
both returned separately, begging humbly to be taken
back. After some hesitation Leichhardt acceded to the
supplications. The blacks always afterwards showed an
improved sense of discipline. About this time the heat
proved to be intense, killing a little terrier dog and


rendering the sole remaining kangaroo dog in such a
state of exhaustion that had Mr. Gilbert not carried it
on his horse during the 21st it also would have expired.
On March 1 they found some large waterholes on the
northerly branch of the Isaacs. Here camp was pitched
in what Leichhardt reckoned to be latitude 21° 42' and
longitude 148° 56'.
The party traced the Isaacs up to its source, a
distance of about seventy miles from the late
camp. They then came across the headwaters
of the stream, on which they bestowed the name
of Suttor Creek. A few miles down the latter
good waterholes were found. Leichhardt described the
valley of the Isaacs, in so far as he had seen it, as being
excellent pastoral country. Certainly he had experi-
enced trouble from lack of water, but the season
happened to be dry over the whole of New South Wales.
They had met with a large quantity of wallaby; indeed,
kangaroo formed an article of diet which had enabled
the supply of dried meat to hold out much longer than
otherwise would have been the case. Roper took a ride
to the westward of his companions and found wide
plains of high fertility. The party then continued their
journey along what they took to be the main channel
of the Suttor. The country then being passed through
was well grassed, and the natives were numerous.
The expedition continued along the course of the
river, where they came upon long reaches of water
containing great quantities of vegetation and ducks,
ultimately reaching the junction of the Suttor with
a stream as large as itself. To the latter was given the
name of the Cape River. At this spot Leichhardt
calculated that he was in latitude 20° 49'. Further on
the country improved, and is described as carrying a
great wealth of grass and open timber. The party
camped at the foot of an eminence which was called
Mount McConnel, and a little further on found
the junction of the Suttor with the Burdekin, the bed
of which was a mile wide at the point of meeting.
Game was abundant at this spot, the most numerous
species of birds being pelicans, ducks, and black swans.
The Burdekin received its name because of the liberal
assistance Leichhardt had received for fitting out his
party from Mrs. Burdekin, of Sydney. The party
remained in camp at this spot from March 29 to
April 2, during which time another bullock was killed
and cured.
The journey continued up the Burdekin in a north-
north-west direction. Marks had been observed on the
trees, showing that the river had risen from fifteen to
eighteen feet above its banks. A conspicuous hill to the
east-north-east was named Mount Graham. The Robey
Range was also named. Leichhardt found the country
on the banks of the river so rugged that he had to
cross and recross the stream, on one occasion having to
swim the cattle and horses, so that a good deal of the
stores became wet and considerable time was lost in
drying them. Porter Rang© and Thacker Range were
both named, and in latitude 19° 12' a river as large as
the Burdekin was found to join it from the west and
south-west. This stream was named the Clarke, after
the Rev. W. B. Clarke, of Sydney, who had obtained
fame as a geologist. Bowen Creek was found to be
another tributary of the Burdekin. The party were now
only about thirty miles from Halifax Bay, which was
the nearest that they approached to the east coast.
Leichhardt thus had gone far out of the straight route
to his destination. A more direct westerly course would
have greatly shortened his journey to Port Essington,
but it would have lessened the amount of good country
through which he was the first white man to pass. This
was one of the reasons why the time occupied by the
expedition was so much more lengthy than had been
originally calculated upon. To the north of the junc-
tion of the Burdekin and Clarke River, in latitude
U 1 18 , the party met with a stream which was
named the Perry. The country about here impressed
Leichhaidt as being highly suitable for pastoral pur-
poses. At the Perry the party camped, and killed and
cured another bullock. Writing of this time, Leich-
hardt gives a graphic and typical picture of the life of
the party during the journeyiugs of this period. He
writes as follows:
Hie routine of one of our days will serve as an
example of all the rest. I usually rise when I hear the
merry laugh of the laughing jackass —Dacelo gigantea—
which, from its regularity, has not been inaptly named
the settler s clock.' A loud cooee then rouses my com-
panions—Brown to make tea, Mr. Calvert to season the
stew with salt and marjoram, and myself and the others
to wash and to prepare our breakfast, which for the
party consists of two pounds and a half of meat stewed
over night, and to each a quart pot of tea. Mr. Calvert
then gives to each his portion, and by the time this
important duty is performed Charley generally arrives
with the horses, which are then prepared for their day's
duty. After breakfast Charley generally goes with
John and Murphy to fetch the bullocks, which are
generally brought in a little after seven o’clock a.m.
Ihe work of loading follows, but this requires very little
time now, our stock being much reduced, and at about
a quarter to eight o’clock we move on, and continue
travelling for hours, and if possible select a spot for our
camp.
Hie camp fixed and the horses and bullocks un-
loaded, we have all our allotted duties. To make the
fire falls to my share, Brown’s duty is to fetch water
for tea, and Mr. Calvert weighs out a pound and a half
of flour for a fat cake, which is enjoyed more than any
other meal. The large teapot being empty, Mr. Calvert


weighs out two pounds and a half of dry meat to be
stewed for our late dinner, and during the afternoon
everyone follows his own pursuit, such as washing and
mending clothes, repairing saddles, pack-saddles, and
packs. My occupation is to write my log and lay down
my route, or make an excursion in the vicinity of the
camp to botanize, etc., or ride out reoonnoitering. My
companions write down their remarks, and wander
about gathering seeds or looking for curioiis pebbles.
Mr. Gilbert takes his gun to shoot birds. A loud cooee
again unites us towards sunset around our tablecloth,
and while enjoying our meal the subject of the day’s
journey, the past, the present, and the future by turns
engage our attention and furnish matter for conversa-
tion and remark, according to the respective humour of
the parties. Many circumstances have conspired to
make me strangely taciturn, and I am now scarcely
pleased even with the chattering humour of my youngest
companion, whose spirits, instead of flagging, have
become more buoyant and lively than ever. I consider
it, however, my invariable duty to give every informa-
tion I can when my companions inquire or show a desire
to learn, and I am happy to find that they are desirous
of making themselves familiar with the objects of
Nature by which they are surrounded and of under-
standing their mutual relations. Mr. Roper is of a
more silent disposition. Mr. Calvert likes to speak,
and has a good stock of small talk, with which he often
enlivens our dinners. He is in that respect an excellent
companion, being full of jokes and stories, which though
old and sometimes quaint are also pure and serve the
more to exhilarate the party. Mr. Gilbert has travelled
much, and consequently has a rich store of impressions
de voyage; his conversation is generally very pleasing
and instructive in describing the characters of countries
he has seen and the manners and customs of the people
he has known. He is well informed in Australian
ornithology. As night approaches we retire to our beds.
The two blackfellows and myself spread out each on our
own under the canopy of heaven, whilst Messrs. Roper,
Calvert, Gilbert, Murphy, and Phillips have their
tents. Mr. Calvert entertains Roper with his conversa-
tion, John amuses Gilbert. Brown sings well, and his
melodious, plaintive voice lulls me to sleep when other-
wise I am not disposed. Mr. Phillips is rather singular in
his habits. He erects his tent generally at a distance from
the rest, under a shady tree or in a green bower of
shrubs, where he makes himself as comfortable as the
place will allow by spreading branches and grass under
his couch and covering his tent with them, to keep it
shady and cool, and even planting lilies in blossom—
Crinurn —before his tent to enjoy their sight during the
short time of our stay. As the night advances the
blackfellow’s songs die away, the chattering tongue of
Murphy ceases after having lulled Mr. Gilbert to sleep,
and at last Mr. Calvert is silent, as Roper’s short
answers became few and far between. The neighing of
the tethered horses, the distant tinkle of the bell, or
the occasional cry of the night-birds interrupt the silence
of our camp. The fire which was bright as long as the
corroboree songster kept it stirred gradually gets dull
and smoulders slowly under the large pot, in which our
meat is simmering, and the bright constellations pass
unheeded over the heads of the dreaming wanderers of
the wilderness until the summons of the laughing jackass
recalls them to the business of the day.”
Leichhardt writes on May 2 that he had travelled
in a north-west direction to latitude 18° 50' 11". At
first the party passed over box flats, alternating with
undulating open country; but about three miles before
making camp on the date quoted they traversed small
plains at the foot of what appeared to be basaltic ridges.
Here they found the dry channel of a river, in which
were several waterholes. The river seemed to come from
the west-north-west. Next day they travelled along the
bed of the river, the banks being too rugged to allow
of progress being made upon them. The stream was
the Lynd. The grass in this region was plentiful and
ample signs showed the blacks to be numerous, though
the latter apparently evaded the white men through
fear.
On the sth of the same month they came upon a
range dividing two watersheds. This line of mountains
varied from 2,000 to 3,000 feet in height. Tire highest
peak in view Leichhardt named Mount Lang, after Dr.
Lang. On June 1 the party were still travelling along
the Lynd, having observed several interesting customs
among the natives, who appeared to be fairly numerous
in that part of the country. Meanwhile another bul-
lock had been killed, whilst the flesh of a horse which
had fallen and broken its thigh while being ridden by
Mr. Roper, had also to be turned into dry meat. The
camp they were on at the opening of the month was
in latitude 17° 45' 40". The day after leaving this
spot they crossed three good-sized creeks which joined
the river. The course of the Lynd was to the north-
west, therefore coinciding, approximately, with the
direction which Leichhardt was desirous of following.
On the 6th of the month they passed and named
Kirchner Range. The river at this point was, in
places, fully half a mile broad. On the Bth the expe-
dition entered upon sandstone country, which showed a
marked change of vegetation. Ducks were num-
erous and proved easy to shoot, as many as
ten being sometimes obtained with a single shot. Native
companions also were plentiful, but were not easy to
approach. Along the river was noticed a kind of saw-
fish, which previously had always been supposed to
confine itself to fresh water. The natives in this region
were found to live in a manner altogether superior to


the mia-mia-inhabiting southerners. These northern
people used two-storied gunyas, made from strong poles
and bark and furnished with floorings. The character
of these abodes was considered to be the result of the
need for sleeping off the ground during the wet season.
Since the beginning of the month the party had been
without meat.
On June 16 they reached the junction of the Lynd
and the Mitchell, Leichhardt bestowing the latter name
in honour of the famous explorer. Just above the
meeting of the streams the Lynd narrowed considerably,
whilst the bed of the Mitchell was very broad and sandy
and showed signs of floods occurring much more fre-
quently than to be the case with the Lynd.
Only a small amount of water was running at that
time, but there were many large holes well filled.
Parallel with the river were many fine lagoons, both
large and deep and well stocked with fish. At this
point Murphy’s pony was poisoned, apparently by
eating some strange weed. Another bullock was
slaughtered here. Food was running short. On killing
the steer the party were able to dine on fried liver, but
the nearest approach to sugar was the water in which
had been boiled the ragged bags in which that com-
modity had been carried. The last of the flour had
been used up three weeks previously. The party had
already been much longer on the route than the six
months for which they carried provisions.
Along the Mitchell they encountered crocodiles for
the first time, and recognized this as a sign that they
were approaching the sea. A considerable change also
took place in the vegetation. The’ birds, too, became
different to those inhabiting the regions just left, whilst
the palm trees were very much larger. On June 25
Leichhardt decided that it would be more prudent to
leave the Mitchell and to proceed towards his destina-
tion by a more direct route. His intention was to
approach as near to the sea coast as would not impede
his progress, and then to pass round the bottom of the
Gulf to Port Essington. The following day, in lati-
tude 15° 52' 38 ", the expedition set off in a direction
almost due west. The immediate future contained
many annoyances. One of these being the
kites, which were so bold that one of them snatched a
skinned specimen of a new species of honey-sucker out
of Mr. Gilbert’s tin case, whilst, when the party were
eating meals, they perched round on the branches
of overhanging trees, and pounced on the plates in
their efforts to carry off food. But the most serious
trouble arose from the hostility of the natives, which
were very numerous. Whilst Brown and Charley were
looking for game near where the bullocks were feeding
they observed a native sneaking up to the latter,
evidently with the intention of driving the animals
towards a party of blacks, who were waiting with spears
poised to attack the little herd. Charley and Brown
by firing their guns, had no difficulty in driving away
the aborigines, but the incident somewhat alarmed
Leichhardt, as it denoted the possibility of greater
dangers to come.
On June 28 the party covered about nine miles
and crossed what they believed to be the Nassau. At
night a serious adventure occurred, which is best
described in the words of Leichhardt himself. The
explorer writes;
“At the end of our stage we came to a chain of
shallow lagoons, which were slightly connected by a
hollow. Many of them were dry, and fearing that if
we proceeded much farther we should not find water, I
camped on one of them containing a shallow pool. It
was surrounded by a narrow belt of small teatrees, with
stiff broad lanceolate leaves. As the water occupied
the lower part of this basin only, I deposited our
luggage on the upper part. Mr. Roper and Mr. Calvert
made their tent within the belt of trees, with its open-
ing towards the heap of luggage, whilst Mr. Gilbert
__and Murphy constructed theirs amongst the little trees,
with its entrance from the camp. Mr. Phillips’ was,
as usual, far from the others, and at the opposite side
of the water. Our fireplace was made outside of the
trees on the banks. Brown had shot six whistling ducks
and four teal, which gave us a good dinner, during
which the principal topic of conversation was our prob-
able distance from the sea coast, as it was here that we
first found broken seashells at the fires of the natives.
After dinner Messrs. Roper and Calvert retired to their
tent, and Mr. Gilbert, John, and Brown were plaiting
palm leaves to make a hat, and I stood musing near
their fireplace, looking at their work and occasionally
joining in their conversation. Mr. Gilbert was con-
gratulating himself upon having succeeded in learning
to plait, and when he had nearly completed a yard he
retired with John to their tent. It was about seven
o’clock, and I stretched myself on the ground, as usual,
at a little distance from the fire and fell into a doze,
from which I was suddenly aroused by a loud noise
and a call for help from Calvert and Roper. Natives
had suddenly attacked us. They had doubtless watched
our movements during the forenoon and marked the
position of the different tents, and as soon as it was
dark sneaked upon us and threw a shower of spears at
the tents of Calvert, Roper, and Gilbert, and a few at
that of Phillips, and also one or two towards the fire.
Charley and Brown called for caps, which I hastened
to find, and as soon as they were provided they dis-
charged their guns into the crowd of natives, who
instantly fled, leaving Calvert and Roper pierced with
several spears and severely beaten by waddies. Several
of these spears were barbed and could not be extricated
without difficulty. 1 had to force one through the arm


of Roper to break off the barb, and to cut another out
of the groin of Mr. Calvert. John Murphy had suc-
ceeded in getting out of the tent and concealing himself
behind a tree, whence he fired at the natives and
severely wounded one of them before Brown had dis-
charged his gun. Not seeing Mr. Gilbert, I asked for
him, when Charley told me our unfortunate companion
was no more. He had come out of his tent with his
gun, shot, and powder, and handed them to him, when
he instantly dropped down dead. Upon receiving this
affecting intelligence I hastened to the spot, and found
Charley’s account too true. He was lying on the ground
at a little distance from our fire, and upon examining
him I soon found, to my sorrow, that every sign of life
had disappeared. The body was, however, still warm,
and I opened the veins of both arms, as well as the
temporal artery, but in vain—the stream of life had
stopped and he was numbered with the dead.
elbow, and another on the back of his hand; besides
which a barbed spear had entered his groin. Both
suffered great pain, and were scarcely able to move.
The spear that had terminated poor Gilbert’s existence
had entered the chest between the clavical and the neck,
but made so small a wound that for some time I was
unable to detect it. From the direction of the wound
lie had probably received the spear when stooping to
leave his tent. The dawn of the morning (the 29th)
was gladly welcomed, and I proceeded to examine and
dress the wounds of my companions more carefully than
I had been able to do in the darkness of the night.
Very early we heard the cooees of the natives, who
seemed wailing as if one of their number was either
killed or severely wounded, for we found stains of blood
on their tracks. They disappeared, however, very soon,
for on reconnoitering the place I saw nothing of them.
I interred the body of our ill-fated companion in the
RANGES OF THE CAMP AT THE BURDEKIN, APRIL 20.
“As soon as we recovered from the panic into which
we were thrown by this fatal event every precaution
was taken to prevent another surprise. We watched
through the night, and extinguished our fires to conceal
our individual position from the natives. A strong
wind blew from the southward, which made the night
distressingly cold; it seemed as if the wind blew through
our bodies. Under all the circumstances that had
happened we passed an anxious night in a state of most
painful suspense as to the fate of our still-surviving
companions. Mr. Roper had received two or three
spear wounds in the scalp of his head; one spear had
passed through his left arm, another into his cheek
below the jugal bone and penetrated the orbit and
injured tlie optic nerve, and another in his loins, besides
a heavy blow on the left shoulder. Mr. Calvert had
received several severe blows from a waddy—one on the
nose, which had crushed the nasal bone, one on the
afternoon and read the funeral service of the Church of
England over him. A large fire was afterwards made
over the grave to prevent the natives detecting and
disturbing the body. Our cattle and horses, fortunately,
had not been molested.”
Next day the party remained in camp, and
Leichhardt describes Calvert and Roper as recovering
wonderfully. But great hazard lay in lingering in the
present locality, $0 on July 1 a start was made, the
leader having determined to see if the two wounded
men would be able to travel. The lives of the whole
party were at stake. Leichhardt felt that it was his
duty not to consider only the individual feelings and
wishes of the injured; but he continually watched their
wounds, and he took good care to force no more exertion
upon them than would be reasonably safe for them to
bear. On the first day they covered fourteen miles,
and continued their journey towards the Gulf until the


sth, when they came within eight of the sea. The
ground then was very dry, but it bore the appearance
of being impassable during the wet season. On the
same day as reaching the Gulf they came upon a fine
saltwater river, the hanks of which were clothed with
an open, well-grassed forest. The whole horizon here
appeared to be studded with smoke from the various
fires of natives, whilst near the stream many well-
beaten foot tracks were to he observed.
“The first sight of the salt water,” wrote Leich-
hardt, “was hailed by all with feelings of indescribable
pleasure, and by none more than by myself, although
tinctured with regret in not having succeeded in bring-
ing my whole party to the end of what I was sanguine
enough to think the most difficult part of my journey.
We had now discovered a line of communication by
land between the eastern coast of Australia and the
Gulf of Carpentaria. We had travelled along never-
failing and for the most part running waters, and over
an excellent country, available almost in its whole
extent for pastoral purposes.”
The party remained the whole of the next day in
camp, some of the men occupying the time in fishing,
whilst the animals grazed and rested. They had hoped
for a sufficient catch to enable a supply being dried,
but the whole product of the day’s work was a small
Silurus, a mullet, and some small guardfish. However,
Charley killed an emu on the following day, and this
yielded a small supply of animal food, which was all
too scarce. The party were now in a wide region of
plains on the south-eastern side of the Gulf, which
Captain Stokes had thought favourable for a settlement.
For the next two days the party travelled over country
which changed very little, and on the 9th they reached
Van Diemen River. The stream was from seventy to
eighty yards broad. In the bed of the river they saw
some well-constructed huts of natives. They were
made of branches arched over in the form of a birdcage
and thatched with grass and the bark of the drooping
teatree. It was apparent that the natives of the coastal
regions were more numerous and of a finer stamp than
were those of the interior, the reason being the more
plentiful and regular supply of food. There did not
appear to b 3 any signs of game about the vicinity, and
Leichhardt consequently determined to camp at the
spot and kill their last remaining steer. Next day this
task was performed, and on the 12th the journey was
continued. That day they crossed a stream, which was
named after their late comrade.
On the 17th of the month they reached the Carron,
finding the country along the route very destitute l of
game, though it appeared to be excellently suited to
pastoral purposes. However, as they advanced, the
bird life increased, and they were able to obtain ducks,
emus, and spoonbills. The party now crossed the
Plains of Promise, which had been so named by Captain
Stokes. Here the natives were very plentiful, and
Leichhardt had several friendly interviews with them,
but he remarks that they appeared to be better able to
understand him than he was to comprehend them.
They reached the Albert on August 6. Lmcliliardt
was not quite certain about the identity of the stream.
The journey round the head of the Gulf showed that
the Plains of Promise extended from Big Plain River
to the Nicholson, and that they stretched farthest to
the southward along two large saltwater rivers in the
apex of the Gulf. On the south these plains were
bounded by box flats and drained by numerous creeks,
which in their lower course were well filled with water.
On August 25 they came upon a lagoon, at which the
natives had erected an ingenious trap for catching
emus. The water was surrounded with a kind of
fence of dry sticks, containing an opening. The birds
entered by the latter to drink, and it was the practice
of the natives to then rush forward and by blocking the
one means of exit to easily capture the creatures, the
wings of which are too small in proportion to their
bodies to allow of them flying. Continuing parallel
with the shore of the Gulf the party crossed Moonlight
Creek, Smith Creek, the Marlow, Turner Creek, Went-
worth Creek, the Van Alpheu, Calvert River, and the
Abel Tasman River, the latter stream being reached on
September 9. Here the country was rocky and game
was plentiful. On the latter feature Leichhardt writes;
—“This noise of animal life during the night formed
an agreeable contrast to the dead silence which we had
observed at almost all our camps around the Gulf, with
the exception of one occupied on September 1 and of
that at the Marlow, where the flying fox was the reveller
of the night.”
The Seven Emu River was so named by Leichhardt
because so many emus had been killed there. They
next day reached the Robinson. The whole party were
now in a very bad way for both clothing and food.
Their shoes they had preserved by wearing mocassins
made from the hides of the bullocks which they had
killed. The clothes of Mr. Gilbert had been divided
among them, and added somewhat to their slender store.
Their tea was finished, as well as their sugar, and they
used the seeds of the sterculia, which they pounded and
boiled, for a drink. The emus shot in this country were
very dry and did not provide oil enough for frying their
own flesh.
On September 21 they came upon what Leichhardt
described as being the largest saltwater river they had
yet seen on their travels. They turned at once to the
west-south-west in order to head it. They found they
had to travel very much farther than they expected
in order to cross the stream, which they named the
Macarthur. Here they ran so short of animal food


that they were obliged to experiment with bullock hide
which they had with them. This they found made
excellent soup. A substitute for coffee was found in the
bean of the Mackenzie. Prom an interview he had
with natives here Leichhardt formed the impression that
they must have had intercourse with white men or
Malays, as they knew the use of knives and valued
them highly, besides which they appeared acquainted
with the use of firearms. The explorer concluded that
these aborigines had seen Malays, and that probably
some of them had accompanied the latter to the islands.
The river was crossed on the 26th of the month. A
good deal of distress had been suffered on account of
the scarcity of fresh water. The bullocks, one by one,
were knocking up and proving unable to carry their
loads. The horses appeared to have withstood the diffi-
cult conditions with very much greater endurance,
enabling Leichhardt and other members of the party to
a glowing description of the country he passed through
during the next few days, and on December 9 saw
the tracks of a buffalo, and two days later they managed
to shoot one, which enabled them to bring their last
remaining pack bullock as far as the destination of their
journey. The natives were very numerous and friendly.
They knew the settlement at Port Essington, which they
called ‘‘Balanda.”
Port Essington was reached on December 17, the
conclusion of the journey being perhaps best given in
the words of Leichhardt himself. He writes;—“On
the Vollir we came on a cart road, which wound round
the foot of a high hill, and having passed the garden,
with its fine cocoa-nut palms, the white houses and a
row of snug thatched cottages burst suddenly upon us,
the house of the Commandant being to the right and
separated from the rest. We were most kindly received
by Captain Macarthur, the Commandant of Port

take frequent reconnoitering excursions from the main
camps. However, the pack bullocks, being one by one
killed for food, greatly aided the party to cover this
difficult stage of their journey. Only one of these was
still surviving when the expedition was on the South
Alligator River, about sixty miles from its mouth, and
within 140 mTes from Port Essington. This was on
November 24. Previously to that Leichhardt had been
obliged to abandon many of his specimens in order to
lessen the loads to be carried. The drowning of a horse
at the end of October while crossing a river had reduced
the number of these animals to nine.
Two days later the horses and the bullock strayed
from the camp, and when Charley returned with the stock
he was accompanied by a whole tribe of natives, who
followed the explorers for some considerable distance,
rendering valuable assistance by showing the way over a
difficult swamp to firmer ground. Leichhardt gave
Essington, and by the other officers, who with the
greatest kindness and attention supplied us with every-
thing that we wanted. I was deeply affected in finding
myself again in civilized society, and could scarcely
speak, the words growing big with tears and emotion,
and even now, when considering with what small means
the Almighty had enabled me to perform such a long
journey, my heart thrills in grateful acknowledgment
of His infinite kindness.”
The party remained a month at Port Essington,
and then embarking in the schooner "Heroine arrived
at Sydney on March 29, 1846, greatly to the astonish-
ment and much to the delight of the geneial public,
who had come to regard them as the "lost explorers.
That they had lost their lives in the interior had long
been the accepted belief. Indeed, Mr. Hodgson had
been despatched with a party to investigate certain
reports about the expedition haying been murdered.


He had returned with the conviction that the party
were safe, as the stories told him by different tribes ot
natives were so contradictory. That was during 1845,
but as Leichhardt still did not appear the fears of
people again asserted themselves, A public subscrip-
tion was raised to reward the explorers for the many
trials and adventures through which they had passed,
in achieving so much that would stimulate pastoral
enterprise in the Colony. A sum of X 1,500 was soon
raised, and the Government of New South Wales added
XI,OOO to it. Dr. Leichhardt received X 1,454 as his
share of the amount; Calvert and Roper, X 125 each;
Murphy, X7O; Phillips, X3O and a free- pardon; and
the aborigines, Brown and Charley, were each given X 25.
CHAPTER X.
THE KATE OF LEICHHARDT.
After his long and arduous expedition, Dr.
Leichhardt was not content to remain long in idleness.
Early in 1847 he set out with an expedition to explore
the country between the last route followed by Sir
Thomas Mitchell and that which he himself had followed
on his way to Port Essington. In this enterprise,
however, he was doomed to disappointment. A whole
series of accidents rendered it impossible to continue the
undertaking, and he was forced to return. But failure
stirred him only to more strenuous and risky under-
takings. It was then that he planned, organized, and
set out upon the journey from which none of his party
ever returned.
The intention was to cross the Continent from east
to west, and Leichhardt estimated that this would take
a period of two and a half years. Howitt, in his
“Discovery in Australia/' concisely gives the full
objects of the enterprise in the following words; —“The
object cf the new enterprise was to explore the interior
of Australia; to discover the extent of Sturt’s Desert
and the character of the western and north-western
coast, so as to observe the gradual change in animal life
from one side of the country to the other. It is obvious
that what Stuart, Gregory, McKinlay, Howitt, and
others have since seen of this great western desert that
it was next to an impossibility to penetrate through it
after a long and exhausting journey from the eastern
coast. Instead of a central it was shown to be a
western desert, and at the spot where Mr. Walker in
1862 came upon his trail, and saw trees marked with
the letter ‘L’—namely, in latitude 22° and longitude
145°—he was moving directly towards this terrible
desert, yet he was considerably to the east of Lands-
borough’s track from the Gulf of Carpentaria south-
ward, which skirted this desert ; at least 250 miles east
of McKinlay’s track, and 350 miles east of the track of
Burke and Wills, which still only passed partially
through it. He had, therefore, little less than 2,000
miles between him and the western coast, and nearly
the whole of it through this burning desert, which has
still defied every effort to penetrate it in that direction,
and which has defied all the efforts of explorers from
south to north, except those of Burke and Wills at the
east of this line, and Stuart’s, made by successive efforts
from different points. No wonder then that he never
reappeared, and that the fate of himself and all his
party remains a mystery to be solved.”
Leichhardt started from Sydney for Moreton Bay
in October, 1847. His companions on this fatal expedi-
tion were Hentig, Classen (who was a German and a
relative of the doctor), Kelly, Donald Stuart, Womai
and Billy. The stock consisted of fifty bullocks, twenty
mules and six horses. Mr. ,1. P, Robinson had presented
twenty of the bullocks, whilst the Government gave the
remaining thirty. The provisions included 800 lb. of
flour, 100 lb. of salt, and 120 lb. of tea. They also
took 250 lb. of shot and 40 lb. of powder. The original
intention was to get to the Barcoo, which Mitchell had
found and named the Victoria, describing the country
surrounding it in glowing terms; or else to follow his
old route as far as the Peak Range and then to strike-
off to the westward. Leichhardt appeared to think it
probable that need for water would force him to reach
the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and then to
follow a river to its southern source. Pie would then
endeavour to reach the Swan River by whichever route
proved practicable. In a letter of February 26, 1848,
he said he would proceed down the Condamine, and
then, following Mitchell’s track to the most northern
bend of the Cooper, making northward until finding
some substantial watercourse falling in the Gulf, then
striking to the westward. At that time he expected
to reach the Swan River at the end of 1849 or the
beginning of 1850. What he ultimately did has been
veiled in mystery since he left the limits of settlement.
Trees marked by him have been found in the Clermont
district, where the Peak Range lies, but human and
goats’ hair discovered among the natives of the Cooper
are usually considered to be evidences of his having
penetrated far to the south-west of the former region,
and of having lost his life there, together with those of
his comrades.
A long time elapsed before alarm was felt at the
continued absence of the party. It had set out on a
trip which, under normal conditions, was to take two
and a half years. Probably all the members had long


since been dead before the least anxiety was felt. But
towards the end of 1850 the expedition was nearly three
years out and no word had been received from any
of the members. Even then public feeling did not
appear strong enough to manifest itself in the form of a
relief party.
It was not until January of 1852 that Mr. Hovenden
Hely was sent in charge of an expedition to search the
Gulf country, in the hope of picking up the tracks of
the lost explorer and following them up. The party
consisted of seven white men and three blacks, and sup-
plemented with sixteen horses, fifteen mules, and provi-
sions for nine months. Hely started from the Darling
Downs, proceeded northward, and followed up the
Dawson. Near the Peak Range, at a spot he knew, he
hoped to find letters from Leichhardt, or other traces
of the missing explorer. But he was disappointed in this
hope. From the Balonne River Hely wrote in July to the
Colonial Secretary, relating stories he had heard from
was fired, that killing one of the aborigines. The
horses and mules, he continued, had all been killed,
but the bullocks had escaped into the forest, where they
were still to be met with. When on the Maranoa, in
latitude 26° 4', Hely was told a similar story by some
gins, who said that after seven days’ journey onward
he would find where the massacre had taken place, at
a spot he would be able to distinguish by the large
number of saddles and accoutrements lying about.
Afterwards an old woman told of how a flood had
drowned the lost explorers. Little credence was placed
in the latter tale, because it was believed that, were it
true, the natives would have been able afterwards to
collect a quantity of the belongings of the deceased
men, and that these, or some of them, would still remain
in the tribe. Nor did the murder theory remain
tenable, for ten miles beyond where it was alleged to
have taken place, and where there were no remains such
as those described, a tree was found bearing upon it
LAGOON NEAR S. ALLIGATOR.
the natives of a party of white men having been mut -
dered by blacks at a spot ten days’ journey from Mount
Abundance. In consequence of this he altered his
course. Two of the blacks, who professed to be
acquainted with the circumstances of the massacre, led
Hely to one of Mitchell’s old camping-places, where he
gathered up some bones of sheep and other leavings as
proof of the sensational tale. One of the aborigines, a
boy of sixteen, recounted what must have been a fiction
of his imagination, in which he said he remembered the
murder of Leichhardt’s whole party, which had taken
place some years before, and which had resulted from
two of the blacks who were accompanying the white men
ill-using native women. After the ill-treatment, he
related that the tribe had followed the explorers for
some days, and ultimately had speared the whole party
in the night. Most of the victims, according to this
story, must have been sleeping, because only one shot
j 2
the mark of Leichhardt and surrounded by what
obviously had been one of his camps.
Hely was now induced, by the stories still being
told him by the blacks, to search much further onwards
for the scene of the massacre, and two of the natives
set out to accompany him as his guides to the spot.
But before the explorer could reach the locality the
aborigines fled from his camp. This occurred in lati-
tude 25° 21'. Walker afterwards ascertained that
Leichhardt had penetrated very much to the north of
this spot, his track being found in latitude 22° 30',
between the Belyando and Thomson Rivers.
Provisions began to fail after Hely had proceeded
some distance further, and the party returned, the
leader believing that the stories of the massacre must
have been true. On the return journey they came
upon a black who had absconded, and the latter
explained his conduct by saying that the guides had


been deluding Hely and would never have revealed the
place of the tragedy for fear of being speared by their
countrymen as a consequence.
The account of the blacks was not generally believed
when brought back by Hely. The natives had told the
same story, but this was considered the result of some
one of them having first invented the romance, which
then had been repeated in its original form. That this
spirit of scepticism was justified, and Hely wrong in his
conclusions, was proved afterwards by subsequent dis-
coveries. But the evidence collected has all been of a
negative character, so far as the actual fate of the party
is concerned. What actually happened at the last
remains veiled in mystery. But the most likely
theory certainly is that the explorers pushed farther
into the desolate interior desert than they could recede
from, and that they died of hunger or thirst in the
dead heart of the Continent, which, being crossed so
seldom, might contain their bones exposed for a century
without discovery, if, indeed, all remains were not
covered by the moving sands of that arid region.
The following letter, which appeared in the Mel-
bourne Age on December 21, 1864, written by prominent
men of that time who took a profound interest in the
fate of Leichhardt, is of interest.
“The return of our fellow-colonist, Mr. Duncan
Mclntyre, of Glengower, from a most important explor-
ing journey to the Gulf of Carpentaria, during which our
knowledge of the movements of Leichhardt and his party
has been widely extended, prompts us to request your
powerful support in a call on all Australia not to allow
the fate of this intrepid, self-sacrificing, and perhaps not
yet perished explorer, to remain any longer concealed in
mystery. The occasion is simultaneously afforded us,
through the attentive courtesy of Mr. Mclntyre, to
promulgate in a brief outline the main results of the
geographical achievements of this gentleman, who at
once so brilliantly has entered on the eventful stage of
Australian exploration, on which we shall still have to
witness many a stirring scene, Mr. Mclntyre started
from the Paroo, travelled onwards to Coopers Creek,
which he crossed at latitude 26 degrees 10 minutes south,
followed it up to 25 degrees 50 minutes south, and struck
thence across the north-westerly to a new important
river, which he named in honour of the Rev. Joseph
Docker, of Wangaratta, one of the most generous sup-
porters of the original Victorian expedition. From the
Docker River, on a north-westerly course, Mr. Mclntyre
reached the Mueller River of Mr. McKinlay, crossing
this watercourse in 23 degrees south. Continuing his
north-western direction, he met about a degree further
west, and in about 22 degrees south the very faint tracks
of animals, seemingly either goats or sheep, and horses,
or cattle, at a spot not known to have been traversed by
any explorer. From hence, a system chiefly of granite
mountains sends its ramifications in two main lines,
south-west and north-west. On a new principal tributary
of the Flinders River, rising on the north-west flank of
this mountain trace, Mr. Mclntyre passed to the main
stream of the Flinders, observing in about 20 degrees
40 minutes south and about one degree westward of
Burke and Wills’ track, two old horses, an event to which
much importance can be attached, when it is remembered
that neither the Victorian explorers, nor Landsborough,
nor A. Gregory, nor Leichhardt, in his first glorious
expedition, abandoned any horses in any adjacent
locality, Mr. Walker’s horses being left 300 miles to the
east. A still more important discovery rewarded Mr.
Mclntyre’s exertions after having reached on the Flin-
ders line, the Carpentaria Gulf; for on his return
journey, whilst following up the main east branch of the
Flinders River, he noticed on its western bank, in
approximate latitude, 20 degrees south two trees, each
bearing a larger L, no number attached as a mark,
indicating, as we, with Mclntyre, feel convinced a Leich-
hardtian camp. With this position, the traces of Leich-
hardt, recently found on the Alice River, can be brought
into a line of contact. These L’s are clearly distinct from
any marks of Landsborough’s camps, who in that
latitude, kept the eastern bank of the Flinders River,
and who moreover, attached a consecutive number to his
marked camp trees. If further proofs of distinction
were wanting, we might add that the bark had
encroached to the extent of four or five inches on the
incision of the L’s, whereby a much greater age of the
letters is established than that of Landsborough’s camps;
and still further we have the evidence of one of the
natives, who served both in Landsborough’s and
Mclntyre’s expedition, declaring the camp foreign
to the expedition of the former gentleman. The
position of these momentous trees being in
flooded ground, it would have been in vain to
search for further camp traces. Mr. Mclntyre, in
carrying out a judiciously arranged plan, went home-
ward near Landsborough’s tracks, to the source of Bulla,
and finally from this river to the Paroo, accomplishing
in twenty weeks a journey, by which he has secured a
prominent and honourable position amongst our
explorers, and this by slender and entirely private means,
accompanied only by one of his countrymen and five
aborigines.
“Shall, whilst we can avail ourselves of the talents
of tried and spirited travellers, like Mr, Mclntyre and
Mr. Giles, the fate of one of the most famed explorers
which the world ever possessed, remain uncared for ?
Shall the destiny of him, who, in Australia, discovered
the 'North-west passage,’ remain still for an indefinite
period unascertained ? And shall the revelation of the
fate of this truly great man be any longer left to the
chances of mere accident ?

CHAPTER XI.
LAST EXPEDITION OF SIR THOMAS MITCHELL.
Of all the expeditions of exploration to penetrate
the interior of Queensland, none returned with a more
glowing account of what then was the northern section
of New South Wales than did that led by Sir Thomas
Mitchell during 1846. The story brought back by this
most successful of travellers through the unknown
regions of the new Continent had a great deal to do
with stimulating subsequent pastoral enterprise in what
hitherto had been neglected tracts of country of great
productivity, for few authorities had established so
high a reputation, both for accuracy of judgment and
for richness in discovery.
Whatever undue optimism
regarding its future useful-
ness for industrial purposes
may have been displayed in
Mitchell’s picture of the in-
land tropical belt of Eastern
Australia resulted, not from
faulty observation nor from
hasty calculation in the in-
terpretation of evidence, but
from the very simple fact
that the country, during
the period at which the
party passed through it, was
experiencing a more than
usually bounteous season.
Large areas conspicuous in
1846 for dense tangles of
luxuriant grasses and herbs,
twelve years later, when
crossed by Augustus C.
Gregory, were nothing more
than desolate wastes, sup-
porting not a green leaf or a
living plant; whilst the
absence of water in places
threatened the travellers
with annihilation if they should dare to push further
into so inhospitable a desert.
The exploring party which set out from Parramatta
on November 17, 1845, intending to strive for the dis-
covery of a passage to the north coast within the neigh-
bourhood of Torres Strait, or as near to that highway
of the sea as should prove practicable, was the fourth
and the last led by Sir Thomas Mitchell. Though not
successful in accomplishi.ig the main purpose for which
it had been organized, the enterprise certainly proved
prolific in bringing to light a wealth of new facts
regarding the pastoral probabilities of a wide and
wealthy region which never before had come within the
vision cf civilized men. Considerable disappointment
was felt by the leader at not being able to penetrate
to a latitude which would have opened the way to
establishing a pathway to the northern coast; but it
was the absence of just those qualities of leadership
which, causing this expedition, as they did, to turn bad
at the critical point, allowed less-wisely directed parties
to march on to their destruction among the waterless
wastes and hostile blacks of the interior.
At the time when the enterprise was undertaken,
Mitchell stood in the fore-
front of Australian explorers,
and the passing of subse-
quent years has certainly
done nothing in the direction
of lessening the high stand-
ing won by him for the exer-
cise of all those qualities
most needed for traversing
the unknown wilderness, for
correctly estimating the
character and value of new
land, and for graphically
describing the results of his
investigation. In his stan-
dard work on Australian ex-
ploration and explorers, Wil-
liam Howitt, after comment-
ing on the work accomplished
by this leader in 1846,
wrote: —“On the whole Sir
Thomas [Mitchell] must be
ranked amongst the greatest
of Australian explorers, and
the discovery of the vast ex-
tent of fine country on
the Namoi, the Barwon, the
Culgoa, the Maranoa, the
Claude, the Belyando and Barcoo rivers was a most
important service to the Colony. He survived eight
years to reap the fame and satisfaction of his successful
enterprises in the opening up of the north-eastern por-
tion of the Continent. He finished his very useful career
on October 5, 1855, at his residence near Sydney. Besides
his services in cutting roads through the Blue Moun-
tains, in surveying and mapping various districts
of the Colony, and bus well-known achievements
as an explorer, Sir Thomas was equally devoted to
literature and mechanics and was an accomplished
classical scholar.”
SIR THOMAS MITCHELL.


The immediate object sought after by the Govern
meat of New South Wales in launching Mitchell’s last,
expedition was the desire to discover and open up a
route towards the Indian Ocean which might be used
by breeders and dealers exporting horses to the military
authorities in India. The trade in remounts, which has
continued ever since, already had commenced, and had
been handicapped by the difficulties involved in navi-
gation through Torres Strait. “But other considera-
tions,” wrote Mitchell, “not less important to the
colonists of New South Wales, made it very desirable
that a way should be opened to the shores of the Indian
Ocean. That sea was already connected with England
by steam navigation, and to render it accessible to
Sydney by land was in itself an object worthy of an
exploratoi'y expedition. In short, the commencement
of such a journey seemed the first step in the direct
road to England, for it was not to be doubted that on
the discovery of a good overland route between Sydney
and the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria a line of steam
communication would thereupon be introduced from
that point to meet the English line at Singapore.” The
route particularly desired, should one prove practicable,
lay to the head of the Gulf. On the evidence then
available, the probabilities pointed to some considerable
river emptying itself into the sea in that neighbourhood.
The expedition was projected in 1845, when the
Legislative Council, the then legislature of the parent
Colony, voted £I,OOO towards the expenses of the under-
taking. The matter, however, was referred to the
home Government by Sir George Gipps, the Governor,
a delay somewhat resented by Mitchell, who had been
working on the plans of the enterprise since 1843. Sir
Thomas at the time was Surveyor-General of New South
Wales, and one of the reasons prompting the journey
to the north lay in the fact that his department had
been reduced to a state of inactivity in no way suited
to the taste of a person of the veteran explorer’s bound-
less flow of natural energy. The irritation felt on the
part of the intended leader at the postponement of his
scheme being carried into operation was not eased by
the Governor —after the belated start had been decided
upon, the permission of the Imperial authorities having
been obtained —attempting to lay down directions which
the party were to follow. Sir George Gipps was an
engineer by profession, but he certainly was in posses-
sion of no knowledge of the technical character which
would have justified him in endeavouring to interfere
with the leadership or preliminary arrangements of an
explorer of the calibre of Sir Thomas Mitchell. An
unfortunate result in the Governor having referred to
Downing Street, what he had ample power to decide
himself, was the loss of the services of the ill-fated Dr.
Leichhardt. Whatever defects that enthusiastic ex-
plorer may have held in leadership would not have
influenced the results of the 184 G enterprise, whilst his
assistance in the capacity of naturalist, a post he was
eminently fitted to successfully fill, would have added
to the useful scientific data brought back from the
fertile north. Impatient at waiting for the doubtful
setting forth of Sir Thomas’s party, Leichhardt collected
six persons, obtained the necessary financial assistance
by public subscription, and set out inland from Moreton
Bay. When the larger expedition began its wanderings
Leichhardt was in some unknown part of the wilderness,
and as the subsequent months slipped by without any
signs of his reappearance, fears as to his safety hardened
into feelings of certainty at a tragedy having overtaken
the scientist, together with his brave companions. His
ultimate reappearance at Sydney, which he reached
from Port Essington by sea, has already been told in the
previous chapter.
On receipt of the sanction of the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, the Governor refused to allow
Mitchell’s enterprise to proceed. However, the Legis-
lative Council renewed the petition originally made by
them for the undertaking to be launched, and when Sir
George Gipps abandoned the obstinate obstruction he
had raised against the scheme being carried into effect
the legislative body increased the vote from £I,OOO to
£2,000.
In the middle of December the expedition made its
real start from Buree, the party consisting or
twenty-nine persons, of whom all but six were
prisoners of the Crown in different stages of
probation. Besides the chief of the expedition, the
free men were as follows:—Edward B. Kennedy, second
in command; W. Stephenson, M.R.C.S.L., surgeon and
collector of objects of natural history; Peter M’Avoy,
mounted vidette; Anthony Brown, tentkeeper; and
William Baldock, keeper of the horses. The others,
together with their functions, were as follows:—Two
mounted videttes, a storekeeper, eight bullock-drivers,
two carpenters, a blacksmith, a shoemaker, a barometer
carrier, two chainmcn, two keepers of horses, a carter
and pioneer, a shepherd and butcher, and a sailmaker
and sailor. The inclusion of the last on the list may
seem a strange provision to be made in a party about
to explore a country for the most part so arid that the
scarcity of drinking water presents the most serious
danger met with. But the fact was that Sir Thomas
made it his practice to take one or two portable boats
to enable him the more exjreditiously to cross whatever
formidable rivers might be met with. Experience had
shown him the character of the interior of the Continent
to be such that rains not unusually falling at certain
seasons of the year might convert the dry bed of a water-
course, usually consisting of but a chain of stagnant
holes, into a flowing sea many miles wide, and in the
channel from thirty to sixty feet in depth. Many men,


free and bound, had volunteered to form part of the
expedition, and a wide field of selection therefore had
been presented. At Buree two black guides were in-
cluded in the staff. These were Piper, who had accom-
panied Sir Thomas on a former journey of exploration,
and a native named Yuranigh.
M eans of locomotion consisted of eight drays, each
drawn by ten bullocks, three light horse carts, seventeen
horses, and two boats. Tire supply of provisions was
calculated to last for a year, and included a flock of
250 sheep. Probably no better equipped body ever set
out to explore the interior of Australia, though larger
sums of money had been spent on others. The total
fund available for Messrs. Burke and Wills, when their
ill-fated enterprise was being organized, amounted to
0£12,400, with the assurance that more money would be
forthcoming should it be required at a subsequent date.
might have followed. The general differentiation of
labour marking the whole of the arranging of the staff
carried with it a definite fixing of responsibility in
regard to every necessary duty which made wholly for
efficiency, and contributed in no small degree to the
success following the various enterprises controlled and
managed by the Surveyor-General. The one error which
Sir Thomas appears to have fallen into in this preliminary
planning lay in choosing bullocks instead of horses, and
thereby being forced to travel slowly at times when
important results might have been attained by increased
mobility.
The last of the settled northern country was reached
on January 4, 1846, if, indeed, the rough skeleton
industry of that early-day squatting could be regarded
as involving real settlement. The mid-summer heat
was intense, and the shortage of water imposed painful
VICTORIA SQUARE, PORT ESSINGTON IN 1846.
Experience and sound judgment enabled Mitchell to
restrict his encumbrances to articles for which real need
existed, whilst it was never the lot of those under his
command to suffer hardship or danger through the
omission of things for which the work in hand and the
particular difficulties to be overcome created a use. In
1861 the party led by Frederick Walker successfully
from the Pacific Coast to the shores of the Gulf of
Carpentaria and back, stumbled over the last few
hundred miles bootless and with bruised and bleeding
feet. Sir Thomas protected his men from that kind of
disaster—one which easily might lead to loss of life.
The services of one man to be set aside for the care
of the barometer might seem like a waste of labour;
but it had been through some slight oversight in the
care of scientific instruments that other expeditions had
been robbed of the valuable results which otherwise
privations upon the explorers, considerable delay being
occasioned. Trouble was experienced with Piper, the
black guide, who was discovered to entertain feelings
of disloyalty to his white companions, so that it was
deemed wise to send him back to Bathurst in charge of
a trooper. Lengthy halts had to be made at places
where water and grass could be obtained. A welcome
change in the weather occurred early in February, and
a flood in the channel of the Macquarie River, seen at
this time, proved one of the most impressive and interest-
ing sights met with by the members of the party during
the whole of the expedition. Attracted to the bank
of the stream by the low but steadily-increasing mur-
muring noise, punctuated by cracking sounds like the
snapping of the branches of trees, they had not to wait
long before a mighty flood came surging towards them.
“By very slow degrees,” wrote Mitchell afterwards,


describing the event, “the sound grew louder, and at
length so audible as to draw various persons besides
myself from the camp to the riverside. Still no flood
appeared, although its approach was indicated by the
occasional rending of trees with a loud noise. Such a
phenomenon on a most serene moonlight night was
quite new to us all. At length the rushing sound of
waters and loud cracking of timber announced that the
flood was in the next bend. It rushed into our sight,
glittering in the moonbeams—a moving cataract, toss-
ing before it ancient trees and snapping them against
its banks. It was preceded by a point of meandering
water, picking its way like a thing of life through the
deepest parts of the dark, dry, and shady bed of what
thus again became a flowing river. I am convinced
the scene can never be forgotten by my party, situ-
ated as we were at that time, beating about the country
and impeded in our journey solely by the almost total
absence of water, suffering excessively from thirst and
extreme heat. Here came at once abundance—the product
of storms in the far-off mountains that overlooked our
homes. The first impulse was to welcome this flood on
our knees, for the scene was sublime in itself, while
the subject—an abundance of water sent to us in a
desert—greatly heightened the effect to our eyes. Suffice
to say, I had witnessed nothing of such interest in all
my Australian travels. . . . The river gradually
filled up the channel nearly bank high, while the living
cataract travelled onward, much slower than I had ex-
pected to see it; so slowly, indeed, that more than an
hour after its first arrival the sweet music of the head
of the flood was distinctly audible from my tent, as the
murmur of waters and the diapason crash of logs
travelled slowly through the tortuous windings of the
river bed. ... I was finally lulled to sleep by that
melody of living waters, so grateful to my ear and
evidently so unwonted in the dry bed of the thirsty
Macquarie."
Yet even after the long-desired rain had filled the
watercourses and replenished the billabongs the progress
of the party was so slow that the twenty-ninth degree of
latitude'—the present boundary between New South
Wales and Queensland —was not reached until March
26. Not only did bullocks prove to be very much slower
than horses, but the endurance of the former was con-
siderably lower than was that of the latter. During the
period when scarcity of water presented the principal
difficulty for Sir Thomas to overcome, he was able to
take his whole party over only short stages separating
sources of supply, so that, except in the case of small
advance expeditions of horsemen, his capacity for pene-
trating into arid regions was less than it would have
been had he depended entirely on horses for locomotion
and transport. The journal of the leader contains
numerous complaints at the delay caused through this
element of weakness, probably the only error of any
seriousness committed by Mitchell in his original plans.
During the latter half of February and March the soft-
yielding nature of the ground raised another obstacle in
the way of fast travelling. The twenty-ninth parallel
was approached within the neighbourhood of the Narrau
River, the route crossing many swamps and lying, for
almost every mile, over land nearly as level as the
proverbial billiard-table.
The movement of the expedition after the end of
March was filled with interest to the student of the
genesis of Queensland settlement. The Balonne River
was reached on April 1. Mitchell described it
as “as fine a looking river as I have seen in
the Colony, excepting only the Murray. There
was a slight current, and the waters lay in broad
reaches, under banks less elevated above the bed than
those of the Darling. In breadth the channel surpassed
that of the last-named river in any part, I believe, of
its course." The day was occupied in prepar-
ing a ford for crossing on the following morning.
This was effected by filling a shallow place with logs,
branches of trees, and earth. Near this spot a native
jminted out two trees on which were marked “J. Towns"
and “Bagot, 1845," evidences convincing Sir Thomas
he was at or near a place called “Congo," where his
son, Commissioner Mitchell, had crossed the Balonne
just before discovering the Culgoa. Having forded the
river the party that day covered seven miles and camped
for the night near the junction of the Balonne and
Culgoa rivers.
From the Culgoa Mitchell set off in a northerly
direction. “In gaining the right bank of the Culgoa,"
he wrote, in review of the experiences of the previous
weeks, “we had crossed the vast basin of clay extending
from the Bogan on the south to this river on the north,
and westward to New Year’s Range and Fort Bourke
(in New south Wales). The country was liable to be
rendered quite impassable had the rains set in. But
even in such seasons we could still travel over the dry,
firm ground bounding this basin of clay on the north-
ward, as the left bank of the Bogan was also passable,
however rainy the season; indeed, more conveniently
than during a dry one. Rain, if it had fallen at this
time, had greatly facilitated our exploration of the
northern interior, but these rivers we had reached would
supply us with water for some degrees to the northward,
as I had been informed by the commissioner of the
district, and in our progress so far, I hope that we
should arrive at a better watered country." At this
point Mitchell followed the practice of marking a tree
at each camping-place, a habit afterwards adopted by
Leichhardt, and proving of considerable service to those
to whom fell the task of tracking the route of the last
journey.


For some distance the party followed the course
ot the Balonne, which was found to develop into a
magnificent stream, flowing through fertile, well-grassed
land, opening to a width of 120 yards, and in one
spot containing a lake surrounding some large islands.
This sheet of water was named Lake Parachute, and was
described by the commander as being a lagoon supplied
by floods from the river. It formed a home and feed-
ing-place for thousands of ducks, pelicans, and other
aquatic birds. This attractive region was reached on
April 11. A few miles higher up the stream, where
the water attained its maximum width, a natural bridge
of rock was found. The commander was now desirous
of selecting a camp where he could leave the main
portion of his party, while he himself, with a small,
well-mounted detachment, might proceed more rapidly
preparations to better fit the main body of the expedition
for the continuance of the travels. This work selected
included ‘‘the stuffing of saddles, shoeing of horses,
drying of mutton, and, first of all in importance though
the least likely of accomplishment, the making of a pair
of new wheels for a cart to carry water.”
The 15th was occupied by Kennedy in taking a
preliminary survey of the country in the direction Sir
Thomas was contenrplating travelling. The former
spent until ten o’clock at night on his ride, the result
of which confirmed the intention of the leader to strike
off to the north-west at practically a right angle from
the general course of the river. ‘‘ln order better
to contend with the difficulty of wanting water,”
wrote the commander, “and be better prepared
for it, I formed my party rather of infantry than of
RIVER BALONNE.
to the north-west. The cattle had become low in con-
dition, several of them had been galled on the shoulders
through pulling at their yokes, and they needed rest at
some well-grassed and well-watered halting-place.
While they should gain in strength, Mitchell might
ascertain the further course of the river, and push for-
word with his work of exploration in the required
direction. The district immediately surrounding this
ready-made ford offered just such facilities as were
required. Arrangements to carry the plan into effect
were proceeded with at once. Sir Thomas Mitchell
was not the type of leader to permit any of his men
to idle away their time while the jaded cattle were
picking up lost condition. For the occupation of those
who did not accompany him he set on foot various
cavalry, taking only two horses, drawing a cart loaded
chiefly with water, and six trusty men, all old soldiers.
We were thus prepared to spend several nights without
requiring other water than what we carried with us.
I hoped thus to be able to penetrate the scrubs and
reach, perhaps cross, the higher land bounding this
great basin.”
The four following days were spent mostly in
hewing a track for the carts through rough scrub lands,
where no water was found. On the 19th they were
overtaken by two horsemen from the main party, bear-
ing a despatch received from Commissioner Wright,
communicating the news of Dr. Leichhardt’s return
from Port Essington, and enclosing a Gazette containing
that explorer’s own account of his journey. This


meant, of course, that Sir Thomas Mitchell could not
hope to be the first to reach the north coast by land.
The whole detachment thereupon returned to the main
camp, which was reached on the 21st. The commander
determined to set out at once for the head of the Gulf
under whatever promised to be the most expeditious
system for getting there.
Two days later Sir Thomas started on his effort to
accomplish the main purpose of his expedition. His
plan was to leave at the depot, which w r as found to be
adjacent to a great tract of excellent pastoral land, the
weakest of his stock and the most difficult of transport
of his equipment. Experience caused him to include
the bullocks within this qualification. He took with
him eight men, two native boys, fourteen horses, three
carts, and sufficient provisions to last fourteen weeks.
Mitchell’s intention was, he wrote, “if possible to pene-
trate northward into the interior country, and ascertain
where the division of the waters was likely to be found.
i intended, with this view, to trace upwards the course
of the Balonne until I found mountains to the north-
westward of it; then to endeavour to turn them by the
west, and thus acquire some knowledge on that most
interesting point, the watershed towards the Gulf. I
left instructions with Mr. Kennedy to follow my tracks
with the drays and main body of the party, and to set
out on Monday, May 4, when the cattle would have
had three weeks’ rest.” Having in this way obtained
information of the division between the watershed, Sir
Thomas hoped to then be able to penetrate to the shores
of the Gulf itself.
For the first few days the route of the explorers
took them through fertile, grassy flats, wide,
magnificent reaches of river, stately open timber,
and firm soil upon which to walk, ride, or
drive gave beauty and enjoyment to the daily
task. None were able to appreciate such things better
than was Sir Thomas Mitchell, who combined the
experienced judgment of an expert with the eye of an
artist. “Masses of rock,” he wrote, “lofty trees,
shining sands and patches of water, in wild confusion,
afforded evidence of the powerful current that sometimes
moved there and overwhelmed all. At this time the
outlines were wild, the tints sublimely beautiful.
Mighty trees of casuarinae, still inclined as they had
been made to bend before the waters, contrasted finely
with erect mimosae, witli prostrate masses of driftwood,
and with perpendicular rocks. Then the hues of the
anthistiria grass, of a red-brown, contrasted most har-
moniously with the light-green bushes, grey driftwood,
blue water, and verdure by its margin; all these again—
grass, verdure, driftwood, and water—were so opposed
to the dark hues of the casuarinae, mimosae, and rifted
rocks, that a Ruysdael or a Gainsborough might there
have found an inexhaustible stock of subjects for their
pencil. . . . Noble reaches next extended in fine
perspective before us; each for several miles presenting
open grassy margins, along which we could travel on
firm ground unimpeded by scrub. At length I per-
ceived before me a junction of rivers, and'could see
along each of them nearly a mile.” At this spot the
travellers found many recent native encampments, some
of them containing fires still burning.
The Maranoa was discovered on May 1, Mi tchell
coming upon the stream at the point where it joins the
Balonne. The party adhered to the course of the
Balonne, crossing the Maranoa, and leaving it on their
left-rear. Portion of a tribe of natives was met with
near the point of junction between the two streams.
Naked, and although without weapons of any kind,
the savages stood their ground in fearless, open-eyed
astonishment. Sir Thomas Mitchell was impressed with
the serious, intelligent expressions of these blacks, who
though never having before seen white men made no
effort to disguise their feelings, as is usual with such
people. “There was a manly openness of countenance
about them,” wrote Sir Thomas, “which would have
gained my full confidence could we but have understood
each other.” On the 3rd Mount First View was
discovered and named, and five days later Mitchell
ascended Mount Abundance and looked over a magni-
ficent stretch of country, which he called Fitzroy Downs.
The party now was within near proximity to the site
of the present town of Roma.
Mitchell left the course of the river on the 6th,
as it bent to the east. His goal was the north, and
from the lay of distant- ridges he judged that he might
safely depend on falling in with the stream again, if
he maintained his original direction. Several small
branches of the main stream were found to soon dwindle
into mere chains of small pools, and on the 13th the
travellers were crossing the ground dividing the water-
sheds of the Balonne and its tributaries from waters
flowing in what was believed to be a generally north-
westerly direction.
A northerly route was followed, independently of
the course of the creek which had been met with, and
after a few days had elapsed difficulty was experienced
in finding water. But on the 17th Mitchell, who was
examining the country ahead of his party, found the
Maranoa, which he described as being fully as large
as the Darling, with a course lying north to south,
so that by following towards the source the expedition
would be proceeding on its way into the far interior.
However, after proceeding down the stream for a couple
of miles, during which several lately-deserted native
camps were passed, he found a sharp bend, and con-
cluded, as a result of this additional investigation, that
“its final course was an enigma not to be solved with-
out much more research.” Mitchell returned for his


companions, and next day he determined to form a
depot at this supply of permanent water and excellent
pasturage. The leader resolved to wait the arrival of
Kennedy at this well-favoured site, and meanwhile to
explore the neighbouring country.
The district appeared to be fairly-thickly peopled
with natives, calculating as density of population was
counted in the Australian interior, and after the
strangers had occupied their camp for some days the
tribes lost the alarm first felt by them at the presence
of the newcomers. On the 27th Mitchell ascended
Mount Lonsdale, a peak lying due north from the site
of Mungallala, on the Charleville line. The view from
this altitude proved to include an extensive stretch of
country, containing two of the explorer’s fixed points,
one thirty-two and the other forty-two miles distant.
“The land round me,” he wrote, “was fair to look
Soon after they all arrived, the men in excellent health
and the cattle greatly improved in condition. The
only incident of interest they had to relate was a slight
brush with the tribe of natives who had followed and
proved a source of trouble to the advance detachment.
As before, the main object of the savages appeared to be
plunder. On one occasion several of the men had come
to the camp fires of the Europeans and manifested a
strong disinclination to leave, when they were informed
by signs that it was the desire of the strangers that
they should do so. This evidence of contemptuous
familiarity was followed by setting fire to the grass
round the camp of the explorers. Finally, the intruders
were driven off with shouts and shots fired over their
heads. This appears to have been the limit of the
hostility displayed at any time by any of the party.
Mitchell, and those under him, were always able, during
RIVER SALVATOR.
upon; nothing could be finer than the forms of the
hills, half clear of wood, the dispositions of open grassy
downs and vales, or the beauty of the woods. Water
was not wanting; at least, there appeared to be enough
for the present inhabitants, and to an admirer of
Nature there was all that could be desired. Deeply
impressed with its sublime and solitary beauty, I
sketched the scene, and descended from the hill resolved
to follow the river upwards, as more favourable in that
direction to the chief object of ray mission.” Mitchell
had ascertained that the Maranoa came from a direction
slightly north of north-west, and consequently that the
route Ix 3 most desired to travel would be supplied with
water; at any rate, for some considerable distance from
the site of the present depot.
Next day (June 1) a shot fired in the distance
announced the approach of Kennedy and his party.
the whole of their travels, to defend themselves success-
fully without resort to bloodshed or to inflicting injury
on the natives, whose greatest offence seemed to consist
in desire to thieve'—a failing common to nearly all
savages.
Almost immediately on being joined by Kennedy
the leader of the party decided to repeat his late plan,
leaving a depot with the heavier stores and slower of
the transports at a well-chosen spot, and pushing on
with an advance detachment. Both horses and bullocks
were taken with the latter. On this occasion he brought
on supplies of provisions to last for at least four months,
and he increased his party by the addition of Mr.
Stephenson, the surgeon, a man to assist him, and the
shepherd. Portion of the flock of sheep was brought
forward, as by that means food could be conveyed
without being carried. One of the boats, borne in two


hall pieces, was carried on a dray. A start was made
on the 4th, so that no time was lost.
“Every preparation being made,” narrated the
leader, referring to his departure from this second depot,
“1 bade Mr. Kennedy adieu for at least four months,
and crossed the Marauoa with my party and light carts.
It was not without very much regret that I left this
zealous assistant and so large a portion of my men
behind, departing on a hazardous enterprise, as this
was likely to be, where the pojmlation might be more
numerous. Anxiety for the safety of the party let e
predominated with me, for whatever might be the
danger of passing and repassing through these barbarous
legions, that of a party stationary for a length of time
in one place seemed greater, as they were more likely
to be assailed by assembled numbers, and more exjDosed
to their cunning and treachery. I gave to Mr. Ken-
nedy the best advice I could, and we parted in the hope
of a happy meeting at the period of my return—a hope,
I must confess, 1 could not indulge in then with any
degree of pleasure, looking forward to the many diffi-
culties we were prepared to encounter, and considering
the state of my own health.” On the day of departure
they found various traces of coal in the bed of the
Maranoa while crossing that stream.
For the first three weeks Mitchell followed a route
north of north-west, and by the 21st he had reached a
rocky, hilly country, where water was scarce, though
the grass was sufficient to provide feed for the horses
and cattle. However, in places the soil was mostly
loose sand. On the 30th they discovered the Warrego
River, and two days later they found the Salvator,
which contained the first running water found in any
of the streams so far met with in the unknown country.
The water was clear and sparkling and tasted strongly
of sulphur. This was within eighty miles of the tropic.
On July 5 Mount Salvator was named. Mitchell
rightly concluded he had crossed into a new watershed,
but he was over-optimistic in the surmise he drew as to
the final outlet of the stream he was now upon. ‘‘Our
prospects had suddenly brightened,” he wrote, ‘‘when
instead of following chains of dry ponds we had before
us a running stream, carrying life and nourishment
towards the country w r e were about to explore. The
whole aspect of the country seemed new to us. The
barometer showed we were rapidly descending, and I
expected that our living stream would soon join that
greater stream, the basin of which I thought I could
trace in the line of mist seen from Mount P. P. King
on June 28. The course of this river, unlike the others,
curved round from N.W. towards north, and having
origin in mountains equidistant between Cape York and
Wilson Promontory, it was reasonable to suppose that
we had at length crossed the division between the
northern and southern waters. That between the eastern
and western waters was still to be discovered, and in a
country so intricate, and where water was so scarce
then, the course of rivers afforded the readiest means
of determining where that division was. If the general
course of this river were to be the eastward of north, we
might safely conclude that the dividing ground was in
the west or to the left of our route, and this seemed
the more jmobable from the line of a river flowing
north-westward, which I had seen the valley of from
Mount P. P. King.” Mitchell was certainly right in
believing that the stream flowed ultimately eastward of
north, but whatever hopes he had of being able to
approach the Gulf country by following its general
direction were doomed to disappointment. In point of
fact, the spot then occupied was where three water-
sheds nearly join, for a short distance to the north-west
the country slopes into the basin of the Barcoo, a
system soon afterwards to be discovered by Mitchell
himself, and in which the flow is southerly. On follow-
ing the course of the stream the travellers were disap-
pointed at finding that, instead of providing them with
water for an indefinite distance on their way, it emerged
into a lake, which they named Lake Salvator, and the
outlet from which was dry.
Once more they were faced with a scarcity of water,
but after continuing their northern route until the
11th another stream was met with, the Claude River,
flowing from the west. The nature of the country in
this region varied greatly. In places the soil was fertile
and water plentiful, while elsewhere the party passed
over arid, barren ground. On the 13th it was 1,310
feet above sea-level. The Nogoa River, having been
passed some days before, Mitchell, on the 10th, ascended
Mount Mudge, which lies about a degree due west of
the present railway terminus of Springsure. The most
favourable feature to be observed from this eminence
was what appeared to be a watercourse falling either to
to the south-west or north-east. To the westward of the
supposed river a huge, isolated mountain mass shut out
the view of the progress of the stream, if, indeed,
stream it should prove to be. Sir Thomas determined to
shape his further course in that direction, which pre-
sented the lowest point in the horizon. Next day the
party descended into a valley leading north-west, and
after travelling about twelve miles it was found to
contain a fine pond of water, beside which the camp
was pitched for the night. The valley seemed to con-
tinue to the base of the mountain mass viewed from
Mount Mudge, and at the base of which it appeared
to dip into a deeper valley, sloping to either the north-
ward or the southward. The larger mountain was
named Mount Beaufort.
The following day they fell in with the headwaters
of the Belyando River, and Mitchell believed at last
they had come upon a stream flowing to the north-west,


as he had so long desired. Here again he was, of
course, doomed to disappointment, for though the
Belyando reaches far north of where he then was,
it joins the Burdekiu, and thus flows into, not the Gulf
of Carpentaria, but the shores of the Pacific Ocean at
Upstart Bay, some distance to the north of latitude 20°.
The channel, at the point where it was discovered, was
dry when reached by the party, and the surrounding
country was suffering from lack of rain to such an
extent that Sir Thomas remarked he had never seen
vegetation so checked by drought. The grass seemed
parched and useless, and a
continuance of the same sort
of weather was likely to kill
the trees and convert the
region into open downs.
Fortunately, the river bed
contained occasional pools of
water. The tropic was
crossed a few days later.
On the 24th Sir Thomas
wrote: —“There was no hill
or other geographical fea-
ture near the route whereby
it might have been possible
to mark there the limit of
tropical Australia. We were
the first to enter the interior
beyond that line. Three
large kangaroos, hopping
across a small plain, were
visible just as we entered
these regions of the sun.
The air was extremely fra-
grant, the shrubs and grass
being still moist with the
thunder shower. The course
of the river continued fav-
ourable, and the country
seemed to improve as we ad-
vanced, opening into plains
skirted by scrubs of rose-
wood and drooping shrubs,
whose verdure was most refreshing to the eye after just
having passed through dry and withered brigalow. At
eight miles a large lagoon appeared on our left, on
which we saw many ducks, and at nine miles we en-
camped where the grass seemed good, finding water was
at hand now in the river bed.”
Until the middle of August the party followed up
the Belyando. At several places it divided into separate
channels which met again, whilst tributaries joined the
river which the explorers had first discovered. In
places the bed was quite dry, and in others it was

THE SCENE OF MANY EARLY ASSOCIATIONS.
dotted with pools, whilst occasional magnificent reaches
of splendid water, alive with game, and surrounded
with good pastures, provided welcome camping places.
On the 10th an excellent example was afforded of how
bloodshed may be avoided by Europeans when
approached by hostile Australian natives bent on attack.
The incident provides a striking contrast to the out-
come of somewhat similar encounters recorded in the
journals of explorers less courageous and humane than
Sir Thomas Mitchell proved himself whenever meeting
with the original possessors of the wilds. That the
commander was away from
the camp at the time of the
tactfully averting of a con-
flict confers all the more
credit upon his leadership,
showing how thoroughly he
had instilled into his men
his own cool-headed resource-
fulness and respect for the
lives and natural feelings of
the savages who had never
seen white people before.
The story is well worth ren-
dering in Mitchell’s own
words. “The camp,” he
wrote, describing what had
been related to him on his re-
turn from a short ride into
the surrounding country,
“had just been visited by
seventeen natives, apparently
bent on hostile purposes, all
very strong, several of them
upwards of six feet high.
Each of them carried three
or four missile clubs. They
were headed by an old man,
and a gigantic kind of bully
who would not keep his
hands off our carts. They
said, by signs, that the
whole country belonged to
the old man. They pointed in the direction in which
I had gone, and to where Mr. Stephenson happened to
be at the time, down in the river bed, and beckoned to
the party that they should also follow, or go where I had
gone, or leave that place. They were received very
firmly, but civilly and patiently, by the men, and were
requested to sit down at a distance, my man (Brown)
being very desirous that I should return before they
departed, thinking that the old man might have given
me some information about the river, which he called
‘Belyando.’ But a noisy altercation seemed to arise


between the old chief and the tallest man about the
clubs, during which the latter again came forward and
beckoned to others behind him, who also came up. All
carried a club under each arm, and another in each
hand, and from the gestures made to this advanced
party by the rest of a tribe of young men at a distance,
it appeared that this was intended to be a hostile move-
ment. Brown accordingly drew out the men in line
before the tents, with their arms in their hands, and
forbade the natives to approach the tents. 'Nothing
damps the ardour of troops so much,’ says General
Lloyd, ‘as an unexpected obstacle at the moment of
attack,’ and these strong men stood silent and looked
foolish when they saw the five men in line with incom-
prehensible weapons in their hands. Just then our
three dogs ran at them, and no charge of cavalry ever
succeeded better. They all took to their heels, greatly
laughed at, even by the rest of their tribe; and the
only casualty befell the shepherd’s dog, which, biting at
the legs of a native running away, he turned round
and hit the dog so cleverly with his missile on the rump
that it was dangerously ill for months after, the native
having again with great dexterity picked up his club.
The whole of them then disappeared, shouting through
the wood to their gins. It was remarkable that on
seeing the horses they exclaimed ‘Yerraman,’ the colonial
natives’ name for a horse, and that of these animals
they were not at all afraid whereas they seemed in
much dread of the bullocks. That these natives were
fully determined to attack the white strangers seems to
admit of no doubt, and the result is but another of
the many instances that might be adduced that an open
fight without treachery would be contrary to their habits
and disposition. That they did not on any occasion
waylay me or the doctor when detached from the body
of the party may, perhaps, with equal truth be set
down as a favourable trait in the character of the
aborigines, for whenever they visited my camp it was
during my absence, when they knew I was absent, and,
of course, must have known where I was to be found.”
During the following day Sir Thomas Mitchell
altered his plans, having determined that the Belyando
would not take him to the shores of the Gulf or to any
larger stream flowing to those waters. The Belyando,
he concluded, was a tributary to or identical with the
stream which Leichhardt had seen joining the Suttor
in latitude 21° 6'. That the Belyando does join the
Suttor in this region was afterwards established, the
point of junction being approximately that indicated.
In point of fact, Mitchell himself could not have been
a great distance from the Suttor. The channel had
provided the explorers with water across three degrees of
latitude, but it had gradually altered its course from
north-west to about 30° east of north. He had expected to
find high lands lying to the north, and that diverting
the course of the stream to the west; but no such
elevations had appeared, though he had traced it to
21° 30' of latitude. At the latter point the bed of
the river was but little more than 600 feet above sea
level, and from that fact Sir Thomas correctly con-
cluded that the division between the eastern and western
watersheds lay more to the westward. He also reasoned :
“(1) That the river of Carpentaria should have been
sought for to the westward of all the sources of the river
Salvator. (2) That the deepest indentation as yet dis-
covered of the division of the waters was at the sources
of the river, and corresponded with the greatest eleva-
tion indicated by the barometer (about 2,500 feet). And
(3) That there, i.e., under the parallel of 25° S., the
highest spinal range must extend westward, in a line of
truncated cones, whereof Mount Faraday appeared to
be one.” The difference in direction ultimately taken
by the system, including the Claude, the Salvator, and
the Nogoa, from that of the Belyando, does not appear
to have been clearly recognized till some years after
Mitchell’s expedition; and an authority on Australian
exploration as late as William Howitt, in his otherwise
accurate work, “The History of Discovery in Australia,
Tasmania, and New Zealand,” writes of the Claude as
“flowing on to constitute the Belyando,” when in point
of fact the Claude is a tributary of the Nogoa, and
the latter joins the Mackenzie, which, in turn, junction -
ing with the Fitzroy, reaches the sea at Keppel Bay a
few miles north of the tropic.
The programme now decided on by Sir Thomas
Mitchell was to retrace his tracks back to the head of
the Salvator, and from there to explore the country to
the north-west as far as his stock of provisions and the
state of the grass and water of that region would permit.
Since leaving the Culgoa River he had marked the trees
deeply with the number of each camp, cut in Roman
figures. At this farthest point he cut “LXIX.” over
“N.5.W.,” the initials of the Colony, thus indicating
the number of stages between the Culgoa and the ter-
mination of the route. Of course, Sir Thomas felt
keenly disappointed at being forced to postpone his
original intention of penetrating to the north until he
was on some river which he had sufficient grounds for
feeling certain fell into the Gulf of Carpentaria and
made a track to that coast practical for stock to regu-
larly cross with safety. The task he had found by the
route he was then following was too big to be carried
to a success!ul conclusion with the stock of provisions
he had with him. Nearly eight months had already'
elapsed since the party had set out; some hundreds of
miles of weary, and in places difficult, country lay
between them and the nearest settlement, while their
pace could not be any faster than that of the bullocks
on which they were so largely dependent for transport,
and which already had proved to be so monstrously slow.


Possibly they might have pushed forward a few stages
more to the north; but to have persisted in the effort
to establish a route to the Gulf from the point where they
then were, now it had been shown that the Belyando
did not flow that way, would have been stark madness.
By a leader of the sound judgment of Sir Thomas
Mitchell the idea was not to be entertained; and, of
course, a great deal of valuable work had been accom-
plished. The expedition already had been rich in
results of the greatest benefit to the Colony as exercising
a powerfully stimulating effect on pastoral settlement.
"We had,” wrote the leader, "at least laid out a good
any band of hostile savages who might have taken a
fancy to his possessions, but by good luck he did not
suffer any ill from the adventure. Mitchell still hoped
that he might discover the source of a river flowing
north-west to the Gulf, which he intended to attempt
to reach by striking off to the north-west, when he
should have sufficiently retraced his steps along the
Belyando. On the 19th the country was impassable, on
account of the recent rain having softened the clay to
such an extent that the vehicles could not be made to
travel over it. The day was consequently spent by
Mitchell in maturing his plans for penetrating to the
THE PYRAMIDS.
carriage road from the colony to a river in M. Leich-
hardt’s route, which road, as far as we had marked it
with our wheels, led through pastoral regions of much
greater extent than all the colonies now occupied. At
this farthest point traced by our wheels within the tropics
the plants were still known to botanists, but with some
interesting exceptions.”
The party had proceeded far on the southern journey
when they saw evidences of having been followed for a
considerable distance by a tribe of natives. On the
second day the shepherd lost himself together with his
flock, and was not discovered until the next day, when
he was walking diametrically away from the direction
of the party. He would have fallen an easy prey to
westward of the region of the Salvator. Southward
of the high ground of that district, under the parallel
of 24° or 25°, the fall of the water and of the whole
country had been observed to be to the south ; whilst
northward the fall had been so unmistakably in the
opposite direction that the party had been able to follow
the Belyando for three degrees and from a mean eleva-
tion of 2,000 feet to only about 600 feet. No river
of any importance had been seen coming from the west,
and such as had been met with had their origin to
the south-west. From these facts Sir Thomas calcu-
lated that a quite distinct watershed lay not far to the
westward, in which conclusion he was, of course,
correct. Nor was it less reasonable, he argued, to


expect to find there the heads of a river, or rivers, lead-
ing to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The rivers were there,
truly enough, but they led in precisely the opposite
direction to that expected by the explorer, flowing to
the south, and finally losing themselves in lakes and
swamps in the north-eastern corner of South Australia.
On the 24th the party recrossed the line of Capri-
corn, having spent just a month within the tropics,
during which the weather had been favourable and
water abundant. A camp was formed in a peculiarly
fertile district of undulating downs, some ten miles
from the Claude, on the 31st. For the next few days the
party continued travelling through excellent country,
recently refreshed by rain, and bursting into vigorous
life with the budding of spring. Traces of numerous
blacks were seen in places that had been free from inhabi-
tants when the Europeans were on their outward
journey.
On September 4 the party reached a spot where
it was decided to remain for some time whilst Sir
Thomas and a couple of companions set out on the long-
looked-for expedition to explore the western country.
Near by were some remarkable rocky elevations, the
form of which had greatly interested the travellers on
their outward journey. One of these was in the form
of a kind of watch-tower, rising abruptly from the
forest, and at which Sir Thomas said he was obliged to
look attentively in order to convince himself that the
mass of rock was the work of unaided nature. The
locality, being naturally well grassed, and having
recently been burned by the natives, offered sweet feed
for the cattle, whilst Lake Salvator and the Nogoa
River provided ample water.
All the horses being leg-weary, Sir Thomas found
it necessary to spend a few days resting them before
setting off with the freshest. The interval the leader-
spent in writing a copious despatch to the Governor
giving a detailed account of the proceedings and dis-
coveries to be forwarded to that official should any
unfortunate fate overtake the little party that was
about to penetrate the wilderness to the west.
On the 10th Sir Thomas started, taking with him
two white men and Yuranigh, all mounted, and using
two pack-horses, on which were carried sufficient pro-
visions to last for a month. This slender band succeeded
in reaching to within a few miles of where the township
of Isisford now stands, well beyond the 145th degree of
longitude, the distance from the depot at Lake Salvator
being slightly under 240 miles in a straight line, but
more than that by the route followed. On the third
day they reached and named the river Nive. “I verily
believed that this river would run to Carpentaria,” wrote
Sir Thomas, the optimism of whom appeared to be
immortal, so far as capacity for surviving disappoint-
ments w r as concerned. In point of fact the Nive, soon
after leaving its sources, turns nearly due south, a
direction it maintains until falling into the Warrego,
which also keeps that course till passing the present
border of New South Wales. A good season had just
favoured this western country, and Mitchell describes
the grass as exceeding that seen anywhere else in Aus-
tralia in quality and abundance, whilst saltbush was also
found.
The Barcoo, or the Victoria, as it was called by
Mitchell, and by which name it was known until some
years afterwards when confusion with the northern
stream of the same title led to the aboriginal term being
adopted, was discovered on the 15th. In the early
morning the leader of the expedition ascended a high
rock. “I there beheld,” he wrote, “downs and plains
extending westward beyond the reach of vision, bounded
on the south-west by woods and low ranges, and on
the north-east by higher ranges, the whole of these open
downs declining to the north-west, in which direction
a line of trees marked the course of a river traceable to
the remotest verge of the horizon. There I found then,
at last, the realization of my long-cherished hopes—an
interior river falling to the north-west in the heart of
an open country extending also in that direction.
Ulloa’s delight at the first view of the Pacific could not
have surpassed mine on this occasion, nor could the
fervour with which he was impressed at the moment
have exceeded my sense of gratitude for being allowed
to make the discovery. From that rock the scene was
so extensive as to leave no room for doubt as to the
course of the river which, thus and there revealed to
me alone, seemed like a reward direct from heaven for
perseverance, and as a compensation for the many sacri-
fices I had made in order to solve the question as to
the interior rivers of tropical Australia.”
The blacks were plentiful along the course of the
river, but no trouble from them was experienced by the
explorers, who found safety in the rapidity of their
movements. Moreover, signs were ample of the natives
entertaining great fear of the travellers and their
mysterious weapons, but more particularly of the
remarkable quadrupeds which they rode, and which
exceeded in size any living creature ever seen by the
inhabitants of that grassy wilderness where the biggest
of all animals were the old-man kangaroos. For many
days the direction of the river was consistently to the
north-west, and the hopes of Sir Thomas Mitchell rose
high. Throughout the whole distance the little party
passed over the same luxuriant pastures. In
places the channel of the river was dry, but no
long tracts had to be covered without drink for


man or beast, as bad been the experience in
other regions. Tributaries to the main river
were found; and on the 21st Mitchell noted a
greater tendency westward on the part of the latter.
On that day they passed some large huts built by the
aborigines near the river. These were of more elaborate
plan and substantial construction than were to be found
in the dwellings of the natives in the south. A frame,
resembling a lean-to roof, had been erected first.
Rafters were laid on that, whilst on the latter rect-
angular pieces of bark were placed in the position of
tiles. Next day the riders came upon a point where
the several channels into which the river had divided
joined together, and had formed “the broad, deep, and
village the nomadic Australian natives ever construct.
The huts were large, permanent, and plentiful, whilst
well-beaten paths led to and from them. This was clearly
the home of a large tribe. The people Mitchell and his
companions would gladly have avoided meeting, but it
was necessary for the Europeans to keep near the river,
which was the most likely place to come upon the
natives. The party had not ridden far before “loud
shrieks of many women and children and the angry
voices of men” demonstrated that the tribe had been
overtaken. The temper of the aborigines was by no
means improved by being taken unawares. With
horses jaded, and desiring nothing less than a conflict,
Mitchell took no notice of words yelled at him which

placid waters of a river as large as the Murray.” Great
quantities of pelicans and ducks were floating here on
what formed an extensive feeding place, and the banks
were covered with mussel shells of enormous size.
On the 23rd the Alice was discovered flowing in
from the north-east. Mitchell correctly surmised that
this new stream would turn the main stream off to the
west or south, and he thereupon resolved to turn home-
wards. The Barcoo not only turns to the south-west
at that point, but it never again resumes a northerly
position.
On the 25th the travellers came upon a large lagoon,
beside which was the nearest approach to a permanent
K
were interpreted as meaning “What do you want ?” but
adhered rigidly to his original course. Two of his men,
riding some little distance behind their leader, noticed
two blacks, armed with spears and clubs, ambush them-
selves behind a bush beside which the white commander
would pass unless deflecting his course. When the white
men halted the would-be assailants made off.
During the eastward journey the country was found
to be suffering from lack of rain, and some of the water-
holes which had supplied the requirements of the camps
on the way out were dry when depended on at the.
later visit. Thus the night of October 1 passed without
drink for men or horses, though it was spent beside a


pond which had served to quench the thirst of them all
on September 17. Since those regions have been
permanently settled droughts have occurred with
such severity that hardly a vestige of living vegetation
has remained, the years 1902 and 1915 being cases in
point. On the sth the party came upon what was
strangely the first snake they had seen in their northern
travels. Sir Thomas and Yuranigh both tried to kill
the reptile with sticks, and both missed, when they were
very much surprised by the creature turning on them.
With head erect it glided nimbly towards the horses
and the rest of the party. It touched the fetlock of
one of the forefeet of the leader’s horse with its head,
but without biting. Then it did the same to the hind
fetlock. From the horse, which stood quietly, it darted
towards one of the men, when he was in the act of
throwing a stick at it, and as he managed to elude the
attack it made for Yuranigh, but at that moment
received a charge of small shot in its body. The reptile
was brown, with red spots on the belly, about six feet
long and five inches in circumference. Mitchell says
this was the only occasion on which he knew a snake
to attack a party, and most bushmen would agree as to
the experience being exceedingly rare. At this stage
the party were suffering considerable privation from the
provisions having almost given out. Emus were plen-
tiful, and at times considerable numbers of kangaroos
were seen, but both were difficult to approach within
shooting distance.
About sunset on the 6th they reached the depot
where Stephenson had remained. The cattle which had
been left had benefited greatly by the rest, being in
excellent condition for travelling, whilst the whole party
were in good health and spirits. The combined forces
found they had enough provisions between them for all
hands until Kennedy should be reached at the more
remote camp on the long homeward journey. Several'
days’ spell was needed by the horses, which had just
completed the expedition to the Alice River. During
the absence of the leader Stephenson had not been
visited by the blacks, nor had he been faced with any
difficulties.
Three days were spent by Mitchell in taking short
rides into the surrounding country and collecting data
of interest to botanists and zoologists. On the 10th a
start was made along the old route to the south. What
in an expedition led by Mitchell was the rare incident
of an accident, resulting in the loss of a horse, occurred
on the 17th, when one man leading four horses, con-
trary to instructions, was close to the precipitous bank
of a river channel. One animal kicked at another, and
the latter, losing foothold, fell a clear forty feet, and,
being unable to rise, had to be shot for humane reasons.
The expedition had been almost free from mishap, such
was the care and skill evidenced throughout by Sir
Thomas’ management.
Next day the travellers reached Mr. Kennedy’s
depot, were the party were found to be in good health.
The four months and fifteen days during which the
leader and his companions had been away had not been
spent in idleness. A stockyard had been constructed, a
storehouse erected, and a garden fenced in and planted
with lettuce, radishes, melons, and cucumbers. The
camp had the appearance of a permanent settlement,
and, in the words of Mitchell, “evinced the good effects
of order and discipline.” Many specimens of birds and
plants had been collected by Drysdale, the storekeeper;
while excellent care had been taken of the stores.
Several interviews had been held with the natives of
the locality. On the occasion of one of these an effort
was made to decoy away Dicky, a blackboy belonging
to Kennedy’s party. The journal of the latter gives
the following interesting account of the incident, and
contains an illuminating instance of the cunning of the
natives:—“Sunday, July 26, prayers were read at 11
a.m., after which, having been told by Drysdale that
the natives were still near the camp, and that there
was a native among them who could make himself
more intelligible to Dicky than the rest, I started down
the river to see them to collect what information I
could, and then induce them to go farther from the
camp. I had not gone far before the cooees from the
tents made me aware that the natives were by
this time in sight. I therefore returned, and the first
object that caught my eye was the bait —a gin, dancing
before some admiring spectators; and behind her was
a fine, lusty native advancing by great strides, as he
considered the graceful movements of his gin were gain-
ing fast upon the hearts of the white men. On going
up to him Dicky put the usual question as to the name
of the river and its general course. His reply to the
first was not very satisfactory, but our impression was
that he called it Baiun. With respect to its course, he
plainly said that it joined the Balonne, repeatedly
pointing in the direction of the river and then following
with his hand the various windings of this branch,
repeating the while some word implying ‘walk, walk,’
and ending with ‘Balonne.’ He knew the names of the
mountains Bindango and Bindyego. After his conver-
sation he took some fat, which he appeared to have
brought for the purpose, and anointed Dicky by chew-
ing it and then spitting upon his head and face. He
next whispered to him, and (as Dicky says) invited him
to join them. I then motioned to the men, who were
looking on at a short distance, to go to the camp; and,
as they obeyed, I made signs to the native to move in
the opposite direction, which he at length did with


evident reluctance and disappointment, throwing away
his green bough and continually looking back as he
retired. I desired Dicky to tell him never to come near
our tents and that no white man should go to his.”
Sir Thomas Mitchell found he would need to spend
some days at the depot before pushing on towards civi-
lized localities. The carts required repairing and the
horses shoeing. As usual, the leader put the intervening
time to good us© in gathering information about the
natural features of the country and in collecting fossils,
specimens of new plants, and other data which would
add to the total of discoveries resulting from the general
enterprise. The party moved off on the 22nd, the cattle
and horses thus having benefited by three clear days of
rest. Rarely did an expedition which had penetrated
so far into unknown country and achieved results so
valuable begin the final stages on the homeward route
in such excellent conditions. The men were well, whilst
on the first day time was lost because of the oxen being
too fat for more than the slowest of paces. Big things
had been accomplished with a minimum of financial loss
and as little as possible of privation to the explorers.
The party made their way southward by the rivers
Maranoa and Balonne, meeting with no obstacles of con-
sequence till the end of November, when their progress
for upwards of a fortnight was completely suspended on
account of continued heavy rains, which commenced on
the 21st. Corporal Graham had previously been sent
on ahead with despatches for the Governor, which he
was to deliver at the Post Office at Tamworth, in New
South Wales. On the 15th the party passed within a
day’s ride of stations lately established by Messrs. Hook
and others. These were discovered by Kennedy, who
had ridden out with Douglas reconnoitring, and was
considerably convenienced by being lent a horse by the
squatters just named. The explorers were returning by
their own outward route, and by the middle of the
month numerous tracks of horses and cattle showed that
pastoralists were already pushing out into regions which
Sir Thomas Mitchell and his companions had been the
first white men to see. On the 19th the sight of a
white woman setting out to milk a cow caused hilarious
amusement to the blackboy Dicky, who never before
had seen what appeared to him to be the quaint costume
of a European female.
For some days the party were almost surrounded
by water, and as hot weather both preceded and fol-
lowed the downpour, great inconvenience was suffered on
account of the quantities of mosquitoes which swarmed
round the men in dense clouds. However, on the 9th
the conditions had so far improved that the party were
able to cross the Barwon. This was accomplished by
taking the remains of the stores over the water by boats,
which were put together for that purpose for the last
time during the expedition, and by swimming the stock
k 2
across, whilst the empty drays were drawn through the
channel at a favourable spot. Mitchell, in commenting
on this experience, incidentally regretted that he “had
not reached the navigable portion of the Victoria and
that its channel had been so empty.” lie remarked
that perhaps more efficient portable boats were never
constructed or carried so far inland undamaged. The
country between the Barwon and the Gwydir was found
to be unoccupied and free even from tracks of cattle.
The latter stream was crossed a couple of days later,
and the first of regions, which might fairly be considered
as permanently settled, was thus entered upon.
In this manner ended a splendidly successful expe-
dition, which had lasted just a day more than the
twelve months —the period for which arrangements had
been made. The main purpose—that of finding a route
to the north coast —had not been accomplished. Indeed,
in that resjxect, the result had been more disappointing
than the leader believed to be the case. The import-
ance of the Barcoo, or Victoria (as its discoverer had
named it) River had been exaggerated by him.
Only by following down the course of that stream could
anyone ascertain that its destination was but great
inland swamps, called lakes rather by courtesy than by
reason of accuracy. Yet the results of the enterprise
were rich in practical value to l the growing Colony of
New South Wales. A wealth of new information had
been collected on the nature of the great interior, and
this, coupled with the result of a subsequent enterprise,
brought the country found by Mitchell into occupation
and under the use for which he had declared it to be
suitable.
Sir Thomas Mitchell was not only a courageous and
a painstaking explorer of unknown wilds, but he was
also a keen judge of the usefulness of the regions into
which he was the first to penetrate. Endowed with great
physical endurance as well as with an unusual degree
of determination, he also was of a scientific type of
mind, having a natural gift for weighing the value of
data and viewing evidence in proper proportion. It is
true that the favourable picture he painted of the
interior of Central Queensland has not always been
verified by subsequent experience; but so varying is the
character of the pasturage and general suitableness of
that territory for pastoral enterprise that no explorer
could possibly have formed an opinion of its real value
which would have remained true during all the fluctu-
ating years of subsequent experience. In the main, Sir
Thomas Mitchell’s impressions have turned out to be
surprisingly accurate, and, on the whole, it was more
in the interest of the Colony at that stage of its growth
that settlers should have been encouraged to push their
enterprise to the north than that a damper should have
been flung on the prospects awaiting pastoral settlement
in that direction.


On the recommendation of Sir Thomas the Governor
granted gratuities to certain members of the expedition.
He also sent to the Imperial Government the names of
such of the convicts of the party as he thought had
rendered themselves deserving of pardon. The cattle
and equipment brought back to civilization were sold
for £5OO, a sum devoted to fitting out a subsequent en-
terprise, of which the following chapter gives an account.
CHAPTER XII.
EXPEDITIONS OF EDMUND B. KENNEDY.
The immediate result of the report furnished by
Sir Thomas Mitchell of his journeys to the interior of
tropical Queensland, as might be guessed, was to stimu-
late the interest of both the public and the Government
in the further investigations of those regions. No one
feeling responsibility as to the growth of the Colony
was likely to rest content with the meagre knowledge
then to hand on the “most important river in Aus-
tralia,” and “the downs and plains through which it
flowed, sufficient to supply the whole Avorld with animal
food.” Sir Thomas still believed the waters of the
interior to the north of the Darling to flow in a north-
west direction through a fertile and well-favoured
country, and opening a way to the shores of the Gulf
of Carpentaria. This conviction was strong in his mind
before he had set out on his recent excursion, and the
course of the Barcoo he had found lying in the direction
he had expected. True, that stream had turned to
the south-west at the point where he had been forced
to leave it; but there was no evidence to show that the
original direction had not been resumed soon after.
Sir Charles Fitzroy had become Governor of New
South Wales during the absence of Sir Thomas Mitchell
and his companions. The explorer did not experience
difficulty in enlisting the support of that officer
in assisting to send a small party to further
investigate the course of the Barcoo. Mr. Edmund
Kennedy, who held the position of Assistant Govern-
ment Surveyor, offered his services as leader of this
enterprise. The scheme was adopted and Kennedy’s
offer accepted. The .£5OO obtained from the cattle and
equipment brought back by Sir Thomas was used in
fitting out the expedition. The selection of the com-
mander was wise, for not only was Kennedy a young
and capable leader, but the knowledge of the special
task in hand which he had gained while with Mitchell,
gave him advantages it was impossible for anyone who
had not taken part in that journey to possess.
Edmund Kennedy consequently set out in the middle
of March with eight well-mounted men, spare horses,
two light carts, and sufficient provisions to last for
eight months. Kennedy hoped to make more rapid
progress than had been his experience when previously
travelling in the same direction, for on the former
occasion time undoubtedly had been lost by bullocks
being used instead of horses for draught purposes.
Moreover, he did not take sheep with him. Ultimate
experience of this and other exploring enterprises have
demonstrated the strength and safety of small mobile
parties, providing they had with them sufficient sup-
plies of food, as against cumbersome and slow caval-
cades, such as that which Burke and Wills led to
disaster. Even with the light equipment he had, Ken-
nedy was obliged to bury a portion of his belongings on
two occasions, and could take the carts only part of the
way with him. As it was, he was able to trace the
Barcoo in its southern course sufficiently beyond where
Windorah now stands to convince himself that he was
on but the upper channel of Coopers Creek. With
bullocks or a heavier equipment it is unlikely he could
have travelled nearly so far over the difficult surface
which the ground offered for long distances of the way.
The plan which Kennedy set out to accomplish is
best described in the instructions given him by Sir
Thomas Mitchell, the latter acting in his capacity as
Surveyor-General, and of which the following is a
copy :
“Sir—His Excellency the Governor having been
pleased to sanction my proposal for the further explora-
tion of the river Victoria with a small party to be
sent under your command, I have now the honour to
enclose to you a copy of instructions by which I was
guided in conducting the late expedition into the
northern interior, and I have to request that you will
conform thereto as much as the following particular
instructions for your especial guidance may permit.
You will as early as possible return by the road across
Liverpool Plains, so as to fall into the return route
of the late expedition before you leave the settled dis-
tricts, and in this manner you will recross the Balonne
at St. George Bridge, take the route back to Camp 83,
and thence by the route along the Maranoa to Camp
XXIX., beyond which you will proceed as hereinafter
detailed, with reference to the accompanying tracing


of my survey. You will cross the Maranoa at Camp
XXIX., and continue along my return route until you
reach Camp 75. I beg you will be particular so far
in looking for the track of my party returning, as you
will perceive by the map that many very circuitous
detours may be thus avoided. But beyond Camp 75,
about seven miles, you will have to leave my return
track on your right, and not cross a little river there
at all, but go along my old advance track to Camp
XXXIV. Thence you will proceed by Camps XXXV.
and XXXVI. in order to approach the bed of the
Warrego in the direction of my ride of June 14 in a
general north-west direction. It is very desirable that
you should keep my horse-track there; but this I can
scarcely expect, and I can
only therefore request that
you will proceed as closely
in that direction as you can.
The bed of the Warrego may
be looked for at a distance
further on, equal to that of
my ride on June 14. You
will next pursue the course
of the Warrego upwards
towards Mount Playfair,
which the accompanying
map will be sufficient to
guide you to. You will fol-
low up the Cunno Creek,
leaving Mount Playfair on
your right or to the east-
ward, and you will thus fall
into the line of my horse-
track about the spot where
I spoke to an old native
female. I wish you would
then take some pains to travel
in the direction of my track
from the head of the Cunno
through the Brigalow, which
is comparatively open, in
the direction of my bivouac
of September 11. Keeping the direction of my track of
next day, you will arrive at a low but stony ridge,
across which you must be careful how you pass youi
carts; but it is of no breadth, and you will descend into
a flat from which you will ascend another stony ridge
(B), of no greater height but more asperity than the
first, and covered with fallen timber. You will have
about a mile of that sort of difficulty to deal with on
the higher part, but by turning then to the right you
will fall into a well-watered valley, which will lead you
to the Nive. In the whole of your route thus far you
can meet with no difficulty in tracing it, guided by
the map and following these instructions; but if Douglas
should be with you, lie will no doubt recognize the
country through which he passed with me. It is very
important that you should keep that route, as leading
to the Victoria in a very straight direction from Sydney,
and a direction in which, should your return be delayed
beyond the time for which your party is to be pro-
visioned, it is probable that any party sent after you
to your aid or assistance would proceed to look for you.
After you shall have reached the Nive and Camp 77,
you cannot have any difficulty in finding Camp 72 near
the Gap, and from that valley you have only to follow
down the watercourses to be certain that you are on
my track to the Victoria, and, as you have been
instructed to take an expert native with you, you
ought to find my horse’s
tracks across the downs cut-
ting off large bends of the
river. But beyond Camps
September 16 or October 1
you must keep by tire river
along my route back, and
not follow the circuitous
track which I took through
Brigalow to the westward.
After about four miles by
the river you will see by
the map that my return
track again crossed the out-
ward track over the Downs,
so that you may fall into
the route westward of the
great northern bend of the
Victoria. I fear that you
must depend upon the lati-
tude, pace measurements and
bearings for ascertaining
tire situations of my camps
of September 29 and Septem-
ber 28. You will see by the
map how generally straight
my journeys were between
these points, and how
important it would be for you to know the situation
of the camp of September 28, that you may thence set
out westward in the direction of my return route,
instead of following the main channel throughout the
very circuitous turn it then takes to the northward.
Beyond the lowest point attained by me, or the point
(wherever that may be) to which you will be able to
identify the accompanying map with my track, of course
it will be your duty to pursue the river and determine
the course thereof as accurately as your light equipment
and consequent rapid progress may permit. You may,
however, employ the same means by which I have
mapped that river so far, and for your guidance I shall

add the particulars of my method of measuring the
relative distances. If you count the strokes of either of
your horse’s forefeet, either walking or trotting, you
will find them to be upon an average about 950 to a
mile. In a field-book, as you note each change of bear-
ing, you have only to note down also the number of
paces (which soon becomes a habit), and to keep count
of these it is only necessary to carry about thirty-five
or forty small pieces of wood, like dice (beans or peas
would do), in one waistcoat pocket, and at the end
of every 100 paces remove one to the empty pocket on
the opposite side. At each change of bearing you
count these, adding odd numbers to the number of
hundreds, ascertained by the dice, to be counted and
returned at each change of bearing to the other pocket.
You should have a higher pocket for your watch, and
keep the two lower waistcoat pockets for this important-
purpose. Now, to plot such a survey, you have only
to take the half-inch scale of equal parts (on the 6-inch
scale in every case of instruments), and allowing ten
for a hundred, the half-inch will rejiresent 1,000 paces.
You may thus lay down any broken number of paces
to a true scale, and so obtain a tolerably accurate map
of each day’s journey. The latitude will, after all,
determine finally the scale of paces, and you can at
leisure adjust each day’s journey by its general bearing
between different latitudes, and subsequently introduce
the details. You will soon find the results sufficiently
accurate to afford some criterion of even the variation
of the needle, when the course happens to be nearly
east or west, and when, of course, it behoves you to
be very well acquainted with the rate of your horse’s
paces, as determined by differences of latitude. You
will be careful to intersect the prominent points of any
range that may appear on the horizon, and the nature
of the rock also should be ascertained in the country
examined; small specimens, with letters of reference,
will be sufficient for this. Specimens of the grasses and
of the flower or seed of new trees should be also pre-
served, with dates, in a small herbarium. But the
principal object of the journey being the determination
of the course of the Victoria and the discovery of a
convenient route to the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
the accomplishment of these great objects must be
steadily kept in view, without regard to minor con-
siderations. Should the channel finally spread into an
extensive bed, whether dry or swampy, you will adhere,
as a general rule, to the eastern side or shore, as in the
event of any scarcity of water the high land known to
be there will thus be more speedily accessible to you,
and I am also strongly of opinion that you would cross
in such a route more tributaries from the east than
from the west. On arriving at or near the Gulf of
Carpentaria I have particularly to caution you against
remaining longer than may be unavoidable there, or,
indeed, in any one place in any part of your route
where natives may be numerous. I laving completed (at
least roughly) the map of your general route, it will
be in your jiower in x’eturning to take out detours and
cut off angles by previously ascertaining the proper
bearings for doing so, and when so returning it would
be convenient to number your camps, that the route
and the country may be much better described by you
and recognized afterwards by others. These numbers
may be cut in common figures on trees, and if, as 1
hope, you should reach the Gulf, you can commence
them there; you may prefix ‘C’ to each number com-
mencing with 'l/ thus avoiding any confusion with the
numbers of my numbered camps on the Victoria. On
returning to the colony you will report to me or to the
officer in charge of the Survey Department the progress
and results of your journey.
“I have the honour to be, Sir,
“Your obedient servant,
“T. L. Mitchell, Surveyor-General.
“E. B. C. Kennedy, Esq., J.P.,
“Assistant Surveyor-General, Sydney.”
The junction of the Alice and the Barcoo, which
had been the farthest point attained by Sir Thomas
Mitchell, was reached by Kennedy on August 13.
Crossing to the right, or north-west bank, the party
followed the channel through grassy plains, though the
other side they could see to be covered with scrub.
Before they had proceeded very far they found that
the river divided into three channels, two of which con-
tained water only occasionally. As the explorers
continued their journey the hope of the stream turning
in a direction which might lead to the Continent’s
northern coast grew progressively less. The country was
so flat that the channel kept separating into branches
and joining again. For some time after leaving
Mitchell’s last canqi permanent water was always found
in one of these branches, but later they were all dry,
and need of water presented an increasing difficulty.
When near the present site of Welford, Kennedy be-
came convinced that the stream he was following would
be unlikely to lead him to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
that he would be unable, with the equipment and
provisions he had on hand, to both reach those shores
and determine where the river flowed to. He therefore
resolved to pursue the latter object and to abandon the
hope of attaining to the northern coast. The scheme
he mapped out for himself then was that after having
traced the channel for nearly a hundred miles in a
south-south-west direction with his whole party, he
should make a hurried dash with two men as far south
as latitude 26°, after which he should follow the Barcoo
northward towards its source, and in that way continue
Mitchell s route towards the Gulf. Tn pursuance of
this plan he set out with two companions on


August 20, leaving the remainder of his people encamped
at a suitable spot.
After riding only about twelve miles the explorers
found that a junction of several channels made a
magnificent reach of water, just below which the stream
tcok a bend in a considerably more westerly direction.
Some distance further on the river turned still more to
the west, and for the next thirty miles a succession of
fine reaches, from eighty to a hundred and twenty
yards wide, removed all source of anxiety on the score
of water supplies. However, the plains over which they
rode were poor and barren. Some of the reaches were
judged to be never dry, as they were protected from
being emptied by evaporation by their considerable
depth. The next point of
interest to be met with was
the junction of the Thomson
River, coming from a direc-
tion slightly east of north.
Kennedy named the stream
after the Hon. E. Deas-
Thomson, who was the Col-
onial Secretary. The com-
bined stream at this point
turned more to the south-
ward .
The ground here be-
came very heavy for travel-
ling upon, and it soon grew
apparent that the party
would have to lighten their
load. Consequently, in
latitude 25° 24' some of
the provisions were bur-
ied, fires being burned
over the spot, as it was
hoped that by such means
the fact of the soil hav-
ing been disturbed would
not be noticed by the
natives, who would thus
be prevented from stealing
the food which might be so urgently required by the
travellers. This plan had been adopted originally by
Leichhardt. Sufficient provisions were retained to last
for a period considered adequate to enable the party to
reach the furthest point on Coopers Creek attained by
Captain Sturt. Unfortunately, the ground grew more
difficult to cross as the explorers continued their journey.
The horses were in continual danger of breaking their
legs in deep cracks in the soil, and became much
fatigued by stumbling through these natural traps.
Later the river turned to the westward, a barren ridge
of sandstone, hardly rising to the dignity of a range,
lying on the opposite bank. The several channels again
united and formed another fine reach. This was the
second of such poverty-stricken elevations which had
diverted the course of the stream, the first having been
in latitude 25° 7'. A further lot of provisions had to
be left buried here. As they jirogressed the country
grew more barren and water more scanty. The party
followed the river to latitude 26° 13' 9”, longitude
142° 20'. Here the stream had cut several channels,
all trending south, whilst a low range, which bounded
the flat country on the east side, was seen to be bearing
25° east. Sturt had abandoned Coopers Creek in lati-
tude 27° 46' and longitude 141° 51'. These facts now
thoroughly convinced Kennedy that he was following
the upper portion of the latter stream, and he conse-
quently resolved to turn
back.
An unpleasant surprise
awaited the explorers at
the spot where the
main part of the stores
had been hidden. The
natives had been shrewder
at reading natural signs
than they had been given
credit for. From appear-
ances the surface of the
ground looked as though
it had not been tam-
pered with for the soil
was covered with undis-
turbed ashes, but a little
work at digging soon
showed that most of the pro-
visions had gone. At first
this was thought to be the
work of rats, but soon it was
seen that theft had been
committed by the natives.
Some of the things had been
taken away and others were
left, though the latter
were now destroyed. Tar-
paulin and bags, in which such commodities as tea and
sugar had been packed, were taken away, whilst the
tea and sugar were poured back into the hole with
some straw. Earth was filled in on top and a fire was
made over the spot, so that only by careful examination
could the theft be discovered. The loss unfortunately
affected the result of the expedition, for it
prevented Kennedy carrying out his project of seriously
endeavouring to reach the shores of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria,
There was now no way open to the party but to
pursue their course homewards. Mitchell’s dream of a
magnificent river flowing through a splendidly fertile

country, leading probably to the northern coast and
navigable for jiart of its way, had been rudely shattered.
“The most important river in Australia’’ had dwindled
into a chain o : waterholes, afterwards turning into a
creek, along which there is a current only at rare
intervals, and losing itself in desert sands. The latter
explorer had been forced to return, not when on the
edge of a magnificently fertile province, as large as a
kingdom and as prolific as the well-favoured southern
regions, but when approaching an arid wilderness.
Perhaps never did the wanderer through an unknown
territory follow so elusive a will-o’-the-wisp, thinking lie
was being led to a land of peace and plenty, as
the parties Sir Thomas and Kennedy had commanded
in searching for the stream to the Gulf. To have
counteracted the optimistic descriptions given by
Mitchell of the interior was a useful achievement to
have accomplished. Sir Thomas had seen one side of
the picture. In the interests of the success of pastoral
development, and those embarking upon it with their
capital, it was very necessary that someone should view
the opposite side of the landscape. Kennedy had cer-
tainly justified his expedition.
The homeward journey was rendered none the more
pleasant by a tribe of natives, who followed on the heels
of the party for days and displayed a readiness to- adopt
open hostilities, which on one occasion went so far as to
bring a boomerang whirling near Mr. Kennedy’s head.
A serious conflict was averted with difficulty, but ulti-
mately the blacks discontinued their unwelcome atten-
tions, apparently having arrived at the boundary of the
territory which, according to aboriginal custom, was
regarded as theirs, so that had they continued in the
rear of the Europeans they would have brought upon
themselves at the hands of another dusky band a form
of retaliation much less restrained than had been the
feelings of annoyance they had engendered in the hearts
of the mounted strangers. Had Kennedy’s horses been
fresher this kind of danger would not have existed, for
the savages could not have kept pace with rapidly-
travelling horsemen making along any fairly definite
and straight route. It was because he anticipated that
kind of menace —a possibility Mitchell always kept on
his guard to avoid, so far as was possible—that Sir
Thomas had warned Kennedy, in his instructions to the
latter, to refrain from lingering in any locality. This
old hand at exploration knew that with maintained
mobility there was little to fear from natives, for as soon
as a tribe had been thoroughly aware of the presence
of the white strangers the latter would have moved to
a point far beyond their reach.
On the outward route it had been found impossible
to take the carts beyond a comparatively early stage,
and consequently they had been buried in the same way
as had been the provisions at a later date. This locality
was reached again on October 7, when it was found that
the blacks had been sounding the ground, and doubtless
iu a little while would have discoveied and taken
possession of the plant. The rest of the journey was
completed without notable incident, the party passing
by Mount Playfair, and then crossing the Warrego
and following down the Maranoa and Culgoa to the
Barwon, Sydney being reached without mishap and with
all the members of the expedition in good health.
Kennedy did not Jong remain iu the haunts of
civilization. Soon after his return he was appointed
to the command of an expedition which it was intended
would complete the work commenced by Sir Thomas
Mitchell by linking up from the north. The new enter-
prise was to be put in hand early in 1848, so that the
preparations he had to make left the energetic young
explorer so little time as to compel him to leave the
completion of his former journal to the Rev. W. B.
Clarke, the geologist, whose name has passed, into
history as one of the first discoverers of gold in
Australia.
An effect of the recent discoveries of Kennedy had
been to turn attention to the coastal rather than to the
western regions for a practical route to the Gulf of
Carpentaria. It was clear that the Barcoo did not lead
in that direction, and that the further west one went
from the northern country already known the more
arid and difficult became the conditions. The next
scheme attempted was, therefore, the investigation of
the coastal belt from latitude 18° to the Cape York
Peninsula. Little was known about the interior of that
promising region, and the prospect of its exploration was
filled with interest and hope. Yet no expedition of Aus-
tralian inland exploration, excepting only Leichhardt’s
fatal march to annihilation, has met so tragic a fate as
that which overtook the party of 1848, when out of
thirteen only three were spared to return to civilization.
After the partial failure of the expedition just
before led by him to the Barcoo, Kennedy eagerly
accepted the offer of the command of the enterprise to
the northern extremity of Eastern Australia. The
task facing him was of more than ordinary difficulty and
danger; but those considerations did not weigh in the
calculations of the young surveyor, who had set his heart
on completing the work so splendidly commenced by his
late leader, Sir Thomas Mitchell. No time was lost in
the completion of the necessary preparations. The
jiroblems to be faced soon began to manifest themselves.
Had Kennedy been about to explore the arid interior
he could not have done better than to have followed
the example set by Mitchell, or indeed to have repeated
his own plans of a year earlier. But the task on hand


differed materially from that on which he had been
engaged, first as lieutenant to the Surveyor-General and
afterwards as commander. Thirst and starvation were
the ever-present perils facing the traveller who should
penetrate too far into the dead heart of the Continent.
To a quickly-moving party the danger from attacks by
natives in those regions was comparatively easily
guarded against; but the tropical coastal districts were
likely to be much more densely populated, whilst
evidences went to show that the savages inhabiting that
part of the Continent were bolder, more warlike, and
more numerous. Moreover, the broken nature of the
The plan with which Kennedy set out was to travel
by sea to Rockingham Bay. Erom there the party were
to travel overland to Princess Charlotte Bay, in latitude
14°, and then to Cape York, at the extremity of the
peninsula. Four months after the departure of the
expedition a ship was to leave Sydney with a further
stock of provisions, and Kennedy and his companions were
to meet this at Port Albany, near Cape York. The
latter were then to proceed south along the eastern
shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria to investigate what was
thought to be the estuary of the Mitchell River, dis-
covered inland by Leichhardt, but not followed to the

country rendered fast travelling less practicable. Heavy
forests were likely to take the place of open plains, and
rugged ranges the place of hundreds of miles of country
so flat that it was often difficult to tell which way the
water fell. The party appointed to accompany Ken-
nedy consisted of a dozen men, besides the leader. There
were to be taken twenty-eight horses and one hundred
sheep, besides flour, tea, sugar, and other provisions. An
ample supply of arms was included in the equipment.
These included eight carbines, thirteen pairs of pistols,
four guns and one rifle.
sea by that explorer, and, if finding that the opening
believed to be the mouth of that stream was really its
outlet, to trace the stream to its junction with the
Lynd, about halfway across the neck of the peninsula.
From that point the party were to travel in a west-
south-westerly direction until reaching the Flinders,
which was to be followed to its source. Then the jour-
ney was to be linked up with Mitchell’s route of 1846 by
following the Belyando River, or any other convenient
route which happened to offer. The party were then to
return to Sydney. No body of men ever set out into


t he north-eastern corner of the Continent with a more
comprehensive or ambitious programme before it.
Rockingham Bay was reached on May 21, 1848,
and the overland journey was commenced on .June 1.
Difficulties were met with immediately, and they proved
ot a character of which Kennedy had received no experi-
ence in his previous expeditions. Rugged ranges rose
from near the coast to heights of up to 2,000 feet, and
the surface of the ground proved so precipitous and
rocky that the carts and heavier portion of the stores
had to be abandoned, and the party were forced to travel
south-west before they could assume their desired direc-
tion to the north. This depletion of the equipment
rendered Cape York unattainable for the whole party
without aid being obtained. Kennedy therefore re-
solved to leave eight men at Weymouth Bay, about 100
miles, as the crow flies, south of Cape York —whilst he,
with four men, including Jacky, the native guide, should
reach Port Albany and send round the ship which would
be waiting there with supplies, or a boat to enable them
to complete that part of the journey by water. How-
ever, the explorers were still a long way south of
Princess Charlotte Bay, which is south of Weymouth
Bay. In order to reach the former they were forced
by the rough character of the ground to penetrate inland
sufficiently far to cross on to the eastern watershed.
After passing the heads of some of the tributaries of the
Mitchell River, they reached a stream flowing north,
and by following it down they found the latter emptied
into Princess Charlotte Bay. The river they followed was
afterwards called the Kennedy in its upper portion and
the Normanby in the lower.
The plan of leaving eight of the party at Weymouth
Bay was adhered to, and the division of forces was made
on November 10. When leaving the main body of his
people, the leader struck off to the north, accompanied
by three white men and the aboriginal guide. Here
began a tale of horrible suffering and tragic failure.
Kennedy did not know how bloodthirsty were the savages
into whose native forests he was about to penetrate.
Many years before Captain Cook had discovered the
treacherous and warlike character of the natives of the
peninsula, when his vessel had been laid up at Endeav-
our River. However, even had he known more of the
dangers into which he was plunging, Kennedy would
have found little choice of action open to him. And
had a simple accident not occurred to one of his com-
panions the whole of the subsequent chapter of disasters
might have been averted. But as it was, one of Ken-
nedy’s travelling companions injured himself with a
gun and became unable to travel except at a very slow
pace. The slender stock of provisions was rapidly dis-
appearing, and the party were forced to kill one of the
horses for food, drying the flesh in the sun. For three
weeks the wounded man struggled on with the aid of his
comrades, but finally he grew too ill to proceed any
further. There was nothing for it but to still further
divide the party. Here Kennedy showed an heroic un-
selfishness, for he resolved to go on with the company of
only the black to help him through the bush. Ho in-
tended that the wounded man should have the protection
of both the other white men. The chance of any of them
surviving was less probably than they realized. Nor
could it be known to them, with the slender knowledge
they jiossessed of the nature of the murderous tribes
about them, that for a little party of white men to remain
stationary, so that the savages might surround them in
concentrated numbers, watch their chance, and
attack at whatever they judged to be the most favour-
able opportunity, was almost certain death. Judging
from his conduct throughout the experiences of the
expedition, Kennedy himself would probably have
remained behind, sending on one or both the others,
had he realized the probabilities arising out of the
situation. He left instructions that the three were to
remain where they were until the arrival of aid which
he would send to them, unless the wounded man died,
in which event the two survivors were to follow him.
So he left them, and they were never seen by white
men again.
The party were some distance inland when they
divided. Kennedy and his dusky companion, who dis-
played unswerving faithfulness throughout the adven-
tures which were to follow, jiroceeded safely till reach-
ing the sea. The sight of the blue water filled the travel-
lers with fresh hope, but in point of fact it heralded their
entry upon new dangers. They were crossing into a
region thickly populated with hostile tribes, and they
were still some days’ journey from their destination.
Not long elapsed before they met with some of the
savages. These gathered round and made signs of
J i lendliness, which Jacky considered to be suspiciously
demonstrative. However, Kennedy handed out presents
to the natives, and they continued their manifestations
of goodwill. The warnings of Jacky proved to be well
gi ounded, for when the two travellers resumed their
journey the savages followed close behind them and
would not be shaken off. Besides having been warned
of the danger, Kennedy knew of his own knowledge how
much to be avoided, had it been possible, was a position
such as his. When a tribe takes to following a party
of white men trouble may always be expected, and when
the party consists of only two the prospect may well
strike terror into the stoutest heart. Finally, the
blacks threw a shower of spears, and one of the missiles
hit Mr. Kennedy in the back. Jacky retaliated, and shot


one of the savages dead. But this only made the others
more cunning and more determined in their open
hostility. They sought cover behind trees, and used
their spears whenever an opportunity presented itself.
Kennedy endeavoured to fire, but to his horror dis-
covered that his powder was wet. Soon after be was
hit. by two other spears. Then the horses were also
being speared, and they galloped madly away, leaving
the t.vo men to their fate. However, the assailants
weie held temporarily at bay, and Jacky went a short
distance to secure the saddle-bags from a spot where
they had been laid. No sooner had he gone than the
blacks rushed round the
white man. Though they did
not follow their usual prac-
tice of clubbing him to
death, they stripped him of
all he had about him and
then went away. Jacky then
helped his leader to the
shelter of some scrub and did
his best to tend the spear
wounds. But Kennedy’s life
was ebbing fast, and telling
Jacky to “take the books to
the captain, not the big one,
take that to the Governor,
the Governor will give a lot
for it,” he fell back into the
faithful native’s arms and
died.
“I was crying a good
deal,” were the words of
Jacky in describing the event
when he reached helji, “un-
til I got well. That was
about an hour. And then
I buried him. 1 dug up
the ground with tomahawk,
and covered over the body with grass, a shirt and
trousers, and then with logs.” Jacky had carefully
tied up the papers containing particulars of Kennedy’s
journey while the latter still lived.
All the while the savages were lurking in the neigh-
bourhood. This was known to the guide, and he did not
leave the spot till dark. The natives saw him go and
threw spears at him, but he was saved by his bush
instinct. First he managed to dodge into thick scrub,
from which he succeeded in getting into a creek, along
which he walked for half a mile with his head only
above the water. Once emerging on dry land, Jacky
JOHN FREDERICK MANN, THE LAST SURVIVOR OR THE LEICHHARDT
EXPEDITION OF 1844-5, DIED AT SYDNEY, 1907
made all the speed he was capable of. For the follow-
ing two days he travelled as fast as be could, resting
only when compelled to do so by weakness. During this
period he came across no fresh water, nor would he lose
time in searching for it. The only food he ate consisted
of some scanty roots and a few reptiles which be caught.
After the second day he felt somewhat safer from
possible attacks by the murderers of Kennedy. Alto-
gether he was thirteen days in reaching the spot where
the ship lay waiting for the party.
Jacky made signs to those on the ship,
and was consequently taken on board. The faith-
ful fellow had preserved
Kennedy’s papers, and these
were handed to the captain,
who earnestly listened to the
native’s account of the last
sad tragedy. It was at once
realized that the lives of the
remaining eleven-—if, in-
deed, they should have sur-
vived so long—depended on
prompt action being taken
to rescue them. The cir-
cumstantial story told by
the black, corroborated as it
was by Kennedy’s papers,
left no room for doubting
the veracity of that faithful
follower of the lost ex-
plorer.
The vessel first sailed
for the spot on the coast
nearest to where the three
white men had been left in
the interior. A landing
party was guided by Jacky
until reaching a spot which
he calculated was a day’s
journey from where the wounded man and his
protectors had been left by Kennedy. A tribe of
savages were met with here, and in their possession was
found a quantity of articles obviously obtained from
Europeans, and which Jacky declared had belonged to
the party to which he had been attached. The sailors
then refused to proceed further. The reason they
advanced was that, as their provisions were running
short and they had left the ship in an unsafe position
on the coast, it would be dangerous as well as futile
to search for men who manifestly had been murdered.
The further fact that the eight men at Weymouth Bay


probably were urgently in need of provisions also
weighed with the officer in command, and so the party
returned to the shore.
The ship’s course was then set for Weymouth Hay.
Flere a sad tale of tragedy awaited the ears of the
deliverers. Indeed, had the latter been many days
later in arriving, probably no story would have been
told them, for the two sole survivors, who were all left
alive of the original eight, were fast reaching the limits
of their endurance. Ever since the departure of Ken-
nedy tl'3 little party had been waging a grim war against
starvation and the attacks of murderous savages. Very
few provisions had been left, and after a few days
almost the sole article of diet was horseflesh. The men
proved unable to subsist on this, and one of them died
very soon after the departure of the leader. His death
was quickly followed by that of another. The expedi-
tion had divided forces on November 10, and four weeks
later six men of the eight left at Weymouth Hay were
dead. During nearly the whole of the time the camp
was surrounded by a large tribe of blacks, numbering,
so far as could be estimated, close on seventy men. This
handicapped the Europeans in their weak state of
health for making excursions in search of food in the
adjacent country. Attempts were made by the natives
10 spear the strangers, out these attacks did not succeed.
Three weeks after Kennedy had left a schooner passed
along the coast, but those on board her apparently did
not observe the frantic signals made by tfie party on
shore to attract their attention. Tier departure into the
horizon left the stranded men more despondent than
they had been before. Towards the end of their
experience at the Bay the survivors grew so weak as to
be unable to bury the last two of their number who
had died, and the bodies had to be placed in a creek
because of the impossibility of digging graves.
As December advanced death appeared to stare the
two survivors in the face;. Weakness was almost pre-
venting them crawling outside the tent, and they were
consequently no longer able to go in search of food.
The natives now changed their demeanour. They had
previously been frightened off by a volley of shots from
the guns when they had thrown spears, but with the
numbers of the white men so diminished they ceased
their demonstrations of hostility and brought presents
of small supplies of food. Hut the Europeans were not
inclined to trust the savages, and lived in continual
dread of a treacherous attack. When the ship ulti-
mately arrived the two whites, including Carron, were
so exhausted that one of them had to be carried to the
boat and helped on board. During the departure the
natives again adopted their spirit of enmity, and,
repeating their former attack, wounded one of the crew.
The commander of the ship now desired to renew his
search for the other three missing explorers, but the
sailors steadfastly refused to penetrate the interior.
The vessel consequently returned to Sydney, carrying
with her one black and two white men as the sole sur-
vivors of the party of thirteen who had set out so hope-
fully on their enterprise less than a year before.
Soon after the return of the survivors the Govern-
ment ordered an investigation into the unfortunate fate
of the expedition. Mr. Carron had kept a fairly com-
plete diary of the experiences at Weymouth Hay, and
the journal of Kennedy provided a full account of events
which otherwise would have lain veiled in doubt and
mystery. These documents, supplemented by the evi-
dence of the three survivors, provided a full narrative
of all that had occurred to the members of the original
jsarty, except, of course, of the wounded man and his
two comrades, who had been left in the bush by Jacky
and the leader. No further trace was ever brought to
light of the unfortunate trio, and the theory that they
had been fallen upon, probably unexpectedly, and
slaughtered by the bloodthirsty savages admits of little
ground for doubt.
The evidence brought before the inquiry all went
to show that Kennedy had not only behaved with
unselfishness and bravery throughout, but also had done
the best he could for the welfare of his companions in
the various difficult situations in which unforeseen cir-
cumstances had placed him. It could not be said of
this enterprise, with any degree of accuracy, as unfor-
tunately has been true of other exploring expeditions,
that the disasters falling upon it were the result of
faulty leadership. From the nature of the task he was
undertaking, Kennedy was not able to guess the
character of the difficulties ahead in anything like the
way which was open to explorers penetrating country
of which an approximate idea had been obtained by
predecessors. His first journey had been prolonged
beyond any period he would naturally anticipate by the
unusually difficult country he had to traverse, there was
nothing to indicate to him that the savages of the
peninsula would prove as aggressive or as treacherous as
they turned out to be, and the immediate cause of the
death of himself and three other white men arose from
a pure accident, which could be ascribed to nothing but
the vagary of fortune. From sheer ill-luck almost every
possible obstacle fell in the way of this disastrous enter-
prise, and the leader displayed sound judgment and
indomitable courage in endeavouring to overcome them.
Such was the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence
brought to light by the official inquiry, and such was
the opinion formed by the public from the various
sources of information open to it.


The name of Augustus Charles Gregory, C.M.G.,
F.R.G.S., etc., Gold Medalist of the Royal Geogra-
phical Society, stands closely connected with the annals
of the search made for Leichhardt and his ill-starred
expedition. Though the actual fate of the latter party
was doomed to lie shrouded in a veil of mystery not
yet lifted, it was Gregory who gathered up and made
known the most of such scanty evidence of the final
wanderings of the lost band of explorers as was ever
to be discovered by white men. And, incidentally,
Gregory did more than any other leader during the
decade following the dis-
appearance of Leichhardt to
throw light upon the char-
acter of the north of the
Continent. A large portion
of his travels were over
the coastal regions of the
north of Western Australia
and of the Northern Terri-
tory; but he also accom-
plished far more than had
anyone else up to- that time
to make known the tropical
country to the east of the
138th degree of longitude—
the western boundary of
that part of Queensland.
It was he who found and
named the Leichhardt Liver,
the Gilbert, and a number
of other streams emptying
themselves into the Gulf of
Carpentaria, and afterwards
demonstrated the prac-
ticability of journeying
overland from the Gulf
country to the east
coast.
Augustus Charles Gregory was one of four brothers,
all of whom have left permanent places for their names
in the history of Australian land exploration. C. F.,
Frank T., and H. C. Gregory had all accomplished
valuable work on the western side of the Continent
before any of Ihe family became identified with eastern
enterprise of a similar nature. All were surveyors by
profession. During 1846 the three last-named covered
1,000 miles of new country in forty-seven days, equipped
only with four horses and but scanty provisions. Con-
siderable attention was attracted to the feat by coal
having been discovered during the enterpiise.
CHAPTER XIII.
AUGUSTUS C. GREGORY.
AUGUSTUS C. GREGORY.
On August 12, 1855, A. C. Gregory set out from
Sydney upon what proved to be the most successful expe-
dition to the northern country yet undertaken. At
about that period a general desire to know more about
the tropical regions of the Continent was manifesting
itself in no uncertain tones among the rapidly-increas-
ing population of the South. The Imperial Government
was then looked to for initiating some scheme for draw-
ing the tropical and sub-tropical parts of Australia
within the scope of the colonizing effort already so phe-
nomenally successful in the temperate districts. But it
was not until private indi-
viduals had demonstrated
their confidence in the value
of the results likely to accrue
from such an undertaking,
and when the good reasons
justifying the general desire
for such an enterprise being
launched were multiplied,
that the Administration con-
sented to provide the neces-
sary funds. That the matter
of clearing up the mysteri-
ous disappearance of Leich-
hardt should have sunk to so
small a place in the launch-
ing of the- scheme as to be
unmentioned in the official
documents is explained by
the length of time elapsing
since that explorer had set
out, destroying all possibility
of finding him or any of his
party still alive. First, Mr.
W. S. Lindsay, M.P., an-
nounced his readiness to pro-
vide money for the project,
and a Mr. Uzzielli offered
to give £lO,OOO to the same cause. The Imperial
Ministers then rendered these contributions unnecessary
by assuming the financial responsibilities of equipping
and sending out a party fitted for a lengthy and
comprehensive investigation of the north, to a large
extent over country traversed by Leichliardt. The
despatch dealing with the enterprise from the Duke of
Newcastle, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies,
to Captain Fitzgerald, Governor of Western Australia,
quite omits mention of a projected search for Leich-
hardt. The document set out that Her Majesty’s
Government had been long considering the proposal to


despatch an exploring expedition to lay open, if
favoured with success, more of the interior of the great
Australian Continent than the many energetic but
partial attempts hitherto made had succeeded in
developing. “The scheme,” said the despatch,
“originated with the Council of the Royal Geographical
Society, who corresponded with the Colonial Depart-
ment on the subject of it during the last winter. But
it was ultimately considered by Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment that the importance of the subject rendered it
more advisable that the expedition should be undertaken
under their own superintendence as a matter of public
concern, and Parliament has now placed at their dis-
posal a sum of £5,000 for the purpose, and will
undoubtedly give further assistance should it be re-
quisite.” The Duke of Newcastle went on to express
the opinion that from a general view of the correspond-
ence on the subject, “Moreton Bay would be a very
convenient rendezvous for the land portion of this
expedition; that they might be conveyed by sea to the
mouth of the Victoria River, on the north-west coast;
that it would be advantageous, if possible, that they
should act in concert with a Government vessel, which
might be employed in surveying operations in the Gulf
of Carpentaria and neighbourhood, while the land
explorers were engaged in the interior.” The Imperial
Government had decided to offer the leadership to Mr.
A. C. Gregory, then Assistant Surveyor to the Govern-
ment of Western Australia. The same authorities also
took a direct part in the appointment of the scientific
members of the expedition, though the selection of the
others was left to Gregory himself or to the Colonial
Government. The party ultimately collected consisted
of the following eighteen persons: —Commander, A. C.
Gregory; assistant commander, H. C.Gregory; geologist,
J. S. Wilson; artist and storekeeper, J. Baines;
surgeon and naturalist, J. R. Elsey; botanist, Dr.
(afterwards Baron von) Mueller; collector and preserver,
J. Flood; overseer, G. Phibbs; stockmen, C. Humph-
ries, R. B. Bowman, C. Dean, J. Melville, W. Dawson,
W. Shewed, W. Selby, S. Macdonald, H. Richards,
J. Fahey. Live stock taken from the last point of
settlement consisted of fifty horses and two hundred
sheep. The enterprise was officially known as “The
North Australian Exploring Expedition.”
The preliminary arrangements were made in
Sydney, from which port some of the party, together
with stores and equipment, sailed for Moreton Bay early
in July, 1855, in the barque “Monarch” and schooner
“Tom Tough.” These vessels, even in the short and
frequently traversed course to Brisbane, did not escape
the fate of mishap so commonly overtaking ships
engaged on the work of exploration. An extraordinary
feature about expeditions of discovery in Australia has
been the remarkable frequency with which ships
engaged on the work have come to grief. This unfor-
tunate record was maintained by the “Monarch” on
July 19, when she grounded on the bar at the mouth
of the Brisbane River and resisted all efforts to get her
off until a week later. As it was necessary to take the
barque to Brisbane the steamer “Ballarat” was
engaged, but this vessel immediately afterwards
struck a rock up the river near Ipswich and
sank herself. Then arrangements were made with the
owners of the “Hawk,” but the engines of the latter
were of insufficient power for the task. Finally the
steamer “Bremer” ostensibly attempted to bring the
“Monarch” to the headquarters of the settlement. The
extraordinary conduct of those in control of that vessel
is described by Gregory in the following words:—“lt
was evident, however, that the ‘Bremer’ did not intend
to do this, for she slacked the tow line and then
steamed ahead full speed and snapped the hawser, and
went off without explanation.” Gregory then goes on
to explain:—“Having removed a quantity of stores
from the ‘Monarch’ to the ‘Tom Tough,’ so as to reduce
the draught of the former, on August 8 she warped
over the bar and proceeded to Moreton Island, where
about three tons of water were taken in from the fresh-
water creeks near the pilot station. On August 12
weighed and left Moreton Bay, and this being the last
point of communication with the civilized world, the
exjjedition might be considered to commence on this
date.” The horses and sheep had been shipped from
Moreton Bay, where they had been purchased. A
sufficient supply of fodder had also been taken on
board.
Gregory passed Breaksea Spit and Port Curtis on
the morning of the 13th, and thirteen days later he
reached Port Albany, in Torres Strait, where some of
the party landed on Albany Island, described in the
journal of the leader of the expedition as being “of
sandstone formation rising into hills of moderate eleva-
tion, the soil generally poor and sandy, covered with
bush and small trees, with a few open grassy patches.
Fresh water was found in a small cove one hundred
yards north from the landing-place on the sandy beach;
the supply was so small as to be of little use and the
position inconvenient of access. The mainland appeared
to be covered with dense bush, and the rocky sandstone
kills did not indicate that the country was of any great
value, either for agricultural or pastoral purposes.”
Port Albany consisted of but a narrow channel lying
between Albany Island and the mainland of Cape York.
The current was found to be very strong there, owing
to the racing through of the tide. The two ships were
soon surrounded with native canoes, the occupants
apparently being well accustomed to visitors from
civilized countries and familiar with the use of tobacco,
for which they had made large bamboo pipes. A


remarkable feature about the blacks here was that they
were armed with bows and arrows, as well as with
spears, the former type of weapons being unheard of
in any other part of the Continent. In point of fact
they had been introduced by tribes migrating from the
islands to the north in comparatively recent times.
Each canoe had been rudely hollowed from a single
tree trunk and was fitted with an outrigger.
With the beginning of September the expedition
was overtaken by a series of disasters. On the night
of the Ist anchor was cast after the ships had passed
through Dundas Strait. Next morning they passed
Vernon Island, and at half-past nine on the same
evening the “Monarch” grounded on an ugly reef at
the entrance of Port Patterson, the captain having
failed to make sufficient allowance for the indraught of
the tide. To make matters
worse, it was found that the
vessel had struck at the top
of the spring tide, so that in
a very few hours she was high
and dry, and for some days
after every effort to float her proved
abortive. With the low tide the
ship was on her beam ends, and as
there were fifty horses on board
great anxiety was felt by the com-
mander. On September 10 the ship
was floated off the rocks. This was
accomplished by cutting off the false
keel and levelling the surface of the
reef so that the ship could be made
to glide along into deep water when
the tide was high and sufficient
power was put on to hauling
her. The “Monarch” herself was
found to have suffered little
damage.
The expedition was now far out of Queensland
waters and territory, but the circumstances of the
commencement of the overland journey are of consider-
able indirect interest to a student of the exploration
and subsequent development of the most north-eastern
of the States, as from the Victoria River Gregory and
his party worked eastward until reaching the Pacific
Coast. On leaving Vernon Island the commander,
taking the “Torn Tough,” which was found handier for
that kind of work, went on ahead to examine the mouth
of the Victoria. Sailing up the stream as far as
Blunder Bay, and finding it presented no place suitable
for landing stock, he returned to Treachery Bay, where
grass and water were plentiful. Her© part of the equip-
ment was got on shore, whilst other supplies were trans-
ferred from the “Monarch” to the “Tom Tough.” On
September 24 the “Monarch” sailed for Singapore.
The landing-place selected was the best within sight,
and the difficulties presenting themselves in keeping the
horses on the ship from dying while a better one was
found appeared insurmountable. But it was not to be
expected that horses in the sad condition those were
could be got on dry land in such a locality without some
mortality, or could then safely travel the few miles to
where there was fresh water. The landing was commenced
on the 18th. The horses had to swim two miles, and
strong tides were running, besides which the land was
bordered by difficult mangrove flats. Exhaustion
brought about the death by drowning of three of the
animals, one lost its life in the mud and mangroves, and
a fifth went mad, rushed into the bush and was not
again seen. After these operations had been completed
the commander of the “Tom Tough”
sailed up the river under instruc-
tions to establish a camp at the
highest convenient spot. Mean-
while the two Gregorys, Dr. Mueller,
and seven men set out overland,
intending to bring up the horses
in easy stages of from eight to ten
miles a day, so that wherever there
was grass or other feed the animals
might graze along ; and in that way
pick up the condition they had lost
during the voyage, and which would
be so much needed when their real
work began.
This portion of the un-
dertaking was attended by fresh
disasters. From Point Pearce
to the Macadam Range the coun-
try consisted mostly of grassy
plains, and water was plentiful.
Ihe range was rooky and difficult
of negotiation. The first mishap occurred on the fourth
day, when one of the horses became mysteriously ill
and shortly afterwards expired. Gregory assumed
the cause to be some unknown poisonous weed. On the
11th another horse was lost in the same manner. Two
nights later the horses were observed to be disturbed
while in camp. The origin of the trouble was not ascer-
tained until next day, when it was discovered that
they had been attacked by alligators, and that three
of them had been severely bitten and scratched. Two
other horses had to be abandoned. “Since these horses
were landed,” wrote Gregory, “they have not had
strength to rise without assistance, and it has been
necessary to watch them while feeding to lift them up
when they fall down through exhaustion.” Small
parties of blacks were met with from time to time but
DUNCAN MACLNTYRE.


nothing in the nature of a conflict took place between
the natives and the white visitors. On the 16th the
Victoria River was sighted about six miles below Kan-
garoo Point. In attempting to cross some hills here the
party was intercepted by a deep gully. Water was
observed in a pool at the bottom of this ravine, three
hundred feet below the ground on which the travellers
were standing. As supplies were short it was deter-
mined to lower a man to this by means of a rope, but
before the proceeding commenced a spring was dis-
covered at the top of the cliff. Two days later Gregory
came across the remains of a large fire and the stumps
of half a dozen trees which had been felled by aid of a
steel axe. This obviously was the remains of a camp
formed bv members of the party of ‘ Tom Tough.”
Gregory searched to find some mark to guide him as to
the present whereabouts of the vessel, as he had given
definite instructions that such memorandum should
be left at landing-places. None was to be found, and
he therefore was at a loss to know if the ship had
proceeded up the river. However, he resolved to con-
tinue his route to some convenient spot for a camp
near Steep Hill.
On the 19th they ascended a creek flowing into the
Victoria, and reached the termination of the salt water,
where the river divided into several small dry channels.
In one of these they found a small pool of fresh water,
and here a camp was made.' This was early in the
afternoon. Some of the party set about shooting the
game of the locality, and returned with a wild turkey,
a hawk, and thirty-nine cockatoos. The country was
well grassed. Next day they made back for the river,
which they reached late in the afternoon, and after
following it for half an hour observed a boat and a tent
on the opposite bank.
On the junction of the party the first information
to greet Gregory was of the least welcome character.
The schooner had grounded and had been badly
damaged on a bank below Mosquito Flat. “The ‘Tom
Tough,’ ” wrote Gregory, “had reached Entrance
Island on September 25, and the next day anchored off
Rugged Ridge; on the 27th was proceeding up the
river and grounded on a ledge of rocks on the south side
of the river, six miles below Mosquito Flat, and from that
date was never sufficiently afloat to be under control,
but gradually drifted up to about two and a half miles
below Curiosity Peak. From the time of getting on
the rocks she had leaked considerably, and a large
quantity of stores had been destroyed or damaged,
there being at one time four feet of water in the hold ;
but by nailing battens and tarred blankets over the
open seams the leaks had been greatly reduced. The
stock of water on board the schooner having been
exhausted by her detention, Mr. Wilson had sent a boat
up to Palm Island to bring down a supply, but having
greatly miscalculated the time requisite for this expedi-
tion up the river, the distance being sixty miles, the
sheep had been kept several days without a sufficient
supply of water, and a great number had died.”
Fourteen sheep had been brought up to the camp
where the Gregorys had fallen in with the party from
the “Tom Tough,” and in the evening a boat arrived
with twelve more, several others having been lost dur-
ing the voyage from the schooner. None of the sheep
were in sufficiently good condition to be fit for food, and
the camp contained but the slenderest stock of other
provisions. Consequently the commander was unable to
send back the supplies he had hoped for to a small
detachment of men he had left behind with a number of
the horses which had not been able to travel at anything
beyond a snail’s pace. Two days later the commander
reached the schooner, which he found deeply embedded
in mud, and he at once sent back the gig with provi-
sions for a month. Fifty-three sheep remained on board
the vessel, which, with those at the camp, made eighty-
one as the survivors of the original two hundred. This
number was further reduced in landing those on the ship,
and they were in so miserable a condition that
six others perished from exhaustion while walking from
the landing-place to where fresh water was to be
obtained for drinking purposes, one more dying the
following night. The task of transporting live stock
by means of small sailing craft was proving no simple
undertaking.
Eventually the “Tom Tough,” being lightened of
portion of her cargo, was floated off the mudbank and
her bottom examined. She had first struck rock and
had then drifted on to the softer material. The former
was found to have severely broken her timbers, and to
make her safe for further service in the open sea pre-
sented no insignificant task. One of the strong features
in Gregory’s claim to rank highly among leaders
of exploring parties was the thoroughness with which
he had essential tasks carried out, and the consistency
with which he safeguarded his parties against risks
which could possibly be foreseen. The best of substan-
tial repairs were effected to the schooner, and she was
moved to a carefully-chosen spot some miles above
Kangaroo Point. The first operation here was the
erection of a shed for the protection of the stores from
the weather. On the day of arrival the party were
afforded a second demonstration of the perpetual danger
run both by animals and men from the alligators which
the river waters held, often in shapes so closely
resembling logs that no notice might be taken of their
presence until with lightning-like rush they dashed iipon
their prey. This was on October 29, and one of the
kangaroo dogs which had been brought by the party
was unexpectedly seized by one of the huge savage
reptiles and instantly drowned.


Th© sheep were brought up to this place; but more
of them had been lost, and only twenty-six were now
left. Writing on the 31st, G regory said: —“Messrs.
Wilson, Baines, and Mueller, with the party in charge
of the sheep, arrived at 7 a.m., bringing the remainder
of the sheep, twenty-six in number, eleven having been
drowned from want of proper care in bailing the boat,
which consequently sank during the night.” A minute
overhaul of the “Tom Tough,” preparatory to the com-
mencement of repairs, showed the damage to be fully
as extensive as had at first been supposed.
Gregory remained at this camp until November
24. During this time he formulated a code of regu-
lations for the efficient working and discipline of the
party, each member being allotted specific duties and
obligations. Excursions were made into the interior
of the Continent in several directions, but the details of
that portion of the enterprise form no part of the his-
tory of Queensland exploration.
On June 21 Gregory set
out upon his big overland
journey, which took him
completely across Queens-
land from west to east, and
revealed much of the char-
acter of the northern part of
the coastal and inland parts
of the Colony hitherto un-
known. The party setting out
on this ambitious and splen-
didly successful undertaking
consisted of:—Commander,
A C. Gregory; assistant com-
mander, 11. C. Gregory; bot-
anist, Dr. Mueller;geologist,
J. S. Wilson; surgeon and
naturalist, J. R. Elsey; har-
ness-maker, C. Dean; farrier, 11. B. Bowman; and
stockman, J. Melville. In two months the party
had passed into the Colony of Queensland, and on
August 30 had crossed the Nicholson and were on
Beames Brook of Leichhardt; an important tributary
of the Albert. This was in longitude 139° 23'; longi-
tude 138° forming the boundary line between the north-
eastern Colony and the Northern Territory. The same
day another creek was met with, and a few miles lower
down tlris was found to junction with a smaller stream,
the two together forming the Albert River. this spot
between the two creeks,” wrote Gregory, "was the ren-
dezvous appointed for the two sections of the expedition,
but we were disappointed in our hope that the vessel
had reached the Albert.
An important decision had then to be arrived at.
One of two courses must be adopted. Either the party
L
could wait for the “Tom Tough,” and what extra
equipment she might bring in the way of stores, or
else the journey to the south-east might be continued
without delay. There were still in hand five months’
supply of flour, tea, sugar, and like articles, and three
months’ supply of meat, all at full rations, whilst any
deficiency of meat which might arise could be made up
from the horses. “If required,” wrote Gregory, “we
have sufficient quantity of provisions to enable the party
to reach the settled part of New South Wales, unless
extraordinary difficulties should be encountered; under
the circumstances it did not ajopear prudent to delay at
the Albert River, as the arrival of the ‘Tom Tough’
might be deferred for an indefinite period.” Written
documents were left to be discovered by Mr. Baines
when he should reach the spot with the schooner, which
had meanwhile proceeded to Timor for supplies. The
memorandum stated that Gregory had pushed forward
in the quest of finding a more direct route between the
Albert and Moreton Bay
than Leichhardt had done.
On the morning of Sep-
tember 3 the camp was
broken and the party set out
in an easterly direction
over box flats and open grass
land. In the evening they
came to a shallow pool on a
small creek trending to the
north. "The country,”
wrote Gregory, “consists of
vast, level open plains, sej>
arated by narrow belts of
box and terminalia trees;
the soil a brown clay loam,
producing rather short and
dry grass. On approaching
the waterhole at which we encamped a black and three
or four women were found camped on the opposite side
of the creek; they climbed the trees and remained
among the branches till dusk, when they descended to
their fires and made a great noise till nine o’clock, when
they decamped. This creek is probably the head of the
salt-water arm of the Albert River or of the Disaster
River.” The next day other natives were met, but
tact on the part of the white men obviated anything
in the nature of a conflict. Gregory goes on
to say that the river was probably the same
as that which Leichhardt has supposed to be the
Albert—an error causing considerable confusion in
framing the maps of his route. Gregory named it after
the ill-fated explorer, who probably had met his doom
not many hundreds of miles from the spot. The party
were now making south-east across the belt of country
TREE MARKED BY DUNCAN MCLNTYRE.


known as the Plains of Promise, with the nature of
which the leader expressed considerable disappointment.
The country was described as being inferior, the grass
consisting principally of aristidia and andropogon, with
anthistiria, or kangaroo grass, existing only in small
patches. The soil was good brown loam.
During the next few days signs of natives were
numerous, whilst horse feed, though dry and fluctuat-
ing in quantity, proved adequate for requirements. On
the Bth they reached the Flinders. The channel here
was one hundred yards wide, but held only shallow
pools. The country passed through on the 14th was
very poor, several dry waterholes trending to
the west were crossed, and a couple of hours after
noon a halt was made beside a small waterhole, which,
by being enlarged, was made with difficulty to supply
sufficient drink for the stock. The grass just here was
nutritious, but very dry. Next day it was felt that
the horses required rest, but none of the camps offered
sufficient feed to allow of a stop being made. All that
day the country jmoved very poor, and by sundown the
travellers were sorely in need of water. Darkness found
the party camped waterless by the dry bed of a creek,
but during the evening Gregory himself set out on foot
down the course of this spasmodic stream, and after
progressing for only half a mile he was fortunate
enough to find a good pool. Advantage was taken
of the ample supplies of grass and water to spend the
following day resting the horses. After pushing for-
ward during the 18th, a second suitable resting-place
was found, and here a halt was made for several days.
This opportunity was taken of killing one of the least
serviceable of the horses and thus replenishing the stock
of meat. The flesh was cut into strips and hung
in the sun to dry, so that it was put in a state of
preservation rendering it excellent food, even though
it might be carried for weeks before being consumed.
Owing to meat thus being rendered abundant, the daily
ration of flour was cut down to three-quarters of a
pound.
Towards noon on the 21st the party came upon the
bed of a large creek or river, which however was not
flowing, the only remaining water being what was con-
tained by a few small pools. This was the Gilbert. The
direction of the stream was mostly from the south-east,
along which route the party traced it for about 180
miles. Two days’ journey further up the banks
were only fifteen feet high, and on the exterior
sides the land dropped away, so that in times
of heavy rain the country must be inundated. On the
28th Gregory walked to the top of a hill of low altitude,
but from which, owing to the flatness of the surrounding
country, he was able to command an extensive view.
The country, as seen from this point, he described as
being generally level in appearance, but consisting of
numerous low ridges and detached hills of granite, with
sandstone on the summits. The valley of the river
extended to the east and south, and a large branch
appeared to join from the south about ten miles lower
down, as a valley and some ranges of hills trended in
that direction. The whole face of the country had an
arid and desolate aspect, as there were no large trees
except along the principal watercourses, and many of
the hills appeared destitute of any vegetation other than
the small acacias and scrub trees, the bare rock showing
through its scanty covering.
The next day water was found to be inconveniently
scarce. The geological structure of the part of the
country then being passed through is described as wholly
dissimilar to any other part of North Australia with
which Gregory was familiar. The rock appeared to
have been subjected to considerable disturbance, as the
slate was much broken and contorted and in several
places altered by contact with porphyry, whilst no defi-
nite strike or dip appeared to exist. The Gilbert
goldfield was discovered afterwards in this locality.
The aspect of the country continued barren, rock form-
ing the most conspicuous feature.
As the expedition proceeded on an easterly course
lava became more frequent, and at length covered the
whole surface. Streams of lava, in the form of abrupt
ridges of rough rock, presented obstacles which were
crossed only with difficulty. These jagged strips lay in
a north to south direction, and were from thirty to forty
feet in height. A native well was seen on the 13th, and
two small pools of rainwater were found among the
rocks after nightfall.
Traces of Leichhardt having passed through the
country were met with on the 17th, but the particular
expedition of the botanist-explorer from which the
evidence had been left was not that from which he and
his companions had failed to return. The fragments
of a bullock’s shoulder-bone were picked up, whilst some
of the trees were clearly observed to have been cut with
a steel axe. The latitude was found to correspond with
that of Leichhardt’s camp of April 26, 1845. The
slaughtering of a bullock at this place had been recorded
by Leichhardt.
On passing over the Divide Gregory had come upon
the source of a small watercourse, which soon developed
into a sandy creek and later joined the Burdekin. The
bed of the latter at this point was 100 yards wide, b\xt
it contained a stream only ten yards in width. Tire
channel was almost filled with melaleuca and casuarina
trees. The day of observing Leichhardt’s camp, the
Moreton Bay ash, the poplar gum, and another variety
of gum tree not previously met on the journey from the
Gulf, were seen to mingle with the species of trees
holding sway in the western country. The following
day (a Saturday) the last of the horseflesh was


consumed. The Sunday both men and beasts spent en-
joying a well-earned rest, the journey being resumed on
the 20th.
During the 20th the party crossed the Clarke River
which altered its course to a more easterly direction, and
passed over well-grassed flats to the foot of a rocky range
of sandstone hills, of which the highest ridge was
ascended. The country between the Clarke and the
Bui dekin, at the spot he then was in, shortly before
thoir junction, Gregory described as of excellent quality,
consisting of well-grassed fiats, timbered with ironbark,
Moreton Bay, ash, poplar gum, and box trees. The
Clarke at that point was 100 yards wide, with a sandy
bed crossed by ridges of slate rock. It appeared from
the evidences to be seen that the Clarke carried the
greater volume of flood waters, but that the steady flow
was larger in the Burdekin.
Gregory followed down the course of the Burdekin,
which trended in a south-easterly direction, until he
came upon its junction with the Suttor, which was
reached on October 30, and which the commander of the
expedition described as but a small stream compared
with the Burdekin; but near the first camp he formed
on its bank the former contained some fine reaches 180
yards wide, though of no considerable depth. Here
again the trees on the banks had been much broken
and bent by a violent flood which, in this instance, had
occurred within that year. Writing at this period.
Gregory expressed his opinion of what he had seen in
the following terms: —“Considering the number of
miles we have travelled along the banks of the Burdekin
few impediments have been encountered, whilst the
extent of country suited for squatting purposes is very
considerable, water forming a never-failing stream
throughout the whole distance.” As he desired to link
up the explorations of Leichhardt with these of Sir
Thomas Mitchell, Gregory followed the course of the
Suttor in a southerly direction. On the 2nd water
and grass were found in abundance, so that a day’s rest
was enjoyed. During the previous week the river had
been running, and though it had now ceased the various
holes along the channel had been filled. Blacks
were met with in small parties in this portion
of the journey, but hostilities were carefully
avoided by the white men. Nor indeed were
they looked for by the natives, who usually made
off as fast as their legs could be made to carry them.
The marks of iron tomahawks was a remark-
able circumstance observed at this stage of the journey
by the explorers.
The party succeeded in establishing the fact of the
Belyando and the Cape Rivers being separate streams.
The f ormer was traced to latitude 22°, the routes of the
previous explorers thus being connected as was hoped.
The party then struck off to the south-east. On
l 2
November 6 Uiey were within sight of Mount Narrieu
and Peak Range. Two days later an eleven-month-old
filly, which had been born during the travels of the
expedition, was shot, and its liesh turned into meat.
Nor was any of the carcase wasted. “The skin,’’ nar-
rated Gregory, “was cleared of hair and was thus made
into a species of gelatine, from which excellent soup was
subsequently prepared.”
At the junction of the Mackenzie and the Comet,
which was reached on the 17th, the remains of a camp
formed by Dr. Leichhardt’s party on their second journey
was discovered. The ashes of the fire were still visible,
and a quantity of bones of goats were scattered around.
A large tree was marked by a big “L” being cut upon
it, with the word “Dig” and an arrow. However a
hollow in the ground at the foot of the tree showed that
whatever had been deposited there had long since been
removed.
On the 21st the party reached the station of Messrs.
Fitz and Connor on the Dawson River, where they were
hospitably received. They were still 400 miles from
Brisbane, but owing to the kindly welcomes extended to
them by the squatters in possession of the intervening
country they made a comfortable journey to the capital
of the Colony. The time occupied in travelling from
the Victoria River to Messrs. Fitz and Connor’s home-
stead, the first outpost of settlement they fell in with,
had been five months and two days. “Thus,” wrote
the leader of this triumphantly successful enterprise,
“the explorations of the North Australian Expedition
terminated, after an absence of sixteen months without
communication with the civilized world, and during
which period we had travelled more than 2,000 miles
by sea and nearly 5,000 by land. Perhaps no expedi-
tion has yet been undertaken in Australia in which
the elements of both success and failure have been so
largely combined, for though the liberal manner in
which the exploring party had been equipped and sup-
ported left nothing to be desired in this respect, yet
the long voyage through a sea remarkable for its dangers
and the extensive combinations necessary in the arrange-
ments —a failure in any single point of which would
have crippled or even annihilated the expedition—added
to the ordinary liabilities attending exposures to the
vicissitudes of a tropical climate, hostile natives, and
desert country, present such an array of difficulties that
I feel oui' utmost endeavours could not have availed had
it not been for the protection of that Providence without
which we are powerless.”
Great practical value resulted from Gregory’s
North Australian Expedition. His account of the Gulf
country was more temperate and accurate than any yet
made, and no one before his journey had opened so
practical or direct a route from (he northern coast to
the Pacific slopes of Queensland,


CHAPTER XIV.
A. C. GREGORY IN QUEST OF LEICHHARDT.
A. C. Gregory had completed his successful expedi-
tion to North Australia during the close of 1856. On
January 12, 1858, between thirteen and fourteen months
later, he set out upon an endeavour to solve, if that
should prove possible, the mystery surrounding the fate
of Dr. Leichhardt, who had penetrated into the interior
of the Continent never to return, thirteen years earlier.
Considerably less than a year of respite from the priva-
tions and strenuous work of travel in the sun-baked
northern wilderness had been enjoyed by this inde-
fatigable explorer from the time of clearing up the
business attaching to the former undertaking and com-
mencing the preliminary arrangements necessitated by
his having agreed to lead the search party sent out by
the Government of New South Wales.
A remarkable feature of this endeavour lay in the
late date of its initiation, nearly a decade and a half
having passed since the disappearance of Leichhardt
and his companions. The authorities of those days
might have been expected to have exhausted all possi-
bility of discovering the missing men whilst reasonable
prospect of them remaining alive lasted. That an effort
to find the whereabouts of their remains and the story
of their death should be launched at a date appearing
on the face of it to be many years later than they could
have survived, even under the most unlikely of favour-
able circumstances, would tend to indicate that very
much which clearly ought to have been done was
neglected at a time when hope still lingered. But the
truth was that a highly circumstantial story of the
whereabouts of Leichhardt and his companions was
communicated to the authorities by a convict named
Garbut, then in confinement on Cockatoo Island in Port
Jackson. Garbut’s tale was certainly sensational. To
people inclining towards scepticism by nature it must
have appeared even from the first as more melodramatic
than probable. But the man declared he knew Leich-
hardt to be alive and restrained by the force of others
from attempting to make his way back to civilization.
The public had never felt satisfied with any of the
theories advanced by explorers and others to account
for the probable fate of the missing party. The first
tale, told by the blacks, of the whole party having been
massacred by hostile tribes was not generally accepted.
Hovenden Hely had done a good deal to discredit that
explanation of the tragedy. Nothing appeared to throw
any light upon the mystery. Three causes of death had at
one time or another been advanced as providing the most
probable solution to the puzzle. Thirst and starvation
might have brought death in the desert of the interior;
one of the mighty inundations which sometimes cover
the northern plains with flood waters extending as far
as the eye can reach might have drowned the travellers
and washed away most of the belongings which, under
other circumstances, might have afforded an indication
of what had happened; or wholesale murder might have
occurred unexpectedly in the middle of some dark night.
The search of Hely over 300 miles of country to the spot
said to be the scene of the alleged murder had done
nothing to settle the public mind. Rather the reverse
bad occurred, for Hely’s investigations had resulted only
in the statements of the natives being disbelieved.
As related in his “History of Discovery in Aus-
tralia, Tasmania, and New Zealand,” Mr. William
Howitt quotes Garbut’s tale as follows:—“That far in
the interior, beyond even the bounds of pastoral enter-
prise, was a tract of rich well-watered country, peopled
by a colony of runaway convicts, who had married native
women and kept up a communication with the settle-
ments by means of pack-horses, obtaining in this way
not only new recruits of their own stamp, but supplies
of necessaries and even luxuries. Dr. Leichhardt and
his party, he said, came suddenly upon this colony
directly after leaving the settled district, and for fear
he or they should divulge its existence were forcibly
detained. Garbut offered, if liberated, to lead a party
to the spot, but stated that his brother and uncle, also
convicts, had been there as well as he, and sought, we
believe, their liberty also. He asserted that the last of
Leichhardt’s camps, discovered by Mr. Hovenden Hely
during his expedition of 1853, was within two hundred
miles of the settlement which he professed to describe.”
This story soon caused considerable public sensation.
A frothy element in every community is always ready
to leap at whatever savours of the melodramatic. And
a tale which stimulates the imagination and appeals to
the sentiment of romance will gain ground before
objections which cool consideration raises against its
probability can overtake it. But investigation and cross-
examination of Garbut himself soon showed the story to
be a fabrication of the convict’s own imagination. The
fable was dissipated yet public thirst for knowledge
which might throw light on the fate of Leichhardt had
been revived. Indeed this desire had been growing for
o o
some time previous to the sensation created by
the prisoner. His tale served merely to bring a feeling
of general dissatisfaction and restlessness on the matter
to a climax. A public meeting, held in Sydney on
October 11, 1857, resolved to invoke the aid of the local
Government in launching an effort aimed at ascertaining
the long-hidden facts, and Parliament consequently
agreed to find the necessary funds. When Augustus


Gregory offered his services in the capacity of leader of
such an expedition as would be needed to go in search
of traces of the route and the end of the missing party,
officials and the public at once felt that the community
had no one else so eminently qualified for the position,
and he was duly appointed.
The objects aimed at xvere officially stated as fol-
lows: (1) To ascertain the fate of the late Dr. Leich-
hardt, and (2) to connect the exploring surveys of
Mitchell and Kennedy with his own. Writing on
September 15 to the Colonial Secretary, Gregory esti-
mated the probable cost of the expedition at a sum of
£4,500.
Augustus Gregory’s brother (C. F. Gregory) was
placed second in command. Besides these two, the
party consisted of two overseers (S. Burgoyne and G.
Phibbs) and five experienced bushmen (R. Bowman, W.
Selby, T. Dunn, W. von Wedel, and D. Worrell). Por-
tion of the equipment was taken by the commander from
Sydney to Moreton Bay, and from here he proceeded to
Ipswich, at the latter
place purchasing ten saddle
and thirty pack-horses.
The stores were meanwhile
despatched by drays to Mr.
Royd’s station on the Daw-
son River. The total
weight of equipment was
4,600 lb., exclusive of sad-
dles and harness, the aver-
age load carried by each
pack-horse thus worked out
at about 150 lb. Something
more than ordinary interest
attached to Gregory’s calcu-
lation, as made at this
period, of the carrying capacity of a horse engaged on
exploration work in Northern Australia, seeing that no
living man held so wide an experience as a leader of
successful expeditions of investigation of those regions.
These arrangements were completed during the first
week of January, 1858.
The party reached the Maranoa River in about
latitude 25° 45', near the source of that stream and not
many miles to the westward of the culminating ridge of
the Great Divide. Even at this early stage of the
journey difficulty was met with in obtaining water, and
wells had to be dug in the dry bed of the stream in
order to secure a supply. As both Kennedy and Hoven-
den Hely had been unable to penetrate further to the
westward in the same latitude on account of this
obstacle, the expedition adhered to the course of the
Maranoa for the short distance to Mount Owen, where
plentiful quantities of both feed and water for the horses
rendered practicable a few days of well-earned lest. On
resuming the journey Gregory led his companions across
a range to a creek emptying into the Warrego, which,
like the Maranoa, flows in its early stages in a south-
westerly direction. Some fine valleys of open-timbered
land, well suited for pastoral pursuits, were here fallen in
with. This class of country, alternating with ridges of
scrub of brigalow acacia, was traversed until the party
reached Mount Playfair, a basaltic hill on a sandstone
range dividing the valley of the W irrego from that of
the Nive. A creek forming a tributary of the latter
was soon afterwards reached and was followed
down to where it joined the larger stream, in latitude
25° 6'. Pools of permanent water, with fish in them,
and numerous native camps were found here. The
country was sandy, thinly grassed, and openly timbered,
rising in low sandstone ridges covered with dense scrub
of brigalow acacia. Severe drought had diminished the
supplies of grass, and only in occasional patches could
sufficient feed be obtained for the horses.
From the Nive the party pursued a north-north-
west course through scrub
growing on sandy, level
country, so that progress
was necessarily slow until
reaching to within six miles
of the Barcoo, or Victoria,
as the river was then called.
At- this point they emerged
upon open downs of fertile
clay. But the long period of
rainlessness had destroyed
all vegetation, and the coun-
try bore the appearance of
being a complete desert.
The bed of the Barcoo was
quite dry, and after diligent
search the best that could be done for the stock was
the discovery of a small pool of water surrounded with
a few widely-scattered tufts of grass.
They were now following the route which Leich-
hardt had declared his intention of taking, and the
party divided so that both sides of the river might
be swept in a face and all probable positions of camps
examined. Even with these precautions taken, but
slender chances existed of finding the evidence of where
the lost explorers had formed their resting-places if they
should have passed that way. That heavy floods had
occurred during the previous year was clear, marks on
the ground going to show that the country for a mile
from each bank had been under water. If tracks had
existed they would have been obliterated by the inunda-
tions. Water remained scarce as they passed down
the river, and the plentiful vegetation seen in the same
locality by Sir Thomas Mitchell had entirely disap-
peared. The route was now south-west, and in latitude
STONE ERECTED TO DUNCAN MACLNTYRE.


24° 87' a small sandy creek, of equal size to the Barcoo
itself, joined that stream from the east. At this point
some improvement was noticed in the grass.
In this locality, on April 21, the first natives met
with on the journey were seen. These were detected
by the commander while the horses were being collected
at a small pool of water at which a halt had been made.
On the same day, a few miles down the river
from where this incident occurred, the party
met with the only clear evidence they were des-
tined to find during the whole expedition of having
come upon the trail of Leichhardt. In latitude 24° 25'
and longitude 145° they discovered a Moreton Bay
ash, about two feet in diameter at the butt, on which
a big letter “L” had been cut through the bark about
four feet from the ground. Near at hand were the
stumps of smaller trees, which had been cut down with
a sharp axe, whilst a deep notch in a sloping tree had
apparently been put there to support the horizontal
ridge pole of a tent, or for some similar purpose. All
the evidences were regarded by Gregory as indicating
that a camp had been formed here by Leichhardt’s party.
"The tree,” he wrote, "was near the bank of a small
reach of water, which is noted on Sir Thomas Mitchell’s
map. This, together with his actual and relative posi-
tion, as regards other features of the country, prove it
not to have been either one of Sir Thomas Mitchell’s or
Kennedy’s camps, as neither encamped within several
miles of the spot; besides which, the letter could not
have been marked by either of them to designate the
number of the camp, as the former had long jmssed his
fiftieth camp, and the latter had not reached that
number on the outward route, and numbered his camps
from his furthest point attained on his return journey.
Notwithstanding a careful search, no trace of stock could
be found. This is, however, easily accounted for, as
the country had been inundated last season, though the
current had not been sufficiently strong to remove some
emu bones and mussel shells which lay round a native
camping-place within a few yards of the spot. No
other intimation having been found, we continued the
search down the river, examining every likely spot for
marked trees, but without success. The general aspect
of the country was extremely level, and even the few
distant ridges, which were visible, had but small eleva-
tion above the plain, the highest apparently not exceed-
ing 200 or 300 feet. Timber was wholly confined to the
bank of the river, and though open plains existed
acacia scrubs were the principal feature. Water became
very scarce in the channels of the river, and we were
principally dependent on small puddles of rainwater
from a recent thunder shower, but as we approached
the northern bend some fine reaches of water were
passed.”
Gregory continued his search along the course of
the Barcoo without success and under conditions of great
hardship and very real danger. During the middle of
April the conditions of the party became critical. r J he
country at the junction of the Alice was thoroughly
searched, but without result. “A long continuance of
drought,” wrote the commander of the expedition, ‘‘had
not only dried up all the water, except in the deepest
hollows in the channel of the main river, but the smaller
vegetation, and even the trees on the back country were
annihilated, rendering the country almost impracticable
from the quantity of fallen dead branches, and even in
the bed of the river, where the inundation derived from
the heavy rain near the sources of the river last year
had somewhat refreshed the grass, it was scarcely pos-
sible to find subsistence for the horses. Under existing
circumstances it would have been certain destruction to
attempt a north-west route from this point, and the only
course that appeared open to us was to follow down the
main river to the junction of the Thomson River, and
to ascend that watercourse so as to intersect Leichhardt’s
probable line of route, had he penetrated in that direc-
tion, favoured by a better season. At this time, it was
probable that, like ourselves, he had been repulsed, and
would then follow down the river and search for a more
favourable jmint from which to commence his north-
west course, in order to round the desert interior from
the northern side, and we therefore continued our search
down towards the Thomson River.”
During the last days of April Gregory passed over
country completely flat and bearing traces of tremend-
ous floods. Water was still scarce and grass “seldom
seen.” On May 2 heavy rain fell, water be-
came plentiful, and considerable difficulties were
met with in the shape of soft ground and the
intricacies of a network of channels. Gregory ob-
serves that, had the rain continued, annihilation through
drowning would have been a likely fate to overtake the
joarty, as the camp was between deep channels which
intersected the plain. “In attempting,” he writes, “to
extricate ourselves from the plains subject to inundation
(we) found ourselves so completely entangled among the
numerous deep channels and boggy gullies, in some of
which the horses narrowly escaped suffocation in the
soft mud, that after having forded one branch of the
river, carrying the whole equipment across on our own
backs, constructing a bridge over a second for the trans-
port of the stores, and dragging the horses through as
best we could with ropes —after three days of the severe
toil we had scarcely accomplished a direct distance of
five miles. The dry weather which followed rapidly
hardened the surface of the clay plains, and I attempted
to steer due west to the Thomson, but found the
country so destitute of food, and covered with dense
acacia scrub, that we were compelled to return to the
plain on the bank of the river.”


The party was now approaching the junction of the
Thomson where the country was almost devoid
of vegetation. A route was taken up the course of the
river iu a northerly direction, until reaching latitude
23° 47', when the absence of grass and water compelled
a letieat. This, wrote Gregory, “was a most severe
disappointment, as we had just reached the part of
the country through which Leichhardt most probably
travelled, il the season was sufficiently wet to render it
practicable. 1 bus compelled to abandon the principal
object of the expedition, only two courses remained
open-—either to return to the head of the Victoria
(Barcoo) River and attempt a northern course by the
valley of the Belyando, or to follow down the river and
ascertain whether it flowed
into Coopers Creek or the
Darling. The latter course
appeared most desirable, as
it was just possible that
Leichhardt, under similar
circumstances had been
driven to the south-west. In
order to ascertain whether
any large' watercourses came
from the west, the return
route was along the right
bank of the Thomson," but
only one small creek and
some inconsiderable gullies
joined on that side; nor
was the country of a better
character than on the left
bank, consisting of barren
plains, subject to inunda-
tion, low, rocky ridges cov-
ered with dense scrub, and
sandy ridges producing
triodia.”
When near the Barcoo
Worrell’s horse fell with
him, and the rider was in-
jured sufficiently to render a
halt necessary for the following day which was Sunday.
Fortunately a patch of grass was found at the locality
of the mishap. The rain previously experienced had
not extended so far south as the district now occupied
by the party. Desolate plains, destitute of vegetation,
stretched to the horizon on every side. On the 27th
they had reached nearly to the furthest point attained
by Kennedy, when failing strength on the part of the
horses, coupled with the complete absence of water in
the channels on the east side of the plain, forced the
party to cross on to the western side of the river’s bed.
Great trouble was produced by the deep cracks in the
dry alluvial mud, which were continually bringing
horses down, and which so exhausted one of them that
if had to he abandoned. The animals had been rendered
weak by insufficient food, all they could find on some
days being decayed weeds, whilst they eagerly devoured
the thatch of some old native huts which were found.
Next day the party reached the site of Kennedy’s second
camp on his return journey twelve years before. The
small waterhole which had served to refresh the stock
of the earlier explorer had almost dried up, containing
a quite insufficient supply to meet the needs of so many
horses as were with Gregory. A small patch of scat-
tered tufts comprised all the grass available. The
letter “K” over “IT.” was seen cut on the trunk of a
large box tree.
In the beginning of
June the party had crossed
into the territory of South
Australia. In latitude 27°,
where they were on the 4th,
a low sandstone tableland
approached the west side of
the river. On reaching
latitude 27° 30' this table-
land was found to recede, and
a boundless expanse of mud
plain was before the party.
“Steering west-north-west,”
wrote Gregory, “the several
channels closed on both
sides; the soil of the inter-
vening plain was much
firmer, but showed by the
vegetation that saline nature
which so often attends the
development of the upper
sandstones in Australia.
Grass was abundant, and it
was surprising with what
rapidity the horses recovered
their strength.”ln longitude
140° 30', shortly before reach-
ing the branch of Coopers
Creek named Strzelecki Creek by Captain Sturt, the
tracks of two horses were observed. One resembled that of
a draught horse, whilst the other was a beast of speedier
type. Gregory concluded that “there can be little
doubt that these horses belonged to Captain Sturt, who
left one in an exhausted state near this locality, and also
lost a second horse, whose tracks were followed many
miles in the direction of Cooper’s Creek.”
Some of the information collected by Gregory in
this region was of interest even on the Queensland side
of the border. He was able to ascertain that the
Barcoo, Coopers Creek, Strzelecki Creek, Salt Creek,
and Lake Torrens all receive the same flood waters
FRANK T. GREGORY.


flowing into this wide, region from the much wider water-
shed extending from the mountains of north-eastern
Queensland to the Spencer Gulf, making a kind of
system to the west of the Murray system. On June 26
Gregory and his companions reached a cattle station
held by a Mr. Barker, about eight miles beyond Mount
Hopeless, in South Australia.
The expedition had accomplished but little in clearing
up the mystery surrounding the fate of the unfortunate
Dr. Leichhardt, but such was the skill and experience
of Augustus Gregory that it was hardly possible for him
to lead a properly-equipped party of men out into
unknown regions without adding greatly and usefully
to the known geography of the country. The
story of the lost expedition having been mass-
acred at or near the spot where Hely found
their tracks, as told by the natives, was robbed of
whatever credibility previously remained to it by
Gregory’s discoveries, for the latter had demonstrated
the missing party to have jjenetrated at least eighty
miles beyond that point. Others have brought to light
evidence of Leichhardt having advanced further than
the position of the tree found by Gregory, for
Walker, in 1862, found trees certainly marked by
Leichhardt in the same longitude as that met with by
Gregory, but in latitude 22°.
On the completion of his task Gregory wrote the
following interesting summary of its results and of his
views of what he took to be the probabilities surrounding
the fate of Leichhardt and those with him: —“With
reference to the probable fate of Dr. Leichhardt, it is
evident from the existence of the marked camp nearly
eighty miles beyond those seen by Mr. Hely, that the
account given to that gentleman by the natives of the
murder of the party was untrue, and I am inclined to
think only a revival of the report current during Leich-
hardt’s first journey to Port Essington. Ndr is it proo-
able that they were destroyed until they had left the
Victoria, as if killed by the natives the scattered bones
of the horses and cattle would have been observed during
our search. I am, therefore, of opinion that they left
the river at the junction of the Alice and, favoured by
thunder showers, penetrated the level desert country to
the north-west, in which case, on the cessation of the
rain, the party would not only be deprived of a supply
of water for the onward journey, but unable to retreat,
as the shallow deposits of rainwater would evaporate in
a few days, aud it is not likely they would commence
a retrograde movement until the strength of the party
had been severely taxed in the attempt to advance. The
character of the country traversed, from the outstations
on the Dawson River to the head of the Warrego River,
was generally that of a grassy forest, with ridges of
dense brigalow scrub. A great portion is available for
pastoral purposes, but not well watered, and the soil
being sandy the grass would soon be destroyed if too
heavily stocked. As we advanced into the interior it
became more barren, and except along the banks of the
larger watercourses destitute of timber, and the charac-
ter of the vegetation indicated excessive droughts.
North of latitude 26° dense scrubs of acacia prevailed on
the level country beyond the influence of the inunda-
tions, but to the southward sandy and stony desert,
with low scrubby vegetation, were the characteristic
feature. West of longitude 147°, nearly to the boundary
of South Australia, in 141°, the country is unfit for
occupation, for though in favourable seasons there
might in some few localities be abundance of feed for
stock, the uncertainty of rain and frequent recurrence
of drought renders it untenable, the grasses and herbage
being principally annuals, which not only die but are
swept away by the hot summer winds, leaving the sur-
face of the soil completely bare. On Coopers Creek,
near the boundary, there is a small tract of second-rate
country, which, being abundantly supplied with water,
may eventually be occupied. The best part is, however,
within the province of South Australia. Between
Coopers Creek and Lake Torrens about 120 miles of
sandy country intervenes. This tract is destitute of
surface water, but as it is probable that it could be
obtained by sinking wells of moderate depth, I think
it might be occupied to advantage during the cool
season and thus relieve the stations which are now
established within Lake Torrens, though I fear that
the summer heat would be too great to admit of per-
manent occupation. The geological character of the
country is remarkably uniform. Carboniferous sand-
stones and shales, containing occasional beds of coal,
with superincumbent hills and ridges of basalt, extend
irom the Darling Downs to the 146th meridian, where
these rocks are covered by horizontal sandstones with
beds of chert and water-worn quartz pebbles. This
latter formation extends as far as Mount Hopeless,
where the slate ranges of South Australia rise abruptly
from the plain. The sandy deserts and mud plains are
only superficial deposits, as the sandstones are often
exposed where the upper formation is intersected by
gullies. The direction of the parallel ridges of drift
sand appears to be the result of the prevailing winds, and
not the action of water, it being sufficient to visit them
on a windy day to be convinced that it is unnecessary
to seek for a more remote and obscure cause than that
which is at present in operation. It is, perhaps, with
reference to the physical geography of Australia that
the results of the expedition are most important, as by
connecting successively the explorations of Sir Thomas
Mitchell, Mr. Kennedy, Captain Sturt, and Mr. Eyre,
the waters of the tropical interior of the eastern portion
of the Continent are proved to flow toward Spencer


Gulf, if not actually into it, the barometrical observa-
tions showing that Lake Torrens, the lowest part of the
interior, is decidedly above the sea-level. Although
only about one-third of the waters of Coopers Creek
flow into Lake Torrens by the channel of Strzelecki
Creek, there is strong evidence that the remaining chan-
nels, after spreading their waters on the vast plains
which occupy the country between them and Sturt’s
Stony Desert, finally drain to the south, augmented
probably by the waters of Eyre Creek, the Stony Desert,
and perhaps some other watercourses of a similar
character coming from the westward. This peculiar-
structure of the interior renders it improbable that any
considerable inland lake should exist in connection with
the known system of waters, for as Lake Torrens is
decidedly only an expanded continuation of Coopers
Creek, and therefore the culminating point of this vast
system of drainage, if there was sufficient average fall
of rain in the interior to balance the effects of evapora-
tion from the surface of an extensive sheet of water,
the Torrens basin, instead of being occupied by salt
marshes, in which the existence of anything beyond
shallow lagoons of saltwater is yet problematical, would
be maintained as a permanent lake. Therefore, if the
waters flowing from so large a tract of country are
insufficient to meet the evaporation from the surface
of Lake Torrens, there is even less probability of the
waters of the western interior forming an inland lake
of any magnitude, even should there be so anomalous
a feature as a depression of the surface in which it
could be collected, especially as our knowledge of its
limits indicate a much drier climate and less favourable
conformation of surface than in the eastern division of
the Continent. The undulations of the surface of the
country are nearly parallel to the meridian, gradually
decreasing in height from the dividing range between
the eastern and western waters till, instead of the waters
of the rivers being confined to valleys, they occupy
plains formed by a slight flattening of the curvature
of the sphere. Thus the sides of the plain through
which the river ran before it turned west to Coopers
Creek were 150 feet below the tangential level of the
centre channels, and even the summit of the sandstone
tableland which rose beyond was below the visible
horizon. It is this peculiar conformation which causes
the stream beds to spread so widely when following the
course of the valleys from north to south, and it is only
where they break through the intervening ridges that
the water is confined sufficiently to form well-defined
channels. The existence of these extensive valleys,
trending north and south over so large a tract of coun-
try, render it by no means unlikely that they continue
far beyond the limits of present explorations, and it is
not unreasonable to infer that the great depression
which has been traced nearly 500 miles north from
Spencer Gulf through Lake 'Torrens to the Stony Deserl
of Sturt (or, rather, the mud plains contiguous to its
western limit), may be continuous for an equal distance
beyond the low land at the head of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria; a theory also supported by the fact that the
rivers flowing into the Gulf either come from the east
or the west, apparently from higher land in those direc-
tions, while there is not a single watercourse from the
south or any indication of elevated country in that
direction. Captain Wickham, having named an im-
portant river discovered by him in H.M.S. ‘Beagle,’ on
the north-west coast, the ‘Victoria,’ several years prior
to Sir Thomas Mitchell having attached that name to the
upper portion of Coopers Creek, which had also been
previously discovered and named by Captain Sturt, I
would suggest that the term Elver Cooper be adopted
for the whole of the main channel from its sources,
discovered by Sir Thomas Mitchell, to its termination in
Lake Torrens, as while it does not interfere with the
rule that the name given by the first discoverer should
be retained, will prevent the recurrence of the mis-
ajrprehension and inconvenience of having two important
rivers with the same designation on the maps of Aus-
tralia. With regard to the numbers and habits of the
aborigines, I could collect little information, as only a
collective number of about one hundred men, a few
women, and children, were seen in small scattered
parties; but judging from the number of encampments
seen at least one thousand must visit the banks of the
river, and it is probable that the whole of the inhabit-
ants for at least one hundred miles on each side are
dependent on it for water during the dry season.
Neither sex wear any clothing. Their weapons and
utensils are similar to those used on the eastern coast;
nor was there any characteristic by which they could
be observed to differ from the aborigines of other por-
tions of Australia. Fish, rats, grass seeds, and a few
roots constitute their chief food. On the upper part of
the river they bury their dead, piling wood on their
grave; near the junction of the Thomson they suspend
the bodies in nets and afterwards remove the bones;
while on Coopers Creek the graves are mounds of earth
three or four feet high, apparently without any exca-
vation, and surmounted by a pile of dead wood. In
(he last-named locality the number of burial mounds
which had been constructed about two years ago greatly
exceed the proportion of deaths which could have
possibly occurred in any ordinary season of mortality,
even assuming the population to be the densest known
in any part of Australia, and it is not improbable that
the seasons of drought which proved so destructive to
the tree vegetation higher up the river may have been
equally disastrous in its effects on the aboriginal
inhabitants of this portion of the interior.—A. C,
Gregory, Sydney, August 27, 1858.”


CHAPTER XV.
W. O. HODGKINSON.
William Oswald Hodg kinson was in the seventies
and eighties a well-known man in the public life of
Queensland, lie was born at Wandsworth, near Birming-
ham, in 1836, and came to Australia in 1851. When the
Crimean war started he went to London and joined the
Horse Guards, coming back to Victoria in 1859 to
become for a time a reporter on the Aye. In 1860 he
joined the unfortunate Burke and Wills expedition, and
when the rear party were waiting at Menindie he lode
from there to Melbourne and back in twenty days, a
distance of a thousand miles. Had he been in
command of the rear party, instead of Wright,
the calamities of the expedition would probably have
been averted, as he was a sharp, prompt, decisive man,
of great energy. In 1862 he was second in command of
McKinlay’s expedition, which crossed Australia through
far-west Queensland, and finally terminated at Bowen on
August 8, 1862. He was entrusted with all the hardest
work on the triji and was held in much esteem by
McKinlay. He settled in Queensland, and in the
seventies was returned as Member for Burke. In Par-
liament he was a sharp, incisive speaker. He established
and edited a paper at Mackay and one at Rockhampton,
and directed the first quartz mill, the “Lady Marion,” at
Ravenswood. He afterwards became P.M. and Gold
Fields Warden at Cooktown and the Palmer, from 1877
to 1884, ending his days at Petrie Terrace, North Bris-
bane. In 1876 he was appointed leader of an expedition
sent out by the Queensland Government to explore
North-west Queensland from Cloncurry to the South
Australian boundary. The party included, E. A.
Kayser, W . Carr Boyd, Norman McLeod, and an abor-
iginal called “Larry.”
They went from the Cloncurry River, named by
Burke, to Lake Coongi in South Australia, thence by
the western boundary of Queensland to the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, returning by the Cloncurry, Normanton, and
the Flinders. The party left the Cloncurry in April,
1876. On May 12 they crossed the rolling Downs, in sight
of the mountains named Birnie, Aplin, Bruce, Murray
and Merlin, by Robert O Hara Burke. Everywhere the
blacks were numerous, and strict watch was kept through-
out the night. All the party were bushmen, and were
taking no a\oidable chances. On May 16 they were run-
ning down the Diamantina, originally named from
Lady Bowen, wife of our first Governor. They passed
weird hills of red sand, through gidya scrubs, and over
undulating downs, where emus and bustards (the plain
turkey) were very numerous. About the 19th they had
heavy rains in a region where game was abundant, there
being hundreds of black ducks, wood ducks, teal and
crested pigeons.
The party on one occasion suffered much from cold
and hunger, and on June 9 a lot of friendly blacks
presented them with the contents of two clay ovens full
of cooked ‘ wauti,” a root shaped like a radish and tasting
like a sweet potato. The journey here carried them
across spinifex covered sandhills, over flooded creeks and
claypan flats, over open downs, through scrubs of mulga
and gidya, and thickets of poligonum, past
lagoons covered with wild fowl, through tribes of
blacks, the party meanwhile living on portulac,
fish, ducks, pelicans, pigeons and salt beef,
sometimes with food in abundance and at times very
scarce, drenched by heavy rains or weak with the pangs
ol thirst. On July 2 they were among those romantic
lakes discovered by the Burke relief party in 1861, one of
them named Lake Hodgkinson by McKinlay, and the
Gnappcnbarra’ ot the blacks. In periods of drought the
small lakes are dry and produce very fattening pasture,
while others become coated by a noxious slime, which
makes the water unfit for use and kills the fish. Here
I hey saw some of those huge peculiar graves peculiar to
the Far West, and unknown elsewhere, one four feet in
height, ten feet across and eighteen feet in length.
On July 25 they were on the Mulligan River, where
it' was from 200 to bOO yards in width, and found the
aborigines to be “friendly, polite and hospitable.” Two
days before this the thermometer was down to 24, or
eight degrees of frost, with thick ice on the water. In
a lagoon on a branch of the Mulligan, they got ducks,
swans, pelicans and fish in great abundance. Here, too,
they got their first specimens of that remarkable narcotic
plant which grows only on the watershed of the Mulli-
gan. This is the famous “Pitcherie,” classed botanically
as Duboista Hopwoodi, a short squat-bush, growing from
three to seven feet in height. The blacks pick the young
leaves which grow after a grass fire, dry them in the sun
and mixing them witli the ashes of the burnt
leaves of whitewood make a powder which they
chew. Under chemical analysis it is found to
contain a volatile alkaloid, now known as “Pit-
ui me. Tins alkaloid is almost identical with
nicotine, but is very much stronger. Another of the
species, 1). Myoforoides, grows on the coast of Queens-
land and produces an alkaloid called “Duboisine,” which
has the property of dilating the pupil of the eye like the
atropine of belladonna. The blacks sit in a circle, each
taking a brief chew of the pituri, and so on all round to
the first man, who is the last to use it, and in barely an
hour they arc all sound asleep in a semi-stupor.


King, the survivor of the Burke and Wills tragedy,
said a chew of pituri made him forget all Iris hunger and
misery. On the 20th they entered upon what Sturt
called the Stony Desert, later crossing gidya flats, spini-
tex ridges, and travelling through picturesque sandstone
gorges full of rock wallabies. Thence onward they
suffered much from want of water and food, with heavy
travelling over rat-hole and crab-hole country, poli-
gonum and blue bush swamps, but on the 11th they
arrived on well-watered country on the Upper Mulligan,
which they ascended until they reached Mary Lake on
the Georgina River, originally named the “Herbert,”
after the first Queensland Premier, and camped there on
the 26th, having successfully traced the Diamantina to
the border, and traversed from the Cloncurry to Lake
Coongi in South Australia, the journey occupying from
April 13 to September 27, 1876.
The expedition lias an honourable record in Aus-
tralian exploration history, being the only one that
avoided a collision with the aborigines. In after years
Hodgkinson was elected a member of Parliament for
Burke, and hold the position of Secretary for Mines and
Minister for Education in one of the Griffith Ministries,
from August 12, 1800, to March 27, 1893.
CHAPTER XVI.
DALRYMPLE’S EXPLORATIONS.
George Elphinstone Dalrymple was a prominent man
in Queensland for many years and has left an
honoured name for his work as leader of the Government
North Coast Expedition of 1873. At that time very little
was known of the coast north of Townsville, except the
very small settlement of Cardwell on Hinchinbrook
Channel, where it enters Rockingham Bay. Sub-
Inspector Johnstone had found the river which now bears
his name, when he was searching that coast for the
wrecked men from the brig “Maria,” which was lost on
Maria Reef, off Hinchinbrook, when on her way from
Sydney with a party of men going gold hunt-
ing in New Guinea. North from there no other
rivers were known, and there was no Cairns and no
Cooktown. All was wild, unknown country, and even
the hardy adventurous cedar cutters had not ventured
north of Townsville. It was, therefore, a clear field for
the explorer to discover new country, and bestow names
on the rivers and mountains, as north of Cardwell, the
only range then on the chart, was the Bellenden-Ker.
Dalrymple and party left Cardwell on September 20,
1873, in the cutters “Flying Fish” and “Coquette,” with
thirteen white men and a party of thirteen armed
aboriginal troopers, under the command of Sub-Inspector
Johnstone. The “Flying Fish,” of twelve tons,
drew four feet ten inches, and the “Coquette,”
of ten tons, drew three feet six inches. There
was also a native police whale boat, a dingy and a
scow, with complete outfit, abundant stores and scientific
instruments. Among the boatmen was one named Dodd
Clarke, well known in after years as proprietor and
editor of the Townsville “Bulletin.” The botanist was
Walter Hill, first Director of the Brisbane Botanic
Gardens, which he started in 1855.
They were weather bound at Goold Island for nine
days and then started north and anchored at Dunk
Island, named by Cook in 1770, from the Earl of Hali-
fax, whose name was Dunk. On May 26, 1848, the
“Rattlesnake” anchored there and started a coast
survey, which extended six hundred miles. On
the next day Dalrymple named Mount Bartle
Frere, from the then President of the Royal
Geographical Society. It is a vast jungle-covered,
granite mountain, rising 5,000 feet, between the
heads of the Russell and Mulgrave Rivers. He also
named Emeralda Hill and Mount Julia, near the present
Mourilyan Harbour, where Captain Moresby, of H.M.S.
“Basilisk,” had already named Georgia, Hilda, and
Ethel Hills, when surveying on the coast. On October 2
Dalrymple, with Johnstone and five troopers, went up
the Moresby River, which runs into Mourilyan Harbour,
followed by Walter Hill and a Logan River man
named Phillip Henry Mind, who was in search of sugar
land. On October 4he started out to examine the John-
stone River, which runs into the sea six miles north of
Mourilyan.
On that trip he named the Moresby and the Seymour
Ranges, from Captain Moresby, of the “Basilisk,” and
Commissioner of Police Seymour, of Brisbane. He also
named “Gladys Inlet,” where nine of the crew of the
"Maria” were murdered by the blacks. He named Mounts
Annie, Arthur and Maria, in the Seymour, from mem-
bers of Johnstone’s family. Proceeding some distance up
the Johnstone, above the site of the present Innisfail,
they saw some splendid cedar, one tree being ten feet in
diameter. The great area of very rich soil im-
pressed the party and Hill regarded it as “the
most valuable discovery in Australia.” They es-
timated the area of available land at half a
million acres, of which 300,000 were fit for sugar. It


was a remarkably shrewd calculation, and prediction,
though the area was much exaggerated. We know to-day
what a splendid sugar district has arisen on that river
traversed by Hill and Dalrymple in 1873. While camped
on the Johnstone he named the Basilisk and
Walter Hill Ranges. Everywhere the vegetation
was magnificent and gorgeous in its tropical
luxuriance. The party went over to the Frankland
Islands, off the mouth of the Mulgrave, obtaining a
plentiful supply of fish, many Torres Strait pigeons,
and a few cocoanuts from trees self-planted there,
the only cocoanut trees seen on the coast of
Australia. While there Dalrymple named the Graham
and Malbon Thompson Ranges, on the opposite
mainland, and the Bell Peaks, which rise to 3,357
feet and 3,033 feet, named from Sir Joshua Peter Bell.
On October 16 he named the Walsh Pyramid, a granite
mountain, near Cairns (3,050 feet), from the Hon. Wm.
Henry Walsh. He also named Mounts Sheridan, Wil-
liams, and Whitfield, near Cairns, from the Police
Magistrate, Brinsley Sheridan, of Cardwell; F. Y.
Williams, the Lands Commissioner; and E. Whitfield,
a storekeeper, all of Cardwell at that time.
On the 18th Dalrymple was unfortunate in falling on
the hatch of the cutter and breaking one of his ribs.
On October 20 he named Mounts Garioch, Mar, Forman-
tine and Buchan, after four parishes in Aberdeenshire,
Scotland, where he came from. The Macalister Range he
named from the Hon. A. Macalister, Queensland’s second
Premier, afterwards Sir Arthur, who went to London as
Agent-General in 1876. On the way to Schnapper
Island, north of the present Port Douglas, he named
Harris Peak, Mount Beaufort, the Heights of Dagmar
and Alexandria, Thornton Peakes and the Palmer Range.
The best known of these to-day is Mount Alexandria, an
immense double-topped mountain of solid granite, rising
to a height of 4,000 feet, the southern spurs rising from
the north side of the Daintree River, twenty-six miles
north of Port Douglas. On the 24th he named Cape
Kimberley, from the Earl of Kimberley.
Next day, October 25, the party entered Cooktown
Harbour and saw the steamer “Leichhardt,” Captain
Saunders, enter with Howard St. George, P.M., A.
McMillan, a number of officials and 70 diggers bound
for the Palmer diggings. Cooktown then being merely
a collection of white tents under the west side of Cook’s
“Grassy Hill,” a granite and conglomerate hill 600 feet
in height. On October 28 Dalrymple’s party went up
the Endeavour River, but as there was nothing to be
seen except mangroves and crocodiles they came
back to Cooktown, and returned to the Barnard
Group on October 31 in the “Leichhardt,” to wait there
for a suitable vessel from Cardwell, as the “Coquette”
and “Flying Fish” were found to be too small and
uncomfortable. At Cardwell Dalrymple chartered the
schooner "Flirt,” and on November 14 anchored near
Johnstone’s camp on Dunk Island. On November 17
the party consisting of ten whites and ten blacks again
started north. On the 18th they entered the
mouths of the Russell and Mulgrave Rivers,
named on that day by Dalrymple, from the
earls of those names. Both rivers enter the sea
by the one entrance, but a mile inland diverge west
and south-west, one to the right and the other to the left
of the Bellenden-Ker Range. Dalrymple says he went
for eight miles up the Russell and named Harveys Creek,
well known to-day on the railway line from Cairns
towards the Johnstone. On November 21 Dalrymple
started in a whaleboat with Water Hill, Perry, John-
stone and two troopers to ascend the Mulgrave River,
the objective being the climbing of the Bellenden-Ker
Range. On the 25th a party consisting of Hill, John-
stone and eight troopers started through the scrub, evi-
dently towards Mount Teresa.
Dalrymple saw their signal fires on the
“North spur of Bellenden-Ker,” and on November 28
their “smoke on the same spur half way down.” On the
same day they returned in the whaleboat to the mouth
of the river. There is clear evidence that they never
got beyond Mount Sophia, and that the actual summit
of Bellenden-Ker was still two miles away, a thousand
feet above them, and quite inaccessible from that side.
On December 6 they were all on the site of the present
Port Douglas, then called “Island Point,” and on the
same day Dalrymple entered and named the Mossman,
a small river whose mouth is six miles north of Port
Douglas. It was named from the Hugh Mossman who,
with Clarke and Fraser, discovered Charters Towers in
1872. He also entered and named the Daintree
River after the Queensland Agent-General, and Wyan-
beel Point, from the local native name for a canoe.
The party had a friendly interview with the blacks, but
three years afterwards the same tribes killed several
white men. On December 12 they were back at the
Johnstone, and Dalrymple sent Hill and Johnstone up
the river in a whale boat. The blacks appeared on
Coquette Point, painted to look like white men, with
black trousers rolled up to the knees, and artfully
imitated white men’s voices to induce the whites ashore.
Failing to do that they rehearsed the murder of the
Maria men in derision, and made insulting gestures
at the boat party, but they paid a heavy price for that
performance afterwards, when Johnstone and fourteen
troopers got between them and the sea in 1881, when they
had killed one of Fitzgerald’s men. On December 20,
while near one of the Barnard Islands, Johnstone and
his troopers went out to meet a small steamer, the
“Annie” bound for Port Darwin. A few days after-
wards the whole party were disbanded, and Dalrymple
ietuined to Brisbane in the old steamer “Boomerang - ”


CHAPTER XVII.
THE JARDINE BROTHERS’ EXPLORATIONS.
In the history of Australian exploration an honoured
place is held by the Jardine brothers (Frank and Alec),
who in 1864 successfully conducted an expedition from
Rockhampton to the new settlement of Somerset on
Albany Pass, within six miles of Cape York. And they
were the youngest of all the explorers, Frank being born
in 1842 and Alec in 1844, so they were only twenty-two
and twenty years of age when starting on that memorable
tour through wild, unknown country, with unknown
obstacles to overcome. They were the sons of William
Jardine, then Police Magistrate at Rockhampton.
When Sir George Bowen was Governor of Queens-
land, from December 10, 1859, to January 4, 1868, he
decided in 1862 to go on a sea tour
along the east coast, from Brisbane
to Cape York, the real objective
being the discovery of a suitable site
on which to start a northern settle-
ment. He went north in August,
1862, in H.M.S. “Pioneer.” On his
return he suggested Albany Pass, a
narrow passage between Albany
Island and the Cape York mainland.
Albany Island was named in 1846
by Lieutenant Yule, of the “Rattle-
snake.” At that time there was no
mention of Thursday Island. On
his return Governor Bowen sent a
despatch to the Imperial Govern-
ment recommending the Albany
Pass situation, and his advice was
accepted, his reasons being the
advantages of the place on account
of the geographical position and the
suitability as a harbour of refuge,
coaling station, and depot for
the future trade of Torres Strait
and the Pacific Islands.
The work of forming this far off settlement was
entrusted to William Jardine, the Police Magistrate of
Rockhampton, and he went up and erected the first
buildings in 1864, having gone in the barque Eagle,
chartered by the Government, taking also all the neces-
sary material and stores, and accompanied by his
youngest son, John.
While arranging in Rockhampton for the transport
of his staff, materials and stores, he foresaw the future
need of provisions and so proposed to the Government
that he should send his own sous, Frank and
Alec, overland, with a mob of cattle and a
number of horses to the new settlement, which
was to be called Somerset. The Government
promptly accepted the offer and agreed to supply a quali-
fied surveyor, fully equipped, and horses, arms and
accoutrements for four aborigines to accompany the
brothers. A party of ten men, with thirty horses, left
Rockhampton in May, 1864, in charge of Alexander
Jardine, and went by easy stages to Bowen, where they
were joined in July by Frank Jardine and A. J. Richard-
son, the surveyor. Pleuro was then prevalent among
the cattle, and Frank had some difficulty in selecting
suitable stock, but eventually arranged with Mr. William
Stenhouse, of the Clarke River, and the party finally
divided at Reedy Springs on the Burdekin, Alec Jardine
going on ahead with the pack horses
and equipment, leaving Frank, who
was the leader of the whole expedi-
tion, with Scrutton, Cowderoy and
the blackboys to muster and bring
the cattle. Alec started on August
17 and arrived at Carpentaria
Downs station, on the Einasleigh
River, then owned by J. G. Mac-
donald, from whom the party re-
ceived every kindness and assistance.
While waiting for his brother to
arrive Alec decided to exjalore some
of the country ahead, so as to facili-
tate the final start. He was accom-
panied by Henry Bode, a gentle-
man in search of new country, Mr.
Binney and two blackboys.
On September 3 they left Car-
pentaria Downs, Jardine taking
old “Eulah,” a trusted abori-
ginal, who in after years was
speared by the blacks in a
night attack on Jardine’s camp
near Cape York. Bode took his own
blackboy, so the party consisted of two whites, two
blacks, two pack-horses and provisions for three weeks.
At the same time J. G. Macdonald started out north-
west to find country to form a station on the Gulf. Car-
pentaria Downs was situated on what was at first
supposed to be Hie Lynd River of Leichhardt, but was
found to be a tributary of the Gilbert, and was named
the Einasleigh. Jardine ran the river down where it
was running strongly in a width of 200 yards,
crossing at times from one side to the other, with rough
travelling over stony ironbark ridges, naming the New-
castle Range, Plato Creek and Canal Creek, which was
eighty yards wide, with very high steep banks, and so
THE JARDINE BROTHERS.


on through rough country to where they reached Parallel
and Warroul Creeks. Here they found a plant of native
spears, neatly made and barbed with wallaby bones.
On the 7th they saw great flocks of galahs on a creek
running into the Einasleigh, where the junction shows
two remarkable porphyritic rock islands in the river,
which was 300 yards in width.
Following down the river on September 8, after
passing eighty miles of stony ridges and basalt plains,
they emerged on fine, open, well grassed river flats,
lightly timbered, passing a chain of lagoons covered by
black duck, teal, wood duck and pigmy geese, while
pigeons and other game birds were numerous in the
forest, a sure sign of good country. On the lower Einas-
leigh they found the river about three-quarters of a mile
in width, with a dry sandy bed and abundance of water
running a foot under the surface.
The party continued down the Einasleigh for 180
miles, until Jardine was certain it was not the Lynd of
Leichhardt, and so decided to return to Carpentaria
Downs. On September 14 they met wild blacks for the
first time, and also ate the first fruit of the “Nonda” tree
of Leichhardt. They saw blacks fishing with three-
pronged spears, caught some splendid fish and shot ducks
and bustards, being dependent for rations chiefly on what
they shot and caught. After eighteen days’ journey,
over a distance of 360 miles, they were back at Carpen-
taria Downs, finding all well but no sign of Frank Jardine
with the cattle for fifteen more days, when he arrived
with 250 head of bullocks and cows in good condition.
On October 11, 1864, the whole party, which comprised
Frank and Alec Jardine, A. J. Richardson, as surveyor,
C. Scrutton, R. N. Binney, A. Cowderoy and four
blacks—Eulah, Peter, Lambo, and Barney—started
north from Carpentaria Downs. They took pro-
visions estimated to last them four months, and
those consisted of 1,200 pounds of flour, 3 cwt. of
sugar, 35 pounds of tea, 40 pounds of currants and
raisins, 20 pounds of peas and 20 pounds of jams and
salt. Beside those stores were tools, ammunition and
camp requirements, the whole represented by eighteen
packs, averaging 150 pounds each. The four blacks were
armed with the double-barrelled police carbine of that
period, and the whites carried Terry breech-loaders and
Tranter revolvers, which saved their lives on more than
one occasion. They carried only three light tents, more
to protect the stores than as shelter for themselves, as
in dry weather they all slept in the open air. Cowderoy,
Eulah, and Barney started at sunrise with the 250 head
of cattle. The pack-horses did not start before noon,
there being the usual trouble with bucking horses and
thrown packs and broken straps. There were forty-two
head of horses and one or two mules. The horse party
camped at 20 miles, but the cattle had not arrived at the
appointed spot, and the two Jardines went back to look
for them next morning and met them about five miles
up Pluto Creek, which they were running down, Eulah
(the pilot) having lost his bearings and led the party into
the ranges to the eastward. It was the custom for the
cattle party to start about sunrise, the horse party to over-
take them at midday, and then all travel together to
where they camped in the evening. At each camp Frank
Jardine cut his initials in a tree and the number of his
camp. This was the practice of all the explorers. At
times the country was so rough they only travelled ten
to twelve miles in the day. On October 14 the course
was over stony quartz and granite ridges, which ran into
the river and could not be avoided, the bed of the creek
itself being filled by large boulders. The timber on the
ridges consisted chiefly of stunted hollow ironbark, with
bloodwood and apple gum along the creek.
On October 15 they camped at Cawana Swamp, a
beautiful spot, partly surrounded by Jorgensens Range
on the north and east, and on the south and east by walls
of cellular basalt. The swamp was six miles in circum-
ference and so shallow that the cattle fed out near the
middle. Next day, the 16th, still running down the
Einasleigh river, they struck rough country, the basalt
laming the cattle and wrenching the heads off the
horseshoe nails. They got a native companion, a rock
wallaby and a red kangaroo, thereby avoiding the neces-
sity ul killing a beast, and preventing the delay which
would have been inconvenient as the blacks had burnt
all the grass and there was not a bite of feed for horses
or cattle. From here onwards they were fol-
lowed by blacks north beyond the Archer River,
and messengers would be sent on, or smoke
signals made, to warn all the blacks ahead to be on
the lookout for these white men, who were going as they
pleased, and doing as they pleased, in defiance of all
aboriginal laws. The Jardine party had good reason to
know all this in after days. On October 17, on Parallel
Creek, they took six hours to travel over three and a
half miles, the only path being the bed of the creek,
which was crossed at short distances by bars of granite
boulders, twenty to thirty feet high. The cows at
this stage started calving, and as the calves had to be
killed the mothers rambled back in the night to seek for
them, and one went so far that they left her there. The
party camped that night in the bed of the creek, hemmed
by a basalt wall 80 feet in height. Next day they had
villainous country, lost one horse and a bull, and several
cattle were tired out.. They saw a great number of blacks,
and at a waterhole came on a fishing party, who fled and
left all their weapons, including woomera spears and a
very large stone tomahawk. Next day they were
on the river itself, where it was 700 yards wide
with large waterholes and plenty of fish. At a
'darks’ fire they found the roasted remains «f
an aboriginal, the head and thigh bones only complete,


the rest of the body broken up, and the skull full
of blood. This may have been a black killed by accident
or in a row, or for infringing some tribal law.
On October 21, being in good country with jilenty
of grass, Frank decided to camp for a few days to recruit
his cattle and horses, having come 120 miles from Car-
pentaria Downs, an average of ten miles per day. Mere
Frank and Alec went off to find the Lynd River of
Leichhardt, being assured by Richardson that it must be
about ten miles north-east. At this stage there was a
serious difference of opinion between Frank Jardine and
Richardson with regard to the latitude of the Lynd, and
thence onward the brothers evidently had not much faith
in the surveyor. As a question of fact they never saw
the Lynd at all, being too
far to the westward and
south-west.
During the brothers’
hurried trip in search of
the Lynd they found a
stream they called the
Byerly, which runs south-
west into the Gilbert.
Frank knew it was not the
Lynd as the country failed
to correspond in any way
with Leichhardt’s descrip-
tion of that river. They
all started again on Novem-
ber 4, losing two horses from
snake bite, and next day
sixteen horses were missing.
The brothers went on with
the cattle, leaving a party
to bring on the horses, and
were exceedingly anxious for
three nights over the non-
arrival of the rear party,
the worry being increased
on November 8 by the
shortage of twenty or thirty cattle. On the 9th
Alec started back to look for the rearguard and met
them coming on with specially bad news of a calamity for
which somebody’s gross carelessness must have been
responsible. On November 5, the day on which the
brothers had started with the cattle, a grass fire had
caught the camp, destroyed six 70 lb. bags of flour,
all the tea except ten pounds, one hundred pounds of
rice, jam, apples, and currants, five pounds of powder,
twelve pounds of shot, a box of cartridges and caps, two
tents, a packsaddle, twenty-two packbags, fourteen
surcingles, twelve leather girths, six breechings, thirty
ringpack straps, two bridles, two pairs blankets, two pairs
of boots, nearly all the clothes of the blackboys and (he
Jardines, and two bags of awls, needles, twine and other
nicknacks. That lire nearly stopped the expedition, for
had all their powder gone they dared not have faced the
rest of the journey. It appears that Scrutton saved
some of the powder from the fire when the solder was
actually melting on the outside of the canister. The
brothers went ahead to look for a route for the cattle,
travelled twenty-live miles west, down Maramie Creek,
then eight miles south to where they struck the Staaten,
named at the mouth by the old Dutch navigators in 1623,
the first river named in Australia, or 147 years before
Captain Cook. On the Staaten the Jardines were
attacked by blacks, among whom there were doubtless
men who were present at the attack on Leichhardt’s party
when Gilbert, the naturalist,
was killed on the night of
June 28, 1845, or nineteen
years before the Jardines.
They were again attacked
by the blacks on the 20th,
and probably no other Aus-
tralian explorers experi-
enced so much trouble in
this respect as did the Jar-
dines.
Next Day Frank was
attacked when alone and had
tc shoot two of the Myalls.
The party had endless
trouble with straying horses
and lost cattle, poor grass
and scarcity of provisions.
They had the same trouble
with kites and crows as
Leichhardt in the same
locality in 1845, hundreds
of these birds hovering
round, actually snatching
the roasting meat from the
fire. The blacks were heard
cooeeing all night around the camp. On November 27
Frank had a very narrow escape from a spear and shot
the man who threw it. The rest of the party were
attacked, several blacks being shot and others carried
away wounded. This meant that all blacks ahead on their
route would be advised and be prepared with a hostile
reception. So they continued on down the Staaten
through very miserable country, satisfied at last they had
missed the Lynd and were far too much to the west.
On December 5 they left the Staaten and started north
at last, across waterless country, poorly grassed, losing
some horses, including one or two that went mad. The
mule was lost carrying a valuable pack. They crossed
extensive marine plains, covered with native companions,
J. G. MACDONALD


jabirus, pelicans and ibis; the lagoons swarming with
ducks, a perfect paradise of game. On the 16th they
struck the Mitchell of Leichhardt, in three channels
with a total width of 600 yards, the banks and islands
covered by thick vine scrub and lined by plum, chestnut,
nouda, flooded gums, tea-trees, and graceful jam-leaved
palms. Leichhardt had struck this river ten miles
higher where he reported it a mile and a half in width.
On December 18 came the “battle of the Mitchell,”
probably one of the severest contests in Australian
history between whites and the aborigines, and one of
the rare occasions when blacks have stood and faced men
with rifles. They came suddenly on a lot of blacks fishing,
but these crossed the river and swam back carrying
bundles of woomera spears. The horsemen cantered
back to camp and the blacks pursued them with spears,
which were coming so near that the two Jardines and
Eulah turned and galloped towards them, the firing
bringing all their mates from the camp and shooting
became promiscuous. The blacks finally all huddled
in a body close to the water, apparently terror-stricken
at the noise of ten rifles, which at that short distance
were used with such deadly effect, that when Frank
called off his men there were over fifty dead blacks,
besides some who were probably fatally wounded or
drowned. The Mitchell showed traces of heavy
floods, and had the party been caught among
the branches of that river by the wet season,
the exjredition would have ended there, for they
would never have got a horse or bullock through alive,
and their own fate would have been very doubtful. On
December 21 another lot of blacks, on the third day
after the “battle,” attempted to stalk them behind green
bushes, but the two Jardines, Scrutton, and the four
blackboys chased them on foot for over a mile, until they
vanished in thick scrub.
Finally on December 22 they left the Mitchell, which
was crossed at about forty miles from the sea, instead
of a hundred miles higher, towards the watershed, and
started' on a line for Cape York. A lot of worthless
country was passed over from the Mitchell to Holroyd
Creek, next to which was a creek they named the
Thalia, a salt stream, proving that they were still far
too much to the westward. Here one of their blackboys
was chased to the camp by the blacks, who were promptly
pursued and a number shot, some of them big men over
six feet. The next creek was named Macleod, where they
had a terrific storm, and as it was all low country, subject
to heavy floods, they were very anxious to get out of it
as soon as possible. On January 4 they found and
named the Archer River, in honour of the Gracemere
Archers, a large sandy river flowing through a valley
of great richness and beauty, considered by the Jardines
to be the best cattle country they had seen north of
Broad sound.
From there on they had some execrable country and
lost both horses and cattle, bogged in a rotten tea-tree flat,
before they reached the Batavia River, on January 11,
a flooded creek, twenty-five yards wide, running very
rapidly, fringed by thick scrub. This must have been
about where the present overland line crosses at the
Moreton telegraph station. In the dry season it is a
stream of very clear and excellent water, running over
pure white sand. Two horses and a bullock were drowned
while crossing and three of the party had a narrow
escape. This was a fatal spot for the expedition as twelve
of their horses were poisoned here, evidently from eating
young shoots of the deadly poisonous iron wood, which is
everywhere on the Batavia River. Frank in his diary,
camp 67, marked that day as “Black Thurs-
day.” From here they had terrible country to
travel over, the wet season was starting, and
perpetual vigilance was required as the blacks
hung on their rear and watched them through the whole
journey. The final attack was on January 14,
two days north of the Batavia, when two shots were
fired killing two blacks and putting the rest to flight.
At this time the two Jardines, Scrutton, Binney, and
the four blacks were wearing only their shirts
and belts, being bare-focted and bare-legged, with caps
of opossum skin; and that comprised their outfit for
250 miles.
On January 17 they arrived at what is now the
Skardon River, a small stream north of the Ducie River
and seventy miles south of Cape York, they were nearing
Somerset, but were to experience a terrible time before
they saw the new settlement. Most of their best horses
were dead and they had to leave some things behind to
lighten the packs. They were without beef as they could
not carry it without sacrificing some of their packs, and
tea and sugar had been finished for weeks. Two horses
died at the Skardon and two police saddles were left
there. On January 18 they killed a knocked-up foal and
cooked and ate it. At this time they were bearing north-
east to what they called the Richardson Range, behind
Shelburne Bay, and had a sight of the sea. Here they
were entangled in thick vine scrubs on the head of what
is now the Jardine River, which they followed to the
junction of a stream they called the McHenry, a branch
of the Jardine, which Frank took to be the head of the
Escape River, which runs east into Newcastle Bay, but
he saw his mistake when the river continued running to
the north-west. There was evidently something wrong
with surveyor Richardson or his instruments, as lie
plotted camp 82 as on the Escape River and sixteen miles
from Somerset, whereas they were on the Jardine River,
running in an exactly opposite direction from the Escape.
On the 30th the Jardines and Eulali, with a
week’s provisions, started to find Somerset. They went
down the Jardine River to make sure it was not the


Escape and finally returned to the main camp, Frank
decided to cross the river, and all got safely over with
the aid of a raft, and camped on the north side, where
the two brothers left the cattle in charge of Scrutton, to
stay there until they could locate Somerset. They went
north-east until they saw Newcastle Bay and Mount
Adolphus Island, eventually striking the real Escape
River, which was flooded and ran through abominable
country, and was bordered by a two mile wide fringe of
impassable mangrove. They followed
up the river with their horses so tired
out they had to be driven on foot,
the men living chiefly on scrub
turkey eggs until they once more
reached the main camp. Finally, on
the crest of a small hill, they saw
their exact position, and next day,
March 1, they came to a party of
friendly blacks who were very
excited and called out the “Franks,”
“Aliko,” and various other words
they had been taught by Jardine
senior, at Somerset, who told
them to keep a look-out for the
two brothers and pilot them in
to the settlement. Next day, at
noon, guided by three of the
blacks, they arrived at Somerset,
and once more met their father,
after an absence of ten months
and a journey of 1,600 miles. Their feet were in green-
hide mocassins, they wore caps of emu feathers, had only
the waistbands and pockets of their trousers left and
were tanned to a dark brown. After getting some fresh
horses they searched for a suitable spot for the cattle and
fixed on Point Vallack, three miles from Somerset. On
March 5 they started with black guides, accompanied by
the younger brother, John, to return to the party with
the cattle and bring them on to Point Vallack.
Thus ended one of the most remarkable expeditions
in Australian history, one in which the party suffered
more hardships, encountered more difficulties and faced
more continuous dangers than nearly all the other
explorers combined, and we can have nothing less than
boundless admiration for the splendid courage, the cheer-
ful philosophic endurance, the marvellous faculty of
adaptation, and the high intelligence
of those two youths of twenty-two
and twenty, who finally arrived at
Somerset, through incredible difficul-
ties, without the loss of one man,
serious injury to any of the party,
or even a day’s delay by sickness.
They were hardy and determined
youths, with the blood of the old
fighting Jardines of the Border clans
in their veins.
Frank and Alec returned with
their father to Brisbane, leaving
young John, the brother, in charge
of the cattle station at Point Yah
lack. Frank returned to Somerset
and remained there until his death,
in the year 1919, at the age of
seventy-seven. All ships passing
Somerset, through Albany Pass,
always dijrped their flags in token
of respect for the old explorer.
The brother, Alexander (Alec), remained in the
south and became a qualified surveyor and engineer,
doing much land survey work for the Government, and
was for some years Engineer of Harbours and Rivers.
Alee is the sole surviving son of the Jardine family,
and the last of all the old Australian explorers.
WILLIAM MANN.
William Hann, the North Queensland explorer of
1872, was one of two brothers who at one time owned
Lawn Hill Station on the Gulf and were well-known
squatters. Frank in after years went to West Australia
and did some exploratory work there and in the Northern
Territory. William Hann is prominent in Queensland
history as the discoverer of the Palmer, the richest allu-
vial goldfield so far found in Australia, and in a wider

sense, in the world. He was sent out as leader of a
prospecting and exploring expedition by the Palmer
Ministry in 1872; Iris party including Taylor, as geolo-
gist; Dr. Tate, as botanist; Warner, as surveyor;
Stewart, Nation and Jerry (an aboriginal).
Taking 25 pack and saddle horses. 20 sheep,
and five months’ provisions, the party left Fossil-
brook Station on June 26, 1872, following


Fossilbrook Creek to the Lynd, and thence to the
Kirchner Range, where Hann lost his prismatic com-
pass. They prospected in many places on the Lynd for
five days, leaving there on July 3, and two days after-
wards they arrived at a river which Hann named the
“Tate,” in honour of his botanist. On July 9 he dis-
covered and named Walsh River, from the Hon. Wm.
Henry Walsh, then Minister of Works. On the bank of
this river, in a limestone formation, he found a large
bed of fossils, many beautifully perfect, and in quantity
sufficient to load a dray. Among them were several
vertebrae of a huge animal, apparently diprotodon,
whose fossils w r ere first found on Kings Creek, on the
Darling Downs, in 1842. They crossed and named Eliza-
beth and Louisa Creeks and went down to the junction
of the Lynd and Mitchell, two rivers found and named
by Leichhardt, in his overland journey from Brisbane
to Port Essington in 1845.
On July 27 they followed up the Mitchell,
crossed eight miles of basaltic country, evidently
the source of the agates in the bed of the
river, across two miles of limestone, and three miles
of slate, naming Taylors Carboniferous Range, Warner
Range, Warner Peaks and Mount Lilley (from a one
time Queensland Premier, and afterwards Chief Justice).
They followed the Mitchell for 45 miles, and then
turned north, naming Mount Mulgrave, Garnet Creek
and Mount Daintree. In his diary here, Hann records
that, “from the summit of Mount Daintree a large river
was seen due north, about three miles from the camp,
probably the ‘Ninety Yards AVide Creek,’ of Kennedy in
1848,” though it is very doubtful if Kennedy went so
far west as the Palmer, the famous river which Hann
named from the Premier (Arthur Palmer), afterwards
Sir Arthur Palmer, then Chief Secretary of Queensland.
This was the river destined in the following year to be
the scene of a gold rush, which attracted ten thousand
white men and from ten to fifteen thousand Chinese, and
provided nameless graves for hundreds of men who
went down under bad water, poor food, Palmer
fever, or the spears of the blacks. In this river Warner
found scaly gold of a rich colour, in a granite formation,
and claimed the reward of half a pound of tobacco, offered
by Hann for the first gold discovered. The site of this
discovery was promptly named “Warner’s Gully,” and
it became memorable in the after-history of the Palmer,
like the Nash Gully in Gympie, where Nash discovered
his first gold in October, 1867.
Further prospecting was not successful, but Hann
firmly believed there was payable gold in that country.
On August 21 he went north and found and
named the Coleman River, which runs into the
Gulf, following it up for seventeen miles, to
where he had a friendly interview with a band
of higher type blacks and gave them some fish
hooks. Those Mitchell and Coleman tribes had been
deadly foes of the Jardines in their expedition of 1864,
only twelve years before Hann, but evidently Hann
adopted “milder methods and was on friendly terms with
the wild children of the forest. Guided by the cone of
Mount Newberry in the distance, the party reached the
divide of the Peninsula, where the waters run west to
the Gulf, and east to Princess Charlotte Bay. They
struck the head of what Hann called the Stewart River,
after one of his party, and followed it down to where it
runs into the north jjart of Princess Charlotte Bay. The
mouth of that river in after years became the depot where
stores and diggers were landed from Cooktown for
Ebagoolah and the Coen goldfields.
So far the trip, according to Hann, had been one
of pleasure and easy travelling, kangaroos, fish, the Nada
fruit of Leichhardt and wild honey providing plenteous
supplies. On September 6 they left the Stewart and
steered south-west for the Kennedy, the country on each
side being open forest and poor soil plains, evidently
liable to heavy floods. On the 12th they arrived
at a wide running river, which Hann called the
Normanby, from the Marquis of Normanby, then
Governor of Queensland. On their way there they had
crossed an extensive tract of wretched flooded country,
and great swamps, covered by geese and ducks. They
met many natives, who were all friendly, until Tate
foolishly picked up a small blackboy and brought him
into camp, the result next day being a hostile demon-
stration by a large mob of blacks, and serious trouble
was only averted by promptly returning the boy.
On September 21 Hann reached a creek where he
saw the first river oaks (Casuarina) since leaving Fossil-
brook, and he called it Oaky Creek, destined to be
memorable afterwards in the history of the Palmer. From
this creek he went to the Endeavour River, and followed
that river down to the coast on the present site of Cook-
town. On September 25 Hann started up the Endeavour
for thirty miles, and then turned due south, apparently
towards the head of the Annan, finally turning eastward
through very rough country and dense lawyer cane
jungle, until they reached the coast at the mouth of the
Bloomfield River, which runs into Cook’s Weary Bay,
twenty-six miles south of Cooktown. In following up
this river they became entangled in the dense scrub
which covers all that region, and were struggling in it
for ten days, until they wisely went back over the range
and emerged in open forest at their sixty-fourth camp on
October 12.


On the 18th they crossed some “wretched country
of bare slate ridges” on a branch of the Normanby, where
Hann named “Andrews Range,” from Tate’s friend, lost
in the Maria,” and on October 28 they were back on
the Palmer, the Mitchell on October 31, the Tate on
November 6, the Lynd on Novmber 9, and on November
12 arrived at Junction Creek, all well and their journey
ended. With the exception of the unpleasant ten days
in the scrubs of the Bloomfield River, Hann’s party had
possibly the most pleasant time of all the explorers,
being in open country with mostly fine weather,
and abundance of game and fish and moreover
the trip produced very important results. In
August of the next year,
1873, J. Y. Mulligan and
party, guided by Hann’s
report were on the Palmer
prospecting, and on Septem-
ber 5 Mulligan went into
Georgetown with 102 ounces
of ‘ ‘shotty, water-worn
gold.” In the first four
years the Palmer gave
840,000 ounces of gold.
William Hann was
drowned one morning while
bathing on the beach at
Townsville, in front of the
hotel, heart trouble being
the cause.
Space alone prevents
our dealing with the explor-
ations of Charles Fraser, the
Colonial Botanist of New
South Wales, who was sent
to Moreton Bay in 1828 with
instructions to “establish a
public garden, to collect the
vegetable products of the
country, to make observa-
tions on their uses and importance, especially the forest
trees, to report on the nature of the soil and to what
extent it is fitted for grazing or agriculture.” Hoven-
den Hely, the leader of a party sent out to endeavour to
determine the fate of Leichhardt in 1852; J. G. Mac-
donald, one of the pioneer squatters of Northern Queens-
land who led an exploring expedition to the rivers
running to the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1864; Ernest
Favenc, who headed a very successful expedition from
Brisbane to Port Darwin in 1878; and the exploring
vessels “Beagle,” “Fly” and “Rattlesnake” of the
forties. The “Beagle” in command of Captain Wick-
ham, the “Fly” under Captain Blackwood and the
“Rattlesnake” in charge of Captain Owen Stanley did
much to explore the east coast of Australia and particu-
larly the area now included in Queensland.
In tracing the history of the exploration of this
State the difficulties of pioneering are brought vividly
before us and throughout the whole of the expeditions
that devotion to duty which is one of the characteristics
of our race has been dis-
played under the most try-
ing circumstances. Austra-
lians do not adequately
conceive the nobleness of
their “Island Story”—all
that romantic setting which
stirs the popular fancy is
missing—the story of travel
over trackless wastes,
through forests and over
unknown rivers, tributaries
and lagoons; of the dangers
of flood, the treachery of
savages and the facing of
that most terrible of all
deaths—thirst—as told by
men who have calmly and
unmovedly performed the
duty upon which they set
out, will perhaps scarcely
appeal to those of our time.
But reading the story we can
learn to realize the indomit-
able courage and persever-
ance and the singleness of
purpose which characterized
their efforts, which have meant so much in opening up
this vast State. For the mistakes and failures of the
past we of the present are in no way to blame, but let
us now use our endeavours so that in future the glorious
story of Australian exploration will be given a place in
our literature and be taught in our schools as a heritage
of which we should be justly proud.

The Pastoral Industry.
(Continued from Vol. II, page 158)
EVOLUTION OF TYPES OF STOCK.
CHAPTER III.
Among the first to attract attention with locally-
evolved stud sheep were the Tasmanians. In the Island
State all the conditions favoured stud breeding. The mid-
lands district of that Colony was noted for producing a
very high quality wool. Tire holdings were relatively
small, and for that reason enabled the squatter to
devote more attention and labour upon a small and
specially-selected breeding flock than was possible over
most of the pastoral areas of the mainland. Moreover,
the men who became early involved in grazing in that
region happened to be born with the characteristics
needed by the husbandman who successfully changes the
traits of a flock or herd by the selection of sires and
dams and the judicious mating of them. The Tas-
manian breeders obtained a high reputation among
pastoralists of Victoria and New South Wales, and
Tasmanian rams sold for hundreds of guineas
each. These sheep probably suited the western district
of Victoria, as well as they did the pleasant runs of the
Island, for very similar natural conditions prevailed in
the two places. But they had not been bred to suit
the heat and rough aridity of New South Wales. Even
less adapted were they to the still more trying environ-
ment prevailing in Queensland. Furthermore, these sheep
were mostly prepared for sale under artificial conditions,
fed on English grasses, housed at nights, and kept in
tiny paddocks constructed for only three or four
animals. A stud ram being bought by a mainlander
would still be pampered, for having paid a high price
the owner would take no risks of losing his purchase.
But the progeny would prove quite unlike the sire,
because they would be treated in a way so completely
different. They would shear less wool and would grow
smaller in frame. The breeders were producing a type,
not for a practical wool-growing objective, but to suit
the prevailing demand of the market. At first the
Tasmanian sheep were not noted so much for the density
of the fleeces as for the super-quality of the wool. It
is doubtful if a more beautiful type of lustrous, silk-
like fibre of great character and considerable body has
ever been produced in any part of Australia than that
which characterized some of the Tasmanian sheep about
the seventies and eighties. But this was not the type
to withstand the difficulties of life in the torrid
North, where a stronger fibre was needed and a
vigorous constitution essential. Yet being so
largely bought by Victorians and New South
Welshmen, this Tasmanian blood filtered through nearly
all the flocks of the Eastern States. In some cases they
added to the fleeces and improved the quality of the
wool in those mainland districts naturally suited for
producing high-class fleeces. But they were not the
type most suited to produce the best results in the
arid interior and the sunbaked North.
In the nineties the Tasmanian stud breeders met
with a keen opposition from breeders in Vermont, in
the United States. At that time the Tasmanians had
considerably increased the density of the fleeces on their
sheep, and they were developing folds of skin on the
bodies, so that the wool-growing surface was increased.
“President,” a Tasmanian-bred sire, sold by public
auction for 1,600 guineas, was thickly packed with
wrinkles and carried a very dense fleece; but he was not
large of frame and he would not have been able to
withstand conditions, of drought under practical pastoral
conditions, though his pfogeny, bearing the sire’s
characteristics in but a modified form, wou have been
more suitable for practical requirements. “Presi-
dent” was typical of the Tasmanian sale stud type of
that time.
The Vermont sheep were more heavily laden with
body wrinkles of skin than were the Tasmanians. Of
the best Americans, the fleeces probably weighed heavier
than those from the Tasmanian, one ram, which had
been imported from the United States, and was awarded
a first prize at the Melbourne Sheep Show, yielding
wool which turned the scales at forty pounds. But the
American sheep carried a larger proportion of fatty
solids than did those from the Island State.
Moreover, whereas the latter had been changed


to the wrinkled type within a few years, the former had
been bred true to type for many generations, and
therefore their characteristics were more strongly
implanted into their progeny when they were mated
with ordinary Australian ewes. The Vermont sheep
soon began to attract the attention and desires of
fully 90 per cent, of the purchasers who attended the
annual stud sheep auction sales at Sydney and Mel-
bourne, whilst for some years nearly all the prizes at
the annual sheep shows at those two cities were awarded
to American-bred sheep. The Tasmanians met this
opposition by evolving their studs so as to make them
resemble the imported sheep as closely as possible, and in
doing this they were wonderfully successful. Studs
which two decades before had been composed of sheep
were the two sets of traits respectively characterizing
them. The whole appearance had been changed.
So keen was the demand for the American sheep
that but few Australian flocks escaped a direct or
indirect introduction of their blood. The Vermonts
were small-bodied sheep, and it was apparent from the
first that the wethers from a “Vermontized” flock would
not command prices so high as were obtained for the
larger-framed, plainer-bodied Australian merinos. But
wool-growers, for the most part, felt confident that the
thickening ujj of the fleeces which they anticipated to
result from an introduction of the new blood would more
than compensate for some loss of money in the disposal
of surplus stock. The denser fleeces, they calculated,
would not only more rapidly fill the bales, but the
WARREN STATE FARM.
with no body wrinkles, , and in many cases devoid of
folds on the neck, came to look like a different variety,
so closely were they packed with convolutions of skin
and so much denser had the fleeces become. This was
done without the importation of Americans by a process
of selection and rejection. It provided a remark-
ably convincing demonstration of how speedily and
thoroughly radical changes of type may be produced
by the skilful breeder aiming at a distinct
ideal and knowing how to attain the required
end. “Sir Thomas” was a sheep of the old plain-
bodied stamp, and when sold he brought a record price.
He was typical, just as “President” was typical of the
later characteristics. Photographs of the two sheep
show that nothing could be more widely divergent than
greater number of fibres to every square inch of skin
surface would present a more solid tip, and in that way
would more effectively keep out the dust, which in many
localities does much to deteriorate the value of clips.
In the case of flocks woolled lightly with open fleeces
an increase in quantity no doubt resulted, though it
has never been shown that the same results in this
direction might not have been attained by the use of
rams of types which were being produced on the main-
land of our own Continent. In the great majority of
instances the results accruing from the importation of
this blood from the United States proved disappointing
in the extreme. Where heavily-wrinkled Tasmanian
sheep might be used without an excess of wrinkle
appearing in the progeny, the Vermonts had been bred


true to type for so long that the characteristics were
transmitted with great regularity to offspring. This, of
course, led to the flock sheep becoming heavily wrinkled
on the bodies, as well as small of frame. The wrinkles
on the bodies of the flock sheep proved, not a merit, but
a fault. The wool between the folds of skin was inferior
in quality, and the staple was too short. Moreover, the
density which had so conspicuously stamped the highly-
fed stud sheep, that had been pampered in every way
calculated to add to the attractiveness of appearance,
largely disappeared. When the dust obtained entry to
the short fleeces very little clean wool remained. A
fleece of lengthy fibre might carry a considerable depth
of dust-laden tip, and still show good length of clean
wool to the skin. The fatty matter in the fleeces was ex-
cessive, and the additional weight, added to that of a
heavily-corrugated skin, created difficulties in the way
of travelling the distances to and from water sometimes
rendered necessary by long spells of dry weather in the
interior of this Continent. The wrinkles also at times
prevented the lambs from finding the teats of their
dams, and the lambing percentage was thus diminished.
On top of these disadvantages was the fact that the
American sheep were never noted for a good quality of
fleece, and their introduction into Australia for some
years undoubtedly deteriorated the average value of the
whole Australian clip—short, dusty yellow wool prevail-
ing to an extent which had not before occurred. Such
was the result of the heavy importations of the Ver-
monts, with the exceptions of a few studs in New South
Wales, where they were used very sparingly and with
great judgment. In the latter cases an increase of
density was obtained without the other American
characteristics being allowed to creep into the progeny.
THE AUSTRALIAN MERINO.
Of course, reaction followed. The demand for
American sheep died away to vanishing point, and with
the unpopularity of the imported type there developed
similar suspicion of the Tasmanian sheep which had
been evolved to resemble it so closely. A very
different kind of sheep came into favour, this
being the strain of blood known as the “Australian
Merino,” a large-framed sheep, plain of body, but
bearing large, deep folds of skin on the neck and a wide
thigh. The “Australian Merino” carries a bright fleece
of long staple, the fibre being strong, well serrated, free
from excessive grease, and as dense as is consistent with
the maintenance of good length. While the rage per-
sisted for Tasmanian and American sheep, skilled
breeders in the Riverina district of New South Wales
persisted in aiming at an ideal, distinct and very different
from that actuating so many of the other pastoralists of
the Continent, for they were improving and developing
the “Australian Merino.” At that time these sheep
were not being' exhibited at the shows of the capital
cities, and if they had been prizes would not have gone
their way, for the characteristics were not popular.
Neither did the breeders seek the publicity of the annual
auction sales, but nevertheless, the sale of their rams
went on steadily and remuneratively, and each year
some thousands of flock rams were sold. All the buyers
who felt suspicious of the results of using the small,
heavily-wrinkled sheep were buying “Australian
Merinos’ ’ from the Riverina. It is true that some of
the flocks in South Australia were kept large in frame
and pure in blood, but they were not quite the type
needed for difficult conditions of life in the North. The
tide has now turned entirely in favour of the “Austra-
lian Merino.”
The merits of this type appear so obvious that the
wool-grower of to-day wonders why they did not come
in for general recognition many years earlier. The
rams, though not bred in the heat of Queensland, are
at least subject to entirely natural conditions on the
plains of New South Wales, where droughts are some-
times as severe and the heat is nearly as intense as it is
over most of the pastoral districts of the more northerly
State. For the vendor to refrain from artificially
feeding and otherwise pampering his sale rams denotes
a point of great importance in favour of the buyer. The
latter knows what he is obtaining. The faults of his
purchase are not hidden by skilful “getting up,” only
to become apparent as soon as the sire or his stock are
subject to practical pastoral conditions. The purchaser,
if he buys with any degree of skilled judgment, at
least may know that he is obtaining rams with strength
of constitution. And he sees just such fleeces as the
bought sires may be expected to yield, and which he
has every reason to suppose their progeny will inherit.
Moreover, experience has demonstrated that on big
stations, where the strain is pure and the flock
has been managed with normal skill, “Australian
Merinos” will return a heavier clip of scoured wool and
of higher total cash value than will any other type.
The latter fact, in a nutshell, accounts for the complete
swing of the pendulum of public opinion in favour of
the type which is the product of the interior of the
Continent, which has been evolved without introduction
of alien blood, by the consistent and well-directed
method of selection and rejection. The type is more
firmly fixed than is that of the Tasmanian sheep, because
although the Tasmanian studs have been in existence
longer, and are as pure in blood, their type has been
so revolutionized that the traits are not strongly fixed,
and wherever the influences of atavism come into opera-
tion, divergence from the common standard becomes
manifest. But the “Australian Merino” has been bred
consistently true to type since the Riverina country
first attracted the attention of the wool-growers, and

the distinctive traits have been the more firmly im-
planted by well-regulated and carefully-applied inbreed-
ing, the latter being a method about which much
incorrect popular prejudice exists.
Developments occurring in the world’s meat
market since 1913 have given a degree of value to large-
framed, plain-bodied sheep greater than was counted on
in earlier days. When America, by changing from a
meat-exporting to a meat-importing country, gave a
new scale of values to the cattle-raising industry of
Australia, so did she render secure and increase the
value of surplus stock from sheep stations. A normal
breeding flock, on settled and fully-stocked country,
should show a general natural increase of 20 per cent.,
so that sheep in that quantity must annually be sold to
make room for the younger ages which are coming on.
The sale of wethers and aged ewes, therefore, forms an
important avenue of revenue to the wool-grower, and as
prices for meat increase so do his returns from this
source become larger. His first consideration is that his
flock should return wool of maximum quantity and the
highest quality to which the country is capable of pro-
ducing. But it is also important that his surplus stock
should possess the constitutions and frames which lend
themselves readily to fattening. No type of merino is
harder to fatten than the small, heavily-wrinkled
variety, and none easier than the big, plain-bodied
sheep. The latter consideration will help to ensure the
continuance of the popularity of the “Australian
Merino” throughout the Eastern States, and particu-
larly in Queensland.
The following table shows the extension of the
sheep-breeding industry in Queensland since 1860:
The figures for 1914 show that just before the
commencement of the drought, which opened with 1915,
Queensland, besides containing 22,977,996 sheep, de-
pastured 5,369,741 head of cattle and 734,912 horses.
In this State were more horses than in any other of
the Commonwealth, and the number of cattle represented
nearly 50 per cent, of the grand total of all the States.
The expansion of the cattle-raising industry is
indicated as follows :
The meat-export industry of Queensland has
increased at a rate even higher than the number of
cattle depastured in the State.
The drought of 1915 proved the main cause in
reducing the number of live stock for that year. There
was in Queensland a decrease of 55,288 horses,
7,179,765 sheep, and 675,050 head of cattle.
Although some big fortunes have been made within
short spaces of time by sheep and cattle graziers in
Queensland, the State nevertheless has proved the grave
of many hopes. In no other part of the Commonwealth
have holdings of such area of good land been available to
the squatter, but the pests and difficulties have cor-
responding magnitude. Not least among these was the
tick pest in cattle, which entailed the drawing of lines of
demarcation between areas infested and those which were
clean. Prickly pear obtained control over millions of
acres of valuable country, and no method of eradicating
the plant by means financially practical has yet
been evolved, although large sums have been
spent by the Government in scientific experiment-
ing. Some conception of the troubles imposed by
animal pests may be derived from the following figures:
—The number of marsupials and dingoes destroyed since
the inception of the Act in 1877 to the end of 1919 in
respect of which bonus was paid has been 26,896,508,
comprising 7,935,175 kangaroos and wallaroos,
17,195,871 wallabies, 1,205,681 bandicoots, padda-
melons, and kangaroo rats, and 559,781 dingoes. The

Owing to their superior mobility, cattle have been
somewhat less prone to destruction by drought than
have sheep. The heavy losses among the latter could
have been avoided to a considerable extent had means
of transporting flocks to relief country existed. But
cattle are better able to travel faster over barren stock
routes. The construction of increased railway facilities,
of course, will minimize the mortality caused by future
periods of rainlessness, in regard to both classes of live
stock. Without such facilities, less risk from climatic
changes would be incurred in breeding horses than in
either cattle or sheep-raising. Unfortunately, other
causes have detracted from the attractiveness of horse-
breeding as a source for the investment of capital.
From the earliest days of pastoral settlement the
suitability of the climate and soil of Australia for
horse-breeding has been made abundantly apparent.
No part of the Commonwealth is better adapted to this
form of pastoral enterprise than is Queensland. For
many years a trade in the export of horses to India has
been based on the military requirements of the latter
country. The Australian horses have been eagerly
sought after there. From time to time high-class sires
and valuable mares have been imported into this
country, and so great has been the skill devoted to
breeding from this stock that the New Zealand-bred
“Carbine,” after being purchased for 13,000 guineas to
do duty at the stud in the United Kingdom, topped the
list of entires in Great Britain for one year with the
amount of money won by his stock. What has been
true of the racehorse applies to all classes of horses,
the types in Australia comparing favourably with those
from any part of the world. This is largely due to the
attention paid to the Turf and the car© taken by the
centres of racing control to cater particularly for horses
with bone, substance, and endurance, a stipulation
applying to the holding of registered meetings being
that a given number of races shall be of not less than
a certain minimum distance, whilst the richest prizes in
the Commonwealth are given for flat races ranging in
distance from a mile and a half to three miles, with
heavily-staked steeplechases, such as the Caulfield Grand
National, running to four miles. The tendency has
been all in the direction to encourage the better class of
thoroughbred at the expense of the short-distance
sprinter able to carry only feather-weights. The blood
of the best racehorses is the most eagerly sought after,
and this filters through to mould the tyjm of the national
standard of the light horses of the country. The Aus-
tralian racecourse has certainly proved a useful factor
in developing the standard of horses to a high plane.
In addition to the high prices paid for stallions by
breeders supplying the needs of racing men, pastoralists
commonly pay several hundreds of pounds for stallions
for station use. This has given to the Australian
remounts shipped to India the activity and endurance
for which they have been rightly noted. The reason of
this has not been a desire to meet the requirements of
the export trade, which is not large enough to influence
the policy of station-holders, whose main business is
wool-growing or cattle-raising. During the year 1919
only 331 horses, worth £5,595, were exported to
oversea ports from Queensland. Pastoralists have
bred good horses, because good horses were neces-
sary to get the station work done, especially where
runs were large and lengthy distances had to be
covered by boundary-riders, musterers, and others
between sunrise and night. The following table will
show how the number of horses in Queensland and
in the Commonwealth have increased during recent
years:
From these figures the reader can easily conceive
how trifling is our export trade in horses, seeing the
excellence of the stock produced, the steady demand
existing in India, and the short distance separating the
two portions of the Empire. Authorities well able to
express a reliable opinion have declared surprise that
the Commonwealth is not maintaining a trade with the
United Kingdom in general-purpose horses, and nearly
two decades ago, when General Hutton was Com-
mandant of the Australian military forces, he publicly
stated these views, pointing out that the step needed to


bring about a substantial development in the industry of
producing horses for overseas markets was the establish-
ment of purchasing depots where breeders and repre-
sentatives of the buyers might be brought into direct
touch with one another.
The reasons which Australian pastoralists usually
give for not breeding more horses than will suffice for
their own needs is that greater returns may be obtained
from the land by producing sheep or cattle. The fact
is that for very many years only unremunerative prices
prevailed for light horses throughout all the States.
This was not due to lack of oversea demand. The
military authorities in India were paying £45 per head
for all horses of the required standard brought to them.
The exporter from Australia might land a percentage in
India which would be rejected by the buyer; but the
dealer who knew his business would have very few of
pastoralist that no one has become sufficiently active in
the matter to secure satisfactory prices.
Should the Imperial Government establish purchas-
ing depots in this country it would save money if, pur-
chasing at a standard price of £3O per head, whilst
breeders would be well satisfied in being able to count on
receiving that sum for all the stock complying with the
stipulations as to conformation, soundness, and other
characteristics. The Commonwealth Government has
founded its own breeding establishments in order to
satisfy home military requirements. Good work would
have been done if also it had taken steps to co-operate
with the Imperial authorities with a view to securing
machinery for the direct purchase of horses from the
breeders. The latter step would have given so strong
an impetus to breeding that the Australian position
would have become much stronger than it is likely to be
HORSES AT HERMITAGE STATE FARM.
these. And, on the other hand, some of the horses he
landed would be sold, not as ordinary remounts, but as
officers’ chargers, and they would command a price
considerably higher than the regular £45. The cost
of shipment from Australia usually worked out at some-
thing under £10; but the breeder in Autralia did not
receive anything like £35 for a young remount. In the
nineties, and for some years afterwards, he might receive
only from £lO to £l5 per head, whilst the price pre-
vailing right down to the present is not in proportion
to what is paid in India, nor is it sufficient to induce
breeders to aim at the export trade. The trade has
always lacked organization in the interests of pro-
ducers. If similar conditions existed in the wool trade
the whole squatting fraternity would be up in arms
within a week. But the horse-export business has been
so much of a side issue to the general affairs of the
made by the Government entering the business, though
the latter step may also be necessary. The whole
success or otherwise of the horse-export trade depends
on the price paid here. The oversea demand exists on
a basis which renders possible the payment of remunera-
tive rates in Australia. But by lack of organization
landholders have never secured these rates, and the
horses exported have merely been the surplus stock not
needed for home requirements. Hardly any pastoralist
has aimed his operations directly to suit the oversea
requirements. Possibly a result of the Great War will be
that the Imperial Government will take steps towards
stimulating the production of military horses within the
Empire. This would probably include the direct pur-
chase from breeders, which would carry with it the
payment of a price sufficiently remunerative to give
profit to the horse-breeding industry.


THE UNITED GRAZIERS’ ASSOCIATION OF QUEENSLAND.
In giving a short history of the above Association,
it may be advisable to state some of the reasons which
led to its formation.
Previous to the year 1888, the Queensland
Shearers’ Union had been formed and was, on the
whole, acting fairly by the pastoralist employers, only
occasional instances of friction occurring. These condi-
tions continued until the year 1888, when the Queens-
land Shearers’ Union appointed a number of delegates
for the purpose of enforcing the enrolment of members
and seeing that the rules of the Union were carried
out, with a result that at times their action was so
intensely irritating that it led to frequent friction.
In June, 1889, at the request of the employers, a
sub-committee of pastoralists and a sub-committee of
the Shearers’ Union met at Blackall and drew up a
shearing agreement which was deemed satisfactory to
the representatives of both parties. But at the annual
meeting of the Queensland Shearers’ Union, held at the
same place in January, 1890, the shearers refused to
ratify the action of their own delegates, and proceeded
to draw up an agreement of an entirely different char-
acter without consulting the pastoralist employers. To
this latter agreement, the employers raised several objec-
tions, and suggested, as a way out of the difficulty,
that the Shearers’ Union should adopt the agreement
of the Amalgamated Shearers’ Union of Australasia—
a Union whose operations extended throughout the
States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Aus-
tralia. This request was refused by the Queensland
Shearers’ Union. In June, 1890, subsequent to what
is known as the “Jondaryan Dispute,’’ and in accord-
ance with the desire expressed at the conference which
settled that dispute, representatives of the Darling Downs
Pastoralists’ Association and delegates of the Darling
Downs branch of the Shearers’ Union met in conference
at Pittsworth. At that meeting a shearing agreement
was decided upon by both parties, but this on being
submitted to a general meeting of the Queensland
Shearers’ Union for ratification met with the usual re-
pudiation. This action on the part of the Union caused
considerable feeling and protest among the Darling
Downs shearers, which was only allayed by the Blackall
committee consenting that the agreement should remain
in force for one year in the Darling Downs district
alone. With the exception of the Darling Downs dis-
trict, shearing was being conducted throughout the rest
of the State under what was termed a verbal agreement,
which practically meant under Shearers’ Union rules.
In August, 1889, occurred what was known as the
maritime “call out,” which affected the whole of Aus-
tralia. This “call-out” was an order issued by the
executive of the Labour Unions, who were conducting
the maritime strike, that the whole of the members of
the Labour Federation of Australia should “down tools’’
and cease work in token of their support and sympathy
with the maritime employees. As a consequence of this
order, the majority of the pastoralist employers found
the whole of their work suddenly stopped, those who had
refused to accede to Union demands and who were
employing non-union labour being the only ones able to
carry on. It was also found that, through not having
signed agreements witli their men, they were practically
without redress.
This action on the part of the Labour leaders at
once demonstrated to the employers that if they were
to retain control of their business, they would be com-
pelled to have some written agreement between them-
selves and their men. As the previous efforts to frame
a mutual agreement had been unsuccessful, they decided
to draw up an agreement themselves, and accordingly at
a conference of representatives of all the Pastoralist
Associations of Australia, held in Melbourne on Novem-
ber 7, and in Sydney on December 22, 1890, a shearing
and shed hands agreement was decided upon. At the
same time, it was also decided to form employers’
organizations in the various States, and from these
organizations to establish a Federal Council for the
whole of Australia. One of the rules of this Federation
stipulated that if in any State there were more than one
pastoralist employers’ organization, they would have to
become amalgamated in order to secure representation
on the Federal body.
Previous to this meeting in December, 1890, four
pastoralist employers’ organizations had been estab-
lished in Queensland, viz., the Darling Downs Pastoral
Association, the Maranoa Pastoral Association, the
Warrego Pastoral Association, and the Queensland Pas-
toralists' Association at Barcaldine, which covered the
Central and Northern districts of the State. In order
that these four organizations might be able to speak
with a united voice on matters of importance to the
grazing interests of Queensland, as well as to secure
representation on the Federal Council of Australia, it
was decided to form a central organization, consisting of
representatives from each of the district Associations.
For this purpose a conference of representatives from
the district organizations was held at the offices of the
Queensland Employers’ Federation, Brisbane, about
September, 1890, the result of this conference being the
formation of what was then known as the “United
Pastoralists’ Association of Queensland.’’
At this conference, Mr. F. R. Murphy, M.L.A.,
acted as chairman and Mr. F. M. Ranson as secretary.
The conference decided to form an Association and drew

THE COUNCIL OF THE UNITED GRAZIERS’ ASSOCIATION OF QUEENSLAND, 1922.


up the rules for governing same, and the first council
meeting of the newly-formed Association was held in
January, 1891, when the late Hon. Wm. Allan, M.L.C.,
was elected President. Since that date there have only
been three other Presidents —the late John Cameron,
M.L.A., 1895 to 1908 ; the late W. W. Hood, 1909 to
1913; and the Hon. A. H. Whittingham, M.L.C., the
present President, who has occupied the position since
1913. Under his presidency the Association has largely
increased its membership, and to-day occupies the posi-
tion of second largest of the graziers’ associations of
Australia in number of members and of stock.
Mr. F. M. Ranson occupied the position of Secre-
tary from the inception of the Association until his
retirement in October last.
The first offices of the Association were in the
“Courier” Building, where they remained for a period
of about twenty-six years until their present offices in
Union Bank Chambers were secured. One of the most
important disputes which the Association has been
engaged in was that of the shearers’ strike of 1891.
It began about January 4, at Peak Downs Station, in
the Clermont district, owing to the refusal of the men
to sign the agreements which had been framed by the
Federal Pastoralist Organizations of Australia, and prac-
tically lasted till the end of June of that year. During
its course serious trouble occurred, in fact, at one period
it almost developed into an insurrection, and the Gov-
ernment of the day were forced to call out the military
in order to assist the police in effectively maintaining
law and order.
.The Association took a leading part in this dispute,
and through its instrumentality large bodies of men
were engaged in the Southern States, Tasmania, and
New Zealand to carry on the work of shearing. Latterly
the dispute centred around the question of the holding
of conferences between the parties. To this the em-
ployers were agreeable, provided the men accepted the
principle of ‘‘freedom of contract,” defined by the
Federal Pastoralist Organizations of Australia, as:
Employers shall be free to employ and shearers
shall be free to accept employment whether belong-
ing to shearers’ or other unions or not, without
favour, molestation, or intimidation on either
side.”
But this did not satisfy the leaders of the Union, and
in consequence the strike dragged out a weary length
until the funds of the Union were practically exhausted.
In 1907, the Association was a party to the first
application of the Australian Workers’ Union (which
had absorbed all the Pastoral Employees’ Organizations
in Australia) for a shearing award for the whole of
Australia under the provisions of the Commonwealth
Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The case was heard
ill Sydney before Mr. Justice O’Connor, the first Arbi-
tration Court Judge, and under that award shearing
rates were increased from 20s. to 245., witlr propor-
tionate increase for shed hands. Since then other
Federal Court awards have been given by Mr. Justice
Higgins in 1911 and in 1917, generally with increasing
rates for the employees.
The Queensland branch of the A.W.U. in 1918
decided to apply for and obtained an award under the
State Court, and Queensland has since that date been
under awards of this Court.
In addition to the work of dealing with industrial
matters, the Association has also taken a jirominent
part in legislation and other questions affecting the
occupation of the land by its members. One of tire
first Acts which it had to deal with was the Rabbit Act
of 1892, and the Meat and Dairy Produce Act of 1893,
both of which were of great importance to the develop-
ment of the grazing industry of Queensland.
After the big drought of 1899-1902, the Association
took an active part in the framing of an amending Land
Act, which had for its object the rehabilitation of the
grazing industry of Queensland from the disastrous
effects of that calamity. It was through the Associa-
tion s representations that the public of Queensland were
aroused to the importance of the grazing industry, in
relation to the commercial and financial life of the State,
and to the necessity for some action being taken in order
to enable those engaged in it to restore the industry to
its former position. This agitation was mainly con-
ducted under the presidency of the late John Cameron
M.L.A.
It is interesting to note that since its formation
in 1891 the character of the Association has gradually
undergone a change, inasmuch as a large number of
grazing farmers, both sheep and cattle, have joined its
ranks. It was in recognition of this fact that the name
of the Association was changed to the "United Pas-
torahste’ and Grazing Farmers’ Association of Queens-
land, and later to its present title, the ‘‘United
Graziers Association of Queensland.” To-day the
Association’s membership is largely composed of the
grazing farmers of the State; in fact, they constitute
80 per cent, of its membership. This illustrates the
gradual change which has taken place in the character
of the grazing industry in Queensland during the last
... o
thirty years.
To set out in detail all the ramifications of the
Association would take more space that can be allotted
to the subject in such a publication as this, but the
foregoing particulars regarding the activities of the
Association show how valuable its operations have been
to the graziers of the State, who should continue to
give it their hearty and loyal support.


Central Queensland.
Central Queensland does not appear on the map as
the result of any special fixed design in survey.
Instead of being all the territory between the 25th and
22nd parallels west to the South Australian boundary,
it starts from nowhere in particular, a little north of
Bundaberg and the Burnett Heads, and the coastline
terminates at Cape Palmerston, a little south of Mackay.
on the 25th parallel near Taroom, but does not extend to
that township. It includes Tambo, but leaves Windorah
in Southern Queensland and takes in Jundah and
Blackall. On the east coast the line passes Rosedale
railway station between Bundaberg and Gladstone. On
the north the boundary line includes Fort Cooper, Lake
Buchanan, Corfield, Kynuna, and Urandangi.
EAST STREET, ROCKHAMPTON. SHOWING POST OFFICE.
From that Caps it runs on a general westerly—but very
irregular—line to South Australia, near where the 21st
parallel crosses the Georgina River, not far from Lake
Nash. The southern boundary starts near the Burnett
Heads, and runs westerly in a most erratic course until
it, too, ends at the South Australian boundary near
where the Mulligan River joins Eyre Creek.
For some unaccountable reason a long narrow strip
runs up the east side of the Dawson River from Camboon
Central Queensland extends over 135,823,360 acres,
or 212,224 square miles.
The only mining in western Central Queensland is in
the north-west corner at Selwyn and Mount Elliott. But
there is a vast extent of mineral country east of the Divid-
ing Range. Within that area lies the famous Mount
Morgan, the richest gold mine in the world; the copper
and gold mines of the Peak Downs; the sapphire and
emerald fields bf Anakie; the great coal seams of the


Dawson and Mackenzie Valleys; and the numerous
mineral fields in the Gladstone and Rockhampton dis-
tricts. Manganese, wolfram, molybdenite, and bismuth
are also among the minerals of the Central District.
The western Central District so far is essentially
an area devoted to sheep and cattle. The great wool-
scouring works are at Blackall, Barcaldine ; Ilfracombe,
Longreach, and Winton. The West includes some of
the richest grazing country in Australia and some of
the largest stations and most numerous flocks of sheep
and cattle. Central Queensland to-day represents half
the total of the sheep in the whole State.
West of the Drummond Range the whole country is
a vast plateau from 800 to 1,100 ft. above sea level,
mostly rolling downs, with a rare, clear atmosphere, the
temperature of the summer months varying from 66° to
96°, with a, February mean of 78° to 84°, and the
winter months with a maximum of 70° to 74°, a mini-
mum of 40° to 51°, and a mean of 55° to 60°.
The Census shows a birthrate of 28’50, while
that of all Queensland was 29 50. This shows favour-
ably in a comparison with the birthrate of the other
States and Tasmania and New Zealand, Tasmania being
30, New Zealand 26'50, South Australia 28'65, New
South Wales and Victoria about 30.
The death rate of Central Queensland at last
Census was only 11, while Victoria was 12, Western
Australia 11, Tasmania 1070, and South Australia
10 28. It is considerably lower than England, Wales,
Ireland, Scotland, and all the countries of Europe,
so that Western Queensland can lay claim to be one of
the healthiest countries in the world.
ROCKHAMPTON.
Very eventful and interesting is the history of Rock-
hampton, the capital town of Central Queensland, with
a present-day population of nearly 25,000, on the right
bank of the Fitzroy River, 25 miles from where it enters
Keppel Bay. The approach to Rockhampton by sea is
very attractive and interesting, the vessel passing
along near the coast of Curtis Island, a long island
extending from opposite Gladstone to Keppel Bay.
The northern end terminates in Caps Capricorn, so
named because it is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn,
and the steamer rounds that Cape and enters Keppel
Bay, keeping the northern end of Curtis Island on the
left, passing Lea Hill, a point on the island, and so on
into the mouth of the Fitzroy River.
The main city of to-day stands on dead-level
land sloping back from the river to swamps or low-
lying country which originally was part of the old
"Gracemere” run, taken up by the Archer brothers in
1855. Those pioneer squatters held the present
“Durundar” Station, near Caboolture, in 1843, when
Leichhardt was their guest for a week, the year before
he started for Port Essington. On that great exploring
trip, Leichhardt discovered and named the Dawson and
Mackenzie Rivers, and expressed a belief that both
would run into one large river going to the eastern coast.
His far-seeing prediction was correct. These two rivers
run into the Fitzroy, on which now stands the city of
Rockh ampton.
In the year 1853 Charles and William Archer, two
of the Archer brothers, of "Durundar, ” started
north on an exploring trip in search of new pastoral
country, suggested by what they heard from Leichhardt
after his return from Port Essington in 1846. The
Archers at last reached the summit of the Dee Range at
or near the present Mount Morgan, and from there saw
a large river in the distance away to the north. Travel-
ling towards that river they came to what is now known
as the Gracemere Lagoon, about six miles out of
Rockhampton.
That beautiful lake was considered by them to be
an ideal spot for a camp or a site for a homestead on some
future occasion, and then they went on until they reached
the river of which they were the first discoverers
-—the Fitzroy. Having decided to apply for that
country as a station, the Archers returned to the
Burnett and to "Ramies,” then held by the Messrs.
Leith-Hay—the most northerly settlement at that time.
There was evidently some hitch about the return, as
they did not start back to the Fitzroy until June,
1855.
Charles Archer was the leader of the party, H. W.
Risien, second in command; C. Beeman, storekeeper;
fourteen Europeans, four Burnett River blacks,
and four native police with their aboriginal wives.
Murders of whites by the blacks were then painfully
common on the Burnett and Mary Rivers, and the
Archers were wisely not assuming that the Fitzroy blacks
were any more reliable, and so carefully took a strong
party in case of trouble. They took several thousand
sheep, horses, and bullock teams, and a complete equip-
ment. There were no tracks or roads in those days, and
travelling with such an outfit was a serious business,
the journey to Gracemere Lagoon taking six weeks.
It was a dry year and water was scarce elsewhere, so
there the Archers established their head station, and
their descendants are still in occupation.
In the middle of 1856 Colin Archer and E. Kelly
came over from the Burnett with the balance of the
stock and outfit. Then the Elliott brothers followed
the Archers from the Burnett, took up a station north
of the Fitzroy and called it "Canoona,” a name to be-
come memorable in two more years. The sole inhabi-
tants of the district at the Christmas of 1856 were the


Archers and Elliotts and their employes, a total of about
36. In the meantime W. H. Wiseman arrived
as Crown Lands Commissioner. It was then decided to
have a township surveyed, and the Archers and Wise-
man selected the site and the name of the town.
Wiseman came from the town of Hampton in Eng-
land, and he suggested “Rock-Hampton,” and Rock-
hampton it duly became, being proclaimed officially in
1857. The new town increased slowly, very slowly, until
August, 1858, when suddenly in a few weeks Rockhamp-
ton became a household word in Australia.
A Cornish miner named Chappie had been prospect-
ing for some time in the Gladstone district, and from
there he went to “Canoona” Station, then held by
Ramsay and Gaden, who had bought it from the Elliotts.
Sydney and Melbourne, with samples of the gold,
and wild tales were circulated. Thousands of men rushed
from the South to Canoona by all the vessels that could
be chartered, and Rockhampton being the shipping port
and terminus of navigation and the only source of trade
and supplies, hotels and stores arose as if by magic.
The collapse of Canoona was not fatal to Rockhampton.
It was certainly a severe check, but had the effect of
placing the town on a sounder basis.
There were some fine types of men among those
attracted by the rush to Canoona, and a number of these
settled at Rockhampton. Squatters came up from the
south -and took up runs at Broadsound and out on the
Dawson, the Mackenzie, the Nogoa, the Belyando, and
the Peak Downs. A tremendous stimulus was given to
GENERAL VIEW OF ROCKHAMPTON.
Chappie found gold on that run, and went back to Glad-
stone with about 20 oz., which he showed in Hardy’s
hotel and to Captain Maurice O’Connell, the Government
Resident at Gladstone. A prospecting party was
promptly organized, including H. Friend, Ellis and
Hardy (two publicans), Dan Martin (a butcher), Hitch-
cock, Till, and a Dr. Robertson. Chappie returned with
this party, who were followed by a dray with provi-
sions, driven by a man named Arthur. The discovery in
the meantime had been voiced over a wider area, and
when Chappie’s party arrived there were twelve
Germans working in the creek.
The new party got 8 oz. in an hour, but a fortnight
only returned 22 oz. In the meantime news reached
Rockhampton when gold and copper were discovered on
the Peak Downs, near the present Clermont, in 1861.
From 1863 to 1870 were the palmy years of the Peak
Downs Copper Company, and Rockhampton got all that
trade, and so with, the goldfields of the Crocodile,
Morinish, Ridgelands, and Rosewood in 1865-6-7. The
Mount Wheeler field was found in 1868, and a boy there,
son of a miner, stuck his father’s pick into a 247 oz.
nugget while his father was at dinner.
In October, 1858, Sir John Robertson, Premier of
Now South Wales, sent three surveyors to proceed with
the laying out of the town. These were A. F. Wood,
Isaac Rowland, and Clarendon Stuart. Wood had assisted
to lay out Melbourne, and he planned Rockhampton on


the same lines, with broad streets and narrow lanes
alternating from east to west. The first land sale was
held on November 17, 1858, some lots bringing high
prices, whilst a subsequent sale in September, 1861,
realized £3,040, Sir Charles Nicholson, afterwards first
President of the Legislative Council, being one of the
principal buyers.
At the Census of 1861 Rockhampton had a popu-
lation of 700. The town was proclaimed a municipality
on December 15, 1860, and the first council was elected
on February 26, 1861, with John Palmer as Mayor,
F. K. Milne as Town Clerk, and T. Burstall as Town
Surveyor. The first newspaper, The Bulletin , was
issued on Tuesday, July 9, 1861, from a plant brought
up from Sydney by W. H. Buzacott, who was joined by
his brother, Charles Hardie Buzacott, who in after years
became Postmaster-General. In January, 1863, Arthur
Leslie Boucicault, brother of Dion Boucicault, started
The Northern Argus as a bi-weekly and conducted it for
twenty years, changing from a bi-weekly to a daily.
The first Governor to visit Rockhampton was Sir
George Bowen, who called there on October 10, 1862, on
his return in H.M.S. “Pioneer” from a trip to Cape
York, where he advised starting the settlement now called
Somerset.
Beyond the river, on the eastern side, is the pic-
turesque Berserker Range, rising in various peaks to a
height of 1,600 ft., and the railway of 32 miles to Emu
Park, opened on December 22, 1888, passes round the
southern end of the range.
Rockhampton is specially favoured with watering
places, Emu Park being most picturesque, and com-
manding glorious views of marine scenery. About six
miles north is Yeppoon, under the shadow of a romantic
hill, with a 20-mile beach of white sand. A railway
runs there as a branch from the Emu Park
line. Both places are favourite resorts for the people
of Rockhampton, Mount Morgan, and the west.
Three miles from Rockhampton, on the Emu Park
and Yeppoon line, at Lake’s Creek, named after Captain
T. A. Lake, a master mariner who traded to Rock-
hampton in the early sixties, are the meat-
preserving and freezing works of the Central Queensland
Meat Export Company, one of the largest and most
successful in Australia.
When the Great North Coast line is completed there
will be lines north to Cairns, south to Brisbane, west to
Springsure and Clermont, to Blackall, Aramac, and
Longreach. The Fitzroy at the city is spanned by two
bridges—one for general traffic, the other carrying the
railway line. The city gets its water supply chiefly from
the Murray Lagoon behind the Athelstone Range, the
water being pumped into reservoirs holding a million
gallons each. The quality is not first class, especially
when the lagoons are low in a dry season. The City
Council has decided upon a scheme to obtain an addi-
tional supply from the Fitzroy near Yaamba.
The city is lighted by gas and electricity, with tram-
ways on the French steam-motor system, installed at a
cost of ,£42,000.
Education Las received careful attention, there
being fifteen State Schools, a number of denominational
Schools, several private High Schools, two Grammar
Schools, and a Technical College.
There are clubs for bowling, sailing, rowing, foot-
ball, tennis, croquet, cricket, swimming, and horse racing.
There are flutter factories, wool scours, a large
brewery, an iceworks, foundries, railway workshops, and
a number of small factories.
The Botanic Gardens are on the western side of the
Athelstone Range, sloping to the Murray Lagoon, and
besides occupying an ideal position are particularly well
laid out, and contain the most beautiful tropical foliage.
* Quay Street fronts the river, the wharves, and the
shipping, and is ornamented by a line of handsome trees
planted by a council in the early years. The average
rainfall in the city is about 45 in.
Rockhampton is so far the seaport for all the
towns and pastoral country west to South Aus-
tralia, and when the railway connects with Winton
a considerable trade that now goes to Townsville
will certainly be diverted to Rockhampton.

Famed the world over for its mine—the show mine
of Queensland —Mount Morgan lies 24 miles south-west
from Rockhampton.
Gold was first discovered here in 1882 by the Mor-
gan brothers, and samples of stone sent to Gympie gave
a return of nearly 3,700 oz. of gold to the ton. Later,
a limited liability company was formed with a capital
of £1,000,000 and registered in 1886. From that date
the mineral wealth produced amounts to £27,674,000,
and as many as 2,590 men have been employed at one
time. The romantic story of the discovery and the his-
tory of the mine has already been told at length on pages
six and seven of this volume, and provides reading which
fires the imagination.
Practically the whole of the population of the town,
about 7,600 persons, are maintained through the rich-
ness of the mine which, in 1921, produced 17,494 fine
oz. of gold; 7,758 oz. of silver; 1,289 tons of copper;
and 1,691 tons of fireclay.
I he town has a Technical College, School of Mines
High School, State Schools, various churches and the
usual places of business.

EMERALD.
The first section of this railway, 30 miles to the
westward, was opened on September 17, 1867, and the
final section to Longreach on February 15, 1892. The
line travels over granite country followed by a
narrow belt of desert sandstone and a crescent-shaped
strip of coal measures, to Gogango, passing into the
Devonian Burdekin beds, and thence some miles, before
arriving at Duaringa, into fresh water carboniferous
country, continuing to beyond the Comet, where the line
enters a broad basaltic belt on the Nogoa River. It
passes out of this belt at Withersfield into carboniferous
country, continuing on to the Belyando, where the line
enters into desert sandstone, whence it emerges on the
Alice into the cretaceous rolling downs of the West.
At the junction where the lines branch off from the
main line, north 62 miles to Clermont, south 40 miles
to Springsure, and 165 miles west from Rockhampton,
stands the neat little township of Emerald, on high,
dry level country near the bank of the Nogoa River.
The last section of the main line from Rockhampton,
a length of 25 miles from the Comet River to Emerald,
was opened on May 26, 1879, and a section of 38| miles
west from Emerald to Withersfield was opened on
October 20, 1880.
Emerald stands on old “Emerald Downs” Station,
and in the district are “Kerry Downs,” “Glendarri-
well,” “Lochlees,” “Nogoa Downs,” and “Withers-
field.” The Nogoa River at that point is a narrow
stream about 30 yards in width, with high steep banks
and deep pools at intervals all along the channel.
Emerald is a busy and important railway centre.
It has a fine railway refreshment-room and provides for
all the passengers going to and fro between Rockhamp-
ton and the West and those travelling on the branch
lines to Clermont and Springsure.
The railway from Emerald to Springsure cost only
£2,681 per mile, and the line to Clermont £2,753.
There are four churches, a hospital, a Shire Council,
two jockey clubs, and rifle, tennis, and cricket clubs;
societies of Masons, Hibernians, and Oddfellows, a
School of Arts, banks, hotels, and all the usual business
premises of a thriving town.
CAPELLA.
Thirty-two miles from Emerald and half-way to
Clermont is the township of Capella, named from the
Capella of Switzerland, standing on beautiful open
downs country of rich basaltic soil suitable for grazing,
dairying, farming, or orchards. It is the depot for a
number of large sheep and cattle stations. From here
you can see the romantic cone-shaped mountains from
which Leichhardt in 1845 gave a name to the Peak
Downs.
Those majestic and picturesque peaks are clearly
visible on the sky line —“Fletcher Awl,” Gilbert
Dome,” “Roper Peak” “Wolfang Peak,” and Table
Mountain.” It is beautiful and fertile country, with a
perfect climate.
CLERMONT.
Named from one of the French Clermonts, Clermont
started in the same manner as many other Queensland
towns. The lagoon (on old “Retro” Station) was an
attractive locality for teamsters to camp, and they were
followed by one or two shanties, a blacksmith’s shop, a
store, and a public house.
Then gold was discovered in 1860, and there was
a small rush to Nelson Gully —enough to start a town-
ship. Then came Garibaldi Gully, Friendly Gully, and
McDonald Gully, and diggers were coming from all
directions, so that gold was the supreme mineral until
the first smelting of copper in 1864.
The years 1862 and 1863 were years of drought,
and a number of people were lost and died of thirst.
Provisions were scarce and dear, all except beef, which
was obtained in abundance from a station started by
Oscar de Satge eight miles north, and “Hood Lad
Drummond” Station 12 miles south. At the end of
1863 a man named Hurley discovered a rich deposit
which lasted for some time and gave good results,
including a 30-oz. nugget.
Fever, low fever, and ague were seriously pre-
valent in the wet season of 1864, and provisions rose to
famine prices.
The first official in charge of the field was Acting
Commissioner J. C. Wheeler, who continued until
superseded by T. J. Griffin in November, 1863. This
Griffin was the Acting Gold Commissioner who on
November 6, 1867, murdered his two troopers, Power
and Cahill, at the crossing of the Mackenzie in order
to obtain the £8,151 in cash being taken by the escort
to Clermont. And when Charles Hardie Buzacott started
the first Clermont newspaper, The Peak Downs Telegram,
on October 14, 1864, Griffin headed the list with £5
at a meeting held to subscribe £IOO to pay the cost of
carriage of the printing plant.
In 1870 there came a flood that nearly annihilated
Clermont, and Mr. Buzacott and one of his printers
spent the whole night in a tree, whilst his type and print-
ing materials were all washed away. There were fifteen
persons drowned. That flood should have been sufficient
to warn the people that the site was unsuitable for a
town, and that it would be wise to occupy the higher
ridge on the opposite side of the lagoon. It must have
been apparent to some of the more observant bushmen
that one day both branches of Sandy Creek would be
flooded, and Clermont be destroyed. That is practically


what happened in 1917, when the biggest known flood
came down without any warning and nearly washed
away the whole town.
Clermont was at the time an important town with
about 1,500 people, and 5,000 in the surrounding dis-
tiict. The number of lives lost—sixty-seven—was
greater than in any flood recorded in Australia except
that of Gundagai, in New South Wales, in 1851, when
seventy-two people were drowned.
Hie folly of persisting in rebuilding a township on
such an unsuitable sit© had become too painfully
apparent to everybody, and those remaining decided to
remove on to the adjoining high ground, where the
town should have been from the beginning, and the
of £33,000, had paid the shareholders £300,000. Shares
fell from £8 to 5e., and the mine was sold for the small
sum of £3,000. The first copper was sent to Rock-
hampton, a distance of about 300 miles, but a much
shorter road was found from Copperfield to Broadsound,
and the copper was sent to that port until a squatter
named Featherstonhaugh shortened the Rockhampton
route by 50 miles with the discovery of a new and better
track.
Apart from the mining industry Clermont is the
depot for a vast area of rich pastoral country extending
east, west, and north ; and all the Peak Downs district
consists of excellent soil for agriculture, being chiefly
red or black basalt.
VIEW OF QUAY, ROCKHAMPTON.
new Clermont of to-day is one of the neatest, best
situated, and securely flood-proof towns in Queensland.
The average rainfall is about 27 in. The railway to
Clermont was opened on March 26, 1884, and the train
now runs 11 miles beyond Clermont to Blair Athol.
The Blair Athol mine is claimed to' have a seam of pure
coal 65 feet in thickness, and there are estimated to be
443,000,000 tons of coal in sight.
There was no doubt that the Peak Downs Copper
Mine was discovered in 1861 by a one-eyed shepherd
named Jack Mollard, an old Cornish miner, whose sole
reward was a £5 note and a bottle of brandy. The
heavy fall in copper in 1873 and 1874 ruined the Peak
Downs Mine, which, however, with a subscribed capital
SPRINGSURE.
This line branches from the main railway 166 miles
west of Rockhampton, within two miles of the Nogoa
River. It was opened to Springsure on August 16,
1887. The line runs for the whole distance across
basalt country, along the divide of the Comet and Nogoa
waters, both tributaries of the Mackenzie.
Springsure occupies a beautiful position, standing
on a series of undulations in a little valley, through the
centre of which ripples the clear water of Springsure
Creek. The last Census gave the population of the town
at 500 and the district 1,450. It is a quiet little town
at present, but thirty-five years ago Springsure was the
centre of considerable activity, being the depot for


much of the Barcoo trade, besides that of the surround-
ing district. There were four hotels at that time
and a branch of the A.J.S. Bank; now there are two
hotels and the Bank has vanished. It owns three stores,
a post and money-order office, a reading-room, and the
Bauhinia Divisional Board has its office there.
The smiling little valley is enclosed in an
amphitheatre of hills, open only at the giant gateway
through which the railway enters from the north. The
western portal of that gateway is a solid, vertical, cliff-
faced, caverned mountain, rising straight up and frown-
ing over the entrance from a height of about 1,500 ft.
Among those fantastic hills at the back of Springsure,
a girdling zone of the earthquake’s rarest workmanship,
are mines of choicest opals. Springsure opal sold to
Streeter, of London, was made into an opal suit© for
Lady Brassey, who on her visit to Rockhampton went
out to Springsure by special train and saw and conversed
with Mr. Frank Batho, who sold to Streeter the
original opal of those jewels for which she paid 200
guineas.
ROLLESTON.
Away out on the Comet River, about 50 miles
south-east in a direct line from Springsure, and not far
from the junction of Meteor Creek and the Comet,
stands the small township of Rolleston, in the midst of
rich pastoral country, which includes “Bauhinia
Downs,” “Consuelo,” “Planet Downs,” “Rewan,” and
“Warinilla” Stations. There, too, is a vast expanse
of rich agricultural country to be made one day avail-
able by railway —country extending east to the Dawson
and west to the Nogoa.
Rolleston was named from Rolleston, near Newark,
in Lincolnshire.
There is a good hotel, and this progressive little
township has its jockey, cricket, and tennis clubs. A
motor service to Spiingsure carries the mails and pas-
sengers each way.
The average rainfall is about 27 in.
ANAKIE.
Leaving Emerald for the west the line passes through
fine open park-like country, with brigalow scrubs and
dwarf bloodwood, to Anakie, where the engine waters
at a> big lagoon in the midst of ash and brigalow.
Anakie is famous as the gem centre of Australia, where
blue, yellow, and white sapphires of the highest quality
are found in considerable numbers, allied with rubies,
zircons, garnets, and several other gems. These Anakie
sapphires have a world-wide reputation, and many
foreign buyers visit the field. In 1921 the gems found
in the Anakie district were valued at £46,524.
JERICHO.
After crossing the main range, which divides all the
eastern and western rivers, one is on the watershed of
the Barcoo, the Coopers Creek of Sturt, the river once
associated with so much mystery, and still recalling so
many sad memories of the old explorers. From the
range to Jericho the line passes through open forest of
silver ironbark, box, and pines and scrubs of gidya,
brigalow, box, and turkey bush.
Jericho stands on a box-gum flat. It once
received the trade from Blackall, about 71 miles away,
and Cobb’s coach ran from that township twice weekly;
but the opening of the railway to Blackall, on March
31, 1908, made Jericho a wayside station, but still the
depot for a large area of pastoral country.
BLACKALL.
Sixty-seven miles south from Barcaldine by road,
71 miles south-west from Jericho by branch railway,
and 378 miles west by rail from Rockhampton, on old
“ Alice Downs” Station stands the township of Blackall,
named in remembrance of Colonel Samuel Wensley
Blackall, Governor of Queensland from August 14, 1868,
to January 2, 1871. lie died in Brisbane and is buried
in the Toowong Cemetery.
The railway to Blackall was opened on March 31,
1908. It is a municipal town situated on the Barcoo
River 929 ft. above the sea. The railway is being
extended towards Windorah on Coopers Creek, some
distance below the junction of the Barcoo and the
Thomson, whose united waters become Coopers Creek.
In March, 1920, the line was opened to Yaraka, a
distance of 98 miles beyond Blackall, and 702 ft. above
sea level, a fall of 227 ft. from that town, the surface
falling continuously towards Central Australia.
Before the railway went beyond Blackall coaches
ran regularly from there to Isisford, Listowel Downs,
Mount Arthur, and Tambo. The coaches still run to
and from Tambo, but the extension of the line has not
improved the trade of Blackall, though there are many
stations which will always regard that town as their
natural depot.
The town is supplied with water laid on
from the artesian bore, which was one of the first of
the western bores, and it is suitable for irrigation.
Fruits, flowers, and farm produce grow there to
perfection, and dairying is also successful. The town
is neatly laid out, and the streets have rows of hand-
some flowering shade trees.
Blackall is a considerable town with a population
of about 1,500. The Press is represented by The Barcoo
Independent.


TAMBO.
South-east from Blackall, on old “Northampton
Downs” Station, a distance of 77 miles, is the important
township of Tambo, the aboriginal name of a native yam.
It stands on the head of the eastern branch of the
Barcoo River, at a height of 1,300 ft. above sea level,
actually on the range dividing the eastern and western
waters. It is also near the border of Southern and
Central Queensland, o:i the head of the Ward River, a
tributary of the Warrego.
At time of writing the population of the Tambo
Shire Council is about 1,500. The town has a good water
supply laid on by reticulation from the bore which is
down 2,500 ft., and throws 750,000 gallons daily at a
temperature of about 118°, with a pressure of 15 lb. to
the square inch, a remarkable pressure for water from a
bore 1,300 ft. above sea level.
from the Barcaldine of Scotland. It lies 361 miles west
from Rockhampton, and the final 32 miles of railway
from Alice River was opened to Barcaldine on Novem-
ber 8, 1886.
Not until February 15, 1892, was the extension of the
railway opened to Longreach, the present terminus.
That extension naturally affected Barcaldine as far as
the western trade was concerned, but still left it as the
depot of an immense pastoral territory north and south.
It stands on level, sandy soil, 900 ft. above sea level,
and wide streets are planted with flowering trees which
diffuse a fragrant odour when in bloom. The water
supply comes from two artesian bores, which supply a
million gallons daily, water credited with valuable
therapeutic properties and patronized freely in very
excellent public baths. The latest available figures show
the Barcaldine Shire as having a population of about
VIEW OF LONGREACH, LOOKING TOWABOS RAILWAY STATION.
Tam bo is on a very active line of traffic by horse,
buggy, coach, and motor between Charleville, Auga-
thella, Tambo, and Blackall. In a direct line Charleville
is 100 miles due south, and Blackall 77 miles north-west.
A motor service runs between Tambo and Blackall,
and motors and coaches run through from Charleville
to Tambo and Blackall. Buggy services run from Tambo
to Minnie Downs and Ravensbourne, and to Augathella,
via Oakwood.
There are many grazing selectors in the district,
and also the well-known stations, “Birkhead”
and “Ravensbourne,” “Greendale,” “Lansdowne,”
“Tambo,” “Minnie Downs,” “Narade,” and “Baneda.”
BARCALDINE.
This is an important western town of Central
Queensland on old “Barcaldine Downs” Station, named
2,500. There is a State school with an average of 250
scholars, and a Convent school averaging 150 pupils.
The Press is represented by The Western Champion ,
a long-established and excellent paper.
There are two extensive wool scours a short distance
from the town, and sheep are shorn there for a number
of the smaller graziers. Some of the largest sheep
stations in the State are in the outlying district.
ARAMAC.
Due north from Barcaldine, a distance of 42 miles,
is the township of Aramac, standing on a creek which
is one of the heads of the Thomson. It is connected
with Barcaldine by a steam tramway which is just an
ordinary 3 ft. 6 in. gauge railway, but is controlled by
the Aramac Shire Council, though the train movements
appear on the official railway time table. That tramway


crosses, the three large stations of “Westbourne,”
“Coreena,” and “Saltern.”
The town is on the “Stainburn Downs” Station, in
the midst of a vast expanse of open downs country, with
the usual dry clear atmosphere of the West and an
average rainfall of 18 in.
In a direct line Aramac is 50 miles from Mutta-
burra, 75 from Longreach, and 150 from Winton.
North-east, 50 miles from the town, is Lake Galilee, a
remarkable lake close to the Dividing Range separating
the western and eastern rivers. Fifty miles north of
Galilee is Lake Buchanan, a large lake-filled with water
salt as the sea.
Most of the trade of Aramac is done with Barcal-
dine. It is the trade centre for a great number
of important sheep and cattle stations, including
“Acacia Downs,” “Barcoorah,” “Bowen Downs,”
“Paradise Downs,” “Adelong,” “Stainburn Downs,”
“Finnigan,” “Dunrobin,” “Stagmount,” “Tua-
burra,” and many smaller areas.
There is a Court of Petty Sessions and Police Court
visited by the Longreach Police Magistrate, a School of
Arts, hospital, two racing clubs, tennis and jockey clubs,
State School (averaging 100 pupils), two churches and
four hotels. Coaches run to Corinda, Reedy Creek, and
Muttaburra. The train luns tri-weekly to and from
Barcaldine.
LONGREACH.
This very important and prosperous Western town
is situated on the Thomson River, which junctions with
the Barcoo on “Galway Downs” Station, not far from
Windorah. There is a long, deep reach in the river
near the township, and that suggested the name of
Longreach to the surveyor.
Longreach is a comparatively new town, as the last
section of the railway, 16| miles from Ilfracombe, was
only opened on February 15, 1892.
Between Barcaldine and Longreach the railway
passes the small settlements of Westbourne, Saltern,
Brixton, Dartmouth, Ilfracombe, and Cleeve, the
largest being Ilfracombe, with a population of about 300,
the depot for a number of well-known stations, includ-
ing “Wellshot,” “Kelso,” “Beaconsfield,” “Rodney
Downs,” and “Newstead.” All these small places are
overshadowed by Longreach, which, with the district,
has a population of over 4,000. In 1846 Sir Thomas
Mitchell found the Barcoo, which he called the Vic-
toria, but just missed the Thomson River, which was
found and named in 1847 by Edward Kennedy in
honour of Edward Deas-Thomson, of Sydney.
Longreach stands on the eastern side of the Thomson,
the site being on “Bimbah” Station, with Glenbuck in
the south and Carnoola on the north. It is a very
important town occupying an advantageous geographical
position. It is distant 428 miles from Rockhampton,
and as the first section of that Western railway, 30 miles
to Westwood, was opened on September 17, 1867, there
was a period of about twenty-five years occupied in
extending the railway from Rockhampton to Longreach.
The town commands a trade extending west to the
border of South Australia, including that of the
Thomson, Diamantina, and lower Georgina Rivers. It
stands on the Tropic of Capricorn and is 400 miles in a
direct line to the border of South Australia. Birds-
ville, our most western town in the south, is 375,
Bedourie 320, Boulia 300, and Windorah 175 miles.
When the Transcontinental line is made from the
New South Wales border north to Camooweal some of
the present Longreach trade is certain to be diverted
to Charleville, but in any case Longreach must remain a
permanent and prosperous town.
In the centre of some of the richest pastoral
country in the world, the town standing on dead-level,
dry, healthy land, is laid out with fine wide streets
which are planted with ornamental flowering trees and
shrubs. Water is laid on from the bore, whose waters
are equally suitable for drinking, cooking, or irrigation.
It emerges from the bore at a temperature of 162°, and
when sufficiently cooled for the baths is credited with
possessing decided curative powers in sciatica, rheuma-
tism, and various other ailments. The town is governed
by.- a Shire Council of nine members. The police are
represented by a sub-inspector, a sergeant, nine con-
stables, and a tracker. Religious sects include the Church
of England, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Roman
Catholic, all with highly creditable churches. The
Longreach Club has always maintained a high standard
and there are also rifle, tennis, cricket and football
clubs, and Masonic and Oddfellows and Hibernian
lodges. There is a very strong and successful
Pastoral and Agricultural Society, a Fire Brigade Board,
four banks, State Savings Bank, a Convent and Girls’
High School, a State School with an average of 250
scholars, extensive stores, wine and spirit merchants,
fruiterers, confectioners, restaurants and thirteen hotels.
The Press is represented by The Longreach News, a
paper issued on Saturdays.
The motor car heralded the doom of Cobb’s coach,
the good old vehicle which did splendid work in the
pioneering days. Even the shearers and stockmen travel
on bicycles, or motor cycles and motor lorries. But the
time-honoured firm of Cobb & Co. is still supreme as
carriers of mails and passengers, and runs services to
many places, including Winton, Muttaburra, and some
of the principal stations.


JUNDAH.
•
Following down the Thomson River for about 175
miles the township ol Jundah is reached on the bank
of the river, about 35 miles before it junctions with the
Barcoo and about 50 miles north-west of the railway
from Blackall to the line that is to be made to
Camooweal from Charleville. Jundah is about 230
miles west or south-west from Blackall. It is a small
town in the midst of very rich pastoral country, sur-
rounded by large stations such as “Stonehenge,” “War-
breccan, Hammond Downs,” “M'elford,” “Curra-
willa,” and “Connemara.”
North-west of Jundah are opal mines which
have produced many beautiful specimens. The
opal is found in a low ridge that actually divides the
that way while the railway connecting link of 128 miles
remains open from Longreach to Winton.
Being the terminus of a railway to the coast,
Winton commands the trade over an extensive area
south and north and west to the Hamilton, Burke, and
Georgina Rivers. Some of the largest and wealthiest
stations in Queensland trade with Winton, including
“Elderslie,” “Kynujaa,” “Oondooroo,” “Ayrshire
Downs,” “Dagworth,” “Cork,” “Evesham,” “Vin-
dex,” “Sesbania,” “Brighton Downs,” and many others.
The chief advantage of the route to the coast by
Longreach over the Townsville seaport lies in the fact
that Rockhampton is 400 miles nearer Brisbane,
reducing the sea freight to that extent on goods and
giving passengers from the West the privilege of going
BORE ON “ELDERSLIE.” NEAR WINTON.
watershed of the Thomson and Farrar Creek, which runs
into Coopers Creek. The town is situated in the midst
of open downs country, with a dry healthy climate and
an average rainfall of 17 inches.
The word Jundah, pronounced “Joonda, ” was the
aboriginal name for “woman.”
WINTON.
The town stands on a tributary of the Diamantina,
the Western river, 128 miles north-west by road from
Longreach, 132 miles from Hughenden, and 368 from
Townsville. To Rockhampton it is 128 miles by road to
Longreach and 428 miles by rail, a total of 556 miles.
The Townsville route to the coast has therefore an
advantage of 188 miles, and all traffic must come and go
direct to Brisbane by train, or else shortening the sea
voyage by 400 miles and avoiding the Townsville sea
journey, which is not desirable in the stormy months of
the year, January, February, and March.
Winton has profited considerably by the advent of
a great number of excellent grazing selectors who have
settled on the resumed areas of the various stations.
The population of the district at the present time is
about 3,300, being governed by a Shire Council.
Though only 614 ft. above sea level, the climate is
very genial and healthy, and has a special benefit for
persons afflicted with throat and chest troubles.
Coaches run out to Boulia, 220 miles south-west
on the Burke River, a tributary of the Georgina, and
also to Kynuna, which is 90 miles north-west on the
head of the Diamantina.


The ARCHERS of “Gracemere.”
Few names are associated with a
more interesting series of historical
events than is that of the “Grace-
mere’' family, of which Mr. Robert
Stubbs Archer, son of the late David
Archer, its founder, is the head.
Tradition has it that the first direct
Archer ancestor of whom record is
preserved was wounded when fighting
with Cromwell’s forces in the battle
of Stirling, and being left in Scotland
when the English retired, settled in
Perth, his descendants being re-
corded as substantial shipowners of
North Britain during the latter part
of the eighteenth century. Later
records show that they suffered
severe financial reverses during the
Napoleonic wars, and that subse-
quently, in 1825, William Archer,
the grandfather of Mr. R. S.
Archer, of “Gracemere,” emigrated
from Scotland to Norway, which
then became the family headquarters.
Many of the name still help to
people the Land of the Midnight
Sun. The late David Archer, the
Australian pioneer, accompanied his
father and brothers to Norway, and
for long resided at “Tolderodden,”
Larvik, the old home of the family
there. On reaching manhood he
sailed for Australia, and in the year
1833 landed in Sydney, whence he
proceeded to “Wallarawang” Sta-
tion, then included in the ownership
of his maternal uncle, the late
Edward Walker, of whose proper-
ties, “Wallarawang” and “Louie,”
he became general manager, a
capacity in which he acted until
1840, when he formed the firm of
D. Archer & Co. His advent to the
country was followed by that of
eight of his brothers, all of whom
finally returned to the Old World
after having contributed in no small
measure to the prosjmrity of the
Continent, and been more or less
identified with the early pastoral
development of Queensland, where
David and Thomas Archer settled in
1841. When the former relinquished
the general managership of Mr.
Walker’s properties in 1840 he col-
lected a mob of sheep, picked chiefly
from the well-known “Louie” flock,
and accompanied by Thomas started
from the Castlereagh River en route
to the Darling Downs, travelling via
New England, where a twelve
months’ delay occurred owing to an
epidemic among the stock. On
eventually arriving on the Downs
and finding the pick of the country
already selected he pushed on to the
Brisbane River watershed, where
the McConnels, the first pioneers of
this district, had settled during the
MR. D. ARCHER.
previous year. Here, in 1841, the
brothers established as a sheep and
cattle holding “Durundur,” which
three years later they sold to one
of the McConnel family. They then
took up “Cooyar”and“ Emu Creek”
Stations, and subsequently, in 1847,
continuing in the van of settlement,
became the owners of “Coonam-
bula” and “Eidsvold,” in the Bur-
nett district. In 1852, after nearly
twenty years’ sojourn in the country,
David Archer returned to England.
Several of his brothers remained in
pastoral pursuits, and in 1853 two,
Messrs. Charles and William Archer,
accompanied by a white stockman
and two black boys entered upon a
journey of exploration from the
Burnett to country previously dis-
covered by Leichhardt, from whom
they learned of the probable pre-
sence of a large river near the coast,
the scientific knowledge of their
informant having led him to assume
this waterway’s existence from the
convergent courses of the Dawson
and Mackenzie Rivers. The Messrs.
Archer, following the course of the
Burnett to “Rawbelle” and thence
northwards, broke their journey at
Ramies” Station, thence the most
northerly settlement of Australia and
occupied by the Messrs. Leith-Bay.
They were here joined by a
Mr. Spencer, in whose honour,
travelling due north, they named
Mount Spencer. From Mount Spen-
cer they steered a somewhat easterly
course, and coming upon the stream
now known as the Dee, followed it
until they arrived at the chain of
hills later named the Dee Range,
from one of whose peaks they viewed
a glorious panorama of ocean and
rich pastures, and, flowing seawards,
the majestic river, which, though
visioned by the renowned explorer,
it had been left to them to discover
and designate. Making in its direc-
tion, the little party came upon the
fine lake to which was afterwards
given the name of “Gracemere,” and
finally arrived at the river at a point
some miles above the present city,
which was included in the area
originally taken up by the Archer
family for pastoral purposes—a hold-
ing consisting of 900 square miles of
territory with a 70-mile frontage to
the Fitzroy. To this holding they
gave the now historical title of
“Gracemere.” When the bearings
of the country had been taken for
purposes of selection, Messrs.
Charles and William Archer re-
turned to the Burnett, but the
family made no move northwards
until July 2, 1855, when the former,
with his brother James, led a party
of fourteen Europeans, four native
police and their gins, and four black
boys to the “Gracemere” country,
and brought for the formation of
the run several thousand sheep,
loadings, drawn by bullock teams,
of all the gear and equipment neces-
sary for the establishment of a
station in hitherto unsettled country.
They arrived in the Fitzroy Valley
about the middle of August, fresh
provisions being then daily expected
by a cutter (the “Elida”), the build-
ing of which it had been arranged
Mr. Colin Archer should super-
intend in Maryborough, afterwards
bringing it thence up the Fitzroy
River in time to eujDplement the
stores brought by the overland party,
who, owing to the unavoidable delay
of the cutter, had for several weeks
been living upon saltless mutton and
rice only. Short commons, however,
were ended on September 2, Mr!
Colin Archer, with the assistance
of Mr. Elliott—who followed the
Archers in the march of settlement,
and one sailor having sailed the craft
from Maryborough this being the


first vessel to navigate the Fitzroy
River. The formation of the station
went rapidly ahead, land being
cleared, huts and yards erected, and
by November the first clipping was
despatched by the “Elida” to
Maryborough, whence it was tran-
shipped to a larger craft for Sydney.
The Archer brothers named the
Fitzroy River after the Governor of
New South Wales, of which Colony
Queensland was then a part. From
these first pioneers and Mr. Wise-
man, Crown Lands Commissioner of
the Leichhardt district, Rockhamp-
ton also received its name. The
-personnel of the firm owning “Grace-
mere” in the fifties as Archer & Co.
was comprised by Messrs. David,
Charles, William, Thomas, Archi-
bald, Colin, and James Archer. Of
these, five —Charles, William, Colin,
J ames, and Archibald—were at
different times in charge of the pro-
perty, which became renowned for
its blood stock, the famous “Grace-
mere” cattle stud being formed in
1864 with bulls imported from Eng-
land, and strengthened by the intro-
duction of other sires from the
Homeland in 1870 and 1888. The
Queensland properties held by
Archer & Co. included “Minnie
Downs,” on the Barcoo, and “St.
Helens,” acquired in 1872 and 1891
respectively. The latter was sold in
1903, after the great drought of the
period had decimated a fine herd of
8,000 head. Dairying on an elaborate
scale was also carried on by this
firm. In 1899 a re-arrangement was
effected in the partnership, which
was reduced to three members, after
the death of whom, their executors,
members of the next generation of
the family, formed the limited com-
pany which is now in ownership of
“Gracemere.” ROBERT STUBBS
ARCHER, head of Archer Brothers
Ltd., formed in 1884, in conjunction
with Mr. J. Archer, the firm of
R. S. & J. Archer, which was sub-
sequently joined by the late Charles
Archer, and later, on the death of
Charles, by Mr. E. W. Archer.
This firm, which was amalgamated
with the firm of Archer Brothers
Ltd., “Gracemere,” on July 1,
1916, acquired “Coolibah,” “Tar-
ginnie,” and “Torsdale,” the last-
mentioned, like “Gracemere,” being
the home of a noted stud which was
formed from Hereford cows pur-
chased from the latter station.
These two studs were later worked
in conjunction, and for many years
have been widely known throughout
the Commonwealth for the produc-
tion of high-class herd bulls of the
Hereford, shorthorn, and red poll
strains. The brothers have special-
ized in both beef and dairy breeds,
“Gracemere” being recorded a few
years back as milking between 600
and 700 cows. David Archer, the
founder of the line under the
Southern Cross, married in England
Susan Stubbs, a lady of Irish origin,
by whom he had eight sons and two
daughters. He resided in England
from 1853 until his death at Croy-
don, Surrey, in the year 1900 at the
age of eighty-four. His eldest son,
Robert Stubbs Archer, of “Grace-
mere,” married Alice Marwedel, a
daughter of an old Queensland
pioneer, who resided on the Darling
Downs for more than a quarter of a
century. Two sons and a daughter
are the issue of the union, the sons,
David and Archibald, representing
the third generation of a family of
Australian pastoralists. During the
Great War the elder, David, spent
three years at the Western Front,
serving chiefly with the artillery.
Other descendants of the first Archer
Brothers also distinguished them-
selves in the firing line, and Cedric,
a son of James Archer, met his
death in action. Of the Archers
who have contributed to the political
history of Queensland, one, Archi-
bald Archer, was member for
Blackall and Rockhampton at respec-
tive periods. He was appointed
Agent-General in the seventies, and
while occupying that office presented
to the Imperial authorities a petition
for the separation of Central Queens-
land. This petition not finding
favour with the Brisbane Govern-
ment, Mr. Archer resigned from
office to prove his sympathy with
the aims of his political friends in
the Centre and North. He subse-
quently acted as Colonial Treasurer
and Secretary for Public Instruc-
tion under the Mcllwraith Adminis-
tration. Thomas Archer was also
Agent-General for some years, re-
ceiving the appointment in the
eighties. Edward Walker Archer, a
brother of Mr. R. S. Archer, of
“Gracemere,” represented Capri -
cornia in the Federal Parliament for
three years, and subsequently became
State member for Normanby.
The late JAMES STEWART,
whose career in Queensland typifies
the years of effort and the achieve-
ment which the word “success” im-
plies, was well called the “father”
of commerce in Rockhampton, of
which centre he was a resident for
sixty years and a prominent business
man during the whole of that period.
This notable pioneer has but recently
crossed the Great Divide, and until
the time of his death, which occurred
in January, 1923, personally directed
the running of the large emporium
which he founded when the prosper-
ous capital of Central Queensland
was a straggling settlement marked
by a few primitive buildings and
rough tracks—the sites of the pre-
sent busy streets—in which the
remains of forest giants might yet
be seen. Born in the village of
Spittlefield, on the Tay, Perthshire,
on July 29, 1837, he was a son of
the late Charles Stewart, who sprang
from an old Highland line of Aber-
feldie engaged in Perthshire with
farming and stock raising, the call-
ings of many generations of his pro-
genitors. Mr. James Stewart in-
clined to the drapery business, how-
ever, and on the conclusion of his
school days which were spent in
Spittlefield, was apprenticed to a
house in Perth. He was then in his
early teens. After some years of
apprenticeship he removed to Glas-
gow, with the view of enlarging his
knowledge of the trade. On arriving
at his twentieth year he decided to
put his fortunes to the test in the
far-distant Continent of Australia,
and accordingly, in the late fifties
or early sixties, embarked for Vic-
toria, where his brother, Mr. Alex-
ander Stewart (later for many years
pi eminently known in Brisbane
commercial circles and whose death
occurred in the year 1920) was
already settled and engaged in busi-
ness. He followed his trade in Mel-
bourne and on the Murray, and
after four years spent in the South
came to Queensland, where his
brother had preceded him and
opened up in business in partnership
with Mr. Hemmant, founding the
firm of Stewart & Hemmant. From
Brisbane Mr. James Stewart pro-
ceeded to Rockhampton to establish
there a branch of this business, and
rented premises in Denham Street
on the site now occupied by the
Bank of New South Wales. For a
short time he carried on in the


original building, which had been
erected by Mr. A. F. Wood, a
pioneer surveyor who laid out the
town in 1858, but as tire firm
prospered, secured plans for a new
establishment. To this he removed
in 1864, and the old house now
forms a part of the present premises
of James Stewart, Ltd., which
occupy nearly an acre of ground in
East and Bolsover Streets. Its
solidity and excellent state of pre-
servation speak well for the work-
manship of the period. Within a
few years of the foundation of the
original firm Mr. Hemmant retired
and Mr. Stewart purchased the busi-
ness on his own account. Shortly
after the change was effected he was
joined by Mr. Edward Seymour
Lucas, with whom he established
the firm of Stewart & Lucas, which
existed for many years. Eventually,
on the retirement of Mr. Lucas, the
business received the title of James
Stewart & Co., which was altered on
March 8, 1916, to James Stewart,
Ltd., when a limited company, com-
prised of Mr. James Stewart as
Governing Director, Robert Mac-
farlane, James Stewart Steele, John
Macfarlane, Alexander McMillan,
Robert Cecil Boland, and Jane
Stewart, was formed. Under the
merchandise were represented in the
many departments (including
drapery, tailoring, furniture, mat-
tress making, etc.) housed in his
Rockhampton emporium, which he
MR. J. STEWART.
actively superintended to the last,
his strong and kindly personality
helping as always the effectiveness of
the Rockhampton district, and for
several years was chairman of the
Mount Morgan Gold Mining Co.,
having been the last survivor of the
band formed for the development of
this mine in the early days. In
various directions he lias spent
heavily in developmental operations,
and he has grub-staked an untold
number of prospectors. In the former
connection it should be mentioned
that he jmt a dredging jjlant,
which cost thousands of pounds, in
Crocodile Creek, his faith in his
venture being such that on one
occasion he refused £lO,OOO for a
half share in the proposition, though
up to that time it had cost him
£ll,OOO. The project was doomed
to failure, however, as is shown by
the old hull yet to be seen in Croco-
dile Creek. Rockhampton has had
no more liberal benefactor than Mr.
Stewart, and many a man owes his
first lift towards independence or
prosperity to his goodness of heart,
while many another, with whom
Fortune had dealt harshly, was
given by him the chance needed to
make good. Innumerable acts of
generosity, performed unostenta-
tiously and known only to such as
he benefited, stand to his credit.

direction of the founder branches
of his business were extended to
Mount Morgan, Blackall, Bar-
oaldine, and Longreach, and in
course of time all lines of
his employes and contributing in no
small degree to the high standard of
efficiency displayed throughout his
warehouse. He has been one of the
mainstays of the mining industry in
which his name is associated is the
Rockhampton Technical College,
which stands on land which was a
free gift from him to the towns-
people. The Presbyterian Church, of


which he was a most prominent
member, has been a recipient of his
bounty and consistent support since
its inception in the town in the six-
ties. He was a man of strict in-
tegrity and had a keen knowledge of
human nature. For over half a
century he was a member of the
Masonic craft. In the early days of
Rockhampton his was the only estab-
lishment in town that did not close
its doors on race days, and Mr.
Stewart was the only business man
of the period who refrained from
attendance at race meetings. This
fact did not preclude his employes
from participating in the sport, they
being granted the holiday on alter-
nate occasions. Historical interest
attaches to the home which he occu-
pied for so many years. It was built
in the early sixties for Mr. James
Leith-Hay, of old “Rannes” Sta-
tion, and was at one time used as a
bank. Mr. Stewart married on
March 5, 1874, Jane, daughter of
the late Thomas Finney (who was
prominent among the commercial
pioneers of Brisbane), and sister of
Mr. Tom Finney, of Brisbane. This
lady was one of a family of twenty-
four, of whom three only now sur-
vive. She shared faithfully the
vicissitudes of her husband’s career,
adapting herself to the primitive
conditions of Rockhampton in its
infancy and ever assisting him by
her unfailing sympathy, advice, and
support.
SIDNEY WILLIAMS, Dul-
wich Hill, Sydney, the proprietor
and founder of the Rockhampton
and Sydney branches of the well-
known engineering firm of Williams
Ltd., and the inventor of the Comet
windmill, which has established its
popularity all over the continent.
Born in London on July 25, 1851,
and educated at Low-Leyton, Essex,
Mr. Williams comes of an old Lon-
don commercial family, his forbears
having successively engaged in busi-
ness in the world’s metropolis for
centuries. He was trained as an
architect, and at the age of twenty
left England for Australia, landing
in Melbourne in the year 1871. Here
he found no opening in his profes-
sion and took the first employment
that offered, being glad to earn ss.
a day as a labourer. Very shortly
after his arrival, learning of the
possibilities of the mining industry
in Bendigo—then in existence as a
gold-mining centre for a little over
a decade—he proceeded to that field.
From Bendigo he joined the rush to
Charters Towers, where a quantity
of payable gold had been recently
discovered at the base of a small tor,
or hillock, and a diggings proclaimed
by Warden Charters, hence the name
of Charters Tors, which in time
became Charters Towers. After
spending some time at Charters
Towers, Mr. Williams became
engaged as an assistant in the iron-
mongery trade in Toowoomba, where
he remained for a year or two. He
next proceeded to Townsville and
there secured a position in a store
owned by Messrs. Burns, Philp, and
Co. Desiring to try his luck at
farming, he relinquished this post
and took up, near Alligator Creek
township, in the vicinity of Mount
Elliott, a selection which, three
months later, he sold at a profit.
He then directed his steps to Rock-
hampton, where, as a counter hand,
he again secured employment in the
ironmongery business. While thus
engaged, he saw in one of the news-
papers an advertisement calling for
competitive designs for a boys’ and
girls’ grammar school. In answer
to the advertisement he sent a plan
of the projected building, and
shortly afterwards received an in-
timation that his design had been
selected from those of twenty other
competitors. For this plan, from
which the grammar school now
standing in Rockhampton was
erected, he was given a premium of
about £7OO. In the year 1879, with
the money thus earned, Mr. Wil-
liams, in conjunction with his
brother, Herbert, started the
engineering and ironmongery busi-
ness which was run under their joint
ownership for a period. The
engineering branch was under his
personal direction, and flourished
and expanded until it was found
necessary to establish a branch
works in Brisbane and a warehouse
in Townsville, and, three years ago,
the engineering works which cover
an acre of ground at Dulwich Hill,
Sydney. In the busy season upwards
of 200 employes are engaged by the
firm of hydraulic engineers of which
Mr. Williams is principal, and their
operations embrace the manufacture
of pastoral machinery, including
windmills and pumps capable of
raising as much as 200,000 gallons
per day. Mr. Williams invented the
Comet windmill when the sub-
artesian resources of Australia were
becoming generally recognized and
availed of by pastoralists. He at
once saw the necessity for economic-
ally worked and especially adapted
machinery for raising these supplies,
a 16-ft. mill being about the largest
produced at the time, and not cap-
able of pumping to the very great
depth at which sub-artesian water is
often procured. Before long the
Comet, which he designed with the
assistance of his eldest son Arthur,
was placed before the public, and
since then has been manufactured in
various sizes with diameters ranging
up to 35 ft. The Comet is capable
of pumping from a depth of 600 ft.
sufficient water for 1,200 bullocks.
Comet windmills, which are to be
found all over Australia, are irri-
gating large areas of land in the
Burdekin district, where they pump
upwards of a quarter of a million
gallons daily, thus ensuring crops
against the effects of drought. Mr.
Williams, in the midst of a very
busy life, has found time for public
work. He was Mayor of Rockhamp-
ton for two years, and a member of
the Hospital Board, a trustee of the
Boys’ and Girls’ Grammar School,
president of the School of Arts, and
otherwise active in the communal
interests during his sojourn in that
city. He married in the year 1880
Lydia, daughter of the late Alfred
T. Wood, a Queensland agent of the
old A.S.ISr. Co., and he has a family
of four sons and four daughters, all
of whom were born in Rockhampton.
The sons, who are qualified engineers,
are engaged with their father in
business, the eldest, Mr. Arthur
Williams, being general manager,
and resident in Rockhampton.
Three wholly devoted themselves to
the service of their country during
the Great War, the second son,
George, who was in America at the
declaration of hostilities, having pro-
ceeded to Canada and there enlisted,
remaining on active service until the
Armistice was signed. His younger
brothers, Messrs. Reginald and Wal-
lace Williams, were chiefly engaged
in munition making while the great
struggle lasted. Mr. Sidney Wil-
liams’ eldest daughter married
Lieut.-Col. A. R. Woolcock, who
saw considerable service during the
same war and gained many distinc-
tions, including the Croix de Guerre
and the D.S.O. Lieut.-Col. Wool-
cock is the present secretary of the
company of Williams Ltd., and is
also in charge of the Military Dis-
trict of Rockhampton.


JAMES WALLACE McKEN-
ZIE, “Campsie Grove,” Rockhamp-
ton, and of “Melrose” Station, near
Morinish, was born at Astanaracon,
near Tobermory, Island of Mull,
Scotland, in the year 1852. He is a
son of the late John McKenzie, a
very early pioneer of the Fitzroy
River watershed, to which the Mc-
Kenzie family made their advent in
the sixties. At Tobermory, the late
gentleman had been engaged as a
railway checker, thus supporting his
wife and children until representa-
tions as to the possibility of improv-
ing their circumstances in Australia
prompted his emigration. These
representations came from friends
named McGavin, who contemplated
sailing for the young Continent and
suggested that the two families
should join forces. This Mr. Mc-
Kenzie agreed to and passage was
taken to Moreton Bay, Queensland,
by the “Ellensleigh,” which arrived
at her destination in 1862. From
Moreton Bay the party moved on to
Rockhampton district, where, in the
vicinity of Laurel Bank, the Me-
Gavins took up a property, calling
it “Dalgarga.” After some time
spent at “Dalgarga” with their
friends, the McKenzies became es-
tablished on the land in the same
neighbourhood, Mr. John McKenzie
having taken up 160 acres under a
land grant and named his property
“Campsie Hill.” Development for
dairying was inaugurated, and from
1866 onwards, his efforts, assisted by
those of his family, were rewarded
with considerable success, so that in
time 1,800 acres on the Fitzroy
River were added to his landed pos-
sessions, the later acquirement being
named “Caliorum.” The original
pioneer died in December of the year
1880 and his property was divided
between his two sons, John and
James, and his daughter Jessie (now
Mrs. Montague Beak), John retain-
ing “Campsie Hill,” while James
became sole owner of “Caliorum.”
In 1889, after devoting many years
to the work of production in his
adopted country, John McKenzie
also crossed the Great Divide. After
his arrival in Central Queensland in
the sixties, James McKenzie, then
only a lad, obtained employment in
the cotton industry, assisting in
picking the first crop of cotton pro-
duced in Central Queensland, grown
by Mr. William Orr, of “Laurel
Bank.” Work on the home property
under the direction of his father and
varied with a certain amount of
droving, occupied las youth and
early manhood; and as a lad ho
visited New South Wales, returning
overland with horses. Dairying at
“Campsie Hill” engaged him
after the death of the founder
of the family, and to the in-
dustry he attributes the possibility
MR. J. W. MCKENZIE.
of later prosperity. In return for
hard work and unflagging persever-
ance he met with considerable suc-
cess, and in a short time was enabled
to add to his possessions by the pur-
chase of “Melrose” (an area of
5,000 acres on the Fitzroy) and an
adjoining leasehold of sixty square
miles. These purchases heralded
more important pastoral undertak-
ings and a prosperity which has
withstood many setbacks brought
about by unfavourable seasons, stock
epidemics, adverse legislation and
other causes. At time of writing, as
a result of his hard work, business
acumen and foresight, there are in
addition to the original 5,000 acres
on “Melrose,” 15,000 acres of free-
hold and selected country. In 1904
he took up “Junee,” a holding (pre-
viously held by Mr. O. C. J. Beard-
more, late of “Tooloorabah” Station)
of seventy square miles on the Mac-
kenzie River. A bush fire had swept
this country, destroying the home-
stead, stockyards and miles of fenc-
ing, all of which he had to re-erect.
He stocked “Junee” from “Mel-
rose” and carried on until 1918 when
lie again suffered severe loss, on this
occasion through a flood which sub-
merged parts of the run that had
never before been under water and
claimed as victims many cattle that,
unable to withstand the force of the
current, were washed over the fences.
This was the great flood that des-
troyed the town of Clermont. After
this visitation the station was sold
and “Charleyvue,” near Dingo, pur-
chased. “Charleyvue” was originally
taken up in 1866 by the late Moses
W 7 afer, from whose estate it was
bought by Mr. McKenzie’s nephews,
and he in turn purchased it from
them. He next bought in the same
locality “Blackdown” Tableland,
comprising sixty square miles of
country unexcelled both in the qual-
ity of its pasturage and the timber
which it carries. Shortly after
acquiring “Blackdown” he became
the owner of 10,000 acres near Wal-
ton, on the Queensland Central Rail-
way Line. As illustrating the trend
of latter day politics, it should be
mentioned that Mr. McKenzie paid
a retrospective rent of £7OO for coun-
try which he leases at the rate of £2
per mile, and held in earlier years
at a rental of 15s. IGd. per mile.
During the war he paid War Profit
Tax of 75 per cent, on all his cattle
sales. Like all cattle men, he has
suffered considerable loss through
the serious fall in stock values, but,
nevertheless, has been able to build
homes and give his five sons and
three daughters a comfortable start
in life. Of his sons, George, the
eldest, lives at “Boolburra.,” John
at “Charleyvue,” James at “Wal-
ton,” and David and Alick at “Mel-
rose.” In addition to his pastoral
interests he owns “Campsie Grove,”
a beautiful town house and property
containing four acres and occupying
a fine site on the Athelstone Range,
Rockhampton. From its well laid-
out grounds, where citrus, mango,
pear and other orchard trees thrive,
is commanded a fine view of the town
with its picturesque river, lagoons
and encircling ranges. Its owner
married in the year 1875 a W 7 elsh
lady, who, a. daughter of the late
David Jones, was born in 1858 and
brought by her parents to Austra-
lia by the “Persia,” the first emi-
grant ship sent to Central Queens-
land ports. Mr. Jones arrived in
Rockhampton in 1861 and took up
“Table Mountain” Station, near
Mount Morgan, where the family has
ever since resided. A son and a
daughter of Mr. McKenzie married
into the family of Mr. Edgar,
another pioneer of the Rockhampton
district.


EDWARD SEYMOUR LUCAS,
Managing Director of the firm of
E. S. Lucas Limited, was born in
London, England, on April 14,
1844. Mr. E. S. Lucas was educated
at a school in London, and on the
termination of his studies entered a
drapery establishment in the city.
He continued to gain experience of
the trade of which he is now a pro-
minent Rockhampton representative
until attaining his late teens, when
he made up his mind to try his for-
tune in Australia. He sailed from
England by the “Young Australia,”
which accomplished the passage to
Queensland in eighty-four days,
about then the fastest time on record
for a sailing vessel covering the same
distance. Landing in Brisbane in
the year 1862 he entered the employ
of Messrs. Stewart & Hemmant, and
at the end of his first twelve months
in the country was transferred to the
appointment of chief assistant in the
firm’s Rockhampton branch, under
the late James Stewart. Some few
years subsequently, the Rock-
hampton business of Messrs. Stewart
and Hemmant was purchased by
Messrs. James Stewart and E. S.
Lucas, who carried on a partnership
until the year 1880, when the latter
retired therefrom and opened up
independently in his present pre-
mises, which occupy in East Street
a fine block that is largely made up
of freehold purchased by him in the
early years of his venture. For
thirty-five years Mr. Lucas con-
tinued sole director of the multi-
tudinous alfairs constituting his busi-
ness, the expansion of which necessi-
tated, in 1915, its conversion into a
limited company concern. His sons
were then admitted into partnership,
the eldest and third becoming co-
directors. Throughout his career
Mr. Lucas has. invested more or less
heavily in -mining, - meeting with
varying success - in -the industry,
though total results have showed that
his ventures in this direction have
yielded considerably less than the
whole capital invested. He had large
interests in Crocodile Creek in the
sixties, and in Ridgelands, Morinish,
Cowarral, and other fields. His
initiative led him, as far back as
1875, to test the commercial possi-
bilities of mango cultivation, for
which purpose he imported plants
of forty different varieties from
India, the fruit of which was sold
locally and sent to Brisbane factories.
From this property, “Rockonia,”
which carried about 1,600 trees, the
district received its best varieties of
the species. Mr, Lucas has been a
most active participant in various
movements whose trend is for the
advancement of the city and the dis-
trict of which he has been so long a
resident. In the early days he was a
member of the Gogango Shire
Council and for several years held a
seat on the board. For the four years
dating from 1903 he was president
of the Rockhampton Chamber of
Commerce. He is an adherent
MR. E. S. LUCAS.
of the Established Church of Eng-
land, and did much, when Rock-
hampton was in its infancy, to for-
ward the interests of that com-
munion, which, throughout his life,
has received his active support. His
chief predilection in the way of
recreation is bowls and gardening,
and he is a member and one of the
founders of the Rockhampton Bowl-
ing Club. His sons, Ernest Sey-
mour and Francis Arthur, are, as
already stated, directors of the firm
of E. S. Lucas, Limited, whilst
Herbert Harrold Killough is in
business on his own account at
Blackall, Central Queensland, and
the youngest, Roland Thomas, is
secretary of the company.
JAMES O’GRADY DUNNE,
J.P., “Mentone,” Rockhampton,
was born in 1846, in Edenderry, on
the borders of Kildare and King’s
County. He is a son of the late
James Dunne, who was engaged as
a gentleman farmer in the environs
of that town, and who eventually
settled in Australia, bringing capital
to the country and living chiefly in
retirement during his sojourn here,
though in the early days he invested
in land near Rockhampton. The
family which Mr. James Dunne
founded under the Southern Cross
may trace its crest and history back
to the period of “Con of the Hun-
dred Battles.” Tradition has it that
the crest was worn with honour dur-
ing the Wars of the Cross, in the
course of which a knight of the line
being wounded, was succoured by a
Saracen lady, whom he afterwards
married and brought to Ireland.
Among paintings which have been
preserved from generation to genera-
tion by the lady’s descendants, are
to be seen occasional representations
of strikingly dark beauty which tell
of this eastern ancestry. Perhaps
one of the most treasured of the
family’s possessions is a string of
amber beads presented for prowess
in tournament to the knight men-
tioned, or another ancestor, during
the Crusade. James Dunne married
a Miss O’Grady, a descendant of one
of the most ancient of notable Irish
families. He died in Rockhampton
in the sevenfies, leaving a son, Mr.
J. O’Grady Dunne, and two
daughters. At the time of his
death his eldest daughter, Mrs!
Birmingham, who was a widow,
resided with him, and years later
this lady’s son was engaged in the
printing trade in Brisbane. Her
daughter at the time of her death
was the Superior of the Convent of
Mercy in Rockhampton. James
O’Grady Dunne, the subject of this
review, at the age of fifteen accom-
panied his parents and other mem-
bers of his family from Ireland, the
voyage, which was one of four
months’ duration, being made in the
“Feiry Star,” a sailing ship. The
most exciting incident on the journey
was an outbreak of fire, which, for-
tunately, was discovered by young
Dunne, before it had done irrepar-
able damage, though it was suffi-
ciently serious to call into service all
the ship’s pumps. Strange to relate,
this ship was burned at sea during
her return journey, the catastrophe
being due to the undue heating


and ignition of a cargo of damp
wool, and the occasion of the death
of the captain and some of the crew.
The Dunne family were among the
passengers booked for Rockhampton,

were astonished at the number of
blacks lining the river banks.
When the boat anchored several of
these came aboard and displayed an
interest in the new arrivals which
was only rivalled in intensity by that
which their dark skins and excited
gestures aroused in the whites. In
Rockhampton the late James Dunne
entered into the possession of land
containing some 300 to 400 acres, for
which he had paid £1 per acre.
This property was immediately put
under development for farming and
grazing purposes and worked to the
best advantage in the face of most
adverse conditions until droughts,
insufficient scope and the low price
of cattle—which varied from 7s. 6d.
to £1 10s. per head —proved insuper-
able barriers to success, and finally
resulted in severe financial loss to
the original pioneer and his family.
When the loss of the holding even-
tuated, his son, Mr. J. O’Grady
Dunne, essayed to make a living on
the diggings, his first move in this
direction being at Crocodile. On
this field he had some exciting ex-
periences due to trouble which arose
between the diggers and the Chinese,
the latter, being in large numbers,
strenuously objecting, according to
their own ideas of warfare, to the
miners putting down shafts on land
which they had under cultivation,
but through which the lead ran.
From Crocodile he went to Morinish,
but, Dame Fortune withholding her
favours here, he proceeded to the
Rosewood diggings, where no better
luck awaited him, though con-
tinued to strenuously employ his
energies on this field until his whole
capital was exhausted. The spirit of
camaraderie which distinguished the
better type of that class to which so
much of the country’s development
is due, came to his aid at this junc-
ture, for with others who had sunk
their all at Morinish, he was ten-
dered by the more fortunate miners

recently been discovered. This was
in 1867, and though he opened up
on the Gympie field some reefs which
later proved to be rich in metal,
their possibilities failed to materi-
alize while in Mr. Dunne’s posses-
sion From Gympie he visited other
mineral-bearing centres in Queens-
land, and finally went to* Gulgong in
New South Wales. Here he made
one of a quartette of which he has
preserved many happy memories;
his mates, Messrs. Power, Court and
Bent, being sportsmen all, and sons
of representative families in Eng-
land. The first-mentioned was the
son of the then Governor of India,
and he and his companions excelled
as amateur boxers, swordsmen and
marksmen. These four did fairly
well at Gulgong, and, when satisfied
with results, Mr. Dunne returned to
Queensland, choosing Rockhampton
as the scene of his next operations.
He arrived here in 1872 and estab-
lished a business which, owing to a
small corner made in flour, very
shortly placed him on a still better
footing; and in the following year,
1873, he was able to make another
start in the pastoral industry. This
was effected in partnership with Mr.
Edward Kelly, by the acquirement
of land on the historical “Grace-
mere” run, near Rockhampton.
Messrs. Dunne and Kelly went in for
breeding cattle and blood horses and
did very well until 1875, when the
drought of that year decimated their
herd and claimed as victims the
majority of their horses. Fortu-
nately, a few steers and cows were
saved, and with these the partners
again bred up. By 1878, good man-
agement, assisted by the wonderfully
recuperative powers of the country,
had once more placed them on a
sound footing, Mr. Dunne having in
the interval operated considerably in
cattle dealing, buying store bullocks
in Queensland and selling in New
South Wales, and frequently making
as much as £1 per head on a herd
of a thousand, without even having

inspected the stock. The bank fail-
ure and tick pest of 1880 were the
next adverse circumstances in the big
list of opposing conditions which have
chequered his career, but though ex-
periencing tremendous losses and


threatened with overwhelming dis-
aster, he again pulled through. In
the year 1900 he purchased on be-
half of the firm, “Banksia,” a
station formed of about 250 square

miles of leasehold and 42,000 acres
of freehold, and carrying a herd of
6,000. He paid £lO,OOO for this
property, which proved a splendid in-
vestment. In 1907, Messrs. Dunne
and Kelly purchased “Wooroona,” a
property containing 780 square miles
of excellent cattle country and cap-
able of carrying 15,000 head. The
wisdom of this purchase was also jus-
tified by the big financial results
accruing to' the firm, which existed
until the year 1911, when the death
of Mr. Kelly occurred, rendering a
re-adjustment of affairs necessary.
The executors, of whom Mr. Dunne
was one, agreed that “Wooroona”
and “Ulam” should be retained by
Mr. Dunne and that “Banksia” and
“Gracemere” be allotted to the
legatees, and that the stock should
be equally divided. Among the pro-
perties already detailed as stocked by
the gentleman under review should
be mentioned “Killara” and
“Arden.” He has bought and sold
many stations, several of consider-
able importance. In the year 1917,
he made his estates the basis of a
company, in which his sons became
joint shareholders, and the eldest,
Mr. John Edward Dunne, managing
partner. Three years later he en-
tered into well-earned retirement.
During his association with the pas-
toral world he gained considerable
repute as a breeder, his earliest suc-
cessful operations in this direction
dating back to 1873. From 1879,
when he won a silver medal with his
blood stallion, “Lothaer,” at the
Central Queensland Graziers’ and
Farmers’ Society’s Exhibition, num-
erous trophies have been awarded
him. These include a silver goblet
won by the thoroughbred stallion,
“The Rake,” at the 1880 exhibition
of the above-named society; silver
medals and silver cup with the blood
horse “Orphan” in 1883 at the Fitz-
roy Pastoral, Agricultural and Hor-
ticultural Society’s Exhibition; and
silver medals for the best shorthorn
heifer and three best blood foals in
shows held in 1883 and 1884 respec-
tively by the Central Queensland
Graziers’ and Farmers’ Society. He
secured on the former occasion a
silver medal for the best shorthorn
heifer under twelve months, and on
the latter, with “Waterwitch,” a sil-
ver medal for best blood mare. In
1887 he received the silver medal of
the Fitzroy Pastoral, Agicultural
and Horticultural Society for
“Orphan,” as best blood horse, and
in the same year a silver goblet for
the same horse as winner in the best
sire class, as well as a gold watch and
chain presented by the Central
Queensland Graziers’ and Farmers’
Society. At his home are to be' seen
several other trophies won by his

stock, as well as substantial marks
of appreciation in the shape of pre-
sentations from his fellow pastoralists
and colonists. His association with
the sporting life of the Rockhamp-
ton district began many years ago,
he being one of the early members
of the Rockhampton Race Club and
similar bodies. He was a member of
the first show committee of Rock-
hampton, and is a life member of
the Farmers’ and Graziers’ Associa-
tion and the Agricultural Associa-
tion of the city. Throughout his

career as a pastoralist he has been
a consistent supporter of many phil-
anthropic movements, and was
among those who took a prominent
part in patriotic affairs during and
after the war of 1914-18, when he
gave liberally to various funds,
When War Loans were called for,
he invested heavily in bonds. Mr.
James O’Grady Dunne married
Julia, daughter of the late Edward
Kelly, of Rockhampton, and had a
family of twelve children, of whom
four sons and four daughters sur-
vive. He may look back upon a life


brimful of incidents such as have
suggested many an Australian novel,
and upon strange experiences, among
which may be counted his acquaint-
a nee at Clermont with the gold com-
missioner, Griffiths, ere he com-
mitted the atrocious murder of his
escort for the sake of the notes they
carried. Several residents of Cler-
mont had previously counted as
friend this man of good appearance,
manners and family, whose deed was
as evil almost as any in the history
of crime, his victims having been
honourable and highly-thought-of
young men of prominent families in
the Old World. Mr. Dunne’s eldest
son, John Edward, was born in
Rockhampton in the year 1878 and
educated at the local Grammar
before the end of March, notwith-
standing that during the first few
weeks severe flood conditions had to
be contended with. He delivered the
mob minus forty-seven head only,
these being left on the roads owing
to lameness caused by the boggy
country through which the herd was
travelled. During the four years
that followed this trip he was en-
trusted with the responsibility of
buying and taking delivery of
cattle for the firm—the prices paid
at that period frequently averaging
less than HI per head with calves
thrown in. In 1900, when “Bank-
sia” was purchased, he was
appointed to its management, and
this task he carried out with exoep-
tional ability. * With indomitable
and equally heavy losses were ex-
perienced. With the return of
normal conditions, breeding from
the remnant of the old herd, which
contained a big proportion of
breeders, was begun, and in 1907 the
original strength was nearly
attained. In that year Mr. J. E.
Dunne took over, on the firm’s be-
half, “Wooroona” Station, then
recently purchased. He found this
property practically lacking in im-
provements, such as existed being in
a state of dilapidation. All this he
remedied, erecting many miles of
fencing, forming an outstation, con-
structing a dip and building drafting
and dipping yards. He also practi-
cally rebuilt the old homestead, and,
in a word, re-created “Wooroona”

School. Concluding his studies at
the age of eighteen, he went to
“Gracemere,” where his father and
Mr. Kelly had then recently ac-
quired a portion of the resumed area
of the original station. The farmer’s
dealing operations were then in full
swing, and Mr. J. E. Dunne had
thus ample opportunity of gaining
first-hand knowledge of the methods
of handling stock both on the run
and the stock routes. His first big
experience as a drover was the over-
landing of 1,000 mixed cattle from
“Ulam” to “Eton Vale.” Starting
in January, 1896, and negotiating in
turn the Dee, the Don, the Burde-
kin and several small creeks, he
covered the distance of 400 miles
pluck he fought the big drought of
1901-3, which necessitated the cut-
ting of enormous quantities of scrub
to make up for the lack of grass,
and the continual endeavour to save
stock, which, owing to their weak
state, were day after day bogged in
the partially dried waterholes. Dur-
ing this drought, the most severe in
our history, the horses had all to be
corn fed, and special hands had to
be employed to skin the cattle as
they succumbed to the arid condi-
tions. Despite his every effort,
“Banksia” emerged from the ordeal
with only 1,500 out of a herd of
5 000, faring better, nevertheless,
than any other holding in the dis-
trict, where 100 saved from 3,000
from a neglected holding to
one of the best-found pastoral pro-
perties in the Central District. In
1909, leaving a younger brother in
control of “Wooroona,” he travelled,
on behalf of Mr. E. Jowett, over the
Batheaston and Vermont country,
in the direction of Clermont,
to report upon its suitableness for
pastoral purposes. His report being
favourable, he was instructed by
Mr. Jowett to form a cattle station,
and in the pursuance of this task
selected a site for the homestead,
fenced in the home paddocks and was
successful in locating water which
had to be made available for the
stock before their advent. This
work occupied two yeans, at the end


of wliich his presence was required
at “Wooroona.” He re-assumed
control of this property in 1911 and
met with considerable success during
his long term of administration, and
from 1917, when his father formu-
lated the company of Dunne and
Sons, continued to direct affairs as
managing partner, having pre-
viously worked up the studs of
cattle and horses to the standard
which they have attained and done
much to improve the herd, which was
formed originally with blood from
the Angas Estate, South Australia,
and with bulls imported from New
Zealand. Under his direction, a
cross between the shorthorn and red
polled breeds was tried, for which
purpose red polls were secured from
the famous stud of Mr. Philip
Charley, of New South Wales. On
June 30, 1919, he sold out his in-
terests to his three younger brothers,
and in the following year purchased
“Killara” from Mr. James Dunne,
since when he has continued to per-
sonally conduct this property. An
expert judge of horses, he has owned
several well-known performers,
among them being “Albro,” with
which he was successful on the Bris-
bane, Rockhampton and Charters
Towers turfs. He bred the success-
ful winner, “Pacific,” and owned,
among other good blood stallions,
“Eclipse” by “Archie,” a well-
known racehorse and the sire of
good performers on the Sydney
courses. Mr. J. E. Dunne was for
some years a member of the Dua-
ringa Shire Council, and is a Justice
of the Peace of long standing.
Debarred from active participation
in the war of 1914-18 owing to a
slight disablement of his left arm
due to a fall from his horse, he
ardently assisted all patriotic move-
ments set afoot in the district during
the course of the struggle. A keen
sportsman, all forms of manly sport
have claimed his interest and he has
occupied the chairmanship of the
Duaringa Jockey Club and a mem-
bership of the Rockhampton Jockey
Club. He married Edna Louise,
second daughter of the late Edward
Dempsey, of “Wallbury.” James
Thomas Dunne, the second son of the
pioneer was bom on November 2,
1886, at Waterstown, and educated
at the Christian Brothers’ School,
Rockhampton. On terminating his
studies here he became a jackaroo on
“Banksia,” subsequently taking over
the duties of that post on “Woo-
roona,” then under the management
of his eldest brother. Later he
drew a block of land on a resump-
tion of “Portland Downs” Station,
calling the property “Killara.” He
devoted the area to sheep, holding
it until 1920, when he sold it to
Mr. J. E. Dunne, as already des-
cribed. Some time later, after the
four brothers were placed in joint
control of their father’s interests, the
three younger purchased the share
of the eldest, and Mr. J. T. Dunne
took over the duties of manager of
the firm of Dunne & Sons. The last-
mentioned gentleman has always
taken a prominent part in sport, and
is a most successful amateur rider,
having distinguished himself in var-
ious important Central Queensland
events. He takes his part in most
forms of outdoor sport, excelling in
cricket. In July, 1917, he married
Catherine Mary, the eldest daughter
of the late Edward Dempsey, and
has a family of one son, James
Arthur, and one daughter, Sheila.
Arthur Thomas, the third son of the
late J. O’Grady Dunne, and his
youngest brother, were both born at
Waterstown, one of the early homes
of the family, and educated at the
Christian Brothers’ College, Rock-
hampton. On leaving school he
entered the pastoral industry at
“Banksia.” In the year 1914 he
became a volunteer for active service
abroad with the Australian Imperial
Forces. He served in France and
Flanders, participating in the battles
of Paschendaele, Pozieres, Vimy
Ridge, and in the general offensive
on the Hindenburg Line. He was
gassed in one battle and suffered
wounds of a minor character. Finally
returning to "Wooroona,” he has
since assisted in the administration
of that station. His youngest
brother, William O’Kelly Dunne,
was born on December 22, 1897.
On the termination of his studies he
took over the duties of jackaroo on
"Wooroona,” remaining there until
1916, when he proceeded to
"Corona” Station near Longreach,
to obtain experience of sheep and
wool production. After a year there,
he joined Mr. J. E. Dunne at “Kil-
lara,” where he remained until 1920.
He then joined his brothers James
and Arthur at "Wooroona,” where
he now assists in the conduct of
affairs. He, too, takes his place
among the representative exponents
of outdoor sports and keeps up the
excellent tradition he established in
this respect during his college
career. Of the daughters of Mr.
Dunne, sen., the eldest, Lily, mar-
ried Mr. Norman Richardson, of
“Caryina” Station, in the Clermont
district; the second became the wife

of a southern pastoralist family, well
known in association with “Blink
Bonnie” Station in the Forbes dis-
trict. Mr. James Leslie’s property,
“Pine Park,” is in the same locality.
One son, Patrick David, is the issue
of the union. Mr. Dunne’s two
remaining daughters, Kathleen and
Aileen, reside with their father in
Rockhampton.
COLIN CAMPBELL MACKAY,
“Bighouse,” Morinish, via, Rock-
hampton, is the oldest living pioneer
of the Rockhampton district.
Though now well into his ninety-
third year and despite a life of hard
work, anxiety and continual sacri-
fice, lie is still hale and hearty and
possesses a keen memory for events
that are fast becoming beyond the
reach of record as the river of time
carries us swiftly onwards. Born in
Edinburgh, Scotland, on August 23,
1830, he is a son of the late Captain
Colin Mackay; a descendant of the
famous clan of the name whose
achievements form so interesting a
part of Scottish history; and one of
four brothers, Messrs. Hugh,
Patrick, James and Colin Campbell
Mackay, who played no insignificant
part in the making of the pastoral
history of Australia. The present
head of the Mackay family in Scot-
land is the twelfth Lord Reay, and
the chief family seat, “Tongue
House,” The Highlands, Scotland.
Its founder in Australia was Mr.
Hugh Mackay, the' eldest of the
brothers above mentioned, who
arrived in New South Wales in the
thirties, being later joined by Mr.
Patrick Mackay, who was asso-
ciated in pioneering enterprise with
the well-known Archer family, of
Rockhampton, when the first land
was taken up in the Burnett water-
shed, and with the party that ex-
plored the Fitzroy and laid out
“Gracemere” in 1853 as a prepara-
tory step towards the formal appli-
cation for the country. Mr. Colin
Campbell Mackay was educated at
The Grange School, near Sunder-
land, England. At the age of nine-
teen, in company with an elder
brother, Mr. James Mackay, he
embarked in the “Anglier,” a sailing
ship, for the land of the Southern
Cross, and after a voyage of feme
months duration, reached New South
Wales, the date' of his advent to the
then Colony being 1850, Within a
year of his arrival the first Austra-
lian gold discoveries eventuated, and
in 1851 he became one of the pio-
neers of the mining industry on the
Meroo goldfield, about five miles
from Bathurst. After giving min-
ing a brief trial he set out for
Queensland, where be immediate 1 } 7
became interested in sheep with the
purchase of a flock from the late
Robert Ramsay, of “Rosalie
Plains,” Darling Downs. These
sheep he overlanded to the Burnett
country, there depasturing them on
a block which he took up for the
purpose in conjunction with Mr.
Caswell and his brother Patrick, and
which yet continues to be known as
“Old Cannindah” Station. After
MR. C. C. MACKAY.
some years spent in the industry
here, he disposed of his interests in
“Old Cannindah,” and in the fifties
he settled in the Rockhampton dis-
trict, having overlanded from the
Burnett “Dalgangal” sheep for the
stocking up of the “Morinish” run.
The journey entailed many and most
severe hardships, including a short-
age of food supplies owing to a pro-
tracted period on the roads in con-
sequence of their impassable condi-
tion. Eventually it was safely
accomplished and Mr. Mackay took
up his residence on the station, where
he experienced those heartbreaking
setbacks which were generally the
lot of the men who paved the way
in the march of settlement. He
describes the now busy capital of
Central Queensland as first he saw
it more than sixty years ago from
“Gracemere” Station, as a flat of
bog and bush which on the river
edges was thickly timbered with
mangroves, a large blacks’ camp
occupying the site of the present
botanical gardens and settlement
being at the most primitive stage.
After spending much energy and
capital in improvements on “Morin -
ish,” he realized that the country
was quite unsuitable for sheep, of
which it carried between 8,000 and
9,000 in the early sixties. Depreda-
tions by the dingoes were tragically
frequent, and the spear grass proved
an unconquerable factor against wool
and mutton growing in the district.
In the hope of getting some return
for their outlay, the owners finally
put their sheep on the road for sale,
a culmination which was effected in
New South Wales, where the stock
realized prices that barely covered
the expenses of the journey. To
Mr. Mackay’s troubles were later
added financial losses due to the
failure of a. debtor to repay large
advances which he had made him,
and of another to meet his obliga-
tions for several hundreds of pounds
worth of cattle. In 1866 the aspect
of his affairs was considerably
changed by the discovery of gold on
the run, a circumstance which
shortly resulted in a good and near
market for his stock; the proclama-
tion of the Morinish township
within the boundaries of the station,
and which ere long had a popula-
tion of nearly 3,000; and the erec-
tion of a store, butcher’s shop,
hotel, dwellings and mining
machinery. Eventually he took up
and named after an old home of the
family in Scotland, “Bighouse,”
which he has held for more than
forty years. He married on Novem-
ber 14, 1874, Elizabeth Jane,
daughter of the late Matthew
Clarke, who, of English birth, was
connected with the coal trade in
London. Of the union three sons
and four daughters survive, the
former now controlling the interests
of the family which still has its
headquarters at the old “Bighouse”
homestead, where the pioneer and
his good wife have around them the
associations of nearly half a century
of years.


JAMES EDGAR, J.P., “Craigie-
lee” Station, Morinish, via Rock-
hampton, was born in the year 1850
at “Mossband Craigs,” Dumfries-
shire, Scotland. When a lad in his
teens he made the voyage from the
Old World to Queensland under the
guardianship of the late R. Kidd,
who died two years after their arrival
in the country. Travelling by the
“Bayswater,” he landed at Rock-
hampton on May 24, 1864, and his
first experience in the industry to
which he was destined to devote his
life was gained shortly afterwards at
“Glenroy,” a sheep and cattle station
then owned by Messrs. McKenzie and
Muldoon. On leaving “Glenroy.”
he accepted a position on “Morin-
ish” Station, under Mr. C. C.
Mackay, one of the most highly es-
teemed pioneers of Central Queens-
land, being employed as a general
stock hand on this property for two
years, and at the end of that period
taking over the duties of sheep over-
seer of the station. During his con-
nection with “Morinish,” several
goldfields were discovered in the
locality, and he had many opportuni-
ties of gaining first-hand experience
of life in the mining camps at the
Ridgelands, Morinish, Blackfellows
Gully and Rosewood diggings. The
blacks were a menace in those times,
a particular friend of Mr. Edgar s
having been murdered by them on
the banks of the Fitzroy River, near
Lake Learmouth. The subject of
this sketch held the position of over-
seer at “Morinish” until the removal
of the flock owing to the prevalence
of spear grass and the consequent im-
possibility of stocking sheep with
profit. “Morinish’ was the last
station in the Rockhampton district
to eliminate woollies, its flock being
sold to Mr. H. Corry and transferred
to the Thomson River watershed.
Mr. Edgar carried out the under-
taking, having started from “Mori-
nish” with 10,000 head, halted an
route at “Arcturus Downs,” and
finally delivered his charges at
“Tocal,” near Arrilalah, in the dis-
trict outlying Longreach. “Arcturus
Downs” was then under the adminis-
tration of Mr. Alick Laurie, and the
kindnesses which he experienced from
this gentleman and Ids wife stand
out prominently among the incidents
of his long droving trip and are now
among his happiest memories.
Shortly after he reached “Tocal”
1,100 cattle arrived on that station
o 2
from “Cecil Plains,” and it was
therefore decided to move the sheep
to “Lousia Downs,” on the Bar coo.
This was in 1871, and Mr. Edgar re-
mained in charge of the stock until
the Barcoo property was sold by Mr.
Corry to Mr. Walter Douglas. He
next accepted a good offer from the
Wienholt Bros., then owners of
“Malvern Hills,” “Fassifern,”
“Maryvale” and other stations, this
firm desiring his services as a
drover. His association with the
Messrs. Wienholt lasted until 1877,
when he returned to the coastal dis-
trict and embarked on a venture on
his own account, taking up country
on the “Morinisli” resumption under
the Conditional Purchase Act. To
the original area, which he desig-
nated “Craigielee,” he added by
later acquirement under the Dutton
Grazing Farm Act. On securing his
first block he purchased 500 head of
cattle at £5 per head, and immedi-
ately applied his best efforts to the
further development of his resources.
Unfortunately, his enterprise' was
overtaken by a period of drought,
the 1877 drought being very severe,
and at the end of his first year his
herd was reduced to 250 head. This
experience was the first of many
adversities as a pastoral landowner,
but Mr. Edgar, by hard work and
sacrifice, surmounted one difficulty
after another, and now from well-
earned retirement looks back upon
half a ( century in the industry—a
lifetime marked by frequent
droughts, stock epidemics, low
prices, long hours of hard work and
exposure, and privations too numer-
ous to mention. None the less, his
heart still inclines to the free, open
environment and the untrammelled
conditions of the bush. In 1910, he
purchased the “Columba” pastoral
lease with stock, and four years later
bought unstocked, “Jellinbah” and
“Mannetta” holdings. Tire two
latter he depastured and sold to the
Queensland Meat Export Co.; and
in 1917 and 1921, purchased, respec-
tively, “Mount Fairview” and “May
Downs.” During his pastoral career
he has witnessed widely divergent
values of stock, prices which he has
received for similar bullocks ranging
from 30s. to £l4 per head. Mr.
Edgar married in the year 1876
Mary Jane, third daughter of Mr. J.
Mylrea of “Lake Learmouth” Sta-

JOHN HENRY SALMON, J.P.,
“Apple Vale,” Morinish, was born
on September 20, 1872, at Ridge-
lands, near Rockhampton, and is a
son of Mr. John Salmon, a native
of County Clare, who settled in
Australia from Ireland in the year
1864. The late gentleman was
accompanied from the Old World by
his wife, a member of a Limerick
family; and this lady shared the
many vicissitudes of bis Australian
career, after his death carrying on
the work which he had put in hand
and typifying throughout her long
life all that is best in the spheres
of wifehood and motherhood. Mr.
John Salmon settled with his family
in the vicinity of Ridgelands about
the year 1870, taking up “Apple
Vale.” Here he engaged chiefly in
dairying, varying his interests with
mining ventures at Ridgelands and
Morinish when thos? fields were in
the heyday of prosperity. Brought
up at “Apple Vale,” within ken of
the young goldfield, his small sons
learnt much of life in the rough
school of experience which the dig-
gings afforded and in which all types
of humanity were strangely repre-
sented. They attended a school in
Morinish that was conducted by a
Mr. Wooley, who, typical of a class,
had received the highest advantages
in the way of education which the
Old World afforded, and finally
coming to Australia, had drifted to
the goldfield in the hope of better
fortune than his scholastic attain-
ments had brought him. This gen-
tleman was entitled to the letters
LL.D. after his name, and, out of
school hours, the subject of our
memoir often heard him debating
questions of overseas politics with a
Trinity College man, who worked as
a fencer on his father’s property,
“Apple Vale.” Mr. Salmon later
attended at Rockhampton a private
school conducted by the Rev. Father
Moccam, from which he became a
student at the Catholic School in


William Street. When still in his
teens he settled permanently to life
on the land, his duties at “Apple
Yale” being varied, especially after
a shower of rain, by explorations

around the old workings in the
gullies of Morinish for the coveted
“gleam.” As he grew nearer man-
hood, mining and prospecting of a
more arduous nature occupied him
in intervals of work on the home
property, which, when the prosper-
ity of the township as a gold-bear-
ing centre had waned, claimed all
his attention, the herd having by
then considerably increased. At
“Apple Yale,” dairy, pig and
poultry farming was carried on and
in addition, grazing on a small scale,
as bullocks at that time were fetch-
ing good prices and fattened well on
the rich country on the banks of the
Fitzroy River. On the death of
their father in 1898, Messrs. John
Henry and Patrick Salmon carried
on in conjunction with their mother,
who had the satisfaction of seeing
the hard work of her boys and her
own efforts for their welfare meeting
with well-deserved success, which
was furthered in 1902 by the estab-
lishment of a creamery in Rock-
hampton that provided a steady
market for their dairying products.
As their circumstances continued to
improve the brothers purchased
much of the old “Morinish” free-
hold, which was originally taken up
by Mr. Colin Campbell Mackay,
whose first camp, at a site known as
the Washpool, was included in the
Salmon’s purchases at that time.
The country surrounding the Wash-
pool was named by the new owners,
“Normanville” and is comprised of
particularly rich country made up of
river flats that are wonderfully pro-
lific. “Normanville,” “Apple Vale”
and the various selections taken up
brought the acreage of the family’s
possessions to 30,000. A house was
erected on “Normanville” where
Mr. Patrick Salmon made his head-
quarters, residing there until the
time of his death which occurred on
August 9, 1921, since when Mr.
John H. Salmon has administered
his estate. Mr, Patrick Salmon is
survived by his widow who is a
daughter of Mr. John Mylrea, of
“Wattle Bank” Station. Despite

the pressure of private affairs, Mr.
Salmon, of “Apple Vale,” has for
many years past identified himself
with various public movements hav-
ing for their object the advance-
ment of the district in which his
interests are centred and of which he
may well be described as one of the
most prominently ' public-spirited
citizens. From the year 1905, when
he was first elected to the Fitzroy
Shire Council, he has given his best
efforts in the interests of the rate-
payers, acting as chairman for three
terms (1905, 1909 and 1915) under
the old franchise, and under the new
system of general voting put in force
in 1921, in the same capacity, receiv-
ing election by a three to one
majority. Chief among the public
works which his efforts were largely
instrumental in securing is the
Alton Downs railway line, that has
given the district its greatest im-
petus in the way of settlement and
development. He fought for this
line in the face of intense opposition,
and when, finally, the ratepayers
were asked to decide the matter, the
scheme was outvoted by a majority
of one. However, his representa-
tions as to its utility had convinced
the Government, and it was decided
to build the line on a guarantee
basis, the work being actually put in
hand on October 25, 1915, though
for one cause or another it was
delayed, eventually being onened by
the then Minister for Railways,
Mr. John Adamson, who was
assisted by Mr. John Salmon in his
capacity as chairman of the Fitzroy
Shire Council and prime mover in
the undertaking. Since the opening
of this line practically 50,000 acres
have been settled by fifty families,
and the prosperity of the whole dis-
trict assured by the facilities of
transport not only for ordinary
agricultural products but for cotton,
the culture of which has made such
enormous strides recently, bringing
fresh blood and capital to the
locality. Other bodies which pro-
vide a medium for the activities of
Mr. Salmon include the Rockhamp-

whose career in his adopted country
was marked by pastoral enterprise
on a scale of which some idea may be
gathered by a perusal of the follow-
ing pages. A son of the tenant
farmer who rented Holyburton
Farm near Greenlaw, Berwickshire,
the last-named gentleman was a
native of that district. He estab-
lished his name and line in Australia
in the very early days of settlement
in Victoria, becoming a pioneer of
the Western district of the Sister
State, prominent amongst the pas-
toralists of New South Wales (as
•the owner of “Eli Elwah” and “Till-
til” Stations in the vicinity of Hay
and Balranold respectively), and
one of the most, progressive and en-
terprising of the landholders of
Queensland during the first decades
of its existence as an independent
Colony. His sons became well
known in different fields of activity,
the eldest being Senator George
Fairbairn, a native of Geelong, Vic-
toria, a past student of the Geelong
Grammar School and a Cambridge
man. Senator Fairbairn completed
his University career in the year

1876, when he returned to Australia
and associated himself with the pas-
toral investments which then com-
prised the chief interests of the
family. Subsequently, he became
largely interested in the frozen meat
industry, of which phase of pastoral
enterprise his father was one of the
inaugurators in Australia. In com-
mercial life his activities covered a
wide sphere and included a
directorship of the boards of the
Union Bank of Australia, Lim-
ited, Dalgety & Company Limited,
and the Fairbairn Pastoral
Company. He entered the political
arena in 1903, when he was elected
to the Victorian Legislative Assem-
bly as member for Toorak. Since
then he has continued to be promi-
nently associated with the Parlia-
mentary life of Victoria, retaining
the Toorak seat until 1906, when he
entered the House of Representatives
as member for Fawkner; becoming
a member of the Senate in 1907.
Among the bodies with which he has
been prominently associated is the
Employers’ Federation, of which he
was appointed President in 1904.

was honoured by being chosen as one
of the eight in the 1878 boat-race
against Oxford. For many years,
his career was bound up with the
pastoral progress of Queensland as
one of the heirs to his father’s pro-
perties here, the administration of
which he actively supervised until
1906, when he retired to the South.
He married a daughter of Mr.
Osborne, a well-known pastoralist.
Of his sons, the eldest, Mr. Charles
Osborne Fairbairn, was born in Mel-
bourne on May 2, 1893, and edu-
cated at the Geelong Grammar
School and Jesus College, Cam-
bridge, being still in the Motherland
in 1914 when war was declared be-
tween England and Germany. That
tremendous event cancelled for the
time being existing arrangements
for his future, for, volunteering for
service abroad, he was shortly
attached to the Loyal North Lanca-
shire Regiment. Later, he became a
member of the Royal Air Force,
attaining the rank of Major in that
service, and becoming a casualty
while fighting over the Ypres Front.
On the conclusion of hostilities he
returned to Australia and settled
at “Banongill,” near Skip ton, Vic-
toria, a property which has been
held in the Fairbairn family for
nearly a quarter of a century. Mr.
JAMES VALENTINE FAIR-
BAIRN also received his education
at the Geelong Grammar School,
where he remained until he reached
the age of eighteen. On the comple-
tion of his school career in Australia,
he proceeded to England, where, in
1916, ho joined the Royal Flying
Corps, serving as a member of the
54th Squadron. After operating for
some months in the fighting zone,
lie had his arm shattered in an en-
gagement over St. Quentin, and, his
disabled machine descending into
enemy country, he was taken pri-
soner and detained in Germany for
fourteen months, being eventually
transferred to Holland, where he
was permitted to remain on parole
until August, 1918. His return to
England was effected under the
arrangement by which completely in-
capacitated German prisoners in
England were exchanged for the sol-
diers and officers detained by the
enemy. After the declaration of the
Armistice he returned to Australia,
though the nature of his wound very
shortly necessitated his again visit-
ing Great Britain for surgical treat-
ment. Mr. J. V. Fairbairn, who
married a daughter of Mr. Charles
Forrester, of Melbourne, lives at

“Magenta.” Charles George Patrick
Fairbairn, the youngest son of Mr.
C. Fairbairn, was bom at “Banon-
gill,” Victoria, in September, 1908,
and, at time of writing, is a student
of the Geelong Grammar School, the
college which has been the Alma
Mater of various members, of two
geneiations of his family. The name
of the Fairbairn family has been
associated in ownership with the his-
torical Central Queensland station
known as “Peak Downs” since the
year 1869, when its founder, the
late George Fairbairn, purchased the
property from Messrs. Ronald and
Burnett, and placed Mr. Rawdon
Green (now also deceased) in charge.
Though his other interests prevented
the continual presence of the pioneer
on the station, he supervised its
administration and frequently
visited it. In the early seventies,
Mr. Green was succeeded in the man-
agement of “Peak Downs” by the
late John Turnbull, who subse-
quently owned a pastoral property
m Western Queensland; and later,
Mr. Charles Fairbairn became
actively engaged in its management.
The run, consisting of about 150,000
acres, of which 80,000 comprise free-
hold land, was originally depastured
by the pioneer Fairbairn with a
comparatively small flock of sheep

This being before the time of fences
in the Central-west, shepherds were
employed to guard the flock from the
depredations of aborigines and
native dogs. Naturally, the system
proved often inadequate, even over
country of comparatively small
dimensions, and did not allow of
holdings being stocked to one-half
their present carrying capacity. In
the late seventies most of the pas-
toralists of the district outlying
'Clermont received a severe setback,
and many were ruined, owing to an
abnormal increase of wallabies, these

the year 1895, ended a career almost

operations which it covered, and the
part it played in the making of the
country’s nationhood. In the year
1896, these brothers floated the pro-
perties now comprising their inter-
ests into company concerns and regis-
tered the joint ownership under the
title of the Fairbairn Pastoral Com-
pany, personally retaining the
majority of the shares. Tiie Queens-

rendered the land bare of grass. Mr.
George Fairbairn saved most of his
stock, however, by transferring them
to “Landsdowne” Station, which he
purchased at this time and immedi-
ately submitted to a vigorous system
of development that very shortly re-
sulted in the tenfold increase of the
carrying capacity of the run, which,
on coming into his hands, provided
safe pasturage for only 20,000
woollies, but three years later, was
stocked witli a flock of 200,000. This
example of his enterprise and pro-
gressiveness was repeated in other
transactions of the seventies and
eighties which included the
only a fifth of which at time of pur-
chase, approached the stage of
development to which his efforts
rapidly brought it ; and that in the
nineties, over 800,000 sheep were put
to the shears on the properties owned
by the Fairbairn family. The per-
sonnel of the firm which he founded
so many years ago has undergone
some changes, though his name,
borne by his descendants of two
generations, yet continues to desig-
nate its principals. His sons,
Messrs. George and Charles Fair-
bairn, who were admitted into part-
nership with him when they arrived
at manhood, continued to jointly
“Bimerah,” “Peak Downs” and
“Wolfang,” which, shortly after the
formation of the Company, were
placed under the general manager-
ship of Mr. Maclean, the present
owner of “Langton” Station. Mr.
Maclean retained the position for
over twenty years, making hie head-
quarters at “Magenta,” the home-
stead erected by Mr. Charles Fair-
baim for his use on the block so
named, which is included in the
area of “Peak Downs” Station. The
reputation for excellence so well
deserved by the big-framed, well-
formed woollies of “Peak Downs” is
widespread, and is a result of the


extreme care used from the seventies
onwards in the selection of breeders
for the flocks, the sires for this and
other properties in which the family
are interested being bred in the stud
which forms one of the chief sections
of the industry on “Peak Downs.”
Founded in the seventies, under the
direction of Mr. George Fairbairn,
jun., on the highest quality Tasma-
nian merinos procured from the
Messrs. Gibson, who were among the
expert sheep men of their time, this
stud has continued to receive the
utmost care in handling, only rams
of proven quality being introduced
and foreign blood absolutely ex-
cluded. The strength of the present
flock is 60,000, and the wool grown
on “Peak Downs” has, for a decade
past, continued to top the Queens-
land markets in open competition.
“Peak Downs” depastures, also, a
fine type of cattle, the herd usually
averaging about 1,000 head ; and a
very important department of the
operations controlled here is a stud
herd of shorthorns which was also
started in the seventies from
breeders raised at different well-
known studs, including that of the
Messrs. Archer Brothers at “Grace-
mere.” One of the earliest sires was
purchased from Messrs. Robertson
Brothers for the sum of 1,000
guineas. Animals, equal in respect
to pedigree and quality to the
original bulls, have since been regu-
larly introduced, among the later
comers being sires raised in the studs
of the Hon. William McCulloch, and
in the Angas (S.A.), the Dugdale,
and other studs of equal standing,
their progeny, bred at “Peak
Downs,” having left their stamp to
a. very marked extent on the herds of
Central Northern Queensland, thus
adding materially to the improve-
ment of the cattle industry in this
part of the State. Few stations in
the North are more favourably
known among horse-lovers than
“Peak Downs,” and it may be safely
said that, than the horses bred here,
none better have ever carried silk
among grass-eaters —a fact that has
been very frequently demonstrated
at the many amateur meetings at
which they have more than held
their own. The highest proof of
their quality, however, is contained
in the fact that “Peak Downs” sup-
plies a continuous demand in the
horse markets of the world among
buyers who are thoroughly conversant
with tlie points by which equine
stock should lie judged, and demand
and secure the best. The run usu-
ally carries a mob approximating
300 head. “Blondin” was the ear-
liest “Peak Downs” sire and left his
stamp on a large percentage of the
stock bred in the district at the
period, gaining for the station its
first degree of prestige as a horse-
breeding centre. Later, “Glenden-
non” came and proved his worth by
the class of his progeny. Other
notable sires there were, until,
finally, “Gay Bob” by “Bobdil” was
secured, this stallion being now the
reigning sire. The original “Peak
Downs” homestead is used by the
manager, Mr. M. F. Crombie, who
has a share in the station, and a
very fine residence called “Magenta,
from a block of country providing
its site, within the area and a creek
in its vicinity, serves as the home
of Mr. J. V. Fairbairn. The opera-
tions which have radiated from the
enterprise of the late pioneer, George
Fairbairn, afford, by their vastness
and far-reaching influence on the
industrial progress of the Continent,
a striking example of what the coun-
try owes to him and men of his
calibre, and lead us to realize how
much this and future generations
have to be grateful for to those who,
adventuring forth from an older
civilization, challenged Fortune with
a courage that only the knowledge
of their own ability to work and fight
could evolve.

RICHARD NEAGLE, J.P.,
“Gaylong,” Capella, was born in
the parish of Killusty, County Tip-
perary, Ireland, on September 9,
1860, and is a son of the late Patrick
Neagle, who was a Tipperary farmer
and a member of a family which had
been identified for generations with
primary production in Ireland,
chiefly in those parts of the County
outlying the town of Feathard. The
owner of “Gaylong'' had a National
School education, on the conclusion
of which he decided to carve a career
abroad, choosing, as a consequence of
the fact that certain of his relatives
were settled in pastoral and commer-
cial pursuits in New South Wales,
the far-distant land under the
Southern Cross as the scene of his
future life. He left Ireland in the
year 1880, and in due course reached
“Ballyryan” Station, his first home
in the land of his adoption, and
then owned by the late Hon. John
Neagle Ryan, under whom he
gained his first knowledge of
the stock industry as carried on
in Australia. Four years after his
advent to “Ballyryan” he, exercis-
ing his own initiative, journeyed
north with the object of seeing
something more of the resources of
this vast island and obtaining work

materialize his intention he pur-

which he eventually severed his con-
nection in order to go on the land,
being enabled to make a start in
the pastoral industry with capital
he had recently received as a
family bequest. Before making a
final choice he inspected a good deal
of country in Western Queensland,
eventually taking up the block, then
newly thrown open for selection, on
which he now resides. “Gaylong”
was originally a portion of the his-
toric “Peak Downs” run, and his
ownership of the property dates
from the year 1892. Though of
comparatively small acreage it has a
very fine carrying capacity, usually
depasturing a flock varying in
strength from 7,000 to 10,000, and
in addition a small herd of cattle
and some horses. “Huntley” ewes
formed the nucleus of the flock,
which, during the years following its
foundation, has been kept up to the
desired standard by the periodical
introduction of “Peak Downs” rams.
The run is amply watered by wells
to which are attached windmills and
troughing; the other improvements,
including outbuildings, etc., being

the Commonwealth he also took a
leading part in affairs, and during
the reign of the second Charles was
imprisoned as one likely to prove
mischievous to the Royal cause, his
death having occurred as the result
of an illness contracted during his
detention. The family seat of the
Hutchinsons, which was sold by the
widow of Colonel Hutchinson, and at
a subsequent period pulled down,
was “Owthorpe,” in the village of
Owthorpe, Nottinghamshire. Many
old valuables which it contained,
such as china, furniture, and oil
paintings, are still held by descend-
ants of the family which, on the
maternal side, was closely allied dur-
ing the 17th century with the Apsley
family, Colonel Hutchinson having
married Lucy, daughter of Sir Allen
Apsley, who was son of Sir Allen
Apsley, Lieutenant of the Tower to
James and Charles 1., which, accord-
ing to' the memoirs already quoted,
eventually merged into the noble
family of Bathurst who have adopted
the name Apsley as their second title.
The Hutchinsons were also related to
the Stanhopes (through the marriage
of Sir Thomas, father of Colonel
Hutchinson, with Catherine, his first
wife, daughter of Sir John Stanhope,
of Elvaston, and sister of Philip, Earl
of Chesterfield) and other well-known
English families. Among the more
recent ancestors of the gentleman
under review, one is recorded as hav-
ing been a banker and silversmith
at Newark, not far from Owthorpe,
and others as engaged in various
professions, his grandfather hav-
ing followed the practice of medicine
in Nottinghamshire. His father, the
late Dr. Benjamin Clay, resigned his
appointment on the “Red Jacket”
shortly after his arrival in Australia,
and, attracted by the impelling fas-
cination of the gold diggings, at once
proceeded to the Bendigo field. From
Bendigo he went to other gold-
bearing centres then in their infancy
and later participated in the various
rushes which occurred within a short
period of his arrival. After giving
the mining industry a fair trial
without gaining tangible results he
decided to enter the pastoral in-
dustry, and in due course took up,
in partnership with the late Major
Burrowes, virgin country in Southern
Queensland, near the New South
Wales border. The property owned
by Dr. Hutchinson and Major Bur-
rowes will be remembered by the
pioneers still living in that district
and their children as “Ross-
way” Station, though its name was
afterwards changed to “Ardoch.”
Here for some years the founder of
the Hutchinson family in Australia
contended with the many hardships,
obstacles, and setbacks incidental to
pioneering life at the period, in spite
of which he continued to hold the
property until he saw his prospects
in the industry utterly ruined by the
eventuation of a severe drought after
a period of depression in which stock
fetched exceedingly low prices and
in many oases were unsaleable. Rea-
lizing the impossibility of recon-
structing his fortunes as a pastoralist
he removed to Victoria, where, at
Beechworth, he once more entered
upon the practice of medicine. Sub-
sequently he established himself at
Wangaratta, and became the first
Medical Superintendent of the
General Hospital there. In the
course of his professional career in
Victoria he again disastrously in-
vested in land, losing such capital
as he had acquired with the bursting
of what is now spoken of as the Great
Land Boom, which, in a quickly
following period of depression, spelt
financial ruin for so many. The late
pioneer, despite the misfortunes which
attended his enterprise, nevertheless
played no mean part in the history
making of the country through his
efforts in developing the industry to
which both his sons have devoted
themselves. He married Jane, daugh-
ter of the late John Farrell, who, of
Celtic birth, was also one of the early
MR. R. C. HUTCHINSON.
pioneers of the Continent. Of the
union there are two sons, of whom
the younger, Benjamin Tunes Hutch-
inson, is engaged in pastoral pursuits
near Wagga Wagga. Mr. Richard


Charles Hutchinson, of “Diamond
Downs,” was educated at the Mel-
bourne Grammar School, where he
continued to study until reaching
the age of seventeen, when he was
sent to the Dookie Agricultural
College. Here he remained for two
years, on the conclusion of his course
proceeding to Queensland to enter
the pastoral industry as a jackaroo
at “Wolfang” Station, which was
then under the management of Mr.
Harry Coldham. Within two years
of his advent to “Wolfang” he was
appointed to the overssership of this
well-known old pastoral holding —a
post which he continued to occupy
until the outbreak of the South
African War, when patriotism de-
manded that he should join the
colours. He accordingly volunteered
for service, and being accepted for
the front left Australia as a member
of the 4th Queensland Imperial
Bushmen’s Corps. In the course of
his military career he served with
distinction in a number of engage-
ments, participating in the cam-
paigns conducted in the Orange Free
State, the Transvaal, and Cape
Colony, and winning mention in
despatches. For his services he was
decorated with the South African
Medal with four bars. On his
return to Australia he again inter-
ested himself in pastoral pursuits as
overseer of “La Plata,” a station
near Blackall, and was engaged with
the duties incidental to his position
until 1902, when the drought which
devastated the country at this stage
of her history was at its height. The
drought was responsible for his
employment in charge of a flock of
sheep despatched from “North-
ampton Downs” for sustenance on
the roads. He was very successful
in handling the travelling stock, of
which a large percentage would un-
doubtedly have fallen victims to the
abnormal conditions then existing
under less careful supervision. Sub-
sequently he was offered and accepted
the overseership of “Northampton
Downs,” which he continued to hold
for nearly three years. In 1907 he
became manager of “Langton,” near
Capella, on behalf of Mr. A. D.
Menzies, and continued to control
affairs on this station on account of
Mr. Menzies, Mr. Charles Fair-
bairn, and Mr. Maclean, suc-
cessively, until 1921, when he severed
his fourteen years’ connection there-
with, tlie last-mentioned gentleman
then entering personally upon its
administration. On leaving “Lang-
ton” lie entered upon the manage-
ment of “Diamond Downs,” and at
time of writing is occupied with the
MR. T. HATFIELD.
administration of this run. During
his long managerial career he has
acquired stock and grazing interests
on his own account, these lying in
the Peak Downs district, and includ-
ing a block of cattle country near
Clermont. Mr. Hutchinson was
created a Justice of the Peace under
the Kidston Administration. From
his earliest advent to the district he
has uniformly displayed those quali-
ties of public spiritedness that make

for good citizenship, and at time of
writing is chairman of the Belyando
Shire Council, of which he has been
a member for fourteen years. He is
also chairman of the Clermont Mar-
supial Board, and takes his part in
any movement likely to advance the
interests of the district or com-
munity. A lover of all clean sport,
his recreation is chiefly taken on the
cricket field—on which he has pro-
minently represented Central Queens-
land—and the turf. He is a com-
mitteeman of nearly all the Central
Queensland racing bodies, and as a
rider in amateur events has won con-
siderable success, both with his own
and friends’ mounts. In the year
1908 he married Catherine Elinor,
daughter of the late Thomas Hat-
field, who, of old Yorkshire descent
and a native of Liverpool, New
South Wales, was well known during
his lifetime as the owner of “Fleurs”
Station, near Clermont, and as one
of the oldest pioneers of that dis-
trict. Of the union there is a family
of three sons and one daughter. Mr.
Hutchinson is a member of the Rock-
hampton and Clermont Clubs.
WILLIAM NAUGHTON, of
Emerald, is the son of the late John
Naughton, of Geelong, Victoria, and
was born on November 22, 1862, at
Murphy’s Creek, Tarnagulla, Vic-
toria. The late John Naughton came
from County Limerick, Ireland, and
arrived in Victoria in the early
fifties. He was that type of adven-
turous, level-headed Irishman who
have ever been amongst the most
efficient builders of industry and
pillars in the economic development
of the Commonwealth. In his
native land he had been associated
with the farming industry, and on
arrival in the country of his adoption
immediately turned his attention to
the dairying industry. In 1856 he
was engaged in this business in the
vicinity of Ballarat, where he had
settled with his wife whom he had
married after his arrival in Aus-
tralia. Mrs. Naughton is a native
of the Emerald Isle, her birthplace
being County Galway, and she was
brought to Victoria by her parents
in the seventh year of her age. The
intense interest which always accom-
panies gold mining with all its
elusive promise of fortune was at
that time bringing all classes of men
under its seductive influence, and
the late John Naughton was no
exception to the rule. He invested
his money in the Red Jacket Mine,
and also in another of the long-
forgotten mining ventures of those
days. These did not fulfil their
golden promise, and Mr. Naughton’s
investments ended in failure. It


seems the irony of fate that the Red
Jacket Mine, abandoned by the
syndicate of which Mr. Naugbton
was a shareholder, afterwards yielded
rich rewards to another syndicate
which at a later date delved further
into the unexplored depths. About
this time, owing to his ignorance of
the new conditions governing the
holding of land, Mr. Naughon sud-
denly discovered that he had been
crowded out of the land upon which
his cattle were grazing. This, in
conjunction with his loss of capital
in mining, decided him to seek a
new field for dairying operations,
and in 1858 he migrated to Climes,
situated some 30 odd miles in a
northerly direction from Ballarat
City, Victoria, the journey being
accomplished in a bullock waggon,
in which the family was accom-
modated, together with their goods
and chattels. Here he leased a block
of land from the late Sir William
Campbell, and for two years carried
on the business of dairy-farming. In
1860, having leased “Willan,” a
farm at Murphy Creek, he trans-
ferred his stock and home to the new
locality, which has since become
known as “Naugbton Flat,” and it
was here that his son William, the
subject of our review, first saw the
light. Could these worthy parents
have foreseen the great influence
their children would wield in pro-
moting the development of the
primary industries of the country of
their adoption, it would, perhaps,
have in some measure repaid them
for their earlier struggles and dis-
appointments while fighting the
crude conditions of the pioneering
days. In the latter part of 1862
the late Mr. Naughton left Murphy
Creek and took up land under an
Act introduced by Mr. Charles
Gavan Duffy (after Sir Charles),
Minister of Lands, and placed on
the Statute Book by the Parliament
of Victoria. Mr. Naughton secured
400 acres under the provisions of the
Act, and also purchased other blocks
from the late Hugh Glass, of East
Loddon, bringing his total holdings
up to 640 acres, all of which was
eminently suited to dairy-farming.
Despite all these advantages the
settler did not march blithely along
the road to success without suffering
the troubles and setbacks of drought
and disease encountered by pioneers
in common with the people of to-day
who are engaged in the primary
industries in Australia. In 1863 the
scourge of pleuro-pneumonia decim-
ated his dairy herd, and the
drought which followed and con-
tinued into the year 1865 before it
broke, was responsible for further
heavy stock losses. A portion of the
herd was saved by moving them to
a neighbouring run some 20 miles
distant. Mr. Naughton endeavoured
to ameliorate the desperate conditions
by sinking wells, but the water
proved too salty to be of much value.
During the drought his wife remained
at Butcher Lagoon, situated on the
Loddon River, a locality which
subsequently became known as
“Naughton Swamp.” During this
period of stress foodstuffs were
necessarily very limited, tea, sugar,
and flour being the only articles of
diet, meat being unobtainable. The
blacks, then in a wild state, occa-
sionally bartered a few fish for
various articles, and these formed a
welcome addition to a very attenu-
ated food supply. The drought
brought financial disaster to the pas-
toral industry, amongst the sufferers
being the late Hugh Glass, pre-
viously mentioned in this article.
The banks contributed to the finan-
cial debacle by forcing owners to
sacrifice the remnants of the flocks
and herds, together with the proper-
ties, at a time when people feared
to buy. Mr. William Naughton
recollects instances of wethers being
sold at 2s. per head, which, when
the drought broke six months later,
realized 16s. per head. In order to
obtain facilities for the education of
his children, the late Mr. Naughton
selected 640 acres of land at Bald
Hills, Woodstock, near Bendigo, and
the members of his family attended
the State School there. He continued
to follow the business of a dairyman,
but the land was unsuitable for the
purpose, being much too poor in
quality. Stock were cheap at that
time (1869), and during the winter
months butter was bringing good
prices, but in the spring and summer
months the returns were so small
as to be altogether unprofitable.
Then it was that Mr. Naughton and
his family turned their energies to
cheese-making, this nourishing article
of diet selling at an average price
of 7id. per lb., and proving much
more profitable than butter-making.
The Naughton family excelled in
cheese-making, and Mr. William
Naughton recalls with natural pride
the fact that on only one occasion
did they fail to carry off the prize
in the many exhibitions in which
they competed. The work was all
done by the family, very little out-
side labour being employed. The
business was carried on till December,
1876, in which month the late Mrs.
Naughton, mother of Mr. William
Naughton, passed away, and this
even led to the severing of old
family ties, the older members pro-
ceeding to Northern Victoria, where
they settled on the land. Their
departure crippled the industry, as
the younger members were unable
to continue the production of butter
and cheese owing to the shortage of
labour and, to some extent, to a lack
of the technical knowledge possessed
by the older members who had
departed. Accordingly they devoted
their attention to the production of
milk, which was sold to the local
factory at prices varying from 3d. to
6d. per gallon, according to the
fluctuations of cheese values. The
lower value of 3d. resulted in loss,
as the cost of production was from
4d. to 4|d. per gallon. About this
time, in 1877, they became interested
in selections in the Loddon district,
which they stocked with a small
number of sheep, shepherding the
animals on these areas till fencing
had been erected. About the year
1882 the late John Naughton gave
his son William a start in the world,
and joining his brother, Mr. E.
Naughton, the firm of E. & W.
Naughton was founded. The partners
commenced dairying operations on a
small scale, and also dealt in stock,
selling for cash and on bills. Thus
at the age of 21 years Mr. W.
Naughton launched out upon a
career which, in addition to being
profitable to himself, has {moved of
material benefit in every State of the
Commonwealth. The clear business
brain sought an outlet for its
dynamic energy in big conceptions.
As the years advanced, his know-
ledge of the primary industry of
farming, embracing produce, grazing
lands and stock and its attendant
conditions in every part of Australia,
became consummate and profound.
The initial stages of the career of
William Naughton were based on
foresight, persistent effort, and in-
tegrity. The year 1882 saw him
interested in his first selection in the
Loddon district, Victoria. His father
had also passed over to him a block
of 640 acres, for which he was to
pay £2,000 in instalments spread
over a period of years. This wise
arrangement inculcated a sense of
responsibility and the necessity for
thrift. From that date he and his
brother, Mr. E. Naughton, practic-
ally became dealers in stock, Mr.
William Naughton buying large


drafts of stock at Wodonga, Echuca,
and elsewhere, later selling the
cattle in lots to suit the requirements
of buyers. While carrying out
these transactions he laid the
foundations of the brilliant financial
genius which has since enabled him
to successfully grapple with the
difficult problems involved in his
vast dealings in stock and station
properties throughout the whole of
Australia. He possessed in a marked
degree that delicate and intricate
genius for high finance, and his
grasp of geographical, climatic, and
other problems involved in dealing
with the varied conditions which
beset the man who enters upon the
development and realization of the
resources of this vast Continent was
so practical and comprehensive that
he has not only achieved success for
himself, but has been instrumental
in helping others to realize and
develop the resources of the country
in which their lot has been cast, to
the general benefit of the community.
Mr. Naughton has had to fight many
adverse circumstances along the line
of progress. The great financial
disasters of 1893 which so seriously
affected the whole of Australia
involved his firm in very substantial
losses. E. & W. Naughton were
then dealing very largely in stock,
using their properties on the Loddon
as trading depots. The bulk of their
funds were in bills which had been
discounted by the banks, and most
of these, being dishonoured by the
drawers as they fell due, the firm
was forced to sacrifice their stock on
a panic-stricken market in order to
meet the obligations imposed on
them by the dishonoured notes of
their clients. The year 1901 again
saw the brothers grappling with
drought, conditions which periodic-
ally lay their arid scourge across the
fe/tile face of shrinking earth, and
were compelled to sell a large num-
ber of their sheep, as no relief
country was obtainable upon any-
thing like reasonable terms. Some
they shipped to Tasmania, but the
only market there was for crossbreds.
A number of animals were sold to
Fellow & Hogan, who shipped them
to South Africa. The big drought
of 1902-3 played havoc with their
stock, entailing a monetary loss of
over £lO,OOO. These setbacks only
served to spur the brothers to still
greater efforts and to further
emphasise the wonderful knowledge
of conditions and the faculty of
finance possessed by both members
of the firm, who launched out on a
campaign of stock and station deal-
ing which with the passage of time
became so comprehensive in character
as to embrace every State in the
Island Continent. They had disposed
of their properties on the Loddon in
the nineties, and had secured land
on the Murray River, also properties
known as “Coondrook” and “War-
koo,” in the Deniliquin district,
New South Wales, and grazing
blocks on the Lachlan River. These
holdings formed their trading depots
and became the nucleus of their
business enterprise which, as time
went on, thrust its ramifications and
influence in ever-widening circles
throughout the length and breadth
of Australia. In 1903 they bought
their first station in Queensland.
This was “Eastmere,” near Jericho,
Central Queensland, a run embracing
40 square miles of country, lightly
stocked with 600 head of cattle, the
remnant of a splendid herd which
had been practically wiped out by
one of the most severe droughts ever
experienced in Queensland. This
property passed into other hands by
purchase in 1906, the Messrs.
Naughton securing “Murrimgle”
Station, with an area of 150,000
acres, and situated on the Lachlan
River, New South Wales, from Mr.
W. Tyson, a nephew of the late
Hon. James Tyson, famous for his
meteoric rise in the pastoral world
and for his extensive pastoral enter-
prises in the Commonwealth. Mr.
William Naughton assumed the
responsibility of superintending the
operations of his firm in Queensland,
while the New South Wales and
southern interests were under the
control of Mr. E. Naughton, in con-
junction with Mr. J. Linane, who
had been in the Messrs. Naughton’s
employ for a period of 15 years. In
1903 bullocks were purchased from
“Gurandangie,” on the Georgina
River, Queensland, and a start was
made to overland the mob to Ade-
laide, but en route the cattle were
sold to Mr. Sidney Kidman. During
the years 1903 to 1906 Mr. Naughton
made regular visits to his varied
interests in Queensland and New
South Wales. “Eastmere” was sold
in 1906, and in the same year cattle
were purchased from “Caloola”
Station, Northern Queensland, and
despatched to “Murrimgle” Sta-
tion, New South Wales, in charge of
Mr. James Nulty. The following
year witnessed Mr. Naughton’s
return to New South Wales, where
he took over the personal manage-
ment of “Murrimgle” Station,
remaining two years. During the
years up to 1910 the firm was follow-
ing its usual vigorous policy in the
handling of properties, and in addi-
tion to “Eastmere” and “Mur-
rimgle,” owned “Bedooba” Sta-
tion, New South Wales, a run of
180.000 acres, stocked with 30,000
sheep, which they bought in 1906
and sold three years later. “Lyla
Springs” Station, 240,000 acres,
stocked with 5,000 cattle, was also
secured in 1907, and ultimately sold
to Messrs. Cowan Bros. “Kejulla-
gah” Station, near Hilston, New
South Wales, comprising 140,000
acres, and “Moola” Station, 150,000
acres, in the same district, both
unstocked, passed into their hands
in 1907 and 1908. Both these runs
were lightly stocked by the firm,
and retained as relief country for
“Murrimgle” Station. “Ginda-
booka” Station, near Bourke, New
South Wales, comprising 200,000
acres, stocked with 20,000 sheep and
2.000 head of cattle, was held
by the firm for two years, and
sold in 1910. The foregoing
represent some of the more im-
portant transactions of the firm,
and gives some idea of the magnitude
of its operations in the pastoral
world. In 1910 Queensland held
out beckoning arms to Mr. William
Naughton, and he decided to dispose
of his interests in the firm of E. and
W. Naughton and return to the
Northern State. To this end the
brothers divided their interests, Mr.
E. Naughton taking over the estates
in the Riverina district, New South
Wales, and Mr. William Naughton
the properties on the Darling River
and in Queensland. Subsequent to
his return to Queensland he took up
“Durrie,” a tract of 2,000 square
miles, on the Diamantina River,
above Birdsville, and during the
next two years stocked it with about
8.000 cattle, after three years selling
out to Mr. Sidney Kidman. His
next investment was “Hobartsville,”
near Alpha, in 1911, an area of
between 3,000 and 4,000 square
miles, carrying 6,000 head of cattle,
which he retained for two years, and
sold to Mr. W. K. Dalzell, of
“Dalgi” Station, Barcaldine. In
1912 he purchased “Castle Vale”
Station, west of Springsure, with
about 2,000 head of cattle, and held
it for two years. In 1912 he ex-
tended his operations to Western
Australia by the purchase of “Frog
Hollow,” 400,000 acres in extent,
and still holds the property, to
which he has added two adjoining


areas, bought in 1914 and 1916,
respectively, bringing the total
acreage up to 640,000. The original
property when purchased carried
4.000 cattle, and the last two addi-
tions 5,000 cattle. The cattle have
since increased to over 12,000, and
about 300 horses roam these wide
domains. In 1913 “Frankfield,”
near Clermont, with an area of 250
square miles and some 4,000 to 5,000
cattle, was secured and disposed of
again in 1914, in which year he
bought “Raspberry Creek” Station,
near Rockhampton, containing 200
square miles, and stocked, from Mr.
Hutton, and after cutting it up dis-
posed of it to sundry buyers; and
also “Kiva” and “Peninsular” Sta-
tions, both north of Yeppoon, con-
taining a combined area of 200
square miles. He sold “Kiva,’ but
has retained control of “Peninsular”
Station for relief country. In the
same year “Yandama” and “Fort
Grey” Stations, in New South Wales,
and “Tilcha” Station, South Aus-
tralia, all adjoining, and containing
a total area of 2,200,000 acres, and
carrying 13,000 head of cattle, 400
horses, and 10,000 sheep were pur-
chased. These properties were
worked under one control for two
years, when they were sold by Mr.
Naughton in 1916 to a company in
which Mr. Sidney Kidman was
interested. He next bought a pro-
perty of 200,000 acres, stocked with
about 6,000 cattle, from Messrs.
Arthur Bros., only to part with it
in the following year (1917). In
1916 he bought “Herbert Vale,”
north of Camooweal, and partly
located in the Northern Territory,
with an area of 1,000 square miles,
about 8,000 cattle, and 600 horses,
which he sold immediately to a
syndicate. In 1917 he bought
“Moongool,” Southern Queensland,
comprising 100,000 acres, and 2,000
cattle, and sold it in 1918; “Kan-
garoo Hills,” Northern Queensland,
containing 800 square miles, with
8.000 cattle and 350 horses, selling
in the same year to Ballanger and
Co.; “Mount Mulgrave” Station,
North Cairns district, containing
800 square miles, with 6,000 cattle
and 300 horses (the latter run being
purchased in conjunction with Mr.
E. A. Hawkins, of “Duckerbrook”
Station), and sold it to McLean and
Co. in 1918; and “Conolly” Station,
in the Riverina, New South Wales,
containing 200,000 acres, with 30,000
sheep and a few cattle and horses.
Other purchases in 1917 include
“Freda” and “Canoble” Stations,
north of Millstone, New South Wales,
containing an area of 440,000 acres,
with 30,000 sheep, and a few hun-
dred head of cattle and horses,
which still remain in his possession,
and are carried on under the name
and title of Naughton & Co. In
1918 he purchased “Savana Downs,”
Flinders River, Northern Queens-
land, containing 1,000 square miles,
with 8,000 cattle and 100 horses,
which he sold almost immediately to
Mr. Ray H. Logan, of “Beaufort,”
Queensland, and “Stoneleigh” Sta-
tion, near Ingham, totalling 350,000
acres. Sugar has been grown on
part of the freehold of this run, but
at present the mill is unable to cope
with an increased area, hence the
land is out of commission for sugar-
growing. Mr. Naughton is holding
this estate, which is carrying 7,500
cattle and 250 horses. This brief
outline of some of the transactions
put through by Mr. William Naugh-
ton will serve to indicate that he is
a man who would be remarkable in
a generation of mental giants for
his comprehensive and abounding
knowledge of stock, station, and high
finance. Apart from business affairs
he is always to the fore with advice
and financial assistance in all
wmrthy public movements; indeed,
he is the type of gentleman whose
generous hand is quietly helping
forward many deserving objects
throughout the State. His patriotism
is unbounded, and h© liberally
contributed to the various funds to
aid the gallant heroes who fought so
magnificently on the various battle
fronts during the Great War, his
donations and direct gifts exceeding
£13,000. He married in 1903 Delia,
daughter of Mr. John Nulty, of
Emerald, and there are issue of the
union five sons and one daughter.
His daughter and one of the elder
boys are receiving their education
in Melbourne.
CHARLES LOCH, “Loch Lees,”
Emerald, was born at Goonoogoonoo,
New South Wales, in November,
1853. His boyhood was spent
on “Wallabadah,” owned by the
Peel River Pastoral Co., where
his father, Mr. Thomas Loch, was
employed as overseer; and it was
here that his parent's death occurred.
In 1868, being then in his 16th
year, he started life on his own
account, working on various stations
in the vicinity of his early home
at a wage of ss. per week. The
experience thus gained considerably
augmented the knowledge already
acquired of stock and the general
conditions relating thereto, and
resulted in his obtaining a position
as stockman on “Muggamagill”
Station, on the Barwon River, at
the age of 18 at a wage of £1 per
week. Some five years later he was
able to still further improve his
position, and sailing from the
Mother State as a young man of 23
years he arrived at St. Lawrence,
Queensland, where he opened a
butchering business in partnership
with Mr. Peter Duff. This venture
meeting with but small success, he
relinquished the butchering trade
and directed his energies to the
calling of a carrier, bringing one of
the first loads of wool despatched
from “Rodney Downs” Station, near
Ilfracombe, to the town of Emerald,
a distance covering 200 miles of a
rough track. That trip was re-
munerated at the rate of £5 per ton,
the load consisting of about four
and a half tons of wool. On the safe
delivery of his freight at Emerald
he reloaded his team for Muttaburra
on behalf of Mr. St. John Harding,
a trader of that town, travelling
some 230 miles to his destination,
and receiving the increased cartage
rates of £9 per ton. Later, in the
year 1885, the prevailing rate was
still further increased to £25
per ton owing to the almost
insurmountable difficulties resulting
from the devastating drought of
the period, which were with
much hardship and sacrifice over-
come by the pioneer carriers in their
efforts to fulfil their contracts.
About the year 1886 he abandoned
the carrying trade and took up land
in the vicinity of Emerald, which
was called “Moodewarra.” The
property embraced 50 square miles
of country, which he stocked with
415 head of cattle, these being a good
class of five-year-old cows, which
according to the then prevailing
values of horned stock were worth
from £1 to £1 10s. per head. This
venture was followed by the selection
of 20,000 acres on “Lilyvale,” at
time of writing in the hands
of Messrs. Heggarty Brothers; but
after working this proposition for
a while, he realized that the low
prices offered for beef cattle (6s. to
7s. per cwt.) did not allow of suffi-
cient return to run the place at a
profit. He consequently sold out for
the cost of improvements to Mr. W.
Allen, “Withersfield,” and for the
time being confined his energies to
the development of “Moodewarra.”
In the year 1899, he acquired “Loch
Lees,” an area of 10,000 acres, to


which he has since added other selec-
tions, bringing the combined acreage
to a total of 17,000. Some two years
after the acquirement of the above
property, he was overtaken by the
disastrous drought of 1902, which
resulted in his forfeiture of “Moode-
warra,” which was practically wiped
out, and the loss of 70 horses and
nearly all his cattle, only 35 head
having been saved out of a herd of
700. He bravely faced this heavy
reverse, restocking “Loch Lees” with
cattle and sheep, his efforts being
rewarded with fair success until the
year 1914, when he was again obliged
to face the disheartening conse-
quences of another scourge, the
drought of 1914-5, which cost him 50
per cent, of his stock, only 120 head
of cattle and a flock of 1,700 ewes
having survived its ravages, the herd
previously numbering between 700
and 800 head. With the flood which
occurred in Clermont in the year
1917, came the culminating disaster
in a life of many vicissitudes, when
the whole of his remaining stock and
costly improvements, which included
25 miles of wire-netted fencing, etc.,
were washed away. The victims
included 50 horses, among them
being a stallion valued at <£loo and
mares for which he had paid 40
guineas. Seven horses, forty cattle,
and a young bullock, which were
landed bythe flood at “Bonnie Doon”
station, 40 miles away, were all
that Mr. Loch saved from the wreck
of his fortunes. However, with the
courage and grit which have always
distinguished him, he set to work
to restore the havoc wrought by the
latest visitation, and securing finan-
cial assistance purchased 3,000 ewes
at 275. 6d. per head to restore his
acres. In the same year (1917) the
flies were responsible for the loss of
500 of this flock, despite constant
attention by means of spraying.
Later he purchased 1,200 ewes at
225. 6d. per head, losing 200 of them
from the same cause. Mr. Loch’s
experiences are instances of the
extraordinary recuperative powers of
the Queen State, and show how a
few good seasons can rapidly re-
compense for the heavy losses
sustained in a bad one. His
faith in the future of Queens-
land is great, despite the many
setbacks which have marked his
personal career, and in his opinion,
this State, strengthened with an
adequate population, and by the
exploitation of the great sub-artesian
waters, and by further railway
facilities for the removal of stock
r 2
from drought-stricken areas, may be
rendered safe from much of the
disaster attendant upon these and
other visitations, such as the tick
pest and consequent fever. Mr.
Loch’s leases of his selections are
for 21 years, and he has now
only three remaining years in
which to recuperate his losses.
He takes a keen interest in public
affairs, having been a member of
the Peak Downs Council, and at
time of writing is a member of the
Shire Council at Emerald. Mr.
Loch married in 1881, Catherine,
daughter of the late Mr. Tom
jDuffy, who formerly resided in
Emerald, and has a family of five
sons and a daughter. His son Percy
Alexander Loch joined the A.I.F.
at Brisbane and saw active service
with the colours in France.
CHARLES GRANT GALL, J.P.,
owner of “Eastwood” and “Sway-
lands,” and manager of the Mount
Enniskillen Pastoral Co., was born
on June 22, 1876. He is the third
son of the late James Gall, of Elgin-
shire, Scotland, whose forbears were
established in the farming industry
near the town of Elgin for many
generations. The kinship of the Gall
family with the old Gordon clan—
so justly renowned from time im-
memorial for its glorious and history-
making achievements in the annals
of Scotland —is recorded in the
ancient Cathedral at Elgin in asso-
ciation with the names of Ellis and
Goldie, which represent other
branches of the same line. The first
scion of the Gall family to exchange
the “Land of brown heath and
shaggy wood” for the, newer world
under the Southern Cross was Mr.
James Gall, who sailed for Australia
in 1888, and is now a pastoral land-
owner in the Barcoo district. Some
three years later he was followed by
his brother, Mr. Charles Grant Gall,
who is the subject of this memoir.
The latter gentleman received his
education at the Nottingham High
School, and on the conclusion of his
career at this academy entered upon
a course of training in engineering.
After serving a short period of
apprenticeship to the profession, how-
ever, the possibilities latent in the
wide areas of the Island Continent
of Australia, so vividly described by
his elder brother who had already
settled there, induced him to relin-
quish his professional career and set
sail for the land of promise. In
the year 1892 he arrived at Brisbane
in the British India Company’s ship
“Avoca,” being then at the age of
16. Shortly afterwards, under the
auspices of Ids brother, he was initi-
ated into the pastoral life of the
country, and within a year he was
in occupation of the post of jackaroo
at “Jondaryan” Station, the his-
torical estate which is now in the
hands of The Jondaryan Estates Co.
of Australia, Ltd. The run was then
owned by Messrs. Kent & Wienholt,
and was under the management of
the late Charles Williams, who at
that time was considered one of the
best sheep experts in the Common-
wealth. He proved an apt pupil
under the experienced administration
of his late employer, benefiting to
such an extent by that gentleman’s
knowledge and judgment, and by his
own industry and study of his work,
that within two years he was
appointed to the post of overseer and
under-manager, subsequently accept-
ing the full charge and responsibility
of this important property during the
late Mr. Williams’ prolonged absence
in England. He spent some 12 years
in the fulfilment of his duties on
“Jondaryan,” relinquishing his con-
nection with the estate at the termin-
ation of this period in order to enter
the industry on his own behalf in
the Roma district in partnership
with the cousins, Messrs. Daniel and
Humphrey (now Major) Wienholt,
D.S.O. This connection was mutually
dissolved two years later, and Mr.
Gall undertook the management of
“Widgee,” a property in the Wide
Bay district, for Mr. Arnold Wien-
holt during that gentleman’s absence
from the Commonwealth. He was
subsequently appointed manager of
“Saltern Creek” Station, in the
vicinity of Barcaldine, by the
Messrs. Wienholt, and was occupied
with the administration of this pro-
perty until the year 1909, when,
having been offered the management
of “Mount Enniskillen” by the pre-
sent owners, he accepted this respon-
sible post, and has since been
occupied with the duties connected
therewith. During his administra-
tion as manager of the Mount Ennis-
killen Pastoral Co. the property has
been converted into a highly-
improved sheep and cattle proposi-
tion, the success of which has fully
demonstrated his knowledge of stock
and matters relating thereto. While
still retaining his connection with
the above estate, he again embarked
in the industry on his own account,
purchasing “Eastwood,” a property


of nearly 30,000 acres, from Messrs.
Clarke & Tait, in the year 1912.
This proposition is devoted to sheep-
raising, and is personally adminis-
tered by Mr. Gall from “Mount
MR. C. G. GALL.
Enniskillen” with the assistance of
an overseer. Since his acquirement
of “Eastwood” he has added to his
landed interests by the purchase of
an adjoining property called “Sway-
lands,” which embraces 10,000
MR. W. G. GALL.
acres of country, and is also
devoted to the wool - producing in-
dustry. The nature of both proper-
ties is similarly indicated, their
areas being composed of open downs
varied with belts of gidya scrub, and
yielding a plentiful supply of Mit-
chell, blue, and the many excellent
varieties of grass and herbage
indigenous to the Barcoo district.
“Eastwood” and “Swaylands” are
highly-developed properties, both in
regard to water conservation, in
respect of which the runs are well
provided, and structural improve-
ments, such as the excellent sub-
division of the estate into the neces-
sary paddocks, etc. With regard to
the flocks, the price commanded by
the “Eastwood” wool clip is sufficient
evidence of the high development
reached in this direction. “East-
wood” is situated 26 miles south of
Blackall, and the site of “Sway-
lands” is distant 12 miles from that
town. Mr. Gall has been prominently
connected with the public life of the
Barcoo district since his advent
thereto, and has been one of the
leading spirits who have been and
are largely responsible for the success
of its institutions. He was created
a Justice of the Peace by the Liberal
Administration of 1907. In 1911 he
became a member of the Tambo Shire
Council, in which he has held office
ever since, having filled the chair in
that body for more than five years.
He is president of the Tambo Hos-
pital Committee and )Of the local
Marsupial Board, and is fully alive
to the advantage of keeping these
bodies abreast of the times so as to
secure the best results for the tax-
payers and people generally. He is a
strong advocate for the linking up
of the chief railway lines of Southern
and Central Queensland, to the con-
summation of which end his every
effort is directed, and eventually,
when this scheme is an accomplished
fact, due credit will be accorded to
his efforts in this direction. Mr.
Gall is a good sport, and encourages
by his practical support all clean
forms of outdoor recreation, being
actively connected with the bodies
instituted for this end at Blackall.
He is president of the Tambo Race
Club and is a member of the Blackall
Club. The honour of his name and
line was upheld in the Great War by
three of his brothers—Gordon,
Ernest, and William Gall—one of
whom, Ernest, as a sergeant in the
King’s Royal Rifles, was called upon
to make the supreme sacrifice at
Hooge, in Flanders, in July, 1915.
His brother, Lieutenant Gordon Ellis
Gall, served also in Flanders as a
member of the A.I.F. He was twice
wounded, and was returned to the
land of his adoption as unfit for fur-
ther service. He later held the post of
diocesan registrar under His Grace
LIEUT. G. E. GALL.
Archbishop Donaldson, in Brisbane.
William also joined the A.1.F., and
met a soldier's death at Yillers
Brettoneux, France. Mr. Charles
Grant Gall married in 1909 Heather,
daughter of Sir Alfred Cowley,
MR. E. S. GALL.

of the Crown in Queensland. Of
the union there is a family of two
sons and two daughters.


JOHN HENRY HART, ‘ Spring-
field,” Blackall. The subject of this
sketch is one of those exceptionally
fine types of Englishmen who have
pioneered the nation in all parts of
the British dominions. Such men
led the way in Australia, New
Zealand, Canada, and elsewhere,
wherever the flag of the British race
floated. In the early days of
Australia they ranked among them
explorers such as Hume, Sturt.
Leichhardt, Gregory, and the
Jardines, men afraid of no obstacles
and undaunted in the face of all
dangers. Many of our early
squatters were endowed with the
same splendid qualities, arriving
from the cities, towns, and villages
of the Old World, some fresh from
schools, colleges, and universities,
and all animated with unconquerable
courage as they pioneered the vast
unknown spaces of their adopted
country, braving the far solitudes of
the West and North. These are the
real nation builders, the men who
lay the solid foundations of empires.
Such men are usually and
unassuming, with a stem unflinching
code of honour that commands the
confidence of all classes of men. The
life of Mr. J. H. Hart reads in
reality like a romance. Born in
1851 in Toddington, Bedfordshire, he
started work as a boy in that quaint
old Roman town of St. Albans in
the same county, where Agricola,
the Roman general, had one of his
principal camps. But Hart had in
him the spirit of Drake, Frobisher,
and Dampier, and at a time when
newly discovered goldfields in
Australia were calling with a
thousand tongues to the world’s
young adventurers, he and a chum
sailed for the Southern Continent in
Davitt & Moore’s windjammer,
“Collingwood,” their chief capital
being strong hands, high hopes, and
resolute hearts. After an exception-
ally rough voyage, during which they
narrowly escaped shipwreck, the two
lads, who had paid for their
passages with good honest work,
arrived at Sandridge, the Port
Melbourne of to-day, and there the
paths diverged, Goodyear remaining
in Melbourne, and Harry Hart,
having a natural bent towards stock
breeding and a pastoral life, setting
out for a station near Echuca, on
the Murray. Droving trips made
him a busliman and expert horseman,
and gave him a knowledge over a
wide expanse of country; and later
his energetic disposition caused him
MR. J. H. HART.
to undertake contracts for fencing,
shearing, and dam sinking, at all of
which he acquired the skill born
only of practical experience, Harry
Hart being no kid-glove overseer of
his own work. Finally he came to
Queensland —much to the benefit of
the Northern State—on behalf of
two Lachlan River squatters named
Oliver and Smith, who secured his
services per contract for extensive
fencing and dam making. But his
ambition soared far above fencing
and dam making, however useful
that work may be, and in the early
90’s he became the owner of the
now celebrated “Springfield” and
“Springleigh” stations, the latter
being famous for the deepest artesian
bore in Australia, and one that
probably no other man in Australia
would have either started or finished
under the circumstances. He
selected the site of this bore, and
with amazing optimism and
determined enterprise, regardless of
cost, he has continued it until it is
now down to a depth of over
6,800 feet, which ranks with the
deepest in the world, passing
through a great variety of stratas,
striking salt water at 300 feet, fresh
water at 2,000 feet, and three more
fine flows in succession, but some of
these consisted of bad water not
suitable for either domestic or stock
purposes. A flow of 80,000 gallons
daily was struck at 4,185 feet,
and one of 85,000 gallons at
5,400 feet. At 6,000 feet came a
good flow at a temperature of 197
degrees. At 5,450 feet was a strata
of black petroleum wax, a very
important discovery. Samples of the
water show silica, iron, carbonates
of calcium, magnesium, and sodium,
a sulphate of calcium and sodium
chloride. The Springfield country
had been previously passed over
through having no permanent
surface water, but Mr. Hart soon
overcame that difficulty by construct-
ing a huge dam. On Springfield he
built his home, one of the best and
most complete in the West. To this
property he added “Thornleigh” and
“Moorlands.” Truly marvellous is the
evolution of that Bedfordshire child
born in 1851 to the grand old success-
ful squatter of to-day, a man who
has done much and created much,
and is leaving his mark on Queens-
land’s history as one of our most
enterprising and successful colonists.
He owns 14,000 acres near Oxley, the
“Archerfield”—once owned by
Mcllwraith—and interests in coal
and gold mines, and in asbestos and
phosphates. He is a director of
Moreheads, Ltd., Surgical Supplies,
Ltd., and was for years member of
a western shire council, and a
director of the Central Queensland
E. & M. Company, the Blackall
Wool Scour Coy., and the Blackall
Iceworks Coy. Of his artistic home
at Manly, thirteen miles from
Brisbane, he might say with Horace,
“Fairest of all the scenes on earth,
that place is dear to me,” and there,
indeed, he is a valuable local citizen,
and a true loyal friend. At time of
writing he is still in the prime
and vigour of his manhood, active
and athletic looking, many years
younger than his age, keen and alert,
mentally and physically, still fully
capable of continuing for a long
period to come that useful and
honourable life which is ensuring for
him an enviable record in Queens-
land’s history.


JAMES ARTHUR, J.P., “Brae-
side,” Barcaldine, was boni at
Gladstone, Queensland, on February
12, 1859, the year in which Queens-
land was declared an independent
Colony. He is a son of the late
James Arthur, an Englishman who
came to Sydixey in the very early
days, having been a type of those
sturdy British sons of toil, so many
of whom woxked their way into the
interior in search of grazing lands,
and whose grit and fearlessness
were their sole safeguards in those
days when nature ordained that only
the fittest should survive the work
of opening up the newly discovered
Continent. It would be difficult to
picture the privations faced by such
men as the late Mr. Arthur, whose
lives were in constant danger from
treacherous and warlike natives, and
who suffered indescribable hardships,
often lacking water through weary
tramps, and forced to content them-
selves with the roughest food to
sustain them in the strenuous life of
their choice, their only reward the

happily people the fair lands in

hampton and at the Kynuna dig-
gings as far back as the middle
fifties. He afterwards settled down

of Queensland put an end to the
transport of goods by road. AVhile
yet in the prime of manhood he
joined the Great Majority, leaving
an honoured name to his surviving
famjly of two sons and four daugh-
ters. The younger son who was a
well-known athlete of his day, died
suddenly in his twenty-first year,
and to the remaining son, James,
was left the duty of honourably
perpetuating the family name. Such
scholastic training as was acquired
by Mr. James Arthur was received
in his early years in the town of
Gladstone, Queensland, the most
valuable part of his education hav-
ing been gained in the school of
experience in the course of an
arduous existence in the land of his
birth. In this year he studied to
some purpose, and though deprived
of the opportunities afforded by the
educational facilities of a later
generation, and in spite of many
obstacles and hardships in the way of
his progress, he has most emphati-
cally made good, his success being
marked by qualities of honour and
straightforwardness that have made

show that the founder of the Arthur

the calling of a carrier, until the
advent of the railway to that part
the name of “Jimmy” Arthur res-
pected from the seacoast to the fax-
interior, extending even to the


Kimberley district in the Western
State. Before his ninth year he was
employed in herding stud cattle at
Rodds Bay for the late Albert
Norton—a well-known public iden-
tity of that period—his evenings
being at that time devoted to the
study which under normal conditions
should have filled his day hours.
General stock work, which included
horse-breaking, droving, etc., occu-
pied him until the attainment of his
sixteenth year, by which time he had
accumulated sufficient savings to
acquire a small carrying plant, start-
ing operations with a few bullocks
and horses. The route chosen for
his travels lay between Rockhampton
and St. Lawrence and through the
intervening country as far west as
and his stock. Mr. Arthur, however,
always managed to keep the
aggressors at a civil distance, and
commanded from them the respect
usually accorded to the white
pioneers whose dealings with them
were both just and firm, in contra-
distinction to the men of less moral
character who too often paid with
their lives the penalty of crime
and recklessness. From Winton he
travelled overland to Normanton,
where he sold his teams and plant.
While at the latter town reports of
the discovery of the Kimberley
goldfields, in the northern part of
Western Australia, attracted his
attention, and he proceeded overland
to that field, taking a line from
Normanton and thence due west.

followed this calling with consider-
able success, handling his own
animals and finding a ready market
close at hand. While still interested
in the horse trade he purchased a
butchering business in Barcaldine,
which was carried on under his
immediate direction for a brief
period, and subsequently disposed of
at a satisfactory profit. He next
became interested in the hotel
business, becoming “Mine Host” of
the Royal Hotel in the same town,

of the railway, that town being 30
miles west from Rockhampton, and
at that time the terminus of the Gen-
tral line, and until Jericho became
its terminal point he continued in the
carrying trade, his last trip having
been from Jericho to Winton in the
early part of the year 1886. During
the term of years in which he pur-
sued his arduous calling he was
obliged to exercise excessive tact,
wariness, and self-denial on account
of the aborigines who usually
congregated around waterholes, thus
rendering extreme caution necessary
in order to obtain the poor supplies
which these sources afforded for
refreshment to the tired traveller
Realizing after a time that the
potentialities of these diggings were
over-estimated he returned across
country to Croydon, where, putting
behind him the lure of the goldfields,
he decided to give the pastoral
industry a trial. Proceeding to the
Leichhardt district he purchased a
block of grazing country, devoting
the five ensuing years to the
strenuous work of improving this
property, being aided in the task by
his expert knowledge of bushcraft.
At the termination of the above
mentioned period, in 1891, he
disposed of his holding and returned
to Central Queensland, where he
became engaged in the trade of horse-
dealing. Being himself a fine
equestrian and one of the best judges
into the market at about the same
time as a result of the prevailing
drought. Qualities of energy, perse-
verance, and industry, combined
with an integrity of word and
character and a keen knowledge of
stock and the land gained through
a varied and strenuous experience
of the conditions relating thereto,
resulted in his firm establishment in
the industry among the neighbour-
ing pastoralists, and his success
stands out as an example of the
attainment possible to men endowed
with such sterling characteristics as
those possessed by Mr. Arthur,
The property made up by the above-
mentioned blocks was named “Brae-
side,” and is conducted by Mr.
Arthur in conjunction with


“Lochenvar,” an estate acquired at a
later date, the total area owned by
him aggregating some 47,000 acres.
Both runs are well developed, five
artesian bores having been put down
under his ownership, these affording
pastoral operations, and has bred
some fine animals on his “Braeside”
property. A small dairy herd of
shorthorns is also maintained for
domestic purposes. The “Braeside”
residence is situated six miles from

in the “sport of Kings,” and is on

THOMAS DUFFY, “Mount

Annies, County Monaghan, Ireland,
on May 28, 1873, and is the fifth
son of the late Patrick Duffy, a
MR. T. DUFFY.
descendant of a long line of farming
progenitors and a member of a
family whose name has been borne
by many Irishmen of professional
and political distinction and several
eminent Churchmen. The gentleman
under review was educated at the
National School at Bloomfield. At
an early age he was contributing his
share towards the upkeep of the
paternal acres, and was so occupied
until the completion of his seven-
teenth year, when, fully convinced
that under conditions then existing
in Ireland it would be impossible to
make any headway in the agricul-
tural industry, he decided to face
the future abroad. Accordingly he
set out for Australia, and in due
course arrived at Brisbane, landing
on May 28, 1888. Possessing but a
trifling sum in the way of capital,
he immediately sought such employ-
ment as might offer with the view
of becoming familiar with his new
environment, and very shortly ob-
tained a junior post with the firm of
W. H. Blaney, of South Brisbane.
His first position in the city was fol-
lowed by another before he became
fully cognizant of the possibilities of
various phases of bush life, which,
ere he had been a year iu the
country, he determined to test.

Brisbane to Mitchell, lie proceeded
to the Barcco in search of employ-
ment, and finally obtained work as
a station hand on “Northampton
Downs.” He continued as an
employe amongst the stock here until
given an opportunity of joining a
tank-sinking staff then operating on
the run under the direction of the
Stratford Bros., whose early pioneer-
ing experiences are recounted in
another part of this work. Subse-
quently he took to shearing, being
initiated to the use of the shearing
machines in the “Terrick Ter-
rick” sheds in the early part of the
year 1890. Thereafter, for some
considerable time, he followed the
calling in various parts of the Com-
monwealth and New Zealand, his
journeys being largely actuated by
the definitely formed objective of
gaining a knowledge of the pastoral
conditions of both countries before
finally investing in landed interests
the capital he was slowly accumu-

tract shearer in partnership with
Messrs. Sinclair and Kerr. The
connection continuing for one season
only, he subsequently entered upon
an independent career as a shearing
contractor, starting in a compara-
tively small way, and, in the begin-
ning, widening his sphere of opera-
tions by taking on various building
contracts in partnership with Mr.
George Butler, of Tambo. In time

for which he was noted, strongly com-
mending him to the large landowners
and winning for him the most ex-
tensive connection held by any
individual shearing contractor in
Queensland. It may be safely said
that few men in that or any other
independent calling have so com-
pletely won the confidence of em-
ployers and employes alike, a fact
which, the outcome of consistently
upright dealing, accounts for the
almost immediate settlement of diffi-
culties of a kind that in the history
of the industry have often grown to
lamentable dimensions. He made
Barcaldine his headquarters, and in
the early part of his residence there
interested himself in the pastoral
industry, and, aj>art from “Mount
Arthur,” which he acquired in the
year 1916, owns other grazing in-
terests, both in the Central and
Southern districts of the State.
“Mount Arthur” covers an area of
over 25,000 acres and is situated on
the Alice River, at a distance of
40 miles from Barcaldine. Origin-
ally a portion of “Abington” Sta-

been known to fail. To the bores
are attached all necessary equipment
in the shape of up-to-date windmills,


troughing, etc., and the stock, com-
prising sheep, cattle, and horses, are
most conveniently served. The sheep,
which are of the popular merino
strain, are the mainstay of the place,
the present flock having been founded
with ewes from “Minnie Downs”
and rams imported from the South.
The run is capable of carrying a
flock of 8,000 in an average season.
At time of writing a modern home-
stead is in course of construction,
though the original dwelling erected
by the previous owner still stands.
Mr. Duffy well exemplifies the type
of citizen who, while avoiding pub-
licity, unobtrusively accomplishes
a great deal for the good of the com-
munity. He has ever actively in-
terested himself in the welfare of the
districts in which he has at different
times resided, and during the late
war was instrumental in forwarding
various patriotic movements, giving
generously not only of monetary sup-
port, but of his time and well-known
gift for organization. It should be

At “Terrick Terrick” he subscribed

shed labourers there, so great was
his desire to widen the movement.
He generously assists all charitable
projects. Bodies for the furtherance
of clean manly sports have his whole-
hearted co-operation, and, in his
younger days in the Old World, he
was considered fast between the
lines in first-class football. Ever
since his advent to Central Queens-
land he has actively supported
amateur racing, and in annual
events in the district his horses have
met with marked success. In the
year 1906 he married Mary Ellen,
daughter of the late Michael Lynch,
of “Porcupine Plains,” an old
Queensland pioneer and one of the
earliest Irish settlers here. Hailing
originally from the South of Ire-
land, the late gentleman was a con-
tractor on the Queensland Central
Railway line for many years. During
his long connection with this branch
of development he made many
friends, the good which he per-
formed in conjunction with his wife,
who survives him, in what were then
mere outposts of civilization, being
constantly referred to when old
memories are recalled by his con-
temporaries of the early days. Mrs.
Lynch now resides in Barcaldine.
Mr. and Mrs. Duffy have a family
of three sons and three daughters.


JOHN DIXON McAULIFFE,
J.P., “Stagmount,” Aramac, was
born on November 11, 1859, at
“Coulagh,” County Cork, Ireland,
and is the third son of the late
THE LATE D. MCAULIFFE.
Dennis McAuliffe, and a descendant
of very ancient Celtic stock which
has produced many illustrious mem-
bers during various eras of Irish
history. Many of his progenitors
occupied important landed estates in
Ireland and were prominent in the
field of letters and as legal lights in
Dublin, even before the days of the
Grattan Parliament. The claims of
the McAuliffe family to antiquity
have been borne out by various
authors who have studied the
traditions of the Isle of “Saints and
Scholars,” and the name is ever
given a prominent place in the lists
of patriots whose lives were bound
up in the welfare of their country.
Their arms and crest belong to the
period when these badges of distinc-
tion were the reward of personal
courage and other noble attributes,
and their possession is a legacy that
should appeal to the same high
qualities in those of the name who
worthily bear it in a far-distant
land. The McAuliffe family ex-
perienced many changes of condition
during the different decades of its
history, various causes, political and
otherwise, tending to this end, so
that eventually they in their turn
became tenant farmers, the late
Dennis McAuliffe occupying a pro-
perty in County Cork, and at the
same time engaging in contract work.
He married a member of the Bailey
family, who were, and are to this
day, prominently identified with
professional and mercantile pursuits
in the city of Cork. Mr. J. D.
McAuliffe was educated at Rock
Chapel School, in County Cork, and
on the termination of his studies
assisted his father and brothers in
their agricultural operations on the
home farm and on “Stagmount,” a
property in the same County origin-
ally owned by his mother, who was
born thereon, and which came into
the possession of the late Dennis
McAuliffe after his marriage. The
latter place eventually became the
home of the family which, by this
time, had increased in numbers, and
realizing from this fact that their

places could be filled by the younger
brothers, the gentleman under re-
view and his eldest brother decided
to try their fortunes in Australia,
where the prospects of ultimate suc-
cess were markedly brighter than in
the limited spaces of their native
land, and accordingly embarked for
their destination in April, 1880. On
arrival in New South Wales the
elder brother turned his attention to
mercantile pursuits and later became
interested in mining ventures. The
younger, however, chose the land as
the basis of a livelihood, and obtained
a position as jackaroo on “Lamb’s
Valley” Station, near Maitland,
New South Wales. Though this post
was no sinecure, the work being
strenuous, the hours long, and the
remuneration only £3O a year, he
persevered with the determination
of gaining a thorough knowledge of
the pastoral industry, and at the end
of two years had the satisfaction of
knowing that his capability was
recognized, receiving an offer of the
management of “Barcoorah” Sta-
tion, Central Queensland, from the
late Mr. Ennis, the then owner, in
the year 1882. He accepted the post,
taking over his duties in April of
that year and continuing in the ad-
ministration of the estate until its
disposal seven years later. On relin-
quishing control of “Barcoorah” he
was offered the management of
“Powella,” a station situated near
Aramac and owned at that time by
the Hon. Simon Fraser. The
administration of the “Powella”
acres occupied him until the year
1895, and under his energetic and
progressive regime a large amount of
developmental work was completed,
the improvements effected including
the first artesian bore sunk on the
estate. He severed his connection
with the above-mentioned property
in order to enter the industry on his
own account, taking up the block of
country upon which his present
homestead now stands. This block
consisted of 20,000 acres, which were
part of the resumption of the old
“Stainburn Downs” Station, and to
its development he immediately

devoted all his efforts, expending the
small capital at his command in
necessary improvements. He named
the property “Stagmount,” after his
old home in Ireland. For the first


two years he was domiciled in a tent,
and during this period, as a means of
still further augmenting his capital
and to enable him to carry on his
developmental operations, he leased
the production of wool, breeding
only to a small extent. Previous to
the drought of 1901-3 his flock
numbered 10,000, but as the result
of that disastrous visitation it was
backed up by a wide experience
could command success. By breeding
and small purchases he slowly in-
creased his flock, his affairs gradually
assuming a brighter aspect, and in
his acres to neighbouring graziers for
agistment purposes. As soon as he
saw his way clear he purchased a
number of wethers from “Brook-
wood,” which shortly afterwards

calculated to dishearten the most
optimistic of settlers. However,
having great faith in Queensland
and possessing a nature not easily

to secure a further area of 20,000
acres. This property, which he
named “Ballyneety,” after the home
of his wife’s people in the Emerald

present flock, which was founded on
sheep bred on “Aramac” Station.
Thereafter he used his country
chiefly for fattening purposes and for

described as “desert” country, which

on its pastures. It is now reserved
chiefly for relief country, though at
time of writing it is depastured with
a particularly fine herd of short-
horns, the strain of which has been
improved from time to time by the
introduction of stud bulls imported
from Victoi'ia and New South Wales.
In the year 1908, being encouraged
by the success attending his former
ventures, Mr. McAuliffe selected
property in Ireland, his three separ-
ate enterprises in his adopted country
being thus associated in sentiment
with the Homeland. He personally
administers the entire area, which
aggregates some 60,000 acres and
forms one of the most desirable
pastoral propositions in Central
Queensland, the mixed country com-
prising the so-called “desert” land
making for safety when the expans-

high standard by regular importa-
tions of rams from that well-known
stud. Horses are bred in sufficient
numbers for station use. Mr.
McAuliffe takes a keen interest in all
matters relating to stock and keeps
well abreast of the times in
regard to the scientific methods of
breeding both sheep and cattle. All
the properties have been brought to
a high state of development, the
improvements being of the most up-
to-date description, and including
three bores, two of which have been
fitted with pumping plants. These
bores produce an ample supply of
excellent water for the needs of the
stock, which are further provided for
by several small lagoons in the beds
of the various creeks which intersect
the runs. Each property has been
subdivided into conveniently-sized
paddocks, the areas being used to
the best advantage as a result of the
keen knowledge of stock and their
requirements and the thorough cog-
nizance of the conditions of the area
which he administers, acquired by
the owner during the past quarter of
a century. On September 1, 1919,
Mr. McAuliffe purchased “Barbar-

acquired area will be worked in con-
junction with Mr. McAuliffe’s other


holdings, already described. The

hospital committee. For a similar
period he has occupied a seat on the
board of the Aramac Shire Council,
which, during his term of office, did
much to forward the progress and
development of the district. He
actively supported the building of
the Aramac tramway—a light rail-
way connecting the district with the
Limerick, during his lifetime, his
progenitors having established them-
selves in that portion of the country
many generations ago. After ten
years of married life, during which
she nobly aided the efforts of her
husband amid the many vicissitudes
of pastoral life, this lady was called
to her reward. Of the union there

well to the fore, and as a practical
member of the faith of his fathers
he has worthily contributed to its
support, both he and his family
being largely responsible for the erec-
tion of the Roman Catholic Church
daughters. A few years after the
death of his first wife Mr. McAuliffe
contracted a union with her sister,
Katherine, who has since devoted
herself to the interests of her hus-
band and the loving care of the

FRANCIS ARTHUR HEWSON,
J.P., “Dalmore,” Longreach, was
born at Finuge House, Listowel,
County Kerry, Ireland, and is the
youngest son of the late William
Minchin Flewson, of Finuge House,
County Kerry. The late gentleman
was a member of the Hewson family
of Castle Hewson, County Limerick,
the line being of Norman origin, a
branch of it having settled in York-
shire, England, prior of the days of
Queen Elizabeth, and subsequently,
during the reign of that monarch,
offshoots from the English branch
migrated to Limerick, where they
have since been established, the
family connection extending eventu-
ally into County Kerry. The Hewson
family has been represented in. the
Church, the army, and navy, its
members having attained to promin-
ence in these various fields. Mr. F.
A. Hewson received his education
in Dublin and in England, and on
the conclusion of his studies, being
then in his teens, set sail for
Australia in order to join his father
and other members of his family who
had arrived in the Island Continent a
realization of its wonderful pastoral
character. The late Mr. Hewson

land, and owing to this bereavement

advice he decided to turn to the
land for a livelihood, and obtained a
position with the late William
Collins, of “Nindooinbah.” His
first task was the overlanding of a
mob of horses from “Tamrookum”
to “Westgrove” Station, in the
Mitchell district, in company with
the late Grenville Arthur Kingsley,
a son of the well-known author,
Charles Kingsley. Arriving with
his charges, he remained on
the latter estate in the capacity
of jackaroo for the following
18 months, at the end of this
time returning to “Tamrookum”
with a mob of cattle. He was later
transferred to “Eulolo” Station, in
the Far West, which also belonged to
the Collins family, remaining there
for some years under the able tuition
of the then manager, Mr. Frank
Higginson (since deceased), and
obtaining a thorough insight into
the work connected with the hand-
ling and management of sheep. In
the year 1895, having resigned from
the Collins proprietary, he went to

cultured gentleman, Mr. de Burgh
Persse, whose biography appears in

Ferrier was manager, and on the
death of that gentleman remained on
the property under the management


of Mr. Guy Wynne Peyton, from
whom he subsequently purchased
“Dunstan,” an estate situated near
Augathella. He administered the
latter concern on his own account
for about seven or eight years,
disposing of it to the present owners,
Messrs. Lord Bros., at the end of
that time, and purchasing “Strath-
finella,” near Longreach, in the year
1914. This estate was held for a
brief period, at the end of which it
was disposed of to Mr. Willcocks, the
transaction being immediately fol-
lowed by the acquirement of “Dal-
more,” near Longreach, to which
purchase he devoted his energies for
the breeding of blood horses, having
owned such notably successful sires
as “Lurcher,” by “Gossoon” (imp.),
and “Earlston” (imp.). Many well-
known performers on the turf were
bred by him, these including horses
of the stamp of “Master Warkon”
(“Lurcher” —“Palm Olive”), and his
knowledge of horseflesh is such as to
have gained for him the reputation
of being a keen judge of blood stock.
Mr. Hewson was created a Justice
of the Peace by the Kidson Adminis-
tration. Lie is a member of the
Longreach Club, the Queensland
Club (Brisbane), and the Australian
Club (Sydney). He married Sarah
until the time of his death which
occurred in 1910. The founder of
the branch of the Rowan family
which is now represented at “Tally-
rand,” was one of the best-known
citizens of his adopted country. Ho
hailed from Newry, County Down,
Ireland, his forbears having peopled
the northern part of that country for
generations, though the family is of
Scottish origin, having come to
Ireland after Cromwell’s time. Since
their settlement in the Green Isle,
the line has produced many distin-
guished members who have rendered
prominent service to their country
through the different decades of her
the following four years, when the
property again changed hands,
being sold to a syndicate composed
of Messrs. Ryan, Jeffray, Trude,
and Coleman. Mr. Hewson's policy
has always been to highly improve
each proposition and to stock it to
its fullest carrying capacity, thus
adding to the value of the separate
estates, and by so doing advancing
the industry itself. On the disposal of
“Dalmore” in 1918 he entered into
partnership with Mr. Rowan in
“Tallyrand,” the management and
control being entirely in his hands.
During his career as a pastoral land-
owner he has taken great interest in

pioneer pastoralist of “Canning
Downs.”
JAMES STEPHEN ROWAN,
“Tallyrand,” Longreach, was born
at St. Kilda, Melbourne, on Septem-
ber 15, 1874, and is the eldest son of
the late Andrew Rowan, whose career
in the Island Continent is indelibly
associated with the story of its
development since the period when he
arrived on Australian shores in 1862
history, and contributed largely to
the professional and public life of the
North of Ireland. The Rowan family
has also been identified with the
national ideals; one of its members,
Archibald Hamilton Rowan, a Pro-
testant champion and a leader of the
Home Rule movement in Ireland,
being regarded as one of the country’s
greatest patriots, having been exiled
as a result of the prominence of his
efforts during that particular period.
During the Great World War which
called forth the best blood of the
Empire and which culminated in a
glorious victory for the Allied
Nations, the present generation of


the family was well represented at
the Front, the late Andrew Percival
Rowan, the brother and former
partner of the subject of this notice
having laid down his life at Gallipoli.
He had previously served with
distinction in the Boer War (1899-
1902) receiving the King’s Medal
with three clasps. Two other broth-
ers were also on active service, one
being in the famous Black Watch
Regiment and the other in the Army
Medical Corps. Mr. J. S. Rowan,
the gentleman under review, and his
two brothers failed to pass the
prescribed test when they presented
themselves as candidates for admis-
sion to the ranks of the Australian
Imperial Forces. The late Andrew
Rowan became actively connected
with mercantile pursuits both in
Sydney and Melbourne after his
arrival in the land of the Southern
Cross, and was later identified with
the pastoral industry in a large way,
supervising the conduct of his varied
interests right up to the time of his
death. He was one of the promoters
of the Melbourne Tramway Co.,
chairman of directors of Golds-
brough Mort & Co., and a director
of the Scottish Australian Investment
Co., Ltd. In the early seventies, he
acquired, in partnership with the
late Archibald Fisken and William
Taylor, that well-known Queensland
pastoral property known as “Darr
River Downs,” the partners setting an
example of progressiveness by sinking
on this estate one of the first artesian
bores in Queensland. It is worthy
of mention that the partners had
great faith in the future of Queens-
land as a pastoral country, the late
Mr. Rowan in particular emphasizing
this belief by directing many of his
activities towards the furtherance of
the industry in the Northern State,
owning, in partnership with the
late M. C. Thompson, "Malvern
Downs,” near Clermont, and “Echo
Hills,” “Werribone,” and “Tala-
vera,” in the vicinity of Surat. With
the object of placing the business
of stock-raising in Queensland on a
sound footing he actively concerned
himself in the formation of the
Central Queensland Meat Export
Company at Lakes Creek, Rockhamp-
ton, having been one of the moving
spirits in this concern, which has
since become such an asset in the
pastoral life of the country, and in
which he was a partner. The
Q 2
descendants of this fine old pioneer
may justly claim that the founder of
their line had no small share in the
cradling of the great pastoral indus-
try in Queensland, through his
splendid efforts in connection there-
with both in the early and later
stages of its development. As an
example of the diversity of his
interests and as an historical episode,
it is worthy of mention that at the
first Melbourne Exhibition a prize of
elaborate silver plate, given by the
old Emperor of Germany, William
111., “for the best exhibition of art
or industry,” was won by the late
Mr. Rowan and his partner, Mr.
Hubert de Castella (also deceased)
for a sample of wine from the vintage
of the famous vineyard near Mel-
bourne known as “St. Hubert’s,”
which was established by the above-
named gentlemen. The subject of our
present review was educated at the
Church of England Grammar School,
Melbourne, and on the conclusion of
his course at this academy was sent
to England, having been originally
intended for the army. Owing to
adverse conditions caused by the
great drought of 1901-3, this project
failed to receive fulfilment and
necessitated his return to Melbourne.
Shortly afterwards he entered the
office of Goldsbrough, Mort & Co.,
in that city, where he remained for
two years. At the end of this time
he went to “Werribone” Station in
the capacity of jackaroo and subse-
quently spent two years with the
Central Queensland Meat Export
Company at their Lakes Creek works,
where he became familiar with the
different departments of that busi-
ness. This varied experience stood
him in good stead during his later
career as a landowner, and combined
with his practical connection with the
industry for the past twenty odd
years, has rendered him an expert in
all matters pertaining to stock. He
purchased “Tallyrand” in partner-
ship with his late brother, Andrew
"EARLSTON" (IMP.)
Percival, in the year 1897, admitting
Mr. Hewson to a share in the
property on the latter’s decease,
“Tallyrand” is recognized as one of
the most up-to-date and successful
propositions of its size in the West.
The property at time of purchase
embraced an area of 100,000 acres,
the greater part of which was dis-
posed of at later periods, reducing its
acreage to the present figure of
40,000. The pastures are devoted to
sheep, of which the run is capable of
carrying from 15,000 to 18,000, the
flocks being composed of merinos
founded on “Boonoko” blood which
is kept up to standard by annual


importations from the famous stud
so named, the results being evidenced
by the quality of the wool produced,
which is unsurpassed in the West.
Draught horses of a good strain are

vided into 12 paddocks and the bores
provided with all the necessary and
most up-to-date equipment. The
woolshed is a commodious building

its welfare, and for the past ten years
he has been a member of the Long-
reach Shire Council. In his youthful
days he was a prominent athlete,

ALBERT FRANCIS SMITH,
“Baratria,” Longreach, was born at
Molong, New South Wales, and is a
son of the late Francis Smith, who
during his lifetime was one of the
best-known pastoraliste of the
Mother State, having been engaged
in the industry in the vicinity of
Dubbo. The late gentleman came
of old Celtic stock, hailing
from Cornwall, England, in which
County the family had been estab-
lished for some centuries, many
succeeding generations of the line
having followed agrarian avocations.
He arrived in New South Wales
about sixty years ago, and proceed-
ing to Molong acquired “Comboogle-
Combong” Station, near that town,
in conjunction with his two brothers,
and was engaged in the administra-
tion of that estate up to the time of
his death. The subject of our

received his scholastic training at
All Saints’ College, Bathurst, con-
cluding his school career when at the
age of seventeen years. Shortly
afterwards he proceeded to “Euroka”

Queensland branch of the Doyle
family, and whose sons as partners

in the firm of DOYLE BROTHERS
are largely interested in pastoral
pursuits in different portions of the
the most ancient families of Ireland,
whose lineage dates back to the days
when Dublin was known by the
appellation of “Eblana,” his forbears
having been established for genera-
tions in Rathmines, now a suburb of
that city. The late J. C. Doyle came
to Australia in the early seventies,
having then reached man’s estate,
and preferring (as was the case with
many other members of old Irish
families) to face life in a new country
rather than remain in the land of his
birth under the distasteful conditions
so often imposed by those who failed
to understand the character and
temperament of the Celtic race.
Immediately on his advent to this
Country he became engaged in
various kinds of employment in and
about Brisbane, making a sound
beginning and “getting his bear-
ings,” as it were, in the land of his
adoption. His efforts were soon
rewarded by the appearance of rosier
opportunities, which the young
Irishman invariably “grasped by the
forelock,” and it was one of these
which resulted in his employment at
“Landsdowne,” a station situated
about 500 miles west of the capital
city of the Queen State, where he

fulfilled the duties of a general
station hand. He worked industri-
ously at this place, husbanding his
asset he took to the roads, visiting the
small settlements and stations of the
West. He earned a heterogeneous


collection of articles of commerce,
which were in constant demand, and
which, owing to the lack of regular
supply, would often have been unpro-
curable were it not for the carriers
who braved the perils of the bush and
the hardships attendant thereon in
the pursuit of their business occupa-
tion. His initiative was rewarded by
the confidence and continued custom
of the people amongst whom he
moved, and for a quarter of a
century there was no person better
known or more welcome to the
dwellers of those then outback
places than the late Mr. Doyle.
In the year 1891 he relinquished
trading, and having added to the
lands which he had acquired while in
the carrying business, entered upon
an era of success as a grazier. At
this time his sons were approaching
manhood’s estate and able to assist
materially in the working of the
different properties. They also
rendered valuable help in connection
with the dairying side of the
industry, which was carried on
in conjunction with the pastoral
interests. The late pioneer died in
October, 1906, leaving a family of
four sons and one daughter. During
his lifetime the late Mr. Doyle
owned "Rathmines” and “Carwell”
Stations, in the Tambo district,
which are now controlled by his
sons. The other properties owned
by the Messrs. Doyle Bros, are
"Rosabel,” "Benares,” and “Mac-
farlane,” acquired by purchase, the
last-mentioned run being situated
in the vicinity of Tambo. "Rosabel”
and “Benares” occupy territory near
Arrilalah, in the Mitchell district.
Three of the estates are pastured
with both sheep and cattle, these
covering an area of about 70,000
acres, "Carwell,” with an area of 150
square miles, being entirely devoted
to the breeding of cattle and horses.
In the aggregate the sheep and
cattle run on the several properties
number about 30,000 and 2,000,
respectively, the latter being of the
shorthorn type. The nature of the
country comprising the different runs
is very similar in character, being
indicated by rolling downs, Mitchell
grass, and many varieties of timber,
including gidya, boree, and myall.
The main water supply is provided
by sub-artesian bores and tanks, and
many improvements have been
effected, developmental work being
steadily pushed ahead the whole year
round. Following the decease of
his parent the eldest son, Francis
Christopher, assumed the reins of
management, and continued to reside
in the Tambo district until the date
of his untimely death in the year
1918, at the early age of 35.
During his lifetime he held the
Commission of the Peace, was for
eight years a member of the Tambo
Shire Council, and was always
actively to the fore in promoting the
numerous affairs instituted for the
advancement of the district wherein
he was born, and where his manly
qualities endeared him to a large
section of the community. He was
survived by his wife, two sons, and
one daughter. Of the other sons,

and Henry administers the Tambo
properties. The Messrs. Doyle Bros,
lend their support to all movements
set afoot for the benefit of the
district and to the local hospital and
institutions of a charitable nature,
and they are among the foremost to
afford their patronage to all branches
of clean sport. Mr. Peter Doyle is
a member of the Tambo Shire
Council, having been elected to the
seat rendered vacant by the death of
his elder brother. He is also a
member of the Tambo Marsupial
Board.
“STRATHFINELLA,” the pro-
perty of Messrs. Willcocks & Newell,
is a pastoral proposition well known
in the district lying west of Long-
reach, from which town it is distant
45 miles due west. It was purchased
from Mr. M. A. Douglas in the year
1916, and was originally part of
"Corona” Station, having been taken
up by the above-mentioned gentle-
man on a resumption of that estate,
and developed by him until its
disposal to the present owners. Some
20,000 odd acres comprise its area,
the country being particularly well
adapted to the production of clean
wool, the land being composed of a
light soil of chocolate nature and
pebbly downs timbered with gidya,
boree, whitewood, and mulga, and
bearing a heavy growth of Mitchell,
Flinders, and blue grasses, while in
the winter months a luxuriant
supply of herbage prevails. Wool
is the main product of the property,
some 10,000 sheep being usually
grazed on its acres, and a small herd
of good shorthorn cattle. The
estate has a fine frontage to
Catherine Creek and its branches,
the flats bordering this waterway
affording excellent pasturage for the
stock. The property is also well
watered, mainly from permanent
sources naturally conserved in sev-
eral deep holes in the bed of the
creek, a supplemental supply being
provided by two sub-artesian bores
and a well, the whole affording
ample provision for the stock in all
seasons. Since their acquirement of
the estate Messrs. Willcocks &
Newell have completed a large
amount of improvement work, one
of the bores above-mentioned having
been put down under their regime
and further subdivisions completed.
The run is enclosed with rabbit-
proof fencing, and is dog-proof,
making it one of the most desirable
and up-to-date concerns of its size in
the West. The homestead, which did
duty under previous ownership,
fulfills all the requirements of the
bachelor-manager and part owner of
“Strathfinella,” though it is unpre-
tentious when compared with many
of its more modern neighbours. Mr.
Robert James Willcocks is the
youngest son of the late George
Charles Willcocks, a well-known
railway contractor, whose pioneering
efforts in regard to the development
of railway construction in Queens-
land will cause his name to be long


remembered in this State. The
former gentleman was born on
December 23, 1892, and educated at
the Brisbane Grammar School and
in England. On entering man’s
estate he entered upon landed pur-
suits, having previously acquired
sufficient experience in the office of
Messrs. Rich & Co., Brisbane, to fit
him for the commercial and financial
side of pastoral administration. He
is at present occupied with the
conduct of “Strathfinella.” His
brother, Major G. C. Willcocks, is
a member of the medical profession,
who served with the A.1.F., and was
awarded the Military Cross for dis-
tinguished service in France during
the progress of the Great War. Mr.
William Graham Newell was born at
Herberton, Northern Queensland,
and educated at the Brisbane Gram-
mar School. He is a son of Mr. John
Newell, one of the principal pioneers
of Northern Queensland, and well
known through his association with
the foundation of Herberton. While
Mr. Willcocks is engaged in the
practical management of their joint
property, Mr. W. G. Newell is
occupied with commercial, mining,
and agriculture interests in different
parts of Northern Queensland. It
is worthy of record that" his only
brother served the colours as
a commissioned officer in the
artillery. Mr. Newell is married
to a daughter of Mr. Clarence
Smith, of “Boorook,” Tenterfield,
New South Wales, and has one son.
THOMAS SPENCE, “Rosedale,”
Longreach, was born at Tully Hill,
near Ballymena, County Antrim,
Ireland, on April 23, 1843. He is a
son of the late William Spence, a
member of an old Orkney family,
his forbears having peopled the
islands so named from time im-
memorial. The subject of our memoir
is also descended from a branch of
the O’Neill family, his progenitors
having been clansmen of the great
“O’Neill of the Red Hand.” One of
his more immediate ancestors, whose
earthly remains now lie in that
portion of God’s acre at Ahoghill
which marks the last resting place
of so many of the name, was a noted
yoeman of the period. His maternal
grandfather, Alexander Wright, was
a soldier, and served the Empire in
the Peninsular War for many years,
fighting later in the great battle
of Waterloo. The late William
Spence was well known in the North
of Ireland both through his associa-
tion with agrarian pursuits and his
efforts in fostering the linen industry
in that part of the country, his
commercial instincts recognizing the
possibilities of expansion in the
latter trade and being responsible
for his own interests in this direc-
tion, which were considerable, in-
cluding not only the culture of the
flax itself, but also its subsequent
manufacture and commerce. This
progressive industrialist was a man
of strong character, peaceful tem-
perament, and studious disposition,
his reading covered a wide field and
resulting in his being well informed
on most subjects of the day. Realiz-
ing the possibilities open to young
men of energy and perseverance in
newer lands under the protection of
the British flag he was not averse to
his sons striking out for themselves
in a distant part of the globe, and
consequently four young scions of his
race set out at different periods and
later contributed their share of
history-making in the great Contin-
ent of Australia. The gentleman
under leview, Mr. Thomas Spence,
was educated at the Irish National
School, concluding his scholastic
studies when at the age of 14 in
order to assist his father on the home
farm, where he obtained a useful
knowledge of the agrarian industry
and became proficient also in the
weaving trade while yet in his teens.
He remained thus under the super-
vision of his parent until the attain-
ment of his twentieth year, when in
response to an inherent love of
adventure he set the example which
was later followed by his three
brothers, leaving his birthplace to
try his fortunes abroad, in August,
1863. He embarked on the sailing
ship “Tartar,” a vessel commanded
by Captain Vincent, and well known
amongst the emigrant population
of Western Australia at that time,
and landed at the then open road-
stead of Fremantle, Western Aus-
tralia, on November 12, 1863. The
passengers included the well-beloved
cleric, Father Gibney, who later, as
Bishop of Perth, became prominently
identified with the history of the
Western State, the voyage resulting
in the formation of a friendship
between these two Irishmen of broad
minds and different faiths which
lasted for many years. At about
the same time he was fortunate in
meeting that great, broadminded,
and able statesman, the late Lord
Forrest, whose death occurred at
sea in 1918, and with whom he
also established a firm friend-
ship, the memory of which is
still kept green in the heart of the
old pioneer. Within three months
of his arrival in Australia he became
a trooper in the Mounted Police
Force, the interim being spent as
general hand on the station of Mrs.
Ramsay—an aunt of the late Lord
Forrest. For more than five years he
carried out the multifarious duties
incidental to his post, his work
taking him over various parts of
Western Australia, though it was
more particularly confined to the
district around Geraldton, where he
witnessed many stirring events
amongst the political convicts of the
time. During the above period he
married, and in the year 1869,
having decided that he was unsuited
to a lire of officialdom, and hoping to
carve for himself a more independent
career in the East, he resigned from
his position in the Mounted Police
in order to try his fortunes in
Victoria, where some of his wife’s
relatives were then residing. On
arriving in Melbourne he became
employed for a time on railway work,
but being attracted by the possibili-
ties of speedier success on the gold-
fields, he subsequently journeyed to
Bendigo with the intention of trying
his luck at that centre. He followed
the mining industry for a period
extending over three year's, being
later engaged in a variety of bush
occupations. In the late seventies
he undertook contracts for tank-
sinking in the Riverina district of
the Mother State, and from that
time forward was successfully
engaged in this calling, which he
pursued for nearly twenty years.
During the whole of that period he
conducted the business himself,
owning the complete outfit, which
included many bullock teams.
11 undreds of men were also employed
by him at different times, and he
was eventually known as one of the
most successful tank-sinking contrac-
tors in the Continent. His work from
its starting point in the Riverina
district took him eastward, west-
ward, and northward through var-
ious parts of New South Wales, and
eventually into Queensland, where
his career as a contractor subse-
quently ended, his final agreement
in this connection being carried out


in the year 1894, when he completed
the excavation of 150,000 yards at
“Portland Downs,” a station situ-
ated in the vicinity of Isisford.
While occupied with the above-men-
tioned contract he selected the block
whereon at time of writing he
still resides, this land having been
originally part of the resumption
of “Wellshot” Station. At the latter
end of the year 1894, having con-
cluded the work on “Portland
Downs,” he proceeded with his
family to the newly acquired
property, which he named “Rose-
dale,” and assisted by his sons—who
had then reached man’s estate—at
once set himself to the task of build-
ing a permanent home, at the same
time entering upon other necessary
development. As a result of their
steady industry and persevering
labours the 30,000 acres comprising
“Rosedale” became recognized as one
of the representative new properties
of the Longreach district after a
brief number of years. The original
drawback of the estate was a scarcity
of water, but this deficiency was
overcome in the early stages of
development, a splendid artificial
supply being provided by the
initiation of a system of circular
tanks, these being excavated and
banked up in those portions of the
run considered most convenient for
serving the stock. The herd of 500
head of cattle with which he
depastured the property being thus
insured against all danger of a water
shortage, Mr. Spence next turned
his attention to the fencing and
subdivision of the run into the
requisite number of paddocks. As
an example of his energetic methods
of administration we may mention
that within three years of his
occupation of “Rosedale” these and
other developments were completed,
and a flock of 11,000 ©wee purchased
from “Bowen Downs” Station, and
flock rams from “Retro,” in the
Clermont district, were introduced,
the cattle being then disposed of.
From this foundation the home flock
has been bred, and his subsequently
acquired properties have been pro-
vided with woollies, as occasion
demanded. Success having attended
his first venture, it was not long
before he embarked upon another
proposition, purchasing “Wood-
lands,” in the vicinity of Jundah,
in the year 1897. This property is
at time of writing conducted by his
second son, Mr. Thomas Alexander
Spence, and embraces some 50,000
acres of country, which are devoted
bo horned stock, 1,000 head of mixed
cattle, mainly of the shorthorn type,
being carried, and in addition the
requisite number of horses for
station purposes. “Woodlands” was
found to be unsuitable for sheep-
raising owing to the depredations of
the dingoes which abound in that
locality. In 1899, two years after
the acquirement of the last-men-
tioned property, “Culloden” Sta-
tion, an estate situated in the
vicinity of Muttaburra, was pur-
chased for the sum of £30,000. It
is at present conducted under the
administration of the eldest eon, Mr,
William James Spence, as a mixed
sheep and cattle proposition, the
Herefords bred at “Culloden” having
a reputation for purity of breed,
conformation, and quality equal to
that of any herd of its size in
Queensland. The sheep which are
pastured on the property number
30,000, these being pure merinos and
of the same type as the flocks pastur-
ing on “Rosedale” and the more
recently acquired “Maromba” acres.
The quality of the wool grown at
“Culloden” is evidenced in the fact
that it yielded 26|d. during the first
Queensland wool appraisement of
1918, having com© second in
point of price. In the year
1910 Mr. Spence added to his landed
interests by the purchase of
“Dillalah,” a station situated near
Charleville, which he later disposed
of to the Queensland Government.
His fourth property, “Maromba,”
is in charge of his third son, Robert
John Spence. The four estates carry
approximately some 30,000 sheep,
1,500 head of cattle, and 350 horses.
They are all well-developed proper-
ties, “Culloden” having in addition
to other improvements two artesian
bores. This run has also been
provided with dams and overshot
dams, to supplement the supply
afforded by the natural and other
conserved waters of several creeks.
“Maromba” is also well provided for
in the matter of water conservation,
having two bores, and being
otherwise similarly supplied to
“Culloden,” both in regard to
natural and artificial sources.
“Woodlands” is watered chiefly by
wells, though a fair number of dams
are included in the scheme of its
development. As already mentioned,
tanks form the main source of supply
at the home station, further
provision having been made for the
stock on “Rosedale” by the later
excavation of dams. The founder
of the family in Queensland is still
the advising head, and the wide
experience of the old pioneer is
successfully backed up by the indus-
triously acquired knowledge and
practical efforts of his capable young
sons, the result of the energy and
perseverance of both father and sons
being apparent in their present well-
merited success. Mr. Thomas Spence
married in the year 1866 Mary,
daughter of the late James Egan,
County Clare, Ireland, a descendant
of on© of the old South of Ireland
families of that name. Many of the
Egans have taken prominent part in
the local Government of Munster.
To Mrs. Spence must be accorded
due credit for her share in the
pioneering work accomplished by her
husband. She faced with him the
many hardships, difficulties, and
sacrifices which, in earlier times, so
often and so sorely tried their united
endurance, giving the touch of home
to the primitive abodes which are
now but memories, and smoothing so
far as in her lay, by unfailing
encouragement, the uphill path of
the pioneer. Flood, fire, and
drought were among the hardships
which threatened them in their turn.
On on© occasion, during the calamit-
ous flood of 1893, she with her
husband and twelve children were
obliged to take refuge from the
rapidly-rising water on the roof of a
temporary bough shed. For two
days they remained there, during
which their lives were in constant
and imminent danger. Their priva-
tions and sufferings on this occasion
may be more easily imagined than
described, and resulted in the later
severe and long illness of several
members of the family. The episode
occurred at Wild Horse Creek, and
amongst its other consequences were
the total loss of their household
provisions and domestic animals, the
latter being all drowned. Mr. and
Mrs. Spence have a surviving family
of four sons and seven daughters.
Six of the latter are married, five to
local graziers, and one to Mr. J.
Flowers, an officer of the Bank of
New South Wales at Clermont, who
is also interested with his brothers in
the pastoral industry. The fourth
son, Joseph, whose name we have
hitherto failed to mention in our
memoir, is engaged in pastoral
pursuits on his own account in the
Longreach district. His property
adjoins r ‘Rosedale,” and is called
“Glen Thompson.”


ROBERT TELFORD, J.P.,
“Withywine,” Longreach, is a son
of the late Gideon Telford, having
been born on February 18, 1868, at
“Peechelba” Station, Victoria, a
property situated on the Ovens
River near to where it junctions
with the Murray, and which was
owned at that time by Messrs,
McPherson, Rutherford, & Telford.
The last-mentioned gentleman was
the paternal grandfather of the
subject of our memoir and the
founder of the branch of the Telford
immemorial. For about fifteen years
subsequent to his arrival in the land
of the Southern Cross he filled the
position above described, relinquish-
ing his appointment at the termina-
tion of that period in order to enter
the pastoral industry on his own
account, securing “Peechelba” in
partnership with Mr. John Ruther-
ford and Mr. Ewan McPherson, all
three gentlemen becoming later well
known in the pastoral history
of Victoria. In addition to “Peech-
elba” they owned “Yarrawonga,”
Ned Kelly). “Yarrawonga was
subsequently individually owned by
the late Robert Telford, whose death
occurred on that station. He joined
the Great Majority in the year 1886,
having attained the ripe old age of
eighty-eight years, at the close of a
lifetime marked by many an eventful
incident and replete with experiences
of pastoral life and its earlier
conditions, the story of which
provides an example by which newer
generations may benefit. His mem-
ory will be long recalled in that
family which is represented at
“Withy wine,” having arrived in
the Wimmera district, Victoria, in
the year 1840, in order to undertake
on behalf of the then Duke of
Sutherland the duties of overseer of
the Australian pastoral properties
in which the noble gentleman was
interested. That pioneer of worthy
memory, the late Robert Tel-
ford, hailed from Sutherlandshire,
Scotland, though his immediate and
distant ancestors had their homes in
the Lowlands, where the family tree
had been in existence from time
A MOB OF SHEEP IN YARDS.
“Cobram,” and “Ulupna” Stations,
the first-named being the scene of the
death of the notorious bushranger,
Morgan, who was shot by a station
hand named Quinlan in April 1865,
after the former had had the
“Peechelba” folk bailed up all night.
(The late Robert Telford’s grandson,
the subject of this review and part
owner of “Withywine,” has youthful
reminiscences of those sometimes
tragically exciting days, having
witnessed the capture of the most
notorious of all the Australian
bushrangers, the outlaw known as
portion of Australia with which he
was more particularly associated
during his earthly career. He left a
family of four sons and three
daughters, and of the former,
Gideon, the father of the present
Robert Telford, was the second
eldest. On his attainment to man’s
estate the late Gideon Telford
entered into partnership with his
parent in the ownership of “Yarra-
wonga,” and on the subsequent
disposal of the property on the
latter’s decease he re-acquired by
purchase from the State a portion


of the country which comprised its
area, conducting the industry on
this estate until 1917, in which year
he also crossed the Great Divide. A
family of three sons and two

daughters survive him, of whom the
managing partner of “Withywine”
is the eldest. The remaining sons
joined the A.1.F., and proceeding
to the front fought valiantly in
defence of the Empire and the
Allied Nations. Sergeant-major
George Telford, the youngest son of
the late Gideon Telford, met a
soldier’s death at the battle of
Pozieres, whilst the second son was
discharged from service owing to a
physical disablement ere reaching
the firing line. Mr. Robert Telford
received his education at Beechworth,
Victoria, and under private tuition.
In his early teens he was associated
with his father in the work and
administration of the paternal acres,
starting life on his own account late
in his twentieth year. His first
position was as a jackaroo on
“Boomanoomana” Station, in the
Riverina district, where he remained
for a couple of years, relinquishing
his post in the year 1890 in order to
take charge of a number of stud
sheep destined for "Ambo” Station,
near Muttaburra, Queensland, for
the firm of Messrs. Eyre, Parsons, &
Newton, these animals being the
first Vermont merinos imported to
the Central portion of the Queen
State. He remained at “Ambo” for
six months, at the end of which time
he was offered and accepted the
management of “Yamburra,” a
station situated on the Thomson
River. For the following fifteen
years he was occupied with the
administration of the last-mentioned
estate, severing his long connection
therewith in the year 1906, having
decided to enter the pastoral
industry on his own behalf. With
this end in view he had purchased a
property called “Cleeve,” situated
near Longreach, and entered upon
the personal conduct of its acres in
the year already mentioned. After
working “Cleeve” for a period of six
years he disposed of it to the present
owner, purchasing “Withywine,” in
1912. This property was disposed of
in the following year and re-acquired
in 1916 in conjunction with Mr.
J. W. Dowling, formerly of “Oak-
wood” Station, in the Charleville
district. Mr. Dowling, who now lives
in retirement in Melbourne, while
the younger and more active partner
administers affairs at “Withywine,”
is a member of the Dowling family
of “Jellalabad” Station, Western
District of Victoria, well known
through its association with the
foundation of the pastoral industry
in the Garden State. “Withywine”
embraces some 75,000 acres of
country, mainly of flat formation,
though the monotony is broken here
and there by occasional ridges,
some of which are timbered with
gidya and others by bloodwood and
dead finish, these trees forming
valuable shelter for the stock. The
run is clothed chiefly with Mitchell
grass, though lighter varieties flour-
ish in greater profusion on the ridges.
Some 20,000 sheep are depastured
on the property, which is exclusively
devoted to woollies of “Wanganella”
blood, this famous strain being
particularly evident in the “Withy-
wine” flock. The requisite number
of horses and a small herd of cattle
to provide for station requirements
are also carried. The run is highly
developed, the improvements includ-
ing five sub-artesian bores and a
number of surface dams which
provide an ample water supply. The
structural improvements are also up-
to-date and extremely efficient, over
80 miles of fencing having been
erected in the subdivision of the
property into eleven paddocks, the
boundary having been safeguarded
by marsupial and dog-proof netting.
The homestead is situated some 70
miles south of Longreach, which is
the nearest centre of railway com-
munication. Since his advent to
Western Queensland Mr. Telford
has been particularly prominent in
all affairs tending to the advance-
ment of the district or the welfare of
the community. For over seventeen
years he has been a member of the
Longreach Council, of which body
he is now deputy chairman. He is
the present chairman of committees
in connection with the local Show
Society, having been a committee-
man and actively connected with
that association since its inception.
For two years he filled the office of
vice-president of the Longreach
Club, of which he is one of the
founders, and during the year 1918
his active exertions on its committee
were recognized by contemporary
members, who did him the honour
of electing him to the presidentship.
He has exercised a Commission of
the Peace since 1893, in which year
he was gazetted under the Nelson
Administration. Before his final
acquirement in partnership of
“Withywine,” and for some time
afterwards, Mr. Telford spent a
TROOPER G. R. TELFORD.
number of years in organizing and
managing the Longreaeh branch of
the Queensland Pastoralists’ Associa-
tion, but owing to the pressure
of business connected with his


individual interests he was obliged to
relinquish the work to which he had
applied himself so arduously and
successfully. He is a sincere advo-
cate of clean sport, being an active
member of the committee of
the Longreach Amateur Race
Club and one of the founders
of that body. As a keen judge of
racing matters he was requested to
fulfil the functions of honorary
handicapper several years ago, and
has since performed these duties for
the club at their different meetings.
Indeed, there is no movement of a
public, patriotic, or charitable
nature in which he does not take a
leading part. He married in 1897
Maud, daughter of Mr. John Barry
Gill, an old identity of the Central
West of Queensland, who hailed
from Victoria to the Queen State
about forty years ago, and has been
well known as a contractor for
station developmental operations for
nearly half a century. Of the union
there is a family of five sons and
five daughters. Of the former the
two eldest, Gideon Barry and
Lindsay Sutton, though yet in their
teens, followed the example set by
their paternal uncles in joining the
Australian Imperial Forces. Both saw
active service and fought gallantly in
the endeavour to uphold the honour
of the Empire mid the harsh and
unaccustomed scenes at the Great
War theatre, glad in the knowledge
that they were doing a "man’s duty
in a man’s way.”
RAYMOND HOUGH LOGAN,
of "Fairfield,” "Cressy” and
“Lambton Meadows” Stations, Cen-
tral Queensland, and formerly of
"Beaufort,” near Pine Hill, on the
MR. R. H. LOGAN.
Queensland Central Railway line, is
the eldest son of Mr. George Logan,
owner of "Pine View,” near Kilcoy,
and other large pastoral properties.
A memoir of the .career of Mr.
George Logan appears on page 274,
Vol. I. of this work. The gentleman
under review was born on the old
"Brookfield” Farm, which occupied
a site on the northern side of the
Brisbane River, and comprised an
area of 2,000 acres, a portion of
which still remains in the possession
of Mr. Logan, sen. After a primary
course of education at the Goodna
State School, Mr. Raymond Logan
attended for a time the Christian
Brothers’ College at Ipswich, com-
pleting his scholastic career at the
Boys’ Central School, Brisbane.
Leaving the lastmentioned institu-
tion in his fifteenth year, he took up
his residence on "Pine View” Sta-
tion, and assumed an active part in
the management of the property,
from the outset proving a valued
assistant to his father, who was
personally engaged in the adminis-
tration of the run. He displayed
much aptitude in respect to the
carrying out of the numer-
ous improvements inaugurated by
Mr. George Logan on this large
grazing area, where many of the
stockyards and fences in existence
at the present day are the result
of his personal exertion. The
excellence of the construction of this
and other work undertaken by him
speaks volumes for the enthusiasm
and capability brought to bear on his
special department by Mr. Raymond
Logan, who, it plainly may be seen,
grudged neither time nor trouble to
achieve the standard which he had
set for himself at the beginning. He
remained at "Pine View” until 23
years of age, and during this period
made the most of the close associa-
tion with his father into which he

was brought in the management and
handling of stock, the older man
long before having gained a well-
deserved reputation for his expert
knowledge of both horned and
equine stock. It will be gathered
that the experience of both father
and son was gained under most stren-
uous conditions, the nature of which
can only be fully appreciated by
those who have personally faced and
overcome the difficulties of landed
enterprise. As in the case with the
former, a capacity for hard work and
the faculty of seeing ahead and of
grasping right opportunities, were
the determining factors towards the
eventual success of the latter, and
resulted in his acquirement when a
young man of small lots of cattle,
as good investments were presented.
He thus formed the nucleus of a
small herd of his own, which he pas-
tured on the home property. Hav-
ing, ere Ire passed his majority by a
couple of years, strengthened the
foundations both of necessary know-
ledge and material prosperity, Mr.
Logan in Iris early twenties realized
the advisableness of making a for-
ward move on his own account, and
his desire was met by his father with
the proposal of a partnership, to
which he readily acceded. His herd
having considerably incieased, and
the "Pine View’' pastures being by
this time somewhat overstocked, an
arrangement was made by which
MR. J. POWNALL.
Mr. Logan, sen., took over his son’s
cattle, and each member of the
newly-formed firm invested an equal
sum in the purchase of 1,100 head
from Mr. A. J. Cotton, who at that
time owned “Bauhinia Downs,” in
the Springsure district, where the
mob was pastured. These were
placed on ‘'Planet Downs” Station,
acquired about the same time by the
Logans from Mr. Brock Hollinshed,
the former owner, who on account of
the loss of all his stock from the
effects of the big drought of 1902,
was considering the abandonment ol
the property. Mr. Raymond Logan,
who was undertaking the manage-
ment of the new proposition, having
brought his cattle from “Bauhinia
Downs,” started in 1904 on the
practical work of administration,
the vigour and energy which
had marked his endeavours on
the parental property now being
brought to bear with the best results
on the development of “Planet
Downs.” The signal success which
attended his efforts whilst working
on a comparatively small scale gave
him an insight into what might be
effected if a larger area of land
were secured by the firm, and he
suggested to his father the scheme of
taking up the “Beaufort” run, in the
South Kennedy district, a big lease-
hold which had been relinquished

on account of the drought by
the representatives of the late Sir
Arthur Palmer, the original holder.
Mr. George Logan, being convinced
of the soundness of judgment pos-
sessed by his son, and his ability to
carry to a successful conclusion what
he chose to undertake, approved the
suggestion, and forthwith securing
the territory, they partly stocked it
from “Maggieville,” a property held
by Mr. Logan, sen., in conjunction
with his son George. Subsequently
another mob of 2,000 breeders was
brought from "Saxby Downs,” and
it is interesting to note in this con-
nection that whereas the cost of the
cattle originally obtained by the
firm for stocking up “Beaufort”
averaged £3 10s. per head, delivered
on the property, within a decade
the same class of stock had risen in
price to £lO per head. In 1906 a
manager was appointed to take
charge of the run, which continued
under the same administration
until 1908, when Mr. Raymond
Logan disposed of his interest in
"Planet Downs” to his father, and
took over the latter gentleman’s
share in the South Kennedy district
property, entering once more on the
personal control of its operations.
"Beaufort” Station is situated
about 260 miles west of Rockhamp-
ton, on the Central railway line,
which runs right through the pro-
perty. It covers considerably over
600 square miles of good pastoral
country, undulating in character,
and watered by the Belyando River
and numerous wells and bores, and it
is well clothed with natural grasses,
in addition to which there is plenty
of edible scrub, the latter forming
a big asset in country subject to the
ravages of occasional drought. As
already stated, it was taken up in
the first instance by the late Sir
Arthur Palmer, an ex-Premier of
the State, who also held the port-
folios of Colonial Secretary and
Secretary for Public Instruction in
the Mcllwraith Ministry of 1879-
1882. When the Logans (father and
son) succeeded Sir Arthur as pro-
prietors of what may be termed one
of the historic stations of Queens-
land, the lease was taken out in Mr.
Georee Logan’s name, but notwith-
standing this circumstance, in view
of the fact that the younger man
assumed from the first the whole
responsibility of the venture, and
eventually entered into sole posses-
sion, it may be broadly said that


“'Beaufort” had known but two
owners up to the date of its sale
in 1919. It was used by Sir
Arthur Palmer principally for
sheep, as many as 80,000 having
been depastured there at one time,
and Mr. Logan, although pre-emi-
nently a cattle man, followed to
some extent in the footsteps of his
predecesssor, and gave a con-
siderable share of his attention to
sheep-raising. At one time, in the
early stages of his enterprises, he
grazed a flock of 28,000 sheep upon
the “Beaufort” pastures, but hav-
ing proved the country on the
whole more suitable for cattle, by
degrees he disposed of the sheep to
make room for the larger stock. At
other periods he also' engaged in
various sheep ventures, with
highly successful results. “Beaufort”
carried under his regime about
27,000 head of mixed cattle,
among which the shorthorn strain
predominated. Here Mr. Logan
owned two fine shorthorn bulls,
“Yandilla Charming York,” a
roan, bred by Mr. J. R. Lomax;
and "Lyndhurst Duke of Derrimut
4th” (calved January, 1915), bred
by Mr. C. E. McDougall at his
“Lyndhurst” Stud. “Yandilla
Cha.rming York” (calved September
17, 1915) was sired by “Charming
Duke 28th,” by “Abbotsford Duke”
(imp.) (85126), and is out of

at auction as yearling for 525 gns.) ;

“Gladstone” (imp.); g.g.g.g.g.,
“Sophy,” by “Sir Theodore,” by
“Theodore” (imp.); g-g-g-g-g-g-,
“Sophia,” by “Comet” (imp.). He
bred all his own stock horses, of
which there were from 200 to 300
on “Beaufort” in his day, those
not required for the uses of the
station being sent to the local
markets, where they commanded a
ready sale. Some fine sires have been
owned by him, though probably none
have surpassed in quality, “Flash of
Steel” (imp.), a splendid animal
which now does service on “Cressy”
and “Fairfield,” properties more
recently acquired. “Flash of Steel”
was bred in England by Mr. R.
Croker and imported to Australia by
Messrs. Robinson & Clark. He has
had a brilliant racing career, among
the events in which he has notably
distinguished himself being the
V.A.T.C. Futurity Stakes of £l,BOO,
which he won in 1 min. 27 secs.; the
Woodcliff Handicap and the Moor-
field R.C. Rockdale Mile, in all his
performances commanding attention
for his evidence of quality, tempera-
ment and vigour. His ancestry for
several generations shows a fine list
of performances in England, where
stock produced by his sire, “Orby,”
realize prices ranging to 2,000
guineas. The “Beaufort” area was
considerably improved by Mr. Logan
who holds definite views in regard
to the necessity of proper develop-
ment on the land in order to obtain
the best results. Considerable
attention was devoted to the arrange-
ments for water supply under his
regime and he had the various wells
and bores fitted in the most uo-to-
date manner, while the same progres-
sive spirit was responsible for various
other improvements. In addition to
“Fairfield” and “Cressy,” Mr.
Logan owns “Lambton Meadows,” a
property of some 75,000 acres, situ-
ated near Alpha, on the Great
Dividing Range; a one-sixth share in
"Cresswell Downs,” a Northern Ter-
ritory holding; and a quarter share
in “Lissadell” Station, in Western
Australia. Formerly “Lambton
Meadows” was used for sheep, but
owing to the ravages of the fly, and

the native dog trouble, coupled with
the high prices of sheep, it was con-
sidered advisable to dispose of the
flock, and this was done early in
1917. “Lambton Meadows” em-
braces 56,000 acres of “desert”
country—so called in pioneering
days before water development and
conservation had converted what was
previously regarded as useless conn-
try for stock into most desirable pas-
toral holdings that usually carry in
addition to grass crops large quan-
tities of natural edible scrub and
herbage which have proved their
value during the worst droughts,
This run is used as relief country for
the stock of “Cressy” and “Fairfield”


in drought times. “Fairfield”
was purchased in October of the
year 1919, and consists of 30,000
acres which are held in blocks hav-
ing an acreage of 10,000. These
three blocks are highly developed
both in regard to structural improve-
ments and artificial water supplies,
the fencing enclosing fourteen pad-
docks and, with the boundary erec-
tions, running to twenty-eight miles.
The “Fairfield” country is watered
by a flowing bore that produces
100,000 gallons per diem and supple-
ments a splendid natural supply from
the Thomson River, to which the
run has a good frontage about eight-
teen miles north of Longreach. It is
devoted to sheep, for which its carry-
ing capacity for the whole year
round is estimated at 20,000. Com-
prised of 100,000 acres of magnifi-
cent downs country carrying suffi-
cient timber to make excellent
shelter for the woollies, “Cressy,”
which is situated forty miles from
Stamford on the Winton-Hughenden
line, is one of the most desirable runs
of the Central West. It has already
received considerable attention in
the way of development, carrying
many bores and wells that are fitted
with powerful mills. On this pro-
perty water has been secured at
depths of 18 and 25 ft., and one
of the bores goes down 3,000 feet,
the other bores and wells ranging
in depth to 300 ft. “Cressy,” which
is made up of six selections and has
about sixteen years’ lease to run, will
be capable of carrying 60,000 sheep
when the development already
inaugurated is completed, the flock
depastured at the present time com-
prising a strength of 56,000. Mr.
Logan’s landed interests include
“Lyndor,” his Brisbane home on
Windermere Road, Ascot, a picture
of which is reproduced in these pages,
and a seaside home at Yeppoon, near
Rockhampton. Like the majority of
successful pastoralists he has experi-
enced various “ups and downs,”
fought troubles and difficulties
brought by floods and droughts and
shouldered all adversities with the
fortitude characteristic of his class.
Through heavy speculation in stock
immediately preceding the phenom-
enal fall in sheep and cattle values
in 1921, he suffered severe financial
losses, to which were added a big
reverse in January of the following
year as a result of flood, the district
in which his Central Western pro-
perties are situated having then ex-
perienced a rainfall of 26 inches in
the same number of hours and a rise
of nine feet in the river in about the
same number of minutes, the result
to Mr. Logan being the loss of
13,000 woolly sheep. In the year
1908, he married Agnes Elinor,
youngest daughter of the late John
Pownall, who left England for Aus-
tralia in the year 1864, and subse-
quently was numbered among the
early settlers of the Logan district,
where he was engaged in farming

and grazing pursuits until the time
of his death, which occurred in the
early eighties. Mr. and Mrs. Ray-
mond Logan have a family of three
eons and one daughter.

THOMAS PURCELL, J.P.,
"Galway Downs,” via Jundah, West
Queensland, was born in the village
of Coolkell, near Thurless, in the
County of Tipperary, Ireland, in the
late forties. He is a son of
the late James Purcell, a member of
one of the oldest agrarian families
in Ireland, his forbears for many
generations past having occupied
their own landed holdings in the
Emerald Isle, where they carried on
farming pursuits on their own
account. Among the various repre-
sentatives of the family line have
been outstanding examples of men
so imbued with patriotic spirit that
they have been willing to give their
lives in defence of the liberty so dear
to the heart of the Celt, and others
who were distinguished for the
prominent place they took in those
movements initiated a century ago,
the aim and object of which were to
improve the country of their birth.
The gentleman under review accom-
panied his father and mother to
Australia, when the worthy couple,
with their five sons and one
daughter, emigrated from Ireland
by the sailing vessel, “The Duchess
of Northumberland,” in the early
fifties, in due course arriving at their
destination, New South Wales, a few

tralia, but for a short period Mr.
Thomas Purcell enjoyed the advan-
tage of instruction in a small school

South Wales, and subsequently was
accustomed to study in the evening
at home under the guidance of a
tutor, in this way acquiring the
father and sons obtained employment
in shepherding, a practice which
was necessarily resorted to by the
sheep farmers before the days of
fencing runs had been ushered in.
The younger members of the family
soon became quite proficient in this
work, and before he had reached 10
years of age Mr. Purcell was shep-
herding a flock of sheep on his own
responsibility in the Goulburn dis-
trict for the late John Chisholm, a
member of the pioneering family by
that name, well known throughout
New South Wales. Industry and
frugality were practised by the
Purcell household, and as a result
of this policy the late James Purcell
was able to avail himself of an
opportunity to purchase a farm of
modest acreage, where he resided
during the brief remainder of a
worthy life, having successfully
founded his name and line in the
new and promising country under
the Southern Cross. He died before
completing the full tenure of his
years, after less than a decade in the
land of his adoption, which was to
prove itself a kindly nurturer of the
fortune of his race in the future.
The subject of this memoir, Mr.
Thomas Purcell, when only 15 years
of age, prepared to strike out for
years before the separation of
Queensland from the Mother Colony.
Schools for the education of the
young were practically non-existent

side work for all, however, was the
order of the day, and only a short
time had elapsed after their arrival
in the new country before both

thoroughly possessed with the spirit
of the bush determined to turn his
hand to whatever avocations offered
in the direction of station life.


Accordingly lie soon found abundant
occupation for his energies in fenc-
ing, clearing, ringbarking, dam
sinking, and also became experienced
in the practical routine of every
branch of work among the stock,

that before long he was able to place
a second team on the road following
up the routes between New South
Wales and Victoria, and doing
considerable business with the big
station homesteads. His operations

assurances of those who possessed a
first-hand knowledge of the subject,
came to Queensland to test for
himself the alleged boundless possi-
bilities of the northern country,
After spending a considerable
knowledge in the handling of sheep,
cattle, and horses which in after
years proved of the greatest possible
benefit to him and materially
assisted him in achieving the success
which has been the reward of his
earlier and later enterprise. Having
been brought up to frugal and
industrious habits, he continued
therein, and patiently awaiting the
opportunity which is said to come
to all who look for it, husbanded his
slender resources with care, until

continuing to prosper, the possibility
of land selection began to dawn over
his horizon, and before long he was
enrolled among the property-holders
of New South Wales, his selection
being situated near Forbes. Stock-
ing the paddocks with a flock of
1,000 ewes he began breeding up
from this nucleus, also doing a little
dealing from time to time to increase
more rapidly the numbers of his
stock. In this department again
success attended his ventures, and
amount of time in looking round for
a holding suited to this purpose Mr.
Purcell finally decided to purchase
“Manilla,” a block of unstocked
country in the vicinity of Windorah.
This area he stocked lightly with
sheep and cattle, but at that period
the conditions of the wool markets
were so unsatisfactory that he found
himself with a two-years’ clip on his
hands at the station, and in such a
position, that even by offering it as
a gift he could not get it carried
before he had emerged from his
teene he had accumulated sufficient
capital wherewith to purchase a
team of horses for the purpose of
entering the carrying trade. He sue-
cessfully established himself as a car-
ricr in the western districts, and his

it was not long before he found that
the acreage of his holding was all too
limited for his rapidly expanding
interests. In the early eighties,
therefore, he uprooted all his asso-
ciations with .the parent Colony,
disposing of land and stock, and
away to the market. As this experi-
ence repeated itself, after some years,
failure stared him in the face, and
lie was forced to proceed to Brisbane
and borrow sufficient funds on the
security of his wool to buy a couple
of teams. The experience of his


younger days coming to Iris aid, and
with these teams he carted his wool
to the nearest railway station—

upon his return took a load of

station was finding a market, the
township of Windorah alone proving
able to consume all the fat sheep
he could supply. His country,

visitation of drought followed on the
years of plenty, and whilst his
neighbours were in sore straits,

however, was practically unwatered,
and fearing the descent of drought
which should find him unprepared
he made a wise outlay of his savings
in improvements in the direction of
water conservation. This precaution,

the whole of the flock intact. Other
owners, who had been inclined to
think that Mr. Purcell was wasting
money upon his water supply
schemes, were forced to throw up

the surrounding landholders, who
trusted to a continuance of the good
rainfall with which the district had
been blest through a cycle of seasons,

ing 100,000 sheep, his flock having
been increased from a tenth of this

elapsed since the drought as a direct
result of his system of dealing and
breeding up on scientific lines.
Subsequently Mr. Purcell purchased
“Galway Downs,” an adjoining run,
from the Union Bank, and removed
his place of residence to the newer
property, making of “Manilla” an
outstation for “Galway Downs.” In

situated some 200 miles from
Winton, on the Diamantina River,
was the signal for a plunge into
the cattle industry. “Davenport
Downs,” which was used for cattle
exclusively, at the time of purchase
was overstocked, and in order to
provide sufficient pastures for the
surplus of the herd Mr. Purcell sold
the sheep on “Galway Downs” and
brought from his Diamantina run a
big draft of about 10,000 cattle,
which he introduced to the “Galway”
pastures. As a result of this expert-
ment, which proved entirely satis-
factory, the latter property has been
converted into a cattle proposition
solely, and Mr. Purcell devotes his
personal attention at the time of
writing to the management of the
combined operations of his various
estates. The area of “Davenport
Downs,” of which “Ingle Downs”
forms a part, is 3,027 square miles;
whilst “Galway Downs,” “Manilla,”
and the other holdings allied with
these, cover about 2,500 square
miles, the whole carrying in ordin-
ary seasons, some 25,000 bead of
well-balanced shorthorn cattle, form-
ing a first-class herd, which has estab-
lished Mr. Purcell’s reputation as a
cattle breeder all over Queensland,
In addition about 1,000 head of
horses are run on the stations, the
types bred being heavy draughts, and
the sires used of the best blood
obtainable for the purpose required.
Practically all the horses for use on
the properties are drawn from the
station mob, but there is always a
large surplus, which finds its way to
the markets. In addition to the
interests already outlined Mr. Pur-
cell and his family are largely inter-
ested in a foundry and engineering
works established m >yc ney
under the title of . owe 0.,
mainly for the manufacture o
engines, boilers, motors, and like
machinery, which during tie war
was successfully engaged in tle
making of shells for military pur
poses. Mr. Purcell is a keen stuc ent
of political economy and has gone
through the world with his eyes wi e
open, acquiring a sound knowledge
of men and things, whilst he aso

branch of the Bowly family

MR. C. W. BOWLY.
by the 'personnel of the above-named
firm is Mr. CHARLES WILLIAM
BOWLY, of “Waramea,” Quirindi,
New South Wales. Hailing from
Cirencester, Gloucestershire, in
which portion of the Motherland his
progenitors had settled some
generations before, he arrived in
Australia in the early seventies,
being drawn hither by the pastoral
potentialities of Queensland. His
initial acquaintance with stock
and station work in his adopted
country was gained as a jackaroo on
“Lammermoor,” a holding in the
northernmost part of the Mitchell
district, and then owned by the
Christison family. Subsequently
he was employed on “Mount
Cornish” Station, where he had the
benefit of the wide pastoral
experience and expert knowledge of
the industry which were the
possession of that well-known
pioneer, the late E. R. Edkins. He
remained at "Mount Cornish” for
several years, and eventually
purchased “Eastmere,” a pastoral
area in the vicinity of Jericho,
which he carried on as a cattle
station until finally disposing of it
to the Whittingham family. In the
late nineties he retired from active
association with the industry and
made his home in the Mother State,
where, with his wife, he has since re-
sided. He married Alice, daughter
of the late William Keith King,
formerly of “Kingsley,” Langford,
Tasmania. Mr. King was a member
of a very old Tasmanian family
which figured prominently in the
commercial life of Launceston. Of
the union there is a surviving family
of five sons and two daughters, three
of the sons being at the time of
writing engaged in pastoral pursuits,
while another is a contractor for
artesian boring and now resident in
Western Queensland. Four of the
sons volunteered for active service
during the Great War, among these
being Messrs. F. W. and E. H.
Bowly of “Donald Downs” and
“Kalkadoon,” and Mr. Charles E.
MR. F. W. BOWLY.
Bowly, the eldest of the' family, a
well-known Brisbane man and a
member of the firm of Kennedy,
Bowly, & Manson, public
accountants, who, when his applica-
tion for service abroad was rejected
by the military authorities, became
secretary for the Queensland
Patriotic Fund. Messrs. Francis
William and Eustace, Hamilton
Bowly were both born at “Eastmere’’
Station, the elder on August 23,
1886, and the latter November 28
1889. Educated at the Boys’ High
School, Maitland, Mr. F. W. Bowly
gained his early pastoral experience
in New South Wales, and
subsequently followed the industry
in various parts o f that State and of
Queensland. For a number of years
he was engaged in wool-classing and
stud work, eventually taking up
“Kalkadoon” in the year 1914,
which he continued to develop until
his enlistment with the A.I.F. in
1916. He was in the thick of opera-
tions on the Eastern Front, in
Palestine, until the termination
of hostilities, when, returning to
Australia, he resumed his connection
with the pastoral industry on
“Kalkadoon.” He mairied in the
year 1920 Olga Sutcliffe, only
daughter of Mr. Cameron Sutcliffe
Rountree, a well-known merchant
of Quirindi, New South Wales. Mr.
E. H. Bowly was educated at the
Church of England Grammar School
(now the North Sydney Grammar
School), and on terminating his
studies there joined the Celebes Trad-
ing Co., a well-known pearling firm.
In the year 1916 he also joined the
colours and served in Palestine until
the end of the war. On their return to
Australia, the Messrs. Bowly entered
into partnership and established the
firm of Bowly Bros., and in 1920
added to their interests by the
purchase of “Donald Downs.”

ROBERT RAMSEY CALD-
WELL, “Happy Valley,” Winton,
was born at “Crosbie Mains,’’ in the
parish of West Kilbride, Ayrshire,
Scotland, and is the son of the late
MR. R. R. CALDWELL, SEN.
James Caldwell. “Crosbie Mains”
is an old home near Crosbie Castle,
which sheltered many generations of
the Caldwells whose interests were
chiefly confined to agriculture,
MR. R. R. CALDWELL.
though more than one child grew up
beneath its roof who in after life
made prominent the family name in
the field of politics, supporting,
according to individual view, either
Liberal or Tory Party during
different eras of British Parliament-
ary history. A Caldwell, from
whom the gentleman under review
is directly descended, was a sea
captain in charge of transports to
the Crimea during the war 1854-6,
and while engaged in this service
contracted and died of cholera.
Most of his maternal progenitors of
whom records exist were associated
with commercial pursuits in the Old
Land, and doubtless the business
instinct which he has inherited from
his forbears on both sides of the
house has proved, in combination
with his capacity for hard work, no
small factor towards the ultimate
success which has crowned his efforts.
Mr. R. R. Caldwell was educated at
Ramsey Collegiate School, Isle of
Man, which he attended until
reaching the age of sixteen, when he
returned to the parental rooftree.
He was then placed in charge of the
sheep section of the operations
conducted by his father, whom he
continued to assist for some years.
On arriving at years of manhood he
obtained a post in a wool store in
the city of Glasgow, spending some
considerable time in this establish-
ment with the view of gaining expert
knowledge of the technicalities of
the industry. When in his middle
twenties he decided to strike out for
himself, and with the small patri-
mony which was his portion set out
from the Old World by s.s. “Sorata,”
with the intention of settling in New
Zealand. On arrival in Melbourne
en route, however, he was advised
by a maternal uncle, a medical
practitioner of that city, to settle
in Australia, and realizing the great
possibilities of the Continent decided
that such a course would be a wise
one. Of his brothers the elder is a
citizen of Texas, America, and the
younger is engaged in the wool
industry in Glasgow. Mr. Caldwell
having, shortly after his arrival,
secured a position as jackaroo on
“Yanga” Station, in the Riverina
district of New South Wales, spent
only a short time in Victoria. He
remained about a year at “Yanga,”
obtaining during that time a good
grounding in the pastoral industry.
With the view of widening his
experience he relinquished his first
post to take a position in Queens-
land, where he became storekeeper
at "Thurulagoona,” a station in the
south-western portion of the State
and then in the ownership of Messrs.
Morphett Bros. In the early
eighties he became overseer of
“Thurulagoona,” and for the follow-
ing three years was occupied with
the duties of that position, being
thus engaged when the property was

the Winton district, and with this
objective he set out from “Fort,
Bourke” Station in charge of a flock
of ewes, being on the roads from
February until June, when he
secured 150 square miles of vacant
country in the rich pastoral district
outlying the town of Winton. The
possibilities of this land, which,
being waterless, would then have
supplies were secured at depths of
3G and 46 feet. Having successfully
overcome the initial water difficulty
he was able to stock the run, to the
area of which he subsequently
completed a very successful trip.

years to the development of his

can look back on a life of “big
things,” is very modest about his
own fine and practical conception
of citizenship. He married in the

the late Wiliam Brown and adopted

To Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell were born
three sons and three daughters, all
of whom were educated at the
“Happy Valley” home. The eldest
son, Robert Ramsey, made the
supreme sacrifice in the course of
the Great War of 1914-18, being
twenty-four years of age at the time
of his death. In response to the
call of the Motherland in her hour
of need he enlisted with the Austra-
lian Imperial Forces in August,
1916, and before the end of that
year was on his way to the
scene of action on the Western
Front. After an unbroken record
of service in France he died in
action during an engagement on the
Somme, upholding
to the end of
his young life the
traditions of the
race from which he
sprang. Alexander
Garland, the second
son of Mr. Cald-
well, was born at
“Happy Valley” on
April 20, 1899,
and, since the con-
clusion of his
studies, has assist-
ed in the admin-
istration of the

he and his brother,
John Ramsey, are
interested. The
latter was born
on February 8,

engaged in pas-
toral pursuits,

JOHN MACKELLAR CHIS-
HOLM, “Wantalayna,” Winton,
was born at Goulburn, New South
Wales, an April 13, 1888, and is the
eldest son of Mr. Harry Chisholm,
the principal of the Sydney firm of
MR. J. M. CHISHOLM.
H. Chisholm & Co., whose reputation
as a blood stock salesman and
breeder is as wide as the Continent
itself. The family of which Mr. J.
Mackellar Chisholm is a member
was founded in Australia by his
great-grandfather, James Chisholm,
and the children of the owner of
“Wantalayna” are of the fifth
generation of the line in Australia.
Born in Midlothian, Scotland, in the
year 1770, James Chisholm arrived
at Port Jackson at the age of twenty
as a member of the New South Wales
Corps, which was formed for service
in the convict settlement founded in
Australia under Governor Phillip in
1788. He continued for several
years to be associated with military
affairs in the infant Colony, relin-
quishing his connection with the
regiment when it was ordered to
England in 1810. With the acquire-
ment of "Kipilaw," he became one
of the earliest pastoral landholders
in New South Wales, and each gen-
eration of his descendants has been
represented in the pastoral industry.
He married Mary, daughter of
William Bowman, and grand-
daughter of John Bowman, the date
of whose arrival is recorded at 1798.
John William Chisholm, who was
born at ‘‘Calder House," Sydney,
founded in the vicinity of Goul-
burn “Wollogorang,” an historical
jiastoral home which has been in the
Chisholm family for over three-
quarters of a century, and which
was famed for its shorthorn stock
in the early days. He married
Rebecca, daughter of Peter Stuckey,
of Longreach, Marulan, New South
Wales. Mr. Harry Chisholm, son
of Mr. J. W. Chisholm, and
grandson of the original pioneer,
was born at “Wollogorang.” He
was a well-known figure in
pioneering racing circles and enjoys
distinction as having been associated
as a committeeman, with that old
established and highly reputed body,
the Australian Jockey Club, for a
great number of years, and as a
pioneer member of many other
leading racing clubs of the South.
He is a member of the Union Club
of Sydney, of which his father-in-
law, Mr. Alexander Mackellar, was
the first president. Mr. Harry
Chisholm married Margaret, daugh-
ter of Mr. Alexander Mackellar.
His eldest son, the owner of
“Wantalayna,” who also is
a member of the Union Club,
Sydney, was educated at Armidale
School, New South Wales, and on
terminating his career at that
academy entered the Hawkesbury
Agricultural College, where, after a
two years’ course, he graduated.
"WANTALAYNA" HOMESTEAD.
On leaving Hawkesbury he returned
to “Wollogorang,” the family home,
and there was placed in charge of
the shorthorn stud, which, from a
period dating as far back as the
fifties, has been a marked feature of
this station. He was also given the
management of the blood stock stud
in the equine department of
“Wollogorang," and carried out the
various duties of his position for
nearly two years, resigning with the
view of gaining further experience
in the Northern State. Accepting
a position on “Havilah,” New South
Wales, he spent two years on this
station, making good use of his
opportunities of becoming familiar
with the best methods of working
the studs of sheep, cattle and horses,
for which it is noted, and eventually
sought still wider experience by
journeying to Fiji, where he
continued to interest himself in
stock on “Vuma,” the largest cattle
property on the Island. At the end
of a year he returned to Australia,
and, proceeding to the Mitchell
district, purchased “Oakley," a
property in the vicinity of Torrens
Creek township and now in the
ownership of the Messrs. Walker
Bros. He retained “Oakley," which
he largely developed, until the
outbreak of war between the
Motherland and Germany in the
year 1914, when, actuated by that
spirit which prompted the patriotism
of so many of his countrymen, he
sacrificed his immediate prospects of
a successful future in order to
uphold the most cherished tradi-
tions of the race. With the
Light Horse he served in Egypt,
Sinai, and Palestine, and, in the
course of the campaigns in these
countries, attained a captaincy,
fulfilling the duties of adjutant for
two years. He eventually contracted
chronic malaria, and at the end of
the year 1917, was invalided to
Australia, where he resumed his
connection with the pastoral

stud was founded on a number
of pedigreed stud book cows pur-
chased from Mr. William Hawley,
of “Annandale,” Talangatta, Vic-
toria, and a couple of choice heifers
and a bull from the “Gladbrook”
stud, one of the most highly reputed
concerns of its kind in New Zealand.
Of the bulls, the most worthy of
mention is “Tattoo” (imp. No. 1103)
by “British Mark” (imp. from
England) No. 34154. “Tattoo” was
imported from New Zealand, and,
on the dam’s side, is a descendant
of several generations of high class
pedigreed stock bred in the famous
“Ballindalloch” stud. The other
animals of the stud are equally well
bred as the stud book shows.

upholding the reputation which his
forbears established in regard to the
breeding of high-class stock, and has
already demonstrated the correctness
of his judgment—the result of years
of study—in pioneering the Aber-
deen Angus breed in Northern
Queensland. His confidence in the
future of the type is justified, as,
in the few years which have elapsed
since his first experiments, he has

stock. During the past ten years
Aberdeen Angus cattle have been
ahead of the other popular breeds in
the weight class in Great Britain.
Mr. Chisholm married in the year
1917 Marjory Mac-
kellar, daughter of
Arthur Giles, Esq.,
8.A., master for
over 35 years of
the Sydney Gram-
mar School. The
Giles family were
identified for many
generations with
the Northern Shires
of England, and
were represented
both in agricul-
tural life and in
the Church. Mr.
and Mrs. Chisholm
have a family of
two sons.

agricultural pursuits in that County
for many generations, in the course
of which the name became well
known and highly esteemed. On his
arrival to years of manhood he was
made acquainted with the potentiali-
ties of the British Colonies and, with
the wonderful possibilities of Aus-
tralia as an incentive, set out for this
country in the year 1887, here to
carve an honourable ' career and
incidentally take his place among
the Empire builders who have
contributed to the development of
the States by assisting in the
transformation of vast wastes into
richly productive areas. Shortly
after landing he proceeded to
“Monara,” a pastoral property in
New South Wales, where he was
initiated into several aspects of stock
and station work, but, breaking his
arm as the result of a riding accident
and being consequently incapaci-
tated for a time, he relinquished his

post within a short period of his
advent to the country. Subse-
quently, he set out on a journey to
the copper districts in the western
part of the State, and became
engaged in mining. He followed
the industry in the then Colony for
some time, but with the information
gained meanwhile of the possibilities
and conditions of the various
Colonies of the land of his adoption,
came his decision to try the prospects
of the great North-east. Material-
izing his intention he arrived in
Queensland in the latter part of the
year 1888 and proceeding to the
Etheridge fields in the Cook district,
again actively associated himself
with the mining industry, which ho
followed until finding himself in a
position to make an independent
start in less unstable pursuits.
With the conviction that primary

independence, he purchased a cane
farm on the Johnstone River, in the
district outlying Innisfail, and there
carried on sugar-growing for seven
years. At the end of that period,


so as to secure a wider scope for his
energies, he sold out of this property
and purchased a similar concern in
the Mulgrave district further north,
on which, as a side issue of the main
industry he experimented very suc-
cessfully in the cultivation of Indian

corn, proving that the North is
highly suitable for the production of
this cereal when the correct methods
are adopted. After working his
Mulgrave farm for a considerable
period he decided to carry out an
intention he had long entertained of
investing in the pastoral industry,
and, accordingly, selling his sugar
interests, he visited Western Queens-
land and purchased a couple of
thousand sheep. This speculation
turned out disastrously owing to the
fact that it was followed by a serious
drought, which necessitated the
transference 1 of the stock to the
Cairns district, from whence they
were travelled for feed into the
interior. Many succumbed to the
rainless conditions, and handicapped
by what at that time was to him a
serious loss, Mr. Grimshaw sold the
remainder and returned to the sugar
industry, purchasing “Hornseywood”
Farm, another property in the
vicinity of Cairns, to the working of
which he devoted fourteen years,
adding to his acreage and bringing
it to a high stage of development.
At the end of that period, in 1914,
he again essayed to win success as a
grazier, selecting a western property
known as “Donald Downs.” He
held this station for about six years,
eventually disposing of it to the
Messrs. Bowly Bros. In 1918 he
purchased “Mackunda Downs,” and
somewhat later, “Acacia Downs,”
an adjoining block, the total area
now administered by Mr. Grimshaw
and his sons comprising an acreage
of about 200,000, which includes
country lying about fifteen miles
from the home property. Both
sheep and cattle are depastured on
the different runs, the flocks aver-
aging a total strength of 12,000 and
the cattle numbering 2,000 head.
Varying from hilly, pebbly country
to Mitchell and Flinders grass
downs the country on the whole
carries a good supply of timber of
both shade and edible varieties. It
is watered by a flowing bore and
pumping supplies, and, in addition,
by several holes which, retaining
supplies after moderate rains, may
be relied upon in ordinary seasons.
"HORNSEYWOOD FARM," OLD HOME OF THE GRIMSHAW FAMILY IN CAIRNS DISTRICT.
The homestead, which is situated 130
miles from Winton on the direct
route from that town to Boulia is
a most comfortable and up-to-date
building. Though of a retiring
disposition, Mr. Grimshaw was
prominently to the fore in all things
that count for good citizenship
during his long residence in the
vicinity of Cairns. Both he and
Mrs. Grimshaw had the interests of
the district at heart and were
amongst the most energetic support-
ers of charitable and patriotic
movements. They shared the respect
and good-will of all classes of the
community, and on the eve of their
departure for Western Queensland,
were presented with an illuminated
address expressive of these senti-
ments and the appreciation in which
they were universally held. Mr.
Grimshaw married in the year 1890
Mary Ann, daughter of the late
Donald Ross, of Tain, Ross and
Cromarty, Scotland, a member of an
old family of that County. Of the
union there is a surviving family of
four sons, Messrs. Joseph Donald,
John Henry, William James Cockey,
and Frederick Gordon Grimshaw,
all of whom were born and educated
in Northern Queensland. Mr. J.
H. Grimshaw, the second eldest
is a past student of the Towns-
ville Grammar School. The four
brothers are now engaged with their
father in the administration of the
properties, in which the interests of
father and sons are combined. The
eldest son, who is a member of the
Masonic craft, volunteered for active
service with the Australian Imperial
Forces during the Great War, and
fought in France in the front line
until the declaration of peace.

whose birth occurred in the old
English town of Frome, in Somerset-
shire, in the year 1817, and who,
ninety-five years later, died at
Bondi, near Sydney, his career being
fraught with events which instance
the noble part he played in develop-
ing the resources of the distant
outposts of the Empire which lie
beneath the Southern Cross. Pro-
genitors of the late gentleman on
both sides of his house represented
various walks of life in the old land,
his father, the late Very Rev. Charles
Phillott (the grandfather of the
gentleman under review) having
been a clergyman of the Established
Church and rector of Frome,
Somersetshire, while a maternal
relative, Admiral Pender, swept the
seas on his flagship “Belle Isle” in
the days when the old wooden walls
of England guarded the Empire by
their gallant service, making possible
of realization the marvellously
organized British Naxy of to-day,
manned by men who have fully
upheld the glorious traditions con-
stituted by their forefathers. Ere
reaching his teens the late Mr.
Phillott visited India, and later,
while still a lad, became a midship-
man of the “Belle Isle,” commanded
by Admiral Pender. He spent
several years in the Navy, in the
course of which he visited different
parts of the world, eventually
arriving in Australian waters. Very
shortly afterwards he resigned from
the Naval Service and took up
pastoral land in the Coonamble
district of New South Wales which
he named “Colane,” and for some
years his operations in the industry
were attended by a large measure of
success. In time, however, bad
seasons, following one on the other,
acted detrimentally to his prospects
as a landowner, and he was forced to
abandon his holdings and to obtain
a livelihood in the capacity of a
station manager. In this way he was
employed by two of the original
pioneer pastoralists of New South
Wales, the late Sir Charles Nicholson,
of “Luddenham,” near Penrith, in
MR. E. P. PHILLOTT.
the parent Colony, and Mr. W. F.
Buchanan, of “Warrana,” near
Coonamble. On behalf of the latter
he also transacted dealings in stock
and undertook the responsibilities of
droving, etc., completing many long
overland trips with cattle both in
New South Wales and Queensland.
He is recorded as having been one of
the first men to travel cattle over the
Blue Mountains, and his reputation
as an expert in all matters relating to
stock and as an amateur veterinarian
his name was widely established. In
subsequent times, relinquishing his
managerial career, he secured the
mail contract from Mudgee to Pipe-
clay, Gulong, and other diggings,
running coaches to and from these
centres for a number of years, risking
many dangers in the course of his
duties, not the least among which
were the frequent raids of notorious
bushrangers which terrorized the
country more or less at that epoch of
its history. He also owned lines of
coaches over many parts of New
South Wales and was known as one
of the best whips who, up to that
time, had ever driven a team in the
pastoral districts of the then Colony,
and will yet be remembered by many
travellers who accompanied him over
the perilous passes of the Blue
Mountains. For some years previous
to his death, which eventuated in the
year 1913, the late E. P. Phillott
lived in retirement with a married
daughter, at Bondi, perfectly retain-
ing his faculties to the very last. He
married on February 3, 1852, at All
Saints’ Church, Parramatta, Miss
Emily New, the result of the union
being four sons and two daughters.
The second son, Mr. Edward Pender
Phillott, of “Colane,” Queensland,
was educated partly at Mudgee, New
South Wales, but chiefly, as was
usual in the early pioneering days
when educational facilities were
counted among the vague blessings
yet to come, by private tuition within
the family circle. His hours of study
were few, as before reaching the age
of ten he was requisitioned for work
on “Warrana,” which his father
managed on behalf of the late W. F.
MR. E. C. P. PHILLOTT.
Buchanan for ten years, the help
which he was then capable of
rendering being of no small value.
He remained on “Warrana” until
the middle seventies, when he struck


out on his own account by taking
charge of a mob of sheep despatched
from “Iladdon Rig” Station to the
Sydney markets, a fact which speaks
volumes for his capability in view of
MR. C. H. PAINE.
the fact that then he was only fifteen
years of age. Until the last year of
his teens he continued operations on
the New South Wales stock routes as
satisfaction in regard to his earlier
efforts, he decided to travel further
afield, and in the following year
entered upon droving operations
which took him over the routes
extending from New South Wales tP
Western and North-western Queens-
land, in charge of cattle destined to
stock land taken up in the Northern
State at that period by various
pioneers, and which, according to
then existing land laws, it was
necessary to stock ere tenure became
valid. En passant it may be men-
tioned that in the course of his
duties in the above connection he
visited most of the Queensland
pastoral holdings which, from thence
onwards, continued to increase in
importance as centres from which
the great industry expanded. He
accepted, in 1883, a position with
the well-known firm of Cobb & Co.,
with whom he was engaged in sheep
and cattle droving for the ensuing
three years. At the termination of
that period an offer from the late J.
A. Macartney, F.R.G.S., resulted in
the continuance of his career as a
drover, and for a considerable time
he was engaged in travelling stock
from the above-named gentleman’s
“Diamantina Lakes” property to the
markets of New South Wales and
Victoria. While so engaged he
pastoral success was afforded by the
wider areas open for selection in the
Northern portion of the State.
Accordingly, in the year 1896, he
selected country which previously

formed part of “Elderslie,” a
property situated near Winton. In
the following year his marriage took
place, and with his bride he settled
a sheep drover, his ability becoming
more widely recognized by stock and
station owners with the successful
accomplishment of several trips. In

vicinity of Cunnamulla, named
“Moorabinda,” but subsequently
disposed of it, being under the
conviction that greater scope for
at Winton where he made his home.
Meanwhile he proceeded with the
development of his holding, the
acreage of which, originally 20,000,
he gradually increased by further


selection and purchase to six figures.
He named the area “Colane,” after
the property held by his father in
New South Wales, and subsequently
entered into residence thereon,
in its near vicinity, the grounds
being ornamented with shrubs and
fruit trees and a tennis court. To a
degree unusual in the West the out-
buildings fulfil the requirements of

yielded big-framed stock, noted for
the production of fleece equal in
weight to any grown in the North.

membership of the various bodies
founded in North Queensland, and in
his occupancy of the vice-president-
ship of the Winton Jockey Club. In
the early years of his career he
experienced the many hardships and
sacrifices inseparable from pioneering
labours in sparsely settled country —
possible starvation, resulting from
delayed supplies, the necessity of
swimming swollen rivers to obtain
food to avert such a catastrophe not
only for himself but for many others,
and the difficulty with the natives,
etc., being all in the game as played
by the pioneers of Australia, who
found their happiness, no doubt,
in the knowledge that they lived as
men, combating the forces of nature
as only men know how, with the
realization that whatever the out-
come, their labours would remain as
initial stages in the vast scheme of
development which marks the pro-
gress of our nationhood. Mr. Phillott
married in the year 1897 Constance
Clara, daughter of the late
Charles Henry Paine, who, born of
English parents in New South
Wales, three quarters of a century
ago, was for twenty-five years
identified with the development and
progress of Western Queensland,
successfully managing various
pastoral properties on behalf of the
owners during his long career in the
State. For many years he was
particularly well known as the
administrator of “Bladensburg,” in
the district outlying Winton, and in
this capacity was associated with the
late J. A. Macartney, who owned
■vast areas in Queensland, and whose
enterprise contributed largely to the
impetus which the pastoral industry
received at that period. As one of
the oldest pioneers of the West,
Mr. Paine was always keenly
interested in its welfare, and for a
considerable number of years filled a
seat on the Board of the Winton
Shire Council. He will be well
remembered, too, in connection with
his functions as starter and handi-
capper of both race clubs in Winton,
which he fulfilled for a very lengthy
period. After his retirement from
active life he resided at “Colane,
where in the autumn of his days he
was cheered by the company of his
kith and kin. Of the union of Mr. and
Mrs. Phillott there is a family of
three sons and seven daughters. The
eldest, Edward Charles Pender
Phillott, was born at Winton on
January 12, 1899, and educated at
the Southport School, where his
younger brothers are now receiving
s 2
their scholastic training. At time of
writing Mr. E. C. Pender Phillott is
engaged in assisting his father in the
administration of “Colane.”


BRINSLEY EDWARD LANE,
J.P., “Mayfair,” Winton, is the
eldest son of the late Thomas Tom
Lane, whose forbears were of Celtic
origin and descendants of very old
MR. T. T. LANE.
and well-known Cornish stock. The
branch of the Lane family from
which the gentleman under review
is descended was founded in Austra-
lia just one hundred years ago by
his grandfather, the late William
Lane. This gentleman, who was
accompanied from the Old World by
his young wife, and whose eldest
child, John, was born at sea, settled
in New South Wales on land of
which he became the owner by grant
from the Imperial Government, this
being then in accordance with the
custom of the Crown in the case of
settlers bringing capital to the
country. Mr. Lane’s earliest pro-
perty was situated near Bathurst
and was known as “Orton Park.”
He later took up “Kiackatoo” and
“Mickaville,” two large and adjoin-
ing pastoral areas on the Lachlan
River. The “Orton Park” property
eventually came to his youngest son,
who disposed of it to the McPhil-
lamy family. The Lanes became
well known in different parts of New
South Wales, particularly in the
Orange district, where they were
represented both in pastoral and
civil life, the late John Tom Lane,
an uncle of Mr. Lane of “Mayfair,”
having been the Police Magistrate
of that town for well nigh half a
century. A branch of the family
was established in New Zealand by
AVilliam, another son of the old
pioneer. The original founder of
the line under the Southern Cross
married a Miss Tom, who was also
of old Cornish descent, and of the
union there were seven sons and
three daughters, the second son
being the late Thomas Tom Lane,
who was born at “Orton Park.”
The last-mentioned gentleman fol-
lowed pastoral pursuits in New
South Wales for several years,
owning near Orange, a station called
“Narrambla,” which he formed
from a grant of land received from
the existing Government, whose gifts
at that time were tendered to
likely citizens for the purpose of
promoting settlement. Mr. T. T
Lane married Elizabeth, a daughter
MR. B. E. LANE.
of the Rev. Falloom, D.D., a clergy-
man of the Established Church of
Ireland, and a member of a very old
Irish family. At his death, which
occurred at Orange in the year
1897, he left a family of seven
sons and two daughters. The eldest
son, Mr. B. E. Lane, of "Mayfair,”
was born at “Narrambla,” and there,
under private tuition, received the
greater part of his education, dis-
continuing his studies when at the
age of seventeen to take over the
duties of overseer at “Calubri ’
Station. While still a school boy
he was more or less associated with
the stock which formed the basis of
his father’s operations, and, ere
becoming overseer of “Calubri,” had
travelled hundreds of miles with fat
sheep from the Bogan to Melbourne.
At “Calubri” he spent two years,
and from there in 1872, went to
“Nyngan” Station as manager, a
post which he retained until, after
a period of four years, “Cremorne,
a holding in the same district, was
placed under his control. On relin-
quishing the management of “Cre-
morne” he was offered a similar
position at “Nevertire” Station, a
property then in the ownership-of
the late John C. Ryrie, under whom
he occupied various offices of trust
during the following three years.
In 1882 Mr. Ryrie promoted him to
the management of “Vergemont,”
an important Queensland property
situated on Vergemont Creek, a
tributary of the Thomson. Mr.
Lane administered “Vergemont,”
which at the time of his appointment
embraced about 1,400 square miles,
for over fourteen years. He finally
severed his connection with the
property to enter the industry on
Ids own account, purchasing “Strath-
fillan” in the year 1896. The great
drought which, after spreading
devastaton for several years in some
parts of the country finally gave
place to normal conditions in 1901,
militated disastrously against his
enterprise on this property, reducing
his flock of 11,000 to a figure between
3,000 and 4,000, this remnant being
MR. R. W. LANE.
saved by removal to agistment
country. In 1899 lie disposed of
such assets as remained to him on
“Strathfillan” and took up a 20,000-
acre block of grazing land, which he


named "Mayfair” Subsequently,
lie added to this property both by
selection and purchase, so that it
now comprises 60,000 acres of fine
grazing country, the character of
which is indicated by well sheltered
Mitchell and Flinders grass downs
and occasionally recurring hills.
Saville Creek intersects the area,
providing good natural water for the
stock, which are further served by
sub-artesian supplies and the output
of the Middleton bore. The develop-
ment of “Mayfair” has reached a
high point of excellence and has
been carried out for the working of
both woolly and horned stock,
the sheep industry being the main-
stay of the run, which depastures on
an average a flock of 12,000, that
was originally built up from a
nucleus of “Kynuna” Station ewes
and “Sylvania” rams. A marked
improvement on an already desirable
strain has since been effected by the
introduction of rams from the best
Southern studs. The “Mayfair'’
homestead lies within a couple of
miles from the township of Middle-
ton and 110 miles from Winton.
Of artistic and modern design, it is
composed of two storeys, being
furnished with large balconies from
which, on every side, may be viewed

FREDERICK ARTHUR HAT-
FIELD, “Wongan,” Winton, was
born in St. Lawrence, a township
lying between Rockhampton and
Mackay, on July 31, 1874, and is the
tenth child of the late Thomas Hat-
field, who was one of the pioneers of
MR. T. HATFIELD.
the Central district of Queensland.
Of early foundation in Australia the
Hatfield family was established
under the Southern Cross by the
father of the last-mentioned gentle-
man, also Thomas Hatfield, who,
hailing from Yorkshire, where for
many generations the name had been
associated with agrarian pursuits,
arrived in New South Wales a
century ago, residing for several
years in the Mother State and
subsequently participating in the
various historical gold rushes that
jmarked the birth of the mining
industry in the young Continent.
His son Thomas, who established the
name in Queensland, was born in
Liverpool, New South AVales, over
ninety years ago, and was amongst
the very earliest arrivals to the vast
territory which now comprises the
Northern State. He is recorded as
one of a pioneering group which was
prominently identified with the
earliest find of copper in Queens-
land, and successfully accomplished
the difficult task of conveying to
St. Lawrence the first ore raised at
Copperfield. The St. Lawrence
route was more direct, but in those
days the main range was the most
difficult problem. Mr. Hatfield
undertook to work his teams over the
range, which many of the old hands
thought would not pay him. He
was so successful, however, that he
engaged additional teams to fulfil
his contracts. Whilst so employed
he was also interested in commercial
pursuits in St. Lawrence. Here he
owned a store and hotel, and, on a
partnership basis, a couple of
schooners for trade to Sydney, and
became interested in the pastoral
industry, taking up the property
situated on the Isaacs River known
as “Yatton.” Tie subsequently sold
out his interests at St. Lawrence
and opened a store at Clermont,
which after conducting for some
years he disposed of to devote
himself more exclusively to his
landed interests to which he had
added in the meantime by acquiring
country in the outlying district.
This land was named “Fleurs,” and
while in the tenure of the Hatfield
family became freehold. The late
Thomas Hatfield was a fine example
of the type of manhood by which
nations are made, being the possessor
of unbounded courage, resource, and
endurance and a temperament in
which integrity, enterprise, and
industry were blended in a marked
degree. At his death, which
occurred at “Fleurs” in the year
1882, he was survived by a widow
and eleven children. Of the latter
five are still living, four being
resident in the Clermont district.
Mr. F. A. Hatfield was educated in
Clermont, assimilating during his
school days a very thorough know-
ledge of the many details included
in the running of a grazing property
and at an early age taking his share
with the older members of the
family of stock work on “Fleurs”
and “Yatton.” He was thus
engaged in the joint interests of the
family until the year 1889, when he
accepted a position on “Craven”
Station, of which he was appointed
manager two years later, fulfilling
the duties of that position on behalf
of the trustees of the J. C. Ryrie
Estate until 1902, when the property
was abandoned owing to the disas-
trous effects of the drought of that
period, which decimated the herd,
necessitating the removal of the few
remaining stock to “Bendeena,” a
holding near the New South Wales
border, From this time onwards
Mr. Hatfield undertook and com-
pleted several droving engagements
and subsequently entered upon a
career of station management, suc-
cessively administering various
Queensland areas until the year
1914, when he selected his present
homestead block, which formerly
formed part of “Ayrshire Downs”
resumption. “Wongan” comprises
about 16,000 acres of Mitchell and
Flinders grass plains and is situated
about 56 miles from Winton in a
north-westerly direction. It depas-
tures a flock of between 5,000 and
6,000 sheep. Mr. Hatfield is a
member of the Winton Club. He
is attached to the Masonic Craft.
A keen judge of horses and a
supporter of the various amateur
racing events of the district, he holds
also a membership in many of the
leading clubs of the west. A well-
known owner, he has scored consid-
erable success with his horses at
amateur meetings, and when inter-
ested in “Fleurs” extended his
sporting proclivities to the metropol-
itan turf, a past winner of the
Queensland Cup being a “Fleurs”
horse. He married in the year

bers of a family which was founded
in Australia by Dr. Robert Trevor
MAJOR R. T. FETHERSTONHARGH.

the Continent in the eighties, chose
Victoria as the scene of his activities
and there established himself in his
profession, practising successively in
Kyneton, Talbot, and Geelong for a
period covering twenty-six years.
The eventuation of the Great War
of 1914-18 found him ready to place
his services at the disposal of his
King and country, and resulted in
his departiAe for the front with the
Australian Army Medical Corps,
with which he served in the military
hospitals of Egypt and England
until his return to Australia, when
he was attached to the base hospital,
Melbourne, being subsequently asso-
ciated with the Brisbane branch of

is a surviving family of three sons.
The eldest, Trevor Gayer Fether-
stonhaugh, who ere entering upon his
University course was a student at
the famous old Geelong Grammar
School, is also a member of the
medical fraternity and a Fellow of
the Royal College of Surgeons,
Edinburgh. Graduating at the
University of Melbourne, he par-
ticipated in the Great War as a
surgeon of the Royal Army Medical
Corps in Mesopotamia, being
wounded while in action with his
unit He was attached to the 14th
Hussars and continued with this
regiment until the end of hostilities,
and was awarded the Military Cross
in recognition of his services on the
battlefield. Of the brothers whose
interests are centred in Western
Queensland the elder is ROBERT
WORSE LEY FETHERSTON-
HAUGH, who on concluding his
scholastic education, which he pur-
sued at Geelong Grammar School,
entered, as the first step towards a
career on the land, upon a year’s
course at the Dookie Agricultural
College, and later, to gain further
practical acquaintance with the pas-
toral industry, spent some time on
“Berrambool” Station in Victoria.
With the same objective he proceeded
to Queensland in the year 1912 to
fill a post on “Marathon’’ Station,
in the Hughenden district, and two

years later acquired a holding in the
vicinity of Winton in conjunction
with his youngest brother, Francis.
On the outbreak of war he was not
behind the other members of his
family in proving his loyalty and
patriotism, but his application for
service at the front was rejected.
TALBOT FRANCIS FETHER-
STONHAUGH, the younger mem-
ber of the firm, ere taking a course
at Longerenong Agricultural Col-
lege, was educated in Geelong at the
academy already mentioned as hav-
ing been the Alma Mater of his
brothers. He took a certificate of
competency at Longerenong, and in
1914 proceeded to Queensland to join
his brother in pastoral enterprise.
However, the momentous incident
which precipitated the Great War in
August of that year caused a re-
adjustment of affairs, and the
Messrs. Fetherstonhaugh, sinking
all selfish considerations, offered
their services to the Empire in
her need, the application of
the younger brother meeting
with acceptance. He joined the
colours in the year 1915, and was
despatched to Egypt with the Field
Artillery, and was later amongst the
first Australians sent to France.
After participating in many engage-
ments on the Western Front he was
wounded in the Somme operations
and invalided to England. On
recovering he was again sent to
France, becoming a casualty for the
second time in 1917 during the Ypres
engagements, when he was gassed.
In 1918 he was invalided to Aus-
tralia, and when sufficiently restored
to health resumed his active con-
nection with pastoral affairs as part
owner in the firm of Fetherstonhaugh
Bros., of “Lana Downs” and
“Albrighton,” in North-west Queens-
land. These two well-known proper-
ties aggregate approximately about
41,000 acres of Mitchell and Flinders
grass country, and are provided with
comfortable homesteads. “Lana

JAMES RHODES, “Mount
Campbell,” Winton, was born near
Casterton, Victoria, on August 13,
1861, and is the second son of the
late William Rhodes, a native of
MR. W. RHODES.
Yorkshire, England, who arrived
in Australia in the early fifties.
After spending some considerable
time on the Victorian goldfields, he
took up land near Casterton, in the
Western District of the then Colony,
naming his holding “Greylands. ‘ ’
Here, by dint of untiring and rightly
directed industry, he was enabled
from time to time to purchase and
add to his original acquirement
other small properties, to the
development of which, as a whole,
he was engaged until the time
of his death, which occurred in
the year 1901. Many decades
ago he was prominently associated
with local government, occupying
the presidentship of the local
Shire Council, an office now held
by his grandson, Councillor H.
H. Rhodes. “Greylands” is still
held by his descendants. Mr.
James Rhodes was educated at a
public school in the vicinity of his
home. At an early age his studies
had to give place to the important
work of development on the home
acres, for at that time all available
family labour was needed and
requisitioned to run a small holding
successfully. Fie assisted his father
in his varied operations until reach-
ing his thirtieth year, when he set
out, with a younger brother, Wil-
liam Rhodes, for Queensland with
the object of taking up country in
this State. Shortly after their
arrival the Messrs. Rhodes invested
their capital in a block named
“Towal," which they selected from
a resumed portion of “Bowen
Downs.” After submitting this
place to a course of development
they sold out their interests in it
and took up “Cressy.” At about
this time the younger brother
founded “The Rand,” a property
in the vicinity of Longreach.
Disposing of “Cressy” in 1899,
Mr. James Rhodes joined his
brother in the purchase of “Tocal,”
on the Thomson River, which
well-known station was jointly
administered until 1909, when it
was sold and the partnership mutu-
ally dissolved, Mr. William Rhodes
then retiring to Victoria. During
the following year Mr. James
Rhodes selected “Mount Campbell,”
designating this block after a moun-
tain situated on the property.
“Mount Campbell,” which occupies
a site on the Winton-Kynuna road,
56 miles from the former centre,
embraces 24,000 acres of lightly-
timbered Mitchell grass downs.
Having a double frontage of over
four miles to the Diamantina River
it receives a good natural water
supply from that stream and from
O’Brien Creek, which also intersects
the run, these sources being amply
supplemented by a number of dams
and the output of an artesian bore.
Mr. Rhodes is a member of the

eldest son, joined the colours on
concluding his seventeenth year
and was despatched to the western
war theatre, serving in France until

wounds in the front line at Lihons,
having previously participated in
the operations at Villers Breton-
neux, Hamel, and in the great
offensive on the Somme on August
8, 1918, when the tide of the war
was decisively turned. Since his
return to Australia he, with a
younger brother, has been engaged
in assisting his father in the admin-
istration of “Mount Campbell.’'

a pastoral property in the vicinity of
Hughenden, was born at Ararat,
MR. L. G. C. REID.
Victoria, on August 3, 1870. He is
the only surviving son of the late F.
A. S. Reid, and a grandson of the
MR. D. MCK. CAMERON.
late Major-General Francis Archi-
bald Reid, who was born in
Devonshire, England, in the year
1803, of a union contracted between
his father (the great-grandfather of
the gentleman under review) and a
Miss Savage, a member of another
Devonshire family of note, in the
latter part of the eighteenth century.
Major-General Reid was descended
from an old County family, various
members of which were engaged in
different professional callings and as
officers of the British Army during
succeeding eras of history, the distaff
side of his house contributing many
individuals to the membership of
the Church. He was twice wedded,
on the first occasion to Elizabeth
Pincent Slatterley Tucker, who died
in 1833 at the age of twenty-four.
H is second marriage was celebrated
in the year 1836, when he espoused
Mary, daughter of the late Murdock
MacKenzie, of “Dundonnell,”
Rosshire, by whom he had a family
of five children. Of the first union
there was one son and one daughter,
the former only surviving, and
eventually becoming the father of
Mr. L. G. C. Reid, the owner of
‘Dulverton.” The late Major-
General was engaged in his military
capacity in India at the time of the
birth of his first-born son. Sub-
sequently he proceeded to Scotland,
where at. “Phoineas House,” Inver-
nesshire, his death occurred on
November 10, 1862. His eldest son,
the late Francis Archibald Savage
Reid, was born near Madras, India,
on September 16, 1829. On the
conclusion of his education he became
a cadet officer, in which capacity he
proceeded to Australia to join the
Victorian Police, eventually becom-
ing Superintendent of that body.
Records show that he relieved Mr.
Robert O’Hara Burke of the Super-
intendency of Police at Castlemaine
in the year 1861, when that intrepid
explorer resigned the position in
order to undertake the leadership of
the tragic expedition, which is now
famous in the annals of Australian
history. The late Mr. Reid was also
stationed in Ararat and Mansfield at
different periods of his career, super-
vising the police operations in the
district surrounding those centres.
He spent some time in retirement
ere his death, which occurred in the
year 1880. His wife was Frances
Ellen, eldest daughter of the late
Dr. William Carkeet, who practised
at Heathcote and Williamstown,
VictoHa, when that now important
State was a Colony in its infancy. Of
the union there was a family of five
sons and four daughters, the sole
surviving male representative of
which, and also the only son of the
late superintendent to enter the
pastoral industry, being at present
engaged in the management of

position of overseer and sub-manager
on “Paika,” another Rivcrina
property owned by the late Peter
Macpherson. In 1900 he accepted a
post in North-western Queensland
with Mr. Edmund Jowett, taking
over the management of “Kynuna”
Station, near Winton, and various
other properties in the same district
for that gentleman. He continued to
administer “Kynuna” until 1916,
for the first twelve years on behalf
of Mr. Jowett and from 1912-13 for
the lion. Frank Bond, M.L.C., of
Tasmania, who purchased the station
in the former year, and later, for the
present owners, the Scottish
Australian Investment Co., Ltd.,
from whose service he resigned in
1916 as the result of a partnership
contracted with the Hon. Frank
Bond of “Redcliff” Station. He
selected “Dulverton” in 1913 and
later acquired a block which adjoins
that run, at about the same time
securing a portion of the resumption
of “Hamilton Downs” Station. The
three properties embrace an area
consisting of considerably over
50,000 acres of good grazing
country. Artificial means have been
successfully resorted to with the
object of providing permanent water
for the stock, earthern tanks having
been excavated and an artesian bore
is on the property, while development
still continues. So far Mr. Reid has
not gone in for sheep-breeding, but

several years he occupied a seat on
the board of the McKinlay Shire
Council, and has also adjudicated on
the Kynuna bench for a considerable
period, having been created a Justice
of the Peace by the Philp Admini-
stration in the year 1901. Although
his keen attention to his managerial
duties has earned for him the
reputation of being a man of retiring

who, born at “Arkleston,” the old
home of his family near Paisley, was
an offspring of one of the most pro-
minent millers in that well-known
Scottish manufacturing town. The
Drybroughs have resided for so
many generations in Renfrewshire
that they are spoken of as one of the
old families of the County; but their
line originated in Fife, where tradi-
tions surrounding the name or
records bearing on their history have
been handed down from quite ancient
times, showing that Mr. Dry-
brough’s progenitors were associated
chiefly with agrarian pursuits. The
founder of the family in Australia,
the late D. L. Drybrough, qualified
as an engineer in Scotland, and was
attached to a firm which, on con-
tracting to erect the Seaforth and
other of the early sugar mills in the
Burdekin district, sent him to
Queensland to supervise the erection
of these buildings. He arrived in
Townsville in the year 1880, being
then a young man in his twenties,
and from that date until the even-
tuation of his untimely death when
in the middle forties, was notably as-
sociated with the progress of North-

of the work which brought him from
the Old World he entered into part-
nership with the late E. J. Brand,
another capable engineer, and the
two sons, and one daughter. He
married Elizabeth Clark Barr, a
member of another old Scottish
family, who for some years prior to


her decease in the year 1918 resided
in England, where her family inter-
ests were chiefly centred. Of her
sons, the younger, David Norman
Drybrough, was educated in the
Motherland and on leaving school
entered the textile manufacturing
industry. At time of writing he is
carrying on a business near Man-
chester, having returned to his
original calling on the conclusion of
the Great War, in which he partici-
pated as a captain of the Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders. Mr. James
Legat Drybrough was born in Towns-
ville on November 24, 1889, and
educated at the Church of England
Grammar School, North Sydney.
On concluding his career at that
academy he left Australia for Scot-
land, where he devoted himself to
the study of engineering for some
time, taking his articles in the pro-
fession while with the firm of Fuller-
ton, Hodgart, & Barclay, Ltd., of
Paisley, in whose employ he spent
six years. In the year 1913 he re-
turned to Australia, and proceeding
to Northern Queensland became asso-
ciated with the firm of Brand & Dry-
brough at the Townsville foundry,
and was engaged with the duties of
his position here until the clash of
arms in 1914 called forth the flower
of our nationhood to fight for the
freedom and liberty which are the
heitage of the British races. He vol-
unteered for active service early in
1915, and in the same year left Aus-
tralia to join the 15th Battalion.
He served throughout the term of
the war in France, fighting in the
various battles in which the 15th en-
gaged and winning his commission
on the field. During the campaign
he was twice wounded. After the
signing of the Armistice he returned
to Australia, and, having decided to
enter the pastoral industry, in due
course joined with Mr. C. R. Somer-
set in the purchase of “Bonnie
Downs,’’ which was previously owned
by Mr. Malcolm Livingston. Mr.
Drybrough loves sport tor its own
sake, and is a supporter of all forms
of outdoor recreation, having been a
keen participant in many popular
athletic games during his college days.

Morpeth, in the Hunter River
district, where he practised for
nearly a quarter of a century, his
ministrations being coupled with a
T
large-hearted charity well worthy of
the noble profession which he so
ably represented. The late Dr.
Bennett was a direct descendant of a
line which contributed in the persons
of his father, grandfather, and
other progenitors during several
successive generations numerous
members to the medical faculty. He
was a member of the London College
of Medicine and Surgery. Apart
from his profession, his interests
included a pastoral property known
as “Woolfield,” situated at the head
of the Patterson River, in the Mother
State, upon which cattle were bred.
He was endowed by nature and
education with a high appreciation
and an excellent knowledge of the
arts, more particularly as they apply
to music. Fie also excelled as an
athlete, and won many trophies ere
leaving his native land, which now
find a resting place in his son’s home.
He is recorded as having been at
one time the amateur mile champion
cyclist in England. His wife was
Annie Edith, daughter of the late
Robert Shakeshaft, a member of
another old English family which
was established at Coventry at an
era dating far back in the history
of that town, where for centuries
the Shakeshafts have been prominent
as the owners of large weaving and
spinning mills. To Dr. and Mrs.
Bennett were born two sons, the
birth of the younger, Briton
Rivierie Bennett, having occurred
on December 31, 1900, nearly ten
years after the natal day of the
gentleman under review. Mr. B.
R. Bennett was educated at
Brighton College, England, where
he was studying during the early
part of the Great War. When
in his eighteenth year he placed
his services at the disposal of
the Motherland, being attached
to the Royal Field Artillery and
despatched with his unit to France.
After serving some time abroad he
was picked for a commission and sent
to an officers’ training school, where
he was engaged in military duty
until the armistice was declared.
Mr. F. I’on-Bennett was educated
at the Maitland High School, con-
tinuing his studies at that institu-
tion until attaining his seventeenth
year, when, choosing the land as the
basis of a future career, he accepted
a position with the New Zealand
and Australian Land Co., as jackaroo
at “Midkin” Station. Here his
ability was soon recognized and

arrival, and ere reaching the age of
20, he was appointed overseer of the

Morven and owned by his former
employers, the New Zealand and

following year he resigned in order
to enter the industry on his own
account, selecting the country on
which he now resides, and to which
he gave the name of “Woolfield,”
after his father’s old station in New
South Wales. Forthwith he applied
himself to the task of inaugurating
various developmental operations on
the property, being subsequently
enabled to add to the original area,
by the purchase of an adjoining
estate. “Woolfield” now embraces
over 40,000 acres of rolling downs

officers who took honourable part in
the early building up of the British
Empire. The late Joseph Carter
arrived in Australia in the year
1837, and after spending a few years
in Victoria, acquired a property
near Mount Gambier, South Aus-
tralia, in the early forties, where he
carried on pastoral pursuits for some
time; but when the famous gold
discoveries at Ballarat, Bendigo, and
other centres eventuated, he was one
of the many to tempt Fortune on the
various fields. The fickle dame,
however, withheld her smiles from
his efforts in this avocation, in
which he spent some considerable
time, with but little success, and at
length abandoned. Again turning
his attention to the land, he accepted
the post of manager of “Naracoorte”
Station, in which occupation he
continued until about 1870. At this
time, acting on the advice of the
late C. B. Fisher (well known during
his lifetime in pastoral and sporting
circles) he joined his brother-in-law,
the late Frank C. Brodribb, in a
t 2
venture on the Darling Downs,
taking up and developing a property
which they called “Kurrowah,” a
name which has become historical in
the early pastoral history of Queens-
land. For 15 years he managed this
station in their joint interests, when
by mutual consent the alliance was
dissolved, Mr. Carter selling his
share to his partner. Subsequently
he became interested in the grazing
industry on his own account, choos-
ing the Roma district for his new
undertaking, and in addition to
these landed interests he carried on
the business of stock and station
agent in the town. His death
occurred in the year 1894. His wife
MR. H. J. CARTER.
was an English lady, Miss Grace
Baker, daughter of the late Sir
Henry Baker, who was at one
time Lord Mayor of London. This
lady came to Australia with other
members of her family in the late
fifties, and lived at the famous
“Wanganella” Station. The late Mr.
Carter’s family consists of three sons
and four daughters, three members
of which are now living in Queens-
land—Mrs. Merriman, wife of Mr.
G. H. Merriman, of Sandgate, Mrs.
Tyrwhitt, whose husband is the
owner of “Yandarlo” Station, in the
Tambo district, and Mr. TL J.
Carter, the subject of this memoir.
Mr. H. J. Carter was educated at
the Ipswich Grammar School, then
under the supervision of Mr. Donald
Cameron, and on the termination of
his studies at this academy returned
to his home in Roma in the early
seventies. Shortly afterwards he
entered business life, joining the
staff of the Queensland National
Bank in that town (then managed
by the late C. S. Young), in which
service he remained for some time.
Eventually he accompanied the late
Horace Flower to Charleville, and
opened a branch of that institution
there, wherein he carried out the
duties of accountant for some years.
Perceiving, however, the great
opportunities which the district
afforded to a man of initiative and
enterprise, Mr. Carter decided to
relinquish his banking career. He
joined forces with Mr. Christie Mil-
lar, the late James Bradley, and
others, and founded the Great
Western Carrying Company, but
owing to the consequences of a
severe drought which occurred
shortly after its formation, it was
considered desirable to reconstruct
the company, which became known
as Millar, Carter, & Co. Under its
new title and the managership of Mr.
Carter, the business was vigorously

cailied on, and offices were opened
in Brisbane. Some years later the
dim was again reconstructed under
the trade name of H. J. Carter and
bo., Mr. Carter becoming sole


proprietor. In conjunction with the
carrying and forwarding business
Mr. Carter had for many years been
interested in stock and station agency
work; and now decided to enlarge
MR. W. MARKS.
his sphere of action in this direction
by making of it a separate concern.
Mr. R. W. D. Weaver was admitted
as a partner in the firm, which was
designated as Carter, Weaver, & Co.
Later this partnership was dissolved,
and the business, which is in a
highly flourishing condition, is now
well known throughout Queensland
as “Carter’s,” and is carried on in
the comparatively new and up-to-
date building erected by Mr. Carter
on the destruction of his older
premises by fire. These premises
have become one of the most im-
portant business centres of the West.
Among his other local interests
which are many, should be men-
tioned the Charleville Wool Scour
and the Warrego Sheep Shearing
Company. The former is controlled
in partnership with Mr. John Arm-
strong, of “Raoeview,” Charleville,
whose career is described at length
in another part of this work. The
industry is run on up-to-date lines,
the machinery used in the carrying
out of the work being of modern
design, and the equipment generally
beyond criticism. The admirable
administration and management is
evidenced by the excellent work
turned out by the employes, and by
the prices secured for the wool
handled by the company when
offered at the wool sales held in
Brisbane. In connection with the
Warrego Sheep Shearing Company,
it may be mentioned that Mr. Carter
is one of the directors of this very
prosperous concern. He has been
more or less interested in the pas-
toral industry on his own account,
becoming part-owner with Mr. Arm-
strong in the purchase of “Burran-
dilla” from the estate of the late
John Moore, of Colinton, Brisbane
Valley. The owners parted with
this station for a satisfactory figure
in 1905, after having successfully
worked it in the interval. At the

present time Mr. Carter owns two
pastoral properties —“Wardilla” and
“Middlefield”—his home being on
the first-named station. Both places
are devoted to the raising of cattle,
and at the time of writing about
2,000 shorthorns comprise the com-
bined herds. Despite the multi-
tudinous private interests which
occupy his attention, Mr. Carter yet
finds time to fulfil the many demands
for the public weal made on a man
of his standing. He is a vigorous
worker, and every cause for the
betterment of the district or the
welfare of the individual can count
on his help, which is always readily
and generously given. He has
occupied the positions of clerk to the
Mitchell Rabbit and Murweh Mar-
supial Boards work which has
necessitated the employment of a
special staff in separate offices. He
has been Mayor of Charleville,
holding that office for four suc-
cessive years, a fact which speaks
volumes in testimony of the
confidence and esteem in which he
is held by the ratepayers. He
rendered yeoman service in his
capacity of chairman of the recruit-
ing movement in the West during
the Great Way and was vice-presi-
dent of the Charleville Hospital
and chairman of the Fire Brigade
Board. He has also filled the
chair of the school of arts com-
mittee, and is one of the trustees of
the Warrego Club. Notwithstanding
his manifold labours, Mr. Carter
does not by any means advocate a
system of “all work and no play.'
He takes a live interest in the “sport
of Kings,” and in this relaxation as
in all other matters in which he in
any way concerns himself, is present
that dominant note of whole-hearted-
ness, which is one of his many fine
characteristics. It is demonstrated in
this instance in the fact that he is
vice-president of the Warrego Racing
MR. H. J. CARTER, JUN.
Club, and that he has had consider-
able success with his own horses
at the local and general western
meetings. Noticeable traits in the
character of Mr. Carter are a


broadminded philanthropy coupled
with a very retiring though earnest
disposition, underlying which is an
unlimited reserve of quiet energy.
He possesses that rare quality of
humanity that is able to recognize
and understand the needs of all
classes, to which may truly be added
that he is a man who in his daily life
acts up to the highest ideals of the
race. Suffice it to say, that he is a
worthy descendant of the line from
which he has sprung, and it is
generally admitted that his success
in life is well earned and richly
deserved. Mr. Carter married in
the year 1905, Margaret Anne,
daughter of Mr. AVilliam Sparkes,
one of the early pioneers of the West,
who was for many years identified
with the timber industry, and is now
living in retirement at Charleville.
Mr. Carter has a surviving family
of one son and one daughter.
ELLIS SUTTON, “Frampton
Park” and “Norman Vale,” Yaraka,
was born at Frampton, near Boston,
Lincolnshire, on December 21, 1852,
and is the eldest son of the late
William Sutton, whose forbears had
for many generations farmed the
acres which in turn descended to
him, and whereon he also during his
lifetime was engaged in agrarian
pursuits. Mr. Ellis Sutton, the
subject of this notice, received his
education at the local school at
Frampton, and later became appren-
ticed to the storekeeping and
drapery business at Pinchbeck, near
Spalding. He followed that calling
in various towns in England for 12
years, during which period he
studied photography, subsequently
becoming engaged in that business
for some time. Owing to depressed
times and having heard of the brisk-
ness of trade and general prosperity
prevailing in Australia, the late Mr.
Sutton decided to uproot his former
interests and sail for the land of
promise. He booked his passage by
the sailing ship “Rodda,” and after
16 weeks at sea landed at Brisbane
in October, 1885, his possessions
including a complete photographer’s
outfit, a stock of chemicals, and a
slender capital. In order to enlarge
his resources he opened a studio at
No. 7, Queen Street, where he
became engaged in photography,
meeting with such success that at the
end of two years he was offered a
position as travelling photographer
for general and press work by Mr.
Poulsen, who was even then well
known and firmly established in the
business. Selling his own concern at
MR. E. SUTTON.
a good profit he undertook the new
work, being also commissioned by the
Government of the day to secure
photographs illustrating the indus-
trial life of Central and Southern
Queensland for official use. In the
course of his peregrinations he made
his advent to Blackall, arriving there
in the year 1891, when he tendered
for and was successful in securing
the contract for delivery of mails
between Isisford and Blackall. For
a considerable period thereafter he
was personally engaged in the distri-
bution of His Majesty’s mails, and
still retains the contract, and it is
interesting to note that he was the
first mail contractor in Queensland
to carry mails by motor. He
removed from Blackall in the year
1894, centreing his interests at Isis-
ford, where he became boniface of
the Club Hotel, the leading hostelry
in the district, which is now his own
property, although he is no longer
actively interested in that sphere of
work. After relinquishing his active
connection with the hotel trade, he in
1910 leased “Gilmore” Station, which
had hitherto been conducted as a
cattle property, but which was con-
verted into a sheep proposition under
his ownership. After carrying on the
wool and mutton industry on this
estate for four years he was com-
pelled to part with it owing to the
depredations of the dingoes. Sub-
sequently he took up a block of land
on the “Mount Marlow” run, naming
it “Frampton Park,” thus linking
his newer associations with those of
an earlier era in the land of his birth.
This property was immediately
developed as a sheep proposition
and is now conducted by Mr. Sutton
from his home in Isisford, in con-
junction with another block named
“Norman Yale,” situated in the
vicinity of his earlier acquisition.
The two properties are nine miles
apart, and are conveniently situated
in regard to railway facilities, the
line running between them. The
nearest railway station is Yaraka,
the present terminus of the proposed
line from Blackall to Windorah.
Undulating country, lightly tim-
bered and well clothed with the
succulent Mitchell and blue grasses,
and carrying a healthy growth of
edible scrub and a variety of her-
bage, indicates the nature of the soil
on both estates. “Frampton Park”
is well watered by a sub-artesian bore
and several creeks, while a dam of
large capacity provides for the needs
of the “Norman Vale” stock. Mr.
Sutton has always taken an interest
in public matters, and is one of the
foundation members of the Isisford
Shire Council. For many years he
has filled the office of honorary
treasurer of the local hospital, and
has taken a prominent part in the
affairs of the local amateur racing
club, besides which he was honorary
treasurer of the local jockey club for
a considerable period. The district
Oddfellows’ Lodge owes its founda-
tion to his efforts, and for a lengthy
period he has been a member of the
Masonic fraternity. He married in
the year 1876 Annie, daughter of
the late George Hicks, a Doctor of
Music, who was well known for very
many years as the organist of Christ
Church, Bradford, England. Of the
union there is a surviving family of
two sons and one daughter.


FRANCIS AVERY COXON,
“Nottingham Downs,” Whitewood,
was born at Barcaldine on December
24, 1891, and is a son of Mr. Francis
Coxon, with whom he is associated
as partner in the ownership of
“Nottingham Downs.” Mr. Coxon,
sen., is a son of the late George
Coxon, who came to Australia from
Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, in the
year 1857 and established the line
which has become so well known in
Western and Northern Queensland
in the persons of his sons and grand-
sons, who have proved themselves
worthy descendants of the fine old
pioneer, two of Mr. Francis Coxon’s
brothers, Messrs. George and J. E.
Coxon, referred to elsewhere in this
work, also holding large pastoral
interests in the State. The founder
of the family was an engineer by
profession and in that capacity
practised at Ballarat and became a
well-known figure at other early gold-
bearing centres in Victoria, his
services being retained by different
mining companies from time to time.
Later he was identified with the
pastoral and agricultural life of the
then Colony on a block of grazing
country near Casterton, whereon he

death he lived in retirement at Port-

family of four sons and four
daughters. The gentleman under
entered the office of Goldsbrough,
Mort & Co., Ltd., in order to receive
a grounding in commercial affairs.
After a period somewhat under two
years spent in the office of the
above-mentioned firm, he returned
to “Fairfield,” a property situated
near Longreach and then in the
possession of his father. Here he
was initiated into all the details of
wool-growing under the capable
tuition of that gentleman, remaining
on “Fairfield” until its disposal.
Subsequently he was occupied on the
various runs which comprised the
paternal acres, becoming in the
meantime thoroughly conversant
with the industry to which, in
emulation of his immediate ancestors
he intended to devote himself, and
in the year 1911 was admitted with
his elder brother, William George,
into partnership by Mr. F. Coxon.
During the recent hostilities, which
from 1914 to 1918 agitated the
civilized world, Mr. W. G. Coxon
became a member of the Australian
Imperial Forces, seeing service
abroad, and on his return to
Australia, retired from the firm in
order to strike out on a separate
enterprise. At time of writing

JAMES MITCHELL, proprietor
of “Windermere,” Winton, and
“Eyriewald,” Corfield, was born at
“Uralla,” near Walcha, New Soutli
Wales, on October 21, 1861, and is
MR. J. MITCHELL.
a son of the late Alexander Mitchell,
who, hailing from his native city of
Glasgow, Scotland, in the middle
sixties, settled at “Uralla,” New
South Wales, where he followed the
calling of a mechanical engineer for
a number of years. Subsequently
he became interested in manufactur-
ing and commercial pursuits, pur-
chasing the Walcha Flour Mill,
which he conducted in conjunction
with a commercial retail busi-
ness, at that time the principal
establishment of its kind in Walcha.
He remained in Walcha until
the final chapter brought to a
close a long and useful career in his
adopted country. Educated at the
Armidale Grammar School under
the headmastership of the late Mr.
Kendal, Mr. James Mitchell con-
cluded his scholastic career when at
the age of nineteen. Compelled by
the strong appeal that vast spaces
of untrodden country ever hold for
natures pre-eminently enterprising,
he decided to devote his future
energies to pastoral life, and as the
first step in a career which he in-
tended should be ultimately crowned
with success, he became one of a
droving party commissioned to
travel a mob of cattle from Walcha
to Muswellbrook. Subsequently he
proceeded to Western Queensland in
order to join Mr. Harry Crawford
(a relative by marriage who now
lives in retirement at Toowoomba) in
a journey to the Northern Territory,
and set out with the latter from
“Westlands,” a grazing area in the
vicinity of Longreach, in the year
1881. However, on reaching “Cork”
Station, near Winton, he abandoned
his original intention, undertaking
instead the duties of head stockman
on the last-named property. He
remained at “Cork” for a period
extending over twelve years, during
which he occupied different positions
of responsibility and accomplished
several droving trips. During the
years in which he was connected
with this station, he was afforded
MR. A. W. MITCHELL.
opportunities of transacting con-
siderable operations as a horse-
dealer, purchasing stock on his own
account in New South Wales and
making satisfactory sales on his
return to Queensland. After sever-
ing his connection with “Cork” in
the year 1893, he continued for a
while as a contract drover, mean-
while conducting further trans-
actions in horses, and it is worthy of
note that, in carrying out these
operations, he reversed his former
procedure by securing his purchases
in Queensland and effecting their
disposal in New South Wales. His
droving operations, both on behalf
of the proprietors of “Cork” Station
and other owners, embrace both
sheep and cattle and took him over
most of the old stock routes of
Queensland and New South Wales,
the different trips often absorbing
lengthy periods of time, during
which his ingenuity and powers of
endurance were constantly taxed
to the utmost. While coping with
the severe conditions attendant
upon floods, droughts, and other
adversities which beset the path of a
pioneer, his devotion to duty was
the factor which, despite successions
of sleepless nights for weeks together,
frequent scarcity of food and water,
and other privations, invariably
resulted in the fulfilment of his con-
tracts to the satisfaction of those
concerned. As a successful drover,
he was widely known, having on
one occasion travelled stock from
“Cooinda” 'Station, near Winton,
to the Gulf country, being a year
on the roads before reaching his
destination; while on another he was
successful in overlanding a big mob
of stock from “Dagworth,” also a
North Gregory Station, to “Millie,”
a pastoral proposition in New South
Wales. When an opportunity offered
by which he was enabled to make a
beginning as a grazier, he selected a
small block of country in the
vicinity of Winton, and at about
the same time became identified
with a butchering business in that
town, both these ventures being yet

In the year 1919 Mr. Mitchell
purchased a notable North Gregory
pastoral run known as “Eyriewald,”
which at one time formed part of
“Katandra” Station, and has since
administered the area through the
medium of his eldest son, Mr.
Alexander W. Mitchell.
“Eyriewald” is composed of
downs, open and undulating in
character, and covers an area of
80,000 acres, which are mainly
watered by wells and dams. A two-
storied homestead occupies a site on

improved in this respect. In regard

timbers providing welcome shelter
for the stock, both from the intense
heat of the summer sun and the
inclement conditions which prevail
from time to time. Mr. Mitchell
has a home in Charters Towers, and
spends his time chiefly between that
centre and his Winton residence. He
is held by his fellow-men in that
esteem which his long, arduous, and
upright career so completely merits;
and it is unanimously acknowledged
by those who, having also borne the
burden of pioneering existence,
judge a man by his record “out
back,” that the success which has
attended the enterprise of “Jimmy
Mitchell,” as he is affectionately
called among his confreres, is the
outcome of those qualities of grit,
honour, and foresight which charac-
terize him. Since his advent to
North Gregory he has devoted a
large share of the leisure at his
command to various movements
instituted pro hono publico. For
some years he has been a member of
the Winton Shire Council. The

He is included in the membership of
the Civic Club, Charters Towers, and
the Winton Club. In 1893 Mr.
Mitchell married Eva, daughter of
the late Thomas Chellingworth, erst-
while a notable identity and one of
the very earliest pastoralists of the
Northern part of the State. He was
the founder of “Ingledon” Station,
in the Gregory district, with which
he was associated for many years.
Of the union there is a family of four
sons and two daughters, the eldest
son, Alexander William, being
engaged in assisting his father in the
administration of “Windermere” and
“Eyriewald.”
ARTHUR HAROLD PAINE,
"Burwood,” Julia Creek, is a native
of the Far West of Queensland, his
birth having occurred at Cloncurry
on December 5, 1886. He is the eldest
son of Mr. Alfred Arthur Paine, a
Queensland pioneer of the late seven-
ties, and a native of the Hunter
River district, New South Wales.
Descended from old English stock,
Mr. A. A. Paine is a son of the late
Captain Paine, the commander of
a merchant vessel which traded be-
tween the Old World and Australia
when this vast continent was in the
initial stages of settlement and only
a small portion of its south-eastern
corner was occupied by white people.
Eventually abandoning the sea, the
late gentleman became one of the
early dwellers of New South Wales,
settling in the vicinity of Maitland,
and here was born to him a large
family, various members of which
have been notably identified with
pastoral settlement in Australia.
Reference to another of his sons, the
late Charles Henry Paine, will be
found elsewhere in this work in a
memoir of the career of Mr. E. P.
Phillott, of “Colane.” Mr. A. A.
Paine arrived in Queensland) at a
period dating more than forty years
back in charge of cattle from the
Hunter River district of the parent
State, which he travelled to- “Fiery
Downs,” a station lying some dis-
tance from Normanton in the Gulf
country. Being most favourably
impressed with the possibilities of
the then Colony, he decided to settle
in the North, eventually centreing
his energies in the district outlying
Ayr, where, for over a quarter of a
century, he has been actively
engaged in grazing and butchering
pursuits. His eldest son, Mr. A. H.
Paine, was educated at the North
Shore Grammar School, Sydney,
terminating his college career at the
age of sixteen and returning to the
parental roof tree. Thenceforward, for
a period of five years, he assisted his
father in his varied operations, the
knowledge of pastoral matters thus
acquired fitting him for any position
involving practical responsibility.
On arriving at years of manhood, and
actuated by the realization that by
launching out on his own account
further useful experience would be
afforded him, he accepted a post on
Tnkerman” Station, then managed
by Mr. James H. Rae, a well-known
MR. A. A. PAINE.
pastoral manager and one of the
pioneers of the industry in Queens-
land, from whose methods he gleaned
much useful knowledge of stock and
land administration. In the year
1910 he started on the roads in
charge of stock, his duties as a drover
during the next few years render-
ing him familiar with the various
routes traversing the Northern and
Western portions of the State, and
with the characteristic features of
the country through which he passed.
After concluding several droving
trips he returned to his father’s pro-
perty, where lie remained for a
period, returning to the Far West in
1914, in which year he was success-
ful in securing by ballot the country
on which he later erected his home,
a structure which well deserves
description as one of the prettiest
and most modern homesteads of the
district. Situated some twenty miles
from Julia Creek and at a distance
of sixteen miles from Quarrell
Siding, the' point of railway com-
munication which is used by Mr.
Paine and his household, the dwell-
ing occupies a site in near vicinity
to the artesian bore which waters
the property and garden, irrigating
the fruit, shade and other ornamen-
tal trees and shrubs, which, planted
at a comparatively recent date, pro-
mise to make the home surroundings
a veritable oasis in the near future.
The holding was formerly included
in the area resumed from “Manfred
Downs,” being designated “Bur-
wood” on coming into Mr. Paine’s
possession. It consists of 20,000
acres of good grazing land, the
nature of which is indicated by
nicely sheltered Mitchell and Flind-
ers grass plains, the timbers carried
being principally mimosa, white-
wood, vinetree, and bauhinia, though
several other species of scrub, which
have proved of considerable value as
fodder in drought time, are largely
in evidence. On taking over the
property, Mr. Paine immediately
entered upon its further develop-
ment, the five years of persevering
industry which he has devoted to it
having already left their mark on
what is now one of the snuggest
little concerns of its size in the West.
The run has been subdivided into
five paddocks, the largest of which
has an area of 12,000 acres, two
embracing 3,000, one 400, and the
other the home paddock 200
acres. Devoted to the wool-growing
industry, its flock was founded on a
nucleus of “Manfred Downs” ewes
with rams from “Bungaree,” the
blood being kept fresh by yearly
importations from this noted South
Australian stud. Mr. Paine married
in the year 1920 Norah, daughter
of Mr. O’Donoghue, one of a group
of pioneers who were associated with
the early development of Charters
Towers, this gentleman having fol-
lowed the mining industry in Queens-
land for well over a quarter of a
century, and, though denied that
brilliant rise to fortune which has
rewarded its more fortunate devotees,
has, none the less, like so many of
his countrymen, by worthy effort
contributed in no small way to the
making of history in the outback
spaces of his adopted country.


The late HONOURABLE JOHN
MURRAY. A work of the kind em-
bodied within these pages would be
incomplete without mention of
the pioneer whose name is most not-
ably and worthily perpetuated in
annals relating to the pastoral, poli-
tical and commercial history of the
State and whose career it is our pre-
sent privilege to outline. Of nation-
ality that has impressed itself on the
tablets of colonizing history wher-
ever the British flag has been raised,
the late Honourable John Murray
was born in Ayrshire on July 16,
1841, and journeyed with his people
from Scotland to the rough though
stirring environment of the Victor-
ian goldfields when in his eleventh
year. H ere he was in the midst of
scenes full of interest, for the his-
tory of mining in Australia had only
just begun and the hearts and minds
of the population were stirred with
the tremendous and fascinating pos-
sibilities of the diggings, which were
then the home of every class, type
and nationality. Fortunes were made
in a day by fabulous discoveries and
those to whom wealth was new spent
profusely and wantonly while others
toiled vainly for the ever-deferred
smile of Fortune. The year 1852
witnessed the arrival with his people
of Mr. Murray in Australia, where,
as he advanced in years, he became

attaining his twenty-first year. Even
at this early age the initiative and
foresight which, later, made him
in conjunction with his brothers,
Messrs. Tom and Campbell Murray,
shipping large numbers of cattle to
the Dominion, and their undertaking
proved most successful until brought
to an end by the prohibition of the
New Zealand Government of the
importation of stock to that country
owing to an outbreak of pleuro-
pneumonia among Australian herds.
The decision of the Dominion
authorities caused a turn in the tide
of his affairs that was in the nature
of a very severe setback—probably
his first experience of the grave anxi-
eties and recurring adversities with
which the path of the pastoralist is
beset—and be was faced with the
necessity of making a fresh start and
regaining the ground which he had
lost. Thus was Fortune instrumental
in guiding him towards his long
future association with the story of
pastoral and political progress in
Queensland. Realizing, with a full
appreciation of the difficulties and
obstacles which here might await
him, the great possibilities of the
youngest of the Australian Colonies,
and possessed of the mental and
physical fitness which hard work,
hard fare, and a life in the open
equips a young man of robust consti-
tution, he was just the type Queens-
land so greatly needed in those early
years of her independence for the
more and more fully occupied with
the calling with which Fate had
made him familiar in boyhood. That

organized was a scheme for the mar-

empty spaces constituting the greater
part of her territory. His decision to
try his fortune here was made in
1864, in which year he arrived in
Brisbane. With the promptness and

At his death, which occurred at

figures prominently in the pastoral
life of Central and North-Western
Queensland. It consists of Messrs.
Andrew John Baxter, Hugh and
Fergus, who are also the executors
of the estate of the late George
McMaster, who was one of the mem-
bers of the firm at the time of his
death. The family was founded in
Australia by the late William
McMaster, who was born in Wigton-
shire, Scotland. The name of
McMaster in Wigtonshire has for
several generations been connected
with the old farms of “Challoch,”
“Tonnachrae,” “Clayshant,” “Blair
Sorrie,” and “Windmill,” the last-
mentioned being the birthplace of
William McMaster. The original

farms. The late William McMaster
embarked at Liverpool, England, for
Australia in a sailing vessel in 1854.
He arrived in Australia after a
voyage of six months’ duration, being
then in his early twenties. Shortly
after landing he engaged in farming
pursuits and secured the position of
manager of an agrarian proposition
near Geelong on behalf of an old
pioneering family named Armstrong.
After a time he rented this farm and
specialized in wheat farming for
some years, eventually meeting with
total failure owing to the outbreak of
“rust” in the wheat crops, which
brought ruin to all the wheat growers
in that particular district. This
disease (wheat rust) proved a serious
matter for Victoria at that time,
financially disabling a large number
of farmers. The late William
McMaster’s reverses having reduced

followed to Central Queensland by
his wife and young family. William
McMaster left Mr. Macdonald to go
to Canoona goldfield. Like many
others who sought fortune on the
goldfields, he discovered that the
realities of mining too often fall short
of the glittering possibilities, but
persevering in the hope that good
fortune would com© his way, he
followed the various gold rushes of
the day, roughing it with the best
and managing to make a living for
his family. In the course of his stren-
uous calling he went to Morinish,

family of farmers. Mrs. McMaster,
whose maiden name was Scott, was
born in Perthshire, and sailed with
her father and other members of her
family for Australia in 1854 in the
ill-fated sailing clipper the “Marco
Pola,” noted as one of the fastest
boats of her day. The “Marco Pola”
was wrecked in 1855. Mrs.
McMaster’s father failed to reach
Australia, his death eventuating on
the voyage. Jessie Scott, in con-
sequence of this bereavement, spent
her girlhood in the home of her
to realize how far-reaching the work
has been and the effect of the
example. Mrs. McMaster now re-
sides in Rockhampton. Both her
daughters are married, one to Mr.
James Kerr, of Rockhampton, and
the other to Mr. Alexander Duncan,
a member of an old pioneering family
of the Rockhampton district. Mr.
Andrew John Baxter McMaster, her
eldest son, is the senior partner of
the firm of McMaster Brothers. Born
near Geelong, Victoria, on duly 25,
1861, he was educated by his father
and was still a child when the family

near Rockhampton, where, making
a home, he became interested in
cattle-raising and also continued his
mining career, eventually becoming
managing partner in the Welcome
Gold Mining Co., one of the largest
mining shows in that centre. It was
in this mine that, in 1885, he with
three others met their death as the
result of a mining accident caused
through a shot fired breaking
through into some old workings,
which flooded the shaft in which they
were working, drowning all four.
His widow, who still survives him,

Geelong district of Victoria, and it
was here that she and William
McMaster met and their marriage
took place in 1860. The life of Mrs.
McMaster can be looked upon as a
full measure of industry, love,
loyalty, and self-sacrifice, and with
justice, should it appeal to her to do
so, she with those other splendid
women of her day, who braved hard-
ship and did their part in the
pioneering work of Australia, can
feel that life has not been wasted or

natural aptitude for study, he
eagerly consumed the contents of
what books he could procure, becom-

development and progress of the
districts in which he has lived have
ever had for him a deep interest, and
all bodies instituted to this end have
received his whole-hearted co-opera-
tion. For more than twenty years
he has been a councillor of the Win-

ol that position for a number of
years. He has recently been elected
as president of the Graziers’ Asso-
ciation of Central and Northern
Queensland, and vice-president of
the United Graziers’ and Pastoral-
ists Association. He also for a
time was a member of the
Aramac Shire Council, and was

Villers Bretonneux in France on
May 20, 1918, when at the age of
forty-four years. His widow and his
three children reside in Sandgate,
near Brisbane. The late George

his death, and in that connection
engaged in the management of

ing positions which he holds, amongst
these being the chairmanship of the

their qualities of citizenship and all
partake fully of the responsibilities


of public life. From the date on
which the late William McMaste',
sen., made his advent to Morinish,
the family’s sojourn in that district
covered a period verging on twenty
years, during the whole of which
they were associated with the mining
and pastoral industries of the dis-
trict. Leaving the Rockhampton
district with the intention of taking
up pastoral pursuits only, they pro-
ceeded to Western Queensland, where
the brothers selected two blocks
of country comprising 20,000 acres
on “Wellshot” Station resumption,
completed a considerable amount
of developmental work on the area.
Two adjoining blocks, named “Si-
beria” and “Moscow,” resumptions
of “Evesham” holding, were also
selected during the existence of the
original firm and are still included in
the ownership of McMaster Brothers.
Some time after the acquirement of
the last-mentioned blocks an adjoin-
ing leasehold property named
“Edkinstone” was purchased and
amalgamated with “Moscow” and
“Siberia,” the three blocks, which

were thrown open for selection in
1901, a year during which only one

parts of the district, the country
being then in the throes of the great
drought which held parts of the State
in its grip for practically seven years,

which were consolidated into a
holding named “Kelso.” Later, in
1896, they secured 40,000 acres form-
ing portion of the resumption of
“Oondooroo,” and this holding they
named “Leswalt.” They owned
“Kelso” and “Leswalt” for several
years, but eventually, in 1910, a
mutual arrangement was arrived at
by which Thomas severed his con-
nection with the firm and retained
the ownership of “Kelso.” The other
members of the family continued to
hold “Leswalt” until 1912, when
they disposed of it, after having

in the three blocks is highly
developed and carries some 70,000
sheep and about 400 shorthorn stud

Messrs. McMaster were the sole
applicants for the 70,000 acre block
which comprises “Moscow” when

Of the 429,120,000 acres representing the area ot
the State, the largest extent is comprised in Northern
Queensland, which has an acreage of 158,425,600, ox-
-247,540 square miles. Northern Queensland proper
begins on the east coast at Cape Palmerston, 25 miles
from Mackay or 35 miles north of the 22nd parallel of
latitude, and zig-zags west from there in a somewhat
erratic fashion until it ends along the 21st parallel on
the boundary of the Northern Territory in a direct line
with Lake Nash.
Apart from the small creeks on the heads of the
Flinders and the Cloncurry, the whole watershed of all
the Gulf rivers is in Northern Queensland, and all the
principal waters of the Burdekin. The most important
river is the Burdekin, which drains an area of 53,529
square miles.
The North takes in most of the sugar country ot
Queensland, including Mackay, Proserpine, the Burde-
kin, Herbert, Johnstone, Bussell, and Mulgrave River
areas. Whilst on the Gulf watershed are the mines of
the Woolgar, Gilbert, Etheridge, Mungana, Tinaroo,
Chillagoe, the old Palmer goldfields, Ebagoolah, and all
the great mines of the Cloncurry district.
According to official information the following were

situated on the south bank of the Pioneer River, four
miles from its mouth and connected by rail with Bris-
bane, from which it is distant 598 miles. The highest
part of Mackay is not more than 10 feet above sea-level.
Originally the site was covered by a belt of dense scrub,
behind which stretched to the spurs of the coast range
a vast area of virgin country, level and open, and tim-
bered with ironbark, bloodwood, Moreton Bay ash and
clumps of very large tea-trees, and chiefly characterized
by rich black soil flats, and in a minor degree, patches
of melon-hole or “devil devil” country.
The Pioneer was discovered by the late Captain
John Mackay (who died when occupying the position of
Port Master at Brisbane), and was originally named
after him, its present designation having been bestowed
in 1862 by Commodore Burnett of H.M.S. “Pioneer,”
who had previously given the name “Mackay” to a small
river running into Rockingham Bay.
Cattle stations had been formed to the north, south,
and west of the locality some little time before the dis-
covery of the river by Captain Mackay, who, with the
objective of finding new pastoral country, left Armidale,
New South Wales, with a party of six white men and an
aboriginal, in due course reaching Rockhampton,
whence on March 16, 1860, he set out on the difficult
and perilous journey of exploration which brought him
two months later within sight of the river, to the mouth
of which he penetrated on May 23 of the same year.
The earliest settlement of the Pioneer watershed was
effected on January 7, 1862, under the leadership of
Captain Mackay, who then, with 1,200 head of cattle,
50 horses and two bullock teams, and accompanied by
10 others—stock hands, bullock drivers, carpenter, cook,
and two aborigines—completed his second journey from
Armidale and began the formation ox “Greenrnount,”
the station site chosen nearly 20 months previously.
For five months these earliest settlers waited here for
the arrival of the cutter “Presto,” expected on the new-
found river with supplies from Rockhampton.
The first vessel to navigate the Pioneer was the
cutter, “Presto,” which brought Captain Mackay’s sup-
plies on June 29, 1862. Following her came the “Mur-
ray,’ Captain Tills, which had only two passengers,
Mr. and Mrs. Bolger. The latter was the first white
woman to land on the site of Mackay, which, though
surveyed as a township a short time previously, then
showed not the least indication of settlement. The
couple, bound for “The Retreat” Station, were met at
the landing edging the mangrove scrub, which then con-
stituted the township, by two New England blackboys,
who had brought a team of bullocks and four horses for
the conveyance of supplies from the vessel, and under
whose escort they reached “Greenrnount,” 11 miles out,
where they met Mr. and Mrs. James Ready, the latter,
who came overland with her husband at the time of tiro
formation of Mount Spencer ’ Station in the same year
(1862), being the first white woman in the Mackay dis-
trict.
After Lieutenant Heath’s marine survey, Mackay
was gazetted a port of entry, and the first Post Office was
opened on January 9, 1863.


Previous to the sugar era, Mackay was almost
entirely dependent on the cattle and sheep stations on
the coast side of the range and at the heads of the
Isaacs and Burdekin Rivers for its existence, the wool
from the sheep stations (which were afterwards con-
verted into cattle stations on account of the grass seeds)
being shipped south from the port.
The late T. H. Fitz Gerald, who with Mr. Spiller
was a pioneer of the sugar industry in the district, sur-
veyed a road over the range in 1864 ? though Mr. James
Ready had brought a dray down during the previous
year to take stores back from the “Presto” to “Mount
In 1866 came the first newspaper, The Mercury ,
originally published by Mr. W. O. Hodgkinson, who
had been a member of the Burke and Wills expedition,
in after years occupying the portfolio of Minister for
Education in the Griffith Administration.
Mackay has contributed four Cabinet Ministers to
the State—Messrs. Dalrymple, Chataway, Paget and
Hume Black—and most notably to the world’s history
of song, for the famous prima donna, Madame Melba,
as Nellie Armstrong, wife of Mr. G. Armstrong, of
“The Hollow,’’ was for a considerable portion of her
girlhood a resident here.
VICTORIA STREET, MACKAY.
Spencer” Station on the tableland. Traffic to and from
Mackay extended even to the Peak Downs, and west to
"Mount Cornish” and "Bowen Downs” Stations. The
district’s possibilities in the direction of the sugar indus-
try were first tested in the year 1865, when Mr. John
Spiller planted the original crop of cane, his enterprise
being shortly followed on a much larger scale by Mr. T.
H. Fitz Gerald, under whose auspices was erected the
first successful mill, the Alexandra, which crushed 110
tons of sugar in 1868. Mr. Spiller, while the first small
crop of cane was maturing, successfully grew maize, and
experimented in cotton culture.
Possessed of an extremely healthy climate, the town
is swept on the east by the sea breeze, and on the west by
the winds from a tableland only 40 miles away and over
2,000 feet in height. In summer the thermometer rises
to 95 degrees, falling to 32 degrees in June and July.
At various stages of its history Mackay has experi-
enced abnormal rainfalls, 50 inches being recorded for
March, 1882, 10| inches in 24 hours in January, 1884,
and 80 inches for January, 1918.
The following figures will serve to illustrate the ex-
pansion of the sugar industry in the district from the
date of its inception here. Five months were required


in 1868 to make the first 110 tons of sugar at the Alex-
andra Mill of Messrs. Fitz-Gerald and Davidson.
Thirteen years afterwards the mills of the district pro-
duced 10,000 tons for the year, and in 1922, something
more than half a century from the time of the first
crushing, 361,230 tons of cane were crushed and
44,933 tons of sugar manufactured by the eight mills
in the district, representing a value of £1,344,000.
Though the figures given as the 1922 output of
sugar for the Mackay district speak volumes for the pro-
gress of the industry, they do not fully demonstrate the
possibilities of this part of the State, which still includes
an uncultivated area of vast extent that is capable of
growing sugar or any other tropical product, and in
1921, among other crops raised in the district were;
Grapes, 1,873 lb.; bananas, 10,954 bunches; pineapples,
1,271 dozen; oranges, 5,120 bushels; and mangoes,
4,953 bushels; while on the top of the range to which
the cultivated sugar area extends, is a magnificent table-
land possessing rich soil, a reliable rainfall, and a perfect
climate. A railway, on either side of which is visible
very beautiful scenery, runs to Netherdale, at the foot
of the range, and a road 3| miles in length on a gradient
1 in 9 and costing £IB,OOO, facilitates the ascent. The
Eungella Plateau is between 2,000 and 3,000 feet above
the sea and famous for its soil, splendid timbers, copious
water supply and mineral resources.
Included among the mining centres of Mackay dis-
trict are Mount Flora and Mount Orchard, where the
first indications of copper were found in 1872 by three
shearers named Orange, McGrain and McFadzean.
In 1880 the Mount Britton goldfield, now practically
abandoned, was discovered by a Mr. James Heenan, and
the population of the field rapidly rose to 1,100. Here
nuggets of 80 oz. and 84 oz. were found, and crushings
yielded 7 oz. to the ton. The Eungella goldfield, dis-
covered in 1889 by William Walsh, who opened the
Lady Norman reef and the Orchid reef, gave 118 oz. of
gold from 3 tons of stone.
Connected by rail with the capital and on comple-
tion of the Great North Coast line having direct com-
munication with Cairns, the shallowness of the Pioneer
and the poor harbour facilities offer a serious drawback
to this progressive town, and inconvenience to the vast
trade of so important a district.
The population of the town is given as 6,350, and
including the district, about 15,000.
BOWEN
lies 645 miles- north of Brisbane and overlooks a commo-
dious harbour that was discovered by Captain Daniel
Sinclair on October 17, 1859. The vessel, which sailed
from Rockhampton up the coast as far as Upstart Bay,
was fitted out at private expense and carried in addition
to her Captain, a seaman named William Thomas and
two gentlemen desirous of finding pastoral country
James Gordon and Benjamin Poole. On her return
journey, Port Denison was discovered and named after
Sir William Denison, then Governor of New South Wales.
Arriving in Rockhampton on October 31, a little more
than a month before Queensland was granted a separate
constitution, he immediately reported to the Govern-
ment of New South Wales the existence of an excep-
tional site for a northern port, but as the Separation
movement was so far advanced, no step was taken in
New South Wales beyond the recommendation that he
should refer the matter to authorities in Queensland.
In 1860 Sir George Bowen, after whom the town site
on Port Denison was subsequently named, sanctioned an
official investigation of the locality, the outcome of which
was that the “Jeannie Dove,” carrying Government-
Surveyor Clarendon Stuart and —as prospective settlers
—Mr. and Mrs. Donald Bell and family, Mr. J. Brown,
Mr. and Mrs. E. Fitzalan and family, Messrs. D. Ander-
son, H. Stone, T. Watkins, P. Craigie and H. Muller,
was despatched to Bowen waters, where she arrived on
March 29, 1861. Pending the arrival of an overland
party led by Commissioner George Elphinstone Dal-
rymple, who officially established the town on April 12,
1861, the “Jeannie Dove” landed her passengers at
Stone Island in the harbour.
Bowen, lying in a vast amphitheatre of hills and
mountains, stands on a dome-shaped ridge drained so
perfectly in all directions that it can never be affected
by floods. Its harbour, encircling green-clad isles and
white beaches, is one of the finest and most picturesque
in Australia, and being securely land-locked, ensures
shipping against disturbances from heavy seas and gales
Between Gloucester Island—a notable feature of the
landscape—and the mainland is a half-mile-wide pass.
Midway in this channel lies a smaller island, on one side
of which, descending to the shore, is a splendid range,
and on the other, the giant mass of Gloucester rising in
great spurs and dark ravines to the towering summit of
2,000 feet. In the south-east corner of the harbour,
Ben Lomond rises abruptly from the water in a colossal
pyramid. This mountain, 1,200 feet in height, is
composed of very superior limestone, and a company has
been formed to work the exhaustless quarry.
Behind Ben Lomond is the Gregory River, navi-
gable for small craft for about eight miles. At the
foot of the mount is Sinclair Bay, the first anchorage
of the “Santa Barbara.”
In the centre of the main harbour entrance is
Middle Island. On the south side, Poole Island (named
after another of the “Santa Barbara” party) and Ade-
laide Point are notable landmarks. Adelaide Point is
nine miles by road from Bowen, and is named after the
wife of the late J. G. Macdonald who resided here.


The great natural advantages of the town singled it
out in the early days as the future chief port of the
North, and though overshadowed by the more recently
formed Townsville, few Queensland towns have a more
promising destiny than is prophesied for Bowen.
Great overseas vessels may be berthed at its jetty,
a substantial structure 2,800 feet in length providing
wharfage for five steamers at one time and the whole
length of which is railed from the Bowen station.
Originally entirely composed of wood (its first pile was
driven in the year 1865) improvements were effected
from time to time, and about 10 years ago the old
wharves were replaced by ferro concrete erections.
The swinging basin at the jetty is 1,000 feet wide
and dredged to 18 feet as is the entrance channel, which
is 3,500 feet by 200 feet
The importance to the State of these coalfields, for their
inexhaustible supplies, easy access, and exceptional
facilities for transport, can hardly be exaggerated.
Gold, silver, copper, lead and bismuth are also found,
and the Mount Elliott Company has a smelter in the
district to treat the ores. State Brick Works are well
established on the Bowen River Coalfields.
The big pastoral holdings for which Bowen is the
centre resulted many years ago in the establishment at
Pool© Island of meat works which now have a site at
Merinda, five miles from the port, where extensive
operations in frozen and canned meats, hides, tallow, oil,
manure, and fertilizers are carried on. These products,
with sugar, citrus fruits, and tomatoes, comprise the
chief exports of the town.
Favoured with one of the healthiest climates in the
BOWEN JETTY.
Bowen is served by a branch of the Great Northern
Railway extending south to Proserpine, whence some
40 miles remain to be linked up with Mackay, the pre-
sent terminal point of the Great North Coast line which
will shortly connect Bowen with Brisbane.
It is the centre for a rich pastoral, agricultural,
and mineral area that for the past 30 years has been
favoured with an annual rainfall averaging 404 inches,
having experienced during the above period only three
drought years, namely, 1902, 1912, and 1915.
Among the greatest of the district’s assets are its
immense coal measures lying about 50 miles south of
the town, where huge quantities of exceptional quality
coal are in sight. The industry is now on a sound foot-
ing, the State Coal Mine and the Bowen Consolidated
Company’s Mine being connected by rail with Bowen.
world, Bowen has an excellent water supply that is
pumped from the sandbeds of the Don River into a
reservoir on a low hill near the town, which is excellently
laid out into streets two chains in width.
In 1864 the municipality was proclaimed with Mr.
Francis Clarke as the earliest Mayor.
The publication of the first newspaper, The Fort
Denison Times, by Mr. F. T. Raynor, dated from March
5, 1864.
Mr. Phillip Pinnock was the first Police Magistrate
of Bowen, Captain Sinclair of the “Santa Barbara” was
the first Harbour Master, and Mr. James Gordon the
first Sub-collector of Customs of the port.
The population, about 2,200, is small when the
natural advantages of the town are considered.
From Bowen south, the railway terminating at


Proserpine, 40 miles away, runs through a fertile sugar-
growing district. This railway, which was opened on
July 2, 1910, by the late Sir William MacGregor, cost
£106,000.
PROSERPINE
little more than 20 years ago was unbroken scrub and
forest. The stream from which it is named was discovered
by Mr. George Elphinstone Dalrymple on his first over-
land trip from Rockhampton to Bowen in 1861. The fer-
tility of its district is shown in the fact that in 1921 the
area under sugar-cane was 5,673 acres, and 55,917 tons of
cane, producing 7,597 tons of sugar, were crushed at the
Central Mill.
Many other streams besides the Proserpine intersect
the vast agricultural area of which the town is the
centre, including the Gregory, Andromache, and
O’Connell Rivers, and Goorganga and Kelsey Creeks;
and in addition to cane, pineapples, oranges, mangoes,
and bananas are largely produced. Maize and cigar-leaf
culture also l receive considerable attention, 2,572 lb. of
dried leaf being produced in 1921.
In the deep holes of the rivers and creeks is common
the large crocodile (Crocodihis Peresns), a circumstance
which calls for vigilance in proximity to the waterways.
The population including the district is now about
3,000, and the town is laid out into wide streets, and
possesses good climatic conditions with a rainfall averag-
ing 75 inches annually.
TOWNSVILLE.
Approaching Cape Cleveland, 14 miles from Towns-
ville, from the south by sea, away to the eastward may
be seen Salamander Reef, on which struck the warship
after which the reef is named. On the Cape itself now
stands a lighthouse at an elevation of 35 feet, its light
being visible for 20 miles. As the steamer travels direct
across Cleveland Bay to the town, Magnetic Island (the
“Magnetical Isle” discovered by Captain Cook in 1770),
composed entirely of granite with hills rising to 1,700
feet, is passed. Away to the south is the low coast which
extends across the Burdekin Delta to Bowen. In the dis-
tance is the magnificent Mount Elliott rising over 4,000
feet and densely wooded to the summit. To the west is
the long sloping table top of Mount Stuart, and beyond
are the fantastic and picturesque summits of the coast
range.
Some idea of the importance of the cosy little artifi-
cial harbour will be gathered when it is mentioned that
for the year ending June, 1922, the oversea imports
amounted to £431,133, and the oversea exports totalled
£1,231,361; 740 vessels with a tonnage of 918,516
entered, and 742 vessels representing a. tonnage of
924,634 cleared. To illustrate what has been accom-
plished in the direction of making this harbour, it is
mentioned that trading with Townsville, regularly or at
intervals, are more than 25 different steamship lines
whose vessels not many years ago would have had to lie
off two or three miles in the middle of the Bay, but are
now able to berth at the Harbour Board’s wharves where
there is a depth of 24 feet of water.
Mr. John Melton Black, as general manager of the
Upper Burdekin stations owned by Captain Robert
Towns, after whom the town is named, was responsible
for the foundation of Townsville. Under instructions
from Mr. Black, Messrs. Andrew Ball and M. Reid ex-
plored the coast northward for a suitable site for a port.
The discovery of Ross Creek and Ross River was the
result. On receiving Mr. Ball’s report, Mr. Black sent
a party of men under Mr. G. S. Rowe to erect on the
site the buildings required, and shortly following this
party, had erected the first house on Melton Hill with
timber sawn from big tea-trees on the edge of a lagoon,
there being no other timber of any value.
To clear and make a road from Melton Hill through
the impenetrable mangrove scrub on the muddy fore-
shores of Ross Creek, to blast rocks, and build a wharf
on the bank of the creek was the next work undertaken
by Mr. Black, who had actually laid off the eastern end
of the town before the Government Surveyor, Mr.
Stuart, arrived.
The initiative of Captain Towns (who also intro-
duced kanakas to Ross Island to grow cotton —a venture
which proved unsuccessful) was responsible for the estab-
lishment of boiling-down works on the Ross River, now
the site of meat works that employ 700 to 800 men in
the season from April to November.
Besides the Ross River Meatworks, there are in the
locality the Alligator Creek Meatworks, lying 12 miles
from the town by road and eight miles by water. These
were established over 40 years ago by the late William
Hann of “Maryvale,” and A. W. D. White of “Bluff
Downs,” who were joined by Sir Robert Fhilp and
others. To-day these works have a splendid plant, equal
to any in Australia, the proprietors owning 8,000 acres
of freehold. All their products are shipped at Towns-
ville, which is also the port for the Burdekin and Torrens
Creek Meatworks.
Townsville receives traffic from over 1,000 miles of
railway, the cost of construction of which was nearly
£5,000,000, and is the outlet for all the trade from
Ravenswood, Charters Towers, the Northern Territory,
and the pastoral country west of Winton. Its princi-
pal exports include frozen and tinned meats, scoured and
greasy wool, hides, livestock, ores and concentrates, and
sugar.
On October 10, 1865, Townsville was proclaimed a
port of entry. The town became a. municipality on
February 16, 1866, and to-day has a population of
22,000.


The city is supplied with gas and electric light.
It has a fine General Hospital with an extensive labora-
tory for the special study of tropical diseases, and here
much has been accomplished by the scientist. Educa-
tional facilities provide amply for the growing popula-
tion, for there are no less than six State Schools, a Gram-
mar School, six Private Schools and Colleges, a Technical
College, and a School of Arts. Among the buildings of
note are the Custom House, Post and Telegraph Offices,
and Central Railway Station.
favourite of these to the Townsville lesidents is Magnetic
Island, which as a sanatorium has few rivals.
The first sod of the railway westward was turned in
February, 1879, and the first section of 34 miles to the
Reid River was opened on December 20, 1880.
Fifty miles southward from Townsville on the rail-
way terminating at Proserpine, south of Bowen, is
AYR,
the chief sugar centre of the Burdekin.
TOWNSVILLE, FROM MELTON HILL.
The maximum summer temperature of Townsville
is 85 degrees and the minimum 73, while in the winter
months the thermometer varies from 73 to 78 degrees,
and occasionally, from 63 to 69 degrees.
Severe cyclonic disturbances have been experienced
here, one having occurred in 1867, another in 1870, and
a third, “Sigma,” 26 years later. “Sigma” was fol-
lowed by “Leonta” early in the present century, when
considerable damage was wrought in the town.
Within easy distance of the centre of traffic are many
beauty spots, and fine watering places. Perhaps the
v
The railway skirts the base of a jungle-clad moun-
tain over 4,000 feet in height, runs along the borders of
great swamps and lily-covered lagoons swarming with
wild fowl, and past picturesque fields, the highest point
being only 37 feet above the sea. Here and there are
seen stately, solemn, voiceless Jabirus, and hundreds
of Native Companions so tame and fearless that they
frequently come within 15 or 20 yards of the train, from
which a splendid view of bird life is obtained. After-
leaving lownsville and passing a State Experimental
farm, the first stopping-place is Stewart’s Creek, where


there is a large brick works, and one of the best-
appointed gaols in the State. Twelve miles from the
port is Nome, where meat from Alligator Creek is
loaded for Townsville. Three miles farther on is the
Alligator Creek Siding, where the stock for the meat-
works are detrained. Numerous small stations and sid-
ings occur ere finally, some six miles from Ayr, tiie
Pioneer Mill, and great fields of cane which supply it,
come boldly into view. Three miles beyond the Mill is
Brandon, a thriving town possessing three churches, a
Convent School for boarders and day scholars, several
good shops and hotels, and surrounded by cane farms.
Adjoining Brandon is Ayr, the head centre of the
great Burdekin Delta, and lying in the midst of one of
the finest sugar-growing areas in Australia, an area pos-
sessing uniformly good alluvial soil, and, within a few
feet of its service and in scores of deep surface lagoons,
an exhaustless water supply capable of irrigating the
whole Delta were it necessary. The area already irri-
gated has given the most satisfactory results.
Ayr is a most progressive and up-to-date town, as
evidenced by its press, its technical classes, its electric
lighting system, water supply, telephone exchange, and
other requirements. Seven miles beyond its site is Home
Hill, a thriving township by the Inkcnnan Mill, and
surrounded by cane farms.
A large number of settlers have taken land on the
Burdekin in recent years, especially on the Inkerman
1 Estate, which was purchased and cut up by the Govern-
ment. Irrigation is extensively adopted to ensure crops
in the occasional droughts. There are three large sugar
mills in the district—the Kalamia, Pioneer, and Inker-
man, the last mentioned being one of the most complete
in the State.
RAVENSWOOD,
lying 78 miles from Townsville, is the terminus of a line
branching from the Great Northern Railway, which
takes the traveller through level country timbered with
poplar gums and dwarf ironbark, and showing on either
hand hilly or mountainous scenery until Reid River
Station is reached. Thence over flats to broken country
and on through forests of pandanus, bloodwood, and
poplar gums to a wilderness of stunted ironbarks which
continue over a granite range to Ravenswood Junction.
This is a busy little village, being the depot for all
passengers to and from Ravenswood and the surrounding
country. The distance from the junction to Ravenswood
is 24 miles, and the railway runs into rough ranges
before arriving at the town, which is picturesquely sit-
uated within a circle of hills in a fine high and dry
position about 1,000 feet above sea level. The site is
of granite formation on the heads of small creeks
running into the Burdekin, and was established as a
mining field about 1868.
Ravenswood has two distinct systems of reefs, one
north and south underlying to the east, and the other
east and west underlying to the south; and has always
been characterized by a preponderance of refractory ores,
which, in addition to gold, contain iron and copper
pyrites, arsenical pyrites, zinc blend, and galena. The
alluvial gold got by the early miners came from the
decomposition of such of this complex mundic ore as had
been exposed to water and the atmosphere, and was first
found in 1868 by Messrs. Jessop, Buchanan, and party,
whose operations were assisted by Messrs. Carr, Curr, and
Cunningham, the holders of the run on which the gold
was found. Work was started at Middle Camp, and
prospectors went on to Plum-tree Creek, and by 1879 the
workings had extended to Connelly’s Creek, Nolan’s and
Jessop’s Gullies, and finally to the Top Camp, the pre-
sent site of Ravenswood.
The first crushing machine on Ravenswood was
erected by Mr. W. O. Hodgkinson at Burnt Point in
1870, and the first 450 tons of stone gave 1,983 oz. of
gold.
There is a great silver-bearing area extending six
miles north-west from the centres of the goldfield, and
for the seven years spread over 1880-7, 5,000 tons of
silver ore gave silver to the value of £131,000.
From Ravenswood Junction to
CHARTERS TOWERS
fine open undulating country lightly timbered with
bloodwood and ironbark is traversed to Fanning, a
pleasant station in open forest, and on to Macrossan, at
the Burdekin high-level bridge, which is 90 feet above
the water, and replaced the old low-level railway bridge,
used now only for vehicle and foot traffic. Here there
is an excellent hotel, which is a favourite week-end
resort and a kind of sanatorium for people from
Charters Towers. Higher up the river from this point
is a weir where the water supply for Charters Towers is
conserved.
The beginning of Charters Towers dates from the
latter part of 1871, when three prospectors, George
Clarke, Hugh Mossman, and Donald Fraser, prospect-
ing on the Upper Burdekin, decided, ere leaving a dis-
trict that had hitherto but scantily rewarded their
efforts, to try their luck in a locality marked by some
little peaks silhouetted against the sunset, and visible
away back of their camp Next day they were rewarded
by the discovery at the base of these peaks, of masses of
gold-bearing quartz and several of the reefs which after-
wards made the goldfield’s fame.
The miners spoke of these reefs as “tors,” and thus,


with the addition of the name of the warden who pro-
claimed the goldfield, originated the name of Charters
Tors, which soon came to be spoken of as Charters
Towers.
A township rapidly sprang up on the site, companies
were formed, and capital poured in from Brisbane,
Sydney, and Melbourne, and in the five years following
the discovery of the first gold, 500,000 oz. of the metal
were obtained, whilst the gold and other minerals won
up to 1922 represent a total value of £28,500,000.
Its altitude of over 1,000 feet above the sea, gives
Charters Towers a healthy climate, and uniformly cool
nights. The average rainfall is 28 inches.
Education occupies a high place in the town’s activi-
ties, there being a High School, a School of Mines, a
Towers, onwards, several small stations are passed before
the train stops at Homestead, built on an ironbark flat,
and disclosing a range of low hills in the distance. On
the way to this township are passed tributaries of the
Cape River, which runs into the Burdekin. Homestead
has a Government sawmill, and nearly all the sleepers for
new extensions come from here. Pentland, a stopping
place a little further on, was the depot for the Cape
River goldfield, and stands at a height of 1,318 feet
above the sea. The Cape River has a broad and sandy
bed bordered by swamp oaks. The diggings situated at
its head, and to which it gave its name, once responded
to the throbbing life of a busy population, 900
Europeans and 100 Chinese having been engaged there
in 1867.

Christian Brothers’ School and College, besides State,
Private and Convent Schools.
Incorporated in 1877, declared a city in 1909,
Charters Towers has a population of 9,500, and covers an
area of 640 acres. Mr. John McDonald was the first
Mayor.
HUGHENDEN,
situated 1,072 feet above the sea and possessing a joer-
fect climate, is built on open rolling downs near the
bank of the Flinders Biver, which was discovered by
Lieutenant Stokes of the “Beagle” on July 30, 1841.
It is reached by the Great Northern line connect-
ing Townsville with Cloncurry, and from Charters

From Pentland the line rises to 1,817 feet at Burra,
on the summit of the range which divides the eastern
and western waters, and parts the waters of three river
systems running to three points of the compass. Here
have their beginning the streams which flow down the
Burdekin to the Pacific, near Cape Cleveland, those
which reach the Flinders and the Gulf, and others which
arrive at the Thomson and Coopers Creek and vanish in
Central Australia.
At 1,528 feet, having descended about 300 feet
below the top of the range, is Torrens Creek, a busy
place in the shearing season, and then the small town of
Prairie, the rail depot for much wool and many cattle


is passed, and the Jardine Valley entered 14 miles
before arrival at Hughenden. This is the beginning of
that wonderful downs country stretching away for
250 miles almost to Cloncurry. Hughenden is built on
old “Hughenden” Station formed in 1863 by the late
Ernest Henry and Mr. Devlin, who followed Lauds-
borough’s exploring party with a herd of cattle.
Surveyed in 1877 by Mr. Bishop, it is now an up-to-
date and thriving centre with banks, hospital, shops,
Convent and State Schools, two local papers, and all the
signs of prosperity. Its water supply, excellent in
quality, is received from a sub-artesian bore that appar-
ently has an inexhaustible source. Wide streets bor-
dered with shade trees are amongst its most distinctive
features.
The Town Council was established in 1887, in which
year the railway line was officially opened, though it
was used for passenger traffic in 1885.
The year 1891 saw the big shearers’ strike spread
through the district, the strikers having had their camp
beside the river close to the town, and caused much
trouble before the military were called out. Citrus
orchards thrive here, the soil being excellent and capable
of growing a great variety of plants. The blue and Mit-
chell grass downs on which the town is built stretch away
west to the Northern Territory and South Australia,
with only breaks of gidya, mulga, and bendee, and pro-
duce some of the best beef, mutton, and wool in the
world.
Very fine grapes and oranges are grown at Hughen-
den, and considerable quantities are sent away inland,
and to the coast. Its normal rainfall is 24 inches, but
in some years double that amount has fallen. The
branch railway to Winton did much to> improve the
trade of the town as all the traffic of the splendid pas-
toral country between these centres comes via Hughenden
to Townsville.
RICHMOND.
This town stands at the junction of O’Connell Creek,
the Dutton River, and the Flinders. Messrs. Bundock
and Hays, from the Richmond River, took up and
stocked “Richmond Downs,” and from this the town
received its name. The line from Hughenden to Mara-
thon was opened on December 15, 1903, from Marathon
to Richmond on June 1, 1904, and Richmond re-
mained the terminus of the Great Northern Railway
until February 29, 1908, when the line was extended to
Julia Creek. Richmond then became entirely dependent
on the very important and ever-increasing trade provided
by the station holders and grazing selectors, and is now
a depot whence great quantities of wool and cattle are
trucked.
It lias several excellent buildings, including a hospi-
tal and a School of Arts.
Four miles from the town, at Carrar, is a wool-
scouring establishment, and at Talmoi 23 miles further
along the line, there is another, both being noted for the
quality of their scouring.
The old Woolgar goldfield, proclaimed on August
24, 1882, lies 90 miles to the north, and a little beyond
is the great Etheridge goldfield, covering 10,000 square
miles, and proclaimed on December 13, 1901. The
Woolgar reefs in the first seven years of their existence
(1880-1887) gave 15,000 oz. of gold.
The route westward continues through rolling downs
stretching away to the sky line, and covered with blue
and Mitchell grasses. On the north side may be
glimpsed dark basalt tablelands far away, whilst here
and there the monotony of the downs is broken by areas
timbered lightly with gidya, boree, whitewood, bauhinia,
bloodwood, emu, and apple trees.
Maxwelton, on the Richmond-Cloncurry route, is a
cattle and sheep loading place, and at Nonda, the next
stopping place, there is a bore, from which a long
channel, bordered by tall reed beds, runs across the
downs.
At Nelia, about 20 miles past Nonda, there is a
grove of handsome native trees near the creek, the head
of which is far away to the south. Thirty miles further
on is Julia Creek, a township within the boundaries of
“Eddington” Station. Between here and the Flinders
is the famous “Dalgonally” Station, for so long occupied
by Donald Mclntyre. When the estate was sold after his
death, it brought £150,000.
Due south from Nelia and Julia Creek is Kynuna,
on Diamantina water, where an opal-mining field was
proclaimed on January 1, 1897. Opal deposits are found
over a wide area of Western Queensland.
After passing Gilliat at 414 miles, where large num-
bers of cattle and a considerable quantity of wool are
loaded, and several other small stations, where there are
cattle and trucking yards, the train arrives at
CLONCURRY,
situated on country of quite different geological forma-
tion to the rolling downs prevailing from Hughendeu
almost this far westward, for it is the centre of the most
extensive known copper-bearing field in the world, part
of which was proclaimed a goldfield on October 1, 1874,
the actual mineral area of gold, copper, silver, and lead
already known extending over 15,000 square miles.
Remarkable features of the Cloncurry area are hills
of almost pure magnetic ore, one of these, Mount Levia-
than, close to the town, being about 200 feet in height,


and three-quarters ol a mile in circumference at the base.
I he copper ores usually are found as carbonates and red
oxides, and there are vast quantities of both, but the
lode also occurs as oxy-chloride, known as actamite and
chalcocite.
The great Australian Copper Mine, the stacks of
whose smelters are seen adjacent to the town, was found
by the late Ernest Henry, the original owner of “Hugh-
enden’’ Station, as also was the famous Mount Oxide,
80 miles north-west on the Leichhardt waters, one of the
richest copper mines in the world.
In a valley encircled by low hills, and 68 miles
south-west of Cloncurry, is the small mining township
of Duchess. The copper mine here was sold by Mr.
the mine. In the vicinity there aie several other copper
mines, including the Belgium discovered by the Kluver
Brothers in January, 1916.
Cloncurry lies 481 miles west by rail from Towns-
ville, and over 200 miles due south from the Gulf of
Carpentaria, on level country of silurian formation 670
feet above the sea, and near a bank of the Cloncurry
River, which runs north into the Flinders, and was
named after Cloncurry, the birthplace, in Ireland, of
Robert O’Hara Burke. 'Being the centre of so vast a
mineral field, and the depot for such an extensive area of
pastoral country, it must always be an important town.
The population of the town and district is over
4,000. The water supply is obtained from wells 30 to
LOADING WOOL AT JULIA CREEK.
Kennedy, late of “Bushy Park’’ Station to the Hamp-
den Company for £15,000.
Forty miles due south is another important group
—the Hampden mines—the chief mine being the Hamp-
den, owned by the Hampden Cloncurry Company, which
has a fine smelting plant here, and treats ore from its
other interests. About 18 miles further south is the well-
known Mount Elliott mine, discovered in 1898 by the
late James Elliott. In 1904 this mine was floated into a
company, and up to 1910, £BO,OOO had been spent in
plant and works, with the result that the output of
copper for the first five years was valued at £2,000,000.
The little town of Selwyn, the present terminus of the
branch line from Cloncurry, is less than a mile trom
60 feet deep, from permanent reaches in the river a mile
from the town, and from rain tanks. The streets are
wide and well kept, and the climate is dry and healthy.
Mail coaches connect with Burketown, on the Gulf, and
the mining towns near the boundary of the Northern
Territory and Camooweal, whilst another service runs to
Normanton via Donaldson.
CROYDON.
The Croydon goldfield was found in 1885, but
attracted little attention before 1886, when very rich
yields were obtained from parcels of stone sent to be
crushed at the Cumberland, on the Etheridge goldfield,
100 miles distant—Bo tons of quartz giving 1,101 oz. of


gold, which resulted in the erection of machinery at
Croydon, and the early part of 1887 witnessed the arrival
of miners from all directions.
The town was practically built in the last eig'ht
months of 1887, during which wonderful yields were
obtained from stone crushed at local batteries. Much in-
convenience was suffered from the want of permanent
surface water, which was lacking within 20 miles of its
bounds. The buildings were chiefly of galvanized iron
as the outlying country was very poorly timbered, but
sawn timber was finally obtained from two small saw-
mills on tile Gilbert, 45 miles BA^ciy.
Warden Towner's report for December, 1887, gave
the population of Croydon as 2,000 miners, 1,500 timber
getters, attendants, and labourers, 1,500 storekeeper,
tradesmen, and clerks, 1,000 women and children, and
500 Chinese, Malays, Cingalese, and Africans a total of
6,500. To-day the population has dwindled to not more
than 500. In 1887 there were 31 registered companies,
and five crushing machines at work, which treated
10,950 tons of stone that yielded oz. of gold.
Freights to Normanton, a distance of 82 miles, varied in
cost from £8 to £35.
The two towns are now connected by a railway,
which was completed in 1891.
Though Croydon’s prosperity as a mining centre is
at the ebb, there are many old miners who confidently
predict a revival of the old Northern fields, and there
are good reasons for their prophecies.
NORMANTON AND BURKETOWN.
Normanton is a small town standing on a gravel
ridge only 30 feet above tidal water on the Norman
River, 23 miles direct from the coast, 55 by the river,
and 1,382 miles from Brisbane by sea. It is the start-
ing point of the railway to Croydon, and the seaport
for a large extent of mining and a vast tract of pastoral
country.
Burketown, the oldest town on the Gulf, stands on
the Albert River, 30 miles from its mouth, and 1,500
miles by water from Brisbane.
In the early days of its existence, during the sixties,
Gulf fever was prevalent at Burketown, and frequently
fatal. Patients were taken from here to Somerset at
Cape York. This fever gradually disappeaied, and
Burketown is no longer regarded as an unhealthy
locality. The Shire Council acts for a population of
about 1,200.
The Gulf country behind Normanton and Burke-
town is remarkable for the large number and variety of
springs, including both hot and cold, the former dis-
charging streams of mud and water at a temperature of
120 degrees on the surface. The hot water is clear and
good, but the cold is unfit for drinking. The sources of
both are basins of unknown depth on the tops of huge
mounds covered by very large tea-trees, among the roots
of which hot water steams in small clear pools, the
ground all round being hollow and treacherous, and the
surface held together by densely-matted vegetation.
THE HERBERT RIVER DISTRICT.
The Herbert River was named after Robeit George
Wyndham Herbert, the first Queensland Premier. The
district through which it courses is everywhere fertile,
the soil yielding heavy crops, and all tropical fruits
growing to perfection, especially the mango, pineapple,
jrapaw, banana, and granadilla; and from all parts of its
watershed the towering mountains of Hinchinbrook
Island are visible, two of the highest being Mount Bowen
(3,650 feet), and Mount Diamantina (3,160 feet).
Between Hinchinbrook Island and the mainland is
the famous Hinchinbrook Channel, from end to end of
which (25 miles) there is magnificent and ever-changing
scenery. All the small steamers trading between Towns-
ville and Cooktown make use of this passage.
The first seaport after leaving Townsville is Lucinda
Point, for some years known as Dungeness. At present
the only public buildings here are the Custom House,
the Post and Telegraph Office, and a school. A jetty
runs out for about 400 feet to a depth of 18 feet of
water at low tide, and from the outer end of this a
steam tramline, passing the town of Halifax at six miles,
terminates at Ingham.
HALIFAX
stands on the low-level country characteristic of the best
sugar districts, and lies within about 300 yards of the
Herbert. From Halifax a branch line runs to the Mac-
nade Mill and plantation founded by the firm of Neame
and Co’, in 1873.
Visible in the distance are Mount Graeme, a giant
cone towering from Sea View Range, and Mount Far-
quharson, another conspicuous elevation. In the
scrubs of the range, Carl Lumholtz got the first known
specimen of the tree-climbing kangaroo.
INGHAM
is the chief town on the Herbert, and of considerable
importance, the Hinchinbrook Shire representing a pop-
ulation of about 5,500. It stands on Palm Creek, a
tributary of the Herbert. River, and bears the name of
an early settler who erected one of the first small sugar
mills.
Three miles from the town is the Colonial Sugar
Refining Company’s Mill, the Victoria, and 10 miles
away is the Macnade Mill, owned by the same company,
who are now the sole manufacturers on the Herbert,


where Messrs. Haig and Mills erected the first sugar mill,
calling their estate “Beamerside,” after the ancient
Scottish home of the Haig family.
The projected coastal railway from Townsville to
Cairns passes through Ingham, and is open for traffic as
far as Lilypond towards Cardwell.
Among the first selectors of the Herbert was Mr.
H. J. Atkinson, a well-known pastoralist of the district
to-day. lie had two selections on the present Victoria
plantation. In later years a number of selections were
taken up over the range, but were nearly all abandoned
Island, where he built a home, and started farming
operations amidst idyllic surroundings. He is well
known as an author and lover of Nature by his books
on the birds and insects of the Island. A little further
north is Cardwell, one of the oldest ports, and the out-
post of civilization from where Kennedy started his
disastrous journey in 1848.
The district around Cardwell is noted for its
bananas, the fruit being very fine, and large quantities
are shipped, whilst all tropical fruits grow to perfection,
and provide the means of livelihood for many.
HINCHINBROOK CHANNEL.
owing to the distance from a port and the bad state of
the roads, despite the fact that £B,OOO had been spent
on the road over the range by the Government. These
selections were in the neighbourhood of Mount Pox, a
bare, crested mountain showing an extinct crater in the
centre of the summit.
In 1921 the two local mills crushed 209,880 tons
of cane, producing 17,500 tons of raw sugar.
DUNK ISLAND AND CARDWELL.
Mr. E. J. Banfield, known to Queenslanders as
“Beachcomber,” some years ago took up portion of the
THE JOHNSTONE RIVER DISTRICT.
The Johnstone, which runs into the sea six miles
north of Mourilyan, was named after Sub-Inspector
Johnstone, of the Native Police, who went along the
coast to search for men who got ashore from the wreck
of the brig “Maria/’ lost in 1872, on her way from
Sydney to New Guinea with a party of prospectors.
The first mention of its watershed was made by
Dalrymple after his exploration in 1873, having been
accompanied by Mr. Walter Hill, the Botanist and
Curator of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, who voiced the
opinion that of 500,000 acres available for settlement,


300,000 were suitable for sugar-growing, and that it
was one of the most important discoveries in Australia.
Fine timber has been taken from this district, the
first cedar-getters being the Mazlin brothers, who oper-
ated here in 1878.
The first to definitely attempt the settlement of the
Johnstone was the late T. H. Fitz-Gerald, who landed
with a party, and cut through impenetrable scrub a pas-
sage for building materials, boats, and stores which lie
had brought in the Queensland Steamship Company’s
steamer, “Corea,” in 1880. Thus was founded the town
of
INNISFAIL,
originally called Geraldton, after Mr. I 1 itz-Gerald, the
name having been changed late in the first decade of the
present century, owing to there being a Geraldton in
Western Australia, to Tnnisfail, from the plantation
formed and owned by the founder of the town.
The centre of a most important sugar and fruit-
growing district it is highly prosperous, and, being on
the route mapped out for the Great North Coast Rail-
way, its importance premises to be considerably aug-
mented for the town will be in direct communication
with Cairns to the north, and Townsville to the south.
Its harbour, Mourilyan, some miles away, is one of
the most beautiful in Queensland, and lies in a circle of
low hills, and receives the waters of the Moresby River.
The rainfall is abnormally high, averaging 144
inches, and at times rising over 200, the highest in Aus-
tralia. In the first three months of 1888 the rainfall was
144 inches. This notable weather characteristic of the
Innisfail district is attributable to the presence- of the
lofty Bellenden-Ker Range, and Mount Bartle Frere,
rising to 5,287 feet, overlooking the Johnstone and Rus-
sell Rivers.
There are three large sugar mills on the Johnstone
—the Goondi, owned by the Colonial Sugar Refining
Company; the State Central, on the South Johnstone;
and the Australia Sugar Company’s Mill at Mourilyan.
Innisfail experienced a severe reverse in 1918, when
a large part of the town was wrecked as the result of a
cyclone.
Cowley and Fisher’s Falls, and many well-known
beauty spots, are quite close to the town, which with the
district has a population of 6,000.
CAIRNS AND DISTRICT.
Cairns is situated at the head of Trinity Bay, named
by Captain Cook on Trinity Sunday, 1770, and is 908
miles north-west from Brisbane.
This important far-northern town presents a charm-
ing picture to the tourist as the ship steams slowly up
the channel to the splendid length of concrete wharves
which stand as a memorial to the enterprise of the men
who form the personnel of the Cairns Harbour Board.
The mountain scenery visible from Cairns extends
over 60 miles in a straight line from where the crest of
Bartle Frere shows over the gap between Mount Harold
and Bellenden-Ker, to where the range dips into the sea
opposite Double Island.
In the early part of 1876 the site of Cairns was
unknown except to beche-de-mer fishermen, who came
from their station on Green Island to cut firewood. In
that year parties started from the Hodgkinson to find a
seaport, and one result was the discovery of a track to
Trinity Bay, which William Smith saw from the- north
spur of the range overlooking Kamerunga. The report
of the discovery was followed by the despatch of the
steamer, ‘ ‘Victoria, ” which towards the end of 1876 dis-
charged passengers and cargo among the mangroves of
the future town, in due course surveyed by Mr. Fred-
erick Warner, who named the main street after Mr. H.
P. Abbott, manager of the Australian Joint Stock Bank,
and Lake Street after Captain Lake of the “Victoria.”
A track was formed between the Hodgkinson and
Cairns through the site of Kamerunga across Stony
Creek, and up the range between the Red Bluff and the
cliff-faced rock along Douglas track. A second route
was known as Bill Smith’s track, and came down the
spur now cut through by No. 9 tunnel. Both tracks
were used, and both were extremely difficult. Three miles
beyond the Barron, another track descended the range,
the only road on which drays were used, the first of
which was brought down by Messrs. Jack Mulaney and
Tom Jones. Ten thousand pounds was spent on this
track, which is yet known as Thornborough Road. Four
miles beyond was Collinson’s track, where the first
packers came down from Thornborough.
For only a brief period did the trade of the goldfield
enter Cairns. The- packers disliked the three miles of soft
sea sand and mangrove mud between the Whitfield
Range and Trinity Bay, and the lack of suitable grazing
places for their horses in the township. The result was
the formation of a small settlement on the Barron—
Kamerunga—shortly followed by another on the other
side of the liver a mile lower down, started by William
Smith, and soon afterwards surveyed as a township,
and called Smithfield. The whole trade of Cairns went
to Smithfield, where hotels and stores were quickly
erected, and whence small steamers plied to and from
Cairns. Then came the discovery of Port Douglas, 30
miles to the north. A rapid exodus to that port followed
by a flood which submerged Smithfield in January,
18(3, and a northerly gale that completed the general
ruin, caused the abandonment of Smithfield, many of
whose buildings were removed. The whole trade went to


Port Douglas, and with the annihilation of Smithfield,
Cairns collapsed. All Abbott Street could have been
purchased for £SOO.
In the year 1880 the Cairns Shire Council Divisional
Board, which embraced the whole of the town of Cairns,
and a good deal of what is now the Woothakata Shire,
was formed. Mr. T. R. S. Hook was the first Clerk of
the Cairns Shire, and the late T. M. Latreille was the
first Chairman. Mr. .1. J. O’Leary took over the clerical
work at about this time, and has been an enthusiastic
worker for the Shire ever since.
The development of the district is shown in the fact
that the total rates collected in 1880 amounted to only
municipality, the Order-in-Council declaring it a
Borough bearing the dale, May 28, 1885. The first Town
Council met in an unimposing little building, and the
following gentlemen were then appointed aldermen:
Messrs. R. A. Kingsford (Mayor), John Ryan, W. D.
Hobson, L. Severin, A. Street, F. T. Wimble, S. Rodda,
A. Taylor, and G. McKay, Mr. J. A. Bunting being
appointed the first Town Clerk. The aldermanic list has
since seen many changes, the personnel of the Town
Council at the present time, as that of the Cairns Shire
Council, and the Cairns Harbour Board, comprising
men who are strongly imbued with the desire of seeing
the wealthy strip of far Northern Australia which they
STEWARTS CREEK WATERFALL NEAR INNISFAIL.
<£ll3, while £lO,OOO represented the rates collected for
the Shire Council alone in 1921.
The tinfields of Herberton were discovered in 1879,
and Cairns was eventually found to be only 52 miles
away by a fair road up the Tinaroo Spur in the Mulgrave
Valley. Then came an agitation for a railway from the
coast to Herberton, as the starting point of which two
other towns competed—Port Douglas in the north, and
Mourilyan Harbour in the south, the issue being finally
decided in August, 1884, in favour of Cairns. Three
years later, on October 8, 1887, the first section of eight
miles was opened to Redlynch.
On July 22, 1885, Cairns was declared a
represent, receive the recognition which it deserves.
The Cairns Harbour Board is one of the most pro-
gressive bodies in Queensland. Since its inception in
1906, when its representatives were Messrs. E. C. Earl
(Chairman), J. Newell, G. E. Martin, J. H. Brownlee,
H. Wade, M. Walsh, G. R. Mayers, M. Boland and
C. Walsh, it has achieved for Cairns a notable place
among the shipping towns of the State. Though, unlike
other shipping centres, it received comparatively small
assistance from the Government of the day (merely a
bucket dredger valued at £12,000) development of the
harbour was proceeded with on a scale which the follow-
ing figures will serve to illustrate.


In 1906 the revenue from harbour dues amounted
to £6,481 9s. fid. This sum was quadrupled in 1921,
when the revenue received from the same source was
.£25,822 Os. 3d.; the total revenue £31,110 11s. 6d., and
the total income £37,922 7s. In 1906 the wharfage
accommodation at Cairns consisted of four jetty wharves
lighted with kerosene. Fifteen years later four sections
of wharfage 1,200 feet in length, composed of reinforced
concrete, and carrying substantial cargo sheds, a fine
water supply, and electric light installation represented
portion of the development completed by the Board,
which had expended on the wharves alone £Bl,BlO, and
on cold storage wharves at their rear, £9,000. Vast
developmental work is now in hand, which appears well
warranted by increased trade. Statistics for the year
1921 show that the exports of Cairns represented a ton-
nage of 92,781.
The area of Cairns is square miles, and the popu-
lation of the municipality 7,450. There is a total length
of 47 miles of well-made streets of which 6 miles are
macadamized, 16 of gravel formation, and work on the
other portion is proceeding. There are 13 miles of com-
pleted curbing and channelling in concrete. The capital
value of freehold town property in 1921 amounted to
£340,825, during which year the Council revenue
amounted to £lB,OOO. Electric lighting is being in-
stalled and will very shortly replace the present gas
system.
The source of the water supply is Freshwater Creek,
where there is a reservoir with a capacity of 750,000
gallons, the water being conveyed to the town by a
simple system of gravitation.
When the Great North Coast Railway is completed,
Cairns will be in direct communication with Brisbane, a
distance of 1,040 miles.
Its climate may be gauged by the fact that the ther-
mometer in winter never falls below 50 degrees, and in
summer the average shade temperature is 90, the maxi-
mum being 100, and the minimum 84 degrees. Cairns
is regarded as possessing a most healthy climate, which
has an extremely beneficial effect on asthmatic throat
and lung complaints.
Besides being such an important sugar-growing
centre, tropical fruits, cotton, coffee, rice, and even
rubber grow wonderfully in the district, whilst it is the
natural depot for 300,000 acres of rich agricultural
land on the coast side of the range, and for the vast
and fertile valley of the upper Barron.
The principal exports include: —Raw sugar, tin,
blister copper, and ore, silver lead and ore, wolfram,
bismuth, molybdenite, live stock, hides, tallow, butter,
coffee, tropical fruits, and timber.
In speaking of those to whom the town and district
are so greatly indebted, it is but fitting to mention
one whose great spirit, untiring energy, exceptional
initiative, and capacity for organization, have notably
left their mark, namely, the late W. J. Munro, who was
Chairman of the Cairns Shire Council for about 17 years,
relinquishing his seat only when his health failed him,
and necessitated, for medical treatment, a journey to
the South, where he died in the year 1912.
Of a kindly nature, he was a far-seeing, shrewd
business man, wdio worked steadily for the development
and progress of this section of Northern Queensland.
School-teaching, butchering, accountancy, mining (as a
large speculator), farming, and grazing, were all callings
with which he was closely identified. As one of the
members of the original Shire Council, he first conceived
the ideai of putting into force the Act relating to the
construction of tramways under the control of Shire
Councils. Considering it essential, for the carrying of
Mulgrave sugar to the port of Cairns, that the Shire
Council should have a tramway, he was instrumental as
chairman, with the assistance of his fellow councillors,
and the faithful help of the Superintendent Engineer,
Mr. J. J. O’Leary, in putting into operation this line,
which in the course of time linked up Aloomba, Harvey
Creek, and Babinda with Cairns. This work was his
proudest achievement, and when the line was sold to the
Government the handling of the sale was a high tribute
to the business acumen and skill of Mr. Munro. The
profits made helped the Council to command a consider-
able sum of money for the construction of roads and
bridges, especially enabling them to open up the Babinda
section. He became interested in sugar-growing about
the time of the inception of the Mulgrave Mill land
purchases, and suffered his full share of trials and set-
backs before finally placing his cane operations on a
sound footing, to the benefit of Cairns, and the Mulgrave
Mill. ' During later years he was counted among the
important station owners of the West, having in con-
junction with Messrs. Roberts and John Gordon acquired
“Woodieigh,” “Gamboola,” “Highbury,” “Wrotham
Park,” and “Roolburra,” totalling 2,829 square miles of
country. He was also the proprietor of the Biboohra
Meat Works. Mr. Munro was a single man, and though
he amassed a very large fortune, it is universally con-
ceded that in doing so he assisted to a greater extent
than any individual yet associated with this valuable
portion of the Commonwealth, every public movement
that had for its object the district’s betterment. He
was more a thinker than a brilliant speaker, but con-
veyed always the impression of quiet strength and re-
sourcefulness. For his strong personality and loyal
friendship his memory will long be cherished by the
people of Northern Queensland. Mr. Mayers succeeded
him as Chairman of the Shire Council, and held the posi-
tion until 1919, when Councillor S. H. Warner stood for
election, since following successfully in the steps of his
late chief.


With the passing of Mr. Munro the North was not
left without its strong public men, for such good
advocates as Alderman A. J. Draper, Dr. J. H. Reed,
and others have long been recognized as men of strength,
ability, and perseverance.
Alderman A. J. Draper is a prominent business
man whose ability and sound judgment alone can be
said to be responsible for his success. As managing
director of the Mulgravo Sugar Mill, in which he has
been closely associated with Mr. S. IT. Warner, and
other public-spirited men, he has earned the esteem and
confidence of those interested in the industry in that
district. Dr. J. H. Reed, whose advocacy of the relative
percentage system of payment has been read with interest
throughout Australia, and whose valued publicity work
lie was elected alderman, and he was active in every
movement instituted as a means to progress and com-
munal welfare in his day.
KURANDA AND THE FALLS.
The journey from Cairns to Kuranda offers a series
of scenes so exquisitely beautiful that no pen could do
them justice. Rounding Whitfield Range, 1,200 feet in
height, and passing within 100 yards of the Barron
River (six miles from the mouth) is afforded a full view
of extensive rice and maize fields.
In descending the Freshwater Creek valley the line
takes a south-westerly course, later doubling back on a
sharp loop, and beginning the ascent of the base of
Mount Williams in a north-westerly direction. Thus is
GENERAL VIEW OF CAIRNS.
for Northern Queensland in the Southern press has
brought him into prominence on more than one occasion,
is one of the most popular identities of Cairns to-day.
It was mainly through Dr. Reed’s efforts that the public
of Cairns presented Mr. Munro with a gold-mounted
illustrated album containing water-colour sketches of
Cairns and district, these latter having been painted by
a specially engaged artist. As a further recognition of
his work, and to mark the appreciation of his fellow
councillors, a marble bust of the late gentleman now
ornaments the Cairns Shire Hall.
Another of the men to whom Cairns and Northern
Queensland owe much is the late Richard James Gor-
ton, who settled in the town in 1883, and became promi-
nent in various fields of activity. On several occasions
the ascent of the Main Coast Range begun, the line ris-
ing by various gradients, the steepest 1 in 50, until it
finally reaches the tableland at the Barron Falls, 1,200
feet above the sea. Mount Williams, covered by dense
jungle full of wild bananas, towers above to a height of
3,600 feet. From No. 9 tunnel the line runs due west
through three more tunnels, and along steep slopes under
overhanging rocks and jungles to the Stony Creek Falls,
and over an iron bridge 300 feet long (designed by
Engineer J. G. Gwynneth), on a 4-chain curve, and 1
in 99 grade, that crosses the ever-clear waters of Stony
Creek 70 feet beneath.
Beneath the Stony Creek bridge, on the upper side,
is a deep rock pool at the foot of a precipice 250 feet
high down which descends in a perpendicular fall the


whole stream of waters whose spray is dashed over the
bridge. The current flowing beneath still descends, form-
ing a fall 100 feet deep, and passes down a sloping ravine
over masses of dark rock and loose boulders until lost
far below in its journey to the Barron, a mile lower.
Above the line at this point tower the vast rocks and the
jungle-covered mountains of the Main Range.
Turning the curve at the bridge the train doubles
back towards the Barron, overlooks the Stony Creek,
and faces the mountains on the opposite side. It passes
through No. 14 tunnel under the Glacier Rock, an enor-
mous mass looming darkly overhead at a height of 1,700
feet, and rounds the Red Bluff on a ledge along a vast
wall of rock that towers 700 feet overhead, and descends
600 feet below. In rounding this rock is commanded
one of the grandest views on the line. Below is the valley
of the Barron, and the river winding through it, and
entering the sea at the mouth of Trinity Bay; beyond
rise the great Cape Grafton Ranges and mountains away
to the south; Cairns and the Pacific are clearly seen.
The nearer view includes Kamerunga, situated on the
river besides the Tropical Nursery, whilst away across
the flat country, down to and near the sea, are fields of
maize, rice, and bananas encircled by belts of standing
scrub.
From the point next the Red Bluff the railway runs
up the Barron Gorge, overhung with tropical jungle,
the Barron itself running 1,000 feet below over bare
rocks among gigantic boulders, while above the train are
slopes 800 feet high. On the opposite side is a range
2,000 feet high descending sheer into the Barron like a
vast plain uplifted and stood on edge, a gigantic picture
on the easel of Nature, displaying from summit to base,
a world of tropical trees and plants.
Surprise Creek is crossed by a bridge 228 feet long
standing 700 feet clear above its bed. From this bridge,
too, is seen the bed of the Barron at the bottom of 1,000
feet of sheer space.
At 19J miles from Cairns there stands on the right
hand of the line, on the edge of the abyss, Robb’s
Monument, a solitary pinnacle rock about 70 feet high.
The panorama of beauty continues to enfold for the
next three-quarters of a mile, until at last the wonderful
falls, where the river rises from 800 feet below the line
to within 50 feet of the rails, are revealed.
A quarter of a mile more and the river is seen plung-
ing into a gulf 600 feet in depth—a gulf surrounded by
giant cliffs of solid rock running up into jungle-clad
ranges. Here, in flood times, when the river brings
down the accumulated water of heavy tropical rains fall-
ing over an immense watershed, the Barron clears the
whole descent in one bound to the rocks 600 feet beneath.
Ordinarily it descends the face of the rock in a series of
falls and cascades divided in places by the undulations
of the surface.
The little township of Kuranda, which 20 years ago
was merely a camping place for the blacks, is a favourite
resort of tourists. There are two fine hotels, and several
Cairns citizens have built houses here as lesidences for
the summer months.
From Kuranda to the Falls, and from the edge of
the river eastward to the top of the Range, the jungle
remains as it doubtless appeared thousands of years
ago, and contains a world of wonders for the nature
lover. The country of which it is a centre is one of un-
bounded resources, the valley of the Upper Barron con-
taining incalculable supplies of valuable scrub timbers
far exceeding in variety timbers found in other parts of
the Continent.
MOUNT MULLIGAN
is situated 30 miles from Dimbulah, and 103 miles from
Cairns, and was named after the well-known explorer
and prospector, J. V. Mulligan, who discovered the
Hodgkinson and other rivers, and found payable gold
on the Palmer in 1873.
The mountain, which stands on the old Hodgkinson
goldfield, is a vast mass of limestone whose base, from
which massive cliffs rise abruptly and perpendicularly
for 900 feet, is 1,500 feet above sea level.
The town so named is chiefly noted as a coal-bearing
centre, for coal seams from 4 feet 6 inches to 12 feet have
been uncovered in the locality, a circumstance that will
prove very important to the country west of Cairns, as a
local coal supply will remove the more costly necessity
of purchasing from the South.
The district carries a plentiful supply of the neces-
sary hardwood timbers, especially of ironbark and iron-
wood, which are both indestructible, the latter especi-
ally seeming impervious to decay.
CHILLAGOE.
This small mining township, created by the Chilla-
goe Copper Mines, is situated on a creek which runs into
Mitchell waters and the Gulf.
The country on which it stands was taken up as por-
tion of a cattle station in 1887 by John Atherton, after
whom the town of Atherton is named, and from this
gentleman it shortly passed to his son, the present holder
of the run, who, before the town was established, bes-
towed upon his property the name of Chillagoe.
Copper was first discovered in the district at the site
of the present Zillmanton (named from Mr. Zillman, a
mining warden at Herberton) by Mr. S. J. Delaney
about 1884. At the end of 188/ Messrs. Delaney and
Linedale seriously prospected the district, and finally,
with the assistance of Mr. G. H. Atherton, located the
original find. Subsequently the interest of Mr. John
Moffat was secured, with the result that the last-named
gentleman took up large areas in various places, includ-
ing Mungana, Calcifer, and Zillmanton.


For 10 years John Moffat and his partners continued
to prospect and develop and increase their areas, and at
Christmas, 1897, had 70 men at work, and at Mungana
and Calcifer had water-jacket blast furnaces established.
The long carriage to Mareeba, and the cost of material,
including feed for horses and bullocks in droughts, re-
sulted, however, in arrears of about £40,000, and in
1898, to obviate the great existing drawbacks, the Chilla-
goe Railway and Mining Co. was floated, and operations
started on a scale not hitherto attempted in Queensland.
A syndicate re-
presented by John
Moffat,C. W. Chap-
man, and James
Smith Reid, had un-
dertaken, if granted
certain concessions
by the Government,
to construct a rail-
way from Mareeba
on the Cairns line to
Chillagoe, and the
result was the pass-
ing of the Mareeba
to Chillagoe Rail-
way Act of 1897,
giving the syndicate
the right to con-
struct a railway of
100 miles with
branch lines of
standard gauge not
exceeding 10 miles
in length. The Act
provided that the
syndicate should
have their mineral
leases of 2,000 acres
at the annual rental
of £1 per acre, free
of labour condi-
tions, for 50 years,
and that the Gov-
ernment had the
right to purchase the railway at the end of that period.
The line was completed in 1900.
Chillagoe lies inside the most extensive and varied
mineral area in Australia—an area which stretches north
and south from the heads of the Herbert to the head of
the Palmer, and east and west from beyond the Walsh
River to the sea coast, and includes the great goldfields
of the Hodgkinson and the Palmer.
Near the town are the famous Chillagoe caves dis-
covered in 18S8 by Mr. J. Armstrong, a brother-in-law
of Mr. W. Atherton of “Chillagoe” Station. They are
approached through the most remarkable scenery; and
in an angle of a converging line of great rocks is the
spacious entrance to the main cave. Beyond the entrance
one is reminded of a hall of the genii stripped of its
furniture. Overhead is a perfect glittering dome nearly
100 feet in height, and lighted on one side by a great
natural window which permits the illumination of the
whole magnificent chamber—about 80 feet in diameter —
paved throughout with coralline rock. All around the
sides are small al-
coves and embra-
sures tenanted by
grotesque but beau-
tiful figures in
white marble lime-
stone. Here a tre-
mendous crocodile,
there the replica of
a headless human
form lying as
though with limbs
relaxed in death—
yet again a huge
figure of a sheep,
and further on the
shape of an im-
mense piano with a
row of snow-white
Ijeys. The walls ap-
pear draped with
splendid curtains,
and everywhere the
imagination pic-
tures fantastic
forms of a beauty
defying description.
This series of
caves probably con-
nects with another
series a mile distant
along the same line
of hills. These are
approached in a
charming little valley about a hundred yards in width—
merely a great alcove in picturesque surrounding spires,
and turrets of very dark blue limestone.
THE ATHERTON TABLELAND
embraces an area of 400,000 acres of very rich volcanic
soil lying between the Main Coast Range and the Her-
berton Range in the Hinterland of Cairns. It is almost
entirely surrounded by mountains, the only considerable
entrance to the district being at the north-west corner,
and through this opening the Barron River flows after
STONY CREEK FALLS AND ERIDGE, CAIRNS RAILWAY.


traversing the district to reach the sea a few miles to the
north of Cairns. The Johnstone River drains the eastern
portion of the Tableland.
The average depth of the uniformly rich soil of the
area, practically the whole of which was originally dense,
tropical scrub with a few isolated pockets of forest land,
is 70 feet. Tributary creeks of the Barron and John-
stone intersect the whole country, so that most of the
surveyed farms have adequate supplies of surface water
for general stock and farming purposes.
Railway communication is provided by the main
Northern line, which skirts the western side of the
Tableland and the Tolga-Millaa Millaa line, which runs
across the country diagonally. Other transport has been
provided by private enterprise in the establishment of
several motor car services between the outlying parts of
the district and Atherton.
The average rainfall of the Tableland is 60 inches
per annum, and is fairly evenly distributed through the
year, though the main wet season occurs from January
to April, serious droughts being quite unknown here.
Although maize has been grown around the Ather-
ton-Tolga-Kairi area for upwards of 20 years, the real
development of the Tableland is being achieved through
dairying, for which the country is ideally suited, though
it has only during the last 12 years been seriously
devoted to this purpose. Dairy farmers from the Rich-
mond River, New South Wales, and other well-known
dairying centres of the Commonwealth, were attracted
by the wonderful opportunities of the district, and such
settlers developed its possibilities very rapidly so that
within the period named was established a large co-
operative butter company which has now an annual
turnover reaching £200,000, whilst a co-operative bacon
company will be operating in the near future. It is
unanimously agreed by leading stock judges and other
experts that the stock produced here is of excellent
quality.
The main reason of the success of dairying on the
Tableland is found in the climatic conditions which its
situation at an elevation of 2,000 feet above sea level,
and within 25 miles of the sea, commands. Severe
weather conditions as experienced by other dairying dis-
tricts of Queensland are practically unknown. The
finely-bred Jersey revels in the beautiful sunshine and
rich pastures, and the Tllawarras and Friesians main-
tain their stamina and constitution without any kind of
artificial feed, the use of which the prodigality of the
soil renders unnecessary.
There are several butter factories and a few private
cheese factories in the district, which carries, approxi-
mately, 12,000 dairy cows, while the area of grass is
32,000 acres. A considerable number of bullocks used
for hauling timber are kept in the timber areas, and are
grass fed. The average production of milk for the past
season was 381 gallons per cow, the best average so far
attained.
With the large area of scrub land available, and the
ideal conditions prevailing, the Atherton Tableland needs
only to become more widely known to attract a large
number of the best type of settler.
The official figures show that the Tableland pro-
duced in 1921:—Butter, over 1,000,000 lb.; maize,
445,175 bushels; coffee, 6,700 lb.; peanuts, 322,920 lb.;
oranges, 3,227 bushels; pineapples, 140 dozen; bananas,
3,402 bunches; mangoes, 5,165 bushels; papaws, 2,625
dozen; lemons, 2,103 bushels; apples, 1,550 bushels;
peaches, 317 bushels; and millions of feet of various
timbers were cut.
ATHERTON,
situated in a beautiful valley on the edge of the basalt,
68 miles from Cairns and 2,466 feet above sea level, is
the chief centre of the great dairying, agricultural, and
timber-bearing district. It bears the name of John
Atherton, an early squatter, who took up “Emerald
End,” “Chillagoe,” and other stations; and in the first
years of settlement in the North its site was known as
Prior’s Pocket—Prior being the name of a cedar-getter
who operated in the' locality.
The first selection in the district was taken up in the
year 1882 by Mr. B. Kelly, who grew maize for the pack-
horses used by carriers between Herberton, Cairns, and
Port Douglas.
In the years 1881 and 1882, the first pit sawyers,
of whom there were 12 pairs, operated in the district,
these cutting nothing but cedar, then the most abundant
and easily sawn of the many existing varieties of timber.
Then followed the great cedar-cutting era, when Messrs.
Mazlin, Forsyth, Hill, Petersen, Thomas and Garland,
and Ziggenbein started to cut for Messrs. Blair, of Mel-
bourne, and Burns, Philp & Co. All these combined
actually cut about 25,000,000 feet of cedar. They
chiefly employed kanakas, who were paid from £2 to
£2 10s. per month and rations, and were not only first-
class axemen, but a great protection against the abori-
gines, who were consistently hostile. This vast quantity
of cedar was cut within a 5-mile radius of Atherton, and
some idea of the type of timber produced in the Atherton
district will be gauged when it is mentioned that a red
cedar growing on the site of Mr. Mazlin’s present home
contained 25,000 feet in the trunk alone.
Atherton is certainly one of the most prosperous
towns in the State, with a population including the dis-
trict of 3,700.
YUNGABURRA
was originally called Alumba, its name having been
changed because of the resemblance to Aloomba, a town-
ship on the Mulgrave.


BARRON GORGE.


In 1889, when the Hon. Hume Black was Minister
for Lands, the area comprising the locality was surveyed
in small farms of 40 acres, and each occupier had the
right to a township allotment on which to reside. This
scheme, however, proved unsuccessful. Later, the Land
Act providing for homesteads of 160 acres at 2s. 6d. per
acre and five years’ residence came into force with much
more satisfactory results. The first selection was taken
up by Mr. G. H. O’Donnell, who was followed by Messrs.
J. R. Roseblade, J. Stewart, Alick Woods, and H. S.
Williams.
In the craters of extinct volcanoes are two remark-
able freshwater lakes—Lake Eacham, with an area of
140 acres and a depth of 240 feet, and Lake Barrine,
with an extent of 250 acres and reported to be bottom-
less.
Since the advent of the railway the township has
progressed considerably, and is now a thriving centre.
HERBERTON
was given its name by Messrs. William Jack and John
Newell through being on the Herbert River waters.
The town owes its existence to the discovery or a
tin reef in the locality on April 19, 1880, by Messrs.
William Jack, John Newell, Thomas Brandon, and John
Brown, who named their find the Great Northern Tin
Mine, posted notices on the following day, and took pos-
session on May 6, the first mining work at Herberton
being actually inaugurated two days later.
On July 17, the first tin was taken from Herberton
by pack-horse, the route followed being the Thorn-
borough Road.
On August 21, Warden Mowbray laid out the town,
which then consisted o-f one hotel, a butcher’s shop, and
three stores. The first mining licenses were issued on
October 30, 1880, and the first mail service—from Her-
berton to Cairns—was inaugurated on November 20 of
the same year.
In four years the tin yield amounted to 7,000 tons
valued at £385,000, of which £63,000 was paid for car-
riage to a seaport.
After Herberton came the discovery of Watsonville,
about six miles away, by Mr. R. Watson. Here one
claim alone, owned by Messrs. O’Loan and Casey, gave
tin to the value of £50.000. Coolgarra, 25 miles away,
Irvinebank, Newellton—discovered by J. V. Mulligan
and party —and other centres, were all created with the
further discovery of tinfields.
Mr. W. M. Mowbray was the first Police Magistrate
of Herberton.
The press became established with the appearance
in 1881 of the Wild River Independent owned by Mr.
Morgan Green, and of the Herberton Advertiser, in
September of the same year. Mr. A. J. Boyett came
later with the Wild River Times.
The district of which Her her ton is the centre has a
population of 3,000; the climate is excellent, the shade
temperature in summer varying from 80 to 85 degrees,
falling at night to 65, the tableland being over 3,000
feet above sea level.
This town is built entirely of red cedar, houses,
shops, public buildings, all being constructed of this
beautiful timber which at present appears drawing near
the point of extinction.
Maize does well in the district, and the crop in 1921
yielded 446,979 bushels. Fruit, flowers, and vegetables
grow to perfection in this centre, which, situated on
stony ridges, is perfectly drained, and safe from flood.
South from Cairns is the prosperous
MULGRAVE AND RUSSELL RIVERS
DISTRICT,
including Gordonvale, Pyramid, Aloomba, Behana,
Babinda, Daradgee, and the Hambledon Sugar Planta-
tion, now the property of the C.S.R. Company, but
originally taken up in 1882 by Messrs. Swallow and
Derham, of Melbourne, who cleared the estate, planted
it with cane, and erected the mill.
At the Mulgrave River stands the Mulgrave Central
Sugar Mill at the township of Gordonvale, and facing
it on the south side of the river is the great Walsh
Pyramid, named by Dalrymple in 1873 after the Hon.
William Henry Walsh, one-time Speaker and Minister
for Works.
It is a giant cone of solid granite rising to 3,050
feet, very lightly timbered, and on one side showing a
sheer tremendous precipice of 2,500 feet.
On this line is the impressive and magnificent Bel-
lenden-Ker Range, the highest in the State and amongst
the loftiest in Australia, towering to a height of over
5,000 feet. It was first seen when the “Endeavour”
sailed up the coast in June, 1770, but was not named
until June, 1819, by Captain P. P. King after two well-
known Scottish families, Bellenden-Ker.
The first selections of the Mulgrave were taken up
in 1881 and 1882, those on the north side by the Mc-
Pherson brothers and a Mr. Donald McAulay, and
Messrs. Adams and Latreille on the south side. One of
the first settlers on the Russell v.as a Frenchman named
De Touris.
At Babinda Creek is the great Central Sugar Mill,
one of the most complete mills in Queensland. It stands
under the evening shadows of the Bellenden-Ker Range.
The Russell and the Mulgrave were named by
Dalrymple on November 18, 1873, though the discovery
of these rivers dates from 1848, when the boats of the
“Rattlesnake” entered them.
PORT DOUGLAS
was reported as a new port in 1878 by Mr. C. Palmer-
ston, and in that year, when the town of Smithfield was


demolished by flood, its inhabitants for the greater por-
tion flocked to Port Douglas, which offered the attraction
of safe building ground, and a seafront nearer than
Cairns to the Hodgkinson and Thornborough goldfields.
An open roadstead without shelter on the north and
east, it was originally called White Cliffs, and, later,
Island Point, Port Owens, Port Terrigal, and finally
Port Douglas, in honour of the Hon. John Douglas, who,
at the time, was Premier of Queensland.
When roads were made down the range to connect
the township with Thornborough, all the trade of the
goldfields came to it, and as evidence of its prosperity
no less than 30 public houses were opened. In those
days money was plentiful and spent with lavish hands
until the prospects of the embryo town were darkened
by the inauguration of the Cairns Railway, as the start-
ing point of which Port Douglas strongly asserted its
rights, though vainly, for Cairns' great asset, a superior
harbour, decided the question.
aci’es under cultivation. In 1921 the Mossman Mill
crushed 62,166 tons of sugar-cane, producing something
like 3,885 tons of raw sugar.
Here in the seventies, large quantities of very fine
red cedar were cut, being floated down the river to the
beach, made into- rafts and towed out to vessels waiting
in deep water.
Further north is Daintree, where, from 1879 to
1885, many selections were taken up by Southern men
for speculative purposes. The scrub still stands on them,
and the Daintree watershed has so far remained practi-
cally undeveloped, as only a few selectors have settled
there, the first being Messrs. John and Gavin Stewart,
who were also among the original settlers of the Bunda-
berg district. Towering over the Daintree at 4,000 feet are
the Heights of Alexandria, a vast double-topped granite
mountain with a central ravine 1,000 feet in depth,
along which travels a strong current that finally at the
south end drops in a magnificent waterfall of 1,500 feet.
VIEW OF MOSSMAN.
Port Douglas is healthily and picturesquely situated,
and has a background of jungle-clad mountains stretch-
ing away south towards Cairns and north to the tower-
ing summits of the Heights of Alexandria, named by
Daintree in 1874. A splendid beach curves for four miles
towards the Mossman and thence on to the Daintree at
26 miles, and another extends south to the Mowbray, a
small river seven miles away.
The population of town and district is 1,350.
MOSSMAN.
twelve miles from Port Douglas by tramway, was named
from Mr. Hugh Mossman, one of the Charters Towers
prospectors, and a brother-in-law of Sir Thomas Mc-
Tlwraith. The first two settlers on the Mossman were
Messrs. Dan. Hart and J. P. Johns in about 1878.
The first cane for the Mossman Mill was grown in
1896, whilst to-day there are between 6,000 and 7,000
w
COOKTOWN.
Magnificently picturesque coastal scenery extends
from Cairns north to Cape York, and thence to the
island-studded expanse of Torres Strait.
Cooktown, historically, is the most interesting town
on the coast of Australia, for on the shore of this
delightfully situated little harbour Captain James Cook
beached his damaged vessel, and with his party remained
on the site of the town from June 13, to August 4, 1770,
naming the Endeavour River. Here, Joseph Banks, the
famous botanist, made tea from one of the Melaleuca
trees, ever since known to Australians as the “tea” tree;
for he knew that it belonged to an Indian species out
of which cajeput oil of commerce is made.
From Mount Cook, a landmark of the town rising
to 1,500 feet, Banks and Solander collected many speci-
mens of unknown flora.
The next white men to ascend Mount Cook were


from Flinders’ party in October, 1802, and after a lapse
of 17 years Captain P. P. King, who named the mount
on June 27, 1819, came to the harbour in the “Mer-
maid,” bringing the celebrated botanist, Alan Cunning-
ham, who made the ascent then, and again on August 2
in the year 1820.
The first appearance of Cooktown on the pages ot
Queensland history is in a paragraph from Dalrymple’s
account of the North Coast Expedition of 1873. “At
6 a.m. on October 31, the ‘Leichhardt,’ Captain
Saunders, steamed out of the Endeavour, leaving a
lovely little seaport, gleaming with white tents and
noisily busy with workmen, where* a week before we
found a silent wilderness.”
The occupants of the suddenly established canvas
town were the diggers joining in the first rush to the
Palmer goldfield after the announcement of the discovery
of payable gold by J. V. Mulligan, a full account of
which appears on pages four and five of this volume.
The port rose rapidly to an important place among
the towns of Queensland, the “Leichhardt” and the
schooner, “Countess of Belmore,” being the pioneers of a
whole fleet of trading vessels. People of all sorts and
conditions thronged here, and in April, 1874, there were
65 publicans’ licenses issued and 30 more applied for,
20 eating houses, 12 large and 20 smaller stores, six
butchers, five bakers, three tinsmiths, chemists, fancy-
goods shops, watchmakers, bootmakers, and saddlers.
The preliminaries ,of civilization were soon settled, and
forms of a government promptly established in this sea-
port of a goldfield which once contained 15,000 Euro-
peans and 20,000 Chinese. Mr. Thomas Hamilton and
Mr. James Pryde were, respectively, the first Police
Magistrate and Clerk of Petty Sessions, the first Court
having been held on December 27, 1873. In 1874 an
enterprising journalist launched the Courier newspaper,
which was soon followed by the Herald. On April 5,
1876, the town became a municipality of 15 square miles
with 20 miles of streets.
The railway westward towards the Palmer was
passed by Parliament after long discussion and much
delay, and the first sod was turned by Mayor Darcy on
April 3, 1884, the first section of 30 miles being opened
on November 3, 1885, and to the Laura, at 67 miles, on
October 8, 1888.
Cooktown is situated at the north of the Endeavour
on solid granite forming the slope of an elevation known
as Grassy Hill whose huge boulders lie scattered along
its face down to the locality back of the houses in the
main street. It is protected on the east by this hill,
which rises sheer from the water’s edge, and on the south
by Mount Cook, from which may be viewed the town,
the harbour, and the river winding away through dark-
brown forest; magnificent mountain scenery, ranges,
table tops, cone-shaped peaks, and pyramids of bare
rock. Eastward, northward, and southward stretches
the Pacific. On the opposite side of the Bay to the north,
bordering the entrance of the harbour, is a very beauti-
ful range that terminates seaward at Cape Bedford, the
site of an aboriginal mission station. A bay beyond
Cape Bedford receives the Mclvor, a small river 40 miles
from Cooktown and running through rich basaltic open
plains with belts of scrub. All that country, behind which
lies a sandstone tableland, is rich grazing land suitable for
agricultural purposes and possessing a healthy climate
and good water supply. Farming and fruit-growing have
proved most successful here.
South of Cooktown, at a distance of 26 miles along
the coast, is the Bloomfield River, running into Weary
Bay, named by Captain Cook.
Eighteen miles from Cooktown, on the road to the
Bloomfield River, is one of the most remarkable scenes in
Australia, the central figure of which is the Black Moun-
tain. This mountain is divided and the road passes
through the gap, from which rises a vast ridge 1,800
feet in height—a colossal wedge-pointed parapet of enor-
mous rocks piled in dreadful confusion from base to

the most northerly settlement in Queensland, about
1,400 miles by sea from Brisbane, was established in 1864
as the result of a recommendation from Sir George
Bowen, the first Governor of the State, who cruised thus
far in 1862.
Its first resident Magistrate was William Jardine,
previously Police Magistrate and Land Commissioner at
Rockhampton. vVilliam Jardine’s sons, Frank and
Alick, were the explorers who in 1864 successfully
travelled cattle and horses overland from Rockhampton
to Somerset across some 800 miles of country then prac-
tically unknown north of Bowen.
Six miles north of Somerset is Cape York, the north-
ernmost point of Australia, and not far from the Cape,
two miles from the mainland,.is Possession Island, for
ever memorable in Australian history as the spot on
which Cook, on August 21, 1770, hoisted the British
flag, and took possession of all the East Coast as “New
South Wales.”

at Pennant Hills, Sydney. He
is a grandson of the late Allan Wil-
liams, who was for many years Chief
Accountant of the Survey Depart-
ment of the New South Wales Civil
Service. The second son of the last-
mentioned gentleman, Mr. Williams,
of Sydney, was born on March 8,
1840, at Inverness, Scone, New
South Wales, and educated in
Sydney at schools conducted by Mr.
Dods and Mr. Horneman. His
career has been closely interwoven
with the great industry which is
the backbone of the land’s pros-
perity; and his first step in its
direction was his acceptance, in the
year 1857, of a post as jackaroo
on “Keira” Station, near Bingera.
After three years spent in obtain-
ing a grounding in the industry
here, he set out with Mr. Adams
for Queensland, where he entered
upon a long association with “Curri-
willinghi” Station, near the border.
This was in 1860, and “Curriwil-
linghi” was destined to know him for
the following seventeen years. In
the course of that period, he ac-
quired a share in a property near
Muswellbrook, New South Wales,
and became the owner of holdings
on the Culgoa River, and of “Horse
Plains” Station in Queensland. Of
“Curriwillinghi” he has many inter-
esting reminiscences, some of these
relating to blacks and bushrangers.
He remembers an amusing incident
in connection with a bushranger
known as Thunderbolt, wlm ter-
rorized the district in the early days,
and whose intended victims on one
occasion were an Irish hawker and
his wife. At the time they were
“held up,” the latter was in charge
of the money made by the pair, so
every time the bushranger
approached her she screamed vio-
lently. Though expostulating with
her for her noise, and assuring her
that the “dacent” man would not
hurt her, the husband vigorously
encouraged her in her native tongue
“to squeal, darlint, squeal !” and
squeal she did with such effect that
Thunderbolt retired, leaving the
honours with the lady. In the year
1880, Mr. Williams became asso-
ciated with the development of the
Central district of the State, taking
charge of the well-known “Oxford
Downs” Station in the vicinity of
Nebo and then owned by Mr. H.
J. Adams. “Oxford Downs” contin-
ued to be his headquarters for eleven
years, and he relinquished its man-
agement to personally control inter-
ests which he acquired in the same
district in the nineties. He then be-
came the owner of “Burrenbring,”
on which property he took up
his residence in the year 1894,
thenceforward continuing to super-
vise its administration until 1920,
when he moved with his wife and
MR. A. C. WILLIAMS.
daughters to Sydney where he en-
tered upon well-earned retirement
from active association with the

industry which had claimed so many
years of his life. During his lengthy
sojourn in the Nebo district he
played his part with other promin-
ently public-spirited pastoralists in


furthering, by all possible means, its
progress, to which end he carried
cut for about thirty-eight years the
duties of Chairman of the Nebo
Divisional Board, which, under a
more recent system, changed its
title to the Nebo Shire Council. He
was also keenly interested in Munici-
pal work; and locally, was the most
prominent supporter of clean sport
as president, for nearly forty years,
of the Nebo Jockey Club. Mr - .
Williams, who married in 1884,
Harriet Rose, daughter of Mr.
Henry Homer, of Kingsgrove, near
Canterbury, New South Wales, had
but, after serving for a time in
Egypt, was allotted to an infantry
battalion on Gallipoli. In memory
of his heroism, the residents of Nebo
and its district presented the
bereaved father with a fine por-
trait of his late son, a fac-
simile of which now hangs in the
meeting hall of the Shire Council’s
rooms. Allan Crowther Williams,
the second son of Mr. Allan Wil-
liams, whose duty lay, and still lies,
in the work of industrial develop-
ment at home and in relieving the
pioneer of the responsibilities which
he had for so long shouldered, was
“Burrenbring,” and here continued
to assist his father until the year
1914, when his brother, the late
Edward H. Williams, joined the
A.I.F. He then entered upon the
management of “Homevale,” in
which he has since been engaged.
In the period that has elapsed since
1914, other interests have been
acquired, these including “Linton
Downs,” a holding on the Isaacs
River, and which is controlled by
Mr. Williams, Jun., from his head-
quarters at “Homevale.” A lover
of clean sport and the owner of

the late Edward Homer Williams,
the first volunteer of the Nebo dis-
trict, fell at Gallipoli on June 28,
1915, at Chatham’s Post; while
Henry Stuart Williams, 38th Bat-
talion, A.1.F., breathed his last on
April 6, 1918, on the battlefields of
France, during the engagement at
Villers Brettoneux. The former,
Edward Homer, was originally a
member of the sth Light Horse,
educated by a tutor at “Burren-
bring,” and completed his school
course in Mackay. Choosing the
life to which his father had devoted
so many years, he entered the pas-
toral industry at “Burrenbring,”
in the working of which he assisted
for two years. In 1908, with the
view of enlarging his field of ex-
perience, he accepted a position at
“Camoola Park,” and under the
guidance of the owner, Mr. Moffat,
a pioneer of the Central West,
obtained a good insight into the
wool and mutton industry. His
objective achieved he returned to

daughter of Mr. Peter Elgin John-
stone, of “Strathmore” Station,
who, though a native of New South
Wales, has spent much of his life in
Northern Queensland, and been long
a resident of the Bowen district.
Three sons, Allan Homer, Stuart
Maxwell and Henry Crowther, and
a daughter, Edna Homer, are the
issue of the union.


EDWARD HANNAN, J.P.,
proprietor of “Eaglefield” Station,

South Wales, on May 25, 1869, and

Edward Hannan of “Eaglefield” was
educated by the Christian Brothers
at their College in Maitland. When
his school days were over he
remained for a short period in
Maitland, and was not yet in his
teens when he became employed on
a pastoral property in the outlying

for several years, finally enlarging
his experience of the industry and
the geographical conditions of the
Queensland bush by taking on drov-
ing work. In the middle nineties,
deciding to try his hand at commer-
cial life, he entered into engagement
with the firm of Michelmore & Co.,

Pocket,” a sugar farm on the Pioneer
River, near Mirani, and “Mt, Mc-
Gregor,” a farm on “The Hollow”
Estate, which he acquired by pur-
chase, and where his eldest son was
born. When at “Mt. McGregor”
he acquired cattle interests, which,
proving profitable, led to his em-
barking more extensively in the
grazing industry. For the purpose
he took up “Eaglefield,” a station
formerly owned by Mr. J. B. Shan-
non and abandoned by him during
the big drought which was so
severely felt during the closing years
of the last and the opening years of
the present century. With the
advent of normal seasons “Eagle-
field” recuperated to the extent of
fully justifying Mr. Hannan’s choice,
for it is fine cattle country,
supplemented by a few good wells
which were sunk by the present own-
er’s instructions. Though devoting so
much of his attention to grazing
pursuits Mr. Plannan has continued
to be no less interested in the pro-
gress of the great industry which is
so solidly established around Mackay.
He was the pioneer of the Finch-
ilatton district, where he opened up
the first sugar lands, and he was also
very prominently concerned in the
movement which was responsible for
the opening of the railway in that
district. In the year 1910 he ac-
quired interests in the North Eton
district, purchasing “Aberdeen”
Farm, which has since been his head-
quarters. From this property, on
which he engages in sugar produc-
tion, he administers his pastoral in-
terests at “Eaglefield,” which is
under the personal management of
his eldest son, Edward Maitland
Hannan. Mr. Hannan, Sen., is one
of the most public-spirited members
districts in which lie has resided. For
nearly twenty years he served as a
councillor of both the Pioneer and
Mirani Shires, and he has been to
the fore also as a member of the
Cane Prices Boards, as a Director of
Mills and in association with other
bodies formed in the interests of
communal and industrial progress.
He was created a Justice of the
Peace under the Kidston Adminis-
tration. In the year 1896 he
married Josephine, daughter of the
late Charles O’Malley, who, hailing
from County Galway, Ireland, settled
in Queensland very many years ago
as the head master of the Catholic
School in Rockhampton, which was
the forerunner of the present Christ-
ian Brothers’ College in that city.
The late Charles O’Malley was a
well-known citizen of Rockhampton
in the early days both in connection
with his professional duties, and,
later, on their relinquishment, in
commercial life. The name which
he bore is one of the most ancient
in the history of Ireland and many
and interesting are the traditions
which surround it. Mr. Hannan
has a family of two sons and two
daughters. The eldest son, Edward
Maitland, who as already men-
tioned engaged in the management
of “Eaglefield” under his father’s
direction, was born on May 16,
1903, and educated at Nudgee
College, Brisbane, and Xavier Col-
lege, Kew, Victoria. Basil, the
second son, is also a student at
Xavier College, which he entered
from Nudgee, his birth having
occurred at Marian on March 6,

belongs, as evidenced by his active
connection with the various move-
ments set afoot for the purpose of
advancing the interests of the
1907. Of the daughters, Valda, the
elder, is at present taking a course
in science at the University of Bris-
bane, while Mora is a student at the
Melbourne Conservatorium.

Northern Queensland, was born in
Mackay, with which town and its
district the family of which he is a

member has been identified since the
sixties, thus ranking among the old-
est in the State. He is the second
son of Mr. Richard Atherton of
MR. G. A. TURNOR.
Yeerongpilly, near Brisbane. The
last-mentioned gentleman has played
a very active and prominent part
in the pastoral development of
Northern Queensland. He first made
his advent to the State during the
year following that which marked
the separation from New South
Wales of the vast territory of which
it is comprised; and he is a member
of the second generation of the
name under the Southern Cross.
The founder of the family which
Mr. A. R. Atherton represents at
“Blue Mountain” was Edmund
Atherton, a Lancashire gentleman,
who, hailing from that County,
where he had. been engaged as an
agricultural landowner, brought his
wife and seven children then born
to him to New South Wales.
Edmund Atherton settled in the
Mother Colony in the year 1844 on
a property distant 25 miles from
Armidale and called “Baldblair.
Here were born the two youngest of
his nine children, of whom six were
sons, and eight eventually settled
in Queensland. At “Baldblair the
late gentleman reared his large
family and devoted many years to
pastoral pursuits, finally disassociat-
ing himself with the district in the
development of which he had played
so large a part to found a station
in Northern Queensland, the poten-
tialities of which had been repre-
sented to him by his eldest son,
James, who, in the middle fifties,
had started out on his own account
and formed a sheep station, called
“Rosewood,” on the Fitzroy River,
at a site less than fifty miles from
Rockhampton. In the year 1860,
the pioneer and his family set out
with their united possessions disposed
of in a variety of vehicles drawn by
three bullock teams and a horse
team, the riders of the party having
in charge 2,000 shorthorn cattle.
Hie overland journey from New
South Wales to Northern Queens-
land was no small undertaking at
the period, as may be imagined when
the vastness and sparsely settled
state of the country through which
they passed is taken into consider-
ation. After being en route for four
months, they at length arrived at
their destination and occupied the
country in the Rockhampton district
now known as “Mount Hedlow.”
On this holding, which was design-
ated “Hedloo” from the aboriginal
word meaning mountain and the fact
of a large elevation forming a con-
spicuous feature of the run, the
pioneer Atherton inaugurated the
necessary developmental operations
and continued to work the property
as a cattle area until the time of his
death, which occurred in 1863,
three years after his arrival in the
present State. His family contin-
ued to reside at “Mount Jledlow

His first venture, which, for some
time after its acquirement, was
known as “Atherton Camp,” and
from a later date, as “Woonon,” the

Plane Creek. He formed the area
into a cattle station and continued
to hold it until 1901, having, in the
“Suttor Creek,” selling this property
after holding it for a time, to Mr.
Murray Clark, from whom it passed
to the present owner. “Plevna” was
purchased from him by Mr. Norman

up a large tract of virgin country

This property he devoted to the

all matters tending to the advance-
ment of the town and district, and
the name of the former lives in the
memory of the community as that of
one of Mackay’s most enterprising
pioneers. Mr. William Marsh was
born in “Crewkerne,” Somersetshire,
England, in the year 1837. In
December of the year 1862 he left
his native land for Queensland owing
to the representations of the late
Hon. H. Jordan, the Agent-General
for the then Colony, and was accom-
panied to Brisbane—his first destin-
ation—by two young friends named
Seaward and Genge, the voyage hav-
ing been accomplished in the ship
‘ Golden City.” The three had been
employed in a London firm, which,
under the title of Leaf, Sons and Co.,
carried on business in Old Change;
and were all mere lads at the time
of their arrival in 1863. After a
brief sojourn in Brisbane they pro-
ceeded to Bowen, where they had
purchased a small building from a
Mr. Warry, one of their first friends
in their adopted country and an
early merchant of the Capita], to
whom they had brought an introduc-
tory letter from England. They
made their advent to Bowen in the
year 18(53, when the settlement was
only two years old, and there found
a very large scope for their enterprise
in the big j)astoral district then being
rapidly settled, as the site of the pres-
ent Townsville was still undisturbed
by the hand of man and Bowen was
the port which supplied the holdings
as far north as settlement had
extended, as well as those within a
vast radius to the south and west.
Before long the business of Messrs.
Seaward, Marsh & Genge grew to the
extent of necessitating the opening
of branches in neighbouring localities,
one of these being formed three years
after their arrival in the North at
Ross Creek and conducted under the
title of Clifton & Aplin, Mr. Aplin
having previously been an assistant
in the Bowen house. In 1869, after
the firm was reconstructed under the
title of Marsh & Warry a branch was
opened in Mackay under the manage-
ment of Mr. Webster. The first gap
in the firm of Seaward, Marsh and
Genge occurred in the year 1865
owing to the tragic disappearance of
Mr. Genge, who, it is supposed, was
murdered, while travelling on “Bur-
dekin Downs” Station, by the blacks,
who were a constant menace to the
settlers at the time. A few years
later Mr. Seaward went to Sydney
to join the firm of Farmer & Co., and
Mr. Marsh admitted into partnership
Mr. Warry, the gentleman from
whom the building in which he and
his friends started operations, was
purchased. In 1873, Mr. Marsh
sold his interests in the business to
Mr. Warry and went to England,
where he remained for about two
years. On his return in 1875, he
settled in Mackay, where he estab-
lished a partnership with Mr. Web-
ster in the business which that
gentleman had, in 1872, purchased
from the firm of Marsh & Warry.
Thenceforward, for thirty-four
years, he continued to be the leading
figure of what for nearly half a cen-
tury has continued to rank as one of
the oldest and most respected of the
mercantile houses of Mackay. After
the death of Mr. Webster, which
occurred in the year 1895, a limited
liability company was formed with
Mr. Marsh as General Manager and
Chairman of Directors —a capacity
in which he still acted at the time
of his seventieth birthday. Mr.
Marsh passed away in the year 1909,
having always shown himself, during
his long and prominent connection
with tli© history of Mackay, a man
well worthy the love and respect of
his fellows, not only by his keen sense
of honour and his unfailing integrity,
but by the many good works which he
was foremost in promoting for the
happiness or well-being of the com-
munity. A memorial was erected to
his memory in Holy Trinity Church,
of which he was for many years
churchwarden, by his son and
daughters, lie occupied the Mackay
Mayoral Chair during the year 1878
and was a member of the Mackay
Harbour Board and Council for some
years, and in other ways gave ample
evidence of his public spiritedness.
He married, in the year 1866, Eliza-
beth, daughter of William and Mary
Seaward, of Devonshire, and had a
family of two sons and four
daughters. In 1881, two years after
the death of this lady, which occurred
in 1879, he contracted a marriage
with her sister, Mary Seaward, of
which union there was no issue. Of
the pioneer’s children, the two eldest
died in Bowen in childhood. His

born in St. Austell, Cornwall, over
sixty years ago. He arrived in
Queensland with his parents in the
early sixties, being at the time a year
old. His father, James Brown, was
of Scottish birth and descent, having
settled in Cornwall for some time
before undertaking the voyage to
Australia, which was accomplished in
a sailing vessel. On arrival, he
immediately became associated with
the sugar industry on the Mary
River, subsequently occupying a
Government post as Inspector of
Distilleries. His last years were
spent in retirement in his home near
Brisbane. Mr. James Vivian Brown
at an early age entered the Postal
Department of the Civil Service, and
when still a comparatively young
man had risen to the position of
Postmaster at Mackay. From this
centre he was transferred in the
same capacity to Charters Towers.
After 25 years’ connection with the
Civil Service he resigned to take a
post with the firm of Marsh &
Webster, to the interests of which he
thenceforward assiduously devoted
himself, and with which he continued
to be connected until the time of his
death in the year 1919. He became
Chairman of Directors and General
Manager of the business on the death
of Mr. William Marsh. Finding
leisure for public interests Mr.
Brown was for long a member of the
Mackay Chamber of Commerce and
of the local Shire Council. He was

foremost among those who took a
prominent part in Masonic affairs,
having been a Master of the craft,
which at his death accorded him a
Masonic funeral. In the year 1891
he married Ethel Louise, daughter
of the late William Marsh, and had
a family of four sons and two
daughters. Edward Marsh Brown,
his eldest son, was born in Charters
Towers on May 5, 1895, and educated
at the Brisbane Grammar School,
thence joining the staff of the Aus-
tralian Bank of Commerce. In the
year 1915 he joined the A.I.F. and
was despatched with his unit to
France, where, participating as a
stretcher bearer in the Great War,
he became a casualty through gas.
On his subsequent recovery in Aus-
tralia he went into the business
founded by his grandfather. In the
year 1919 he married Mary, daughter
of Mr. George Beresford of Mackay.
William Marsh Brown, the second
son, was born on Mai'ch 2, 1897, and
educated at the Mackay High School
and the Brisbane Grammar School.
He was engaged in the Mackay bus-
iness until the age of twenty, when
he enlisted. He saw service with the
49th Battalion in France, taking
part in the various actions after
Braie until the termination of
the War. His third brother,
James Donald Marsh, was born in
Mackay on May 12, 1899. On con-
cluding his studies at the Mackay
High School, he entered the pastoral
industry on “Rodney Downs,” a
Western Queensland sheep station,
where he remained until of an age to
volunteer for the firing line with his
brother William, with whom he
served in France until the termina-
tion of hostilities. On his return to
Australia he again interested him-
self in pastoral pursuits, finally
becoming associated with his elder
brother as a member of the staff of
Marsh & Webster. Harold Vivian
Marsh, the youngest son of the late
J. V. Brown, was born in Mackay on
MR. J. D. M. BROWN.
September 14, 1907, and at present
is a student of the Mackay High
School. The two daughters, Mary
Alison and Dulcie Gertrude, reside
with their mother in Mackay.


ALBERT WILLIAM GOHDES,
Peel Street, Mackay, was born on
March 10, 1872. He is a native of
Mackay and a son of the late Albert
Gohdes, who, hailing from Central
Europe and accompanied by his wife
and two children, settled in Aus-
tralia over half a century ago, mak-
ing his first home at “Suitor Creek,”
near Nebo. The late gentleman was
employed for some considerable time
as a station hand at “Suttor
Creek,” which was then owned by
the late Mr. Hess; and on leaving
there he became engaged in farming
and dairying near Mackay, where
the five younger members of his
family were born. Dairying and
agrarian pursuits occupied his ener-
gies for iho remainder of his life.

his early teens, and from then on-
ward continued to gain first-hand
knowledge of every phase of the
industry, his field of experience
covering operations among both
horned and woolly stock on the
Western Queensland stations, “Rook-
wood” and “Lerida”—the former
being a cattle run and the latter
devoted to sheep—and on the
Northern stock routes, on which,
after reaching his late teens, he
became well known as a drover. He
continued droving as charge hand
for a lengthy period, among the
many trips which he successfully
accomplished being one which ex-
tended from Rockhampton to Nor-
rnanton, when he travelled a mob of
bulls for delivery at the Gulf town.
On the conclusion of the trip he
again devoted himself to station
work, filling positions both in the
Northern Territory and the Gulf
country. During this time, by thrift
and industry, he managed to acquire
sufficient capital to make an inde-
pendent start, and, with this
objective, he returned to Mackay.
Here he combined grazing pursuits
with the butchering trade, and Ins
undertakings have proved of so suc-
cessful a nature that for more than
tv/enty years he has been regarded as
one of the influential business men
of Mackay and a most practical and
public-spirited citizen. His support
can always be counted upon when
any project is mooted pro bono
publico, and he is keenly alive to the
interests of the town and district.
He lends his patronage to various
forms of outdoor recreation, patron-
ising sport for sport’s sake, and
always has at least one good horse
for entrance in local events. In the
year 1895 he married Annie,
daughter of Mr. W. Zunker, who
made his advent to Central Queens-
land in the early days. Mr. Gohdes
has a family of one son and three
daughters. His son, Harold Albert,
was born at Mackay on May 21,
1899, and there educated. On
leaving school he entered his father's
business, with the details of which he
soon became so familiar that he was
entrusted with the work of manage-
ment, and this now practically
devolves upon him, as Mr. Gohdes,
sen., is frequently absent from
Mackay in connection with his pas-
toral interests.

THE ATHERTON BROTHERS.
Of the families whose names are
most familiarly associated with the
early settlement and pastoral devel-
opment of Northern Queensland,
MR. T. A. ATHERTON.
none are worthier of honour for
pioneering achievement and fine
qualities of citizenship than that
of which THOMAS ARTHUR
ATHERTON of “Pretty Bend,”
MR. E. ATHERTON.
Bowen, is the head, and which is
represented in the Mackay district by
his brothers, ALBERT EDMUND
and PERCIVAL HENRY ATHER-
TON. These brothers are sons of
the late Edmund Atherton and
grandsons of Edmund Atherton, the
founder of the line in Australia, and
nephews to John Atherton, to whose
enterprise was due the opening up of
the districts outlying Atherton and
Herberton, the former town being
named after him. The first Edmund
Atherton hailed from Lancashire,
England, where he had been engaged
in farming pursuits. Lie was accom-
panied from the Old World by his
wife and seven children and reached
Australia in the year 1844, settling
in the Armidale district. Here,
on his property, “Baldblair,” he was
among the early pioneers of the pas-
toral industry, which, occupied his
energies in the Mother State for a
period of seventeen years. In 1860,
wishing to operate on a larger scale,
he removed to Queensland, where,
in that year, he depastured an area
near Rockhampton, having travelled
for the purpose a herd of 2,000
shorthorns overland from New
South Wales. On the same journey
the pioneer, who was preceded to the
north by his eldest and third sons,
James and Edmund, was accompan-
ied by his wife and seven remaining
children (the youngest of whom was
born in New South Wales), the
family -travelling with all their
household possessions, stores, etc., by
means of three bullock teams, a horse
team and on horseback. Edmund
Atherton, the head of the first gen-
eration of the name under the South-
ern Cross, died in the year 1863.
The property which he and his sons
formed was named “Mount Hedloo”
(now “Mount Hedlow”) and is still
in the family. His third son,
Edmund Atherton, the father of the
gentleman under review, was born
in England, and came to Australia
with his parents; and, subsequently,
on reaching manhood, proceeded to
Queensland, making his advent
thereto in 1857. For a time he was
associated with his relatives at
“Mount Lledlow,” but, in the year
1866, he overlanded with his house-
hold possessions conveyed in wag-
gons, and such of the stock from the
home pastures as were his own prop-
erty, to the Mackay district, and
took up his residence at “West Hill”
Station, Mr. Thomas A. Atherton
being at that time about six months
old. In the same district he acquired
in conjunction with the late Henry
Bell a tract of virgin country which
the partners formed into a cattle
station and named “Plane Creek,”
and with this station, on the site of
which afterwards sprang up the
town of Sarina and a thriving cane-
growing district, the Atherton
family was associated until the year
1872 f, when they bought the area

the Bells continuing to hold “Plane
Creek” and occupy the old home-
stead. Edmund Atherton carried
on operations with cattle and horses
until 1898, when his death occurred,


he, in the interim, having explored
and selected in conjunction with his
eldest son, Mr. T. A. Atherton, 400
square miles of virgin country on the
Smithburne River, 50 miles north of
from which centre they, in due
course, explored much of that then
practically unknown territory. Hav-
ing selected the block described, they
returned to “Cliftonville,” and

station, which the pioneer called
Midlothian in compliment to a
friend who hailed from the old Scot-
tish town, was a fine pastoral achieve-
merit and one which reflects the qual-
itics of courage and enterprise which
actuated the undertakings of both
father and son. The two set out on
their journey to the Gulf in the year

gathering together a herd of 1,700
started on the long road journey of
900 miles to the newly acquired run.
The trip, which lasted twelve months,
proved a disastrous one, many of the
cattle falling victims to drought con-
ditions and others to an outbreak of
pleura which occurred among the
herd, which was so depleted in con-
sequence that only 350 head arrived
sooner completed, than, leaving his
son, Thomas, in charge of the dim-
inished herd depastured at “Midlo-
thian,” he returned to “Cliftonville,”
and very shortly, with a herd of
1,000 breeders, was again on the
roads, arriving at “Midlothian”

at “Midlothian.” Edmund Ather-
ton was not a man to be easily
deterred when once he had put his
hand to the helm, and the strenuous
journey of a year’s duration, made
formed and its management was en-
trusted to him. He carried out the
duties of managing partner for ten
years, at the end of which he nur
chased his father’s interests and


continued to administer the area on
his own account. Edmund Atherton
was one of the first members of the
Plane Creek Central Milling Co.,
founded in the year 1893. THOMAS
ARTHUR ATHERTON, J.P., was
born at “Mount Hedlow” Station on
March 8, 1866, and educated at the
Boys’ Grammar School, Brisbane.
He discontinued his studies when at
the age of seventeen, and, returning
to “Cliftonville,” from there set out
with his father on the journey which
resulted in the acquirement of “Mid-
lothian,” in the Gulf country, as
already related. He held “Midlo-
thian” from 1885 until 1901, being
associated in the interim with hie
brother in the administration of
"Cliftonville” for a period, on behalf
of his father’s estate. He sold his
Gulf property with the stock in 1901,
and, having purchased “Woonon,”
one of the oldest and most historic
properties of the locality, from his
uncle, Mr. Richard Atherton, who
now resides at Yeerongpilly, near
Brisbane, transferred his energies to
the Mackay district. At this time
he also purchased “Kelvin Grove,”
and thenceforward' continued to
occupy himself with pastoral pursuits
in the coastal portion of the South
Kennedy district until the year 1916,
in the interval acquiring interests
also„ in different sugar ventures.
With the view of providing a larger
sphere of operations for his sons, he
finally sold out his Mackay interests
and purchased in the Bowen district
a pastoral property named “Pretty
Bend,” which was formed in the very
early days of settlement there. Two
years later, in 1918, his ownership
was extended to “Belmore Downs,”
a property lying thirty miles from
"Pretty Bend,” which occupies a
site distant thirty-four miles from
Bowen. “Pretty Bend” constitutes
240 square miles of fine breeding
country, its nature being chiefly indi-
cated by iron bark ridges and gum
tree flats. It merits its reputation
as one of the best watered runs on
the coast, for the Don River courses
right through its centre and provides
excellent supplies for the stock.
"Belmore Downs” is used as a fat-
tening area, and the 18,000 acres
which it embraces are eminently
suited for the purpose. The prop-
erty recently passed into the owner-
ship of Mr. T. A. Atherton’s two
eldest sons, who, on his behalf,
direct operations on “Pretty Bend”
also, their father thus being free,
after a long and energetic career, to

evidenced by the public spiritedness
which causes him to be regarded as
one of the most useful citizens of the
district. At time of writing he has
a seat on the Wangaratta Shire
Council and is a prominent member
of the Pastoral, Agricultural and
Mining Association. He is also one of
th© body constituting the Marsupial
Board. A whole-hearted supporter of
furthering the interests of the Mac-
kay Turf Club, and for ten years a
member of the Normanton Jockey
Club, while at time of writing he is
the president of the Bowen Turf
Club. His public life in the past
embraced a decade in the course of
which he continued to be a member of
the Normanby Shire Council, and a
considerable period during which he
was associated in membership with
the Mackay Harbour Board and the
local Shire Council. Mr. Atherton
has many interesting reminiscences
of early life in Queensland when pas-
toral settlement was accomplished in
the face of indescribable hardships
fully armed, while even within
the dwelling it was necessary to
be continually on the alert against
an unexpected attack, and that in a
day’s ride it was a common thing to
find a dozen cattle that had been
wantonly speared. He married in
the year 1895, Jane, daughter of Mr.
John Bardsley, who, for over forty
years, was engaged in mercantile
pursuits in Queensland, and, now
in his eighty-fifth year, is able to look
back upon a past brimful of incidents
which throw much light on the con-
ditions under which settlement was
advanced when the present State was
yet under twenty years a Colony.
Mr. Bardsley, always a keen student
of human nature, is well versed in
literature and a good conversation-
alist. Of the union of Mr. and Mrs.
Atherton there is a family of three
sons and two daughters. The two
eldest sons, Frederick Arthur and
Edmund, born in Normanton in the
years 1896 and 1898 respectively and
educated at the Toowoomba Gram-
mar School, are now engaged in
the management of ‘ Pretty Bend”
and “Belmore Downs” in their own
and their father’s interests. At the
age of eighteen, the younger,
Edmund, joined the Australian
Imperial Forces during the Great
War 1914-18, and in the firing line
worthily upheld the honour of the
old pioneering family of which he is
a member. Henry Stuart Atherton

ton, is a student of All Souls Col-

he is one of the committee governing
affairs in the interests of the Bowen
General Hospital. He has always
extended a hearty patronage to
clean sport, for a number of years
having been prominently active in
and deadly hostility from the abor-
igines, who were very numerous in
the districts outlying Rockhampton
and also in the Gulf country, and he
relates that it would have been
deemed madness to move out of sight

EDMUND ATHERTON, J.P.,
“Cliftonville,” Mackay, is the second
son of the late Edmund Atherton
and was born, where he now resides,
on May 13, 1873, and educated at
the Toowoomba Grammar School. On
his return to the parental rooftree,


he entered upon the administration
of “Cliftonville,” as his elder brother
was then occupied with the working
of “Midlothian” and his father
engaged in the direction of other of
his interests. “Cliftonville” was
carried on as a purely pastoral con-
cern until the year 1895, being then,
as were many of the neighbouring
grazing properties, partially devoted
to the culture of cane for the Plane
Creek Sugar Mill, then recently
erected under the Sugar Works
Guarantee Act passed in 1893, and
the auspices of the company formed
in that year, of which his father, Mr.
Edmund Atherton, was a member.
For some time Mr. A. E. Atherton
continued to grow cane on “Clifton-
ville” as the manager of the property
after his father’s demise, finally, on
the death of his mother, purchasing
the area in conjunction with his
brother, Mr. P. H. Atherton, from
the late Edmund Atherton’s estate.
The brothers continued to carry on
pastoral and sugar-growing pursuits
at “Cliftonville” until a dissolu-
tion of partnership and a division
of the property was mutually agreed
upon, Mr. A. E. Atherton retaining
those lands devoted to sugar-grow-
ing and his brother the pastoral
area. Mr. A. E. Atherton has ’
actively interested himself in public
affairs, having been a member of the
Sarina Shire Council since its incep-
tion, and for the last twenty years,
a director of the Plane Creek
Central Milling Co. He has
exercised the Commission of the
Peace for a considerable num-
ber of years, having been gazetted
under the Philp Administration.
In the year 1900 he married Char-
lotte Isabel, daughter of Mr. F. M,
Black, who for considerably more
than a quarter of a century has been
associated with mercantile pursuits
in Mackay. Of the union there
is a family of twm sons and two
daughters. PERCIVAL HENRY
ATHERTON was also born at
‘Cliftonville ’ and educated at
the Toowoomba Grammar School,
and like his brothers, on the conclu-
sion of his school career, entered
upon a life of pastoral activity. The
staple industry of the State has
since chiefly claimed his energies,
which for many years were directed
towards the further improvement of
Cliftonville,” where he devoted
some time also to sugar production.
His property, “Eversleigh,” was
foi med from part of the origi-
nal “Cliftonville” area, as already

mentioned. Mr. P. H. Atherton
married in the year 1894, Jean
Eleanor, daughter of the late
J. C. Binney, who during his
lifetime l ranked as one of the
most highly esteemed of the few
remaining pioneers of Mackay and
its district. Born in County
Down, Ireland, in the year 1842,
the late gentleman left his native
land for Australia when still a youth
and arrived in Melbourne in the
year 1858. For three years he lived
in the Ovens River district, Victoria,
in 1861 coming to Queensland with
the late Hon. (then Mr.) John
Arthur Macartney, the well-known
Queensland pioneer of the fifties,
to whom he was related, and who
had then recently stocked “Waver-
ley’’ Station, a Queensland coastal
property. Mr. Binney took up his
residence at “Waverley” and thence-
forward for some years was closely
identified with the early pastoral
history of the State, having assisted
in the formation of “Bowen Downs,"
“St. Helens” and “Bloomsbury"
Stations. Much of the droving of
those early days was accomplished
under his leadership, and to him
belonged the distinction of having
planted the first cane grown at
“Pleystowe," where he was asso-
ciated with Messrs. Jewitt and
Romilly. His entry into the sugar
industry in 1867 was followed by his
participation in the formation erf
‘Branscombe" Plantation for Messrs.
Martin & Long. Subsequently,
Messrs. Meynell & Rawson, owners
of the Hermitage, secured his ser-
vices as manager of a butchering
business in Mackay, where, in 1871,
he was afterwards appointed first
secretary of the local hospital. Five
years later, he accepted the position
of Town Clerk of Mackay, which he
held until 1882. He rendered yeo-
man service to the district as first
clerk and engineer of the Pioneer
Shire Council, continuing in office
until 1884, when he left the district
on a visit to the Old World. In
1891, two years after his return to
Mackay, he was re-appointed to the
secretaryship of the hospital, and
still held the position in 1912, when
his almost continuous association
with the institution in a secretarial
capacity dated forty years back. His
kindly personality made for him a
host of friends and his death, which
occurred in Brisbane in the year
1917, after a short illness, caused
universal regret in the town with
which he had been for so long asso-
ciated.

Lascelles, nee Murray, and is thus
descended from two noble families of
England, the distaff side of the house
being traceable in a direct line to the
first Earl of Mansfield, Lord Chief
Justice of the Court of King’s Bench,
who received his rank in the peerage
in the year 1775. His mother was a
daughter of the. fourth Earl of Mans-
field. The Lascelles family, which has
notably participated in the persons
of its many gifted members in the
political and military life of Great
Britain, is allied by marriage with the
Hamilton, Thynne, Balfour and
other noble families. It was estab-
lished among the nobility of Eng-
land in the eighteenth century. In
the year 1796, Edward Lascelles,
heir at law of Edwin Lascelles, and a
direct progenitor of Mr. Lascelles of
“Goorganga,” was created a peer of
Great Britain as Baron Harewood of

first Earl of Harewood was, previous
to 1796, a noted member of the
British House of Commons, having
represented North Allerton in several
Parliaments. His son, Henry, the
second earl and great-grandfather
of the subject of this memoir
was Lord-Lieutenant of West
Riding, York, and was also the
third earl, who married Lady Louisa
Thynne, daughter of the Marquis of
Bath. The late Hon. George Edwin
Lascelles, the third son of the third
earl, was born in the year 1826, and
the branch of the family which owes
to him its descent has been repre-
sented in the Army and political life
of the Empire and has contributed
several members to the ministry of

Mr. E. George Lascelles was edu-
cated at the Richmond Grammar
School, a famous Public School of
Yorkshire. On concluding his studies
there he accompanied the late Hon.
Harold Finch Hatton to Australia,
where it was his intention to gain
experience in the pastoral industry
at “Mt. Spencer” Station in the dis-
trict outlying Mackay, Northern
Queensland. Here he arrived in
due course, and entered upon the
duties of “jackaroo,” the term
usually applied to those who seek pas-
toral employment chiefly with the
view of obtaining the experience nec-
essary to justify the expenditure of
capital in the industry. The period
of nearly three years which he spent
at “Mt. Spencer” resulted in his
gaining a good knowledge of the
practical and administrative work of
a station, and at the end of that time
he launched into the industry on his
own account, purchasing “Mt. Pleas-
ant,” which he devoted to horned
stock and held for very many years,
considerably developing it and in-
augurating improvements which yet
testify to the value of his pioneer-
ing work. He purchased “Goor-
ganga” in 1910, and for the following
six years divided time between this
station and “Mt. Pleasant.” In
1916 he sold the latter so as to be
Tree to devote himself exclusively to
“Goorganga,” which property of
many historical associations has since
been his headquarters. It was origin-
ally taken up by Messrs. Harry Dan-
gar and Frederick Bode, both of
whom were notably identified with
the pastoral development of North-
ern Queensland in the early days,
the first mentioned having hailed
from New South Wales, where the
name has been to the fore in pastoral
affairs since the year 1822, which wit-
nessed the advent to the Mother
State of the late Henry Dangar, who
afterwards figured also in parlia-
mentary life as a member of the New
South Wales Legislative Council.
From Mr. Frederick Bode it passed
to Mr. A. J. Cotton, his son-in-law,

part of the “Goorganga” run, until
his death, which occurred at the

passed from Mr. Cotton to Mr. W.

VIVIAN ARTHUR TOMS, M.M.
and Bar, is the eldest son of Mr.
William Henry Toms of “Moss
Vale,” Bowen, where he was born on
October 15, 1886. The family was
MR. W. H. TOMS.
founded in Australia by the grand-
father of the subject of this memoir,
Thomas Charles Toms, who settled in
New South Wales nearly three-
quarters of a century ago. The late
MR. C. V. TOMS.
T. C. Toms was formerly attached to
the service of an old family which
ranked among the nobility of Eng-
land, but the prospect of improving
his circumstances in the young
Continent under the Southern Cross,
caused him, for the sake of his chil-
dren, to relinquish the comforts of
an older civilization for the unknown
hardships incidental to Empire ex-
tension. His example as a- pioneer
of the Mother State was followed by
his son, William Henry, who, born
in Madron, Cornwall, on May 20,
1840, was brought by his relatives to
Port Jackson, New South Wales, in
February 1849, the voyage being
accomplished by the ship “Har-
binger.” Mr. W. 11. Toms accom-
panied his father to Yass, and subse-
quently, in 1852, became an emplove
of Mr. John Badgery of “Vine
Lodge,” Sutton Forest. After eleven
years’ service with the Badgery fam-
ily Fate directed his steps to Rock-
hampton, Central Queensland,
where, as second in charge, he joined
a droving party on the eve of starting
out with the second lot of cattle des-
patched to “St. Ann’s,” a station
then in course of formation in the
vicinity of Bowen. His arrival at
this run in the early sixties was fol-
lowed by periods spent at “Mt.
Wyatt” and “Natal Downs” Sta-
tions, his connection with the latter
terminating in 1867, when he ten-
dered for and secured the contract
for the conveyance of pack mails be-
tween Bowen and “Bowen Downs.”
While operating on the Bowen-
“ Bowen Downs” route, his contract
involved a fortnightly service of 750
miles divided into, approximately
fifty-five miles a day. Thus, contin-
ually in the saddle, he endured the
evils of constant exposure to intense
heat or torrential downpours, the
deprivation of suitable food, the un-
ceasing strain of watchfulness against
treacherous attacks from the blacks,
and many other hardships which in
due course undermined a formerly
fine constitution. From 1872-4,
having advanced in the calling he
had chosen, he held contracts for the
delivery of mails between Bowen,
Ravenswood, Dalrymple and “Rich-
mond Downs”; and from 1871-4, be-
tween Cardwell, Lyndhurst, Bowen
and Mackay. Later, he took over the
mail service between Bowen and
Nebo. In 1872, finding it necessary
to have a. depot for his horses, he
took up a selection, and in time
adding to this area, formed his pres-
ent station, which he designated
“Moss Vale,” after the New South
Wales town of the name. From his
boyhood onwards, Mr. Toms has been
noted as an expert horseman. In
his youthful years he distinguished
himself both in flat and hurdle
events at Sutton Forest, Moss
Vale, Bung Bung and other New
South Wales centres, and later sim-
ilarly made a name for himself at
MR. V. A. TOMS.
Bowen meetings. At the date of its
inception in October, 1879, he be-
came a member of the Wangaratta
Divisional Board, to which he was
frequently re-elected until 1896,
MR. W. J. TOMS.
when he finally retired. He was a
most enthusiastic supporter of the
Bowen Pastoral, Agricultural and
Mining Association and of the Bowen
Turf Club, when these bodies were


in their infancies; and for over half
a century he has been a Freemason,
having been initiated a member of
the Kennedy Lodge, 1175, E. C.,
Bowen, in 1869. He married Mary
Ellen Farrell, an adopted daughter
of the late John Henry Clark, who
was one of the best known of North-
ern Queensland pioneers and erst-
while owner of “Lornesleigh,” in the
district outlying Charters Towers.
Of the union there is a family of
three sons and a daughter. The
latter, Myra Elizabeth, resides at the
old “Moss Vale” homestead with her
parents and elder brothers, who both
follow the pastoral industry. Vivian
Arthur Toms was educated in Bowen
and Townsville, and discontinued his
studies in the year 1901, being then
at the age of fifteen. From early
childhood he has been more or less
associated with work among stock,
and on the completion of his school
career settled seriously to the indus-
try under his father at “Moss Vale, ;
where he continued to assist in the
work and administration of the run
until the year 1916. At that time the
need of the Empire for men to carry
to a successful issue the Great War
in which his youngest brother was
then already assisting as a member of
the Australian Navy, became imper-
ative, and accordingly he volunteered
for active service. It was not long
before he took his place at the West-
ern Front, where, as a member of the
12th Machine Gun Company, he
served through many engagements,
including those fought at Ypres,
Messines, Paschendaele, Villers
Bretonneux, the Somme, and right
into the Hindenburg Line. At Mes-
sines his service won for him the Mil-
itary Medal; and his conduct on the
Hindenburg Line gained the added
distinction of a bar to the decora-
tion. With the cessation of hostili-
ties and his discharge from the Army,
he returned to “Moss Vale,” where
he has since been engaged in assist-
ing in the work of administration
of the amalgamated properties em-
braced in that holding. Charles Ver-
non Toms, the second son of the
pioneer, who was born in Bowen on
February 27, 1893, spent several
years at Charters Towers and Bath-
hurst in the pursuance of his schol-
astic education, on the conclusion of
which he went through a special
course of training at the Queensland
Agricultural College, Gatton. It was
his lot to render the necessary
assistance to his father during
the absence of his brother in
France. William John, the young-
est son of the family, was born
in Bowen on August 29, 1899,
and there educated. He entered
the Australian Navy in March
of the year 1915, and, serving in the
Mediterranean in the torpedo des-
troyer, “Swan,” participated in the
naval operations of the Great War.
Still attached to the Service, he, at
time of writing, holds non-commis-
sioned rank on the H.M.A.S.
“Sydney.” “Moss Vale,” which
comprises some 60 odd miles of open
forest country intersected by creeks
which provide an excellent water
supply, is made up of both leasehold
and freehold lands and is devoted to
breeding and fattening purposes.
Several wells provide additional
water for the stock and the run is
otherwise well developed. The home-
stead is situated within 28 miles of
railway communication, a station on
the Bowen coalfields is only four
miles distant. Standing to-day as
typical of the old bush homes, its
solidity speaks well for the work pro-
duced in the pioneer times of which
it is reminiscent, and its comfort
compares favourably with many
dwellings of more modern architec-
ture.
The GILLHAM BROTHERS
have by their energy and enterprise
made their name prominent in
pastoral circles of Northern Queens-
land. They are sons of the late
THOMAS WHEELER GILL-
HAM, who for many years was
prominently known in the Leich-
hardt district as the owner of
“Rookwood,” an historical holding
taken up in the sixties. The late
gentleman was the founder of this
family in Australia. Born in Rut-
landshire in the year 1840, and a
member of a well-known family of
that County, he was a son of the
Rev. Gillham, who was the vicar of
Liddington-cum-Caldicott for forty
years. Ere coming to Queensland
Mr. Gillham was attached to the
army as an officer of the 34th Foot
—known as the Cumberland Regi-
ment—in India. He arrived in the
State in the year 1862 with a
brother officer, Mr. R. Newton, who
afterwards became a well-known
Brisbane citizen, and choosing the
bush in which to carve a career,
devoted a few years to obtaining the
experience necessary for success in
any form of pastoral enterprise, his
personality and ability shortly sing-
ling him out for the position of
manager of “Rookwood” Station.
This property was then devoted to
sheep, for which its pastures were
quite unsuitable, and the early years
of his connection with it were
marked by the trials, anxieties, and
hardships which were the lot of the
early pastoralists who so dearly
bought the experience by which
later comers profited. Being a man
of strong though quiet personality,
a fine bushman, resourceful, and
possessed of exceptional hardihood,
he proved equal to the fight with
adverse conditions, and, having
absolute faith in the property’s
potentialities, after a few years qf
management, became its owner. In
that capacity he immediately in-
augurated the necessary improve-
ments for its conversion into a cattle
concern, and, eliminating the
sheep, shortly had the area depas-
tured with horned stock. He also
went in for horse breeding and con-
tinued to personally administer
“Rookwood” for some years, eventu-
ally handing over its control to his
eldest son and namesake, who is now
engaged in pastoral pursuits in the
Maranoa district. Mr. Gillham was
one of the first pastoralists of the
Leichhardt district to adopt the
policy of “letting the blacks in”-—a
phrase indicating the employment of
aborigines in the days when they
constituted a serious menace to the
lives of the settlers of the Isaacs
River district. It was considered
that his influence with the blacks
was remarkable, though many of his
neighbours predicted disaster from a
bold move of this nature. He, how-
ever, relied on the effect of his own
integrity, absence of fear, kindness
and firmness on the minds of a race
which, he realized, held among a
strange admixture of traditions,
savage and normal, a high concep-
tion of morality and justice. In the
year 1872 he visited the Old
Country where he married. On giv-
ing up the management of “Rook-
wood” he took up his residence at
“Eulabury,” a freehold property
near Glen Innis, New South Wales.
Here he made his home for nine
years, finally removing to Too-
woomba, where, at his residence
“Kim ora,” West Street, his death


occurred. He is survived by a
widow, seven sons, and four daugh-
ters. Of the three sons with whom
tliis article chiefly deals, Messrs.

Gillham, was born in Rockhampton

on February 20, 1882, and educated
chiefly at “Rookwood” under
tutorial supervision. His studies
under the parental rooftree were
followed by a course of training at
the Queensland Agricultural Col-
lege, Gatton, to fit him for the
career it was intended he should
follow. At the age of after
completing two years’ study at
Gatton, he returned to “Rookwood,”
where he became engaged in assist-
ing his father and Mr. T. J. Gill-
ham, the eldest son of the pioneer,
in the work and administration of
that station. Towards the end of
1902 he proceeded to New South
Wales and took over the adminis-
tration of “Eulabury,” which was
devoted to sheep grazing and mixed
farming. For five years he remained
at “Eulabury,” in 1907 returning
to the North to seek wider interests
than those comprised in the New
MR. F. E. GILLHAM.
England property. His first essay
independent of his family was made
with the acceptance of the position
of head stockman of the well-known
“Saltbush Park” Station, owned by
the late John Shannon, on whose
behalf he continued to carry out the
duties incidental to his post for the
following three years. The advent
of 1911 found him prepared to join
the ranks of the pastoral land-
owners, and in that year, in con-
junction with his brother, Edward,
he purchased “Suitor Creek” Sta-
tion, to which, as one of the oldest
properties in the South Kennedy
district, are attached many historical
associations. Of this property he
assumed control immediately after
its acquirement, and its further
development and general adminis-
tration occupied him until the year
1918, when he widened the sphere of
his activities by the purchase of

years engaged in the full manage-

joint interests. Adjoining “Conway”


is a property equivalent in
acreage which was taken up by Air.
Benjamin C. Gillham. The two
areas are worked as a single proposi-
tion and cover considerably over
100,000 acres that are devoted to
cattle raising for which the ridgy
forest country comprising it is
admirably suited. Both the “Con-
way'’ and “Suttor Creek” herds are
composed of shorthorns, that of the
former and the adjoining run gener-
ally averaging a strength in the
region of 4,000, and having been
raised from stock bred on “Suttor
Creek.” The “Suttor Creek” herd
was built up from “Plevna” stock
and bulls introduced from the best
Southern studs whose progeny here
and on the “Conway” properties are
uniformly big-framed and well-
developed animals, which, fattened
for the markets, average a weight
varying from 850 to 900 lbs. “Con-
way” lies slightly less than 120 miles
from Bowen, which is the port for
the property, and is well improved,
carrying on each of the blocks com-
prised within its boundaries a con-
siderable amount of fencing. “Suttor
Creek” is chiefly of the class of
country described as open forest, and
slightly superior to “Conway” as a
cattle proposition, being partly
made up of undulating downs inter-
spersed with patches of brigalow and
other timber. It is highly developed,
particularly in regard to water
supply, which is made available to
the stock by the aid of five mills and
six engines, most of the improve-
ments in this direction having been
carried out since the advent of the
Gillham Bros, as owners. The mills
are of both Alston and Comet makes.
Besides the boundary fences there
are subdivisional erections running
to thirty miles and enclosing four
paddocks, the “Conway” blocks
carrying an equivalent mileage of
fencing. Mr. Gillham has devoted
much time and attention to the
breeding of a good class of horse-
flesh, both blood and draught stock
coming under this department of his
operations, in which he has been
rewarded with such success that the
demand for his horses in the Indian
and local markets is always greater
than the supply. The stallion at
present in use is “Stocklad,” a fine
sire whose every outline bespeaks
purity of breeding. “Stocklad’s”
progeny, now reaching maturity, are
of excellent promise. Situated on a

the late John Kelly, who was a
native of New South Wales. John
Kelly was a son of Patrick Kelly,
the latter having been among the
Isle of which only traditional records
are preserved. Mr. J. E. Kelly con-
cluded his education at the age of
sixteen, when he immediately became
identified with butchering and graz-
ing pursuits under his father, who
was interested in both these branches
of pastoral enterprise. He contin-
ued to assist the late John Kelly
until reaching man’s estate, when he
struck out for himself in the dairy-
ing industry, which, working on
scientific lines, he followed until,
realizing the better remunerative
possibilities of the trade to which he
had been trained, he relinquished
dairying to accept a position in the
business of the late John H. Isbell
of Bowen, where he arrived and en-
tered upon his duties in the year 1897.
After something under a year spent
with Mr. Isbell he accepted a similar
position with a firm then known as
E. W. McKenzie & Cos., and which
afterwards conducted business under
the title of F. G. Champion & Cos.
For six years he managed this bus-
iness on behalf of his principals, for
whom his operations were eminently
successful, so much so that he was
encouraged to make a start on his
own account. This he did in part-
nership with the late J. H. Cross,

Edward Ashford Staubrough, who
was born in Isleworth, Middlesex,
England, and a member of a family
which in his native County had been
long connected with banking and
milling pursuits. The late gentle-
man was apprenticed to the black-
smithing trade in Toowoomba after
his arrival in his adopted country,
and engaged in that calling, which
he followed almost up to the time of
his death. Mr. Kelly has a family

CHIDLEY RICHARD CROF-
TON, J.P., “Hazelton,” Ayr, was
born at Bowen Terrace, Brisbane, on
April 22, 1873, and is the eldest son
of the late Charles James Crofton,
MR. C. J. CROFTON, SEN.
who, for many years, was well known
in Queensland banking circles, hav-
ing been engaged in the management
of the Bowen branch of the Austra-
lian Joint Stock Bank (now the Aus-
tralian Bank of Commerce, Ltd,) at
the time of Mr. C. R. Crofton’s
birth. The first representative of
the family to reach Australia was
its founder, Chidley J ohn Crofton,
the late gentleman’s father, who,
in October, 1833, arrived from Eng-
land, and, proceeding to Maitland,
settled in the pastoral industry at
“Dunmore,” where he resided until
the time of his death thirty-four
years later. Chidley John Crofton
was the eldest son of Captain John
Crofton, who was an officer of the
British Army and whose name
appears in service records in Ireland
at the time of the rebellion of 1798.
Tradition points to the fact that the
Crofton family was established in
England at the time of the Crusades.
In the reign of Mary its seat was in
Kent, whence the ancestors of the
gentleman under review being, as
Protestants, in conflict with the
religious views of that monarch, fled
to Saxony. There was born their
son, John Crofton, who was destined
to found a branch of the family in
Ireland, for in Elizabeth’s reign he
accompanied the Earl of Essex to
that country, where he was ap-
pointed Auditor and Escheator
General to the Queen. This John
Crofton obtained under Elizabeth
large grants of land in the Counties
of Roscommon and Leitrim. Many
members of the Crofton family have
served in British Parliaments, while
others have been prominent in the
legal profession and filled high
offices of State, as is clearly set
forth in the“Crofton Memoirs” and
other authentic works which carry
its history forward from the fifteenth
century. The late Chidley John
Crofton, the first head of the Austra-
lian branch of the family, was twice
married. He was survived by four-
teen children and of the issue of the
second marriage, the late Charles
MR. C. E. CROFTON.
James Crofton was the eldest. The
latter gentleman was born at ‘‘Dun-
more.” When still a youth he
joined the staff of the Australian
Joint Stock Bank at Newcastle,
New South Wales, whence he was
transferred to Bowen, Northern
Queensland. Here he continued to
be associated with the Bank in a
managerial capacity until the year
1870, when he resigned to join the
firm of Warry & Co. of that town.
Some time later, relinquishing mer-
cantile pursuits, he re-entered the
Bank’s service, opening a branch of
the institution at Charters Towers.
Towards the end of the seventies,
finally dissociating himself with
banking business, he entered upon a
pastoral career, having selected a
holding near Bowen called “Marie
Vale.” He subsequently increased
his landed interests by the acquire-
ment from the late John Clarke of
“Mount Pleasant” Station, a very
w T ell-known property in the owner-
ship of which he was afterwards
joined in partnership by Mr. E. G.
Lascelles, with whom he continued
to be associated until the date of his
death in the year 1890, when Mr.
Lascelles became sole owner of
“Mount Pleasant.” He married
Marie Anne, daughter of the late
R. S. Warry, who was one of the
early merchants of Brisbane, and,
later, a pioneer of commerce in
Bowen. At his death, Mr. Crofton
was survived by three sons and four
daughters. Mr. Chidley R. Crof-
ton, his eldest son, proceeded from
the Ipswich Grammar School, where
his earlier education was received,
to Newington College, Sydney, and
there completed his collegiate career.
From school he proceeded to Bris-
bane, where he entered the English,
Scottish and Australian Chartered
Bank, and, at the end of two years,
having gained a commercial train-
ing likely to stand him in good stead,
relinquished his position to asso'-
ciate himself with landed pursuits.
He secured a position in the grazing
industry and thenceforward was

occupied as stockman, book-keeper
overseer and manager in turn,
until, in the year 1901, he
made his advent to the district
watered by the Lower Burdekin.


Here, under Mr. Drysdale, he occu-
pied the post of storekeeper at the
Pioneer Mill for three years, at the
end of which he was apjjointed to
the position of field manager. He
continued with Mr. Drysdale for
seven years, in 1908 relinquishing
his duties to make a start in the in-
dustry on his own account on a farm
which he leased for the purpose.
Eventually he purchased his present
holding, which comprises nearly 150
acres and is devoted solely to
sugar production. He has prom-
inently participated in affairs of
communal import, entering public
life in the year 1918 as a councillor of
the No. 3 Division of the Ayr Shire,
having been chairman of the Council
since the year 1919, a position he
now occupies. He is an executive
officer of the Lower Burdekin Farm-
ers’ Association and a committeeman
of the local Pastoral Agricultural
and Industrial Association. As a
member of the Ayr Turf Club he
lends his patronage to clean sport.
In the year 1903 he married Eva
Agnes, daughter of the late George
Porter, and had issue two daughters,
the younger of whom, Mavis Alex-
ander, died in the year 1920, when
was descended from a family which
has been indirectly associated with
the settlement of the Island Con-
tinent from a very early date in
its history, his grandfather, James

to the New Continent. This James
Porter married a daughter of an-
other East India Company’s Cap-
tain, and of him it is recorded
that on one occasion, while tra-
velling with a valuable load of
spices, he was attacked by pirates,
who, after looting his vessel prepared
to take his life, sparing it, however,
at the earnest entreaties of his wife.
The family was not actually estab-
lished under the Southern Cross
until the year 1853, when James
Porter, a civil engineer and
draughtsman, son of the Captain
Porter above mentioned, arrived in
New South Wales by the sailing
ship, “Plantagenet.” This gentle-
man was accompanied by his wife
and children, one of whom was the
late George Porter, Mrs. Crofton’s
father. Ten years later, while man-
ager of Mort’s Dock, Sydney, James
Porter was accidentally killed when
firing a salute in commemoration of
the marriage of King Edward VII.
—then Prince of Wales. The late
George Porter, after identifying him-
self with different avocations in his
adopted land, finally settled to pas-
toral pursuits at “Boongoondoo”
Station. Here he did much to

third son of Mr. J. H. Delpratt,
a memoir of whose career will be
found on page 320, Vol. 1., of this
work. Educated under the paternal
rooftree, Mr. C. N. Delpratt, when
not engaged under his tutors, found
recreation in assisting in the outdoor
work of the station, and thus
assimilated a very thorough know-
ledge of the great industry which
was to eventually form the basis of
his own career. When at the age of
nineteen he struck out for himself by
taking a position as head stockman
in the service of
Messrs. Collins on
“Westgrove,” a
station in the Daw-
son River district.
He remained here
for ten years,
finally relinquishing
his position in
order to join Mr.
F. L. White, the
owner of “Brook-
lands,” a property
in the Logan
River watershed, in
the purchase of
“Kirknie,” which he has since
continued to administer as manag-
ing partner, being associated in this
work with Mr. Eric Leslie Quarter-
maine, who, at a comparatively
recent date, was admitted into the
firm. “Kirknie” was originally
taken up by the late J. G. Mac-
donald in the year 1861, and its
boundaries embrace 70,000 acres
of excellent cattle country. The

“blazed the track” in Northern
Queensland in the early sixties. The
great company of pioneers—most of
whom have long since departed
who first formed holdings in the vast
wilderness of the great North-east,
included such men as the late James
Hall-Scott, Edward Cunningham,
the Allinghams, and Robert Towns.
Like the pioneer Macmillan, these
men forsook the ease and luxuries of
civilization to build the Empire in
lonely places, and, like him, had
their being in the land of the heather
—a land which has sent her sons to
take a foremost place in peaceful
settlement as well as in the ranks
of armies wherever the British flag
has been raised. Few had a more
varied career than the founder of the
family now represented at “Lochin-
var,” and none played their parts
more worthily in the work of
the country’s early development,
accomplished during a period which
witnessed gigantic strides in the in-
dustrial history of the North. Well
may his achievements be recorded as

those of a courageous explorer, a dis-
tinguished engineer, and an enter-
prising pastoralist. Born on Decem-
ber 27, 1840, at Oban, Scotland, he is
the second son of John and Anne
Barbara Macmillan {nee Campbell).
John Macmillan belonged to an old
Scottish family, as his name denotes,
and had his home at “Bell na
Fettach,” Lorne, Argyllshire. His
wife was a daughter of Colonel
Collin-Campbell, of the 42nd Gordon
Highlanders, and a niece of General
Campbell, of “Knock,” a property
that once formed a portion of the
Duke of Argyll’s estate, but which
afterwards passed to the branch of
the family of which General Camp-
bell, who subsequently disposed of it,
was head. The Campbells of
“Knock” were cousins of the Duke,
so it will be seen that Mr. A.
Campbell Macmillan could claim
descent from one of the noblest and
most historic lines of Scotland—a
line that has figured notably in song
and story from the times when
minstrelsy beguiled the gatherings in

age of twenty-three, arriving at his

destination in the third year of the
sixties. Very shortly after his
advent to the country of his adoption
he was appointed to a position under
the Government of Queensland as
Engineer for Public Roads. His
manner of carrying out the duties
incidental to this post, subsequently,
during the year of his arrival,
caused a further recognition of his
ability in the shape of an offer from
the same Government of the leader-
ship of an expedition into the Far
North for the purpose of opening up
country suitable for settlement by
forming roads and erecting bridges.
In pursuance of this objective, he set
out from Rockhampton towards the
end of 1863, and, working his way
to the Gulf, opened up the Palmer
goldfields (where he was presented
with one of the first nuggets found
on the field), and named Cooktown,
after the great navigator who gave
its name to the Endeavour River on
which the town is situated, Maytown
and other Northern centres, and
several rivers, including the Laura,
which is west of Cooktown, and from
which the town on its bank is called.
After about four years spent in
exploratory work in the North, he
settled in Bowen, where, in 1867, he
was appointed to a post which
involved the supervision of Govern-
ment Works and which carried a
salary of £l,OOO per year. For the
following ten years he continued to
devote his ability to the further
development of the State through
the medium of his profession, resid-
ing during this period at “Lornes-
leigh,” his Bowen home. About
1877, he resigned from the Civil
Service in order to enter upon landed
pursuits, to which end he took up a
large area of country on the Lower
Burdekin River. His acquirement
proved excellently suited to both
stock-raising and sugar-growing, both
of which forms of industry he carried
on individually until 1881, when he
formed the Burdekin Delta Sugar
Co. with a capital of £150,000. He
inaugurated operations on behalf of
this company, of which he was
manager and a large shareholder,
by putting 1,500 acres of the land
devoted to its interests under cane
and erecting thereon a large mill.
The property was named the ‘‘Aird-
millan” Estate, and consisted of
20,000 acres of freehold and large
areas of leasehold lands. On those

had a high conception of the duties
of citizenship and was prominently
associated with various movements
of a progressive character, particu-
larly those tending to the advance-
ment of the district in which his
interests were centred for so many
years, or the welfare of the com-
munity. Early-day pastoralists and
selectors on the western side of the
Burdekin had much reason to thank
him for his enterprise in building a
low level bridge across the river to
obviate the difficulties of provisioning
and when further deteriorated,
causing a good deal of sickness,
Among the bodies in which he
rendered valued service, pro bona
publico, is the Ayr Shire Council,
of which he was the first chairman,
a capacity in which he acted for
many years. Mr. A. Campbell
Macmillan married in the year 1867
Laura Bows, daughter of Mr. Philip
Lyndon Poingdestre, formerly of
St. Tidier, Jersey. He died at
“Airdmillan” on October 5, 1905,
aiid was survived by this lady, four
sons and a daughter. On the
maternal side, also, Mr. Macmillan,
of “Lochinvar,” is descended from a
the opportunity of adding to the
knowledge of horned stock gained in
childhood and of acquiring experi-
ence of the sugar industry as con-
ducted on the home acres. After
three years of banking experience he
devoted himself to pastoral affairs at
“Airdmillan” for a brief period,
working under his father until
appointed to the management of the
“Seaforth” Estate, a sugar property
in the Ayr district. This position he
occupied for three years, relinquish-
ing it to undertake the control of
“Lochinvar,” in which he had
then recently purchased an interest.
Previously, “Lochinvar” had been
their holdings and conveying to them
other necessaries, as previously,
during the sixties and seventies, the
impossibility which often existed of
securing the services of a carrier—the
majority of the trade then making
the goldfields their objectives, owing
to the heavy rates of carriage they
were able to demand—rendered their
position precarious in regard to food;
and they were forced to keep on hand
many months’ supplies, which, long

military family, his mother (formerly
Miss Poingdestre) having been the
daughter of Mary Eleanor Agnes,
only child of Major James Agnew.
Mr. M. L. Macmillan received his
education at the Townsville Grammar
School, continuing to study there
until reaching the age of eighteen.
Exchanging his college for a banking
career, he then joined the staff of the
Bank of Queensland with the view of
obtaining commercial experience
likely to prove an asset to him in
future pastoral undertakings. While
engaged in the bank’s service he lived
at the old “Airdmillan” home, and,
in his spare time was thus afforded
ill the ownership of the late Edward
Mytton, Mrs. M, L. Macmillan’s
father, and his partner, Mr. Joseph
Cooper (now also deceased). On
Mr. Mytton’s death, Mr. Cooper’s
interests in the estate were purchased
by the former gentleman’s family,
and it was at the time these affairs
were adjusted that Mr. Macmillan
became interested in “Lochinvar”
and took over its administration.
Shortly after entering upon the
control of the area he purchased
from the other members of his wife’s
family and in conjunction with Mrs.
Macmillan the remaining interests
in the “Lochinvar” portion of the


old estate; and to this has added
5,000 acres of leasehold and an
equivalent acreage of freehold, bring-
ing the dimensions of the run to a
figure in the vicinity of 100,000
acres, which are made up of free-
hold, leasehold, and occupation
licence areas. Situated in the
Lower Burdekin district, within 12
miles from Ayr, “Lochinvar” is
characterized by undulating lands
and lightly timbered plains. An
ample supply of natural water is
permanently present on the run in
the creeks which intersect it and in
lagoons—in fact, nature has so
lavishly endowed the property in this
respect that the necessity to sink
wells or bores or to resort to any of
the methods of artificial conserva-
tion has never arisen in the history
of the place. Exceptional facilities
for the transport of stock are
allowed by the situation of the area,
through which passes the railway
from Bowen to Townsville, a per-
manent siding occupying a site a few
hundred yards from the homestead.
A fine shorthorn herd, varying in
strength from 6,000 to 7,000 head,
is carried, being maintained to a
fairly uniform figure. It was
founded on the old “Airdmillan"
herd, which Mr. Macmillan pur-
chased for depasturing the “Lochin-
var” run over twenty years ago,
when entering into its occupation,
and the progeny of which fully
justifies the high opinion in which
the “Airdmillan" cattle were held
during his father’s lifetime. In the
days when the property was held by
Messrs. Cooper and Mytton, bullocks
only were run on “Lochinvar,”
but under the energetic system of
development inaugurated under the
present ownership picked breeders
were introduced to the holding,
which received, also, many improve-
ments in various other directions.
Though making the breeding of
shorthorn stock his chief interest,
Mr. Macmillan devotes considerable
study to the raising of good horse-
flesh, not only for station require-
ments, but for the local and Indian
markets; and he has succeeded in
establishing for “Lochinvar" the
reputation of raising equine stock
equal to any produced in Northern
Queensland. Breeding always from
mares of a good type, he imports
stallions of the highest quality,
those having found a home on the
area including “Serf” (imp.) by

carry out the traditions of the old
pastoral homes most perfectly, as
many a traveller, who from the
station has carried away grateful
memories, can testify. Though
naturally retiring and unassuming
in character, Mr. Macmillan, in
accordance with his conception of
patronises various of the amateur
meetings which take place in the
North, horses of his breeding having
frequently led in important events
at such gatherings. Mr. Macmillan
is a member of the North Queens-
land Club, Townsville. In the year
1901 he married Mary Elizabeth,
daughter of the late Edward Mytton,
a member of an old Worcestershire
family. Mr. Mytton came to Aus-
tralia when at the age of seventeen,


the date of his arrival in New South
Wales being recorded as 1858. Many
generations of his forbears in Wor-
cestershire had followed agrarian
life, but the possibilities of the
pastoral resources of a country then
under a century in age prompted the
advent to the land of the Southern
Cross of one who was to there
notably represent his line. He spent
some years in New South Wales,
where he gained a knowledge of

Jones. This property afterwards
passed by sale into the hands of Mr.
Nimmo, and on its disposal Mr.
Mytton acquired “Lawn Hill,” pro-
ceeding to that station in company
with the late Sir William Lyne. In
time “Lawn Hill” also was sold, the
purchaser being the late Frank
Hann, whose exploratory and
pastoral achievements are referred to
elsewhere in this work in an article

he removed to “Lochinvar,” then
recently purchased by the partners,
“Lochinvar” continued to be his
home until the time of his death,
The late gentleman was perhaps one
of the best-known and most popular
residents of the districts outlying
Ayr and Townsville, his unfailing
courtesy and uprightness winning
for him a host of friends. His
varied interests included landed
pastoral conditions and the many-
sided aspects of the industry, with
the object of later investment.
While thus engaged he became
acquainted with Mr. Joseph Cooper,
who afterwards became a partner in
his various enterprises. He came to
Queensland in the year 1864, over-
landing from the Mbther Colony

North. His first venture here was

Clarke, of "Mary Vale.” In the
year 1871 his partnership with Mr.
Cooper was established, and in con-
junction with that gentleman he
purchased “Craigie” Station. The
following year “Wando Vale” was
added to the firm’s pastoral posses-
sions, and this historical station
became Mr. Mytton’s home and the
headquarters from which he managed
his various interests. He resided
possessions in Townsville, and
a partnership in the butchering him
there known as Mytton & Co., which
a year befoie his death he sold to
Messrs. Tymons, Ta\loi & Co. He
took a prominent pait in the ahaiis

which institutions his death was a
distinct loss. He was survived by

visited the North, continuing with
him when the course of his profes-
sional work again necessitated the
surveyor’s presence in Southern
Queensland, where Mr. Burke
assisted in the survey of several areas
embraced within the boundaries of
Brisbane, as well as much of the
outlying country. After a con-
siderable period thus occupied, he
was offered by the late Colin Munro
the opportunity of joining in a small
sugar venture on “Drynie,” in the
Burdekin district, Northern Queens-
land. Mr. Burke accepted Mr.
Munro’s offer, coming North shortly
after his marriage and bringing with
him his young wife. Fie remained
for about twelve months on this prop-
erty, which, it is of interest to note,
became the site of the homestead
where he later lived for so many years
as an independentpastoral landowner.

From the early “Drynie,” which,

kanakas, he worked as a grazing and

into an engagement with the Messrs.
Young Bros., who then owned the
“Kalamia” Estate; and he continued
to be associated with this property
until in a position to open a business


in Brandon. For a number of years
he did well as one of the commercial
men of the district, but, his desnes
turning more in the direction of
landed enterprise he finally disposed
of his Brandon business and pur-
chased “Eunomia,” on Rita Island.
Here he followed the pastoral indus-
try in the face of many adversities,
chief among which were droughts
and the fatal epidemic among the
stock brought about by the early tick
visitation. He carried on, however,
in spite of all obstacles until ho
received an offer from the present
owner of “Eunomia,” Mr. W. Myt-
ton. Having disposed of the prop-
erty he acquired “Drynie,” where his
early operations as a grazier and
sugar grower were conducted; and in
course of time considerably enlarged
this property, purchasing “Ripley,”
“AVindsor Park,” “Millers,” and
other selections, thus bringing the
acreage, which is all freehold, up to
its present figure of over 7,000. The
dairying activities of the late gentle-
man, whose operations in this phase
of the pastoral industry exceeded
those of any other landholder of the
Burdekin, caused the run to become
the home of some very fine stock of
milking strains. He was the first to
introduce Friesian cattle to the Bur-
dekin watershed. Always pro-
gressive, his private interests were
never allowed to absorb his attention
to the exclusion of affairs affecting
the public weal, and, such being the
case, he was always prepared to assist
in furthering the interests of the
bodies instituted for communal pro-
gress and the advancement of the
district in which his interests were
centred. On October 24, 1921,
another gap was created in the fast
thinning ranks of our pioneers, Mr.
John Burke, after an illness of some
months, having then passed away
leaving a record of honourable ser-
vice to the community and a host of
friends to whom he had endeared
himself by the qualities of gener-
osity, straightforwardness and kind-
liness which distinguished him. For
eighteen years he was a member of
the Ayr Shire Council and for a per-
iod its chairman; and he devoted
much of his time to the affairs of the
L. P. B. A. & I. Association and the
Burdekin Delta Turf Club. His
sturdy courage and tenacity of pur-
pose were proof against the adversi-
ties which strewed his path in the
early days, and it is consoling to

think that for many years prior to
his decease he enjoyed the reward of
his laboxxrs. In July of the year
1881 he married Mary, daughter of
the late John Daly of Lower Town,
sharing with cheerful courage the
hardships and sacrifices incidental to
early settlement, and by her encour-
agement aiding her husband in his
varied enterprises. Of her sons,
the youngest son, was born at
“Eunomia” on February 17, 1903,
and educated at Mt. Carmel

WILLIAM HERBERT GREEN,
M.L.A., J.P., Mayor of Townsville,
was born in Brisbane on October 11,
1878, and is the youngest son of the
late Charles Green, an industrial
pioneer of the early sixties. An
Englishman, the late gentleman
sailed from his native land fifty-nine
years ago, and, as foreman moulder
of a foundry owned by Messrs.
Smellie & Co., settled in the country
which he was destined to claim by
adoption, and with whose progress
he was to be so closely identified
throughout a long and useful career.
After spending some time in South-
ern Queensland he transferred his
energies to the northern portion of
the present State, and in 1882, in
conjunction with Messrs. Cameron
and Mackay, established the firm of
Cameron, Mackay, & Green, and the
foundry which has been so long and
favourably known as the leading
business of its kind in Mackay.
Though devoting himself so closely
to the interests of the proprietary of
which he was a member, and, in-
cidentally, to the expansion of the
industrial resources of the State, he
found time to apply himself to the
spiritual needs of his co-religionists,
and his memory is held in honour by
many of his contemporaries and those
of a later generation who derive the
benefits of his labours, not only for
his work from a secular point of
view, but for his efforts in connec-
tion with the early organization of
the Methodist communion in Mackay,
to which his most earnest efforts con-
tinued to be directed, the present
Methodist church of this city stand-
ing as a monument to his devotion.
The late Charles Green crossed the
border to
“The undiscovered country from
whose bourn
No traveller returns”
towards the end of the last decade
of the last century. His wife, Eliza,
daughter of the late Mr. Vaughan,
passed away in the year 1915, at the
ripe old age of eighty-one. Mrs.
Green, who, like her husband, came
of old English stock, was one
of Mackay’s most public-spirited
women. She will be long remembered
for her work as a member of the
local benevolent society, at the in-
ception of which she was appointed
president, a position she retained
during the remainder of her sojourn
in Mackay. Her efforts were largely
instrumental in establishing a branch
of the Women’s Christian Temper-
ance Union in Northern Queensland,
z 2
of which body also she was chosen
as first president. Her son, Mr.
William Herbert Green, notably
proved the truth of the old adage,
“As the twig is bent, so the tree is
inclined,’’ as early training and
MR. W. H. GREEN.
environment directed the strong
personality and exceptional ability
with which he is endowed into chan-
nels that lead to worthy achieve-
ment. Educated both at the Mackay
State School and Way College,
Adelaide, on concluding his career
at the latter academy he returned to
Queensland and entered upon the
study of chemistry in Townsville as
an apprentice of the late Cromwell
Ridgley. Subsequently he studied
at the Queensland College of
Pharmacy, where, topping the list
of candidates who were his fellow
competitors, he qualified for the pro-
fession with which he was destined
to be so prominently associated as
a leading chemist of the State.
From Brisbane he returned to Towns-
ville, where, in 1901, he took over
the business of his previous employer.
It was necessary to borrow the
capital to make this start, and the
year of his establishment was the
first of those which saw Queensland
in the throes of the drought which
now looms in perspective as one of
the most disastrous events in our
history. Though having to cope with
the resultant stagnation that had so
crippling an effect on commerce of
every description, he made headway
by unwearying application, unfailing
courtesy, and the confidence of a
public to whose services he unspar-
ingly devoted himself. His prosperity
increased as the general outlook
became brighter, until finally his
foresight, enterprise, and energy
placed him in the position in which
he stands to-day as managing
director of a business bearing his
name that has extended branches to
the metropolis and to fifteen other
important centres of the State; and
as a director of Busby’s Ltd., the
Allas Assurance Co., and the Equit-
able Life Office of Queensland. To
further convey an idea of the vitality
and super-abundant energy which
are his possession, it should be said
that the multiplicity and pressure
of his private affairs has not
detracted from the duty which he
considers he owes to the public as a
citizen, among the bodies with which
he is prominently associated being
the Townsville Town Council, in
which he has held aldermanic
honours since the year 1919, when
he topped the city poll as councillor.
He was unanimously elected mayor
during the following year and re-
elected by an absolute majority in
1921 under the system of universal
franchise. The same confidence in
his integrity, ability, and business
acumen was shown by the members
of the Northern Country Party in
the choice of a candidate for the
metropolitan Townsville constituency
and by the body of electors, who
placed him in the Legislative
Assembly with a majority of over
500 votes, a victory which emphasises
his popularity in that the Towns-
ville electorate has been long re-
garded as the stronghold of Labour.
He contested the Townsville seat
with the Labour candidate, who, in
the year 1915, supplanted the late
Sir Robert Philp, whose good work
for Northern Queensland, and
especially for Townsville, has now
become history, and whose mantle
could not have fallen on the
shoulders of a worthier successor
than the present member for the dis-
trict with which the late statesman
so closely identified himself, Mr.
Green being an indefatigable worker
and already a force in politics.
Until its amalgamation with the
Queensland Country Party, Mr.
Green was the leader of the body
which represented similar interests
in the North, and in Brisbane was
one of the committee which, com-
prised by representatives of the
National and Queensland Country


Parties, adjusted certain seats which
were previously a cause of dispute
that threatened to weaken the
Opposition, to whose ranks both
parties belong. In Townsville he
continues to render valued service as
chairman of the Boards of the Fire
Brigade, the Soldiers’ Memorial
Fund, the Cemetery Trustees, the
Townsville West State School —
which is the second largest State
scholastic institution in Queensland
—and several other bodies. Keenly
patriotic, he is president of the Royal
Society of St. George, and his
affection for the arts is evidenced in
his occupancy of the presidentship of
the Northern Queensland Eisteddfod
executive. Many equally deserving
bodies claim his patronage as pre-
sident or vice-president. He is a Past
Grand of the M.U.1.0.0.F., and
a prominent member of the Masonic
brotherhood, being the first District
Grand Master of the first District
Grand Lodge under the United
Grand Lodge of Queensland. A
pillar of the Methodist Church, he
is a well-known local preacher and
a superintendent of one of the
largest Sunday schools in Queens-
land. Promoters of clean sport can
always count upon his pationage.
In earlier years he w T as an enthusi-
astic cricketer, a form of recreation
which gave place to bowls as public
duties claimed more and more of his
leisure. In the year 1903 he mai-
ried Clara, daughter of Mr. George
Cockerill, who is one of the oldest
identities of Northern Queensland.
Mr. Cockerill came from Birming-
ham, England, and has resided in
Townsville for over forty years.
Mrs. Green has identified herself
with those communal activities
which are peculiarly a woman’s pro-
vince, and presides over different
bodies instituted in the causes of
patriotism, charity, and other
worthy objectives. Her family con-
sists of two sons and three daughters.
Of the sons, the elder, Charles
Stanley, born in the year 1904,
was educated at Wesley College,
Melbourne, and at time of writing
is studying chemistry under his
father’s supervision in Townsville.
William Herbert, the second son,
was born in the year 1912 in Towns-
ville, where his education is being
now conducted. The two elder
daughters are students at the
Methodist Ladies’ College, Mel-
bourne.
JOHN McKINLEY, Armstrong
Street, Hermit Park, Townsville,
was born at Clare, near Adelaide,
South Australia, in May, 1854. A
pioneer and a son of a pioneer, his
memories of Queensland date back
to the early sixties, the time of the
arrival in the then Colony of his
father, the late Robert McKinley, a
Scotchman who made his advent to
New South Wales in 1840 and
thenceforward followed the profes-
sion of wool classer. The late Robert
McKinley was associated with many
historical old stations of several
colonies, those which knew him best
being “Bungaree,” “Bundaleer,”
“Murkpa,” “Anlaby,” “Booboo-
rowie,” “Warcowie,” and “Can-
owie,” in South Australia ; “Mona
Yale,” in Tasmania; and “Jon-
daryan,” “Jimbour,” “Tara,”
“Bluff Downs,” “Craigie,” and
“Bowen Downs,” in Queensland.
After many years of pioneering work
in his adopted country, he died in
Sydney at the ripe old age of eighty-
six. His son, Mr. John McKinley,
of Townsville, spent four years of his
early boyhood at Goolwa, a town-
ship near the Murray mouth, and
attended there for a few months a
small private school. In 1862 he
accompanied his family to “Jon-
daryan” Station, on the Darling
Downs, and continued his educa-
tion until slightly past his ninth
year, when his work in the industry
to which he has devoted his whole
life began. Most of his experiences
have been gained in the back
country, and his association with the
Burdekin watershed dates from the
early sixties, shortly after the dis-
covery of the river and the opening
up of the country northwards for
settlement. Portion of his boyhood
was spent at “Lyndhurst” Sta-
tion, where he was residing when
Mr. Fulford, sen., came there in
1870. At the age of eighteen he
formed, in conjunction with his
brother, “Pandanus Creek” Sta-
tion, which is now the property of
Bergyl & Co. During the two or
three years that “Pandanus Creek”
was in the early stages of develop-
ment, the Messrs. McKinley en-
gaged in carrying with bullock teams
in the district of which Charters
Towers is now the chief centre, and
in the face of many hardships and
privations incidental to this calling
in those far-away times, contributed
to the work of settlement then
recently inaugurated in the locality.
“Pandanus Creek” was held by the
brothers for about thirty years,
being sold by them about the year
1902 to Mr. William McDowall, of
“Greenvale” Station. Mr. McKinley
has a fund of reminiscences, and his
recollections of Northern Queens-
land in the early days would make
an interesting volume.
RICHARD FRASER CLARKE,
“Toora,” Jarvisfield, Ayr, was born
at Maryborough, Queensland, and is
the eldest son of the late Richard
Fraser Clarke, who, hailing from
the North of Ireland, settled in Vic-
toria about the middle of the last
century and engaged for some con-
siderable time in mining there, being
among those who pioneered the gold
industry in this Continent. In his
case, however, as in that of so many
others, mining did not prove remun-
erative, so, learning of the landed
possibilities of Queensland, he
decided to make a fresh start in a
more stable industry than that which
he had hitherto so perseveringly
followed. The year 1864 witnessed
his arrival in the then infant Colony
of the North, and his selection of a
block of farming country on the
Mary River. He originally demoted
this land to maize-growing, but very
shortly after the possibilities of
sugar-growing were first fully dem-
onstrated in Queensland by a Mr.
John Buhot (1862), and by the Hon.
Louis Hope (1863), he put his area
under cane, thus earning for himself
the right to be recorded amongst the
pioneers of the industry which has
since taken such deep root in the
State. For several years his crops,
as they matured, were sold to the
mill owners of the Maryborough
district, but, about the year 1880,
he commenced crushing on his own
property—purchasing a small plant
for the purpose—and thereafter con-
veyed the juice by punt to Yengaxhe,
where it was sold to the owners of
the refinery there, the Messrs. Cran
Bros., members of a family well-
known in its prominent association
with the foundation of the sugar in-
dustry in the State. He continued
to operate on these lines until 1893,
when he became a victim of the dis-
astrous flood that ruined nearly
every planter on the Mary during
that year. Being thus bereft of the
results of many arduous years, Mr.


Clarke was faced with the necessity
of making a fresh start, and this,
with a pluck and determination that
stands as an example for future
generations, he effected in the Isis
district, where he carried on as a
sugar planter until the time of his
death, when the country lost a settler
of the finest type and one who played
no small part in the agricultural
development of the land of his adop-
tion. His eldest son, Mr. Clarke of
“Toora,” benefited by a school at
Owanyilla, and subsequently, when
the exigencies of his father’s calling
demanded that he should take his
part in the outdoor work of the
farm, lost no opportunity of aug-
menting the knowledge gained dur-
ing schooldays. He struck out for
himself in 1893, shortly after the
family’s removal to the Isis property,
and took up farming land in the
vicinity of Childers in conjunction
with Mr. Percy Turner and Mr.
Fred Penny, with whom he was
associated in the same venture for
about eleven years, the partnership
being dissolved when the lease of the
block expired. He then purchased
the farm on his own account and
continued to devote its acres to cane
for the following seven years, dis-
posing of it in 1911 in order to carry
on the industry on the Lower Burde-
kin River. As the outcome of
an inspection of country in the
North, he purchased a 300 acre block
situated eight miles from Ayr on a
bank of the Ana Branch, and has
since continued to devote his long
experience of the industry to the
development and improvement of this
property, which is named “Toora”
from the aboriginal word meaning
“good land.” During his long asso-
ciation with the district outlying
Ayr, Mr. Clarke has consistently
played the part of a progressive
citizen, and in this respect, as in the
various “ups and downs” that invar-
iably fall to the lot of the man on the
land, his every effort has been loyally
seconded by his wife, to whose un-
swerving support he attributes such
success as has fallen to his share.
He is a member of the Ayr Shire
Council, the Burdekin Pastoral and
Agricultural Association and the
Lower Burdekin Farmers’ Associa-
tion. He married Agnes, daughter
of the late Thomas M. O’Leary, who
was one of Queensland’s early
settlers on the Logan River. Of the
union there are two sons, Percival
Fraser and Thomas William, born
at Childers, and primarily educated
there, completing a secondary
course at the Townsville Grammar
School. The Messrs. Clarke, Jun.,
have ably assisted their father in
the work and administration of
“Toora” for several years past, and
combine with physical energy a keen
study of the industry from a scien-
tific standpoint. Both are enthus-
iasts at tennis, cricket and football,
and are keen yachtsmen.

tions, Northern Queensland. In a
chronicle of the pioneers of the
North the career of the founder of
MR. C. O. GARBUTT.
the Garbutt family should certainly
be recorded, for, though unre-
warded with the success that
crowned the enterprise of a com-
paratively few of those who faced
the terrible hardships incidental to
pastoral undertakings in the early
days, he none the less nobly played
his part as a nation builder in lay-
ing the foundations of industry in
a vast, sparsely settled, and little
known territory. He arrived in Aus-
tralia in the year 1864 as a lad of
sixteen, having accompanied his
widowed mother and two brothers
from “Marton Hall,” near Middles-
brough-on-Tees, Yorkshire, a fine
old seat which had long been held
by the family ere passing to other
hands during the last century. Old
records such as are to be found
carved in ancient churches, or pre-
served in documents dating far back
in the realms of history, bear testi-
mony to the place and standing of
the Yorkshire progenitors of the
Garbutt family. The first renre-
sentatives of the line in Australia —
the mother and her three sons —-
brought into the country a capital of
about £50,000, which they invested
in cattle and in large areas of land on
the Lower Logan,• carrying on con-
jointly in the pastoral industry until
death claimed two of the brothers,
leaving Mr. C. O. Garbutt to per-
petuate the name under the
Southern Cross. The early pastoral
investments with which he was
associated had not turned out very
favourably owing to a variety of
circumstances, so, in the year 1878,
he sold those remaining to him and
proceeded to Port Douglas, and
thence inland to the watershed of
the Upper Herbert, where he pur-
chased “Woodleigh” Station and
took up adjoining country which he
founded as a cattle holding and
named “Tirrabella.” Tire journey
from Port Douglas was accomplished
by the late gentleman, his wife, and
the four young children on horse-
back, the youngest, a baby in arms,
being carried by its mother, who
thus assisted in droving the first mob
of cattle destined for the pastures
surrounding her new home. Though
devoting all his energies to the
development of his holdings, which
he formed with a nucleus of stock
from “Lolworth” and “Salisbury
Plains” Stations, securing bulls
from the famous “Cressbrook” and
“Durundar” studs, his enterprise
was continually hampered by lack of
markets, droughts, financial depres-
sion, and other causes, and finally
he was deprived of the results of
many years of arduous toil by the
scourge of ticks that, towards the
end of the last century, decimated
by the fatal fever which they con-
veyed the greater number of the
herds of Queensland. He had been
identified with the pastoral develop-
ment of the Herberton district for
more than twenty years ere hard
work and severe mental strain
seriously affected his health, and
finally hastened his death, which
occurred in Herberton in the year
1906. His widow and eight children


survived him. Mrs. Garbutt was
Lucy Elizabeth, daughter of the late
John Watson, of Stam-
ford Hill, near London, who was a
well-known English civil engineer
MR. C. C. A. GARBUTT.
and contractor of his day, and super-
vised the work of railway construc-
tion in several continents shortly
after the invention of steam loco-
motives. Her mother was Elizabeth,
daughter of James Overend, a
noted Quaker and a descendant of a
family which was connected with the
early manufacture of linen in Eng-
land. Her first meeting with her
then future husband was in the
year 1868, when the pioneer visited
his old home, and her marriage
occurred three years later, Mr.
Garbutt having voyaged to England
for the ceremony. Too' much cannot
be said in admiration of this gently-
nurtured and cultured woman, and
of the many others, who, like her,
adapting themselves to the rough
conditions of a civilization yet in the
making, gave to Australia a race
which vies in physical, mental, and
moral fitness with any in the world.
Her union with the late C. O. Gar-
butt resulted in a family of thirteen,
of which four sons and four daugh-
ters survive. The daughters are all
married, the eldest, Lucy Maud, to
Mr. Walter Jordan, a Western
Queensland pastoralist and a mem-
ber of an old Clarence River family
of New South Wales; the second,
Kate Winifred, to Mr. Frank
Alston, of “Stoneleigh” Station, in
the Ingham district; the third,
Mary Geraldine, to Mr. Norman
Mills, of Dalgety & Co. Ltd., Towns-
ville; and the youngest, Dorothy
Evelyn, to Mr. Harvey Tice, of the
Townsville firm of Rees & Tice. Of
the sons, the two elder and the
youngest constitute the firm of
Garbutt Bros., of Townsville, the
third being engaged in sugar pro-
duction as a farm holder in the dis-
trict outlying Innisfail. CHARLES
CECIL ARTHUR GARBUTT, the
eldest son of the late Charles O.
Garbutt, was born in March of the
year 1877, and educated at the
Brisbane Grammar School. On the
conclusion of his student days he
returned to his family and devoted
himself to pastoral pursuits under
his father, on whose properties,
MR. J. O. GARBUTT.
and subsequently on other stations
in the North-west, he obtained a
thorough grounding in the industry.
The disasters which, in earlier
years, so frequently attended pas-
toral enterprise, caused him to
relinquish the calling to which he
had been trained and seek other
fields for his energies. For a period
he was identified with the progress
of Mareeba as the proprietor of an
auctioneering business, and for a
time he was “mine host” of the
chief hostelry of Mount Molloy.
Shortly after his brother Ernest
started operations as a butcher in
Townsville he joined him in the
venture, with which he has since
been associated as part owner and
buyer. He also directs operations
on the station properties “Uran-
nah” and “Mount Marion,” which
the firm purchased in the year 1916.
He is a keen judge of all class of
stock, and his knowledge in this con-
nection has been availed of by
various industrial associations of the
coastal and western districts, for
which he has acted as judge or
steward on numerous occasions; and
by several racing bodies, including
the Townsville Turf Club, for which
he has fulfilled the functions of
judge for the past ten years. He
married Annie, daughter of the
late J. P. Hides, who came to
Northern Queensland when settle-
ment was young in the State, con-
tinuing to be identified with the
growth of Herberton from the
town’s infant days. He left several
sons, who have made good in
different fields of activity. Mr. C.
C. Arthur Garbutt has a surviving
family of two sons and three daugh-
ters. JOHN OVEREND GAR-
BUTT was born at Cryna, on the
Logan, Southern Queensland, on
October 21, 1879, and educated at
Nash’s Private School, near Her-
berton, and also under private
tuition at home. As soon as he was
of an age to do a man’s part on
“Woodleigh” and “Tirrabella” he
discontinued his studies and did
what was possible to mitigate the

disaster which followed the suc-
cession of adversities that marked
the declining years of the pioneer.
I inally starting out on his own
account, he established himself as a


butcher at Mount Garnet, where he
was engaged in stock dealing and
other phases of his trade for ten
years, at the end of which he also
joined his brother Ernest at Towns-
ville. Here he has since resided and
supervised the retail operations of
the firm of Garbutt Bros. Like his
partner, he advocates clean sport of
every description, lending his sup-
port chiefly to horse racing. He
married Margaret Mary, daughter
of the late Hugh McAulay, a
Scotchman of Celtic origin, who
married a lady of Irish birth. Mr.
John Garbutt has a family of four
eons and three daughters. ERNEST
TEMPLE GARBUTT, the youngest
son of the pioneer and the founder
of the firm of Garbutt Bros., was
born at “Tirrabella” on May 18,
1884. To his mother’s tuition he
owes the knowledge secured by most
children at school, and his experi-
ence of stock work began when he
was old enough to ride. When he
was fourteen he started on the roads
with a pioneer drover named Mr.
John Kerr, with a mob of cattle for
“Highbury” and “Dunbar” Sta-
tions, in the Mitchell district. The
cattle were so poor owing to the
drought conditions that they were
sold by the owners, the Queensland
Bank, Ltd., for 2s. 6d. per head,
and intended for the boiling-down
works at Cardwell. After a year on
the roads, Mr. Ernest T. Garbutt
returned to “Tirrabella,” where he

remained until reaching the age of
sixteen, when, continued drought
conditions causing industrial stag-
nation at home, he decided to
strike out for himself. His first
venture was as a butcher at Cool-
garra, a township near Mount Gar-
net, where his efforts yielded him
the best part of LI,OOO in the course
of a year. While he was at Cool-
garra the home property, “Tirra-
bella,” was sold, and a combined
butchery and fruit farm at Kuranda
purchased by his mother. The farm
carried 5,000 trees, and in the
working of both departments of the
venture she was assisted by her third
son, Herbert, and later joined by
Mr. Ernest Garbutt, who, selling
his Coolgarra business, used up his
capital in the attempt to make this
proposition a profitable one. How-
ever, even his business acumen and
industry failed to accomplish his
purpose, and he was faced with the
necessity of again making a start
with no other assets than intelli-
gence, integrity, and a capacity for
hard work. From Kuranda he went
to Mount Garnet, where he became
employed in the butchery then run
by Mr. John Garbutt, with whom
he remained until he had acquired
sufficient capital to make another
start on his own account. His
opportunity occurred with the open-
ing up of the tin mines at Gurrum-
bah, where, purchasing an old yard
from Mr. Dalziel (the discoverer of

th© mines), and building a tern-
porary bough shed, he supplied meat
to the miners, being enabled to
carry on by the courtesy of Mr.
John Perrott, the owner of
“Evelyn” Station, near Herberton,
who considered the good name of the
Garbutt family sufficient guarantee
for the credit the young man needed
to tide him over the first few months
of his undertaking. He spent about
a year butchering in Gurrumbah,
and in the period cleared £I,OOO.
With this amount as his whole
capital he came to Townsville,
where, on August 1, 1907, he pur-
chased from the Townsville Butcher-
ing Co. their business situated near
the corner of Stanley and Flinders
Streets, and, exactly a month later,
began his active career as a commer-
cial citizen of the town. Thus, from

he lends his support being the

is a steward and committeeman.
He married in the year 1912 Agnes
Margaret, daughter of the late
James Harvey, who was one of the
pioneering group who laid the
foundations of commerce in the
North, and who will be remembered
by many of our leaders as a founder
of the well-known Townsville firm
of Rooney & Co. Mr. E. T. Gar-
butt has a surviving family of one
son and three daughters. HER-
BERT RADCLIFFE GARBUTT,
the third son of the founder of the
Garbutt family in Australia, first
saw the light at “Woodleigh” Sta-
tion, near Herberton. He and his
brother Ernest were similarly edu-
cated. When “Tirrabella” was sold
the enterprise of a young man of
twenty-three, sprang what is now
the largest retail butchery in the
city of Townsville. After a brief
period he was joined by his brothers
as already stated, and the firm of
Garbutt Bros, was formed, which,
with Mr. Ernest Garbutt as finan-
cial manager, prospered to the ex-
tent of permitting the purchase of
the freehold on which the establish-
ment stands, and the extension of
its interests in other directions.
Later it was floated into a limited
liability company. The partners now
conduct a large shipping and agency
business and two station properties,
and are well known as stock buyers

of the State. Their premises con-

by his support of those bodies in-
stituted in the interests of the
community of which he is a member
and the advancement of the North
generally, his interest in the welfare
of the State being marked by his
occupancy of the presidentship of
the Northern Division of the Queens-
land Country Party, erstwhile
titled the Northern Country Party.
He is a committeeman of the Towns-

growing at Kuranda on his mother’s
behalf. Subsequently he conducted
a butchering business for the late

and later went in for sugar-growing.
Soon after the outbreak of the
Great War he volunteered and
became a member of the Machine
Gun Section of the A.T.F., with
which he participated in the fighting
on the Italian border and in
parts of France. He was also
attached to a Tank Section for a
period, and continued in the firing
line until he became a casualty from
gas. After about three years’ ser-
vice in the army he returned to
Australia and received his discharge,
and since has engaged in sugar pro-
duction at his property near

HENRY ABBOTT, J.P., “Kar-
ilpa,” Princess Street, Hyde Park,
Townsville, was born on the Williams
River, near Dungog, New South
Wales, on September 8, 1845, and is
the youngest of the three sons born
to the late John Neville Abbott,
who, hailing from King’s County,
Ireland, founded in Australia a
branch of one of the oldest families
of his native land. On the maternal
side he is descended from the Nev-
illes, who are allied with many of the
most ancient families of the Irish
aristocracy. Sir Joseph Abbott, an
early speaker of the New South
Wales Legislative Assembly, was a
member of the branch of the Abbott
family which John Neville Abbott
established under the Southern
Cross. The last-named gentleman
invested the capital which he brought
from the Old World in farming land
on Wallace Creek, Maitland, New
South Wales, and spent many years
in the Hunter River district fight-
ing the adverse conditions incidental
to agricultural enterprise in earlier
times, finally being advised of the
better outlook which Queensland
offered the farming landowner,
in Mackay in the early nineties, he
followed agrarian avocations in the
outlying district. A family of two

sons and three daughters survived
him. The sons, the subject of our
memoir, and Mr. J. T. Abbott,
played well their part in the early
in Dungog and by private tuition at
“Wallarobba,” one of the properties
owned by his father in New South
Wales. He concluded his studies at
the age of fifteen, and when a year
older paid his first visit to Queens-
land in company with his brother,
John Thomas, who, having pre-
viously visited the North, had
returned to New South Wales in
1860 as a drover, and in 1862,
accompanied by Mr. Henry
Abbott, set out from Dungog
for the Moonie to take charge of
1,200 cattle for “Grantham,” which
at that date was in the possession of
Messrs. Gilchrist, Watt & Co.
“Grantham” had been previously
run solely as a sheep proposition, the
cattle delivered by the Messrs.
Abbott in the early sixties being
depastured as a trial venture. After
the stock were handed over, Mr.
Henry Abbott, though then only
seventeen years of age, was asked to
take charge of the herd. This he
agreed to do, and, entering immedi-
ately upon his duties, continued to be
identified with the property in var-
ious responsible capacities for the
following ten years. On finally

The former, Mr. Henry Abbott, of
“Karilpa,” was educated at a school
leaving “Grantham” in 1872, he
accepted the offer of a post from
Messrs. Carpandale, Vanneck <fe Co.


as drover in charge of 2,000 breeders
for “Fanning River” Station in the
Burdekin district. In this mob and
in the pastures for which they were
intended he had an interest, and,
after the safe delivery of the stock,'
he personally took charge of the sta-
tion and for long carried out the
duties incidental to its administra-
tion. “Fanning River” was origin-
ally taken up by the late Robert
Towns (after whom Townsville is
named) and his partners. It passed
from them to the Oriental Bank and
was later abandoned, remaining un-
developed until, in the seventies, it
the late nineties, some of the cattle
camps on the property were depleted
at the rate of 75 per cent, by cattle
ticks. However, he was able to over-
come the effects of the most disas-
trous visitations, and, throughout
his lengthy career, devoted himself
whole-heartedly to the advancement
of the industry in Northern Queens-
land. About seven years before he
sold the “Fanning River” Station he
bought out his partners. In looking
back upon an eventful past, he
realizes how much he was helped by
the unfailing loyalty and the un-
wearying support of his good wife
sworn in in the same capacity
on the accession to the throne of
Edward VII. and George V. He
has always taken an active part in
public affairs, and in this connection,
as web as in his private life, has a
most honourable record. For several
years he was a member of the Dal-
rymple Shire Council, and, for a
period, of the Council of the Thur-
ingowa Shire, of which he was chair-
man for two years. He was president
of the Townsville Pastoral, Agricul-
tural and Industrial Society for
eleven years, and during the past
forty years has continued to place his

was selected by the subject of our
memoir and the gentleman with
whom he was associated. During his
pastoral career, Mr. Abbott experi-
enced many vicissitudes and suffered
severe hardships and privations,
showing an undaunted front to
droughts, stock epidemics and the
many scourges that hampered the
pioneers in their efforts to make good
in the days when experience was
most dearly bought for the later
comers As an example of the ter-
rible setbacks that he experienced in
common with many other pastoral-
ists, it should be mentioned that, in
(who is also his second cousin), who
regarded no sacrifice too great that
was demanded by circumstances for
the continuation of a comradeship
which her qualities of wifehood so
firmly cemented. Mrs. Abbott, to
Avhom his marriage occurred in the
year 1888, was Frances Mary,
daughter of the late Robert Neville,
King’s County, Ireland, and Eliza-
beth Smyth, daughter of Captain
Edward Hackett, 3rd Royal Vic-
toria Battalion. In the reign of
Queen Victoria, Mr. Henry Abbott
first received his commission as Jus-
tice of the Peace, being consecutively

vice of the public as cattle judge at
the annual exhibitions of that Asso-
ciation and of similar bodies of other
important Northern Queensland
centres. In matters of charity or
patriotism he has also done his part,
and, as a stanch adherent of the
Church of England, loyally assisted
in furthering the interests of that
communion. Some twenty years
ago he retired from active association
with pastoral pursuits, and took up
his residence at Hyde Park, Towns-

headquarters.

brothers, Messrs. Robert James and
Thomas Joseph Atkinson, are pro-
minently representative. As pastoral-
ists they have followed closely in the
footsteps of the original pioneers and
proved most worthy descendants of
their pioneer father, the late James
Atkinson. Descended from old Scot-
tish stock, a branch of which many
generations ago settled in the North
of Ireland, the late gentleman,
before setting out for Australia,
spent most of his life in Belfast,
where his father was connected with
the linen trade, which forms so im-
portant a phase of industry in that
city. When in his middle twenties,
having become aware of the poten-
tialities of Australia, he decided that
the prospects which the newer land
offered to those who were able and
willing to face hardship, sacrifice,
and toil, were sufficiently attractive

to warrant the relinquishment of the
ease and comfort of an older civi-
lization—a conclusion which was
largely fostered, doubtless, by that
spirit of enterprise which has
prompted the actions of the men who
have made history in every age and
clime. He arrived in Victoria in the
early fifties, at a time when the
sensational gold discoveries of the
period were attracting men from
every portion of the known world,
and of every class, profession, and
trade which then offered a means of
livelihood, by the prospect of speedy
wealth as a reward for a short period
of labour with pick and shovel. Very
few of those who thus faced the hard
life and fare of the times received
the expected reward, but many
earned fair incomes and assisted in
forming the prosperous towns which
rapidly sprang up on the sites of the

impossibility of expansion, and
seek new fields for his energies. His
conviction as to the limitless possi-
bilities of the vast spaces then await-
ing development in the North, and
his initiative, enterprise, and capac-
ity for work led to the formation of
a partnership between him and one
Ezra Firth and to preparations for
a pastoral venture in the then little
known territory comprising Northern
Queensland, where, in due course,
the time being the early sixties, the
Atkinson family and Mr. Firth
arrived. They travelled from Vic-
toria to the mouth of the Burdekin
River by schooner, from that point
journeying by vehicle to a spot which
later became known as Firth’s
Lagoon, from a waterway near which
the party camped for a brief period
ere moving on to country offering
greater attractions to Mr. Atkinson,
and which the partners took up for
pastoral development. At Firth’s
Lagoon, within a few miles of his
station homestead, fate having
destined that he should one day
become the owner of the wide acres
of which his birthplace forms a part,
Mr. H. J. Atkinson was born. The

Mr. James Atkinson sold to the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. a con-
siderable portion of his freehold land
in the Ingham district and removed
the stock to “Wairuna,” a property
on the Upper Burdekin, which he
had purchased for the purpose. On
“Wairuna” the remainder of his life
was spent, the year 1899 witnessing
its closure. His demise was a dis-
tinct loss to the country, the
development of which his labours had
so largely aided, and to the many
friends who had the privilege of
knowing him intimately as a good
neighbour, an estimable citizen, and
a friend whose integrity was unim-
peachable. He married in the late
fifties Miss Kate Good, a native of
Ireland, whose progenitors were of
English stock, having settled in
County Cork shortly after the
Reformation, when the Cromwellian
Government offered considerable in-
ducement to encourage English
settlement across the water. The
Good family were agriculturistsinlre-
land, having been identified with pri-
mary production in County Cork for
several generations. Mrs. Atkinson
came to Australia to join a brother
who was settled in Victoria. Though
used to all the refinements and
luxuries of an advanced civilization
and possessed of the advantages
of a high standard of educa-
tion, she cheerfully faced the strange
and rough conditions which were the
accompaniments of her new life, prov-
ing herself resourceful, courageous,
and enduring, and possessed
of those qualities of wifehood and
motherhood which we love to con-
template with pride as the factors
which have built up a sturdy race
that compares favourably with the
manhood of the world—a race which
proved its metal on the battle-fields
of the East and West during the last
Great War in a manner that will live
in history. Among the trials which
she was called upon to face during
her early married life in Victoria
was almost complete destitution as
the result of the devastating bush
fire on February 6, 1851, recorded in
Australian annals as Black Thurs-
day. On this day the whole country
appeared ablaze, and from a fire at
Macedon, forty-six miles away, the
ashes descended in Melbourne.
Settlers were forced to leave their
flocks and herds and were thankful
to escape the dreadful death which
overtook those less fortunate. The
home of the Atkinson family was
reduced to ashes, and Mrs. Atkinson
and her infant daughter took refuge
in a creek, where they remained
almost wholly immersed until the
fire had passed over them. With that
indomitable spirit that calls for a
tribute which words are inadequate
to supply, the courageous couple
started afresh on the ruins of their
previous efforts, shortly afterwards
setting out for Queensland, where the
fruits of their life and work live after
them to prove an incentive to those
of this and future generations who
may read of the men and women by
whom the foundations of the nation
were built. Mr. Atkinson was sur-
vived by a family of three sons and
one daughter, the sons being all well-
known Northern Queensland pastor-
alists, Robert James having his home
on “Cashmere” Station, on the
Herbert River, and Thomas Joseph
being resident at “Gunnawarra,” a
holding in the vicinity of Mount
Garnet. For some considerable time
before his death he lived in partial
retirement, having handed his estate
over to his three, sons, to be held in
partnership by them. Mr. Henry
John Atkinson, his eldest son, was
born, as already stated, at Firth’s
Lagoon, a few miles from his present
homestead, on July 12, 1864. He
was primarily educated under the
paternal rooftree by his mother, and
subsequently at a school in Towns-
ville. Of course his experience of
stock began at a very early age, it
being with him, as with most station-
bred lads, but a step from the cradle
to the saddle. When he was in his
middle teens he was his father’s right
hand, doing a man’s work, and even
taking his place on the roads when
cattle had to be travelled to market.
When still a youth, he took charge
of a mob of bullocks which were
being despatched to Geraldton (now
Innisfail), this town being then
newly founded, and Mr. Atkinson
had charge of the first bullocks
brought there, having been pur-
chased by the original Geraldton
butcher for the local supply. He
continued to assist his father’s opera-
tions throughout his youth and man-
hood, and to extend their scope in
partnership with his brothers until
the year 1914, when he retired from
the firm of which he had been so long

by their father. With the “Greenvale’
block, Mr. H. J. Atkinson retained
“Wairuna” and “Mount Lang” as
his share of the previously united
interests, but subsequently sold the
Ingham, and elsewhere. “Green-
vale” is chiefly devoted to cattle,
though a fair number of horses are
also carried, approximately 450.
The equine stock are bred both for
shorthorns which comprise the
“Greenvale” herd, the strength of
which is estimated at 15,000 head,
He is a thorough believer in the im-
portance of breeding from good


strains, and the high standard of
excellence noticeable in the herd is
undoubtedly due to the care he has
always used in the selection of bulls,
these being periodically introduced
from the best Southern studs. An
interesting phase of the operations
which he directs, and one in which he
has been most successful, is the
breeding of mules, his original
donkey stock having come from the
Motherland. As a further example
of his enterprise, it should be men-
tioned that he is now demonstrating
the possibility of improving the
existing types of beef cattle in the
North by mating Zebu bulls with
shorthorn stock, his object being the
production of a hardier type than
that now common to the locality,
and one that will be practically tick
resistant and capable of withstand-
ing the drought conditions to which
O O
the popular strains succumb. In
handling this project, he is careful in
his choice of cattle, and experiments
only in the coastal country, where
the tick pest is rife. The area com-
prised within the boundaries of
“Greenvale” covers a mileage in the
region of 500, though, at one time,
its dimensions reached as high a
figure as 900 square miles, the reduc-
tion being due to the policy of
resumption adopted by various
Governments with the object of en-
couraging closer settlement. Highly
suitable for cattle, the country is
characterised by open forest lands
predominating in acreage over occa-
sional black soil plains. The whole
run is well clothed with many varie-
ties of native grasses, of which much
in evidence is the hardy spinifex,
which, with the several species of
edible shrubs carried, stand well to
the stock in dry times and render the
run very safe for the pasturage of
horned stock. From a water point of
view, the run is well insured against
the advent of ordinary dry seasons,
the Eurdekin River, which in this
locality provides good and lasting
supplies, and a permanent spring
supplying Grey’s Creek, which
intersects the run, being supple-
mented in the paddocks away from
these streams by large dams, from
which the water is conveyed to the
stock by the action of windmills or
other machinery. These dams are
twelve in number. Situated within
a few hundred yards from the
Eurdekin watercourse, the homestead

comprises a group of buildings, each
of which, having been erected at a
different period, represents a stage in
the march of settlement, the more
modern erections affording a sharp
contrast to those of slabs or iron
which served in earlier days. Many
modern improvements add to the
convenience and comfort of the inner
arrangements of this most typical
home of an old estate, and that in-
definable charm which is ever left by
the hand of time is enhanced by
separate gardens wherein bright
patches of colour contrast with the
duller hue of a well-kept tennis court
and the greenery of smaller lawns.
The nearness of the river has made
possible the cultivation of a very fine
garden, where, at a short distance
from the dwelling, is grown every-
thing needful in the way of fresh
vegetable food. Included among the
large, airy, well-furnished apart-
ments of the home is a large and
excellently appointed billiard-room.
Many reading of this old homestead
will associate it with the hospitality
in which its host and hostess so pre-
eminently excel, and with the homely
comfort that, at the end of a long
and weary day, has made the dis-
comforts of a journey over difficult
roads sink into insignificance. Some
of the few remaining aborigines of
the State are camped around the dis-
trict in which “Greenvale” lies, and
the station is (and has been for many
years) the home of quite a number of
these dusky children of the soil, who
show by their contentment and use-
fulness what kindly treatment may
effect even among a race so often
described as amongst the lowest in
the human family. Mr. Atkinson
was created a Justice of the Peace
under the Philp Administration. Uis
name figures prominently in connec-
tion with the many movements tend-
ing to progress, the mining and
other industries that make for the
prosperity of the State receiving his
strong support. Always a keen
student of nature, his knowledge of
bush lore is such as to make the sur-
roundings of his home a never-
failing source of interest. Tie is a
keen racing man, and has had con-
siderable success on the turf, his
enterprise in this direction extending

Frances, daughter of Mr. Herbert
Mackay, the union producing three
sons and a daughter. Mr. Mackay
will be remembered by many Queens-
landers in his capacity of Northern
District Surveyor of the State. He
now lives with his son in Proserpine,
having retired from the Civil Service

daughter died in the year 1919. Of
the sons the eldest, James Herbert
Atkinson, was born on May 9, 1900,
at the time of his father’s residence
at “Wairuna.” He was educated at
the Grammar Schools of Toowoomba
and Townsville, and on the conclu-
sion of his studies returned to
“Greenvale,” where he has since
been engaged in pastoral work. For.
some time past he has carried out
the management of the run under
the advice of Mr. H. J. Atkinson.
Henry Delwyn Atkinson, the next
in age, was born on December 10,
1904, and is a past student of the
Townsville Grammar School and
King’s School, Parramatta. Ho

FRANK EDWARD BUNDOCK,
“Glendon” Station, Charters Towers,
Northern Queensland, was born at
“Peegurrima,” an outstation of
“Natal Downs,” on April 9, 1891.
MR. F. F. BUNDOCK.
He is the second son of the late
Francis Forbes Bundock, and a
grandson of * the late Wellington
Cochrane Bundock, who, hailing
from Devonshire, England, settled
in Australia in the late twenties, his
father having been an officer of the
Royal Navy during the latter part
of the 18th century. From the time
of its foundation here the family has
continued to be identified with the
pastoral development of the Contin-
ent, Mr. Wellington C. Bundock
having been well known during his
lifetime as the owner of “Wyan-
garie” Station on the Richmond
River. The late Francis Forbes
Bundock was born at "Wyangarie
on February 11, 1856, and his death
occurred in Sydney in the year 1910.
Like his father and other members
of his family he was a well-known
pastoralist of New South Wales.
He was maternally descended from
William Ogilvie, who, as an officer
in the Royal Navy, fought under
Nelson at Trafalgar and Copenhagen,
and subsequently was given a grant
of Crown land on the Hunter River,
New South Wales. The Ogilvie
family is still represented in the pas-
toral world of the Mother State.
From King’s School, Parramatta,
where he studied for some years,
Mr. F. F. Bundock entered the
University of Sydney, there gaining
his B.A. degree. On the termination
of his university career he returned to
“Wyangarie,” where, for a time, he
was engaged in assisting in his
father’s pastoral operations. The year
1879 witnessed his advent to Northern
Queensland for the purpose of taking
over the management “Peegurrima,”
a cattle station which had been
previously taken up in conjunction
with his brothers. Four years
later, in 1883, he acquired, in the
interests of the firm of which he was
a member, ‘‘Natal Downs,” a sheep
property, and placed the run in
charge of a manager. In time, the fact
becoming evident that the country
hereabouts is unsuitable for sheep,
the woolly stock on “Natal Downs”
were sold and replaced with cattle,
and this holding and “Peegurrima”
consolidated under the former title
and the management of Mr. Bun-
dock, who spent the best years of his
CHEST OF THE BUNDOCK FAMILY.
life on “Natal Downs” fighting
drought, low prices, and a huge
overdraft until illness necessitated
his residence in the South, when
Mr. Pat Salmon, as manager,
was handed the reins of control.
The owners at that time were
Mr. F. F. Bundock (father of
Mr. F. E. Bundock) and his brother
Mr. C. W. Bundock. Mr. Francis
Forbes Bundock, finding that his
health would not permit his
return to the North, sold out his in-
terests to Mr. Pat Salmon. He later
took over the management of “Wyan-
garie” on behalf of his parents. He
belonged to that distinguished class
who carried the influence of the high-
est culture into the hard pioneering
conditions of early settlement.
Severe droughts, low prices (fat
bullocks fetching at one time as low
a price as 30s. and fat cows ,£!),
epidemics amongst the stock and
other adverse visitations were some of
the obstacles with which he had to
contend. Most highly thought of by
his compeers in the industry, he was
an expert in all matters relating to
stock and prominently associated
with Agricultural Exhibitions of the
district in which he resided. He was
of the founders of the Burdekin
Meat Works. On July 4, 1884, he
married Mary Ellen, daughter of
Mr. Collings, a member of an
English family. Mrs. Bundock
shared his pioneering experiences
and cheerfully faced the hard-
ships and sacrifices incidental to
the early days. For domestic help
she had often to depend on the
services of the aboriginal women or
occasional Chinese labour. She and
his six children, all of whom, with
the exception of one daughter, were
born in Queensland, survive him.
His eldest son, Colonel Harry
Charles Bundock, D. 5.0., was
educated at the Sydney Grammar
School, and distinguished himself
during the late war of 1914-18.
Colonel Bundock, who has been in
the R.A.G.A. (Permanent Forces)
for some fifteen years, left Australia
for the scene of hostilities as a mem-
ber of the Heavy Artillery Siege
Brigade. For a time his unit was
attached to the Imperial Forces,
later it was transferred to the
A.1.F., and when peace was declared
MR. F. E. BUNDOCK.
it reverted to R.A.G.A. He was
three times mentioned in despatches.
Colonel Bundock married Dora,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jopp of
Sydney, where he is now attached to


the R.A.G.A. His youngest brother,
Mr. Albert Wellington Bundock,
who is an old boy of King’s School,
Parramatta, is engaged in pastoral
pursuits near Quambone, New South
Wales. The three daughters of the

Educated at the North Shore
Grammar School, Sydney, and at
King’s School, Parramatta, on the
completion of his collegiate career,
at “Bulliwallah” he went to “Natal
Downs” for further experience, and
after some time spent on this
property accepted a position on
“Bluff Downs” with the same object-
ive. In 1916, he acquired a share
in “Glendon” in partnership with
his maternal uncle, Mr. E. J. T.
Codings, a pioneer who has had life-
long experience of the cattle indus-
try in Queensland. At about this
time the urgent need of the Empire
for man power to carry to a success-
ful issue the great struggle for right
in which she was engaged, caused
him to volunteer for service abroad;
and in April, 1916, he was allotted
to the Artillery reinforcements of
the A.1.F., and in September of the
same year, sailed with his unit to
England. From the Motherland he
proceeded to the Western Front, and
the latter part of 1917 saw him in
action at Paschendaele. He served
in various other engagements ere
the rigours of service so seriously
undermined his health as to cause
his discharge from duty towards the
end of 1918. Immediately on his
return he proceeded to “Glendon”
and became engaged in the adminis-
tration and work of that property
in conjunction with his uncle, Mr.
E. J. T. Codings. Mr. F. E. Bun-
dock distinguished himself as a
scholar of King’s School, of which
he was “Dux,” or “Captain,” for
two years. He excelled in sport,
also, having been a particularly keen
footballer and Captain of the school

WILLIAM HECTOR GLAS-
SON, “Lara Downs,” Julia Creek,
was born at “Umbercollie,” near
Goondiwindi, Southern Queensland,
on January 25, 1892, and is the only
son of Mr. William Glasson, owner
of “Warkon” Station, near Yeulba,
with whom lie is interested in “Lara
Downs.” Educated at Newington
College, Sydney, on leaving school
he entered the pastoral industry at
“Umbercollie,” a property owned
by his maternal uncle, Mr. R. H.
Treweeke, which is fully described
in Volume I. of this work in an
article dealing with the latter
gentleman’s career. At “Umber-
collie” he spent four years, rising
from the post of jackaroo to overseer
and benefiting considerably by the
wide experience and expert know-
ledge of the industry for which Mr.
Treweeke is so well known. He re-
signed his position at “Umbercollie”
in the year 1913 and became em-
ployed at “Warkon,” his father’s
property, which was then personally
managed by Mr. Glasson, sen., under
whom he acted chiefly as overseer,
and gained an intimate knowledge
of pastoral administration. In the
year 1916 he was appointed to the
management of “Lara Downs,” then
recently purchased by Mr. W. Glas-
son, by whom he was admitted into
partnership, and whose interests in
the area he has since continued to
administer. “Lara Downs” embraces
some 70,000 acres of mixed timber
and downs country and is inter-
sected by limestone ridges. It has a
frontage of about twenty miles to
and at time of writing carries a fine
shorthorn herd, the number of which
generally averages about 3,000.

small stud herd, which, recently
inaugurated, is being built up from
choice-quality “Warkon” stock, and
promises to be an important feature
of the future operations on “Lara
Downs.” Seventy-five miles of
fencing has been erected on the run
for subdivisions and boundaries, and
most of this is of the style necessary
about fifty miles from Julia Creek,
which affords the nearest railway
communication. Mr. Glasson is a
member of the Flinders Club,
Hughenden. He married in the year
1917 Merle Enid, second daughter
of the late Benjamin Allen Bray,
who, a descendant of an old Cornish
family, came to Australia from
Yorkshire in the year 1887, in the
hope of overcoming the indifferent
state of health with which he was
affected in the Old Land. Mr. Bray
lived in the land of his adoption for
twenty-six years, and married here
Matilde von Strahley, a daughter of
a Bohemian of the patrician class
and an early Australian settler, who
emigrated from his native land as
the result of one of the political
upheavals which have at various
times agitated Bohemia. Mrs.
Bray’s father, shortly after his
arrival in this country, invested
largely in pastoral interests, and
resided in Australia until the occur-
rence of his death. Her mother was
the daughter of Colonel Russell, of
the English army, who, after his
retirement from the service, lived in
Alsace Lorraine with his wife at a
period dating about a hundred years
back, long before the late German
occupation of the country. The Brays
of Cornwall are of Celtic origin,
and their name is one of the most
highly esteemed in that County,
while in parts of Ireland it is asso-
ciated with various landed estates.
The Australian branch of the family

Wales, where several of Mrs.

“HARVEST HOME,” the prop-
erty of Mrs. Janet Cooper, wife
of Mr. Albert Hassell Cooper.
This historic station was founded
towards the end of 1865 by Mrs.
Cooper’s brother, the late Alexander
MacDonald, the only son of a
Scotch pioneer, the late Ranald
MacDonald, who made his advent to
Australia in “The Duncan,” the
third free emigrant ship to arrive in
Australian waters, and which, on
that particular trip, included
amongst its passengers Dr. Dobie,
the well-known founder of “Ram-
ornie” and “Gordon Brook,” sta-
tions which figure notably in the
pastoral history of the Mother
State. Ranald MacDonald was born
in the Scottish Highlands and was a
member of a very ancient branch of
the famous clan of the name. He
was accompanied to the country in
the settlement of which he was
destined to play so strenuous a part
by his young wife and her nephew
and niece, Alexander and Eliza
MacGregor, all of whom, after the
passing of many years of active
association with the work of nation
building, found their last I'esting
place on “Harvest Home.” Though
having had considerable experience
among stock in Scotland, the pioneer
at first set himself to the task of
acquiring, in a managerial capacity
on different stations in New South
Wales, first hand knowledge of the
conditions under which pastoral
pursuits were carried on in Australia.
While thus engaged, he was offered
the management of a property on the
Darling Downs, Queensland, the
having proceeded as far as “Corilla”
Station on the Richmond River—
when the news reached them of a
tragedy which had been recently
enacted on one of the stations which
MR. A. MACDONALD.
Mr. MacDonald had been appointed
to manage, the owner, when in a fit
of passion, having killed a man.
This circumstance made Mrs. Mac-
Donald so averse to continuing the
journey northward that her husband
decided to take up, in their locality,
a vacant block of pastoral country
which occupied a site between the
Richmond and Clarence Rivers and
had been originally selected, and
later abandoned, by the former
applied himself, making a home for
his family and carrying on there
as a grazing landowner for several
years, eventually disposing of it in
order to launch upon a venture of
larger jmssibilities in Northern
Queensland, only a comparatively
small portion of which, at the time,
was under settlement of any kind.
He took up “Eton Vale,” in the
vicinity of Bowen, in 1861, the long
overland journey to their new home
being undertaken in the same year
by his wife and three children —
Alexander MacDonald being then in
his teens —the mother and girls
travelling in one of the two bullock
drays which were used for the con-
veyance of their furniture, stores
and other effects from “Myrtle
Creek” to the North. At the same
time the “Myrtle Creek” stock
(cattle) were put on the roads and
the whole cavalcade, under the
direction of the pioneer, finally
reached their destination. At “Eton
Vale” he decided to go in for sheep
raising, but it was fated that finan-
cial disaster should crown his many
years of strenuous effort in the
South, for bad seasons, lack of
water conservation, the prevailing
low price of wool, and the unsuit-
ability of the country for sheep
(experience bought very dearly for
later comers by those who trekked
north in the sixties) proved too dis-
astrous a combination to be overcome
at a time when expenses were
abnormal and the high rate of inter-
est on borrowed money debarred
many from availing themselves of
financial aid. Ranald MacDonald

“Myrtle Creek” was the designation

for his widow and her two daughters.

whom they were always on friendly
terms. In the year 1865, Alexander
MacDonald, with the remaining
members of the family, proceeded
further north, and took up 400
square miles of country bounded by
the Cape and Rolleston Rivers. He
depastured there a very small mob
of cattle, the salvage from “Eton
Vale,” and started operations on
what came to be regarded as one of
the pioneer holdings of the locality,
the only others then existing being
“Mt. McConnell” (situated 20 miles
away and owned by the Henry
family, their nearest neighbours),
“Natal Downs,” “Ravenswood” and
“St. Ann’s.” The late Alexander
MacDonald named the property
“Harvest Home,” and continued to
work it as a cattle run until the
time of his death, which occurred
in May of the year 1882. He had
never married, and after the sad
event his mother and her youngest
daughter, Janet MacDonald (now
Mrs. Cooper) decided they would
carry on the work where he had left
off. Thenceforward, the practical
management of the run devolved
upon the latter, who, born and bred
in the bush, proved fully equal to
the part she thereafter played in
pastoral history by developing the
resources of the large mileage of
Northern Queensland in which the
family interests were centred. Mrs.
MacDonald’s policy and her
daughter’s method of putting it into
effect were such as to win golden
opinions from stock owners of the
period. Janet MacDonald was

est daughter of the late Ranald
MacDonald became the wife of Mr.
Ceilings, and her son is now in part-
nership with Mr. F. E. Bundock in
“Glendon” Station, near Charters
Towers. Mr. Albert Hassall Cooper
was part owner with his brother in
the liistoric “Mt. McConnell” and
“Ravenswood” Stations from 1873 to
1882. Born at Lake George and
educated chiefly by private tuition
in Sydney, he had spent, before
going north, many years in bush
avocations, his father, the late
Francis Cooper, having been one of
the original pastoralists of the Lake
George, Goulburn and Manaroo dis-
tricts, the name being very promin-
ently identified with the pastoral
development of the last-mentioned
locality. He has considerable inter-
ests in Sydney, between which city
and “Harvest Home” he and Mrs.
Cooper have divided their time
for the past forty years. Their
charming Sydney home, where they
live retired from business cares,
overlooks Double Bay. Mr. Cooper
is a brother of Chief Justice Cooper,
and, though taking no part in public
life, is a student of world affairs,
particularly of such as have a bear-
ing on industrial, economic and
general conditions in Australia.
With his wonderfully retentive
memory is combined the gift of the
raconteur, and his reminiscences of
the early days of Queensland and
New South Wales are extremely in-
teresting and instructive. Mr. A.
H. Cooper died on March 5, 1922.

TELLO, who, with Mr. QUIRK
COSTELLO, of “Windsor” Station,
are sons of the late Andrew Costello.
The last-mentioned gentleman was
one of the most sterling, upright,
and capable pastoralists of his day,
and a pioneer of the stamp to which
Australia owes the rapid advance of
settlement and the expansion of the
great industry upon which she still
so largely depends for her prosperity.
Born at Wallslough, Kilkenny, Ire-
land, Mr. Andrew Costello was
descended from an old farming
family which has been engaged in
primary production in his native
land for many successive generations.
In Ireland the name is associated
with various events that authentic

ago. From Brisbane he made his
way to Ipswich, where, at that time,
ample employment was to be found.
He had not been long in Ipswich ere
the possibilities of the goldfields,
which had yielded such sensational
results in New South Wales and Vic-
toria during the fifties drew his
energies southwards, and thencefor-
ward he battled through the terrible
hardships incidental to the mining
industry at the time, gaining a wide
knowledge of life and humanity
amidst conditions which brought out
the best and worst characteristics of
mankind and under which only the
fittest might hope to survive. His
efforts yielded him varying fortune
until 1868, when the rush to the
Gyrnpie goldfield occurred and found
him among the first arrivals at that
centre. He travelled from Victoria

after the Gyrnpie gold discovery the
banks of the Palmer, a short time
previously uninhabited and unknown,
became the site of a canvas town,
which sheltered multitudes who


liad come in search of the yellow
metal, among whom Mr. Costello was
a foremost arrival. At the Palmer,
also, he had some rough experiences,
his reminiscences of this period of
his career, including much of interest
relating to the aborigines of that
locality, with whom the miners had
some dangerous encounters, and
whom the late gentleman was wont
to describe as a very cunning and
hostile tribe. From the Palmer he
proceeded to Charters Towers, where
he continued operations in the in-
dustry on his own account, subse-
quently undertaking the management
of a mine. This post was followed
by others of a similar nature, which,
with his own mining ventures, suc-
cessively occupied his energies until
the middle seventies, when he relin-
quished the mining for the pastoral
industry. His home in the Charters
Towers district was at what is known
as the Seventy-mile Creek, and here
he resided for many years, carrying
on both pastoral and carrying opera-
tions the while, and proving himself
possessed of an indomitable spirit
which adversity was unable to
daunt, and anxiety for those depend-
ent upon him ever spurred to
greater effort. He had teams oper-
ating from Townsville and Charters
Towers to the various holdings in
the district, and by his reliability,
honesty, and good feeling, earned
the respect of all with whom he had
dealings. Eventually he sold the
teams and devoted himself solely to
his pastoral interests, which he
enlarged in the year 1901 by the
purchase of “Fanning Downs,” and,
subsequently, of “Mount Ravens-
wood,” in the same district, which
he bought from the late J. H. Clark,
of “Lornesleigh,” in the year 1906.
A brief review of the vicissitudes
which he experienced during his
pastoral career will afford some idea
of the force of character and
strength of will of which he was
possessed. Among the most severe
of his adversities in the industry
were those caused by the drought of
1895, which destroyed the results of
many years of arduous labour and
robbed him of all his breeders, thus
making the possibility of building
up a new herd a big financial
problem. This problem he solved,
however, on the termination of the
drought by the purchase of a fresh
mob of breeders, which he had no
sooner placed on the pastures before
a new visitation followed on the heels
of the last in the shape of the disas-
trous tick pest and its accompanying

fatal fever, which wrought such
havoc among the herds of Queensland
during the years 1896 and 1897,
before inoculation was resorted to as
a preventative measure. Like the
surrounding pastoralists, many of
whom were ruined, Mr. Costello was
a heavy loser through the tick fever,
but he fought on, hoping to tide over
the bad times, until, finally, it
seemed as if his every effort was
doomed, for the worst drought the
country has known in the memory of
man —that which lasted from 1901-3
and robbed Australia of so large a
percentage of its horned and woolly
stock—claimed from him its toll.
The result was that he was faced with
financial disaster. At this grave
crisis of his affairs his sterling char-
acter proved his greatest asset, being
recognized by a banking institution
which knew him as a man of fore-
sight and exceptional industry also,
and one who was excellently versed
in all matters relating to stock.
From this bank he received the
funds necessary for the re-stocking of
his runs, and in a short time, the
recuperative powers of the country
coming to his aid, was rewarded
by comparative prosperity. At the
time of his death, which occurred at
“Fanning Downs” in the year 1907,
he was well on the high road to suc-
cess. Few men have possessed or
deserved to a greater extent the
esteem of their fellows than did the
late Andrew Costello, who was
always ready to lend a helping hand
to his neighbours or those less fav-
oured by fortune than himself.
During his long pastoral career, as
in his previous callings, his work
claimed the greater portion of his
time, and he had little leisure to
devote to public affairs. He was a
member of the Towers Pastoral,
Agricultural, and Mining Asso-
ciation. For many years pre-
ceding his death he was a
member of the Hibernian Society,
the interests of which he was active
in forwarding in his earlier life. He
married in Charters Towers in the
year 1880 Bridget Lilly Brennan, of
“Ballyadno,” Queen’s County, an
Irishwoman by birth and descent,
and a wife and mother of the finest
type, who played no small part in
the work of settlement in the days
when her husband fought droughts,
fires, and floods “outback.” Of the
union there survives a family of three
sons. Mrs. Costello pre-deceased
her husband by three years, the
date of her death, which also
occurred at “Fanning Downs,” being
1904. PATRICK MAURICE COS-
TELLO, her eldest son, was born in
Charters Towers in the year 1882,
and educated at T. Martin’s Gram-
mar School, Charters Towers. From
his early childhood he has been
associated with cattle, and in all that
pertains to them he is widely ex-
perienced. In boyhood he was able
to render valuable assistance to his
father in the work of the runs, and,
as he approached manhood, his know-
ledge of stock and station work was
such as to relieve the elder man of
the more arduous duties of adminis-
tration. After the death of Mr.
Andrew Costello he received a third
share in the family estates, which, in
the year 1908, were handed by the
executors to the three brothers, who
jointly carried on “Fanning Downs”
and “Mount Ravenswood” from that
date, adding to their interests in
1911 by the purchase of “Haughton
Valley.” From “Haughton Valley”
they transferred the stock to “Fan-
ning Downs” and “Mount Ravens-
wood,” thereafter selling the lease
and improvements of the former pro-
perty to Mr. P. J. Latham. “Mount
Ravenswood” was disposed of in
1913, and the sole interests in
“Fanning Downs” being purchased
by Mr. A. J. Costello, a dissolution
of partnership was mutually agreed
to by the brothers. In the year 1914
Mr. P. Maurice Costello became by
purchase the owner of “Windsor”
Station, which adjoins “Redbank,”
a property that earlier in the same
year had been acquired by his brother
Quirk. This transaction caused a
partnership to be established between
the two, and the consolidation of
“Windsor” and “Redbank” into a
single which was con-
ducted by Messrs. P. M. and Quirk
Costello for three years. The former-
sold out to his brother in 1917 and
the partnership came to an end. In
the same year, immediately after
selling out to Quirk, Maurice Cos-
tello bought “Fanning Downs,” thus
establishing with his second brother
the partnership between them which
exists at the present time. Though
making cattle his chief study-, Mr.
Maurice Costello is keenly interested
in equine stock, and in conjunction
with his brothers has dealt ex-
tensively both in cattle and
horses. At one time as many as
600 bought horses were held on

trict in which he resides, and is pro-
minent among those who are active
in encouraging industrial develop-
ment, being a member and commit-
teeman of the Towers Pastoral, Agri-
cultural, and Mining Association. A
good supporter of clean sport, he is
a member of the Towers Jockey
Club. Other bodies which claim his
interest include the Charters Towers
Civic Club. In the year 1913, Mr.
P. M. Costello married Mary A.,
daughter of the late William Sadd,
of English birth, who made his
advent to Charters Towers in the
very early days of that town, of
which for long he was one of the
notable identities. Sadd’s Ridge, on
the Charters Towers field, is named
after him. Mr. Sadd died at “Bar-
ringha,” a cattle property in the
Townsville district, of which he had
been in ownership for some twenty
years previously. ANDREW JOS-
EPH COSTELLO, the second son
of the late pioneer, was born at the
Seventy-mile Creek in the year 1884.
On the conclusion of his education,
which was pursued at Nudgee Col-
lege, Brisbane, he became engaged
in the cattle industry under the
supervision of his late father, having
been familiar with stock from child-
hood upwards. As previously stated,
he retained “Fanning Downs” when
the three brothers dissolved partner-
ship six years after the death of the
late Andrew Costello, and since then
has continued to hold it, first on his
own account solely, and later in part-
nership with his eldest brother. Mr.
A. J. Costello is an enthusiastic
horse lover, and has owned three or
four very good racehorses, which have
led in some important turf events.
He also has interested himself

in public affairs, and is one of
the committee of the Towers Pastoral,
Agricultural, and Mining Associa-
tion, a member of the Charters
Towers Civic Club and of the
Towers Jockey Club. In the year
1913 he married Clarence C., daugh-
ter of the late Thomas Naughton, a
former resident of Charters Towers.
QUIRK COSTELLO, “Windsor,”
was born at Charters Towers, North-
ern Queensland, on March 21, 1887,
and is the third surviving son of the
late Andrew Costello. Educated at
Nudgee College, he continued at that
well-known academical seat until of
an age to enter seriously upon the
duties of a pastoral career, when he
returned to the paternal rooftree.
After a brief period, during which
he was engaged in general stock and
station work at “Fanning Downs,”
he was given more responsible duties
at “Mount Ravenswood,” of which
he was appointed manager in the
year 1906. He held this post after
the death of his father as managing
partner on behalf of the firm of
Costello Brothers, and continued to
carry out the duties incidental
thereto until the year 1913, when
“Mount Ravenswood” was sold.
After the settlement of this trans-
action and the dissolution of the
partnership between the brothers
Mr. Quirk Costello became the


purchaser ol Redbank, which he
carried on for a year before being
joined in partnership by his brother
Maurice, who had then recently
acquired \\ indsor, the adjoining
run. The two properties were
amalgamated and run as a single

down in history as responsible for the
foundation of Townsville, which was
called after the former gentleman,
the Black River, in the vicinity of
Townsville, having received its
designation in compliment to the
latter. Situated some 14 miles from
Charters Towers and one from
Macrossan, a railway station on the
Townsville-Charters Towers line, the
“Fanning Downs” homestead com-
mands a picturesque view of downs
and timbered country. The main
building is of modern design and is
both roomy and comfortable. Good
solid yards and outbuildings occupy
suitable sites in its vicinity, and the
whole displays an aspect of orderli-
ness which is everywhere apparent
on the run, and speaks volumes for
the up-to-date methods of the
brothers. “Windsor” and its out-
station, “Redbank,” the properties
of Mr. Quirk Costello, are princip-
ally comprised of open forest country
and are well clothed with many
varieties of indigenous grasses. The
two runs aggregate an area of over
100 square miles, and are excellently
watered by wells to which are
attached engines and windmills.
The progressive policy of the owner
is everywhere apparent on the runs,
which carry a fine herd that was
founded many years ago by the late
H. C. Hurle, and now averages a
strength of about 3,000 head, which,
under Mr. Costello’s regime , is kept
up to a high standard of quality by
the introduction of bulls from “Bluff
Downs” and other well-known studs.
Horses are bred for station use only.
“Windsor” was originally taken up
and stocked by the late Thomas Far-
renden, and subsequently passed to
Mr. Hurle, who held it for over
thirty-five years. The “Windsor”
homestead, which is modern and well
built and occupies a site distant 20
miles from Charters Towers, stands
on an eminence from which is dis-
closed an extensive view of well-
grassed and timbered country. It
stands out picturesquely against the
landscape, of which it makes a
pleasing feature as it is viewed from
the Charters Towers road. Very up-
to-date outbuildings occupy a suit-
able position in its vicinity, and in
and about the homestead are further
evidences of the energy and pro-
gressiveness which are characteristic
traits of the owner of this property.

GEORGE EUGENE CORE was
born at Fareliam, Hampshire, Eng-
land, on September 6, 1879, and is
the second eon of the late Eugene
George Corps, who, for many years,
MR. G. CORPS.
was head of the firm of Clark & Co.,
general merchants and wool-brokers
of Fareham and Winchester. Des-
cended from an old English family,
which in that ancient city and its
MR. W. MCDOWALL, SEN.
County and in neighbouring Shires,
had been prominently associated
with commerce for a considerable
period, the subject of this memoir,
shortly after assuming citizenship in
Australia, caused the spelling of his
name to agree phonetically with the
pronunciation that had been handed
down by many generations of his
ancestors, as in his new environ-
ment the reversal of this arrange-
ment was becoming the rule. Edu-
cated in his native land at a
scholastic establishment in Dulwich,
Surrey, Mr. Core, on the conclusion
of his earlier studies, underwent a
course of training in engineering, on
the termination of which he followed
this calling in England for a period.
Being possessed of a temperament to
which the sparsely settled portions
of the great Empire abroad had a
strong appeal, he set out for Africa
shortly after reaching manhood, and
there resided for four years, during
MR. G. E. CORE.
which he saw much of life in the
Transvaal and Orange River Colony,
for a time making his headquarters
in Johannesburg. In South Africa
his work was much among stock, in
which connection he dealt consider-
ably in cattle and horses. In the
year 1908, he returned to England,
but finding the climatic conditions
uncongenial decided to again settle
in a sunnier land, and very shortly
set out for Tasmania. Since his
advent to the lands which lie under
the Southern Cross he has devoted
his energies largely to pastoral w r ork,
gaining a first-hand knowledge of
the conditions under which the in-
dustry is conducted and the best,
methods of breeding and working
stock. The year 1914 witnessed his
advent to Townsville, Northern
Queensland, whence he proceeded to
“Christmas Creek’’ to take over the
management of that station in the
interests of the McDowall Estate. A
share in this property afterwards

passed to Mr. Core and his wife,
and, as managing partner of the
firm, G. & M. Core, he continued to
administer affairs here until 1920,
when “Christmas Creek’’ was sold.
MR. A. MCDOWALL.
During the latter part of the same
year he took up a block of about 70
miles of excellent cattle country,
which formerly had been included
within the boundaries of “Christmas


Creek.” On this area was bestowed
the name of “Blue Range,” and here
Mr. Core has since devoted his
energies to the improvement of the
old type of shorthorn which
MR. W. MCDOWA LL.
depastured the country. A fine
homestead was erected at “Christ-
mas Creek,” before “Blue Range”
was defined as a separate holding,
and the two dwellings occupy sites
within a few miles of each other.
In the year 1915 he married Mary
Ada, third daughter of the late Wil-
liam McDowall, and of the union
there is a son and a daughter —
generation of a well-known Aus-
tralian family. Born at “Logan

1847, he was a son of Archibald
McDowall, of “Logan,” Bothwell,

continued as a
member of Mr.
Archibald Mc-
Dowall’s staff for
four years, at the
end of which,
being strongly at-
tracted by the
possibilities of the
pastoral industry,
he secured a stock
position at the
“Valley of the
Lagoons” under the founders of
that station, the Messrs. Scott
Bros. He continued to acquire
pastoral experience as an employe on
different properties until the year
1878, when he struck out on his own
account and formed “Welcome
Downs” and “Cashmere” holdings,
the latter containing the site of a
former telegraph station, which,
when closed and disused, was
acquired by the late gentleman and
converted into the “Cashmere”
homestead. He stocked “Cashmere”
with cattle from “Dotswood” Sta-
tion, and completed many improve-
ments on the property, of which he
continued in ownership for five years.
In 1883, having sold the area, he
proceeded to Tasmania and remained
there for a period. Preferring the
wider spaces of the “outback” to
the more closely-settled conditions of
his native isle, it was not long before
he was again actively interested in
pastoral pursuits in Northern
Queensland, where he became the

owner of “Lake Lucy," a station
which he purchased unstocked from
the Messrs. Scott Bros., and
subsequently depastured with cattle
obtained from various local holdings.
For seventeen years “Lake Lucy’’
continued to be his headquarters and
the scene of many vicissitudes —of
heart-breaking experiences resultant
from droughts, pleuro, tick fever,
and other adversities, all of which,
however, were overcome with an
indomitableness of spirit which
proved impervious to disaster. Imme-
diately before the ticks started their
devastating work, he transacted a
deal with Messrs. Fenwick and
Ramsden for the exchange of “Lake
Lucy” for a station known as
“Kangaroo Hills,” and the acquire-
ment of this property proved the first
step in that success which was
to eventually crown his efforts. He
effected considerable improvement on
the area, which had already been
visited by the pest which wrought so
much havoc on “Lake Lucy” and
the surrounding
runs before Inocu-
lation was used to
counteract the re-
sultant fever. At
the termination of
four years he sold
“Kangaroo Hills’'*"
and purchased
“Green Vale” Sta-
tion, and added
to its acreage by
the repurchase of
“Cashmere,” his
original holding,
which he held and
conducted with
“Green Vale” for a
considerable period.
During the early
years of the present century
“Cashmere" was again sold, the pur-
chaser being Mr, R. Atkinson, the


present owner. ‘‘Basalt Downs,”
‘‘Lucky Downs,” and ‘‘Pandanus
Creek” were then acquired by Mr.
McDowall, and worked by him in
conjunction with ‘‘Green Yale.” At
this period his various holdings

square miles of country stocked to

the fullest carrying capacity. During
the remaining years of his active
association with the industry he fol-
lowed a policy of purchasing and
improving properties with a view to
selling advantageously. He sold
“Pandanus Creek” to Mr. A. B.
Calcott and replaced this run
amongst his holdings with the pur-
chase of ‘‘Southwick” from the
Messrs. Aplin Bros. After holding
"Southwick” for a brief period a
profitable transfer of the area was
and held by Mr. McDowall until
the time of his death, which occurred
in Townsville in the year 1918. No
property ever passed through his
hands without having benefited con-
siderably in the matter of develop-
ment, and he thus added in no small
degree to the prosperity of the State
and the advancement of the industry,
which suffered a distinct loss by his
removal. Though the chief factor in
many movements instituted for the
advancement of the district, he
avoided, as far as possible, publicity
in such matters. His advice and
experience were ever at the service
of the community, and constantly
availed of, and the geniality and
kindliness of his disposition were
proverbial. In his wide pastoral
operations his predilection was chiefly
Queensland, and the importation of
Zebu cattle from India for experi-
mental purposes. His marriage
occurred in February of the year
1875 to Elizabeth, daughter of the
late Charles Shumaker, who made
his advent to Australia nearly half
a century ago, and is recorded as
one of the first arrivals at Ravens-
wood and other fields discovered
during the seventies. Mr. and Mrs.
McDowall had a family of three sons
and four daughters. To the latter
should be accorded all honour for
the part she played as wife, mother,
and comrade during more than forty
years of married life, and for the
encouragement, sympathy, and prac-
tical support with which she unfail-
aided the efforts of the pioneer,
proving his stay in times of stress as
well as in the days when fortune
rewarded his labours as they
deserved. One of her sons died in
infancy; another, Frederick, met
with a fatal riding accident at
Townsville in the year 1918; and the
third, Robert, is engaged in pastoral
pursuits in Northern Queensland as
managing owner of ‘‘Abingdon
Downs,” which he holds in conjunc-
tion with Mr. Rogers, of Sydney.
Mr. Robert McDowall was in part-
nership with his father for some time
prior to the death of the latter, and
was engaged in the management of
‘‘Christmas Creek” for a period. Of
the daughters of the pioneer, one
married Mr. R. Brooks-Watson, who
is prominently known in commercial
made to Mr. Malone. In 1906 he
sold “Green Vale” to Mr. H. J. At-
kinson, and immediately afterwards
purchased “Abingdon Downs” from
the firm of Curr Bros. “Christmas

association with some of the most
notable achievements in the pastoral
industry, which assumed its prestige
in the industrial life of the world
owing to the pluck, endurance, and
enterprise of such men as he.
Previous to his death “Lornesleigh’'
and “Mt. McConnell” passed to the
elder of his daughters, Mrs. R. G.
Bell. Mr. Bell is also largely
interested in the industry and
supervises the administration of
these properties and “Cranbourne
Park” and surrounding pastoral
lands, all of which are charac-
terized by well-grassed undulating
plains, open forest country, and
occasional patches of gidya scrub
land, and usually referred to under
the general designation of “Lornes-
leigh.” The various blocks, which
comprise about 700 square miles of
country, are intersected by the
Selheim, Cape, and Suttor Rivers,
many creeks and a large number of
lagoons, and by these sources are
most generously endowed with water
of so permanent a nature that
“Lornesleigh” may be described as a
very “safe” property in all seasons.
A fine shorthorn herd roams over the
different pastures and aggregates a
strength of 20,000. It was estab-
lished by the founder of “Lornes-
leigh,” the late John Henry Clark,
who was one of the most progressive
cattle men of his time, and a
thorough and practical believer in
the rules laid down by experts for
the better breeding of the type. The
widely known excellence of the
“Lornesleigh” stock is a tribute to
the wisdom of his methods and to
those of his son-in-law, portion of
whose early experience in the
industry was gained under the super-
vision and direction of the pioneer.
At the present time about 150
horses are depastured, and, like the
horned stock, uphold the reputation
which was made for the holdings in
the time of Mr. Clark, in whose day
it was said that “Lornesleigh” was
one of the few station properties on
which horse-breeding paid really
well. The late gentleman made a
great name for the station, more
particularly as a breeding centre for
draught horses, being so successful in
this department of his operations
that the 4.J.C. brand more than
held its own in open market and
against all competitors. Tie also
bred mounts for the Indian market
and for sale locally. Since his

day, the development which he
inaugurated has been advanced con-
siderably, so that “Lornesleigh”
MR. W. F. BELL.
deservedly ranks amongst the most
highly improved Northern Queens-
land properties. “Mt. McConnell”


was originally founded by a Mr.
Henry, another of the men who bat-
tled so gallantly in (he early days of
the North. From him it went to the
MR. R. G. BELL.
Cooper family, later passing through
different hands until, in 1905, it was
purchased from the erstwhile A. J. S.
Bank by Mr. Clark. The three hold-
ings, “Lornesleigh,” “Mt. McCon-
nell,” and “Cranbourne Park,” are
possessed of very comfortable and
up-to-date homesteads. “Cranbourne
Park” is of quite recent erection and
its grounds are in course of forma-
tion, although already a certain
amount of horticulture adds that
touch of natural charm without
which the most artistically designed
structure is wanting. This home
commands a very fine view of plains
from which rises in majestic beauty
Mt. McConnell, a very historical
feature, inasmuch as it marks a stage
in the perilous overland journey from
Brisbane to Port Essington of the
explorer Leichhardt, who discovered
this territory in the year 1845 and
named Mt. McConnell, from which
one of the properties takes its name,
and many of the waterways here-
abouts. Another very beautiful
feature of the locality is the expan-
sive lagoon which supplies “Cran-
bourne Park,” and which in the
memory of the white inhabitants of
the district, has never been known
to fail. The “Cranbourne Park”
homestead is now the station head-
quarters of Mr. and Mrs. Bell and
their family, who quite recently
moved there from the “Lornesleigh”
home, and continue to carry out the
traditions established by their
forbears for that hospitality which,
in times past, was one of the notable
characteristics of the pioneer homes.
They spend a part of each year in
Charters Towers, where, in Plant
Street, they have a very modern and
artistic residence which is surrounded
by beautifully kept grounds. The
MR. T. J. BELL.
late JOHN HENRY CLARK was
born in the year 1823 in Murunei,
near Maitland, New South Wales,
where his father was engaged on the
land. The death of the latter
caused him, when at an early age,
to be placed in the care of an uncle,
from whose guardianship, however,
he broke away at the age of thirteen
to fight his own way in life among
the hardy settlers of the Mother
State. Thenceforward his life was
one of pioneering achievement-—in
New South Wales until his forty-
ninth year, and subsequently in
Queensland. As a young man he was
renowned as an athlete and an
equestrian, his knowledge of horses
amounting to a gift. He was part-
owner, with Messrs. Foster and Vind
of a line of coaches which plied from
his headquarters in New South
Wales to Beechworth, Victoria, and
he drove the first mail coach to enter
that town, a circumstance which
eventuated in the year 1850. His
operations were later directed to
many of the early New South Wales
goldfields, to which he ran coaches.
The year 1861 witnessed his arrival
in Queensland and the completion of
a long and dangerous journey from
the Maclntyre River, whence he had
driven a mob of cattle for the stock-
ing up of “Salisbury Plains,” then
owned by Mr. Holt. His party
included Mr. Norris, who was after-
wards Warden’s Orderly in Charters
Towers, and the late Mr. Bailey, of
Milchester. Contemporaneously with
the original journey to Queensland
made by Mr. Clark, several other
gentlemen who were destined to play
a notable part in the settlement of
the State were en route with stock
to the then little known North of
the newly established Colony, among

hams, Mr. Edward Cunningham,

engaged in his carrying operations,
which he conducted with waggons
and teams between Bowen and the
“Mount Cornish” and “Bowen
Downs” Stations, taking out stores
and returning with wool. “Mount
Cornish” was then owned by the
pioneer Edkins. Bowen was the
principal port for the whole district
of Northern Queensland in those
days, and the excellent pastoral lands
outlying the town offered exceptional
possibilities for investors, among
whom was Mr. Clark, who, while
engaged as a carrier, took up “Mt.
Pleasant.” This jiroperty, which
became a well-known holding, sub-
sequently passed from Mr. Clark,
who, in the seventies, went further

greater possibilities in independent
enterprise as a carrier, he severed
miles from Bowen, and there acquired
a considerable acreage of freehold
land and erected an hotel, making

date he purchased “Mt. McConnell,”

was added to his pastoral interests.
All these properties had the benefit
of his wide experience in the
industry, and ranked among the
most highly developed and improved
of his time. “Lornesleigh” was his
home from the early seventies until
a week or two of his death, which
occurred on Christmas Day of tha
year 1917, in the ninety-fifth year
of his age, at his daughter’s home in
Charters Towers. He was a rare
judge of cattle and horses, and the
North has benefited in no small
degree through his methods of breed-
ing both shorthorn and equine stock,
some very fine bulls and stud book
stallions having been given a home
on his properties. He married a
daughter of the late George Geary,
who was one of the very early
pioneers of the Lake George district
of New South Wales, where he
settled when the present important
and prosperous State was an infant
Colony. This lady resides at “Gros-

her daughters. MR. RICHARD
GEORGE BELL was born at Cran-
bourne, \ ictoria, forty-seven years
ago, and is the third surviving son
of Mr. Patrick Bell, who now resides
in retirement at Trafalgar in
Victoria. Of Scottish origin, the old
family of which he is a member was
established in Australia a century
ago, when the late Patrick Bell, his
grandfather, having severed the ties
which bound him to the land of his
birth and voyaged to the new land
under the Southern Cross, there
made his home. He is recorded as
one of the pioneers of the Cran-
bourne district, having settled in the
Sister State long before it was
granted its own constitution as
an independent Colony of Great
Britain. The original Patrick Bell
had four sons, and of this family the
only surviving member is Mr. Patrick
Bell of Trafalgar, Victoria, the
father of Mr. Bell, of “Cranbourne
Park.” Born at Geelong, Mr.
Patrick Bell spent his life in
pastoral and agrarian pursuits

was prominent in racing circles in
the early days of Melbourne. His
wife was Margaret Lawless, who, a
native of Kilkenny, Ireland, accom-
panied her widowed mother and two
brothers to Australia when the
country was yet young in the making.
One of this lady’s brothers was
Thomas Lawless, who, in his day,
was accredited with being the best
horseman in Australia. Early Aus-
tralian records mention his name as
prominent amongst the members of
the Police Force at the time the
notorious bushrangers forming the
Kelly Gang terrorised the settlers of
Victoria and parts of New South
Wales. Of the union of Patrick Bell
and Margaret Lawless there survives
a family of four sons and four
daughters. Three of the sons are
settled in Queensland, these being
Messrs. Richard George, Thomas
James and John Patrick Bell. The
last-mentioned is the eldest of the
family and now engaged in pastoral
pursuits at “Cardigan” Station in
the vicinity of Charters Towers.
Educated at the Cranbourne School,
Mr. Richard George Bell became en-
gaged in grazing and agricultural
pursuits on his father’s acres at a
very early age. On reaching man-
hood be followed the lead of his
brother, and set out for Queensland,
making his advent to the Kennedy
district nearly a quarter of a century
ago. His first position here was as
jackaroo at “Cardigan” Station, at
that time in the ownership of Mr.
Thomas Buckland, one of the pioneer
pastoralists of the district and then
the holder, also, of “St. Ann’s” and
“Yacamunda” Stations, the sites of
which lie between Charters Towers
and Bowen. These two stations were
originally held by the late Duncan
Maclntyre, whose death occurred in
the Gulf in the year 1865, when en-
gaged in searching for traces of the
missing explorer Leichhardt; and
they wei’e worked by the late John
and William Bell, uncles of Mr, R.
G. Bell, for many years before com-
ing into the hands of Mr. Buckland.

the Bell family remained unmarried.

was advanced in the face of very
grave danger from the aboriginal in-
habitants, many tragedies having
been enacted in the vicinity of those
two stations. At one of them a Chin-
ese cook was surprised and murdered
during the absence of the brothers;
and continual and wanton destruc-
tion was wrought amongst the herds.
At "Cardigan,” Mr. R. G. Bell
remained for a period spread over
eight and a half years, during six
of which he carried out the duties of
head stockman, having thus been
given a thorough insight into the
practical side of station management.
On leaving “Cardigan” he proceeded
to “Yacamunda,” where he spent a
brief period only ere being appointed
by Mr. Clark to the position of head
stockman at “Lornesleigh.” lie
took up his duties here on January
6, 1906, and a year later was
appointed to the management of the
property, and thenceforward, until
six months subsequent to the death
of the pioneer, Mr. J. H. Clark, so
long and popularly known as Clark
of “Lornesleigh,” was occupied with
the duties incidental to the position.
In the year 1918 he took up a block
of land of 46,896 acres on “Mt.
McConnell,” when portion of that
run was resumed by the Government
in following its closer settlement
policy, and he now runs this area
(which he named “Cranbourne
Park” after the locality which had
been the home of two generations of
the family) in conjunction with his
wife’s estate, entrusting the manage-
ment of their joint landed interests
to the capable administration of Mr.
Thomas James Bell. During the
whole period since he became asso-
ciated with pastoral work, he has
devoted himself principally to the
industry and incidentally to those
movements whose aim and object it
is to advance its prospects and the
interests of the district generally.
Always a lover and an owner of a

JOHN SYMES, “Bletchington
Park,” Charters Towers, was born
near Murandy, in the Mudgee
district, New South Wales, on
March 22, 1860, and is the
MR. F. H. SYMES.
fourth son of the late Francis Hoare
Symes, who, as a young man, came
to Australia from Dorsetshire,
England, where his distant and
immediate ancestors, in their respec-
tive generations, had been closely
associated, as graziers and agricul-
turists, with the development of the
County, and particularly well known
as breeders of blood horses. For
some time previous to his death, which
occurred in April of the year 1875,
the late Francis Hoare Symes was
settled in business in Gulgong, New
South Wales, and, in connection
with his interests there, visited
Charters Towers immediately after
that goldfield had been proclaimed.
Here, in 1872, he contracted the
fever which appears to be insepar-
able from the advance of settlement
in virgin country, and two years
later, some time after his return to
the Mother State (then Colony)
died of its effects. Very shortly
after their bereavement, his widow,
five sons and a daughter, left their
home in the South and proceeded
to Northern Queensland, the poten-
tialities of which had been repre-
sented to them by the founder of
the line under the Southern Cross.
Coming of a family which, in the
Old World, had made horses a
speciality of their callings, the sons
took full advantage of the good
market, which existed for many
years following their arrival, by trad-
ing in equine stock between New
South Wales and Queensland, mak-
ing their purchases in the Southern
State and overlanding them to their
Northern market. With this phase
of pastoral operations they later
combined dairying on a property
the family held on the goldfield.
Thirteen years after their advent
to the North, the Symes brothers
found themselves in a position to
enlarge the sphere of their activities
by the purchase, in the year 1888,
of the old holding known as ‘‘Bletch-
ington Park,” which was then un-
stocked. The brothers at once
proceeded to develop and restock it,
founding a herd with a good strain

of milking shorthorns which they had
acquired on the goldfield in the
course of their dairying operations,
which, by the way, they relinquished
on the acquirement of the station
property. By the introduction of
well-bred bulls from highly reputed
studs in the South, the herd was
built up gradually, until the excel-
lent type of beef cattle which now
is seen on the pastures replaced the
dairying strain. “Bletchington Park”
was run under the joint ownership
of the brothers for thirty-two years,
at the termination of which period,
in 1920, Mr. John Symes purchased
the remaining proprietary interests
and took his eldest son into partner-
ship. Situated 33 miles from Char-
ters Towers, it embraces over 100
square miles of excellent cattle coun-
try that is made up of open forest
and a small proportion of scrub
lands, the run being remarkable for
the great variety of its timbers. Its
history dates back to the seventies,
when it was established as a pastoral
run by the late Mr. Haynes, who
gave* it the name “Bletchington
Park.” At a later date it was
acquired by Mr. Charters, the first
Warden of Charters Towers, who
conducted grazing and dairying
operations within its boundaries for
some time after relinquishing his
official post. Subsequently, the
holding came into the possession of
the Queensland National Bank,
Ltd., from whom it was purchased
by the subject of this memoir and
his brothers. Wells and dams
equipped with engines and wind-
mills provide its water supply,
and cattle continue to be its main-
stay. In the past the Messrs. Symes
Bros, made its name notable by the
type of blood horse which they bred
and (the frequent successes which
they achieved with their stock on
the turf. Among the numerous
events with which the brothers’
names are associated as the owners
of winning horses, are the A.J.C.

the Towers Handicap, all of which

Irish stock, was a native of Victoria,
For a considerable part of his active
career the late gentleman was well
and favourably known as a mine
manager of Charters Towers, of
which well-known gold mining centre
he was one of the pioneers. His
widow now resides with her daughter
and son-in-law at ‘Bletchington
Park.” Mrs. Carney, who comes of
pure Celtic stock, was born in
Jersey, of the Channel Islands. Of
the union of Mr. and Mrs. Symes
there is a family of two sons and
a daughter. The elder of the sons,
Mr. William Francis Hoare Symes,
was born on June 9, 1892, and
educated at “Mt. Carmel” College,
Charters Towers. From there, after
passing tho Junior University
Examination, he entered upon a
banking career, which occupied him
until 1915, when he returned to the
station and became engaged under
his father in pastoral work, being
taken into partnership by Mr.
Symes, Sen., in 1920, as already
mentioned. During the course of

descent, arrived in Australia about
a century ago, and thenceforward
played his part as a nation builder
in the vast Continent whose settle-

yond the south-eastern coastline.
He was one of the pioneers of the
Cranbourne district of Victoria,
where he spent very many years and
reared a large family to perpetuate
his line under the Southern Cross.

man followed in the original
pioneer’s footsteps and as an agrar-

a family consisting of a widowed
mother, two sons and a daughter

their advent to Australia in, or pre-
vious to, the seventies. One of Mrs.
Bell’s brothers, Thomas Lawless, was
a member of the Police Force and
distinguished himself in that capa-
city among those who were actively
engaged in the endeavour to capture
the desperate bushrangers compris-
ing the Kelly gang, notorious dur-
ing 1878-9 for a rapid succession of
murders and the magnitude and
daring character of their robberies.
Thomas Lawless was accredited with
being the best horseman in Australia
at that period, and his love of the

time of his death in the year 1903.
Shortly after his arrival in Queens-
land, now thirty-three years ago, the
present owner of “Cardigan”
accepted a post on that property and
gained his first experience of the
years. At the termination of that
period, in 1897, his wide experience
and ability resulted in the offer from
Mr. Buckland of the management of
“Cardigan.” This offer he accepted,
and for the following nineteen years
he was principally engaged in con

mentioned station, for brief periods
in the same interval carrying out
similar duties at “St. Ann’s” and

PATRICK SALMON, “Natal
Downs,’ Charters Towers, was born
at Ridgelands Diggings, near Rock-
hampton, Central Queensland, on
December 9, 1870, and is the eldest
son of the late Michael Salmon, who,
hailing from Lines, County Clare,
Ireland, in the early sixties, became
engaged in gold-mining in the dis-
trict outlying Rockhampton. Des-
cended from a family which had
been engaged in the work of primary
production for successive generations
dating from a period harking back
more than 200 years, Mr. Michael
Salmon proved a valuable citizen of
the young Colony then recently es-
tablished, the sturdiness of frame
begot of an outdoor life in the Old
World proving equal to the hard life
and fare of a pioneer of industry in
the land of his adoption. He fol-
lowed the quest of the red metal for
quite a considerable time, proceed-
ing from the district near Rock-
hampton to the Peak Downs copper
mines, and gaining in his peregrina-
tions valuable experience of the
geological conditions of the State,
but, from a remunerative point of
view, little more than a bare liveli-
hood. Finally deciding that his
capacity for hard work should be
productive of more satisfactory
results, he abandoned mining and
interested himself once more in the
calling to which he had been trained
in bojdiood, continuing to engage in
farming on the Peak Downs until the
that greatest of all bequests, an
honourable and unsullied name.
The late Michael Salmon married

name is a reminder to the student ot

tion and stirring tale of ancient
times in her native land, the branch
of the O’Neill family of which this
lady was a member having, like the
Salmons, been identified with farm-
ing pursuits in County Clare. Of the
union there is a family of three sons
a very early age indeed. Though
deprived of so much in the way ot
scholastic learning, he became an
excellent rider long before he was
ten, and his lack of book lore in
childhood he more than made up for
as a growing boy, when he seized
every opportunity of adding to hi;
store of knowledge, practising writ-
ing on the saddle flaps in the inter-
vals of riding after stock, or during
such other times as he could snatch
from the strenuous days of his early
career. His studious proclivities thus
early apparent became more pro-
nounced with advancing years, so that
Mr. Salmon may be said to have been
always a student and described as
exceptionally well informed on most
subjects of the day. When he was
ten he began life as a wage-earner in
the dairying industry, in which he
continued to be occupied in the
Copperfield district until the year
1886, when he left there and pro-
ceeded to the country watered by the
Suttor, where on “Eaglefield” Sta-
tion, he secured employment as a
station boy. He was at that time
fifteen years of age and continued to
work on "Eaglefield” until 1888,
gaining, during the two years spent
there, an excellent grounding in
stock work. When he left “Eagle-
field” he started upon a career as a
horse-breaker, finding ample employ-
ment in this very strenuous calling

districts until the year 1890, when

Though still under twenty years of
age, he carried out this undertaking
successfully; and on reaching man’s
estate was appointed to the manage-
ment of “Moorlands,” a property sit-
uated in the Barcoo district and
then held by the Murray-Prior
family. While at “Moorlands” he
combined the duties of management
with those of droving, safely deliver-
ing various mobs at their destina-
tions. His association with “Moor-
lands continued until the property
was sold, when he returned to the
district outlying Clermont whore he
again engaged in horsebreaking. At
this time he accepted the offer of the
management of “Glen Eva,” a
property on the Suttor River, and
thereafter, for a year, was occupied
with the duties incidental to the
post, which he varied with his then
favourite occupation of horsebreak-
ing. He left “Glen Eva” to join the
rush to McDonald’s Flat, the scene
of a newly discovered goldfield in
the Clermont district. However,
after bottoming on a couple of
duffers, he became imbued with the
conviction that Fortune was not

efforts in the mining industry, and

handled and rode until they were

of the same year he first became
connected with “Natal Downs,” then

outstation. He held the manage-
ment of “Peegurrima” for two years,

in Southern Queensland, Mr. Thomas

very short period only on the station

a brief period in the latter country
and in Ceylon. From Ceylon they
proceeded to Egypt and Palestine,
thence to Italy, their itinerary tak-
ing in Switzerland, Austria, Ger-

being included in the return journey.
They protracted their stay in the
various countries longer than is
usually the custom of tourists, and
visited the places most noted in
Eastern and Western history—an-
cient and modern—spending a
particularly lengthy period in the
British. Isles. Throughout the two
years he was absent from his native
land, Mr. Salmon jotted down all
items of interest; and of his impres-
sions he has made a most interesting
record and one that speaks eloquently
of his exceptional powers of observa-
tion. At home, as president of the
Towers Pastoral, Industrial and
Mining Association, and a member of
the Pastoral Employers’ Association,
he has played an important part in
connection with the industrial pro-
gress of the district in which his in-
terests are centred. He is a com-
mitteeman and vice-president of the
Charters Towers Civic Club ; and as a
committeeman of the Towers Jockey
Club, he has been prominent in
Northern racing circles for a great
number of years, and among those
whose efforts have accomplished
much towards establishing a clean
standard in the sporting life of the
locality. Throughout his long pas-
toral career he has displayed a keen
knowledge and appreciation of a good
horse, and on taking charge of
“Natal Downs” was particularly in
his element in this respect, at once
making it an important side issue of
the operations conducted on the
station to keep up the high standard
of breeding instituted by the Messrs.
Bundock Bros., who had achieved for
“Natal Downs” a name second to
none in the North for the quality of
its horseflesh. Among the sires
used during recent years were "Peter
the Painter,” “Blue Book,” and
others of equal quality. With stock
of his own breeding Mr. Salmon has
been very successful on the Northern
Queensland turf, his colours, all tar-
tan, frequently catching the judge’s
eye in important events, including
the Central Queensland Derby
and North Queensland Guineas,
1922. In the year 1896, he married
Maria Jane, daughter of Mr. George
Butler of “Fanning River” Station,
a well-known pioneer of Queensland
who has been associated in pastoral
enterprise with the Murray-Prior
family for about half a century.
Mrs. Salmon, like her husband, has
been associated with the bush from
childhood. Throughout the many
vicissitudes of the latter’s career she
proved herself a helpmeet in the best
sense of the word, and received from
her husband full credit for the part
she has played in his eminently suc-
cessful career. “Natal Downs” was
originally taken up by Messrs. Keller
and Spry, who sold it in the year
1869 to Messrs. Chatfield, Miles &
Co., from whom it passed by sale to
Messrs. Bundock & Hayes. As
already stated Mr. Salmon became
associated in partnership with the
Messrs. Bundock Bros, in the year
1904. The property with its out-
station, which, prior to the days of
Government resumptions, aggregated
a square mileage of 1,000, now
comprises about 400 square miles of
downs and forest country which is
watered by the Cape River, Natal,
Amelia and Capsize Creeks, and
various lagoons. Pure shorthorns
compose the herd, which was founded
in the Messrs. Bundock’s time, and
has since been kept up to the high
standard set by them by the intro-
duction of bulls from the best South-
ern studs. During recent years, a
stud was inaugurated by Mr. Salmon
on Natal Downs,” and this already
gives promise of holding its own
among similar concerns in the North.
The Natal Downs’ homestead which
is one of the most modern, comfort-
able and conveniently appointed of
Northern Queensland, occupies a site
distant 100 miles from Charters
Towers. It was erected under Mr.

which served during his early associa-

pierced with rifle holes as a means of

days when they were numerous and
hostile in the locality. Mr. Salmon

MYLES LYONS, “Wombiana”
Station, in the Charters Towers dis-
trict. Born at Corduff, near Drum-
keerim, County Leitrim, Ireland, on
July 26, 1865, the subject of this
MR. M. LYONS.
memoir is the youngest son and
namesake of the late Myles Lyons,
and a descendant of a family whose
origin dates back to a very early
period in the history of his native
country. For centuries the Lyons
held their own lands and were pro-
minently known among the people
of Connaught, though for many
generations a branch of the family
has been settled in County Cavan
in ownership of farming lands.
Though recorded in association with
some of the most stirring incidents
in old Irish history, they have taken
little part in national politics since
'the seventeenth century. The founder
of the family under the Southern
Cross was James Lyons, the eldest
brother of Mr. Myles Lyons, of
“Wombiana.” That gentleman came
to Queensland nearly sixty years ago,
and after gaining considerable know-
ledge of the geological conditions of
his adopted country at the Gympie,
Palmer, Hodgkinson, Charters
Towers, and other goldfields,
settled at Cairns, Northern Queens-
land. He occupied several public
positions in Cairns, including the
mayoralty of the town; and for a
number of years he represented the
electorate as a member of the Legis-
lative Assembly. The advent of
James was followed by that of his
two brothers, Francis and Arthur,
and, later, of Mr. Myles Lyons, who
arrived from the Homeland in the
year 1883. Educated at a National
school in his native county, Mr.
Myles Lyons concluded the voyage
from the Old World at Mackay,
Northern Queensland, and from
there secured a position on a sugar
plantation. Twelve months later he
took up a selection which he was
forced to abandon owing to ill-health.
After a brief period spent in the
Mackay district he proceeded to
Cairns to visit his brother. He left
Cairns to take the position of book-
keeper in the butchering business of
the late Maurice Quinn at Ravens-
wood Junction, with whom he got
a good insight to the trade apart
from his clerical duties. He decided
to put his experience to practical use
MR. F. P. LYONS.
when the Northern railway was ex-
tended and caused an impetus to
settlement by purchasing the business
from Mr. Quinn in conjunction with
Mr. P. Dowd. However, the railway
construction was followed by the
establishment of other butchering
concerns which were able to offer
strong opposition to the enterprise
of these young men who, after a year,
closed their business and dissolved
partnership. Turning his hand to
mining on the Ravenswood field, Mr.
Lyons thenceforward had a very
varied career, taking such work as
came his way, and determined that
by grit and perseverance he would
again achieve the wherewithal to
make a definite step in the direction
of success. Towards the end of the
eighties, in partnership with the late
Robert Patterson, he again essayed
an independent venture which was to
prove his first successful start in his
adopted country, this being the
acquirement of a butchering busi-
ness, which he carried on at the con-
struction works of the Bowen railway
until the completion of the Govern-
ment operations in the locality, when
the partnership with Mr. Patterson
was mutually dissolved. He pur-
chased a business at Homestead,
near Charters Towers, in the early
nineties, but disposed of it when
payable gold was discovered at the
Golden Valley in the vicinity of
Croydon, as he was of the opinion
that the district would receive an
impetus likely to add considerably
to its importance and to the possi-
bilities of trade. On arrival at these
diggings, however, he decided that
the prosperity of the place was not
such as to tempt investment, and
therefore he returned to Charters
Towers district, where he repur-
chased the Homestead business and
conducted it until the year 1912,
when he sold to Mr. John Piper,
who had been his trusted and confi-
dential employe for a quarter of a
century. During the period he had
carried on his butchering business at
Homestead he launched into trade
in another direction, becoming

Lyons purchased “Barrington” Sta-

year 1913 “Braceborough” was sold

leisure in his hitherto energetic
career, and has, therefore, taken
practically no part in affairs of public
import. He married at Charters
Towers in the year 1897 Julia,
daughter of the late John Courteuy,
who was a member of a County
Kerry farming family which origin-
ated in Ireland in the days of which
we know little beyond what has been
handed down by tradition. Of his
family, five sons and five daughters
survive, all of whom were born in
Northern Queensland. Francis
Patrick Lyons, the eldest son, whose
birth occurred in the year 1901, was
educated at Mount Carmel and St.
Patrick’s Colleges of Charters Towers,
Queensland, and Goulburn, New
South Wales, respectively. From the
latter school he entered the Hawkes-
bury Agricultural College, and on
the completion of his training there
the adjoining property, “Glen-

to the pastoral interests of the firm,

the late Albert William Duckett

Hon. William Duckett White,
M.L.C., who, coming from West-
meath in Ireland, arrived in Queens-
land with his wife in the year 1847,
MR. A. W. D. WHITE.
and settled in the Logan District,
where he entered upon the manage-
ment of “Beaudesert” Station,
which afterwards passed into his
hands. The late Hon. W. D. Whit©
continued to live at “Beaudesert”
until the year 1866, having before
that date acquired other pastoral in-
terests in Southern Queensland.
From 1866 until the time of his
death in 1903, he lived at “Lota,”
a beautiful home which, situated at
Manly and overlooking Moreton Bay,
had been built by him in the sixties.
For a number of years he was a
member of the Queensland Legis-
lative Council; and he was one of
the first men approached by Gov-
ernor Bowen when forming the
original Parliament of Queensland
when the present State was newly
established as a Colony. At the time
he declined Governor Bowen's offer,
though soon afterwards he took h:s
seat. Among the properties which
he owned in addition to “Beau-
dessrt,” were “Nindooinbah” and
“Bluff Downs.” His eldest son,
the late Ernest White, subsequently
acquired “Nindooinbah,” and
Albert White became the owner of
“Bluff Downs,” which he personally
administered until his death in
1914, when it passed into the hands
of the present owner, Mr. E. E. D.
White. The Hon. W. 1). White’s
other child, Helena, became the
wife of Captain Graham Mylne, a
Queensland pioneer of the fifties,
who arrived in the same vessel that
brought to the Colony its first
Governor, Sir George Bowen, and
afterwards lived at “Etonville” on
the Clarence River, New South
Wales. Captain Mylne’s son, Mr.
G. E. Mylne, now resides at “Lota.”
The late Albert White entered upon
the management of “Bluff Downs”
in 1873, the year when, in partner-
ship with his father, he took up this
property, which was originally
formed in the early sixties by the
late William Hann, whose explora-
tory achievements are recorded in
Vol. 11. of this wwk. Mr. Hann
stocked “Bluff Downs” with sheep,
but the country, which is of rough
basalt formation, proved so unsuit-
able for this class of stock that it
was abandoned for a few years.
Albert White introduced shorthorn
cattle which were overlanded from
“Beaudesert” on the Logan River,
Southern Queensland. In the late
sixties the Mitchell grass plains of
the North-west attracted him, and
taking with him two horses (one a
pack horse) he travelled west on to
the head of the Flinders River and
formed “Beaudesert” Station, which
he named after his old “Beaudesert”
home on the Logan. Later, in part-
nership with the Collins family, of
the Logan district, he formed the
firm of Collins, White & Co. ly

style, is well fitted in the way of
modern conveniences. It is situated
on a high ridge on the bank of the
Basalt River, a tributary of the
Burdekin, and overlooks a succession
of large permanent waterholes
separated by rocky waterfalls. River
oak trees line the watercourse.
“Bluff Downs” and the other hold-
ings managed in conjunction with it,
aggregate about 1,000 square miles of
Crown Leasehold country, and runs
an average of 20,000 cattle. This
country lies chiefly on basalt table-
land and consists of light timbered,
undulating black soil plains, alter-
nating with stony, red soil ridges.
It is rich in limestone, which renders
it particularly suitable for grazing
sound horses. Stocked in 1873 with
shorthorn cattle from “Beaudeseit
on the Logan, a few Devon bulls
were introduced on trial during the
drought in 1875, with such satisfac-
tory results as to cause their contin-
ued use. It was early realized, es-
pecially after the droughts of 1885
and 1888, that pure-bred_ shorthorns
are unsuitable for this district.
There are few, if any, herds on the
Burdekin Tableland to-day in which
a cross has not been used to increase
general hardiness and constitution.
From the outset, the Devon Short-
horn cross on “Bluff Downs” produced
a strain particularly adapted to the
rough nature of the country and one
that has proved itself to a con-
siderable degree able to withstand
the droughts, which, unfortunately
periodically recur in Queensland.
Mr. White has had such faith
in the Devon breed, that in the year
1902, he started a stud of pure-
breds, purchasing for the purpose
eighty heifers from the herds of Mr.
Mitchell, “Tabletop,” Victoria, and
Mr. H. Brooks, Warwick, Queens-
land. This stud has since been
maintained by continued importa-
tion from England and the South-
ern States. Eight sires have been
imported from England during the
last fourteen years. It will be
seen that both the late A. W. D.
White and his son have devoted a
considerable amount of study to the
subject of breeding cattle suitable
for their district and Northern
Queensland generally. Their efforts
and experiments have evolved a
type which for many years has been
recognized as ideal for the freezing
and export trade, combining excel-
lent, even quality and good weight.
The bullocks at four years old aver-
age about 700 lbs dressed at the
meat works. In addition, their
hardiness renders them eminently
fitted to stand the dry seasons and
the long distances that have to be
travelled to find grass and water.
Besides the Devons, Mr. White keeps
a herd of shorthorns at “Toomba.”
The practice for many years has been
to keep a pure-bred herd of both

JAMES ROLLINSON, “Allan-

northern part of the Queen State.
Robert Rollinson arrived at the site
of Charters Towers almost simult-
aneously with the discovery of gold
on that field, being among those
vigorous pioneers who followed the
lure of Dame Fortune at earlier
gold-mining centres. He came to the
Charters Towers field from Gympie,
his advent in Australia dating con-
siderably more than half a century
back. Though a descendant of a
family which had always been iden-
tified with agriculture in the Old
World, he was trained to the black-
smithing trade, which, in the land of
his adoption, provided him with
ample employment. This avocation
proved a surer stepping-stone than
did the mining industry to his later
pastoral investment, and he con-
tinued to employ himself as a
blacksmith for some years, having
amassed by the early eighties suffi-
cient capital to make an independent
start on a block of land on Balfe
Creek, near Charters lowers. This
property he named “Braceborough,
after his birthplace in England, and
a few years after its acquirement
went into occupation there with his
young family. “Braceborough” con-
tinued to be his home until his death
in 1898, which deprived the district
of one of its most worthy pioneers.
He was prominently associated with
the Masonic and Oddfellows frater-
nities, and throughout the period of
his long association with the industry
he was well and popularly known
among his fellow-pastoralists and
others with whom he came in contact,
for he was ever ready to lend a help-
ing hand whenever and wherever
needed and proved a good neighbour
in all senses of the word. He was
survived by a family of three sons
and three daughters. Mr. James
Rollinson, of “Allandale,” was
educated at the Central School,
Charters Towers, concluding his
studies there when in his early teens
to assume his share of the work on
the home acres, particularly in the
dairying and grazing operations con-
ducted by his father. Being desirous
MR. J. ROLLINSON.
at that time of following a town
trade, it was not long before he
relinquished his connection with the
land to take a position with the late
D. Kennedy, then the proprietor of
a saddlery business in Charters
Towers, and by whom he continued
to be employed for five years. The
restricted experience afforded by this
work, which, however, was to prove
exceedingly useful in his later career
on the land, caused him to relinquish
his post with Mr. Kennedy and seek
other avocation. This he found in a
mill in the district. After a time,
realizing that the life to which he
had been accustomed from childhood
held for him the most promising
possibilities, he decided to again
enter the pastoral industry, and the
period immediately preceding his
attainment to man’s estate found
him again at “Braceborough” and
engaged in the developmental and
stock operations there inaugurated
by the pioneer. Shortly after his
return to the old station the death of
the founder of the family occurred
and the management of “Brace-
borough” devolved upon the subject
of our memoir, who, owing to various
adverse circumstances in the in-
dustry, found himself faced witli
very difficult times. Nevertheless,
he and his brother Arthur managed
to finance the purchase of the in-
terests held by the other members
of the family, and, as partners,
endeavoured to avert the disaster
threatened by the drought visitation
of 1900-3 and the tick pest. They
purchased “Trafalgar,” an adjoin-
ing property, in the year 1902 with
the object of saving the stock on
“Braceborough,” which was being
rapidly denuded of feed and water
owing to the continuance of drought
conditions. Their action saved the
herd until the prolongation of the
drought had its effect on “Trafalgar”
also, necessitating the removal of the
stock elsewhere. Country rented on
agistment was found for them in the
neighbourhood of Ingham, further
north, and here, accordingly, they

were taken and depastured; but
despite all their efforts the terrible
visitation, assisted by the spread of
the tick pest, claimed as its toll
1,284 out of the herd of 1,350 which
they had travelled from “Trafalgar,”


only 66 being returned to their
original pastures. In the face of
such adversities has the great in-
dustry been built up, and it is to
men of the calibre of Mr. Rollinson
that the State owes much of its
prosperity. Being determined to
carry on in spite of obstacles, he
purchased his brother’s interest in
“Braceborough” and “Trafalgar”
in the year 1904, and to meet the
financial strain sold the former pro-
perty to Mr. Myles Lyons. As grist
to the mill, and to tide over this try-
ing crisis in his affairs, he entered the
butchering business at Lyontown, a
mining field lying 30 miles from
Charters Towers, which had been
established about that time. He held
this business until the year 1913,
gaining the goodwill and respect of
the residents of the township during
his nine years’ sojourn amongst them
as well as of the neighbouring pas-
toralists, who, with the townspeople,
combined to present Mr. and Mrs.
Rollinson with an address and a
testimonial in the shape of a gold
watch for himself and jewellery for
his wife, as an expression of their
appreciation of those kindly and
public-spirited qualities which dis-
tinguished both, and of their regret

time of the Great War, in which he

ties. He therefore returned to the

hailed from Coathill, County Cavan,
Ireland, where he was born in the
year 1842. He came to Queensland
in 1863 and entered into business
pursuits at Lilydale, where he con-
tinued until 1866, in which year he
proceeded to the Cape River gold-
fields, afterwards proceeding to
Townsville. He was one of the
earliest arrivals at the Ravenswood
diggings, where he erected a crushing
plant, which he subsquently removed
to Charters Towers. At this centre,
in 1877, he established an iron
foundry, which he carried on for
some years. In 1879 be was member
for Townsville, but resigned his seat
in favour of Mr. Macrossan. Mr.
Deane next turned his attention to
the pastoral industry, purchasing
“Bluff” Station, near Birdsville,
Western Queensland. He was called
to the Legislative Council in August,
1889. A most public-spirited man,
his career in Northern Queensland
was marked by his prominence in all
movements of importance affecting
the advancement of that part of the
State. He was an enthusiastic
advocate for territorial separation
with Townsville as the capital of the
North, and up to the time of his
death was Government Representa-
tive and nominee on the Townsville
Board. For many years he was a
councillor of the Dalrymple Shire,
holding municipal honours while
resident at Charters Towers. He was
the founder of the Burdekin Meat
Preserving Co., in which he held a
partnership for seventeen years,
being engaged in the management of
the works until 1912, when he dis-
posed of his interests and retired into
private life. His death, which
occurred on October 25, 1913, was
regretted by a wide circle of friends
to whom he was endeared, not only
for his efforts in regard to charitable
and other institutions, which earned
for him the reputation of a public
benefactor, but for his many private
qualities, which prompted him to
render such service as was in his
power to the individual as well as the
community. His wife, nee Mary
Gologhley, came of very ancient
Irish stock, her progenitors having
followed agrarian pursuits in the Old
Land during many succeeding gen-
erations. Mr. Andrew Deane was
educated at Townsville. Putting his
school days behind him at an early
age, he immediately entered the
industry to which he has since
devoted himself, gaining experience
of cattle raising and the many details
connected therewith on "‘Bluff”
Station, then owned by his father,
where he was occupied in various
capacities for a period of seventeen
years. Subsequently he was appointed
as buying agent for the Burdekin
Meat Preserving Co., his time
being for some years thereafter
divided between the duties of that
position, which engaged his energies
in the buying season, and his work
on the station. Eventually, in the
year 1909, he took up "Woura
Park,” acquiring also an interest in
an adjoining property called “Woga-
doona.” “Woura Park,” which is
situated in the vicinity of Torrens
Creek, was formerly a part of
“Lammermoor” and "Oakley”

being the centre from and to which
his loading is conveyed. Mr. Deane
is a supporter of clean sport in all its
forms, and is connected with the

Archer was born in the year 1825
and was the fourth son of Edward
Archer, who lived from 1792 to 1834.
Educated at Winchester and Oxford,
end of which, in 1866, he sailed for
New Zealand. Settling in Timaru,
South Canterbury, he purchased land
and erected a home, which he named
“Trelaske,” after tlm old family seat
in England. In Timaru he founded


the mercantile firm of Miles, Archer
and Co., which became well known
in connection with the early develop-
ment of that part of the young
colony. He was prominently iden-
tified with the business life of
Timaru for many years, but in the
early nineties his interests were
by all with whom he came in contact.
During the thirty-five years of his
life in New Zealand he identified
himself with all the progressive
movements that marked the growth
of the now populous Dominion.

in the High Schools of Timaru and

gravely affected by the financial
depression which was so severely felt
at that time, and in consequence
he proceeded to Christchurch, where
he was ao-ain occupied with com-
mercial interests for a period.
Eventually he returned to the land
of his forbears, spending the autumn
of his days at Paignton, Devonshire,
where he died in his eighty-first year,
Christchurch, and matriculated from
the latter. Subsequently, deciding to
enter commercial life, he joined the
staff of the Bank of Australasia in
Christchurch, remaining in the service
until convinced that the possibilities
of future independence were more
promising on the land. Prompted by
this conviction, he resigned his posi-
tion in the bank and became a cadet
one of a prospecting party, he started
out on a journey to Rhodesia and
became engaged in working on the
mineral areas surrounding Bulawayo,
where his labours met the failure
and disappointment which so o ten
attend similar expeditions. Proceed-
ing to Pretoria he joined the Civil
Service of the Transvaal, entering

in the pastoral industry at “Hay-

there for two years, the end of
which period witnessed the outbreak
of the Boer War. Realizing the need
of the Empire he immediately offered
his services in her cause, becoming in
due course a member of the Cape
resigning to take up a block
of country on the Government
Settlement at Warmbaths. He
was occupied with the develop-
ment of this property for two
years, but being forced to relinquish
it at the end of that period through
want of sufficient capital to tide him


over a succession of dry seasons, he
eventually returned to New Zealand.
Shortly after his arrival news of the
Zulu Rebellion reached the Dominion
and resulted in his again volunteer-
ing for military service in Africa;
and during his period of service he
was a member of Royston’s Horse.
On the declaration of peace he again
set out for New Zealand, and shortly
after lauding purchased a grazing
property in South Canterbury, to
the development, of which he
applied his energies for about two
years. Finding his operations
retarded for lack of space he
disposed of this area and set his face
towards the wider territory of
Queensland. On his advent thereto
he spent some time in inspect-
ing different properties, becoming
familiar meanwhile with the condi-
tions characterizing a new country
wherein he was disposed to settle.
Eventually, in the year 1910, he
purchased his present holding,
“Holmleigh,” which was formerly
known as “Family Home,” a
property of some 40,000 acres and
originally portion of old “Lammer-
moor” Station. The whole area
is subdivided into ten paddocks
of varying sizes, in accordance
with the requirements and most
convenient handling of the stock
occupying them, which are plentifully
supplied with natural and artificial
water, Tower Hill and Kerr Creeks
flowing through the area, while a
supplemental source is afforded by
large dams which contain a plentiful
supply in most seasons. With the
object of guarding against the visita-
tion of drought he is devoting further
attention to the artificial production
of this most important factor in
pastoral operations. At the time
of writing the pastures are
grazed with merino sheep of local
origin, though, owing to the increas-
ing trouble experienced through the
depredations of the dingoes in recent
years, the owner is gradually
disposing of the sheep and stocking
up with shorthorn cattle. Horses in
sufficient numbers for station require-
ments are bred on the property. The
homestead is situated at a distance
of 250 miles from Townsville and 50
miles south of Prairie, which is the
nearest railway and postal centre and
with which it is connected by
telephone. The dwelling has been
considerably extended and improved
since the advent of Mr. Archer,
whose efforts have resulted in the
accomplishment of those details of
comfort and convenience which so
materially mitigate adverse climatic
conditions and obviate the many
other drawbacks so often accompany-
ing pastoral life. The grounds in
the near vicinity of the house have
been formed into garden plots, while

late John Surgeon hailed originally
from Cumberland, where for many
ages successive generations of the line
were engaged in agricultural pursuits,
several of the name being yet
resident in that part of the Mother-
land and regarded with esteem in the
communities of which they form a
part. Born in the early forties, he
left England when quite a boy,
actuated by that love of adventure
which prompted so many of our
pioneers to exchange the more settled
environment of an earlier civilization
for the vividly imagined attractions
of a country containing wonderful
possibilities for those sufficiently
endowed with the physical, mental,
and moral qualities to successfully
overcome the primitive forces against
which only the fittest might survive,

Zealand in the late fifties. Here he
followed the lure of the yellow metal
with little success and consequently
drifted to the mainland, continuing
his prospecting career at different
Victorian centres of alluvial fame
when the gold fever was at its zenith.
Subsequently he travelled to the far
North and was amongst the earliest
prospectors on the Palmer, and later,
on the Peak diggings, where he was
engaged until the sensational dis-
coveries at the centre now known as
Charters Towers caused him to
venture his luck on the diggings,
which later begot the prosperous
town so named. After a period spent
in mining on the Charters Towers
field he decided that a surer road to
success lay in the direction of
commerce, a realization that took
shape in a butchering business which
he opened in the centre of the
settlement on a site now included in

being both level-headed and indus-

business, it was not long before he
found himself in a solvent position.


He later admitted Mr. Cowan as a
partner in the proposition, the con-
nection continuing for a brief period
only, Mr. Surgeon realizing that
greater success attended his efforts
when conducted independently and
according to his own methods. From

of their butchering interests, the
business which continued to be the
leading establishment of its kind in
Charters Towers, was conducted
under the title of John Surgeon & Co.
In the year 1892 Mr. Surgeon entered
the pastoral industry, securing by
purchase that historical old property
known as “Burdekin Downs,” which
is reputed to be one of the oldest
stations in Northern Queensland.
Later he purchased “Fanning River”
and “Wambiana” Stations, which
he ran as cattle and horse proposi-
tions, personally conducting these
and his other interests until the time
of bis death which occurred in the
year 1910. His fine attributes of
citizenship prompted him to actively
identify himself with the various
institutions inaugurated for the
advancement of Charters Towers and
its outlying district, throughout
which portion of the State his
influence was strongly felt despite
the claims made on his time by the
multiplicity of his private affairs.
For a considerable number of years
he was chairman of the Dalrymple
Shire Council, and he was also
prominently connected with the
Masonic craft. The late Mr.
Surgeon married Harriet, daughter
of Mr. James Brown, who came from
"WOODBINE" HOMESTEAD AND OUTBUILDINGS.
Of the union there was born a family
of three sons and one daughter, the
latter being Mrs. Frank Manton,
who at time of writing resides in
Sydney. The three sons, John
Brown, Nathan, and James Robert,
were all born at Charters Towers and
primarily educated there, later
attending that well-known scholastic
institution Wesley College, Mel-
bourne, Victoria. On the death of

became joint administrators of his
estate, the actual management of
affairs being entrusted to the eldest,
Mr. John Brown Surgeon. The
affairs of the estate eventually being
settled, the last-named gentleman
purchased “Burdekin Downs” and
proposition in the Winton district in
which James Robert was also
interested. This property was sold
by the partners four years later. Mr.
J. B. Surgeon now lives in Sydney
where he has large commercial
interests. He is part-owner with his
brother, Nathan, in “Woodbine”
and “Ashbrook,” two grazing pro-
perties near Prairie, and also has
interests in the State of Victoria. He
married in the year 1912 Minnie
Elizabeth Topping, and of the union
there is a family of two sons. Mr.
Nathan Surgeon was born on Feb-
ruary 24, 1892, and shortly after
the completion of his scholastic
education became a jackaroo on
Marathon ’ ’ Station, near Richmond,


on which property he equipped
himself with a thorough knowledge
of that branch of the grazing indus-
try which embraces the management
of woolly stock. He remained at
“Marathon ’ until the purchase of

of a charitable, patriotic, or social
nature. He is a keen advocate of

of cricket, excelled in all its branches
as followed by the public schoolboy
of the day during the seven years of
his career at Wesley College, winning
honour for his Alma Mater and
gaining laurels for himself in the
shape of trophies, etc. He is a
member of the various amateur rac-
ing bodies of Northern Queensland,
and of the Flinders Club, Hughen-
den, and the Civic Club, Charters
Towers. He married in the year
1916 Irene Madeline, daughter of
the late Horace Brown, who will be
well remembered by the older
residents of Aramac and Rock-
hampton, as one of the identities of
the districts outlying these towns.
The late gentleman was a brother of
Mr. Arthur Raymond Brown (also
deceased), whose career is described
in an article dealing with the life of
his son-in-law, Mr. A. D. Alexander,
of "Willoughby.” Though of Vic-
torian birth Mr. Horace Brown spent
more than half his life in Queens-
land. He was one of the pioneers of
the sugar-growing industry at
Mackay, subsequently residing at
Aramac, where he was engaged in
commercial pursuits for many years.
He later removed to the Port Curtis
district and was occupied with
agrarian interests on a property in
the vicinity of Rockhampton at the
time of his death. His family con-
sisted of two sons and five daughters.
Mr. Nathan Surgeon has a family of
one son and one daughter. Mr.
James Robert Surgeon, the youngest
son of the late pioneer was interested
in the earlier pastoral ventures of his
brothers as already stated, but when
the demand for men to assist in the
Great War which devastated Europe
in the years 1914-18 became urgent,
he elected to dedicate his life and
service to his country, making one
more unit in fhe great army of loyal
Australians who fought for liberty
and honour in the Empire’s cause.
Donning the khaki in 1916, he sailed
from the land which held for him the
present comforts and future hopes
attendant upon a promising pastoral
career, and served through the cam-
paigns of Egypt and Turkey until
the advent of peace.

died in Northamptonshire, being
most numerously associated with
that part of the County surrounding
the village of Yelvertoft, where the
late gentleman was born in 1844.
He was a son of the late Francis
Rollston, who during his lifetime was
engaged in the agricultural industry
in his native County. Having an
enterprising temperament, Mr.
David Rollston, while still in his
teens, resolved to exercise his
energies in a country where the
chances of success appeared
propitious, though its attainment
might be accompanied by
unaccustomed hardships, and having
paid much attention to the stories
of the wonderful gold finds in
Australia during the fifties and
sixties, decided to shape his career in
the Island Continent. Making the
then infant Colony of Queensland his
objective, he accordingly set sail and
in due course arrived at his
destination, proceeding to the
Darling Downs, where he became
engaged in farming work, meanwhile
taking his bearings in the land of his
adoption. As soon as he was in a
position to personally investigate the
possibilities of the mining industry
he went to Gympie, and buoyed by
the hope of ultimate success put his
whole heart into the calling to which
he meant to devote himself, working
at that and other gold-bearing
centres with such determined
energy that before many years had
passed he was thoroughly familiar
with not only the practical but the
scientific and theoretical sides of the
industry. The year 1872 witnessed
his arrival at Charters Towers.
Here, after a time spent in
prospecting, he worked different
mines on his own account, his efforts
then meeting with but indifferent
success. Subsequently he became
manager of the “No. 4 North
Australian,” “The Mary,” and other
mines. With the Millett Bros, and
others he was one of the early
shareholders in the “Wellington,”
and was occupied in connection
therewith when he accepted the
appointment of mine manager of the
Day Dawn Block and Wyndham, at
the Block shaft, taking over his
duties at about the time the reef was
struck, his first crushings returning
5 ozs. to the ton. He continued to
carry out the duties of the above
position for some years, at the
termination of which, his ability
received further recognition by his
appointment as general manager of
the company which owned the
venture. In the year 1888 he
supervised the erection of the
company’s crushing mill at Selheim,
on the Burdekin River, and
controlled the operations of that
department of the enterprise in
conjunction with his earlier duties,
being thus occupied until 1902,
when he tendered his resignation,
though his connection with other
mining ventures remained unbroken.
On retiring from the position which
he had so long and ably filled he was
presented by his staffs with
illuminated addresses which fittingly
paid tribute to his many fine
characteristics. He later acquired
the business of Messrs. A. B. Bright
6 Co., which he carried on for a
period. In 1910 he purchased
‘ Ewen Plains,” a pastoral
proposition which has since been
managed by his youngest son.
During his career in the North he
was on the directorate of many of
the leading mining companies at
Charters Towers, by whom his advice
and experience were regarded as
valuable assets. In all matters
pertaining to the advancement of
the industry or of the district
generally he was prominently to the


fore. On two occasions he occupied
the mayoral chair of the town, and
for a number of years held
aldermanic honours. In the year
1912 he crossed the Great Divide

come in contact during his long and
useful career in Northern Queens-
land. Percy Rollston, his youngest
son, was born at Charters Towers, on
May 1, 1866. He was educated
primarily at Charters Towers and
later attended the Campbelltown
Grammar School, New South Wales,
where he remained for three years,
completing his collegiate course at
Newington College, Sydney, when
in his eighteenth year. Returning
to Queensland he joined the staff of
the Bank of Australasia in order to
gain a knowledge of finance,
subsequently entering the office of
Mr. Alan B. Bright, where he
received a commercial training.
With the view of receiving a
thorough equipment in pastoral
knowledge he entered as a student
at Gatton College, near Brisbane,
whence, after a course of two years
which combined the practical and
theoretical sides of the industry, he
returned to the North and
undertook stock duties for his father
on a property near Ravenswood
known as “Grass Hut,” in which the
latter had interests. Here he
remained until the purchase of
“Ewen Plains,” when, transferring
the “Grass Hut” stock to that
property, he undertook the work of
administration, initiating an
up-to-date and extensive system of
development on the area which has
ee2
been faithfully adhered to with the
result that at time of writing
it ranks among the most highly-
improved propositions in the
northern portion of the State.
“Ewen Plains” came into the
possession of Messrs. Francis,
Robert, and Percy Rollston on the
death of Mr. D. Rollston, but when
Robert volunteered for service at the
front during the war of 1914-18 he
disposed of his share to his elder and
younger brothers, the management
and administration of the run and
“Coton Vale,” a holding later
selected by the firm, remaining in the
capable hands of the latter, whose
training specially fitted him for the
work. Mr. P. Rollston is a member
of the Civic Club, Charters Towers,
and the Flinders Club, JTughenden.
He is a supporter of all forms of
clean sport, more particularly
associated with the local amateur
race clubs. The pastoral and
agricultural societies of the district
have his ready co-operation, and he
is a member of the United
Pastoralists’ and Grazing Farmers’
Association. Mr. P. Rollston
married in the year 1913 Nano
Lilian, daughter of the late John
Justin MchTamus. a native of New
Zealand of Irish descent, his forbears
having handed down to him a name
which, from ages now lost in
obscurity, has been closely associated
with the historv of the Emerald Isle.
The late Mr. McNamus was a well-
known Government contractor and
was engaged in connection with the
construction of the railways and
tramways of New South Wales,
being employed in his calling up to
the time of his death. Of the uninn
there is one son and one daughter.
Mr. Francis Rollston, the eldest
living son of the late David Rollston,
was born at Charters Towers on June
26, 1879. Receiving his education
in his native town he concluded his
studies when at the age of fifteen,
and subsequently went through the
different phases of practical training
under his late father’s supervision,
remaining thus occupied for about
four years. In the year 1899, in
order to gain a wider experience of
the industry in which he was directly
interested, and incidentally of the
varying conditions prevailing in the
land of his birth, he journeyed to
Western Australia, engaging in
mining avocations in and around
Kalgoorlie and Boulder, his work
being chiefly in the form of
contracts. After remaining in the
West for about three years he
returned to Charters Towers and
continued his mining career, in the
course of which he filled the posts of
shift manager in both the Mills
United and the Brilliant Central
Mines. On becoming part owner of
“Ewen Plains” through the death of
Mr. David Rollston, he withdrew
from the practical pursuit of the
industry, though still retaining his
interests therein, and turned his
attention to the land, taking up
“Coton Vale” in conjunction with
his brothers in order to expand the
scope of the firm’s pastoral
operations. He now divides his
time between his home at Charters
Towers and “Ewen Plains.” A
prominent figure in connection with
the various progressive movements
that have marked the advancement
of Northern Queensland, he has also
held municipal honours and occupied
the directorship of several mining
companies. He is a member of the
Civic Club and of the Charters
Towers Jockey Club. In the year
1917 he married Hannah, daughter
of the late Robert Stephenson, who
for many years was associated with
the life of Charters Towers, being
particularly well and favourably
known among the old mining
population of that town. Of the

union there is one son. Mr. Robert

Campbelltown Grammar School,
New South Wales, returning to the
parental roof tree on his attainment
to the age of seventeen, when he
obtained a position in the timber
department of the Day Dawn Block
and Wyndham Mines under his
father’s supervision. At the
termination of four years he
relinquished the duties incidental
to this post in order to join the staff
of the Venus Stone Crushing Mill
at Milchester with the view of
becoming familiar with the milling
branch of the mining industry, and
was thus occupied until 1910, when
he accompanied his parents and
sisters on a trip to England. In the
early part of the year 1911, turning
his attention to pastoral pursuits, he
joined his brother, Mr. Percy
Rollston, on “Ewen Plains,” and
was engaged in assisting the latter
in the conduct of that proposition
until the realization of the Empire’s
need caused him to volunteer for
service in the Great World War
which wrought such havoc in Europe
during the years 1914-18. Joining
the colours in 1916, the month of
January of the following year
witnessed his e barkation by the
troopship “Ayrshire” for England.
Shortly after his arrival he was sent
to the Belgian front, and was
subsequently engaged in the fighting
at Messines, Wychatte, Hamel, and
in the famous battle on August 8,
1918, which occurred at Villers
Bretonneux and added to the
immortal fame of the Australian
Army. On September 5, 1918, he
was severely wounded at Peronne
and consequently invalided to
England and later to Australia, in
due course receiving his discharge,
the nature of his wound rendering
him unfit for further military
service. “Ewen Plains” was
formerly included in the area of
“Lammermoor” Station, and was
originally selected by Mr. J. V.
Kirby when a portion of that
historical old property was resumed
for purposes of closer settlement.
It embraces some 48,000 acres which
include both open plains and forest
country, the latter carrying a heavy
growth of gidya, though coolibah
and sandalwood are also in evidence.
Many native varieties of grass clothe
the pastures, Mitchell nd Flinders
being the predominating species.
Since its existence as a separate
enterprise it has been devoted chiefly
to the production of wool, though
the area is also highly suitable for
horned stock. The flock was founded
on “Barcaldine Downs” ewes, and is
now kept up to a high standard by
the introduction of pure merino
stock, rams from the “Boonoke” and
“Coonong” studs being imported
when necessary. Horses in sufficient
numbers for station use are also bred
on the property, surplus stock being
readily disposed of locally. When
Mr. P. Rollston entered upon the
management of “Ewen Plains” in
1910 the property had received but
little attention in regard to
improvements, but under his regime
has made much headway in this
respect, and may now be described as
a highly developed proposition.

dam provide the run with ample
water in all seasons. The troughing
is so arranged in the paddocks, which
number sixteen, that the distance
the stock has to travel to reach the
water does not exceed two miles on
an average. The homestead, which
is situated about 37 miles from
Prairie, and at a similar distance
from Warreah Siding on the Great
Northern Railway, was erected
under the administration of the
previous owner, though since the
advent of Mr. P. Rollston it has been
enlarged as occasion necessitated.
The main part of the dwelling rests
on high piles, the space beneath the
structure being utilized for lounge
and living rooms, which preserve a
delightful temperature during the
hot months of the summer. In the
vicinity of the homestead stand the
woolshed and other outbuildings
which are modern in all particulars,
the former being equipped with ten
stands containing Cooper machines
driven by an oil-engine. The
shearers’ quarters also are all that
could be desired, and, in fact, every
department of the industry carried
out under his supervision testifies to
the thorough and able administra-
tion of the managing partner of
“Ewen Plains” and “Coton
Vale.” The latter property, which
was selected in the year 1912, is also
a highly-developed concern, and
consists of 20,000 acres suitable for
either woolly or horned stock, the
block being at the present time
devoted to a small herd of short-
horn cattle. It lies some 25
miles north of “Ewen Plains,” and
is administered from that station.
The late CLAUDE VALEN-
TINE EVERINGHAM, “Glen-
moan,” Hughenden, was born at
Cook’s River, near Sydney, on
August 24, 1866, and is a son
of the late Matthew Evering-
ham, a native of England, who,
leaving Everingham Park, his home
in the Motherland, nearly three-
quarters of a century ago, settled on
the Hawkesbury River, New South
Wales, where he was well known as
one of the pioneers of the farming
and grazing industry and also in
connection with his building con-
tracts, many of the original homes
of the early settlers being the work
of his hands. In later years he
managed the stud department of
“Clarenden,” a noted pastoral pro-
perty then owned by the late Andrew
Towns, in honour of whose father
the flourishing capital of Northern
Queensland was named. The last days
of Mr. Matthew Everingham were
spent in Richmond, on the Hawkes-
bury River, New South Wales,
whence he crossed the Great Divide
in the late eighties. A family of
seven sons and three daughters
survived him, and of the former
three settled in Queensland and
engaged in pastoral pursuits. Mr.
C. V. Everingham was educated at
Windsor, New South Wales, ter-
minating his school days when
entering upon his teens, being then
faced with the necessity of deciding
upon a means of livelihood. Like
most high-spirited lads he was
strongly attracted by the life of the


bush and accepted a post with
a droving party in charge of
cattle despatched from “Woola-
roon,” on the Bogan, to the
Sydney markets at Homebush. Find-
ing the life much to his liking
he remained on the roads for a
considerable period, subsequently
accepting the management of
“Gravesend” Station, then in the
hands of the late William Ritchie,
which he took over in the year 1890.
His duties on “Gravesend” occupied
him for the following three years, at
the end of which period he resigned
his position in order to fill a more
lucrative post in a similar capacity
on “Oakley” Station, in the vicinity
of Torrens Creek, on behalf of that
fine old pastoral pioneer, the late
Robert Christensen. He remained
on “Oakley” until 1899, relinquish-
ing the managership of the property
in that year and throwing in his lot
with an exploring party bound for
Cape York Peninsula. His ex-
periences on this trip were of
an exciting description, he and
his party encountering armed
blacks who speared the horses and
constantly threatened the lives of the
explorers. On returning from the
prospecting expedition to more
settled parts he was offered, and
accepted, the management of “Crow-
fells,” an outstation of “Mallun-
gera,” retaining the post until 1901
when he established himself in
business at Walker’s Creek. Sub-
sequently he took over the Federal
Palace Hotel, the leading hostelry in
Richmond, where he filled the role of
“mine host” for two years. Realizing
that the hotel business was not suited
to his temperament, he sold his
interests in the Federal Palace in
1904 and returned to his earliest
occupation of droving, and while
so engaged was invited to re-enter the
pastoral industry in a managerial
capacity by Mr. Robert Grey, who
offered him control of “Glendower,”
a cattle station occupying country in
the vicinity of Prairie, and at that
time carrying a herd of 10,000.
Accepting Mr. Grey’s offer he took
over the administration of the station
on the completion of his droving
contracts and conducted it until
1910, in June of which year he
embarked upon a personal venture,
taking up the present homestead
block, the development of which sub-
sequently occupied his energies. This
property, which he named “Glen-
moan,” was one of the resumed
blocks formerly belonging to
“Glendower” Station. It embraces
some 25,000 acres of broken gidya
and boree plains country which pro-
duces a prolific growth of Mitchell,
Flinders, and blue grasses. The back
portion of the run is more heavily

timbered, in which locality ironbark
predominates, while the Flinders
courses through the property for a
distance of nearly eight miles, and
the country lying beyond is well
grassed and excellently suited for
cattle. The property is divided with a
natural barrier afforded by a range
of hills which extends in an almost
complete line through its centre, add-
ing materially to its value as shelter
for the stock. Cattle to the number
of 1,200, a small flock of sheep, and
50 horses graze over this naturally
favoured area. Mr. Everingham was
a lover of the equine and possessed
some very fine animals, which have
proved their mettle in stock work.
His managership of “Glendower”
affording him the opportunity of
becoming thoroughly acquainted with
the property ere its selection, the
site of the homestead was readily
decided upon, the building and its
surroundings now affording an
excellent example of what may be
achieved in a short space of time by
dint of industry and perseverance—
an example which is markedly
apparent in regard to the whole of
Mr. Everingham’s administration
and too much cannot be said of his
untiring energy, which succeeded in
converting almost virgin bush into
a highly improved and modern
pastoral proposition within a decade
of years. The dwelling, which was
erected in 1910, stands on the river’s
edge and discloses a view that is
extremely picturesque. No particu-
lar style of architecture was followed
in the construction of the dwelling,
the main object being to secure a
comfortable home, and this aim has
been completely attained. The inner
arrangements of the homestead are
in perfect taste and give expression
to the personality of the hostess of
“Glenmoan,” who, successfully com-
bining comfort and art has added the
crowning touch to this ideal home.
While dwelling ujron the excellence
of “Glenmoan” as a home, it is fitting
that we should mention the hospi-
tality that is its keynote and which
has been so heartily dispensed by Mr.
and Mrs. Everingham, who, both
descendants of old Australian
families, welcomed the coming guest
with a kindliness that was reminis-
cent of the days when this delight-
ful quality achieved for the bush a
fame that will live for many
years to come. The late Mr.
Everingham was always ready to
lend his support to any charitable,
patriotic, or other movement insti-
tuted for a worthy end, though,
being of a retiring disposition, he
declined the frequently urged
requests of his fellow-citizens that he
should take a more prominent part
in the public life of the district. He
was a keen and clean sportsman and
particularly inclined to racing, his
colours having met with frequent
success at various meetings (chiefly
amateur) held at different centres
from the coast to Cloncurry. It is
on record that at a meeting held at
Pentland in 1918, five out of six
events were adjudged in his favour,
similar success falling to his share
at the Prairie meeting of June,
1919, when again his colours
were to the fore in five races out
of six. Mr. Everingham married
in the year 1900 Ada, daughter of
Mr. William Carver, a native of
Hawkesbury, whose father, the late
Benjamin Carver, claimed descent
from old English stock, his forbears
having followed grazing and agri-
cultural pursuits through successive
generations. For long the late
gentleman and his several sons were
recognized amongst the best judges
of equine stock in the Mother State.
Of the union there is one daughter.

and even beyond its borders. For
many succeeding generations the
progenitors of the late Joseph Mott
were engaged in working their own
agricultural propositions; but that
gentleman, realizing the greater
scope for similar operation afforded
by farming land in Australia,
relinquished his earlier interests and
set sail for the young Continent.
Shortly after his arrival he secured
a farm at Mount Barker, in the
Mount Lofty Ranges, some thirty
miles distant from Adelaide, South
Australia, where he pursued the
industry for many years, and here
Mr. William Thomas Mott, the
father of Mr. R. J. Mott, was born.
Subsequently Mr. Joseph Mott
removed to Victoria, purchasing a
farm in the Western District of that
State, which occupied his energies as
far back as the late fifties, and still
remains as one of the old land-
marks near Hamilton, Victoria,
being known at time of writing
under its original designation of
“Mott’s Farm.” This sturdy old
pioneer of British birth resided
thereon until the time of his death,
which occurred in 1908 at the rip©
old age of ninety-four. During his
lifetime he was honoured by all who
had the opportunity of realizing his
sterling worth, and his memory is

a decade. In the year 1890 he

still held in affectionate remembrance
by many of his contemporaries of a
younger generation. He was survived
by a family of three sons. Leaving
the paternal rooftree in the late
Toowoomba, devoting his attention
to the wool industry and the local
horse trade. At the end of that
period, realizing the greater possi-
bilities of achieving success as an


independent pastoralist he purchased,
in the year 1894, Casuarina Island,
a property devoted to the raising
of sheep, but shortly afterwards
disposed ot the Island in order to
purchase ‘Buaraba” Estate on the
Darling Downs, where he turned his
attention to mixed farming and
grazing pursuits, personally super-
vising operations until the estate
was purchased by the Government of
the day for purjroses of closer settle-
ment. Subsequently towards the
latter end of 1898 he embarked on a
fresh venture, purchasing “Clutha”
Station, near Richmond, in the
with a quarter interest in the
proposition, and took up his residence
in Toowoomba, where he engaged in
commercial pursuits. On the advice
of his son in the year 1907 he
extended the scope of his pastoral
operations by the purchase of
"Bogunda” Station, a property
situated in the vicinity of “Prairie”
comprising some 56,000 acres of good
pastoral country. Since then the
property has been enlarged by the
purchase of surrounding blocks,
which have increased its acreage to a
figure considerably above 100,000,
the whole of which is used for the
tending to the welfare of the
several communities of which he has
formed a part at different periods,
and to all projects of a charitable or
patriotic nature. He married
Martha Louise, daughter of the late
John Donaldson, a native of the
North of Ireland, who became well
known in agricultural circles in
Victoria in the early fifties. Mr. R.
J. Mott, the only son of this union,
was born in Warialda, New South
Wales, on November 5, 1881. In
his ninth year he accompanied his
parents to Queensland, receiving his
primary education at Toowoomba.
He later attended the Ipswich
Grammar School, concluding his
studies at this institution at the age
of eighteen. Under the tuition of
his father he received a thorough
training in the many departments of
stock and station work, and rendered
invaluable assistance in combating
the ravages of the 1900-3 drought
which was severely felt at ‘'Clutha.”
However, the methods employed in
coping with events during this
disastrous visitation proved of
incalculable value to the younger
man, who in later years turned the
knowledge thus bitterly gained to
considerable advantage. When the
drought broke and the seasons
resumed their normal conditions, a
general movement of stock resulted,
which decided him to enlarge his
pastoral experience by undertaking
work as a drover, and he travelled

drought, which placed “Clutha” and
many surrounding properties in
fresh difficulties, the outcome being
that Mr. R. J. Mott was offered the
management of the station by his
father, which he accepted, and
having proved his mettle during this
trying period received a quarter
share in the estate as already
written. He held the reins of
control as managing partner for the
following five years, at the end of
which period he bought out his
father’s interest and administered
affairs as sole proprietor until the
year 1914 when he disposed of
“Clutha” and purchased “Ashton,”
an area situated in the same district.
Two years later he embarked on
another venture, purchasing “Pan-
dora,” an adjoining proposition
which he works in conjunction with
the homestead block. “Ashton”
and “Pandora,” which were origin-
ally part of “Lammermoor” Station,
embrace an area aggregating some
73,000 acres of mixed, open forest
country, alternating with stretches
of plain, the latter being character-
ized by the black soil so productive
of nutritious fodder for stock. The
principal timbers found on the runs
are box, gidya, and ironbark, in
addition to which several varieties
of edible scrub trees put forth a
sturdy growth. Numerous species

being Mitchell, Flinders, and blue
grasses. The natural water supply
is afforded by Tower Hill Creek,
which intersects the two runs, in
the bed of which are several deep
waterholes, rendering both proper-
ties free of water troubles. An
energetic and up-to-date system of
development has resulted in further
provision in this respect, four sub-
artesian bores and two wells having
been sunk, the latter supplying the
homestead with an abundance of
excellent water in all seasons. The
modern and scientific methods em-
ployed by the owner in all other
departments of his operations axe
everywhere apparent, the resultant
improvements including subdivision
into twenty-six paddocks, ranging in
extent from 750 acres upwards, the
largest having an area of 5,000
acres. Both sheep and cattle are
raised, the “Ashton” flock of mer-
inos having been built up by Mr.
Mott from 12,000 “Barcaldine

from “Goolgumbla,” a well-known

prominently identified with the
sporting life of Northern Queens-
land, and horses bearing his colours
—Oxford blue and gold sash—have
been exceptionally successful at local
meetings. For five years he was
president of the “Clutha” Picnic
Race Club and was accorded the
distinction of being elected a life
member of that body. He is also a
committeeman of the Prairie Jockey
Club and a member of all the
leading amateur race clubs of
Northern Queensland, and is well
known as a keen supporter of all
forms of clean sport. He is a Justice
of the Peace and a member of the
United Pastoralists’ and Grazing
Farmers’ Association. He married
in the year 1910 Belle, daughter of
the late Hugh Moore Dick, one of
the old-time settlers of Victoria.
Born in County Tyrone, Ireland, in
the year 1854, the late Mr. Dick
was brought to Victoria by his
parents when three years |of age.
While yet a lad in his teens he
engaged in landed enterprise in the
Goulburn River district, where he
remained until the year 1879, when
he journeyed to the Murray River
and purchased the old “Cobram”
homestead, near the town so named,
which then consisted of about 8,000
acres of land. During his long
sojourn in Victoria he prominently
participated in the various move-

The late HENRY ALBERT
COLDHAM, J.P., “Lammermoor”
Station, Prairie, Northern Queens-
land was born on August 11, 1863, at
"Grassdale” Station, near Hamilton,
MR. J. COLDHAM.
in the Western district of Victoria,
this property being at that time in
the possession of his father, the late
John Coldham. The last-mentioned
gentleman was a native of Norfolk
and a descendant of an old English
family, after whom the village of
Coldham in that County was named,
and which during different genera-
tions has contributed members to the
Ministry of the Church of England,
in which calling the grandfather of
the gentleman under review, the Rev.
John Coldham, officiated as rector in
his native village in Norfolk. Mr.
John Coldham arrived in Australia
with his brother George (also
deceased) in the late thirties, being
then somewhat under the age of
twenty. Directing their attention to
pastoral pursuits, the brothers took
up the country which comprised
“Grassdale,” residing thereon and
working the property conjointly for
a period. Eventually the partnership
was dissolved, Mr. John Coldham
retaining the original holding while
his brother devoted his energies to
the conduct of a proposition acquired
at a later date. “Grassdale” was
the home of the late pioneer during
the remainder of his life, and from
his headquarters there he took a
leading part in every movement of
importance connected with the
progress of the industry which he
represented and the welfare of the
surrounding district, of which he
was termed “the father.” It is on
record that on one occasion he crossed
swords with the existing Government
over a matter affecting the whole
pastoral position of the Western
district of the State, fighting and
winning the case against the Crown
at his own expense, and thus gaining
the further confidence and esteem of
the landowners. He was a man of
unusual attainments, being highly
cultured, a finished orator, and con-
versant with the principal literature
of past generations and of his own
day. Though often requested to
become a candidate for the seat in
the House of Assembly he con-
sistently declined the honour, the

political arena making no appeal to
him. In matters connected with his
particular calling be was an expert
and was well known all over the
Victorian State as a most successful
breeder of horses, and as a keen judge
of stock generally. In the year 1882
this pioneer of the thirties passed
away, being survived by a family of
six sons, who have proved themselves
worthy of the name they bear,
achieving for it prominence in
various fields of activity in their
native land. The late Walter T.
Coldham for many years was
regarded as one of Victoria’s most
brilliant barristers, Mr. TT. A.
Coldham, son of the late John
Coldham, was educated at the
hands of tutors under the paternal
rooftree and later at the Ham-
ilton College, leaving school at
the age of fifteen and entering the
service of the Bank of Australasia in
order to obtain a grounding in
financial affairs. After spending three
years in this institution he returned
to “Grassdale,” becoming initiated
into the many details of station work
under the guidance of his father,
whose thorough methods were respon-
sible for the development of similar
characteristics in his children, those
whose lines of life are centred in
landed enterprise showing by their
successful administration the value
of the training received at his
hands. In 1884, being then in
his twenty-first year, he was sent by
his father to “Wolfgang” Station, at
that time owned by a firm styled
John Coldham & Co.—of which Mr.
John Coldham was the principal
member —and carried on under the
management of Mr. F. H. B. Turner.
He fulfilled the duties of jackaroo at
“Wolfgang,” remaining on the
station under its subsequent manage-
ment by his late brother, John, the
eldest of the pioneer’s sons, until the
year 1889, when he decided to
engage in pastoral pursuits on his
own account, having been through

industry in the interval. His first
venture, which he named “Dun-
raven,” was originally a portion of
“Barcaldine Downs” Station, and
on its acquirement he immediately


set himself to the work of develop-
ment, making rapid headway in this
direction. Subsequently he was
joined in partnership by his brother,
Mr. Alfred E. Coldham, though the

personal administration of the area
remained in his own hands, the
former gentleman being occupied
with the conduct
of an adjoin-
ing property, of
which he was the
owner. Mr. H.
A. Coldham con-
tinued to develop
"Dunraven”
until 1891, in
which year, in
consequence of
the death of his
eldest brother,
Mr. John Gold-
ham, he returned
to “Wolfgang”
to take over the
management of
that estate, and
during the fol-
lowing eleven
years directed
his energies to
the active super-
vision of the
various branches
of the industry
in operation on the station. In the
year 1902 he relinquished active
business pursuits for a period and,
proceeding to Sydney, indulged in a
well-earned rest. Accustomed to the
untrammelled environment of the
bush, however, he soon tired of city
life, and, answering the call of the
wide spaces, returned to Queensland,
purchasing his brother’s share in
“Dunraven.” For some years he
personally administered this proposi-
tion, disposing of it in 1909, when he
again visited Sydney. In the follow-
ing year, in conjunction with Mr.
James Allison, he purchased “Lam-
mermoor” Station, a property
founded in the early sixties by the
late Robert Christison which was inti-
mately associated with the romantic
history of the early days of the
Queen State. At the time of its
purchase by the above-mentioned
gentleman, the run embraced 950
square miles of territory, upon which
were grazed over 25,000 head of
cattle. In the year 1911, on Mr.
Coldham’s suggestion, this large
area was subdivided into smaller
holdings and sold, the late
gentleman retaining on his own
behalf some 66,000 acres surround-
ing the original homestead. He
entered upon the active supervision
of the present “Lammermoor” in the
following year, and, until the time of
his death, administered affairs
through the medium of a resident
manager. Under the new order of

things the property was converted
into a sheep proposition, but the
owner later decided to depasture the
area with horned stock, to which it is
now chiefly devoted, sheep being
carried only to the number of about
5,000. The herd consists of some 4,000
well-bred Herefords, a class of c .ttle
for which the old station was highly
reputed for over half a century.

The cultivation of the area surround-

creating a floral paradise—rose beds
with perfect blooms, others adorned
with ornamental shrubs, the ferneries
and lawns and gravelled paths lying
beneath the shelter of large weeping
fig and mango trees, being so
completely arranged and carefully
tended that from whatever point the
house is approached the eye is greeted
by their beauty. Besides his many in-
terests centred in “Lammermoor,”
Mr. Coldham was connected with a
well-known stock and station agency
business in Sydney, having been a
member of the firm of Gordon &
Coldham, of that city. He received
his commission as Justice of the
Peace many years ago at the hands
of the Liberal Government then in
power. For several years he promi-
nently participated in the public life
of the Clermont district, having
occupied a seat on the Clermont
Divisional Board. Like his father he
was a keen judge of horseflesh and
though all forms of good clean sport
had a strong appeal for him, he
always inclined particularly to legiti-
mate horse racing. He was a member
of the Australian Jockey Club and
the Townsville Amateur Turf Club,
while for a period he was on the
members’ list of the Central Queens-
land Racing Executive. The different
pastoral bodies naturally claimed his
interest and included him in their list
of members. He was a member of the
Union Club, Sydney, the Queensland
Club, Brisbane, the North Queens-
land Club, Townsville, and of the
lecal club at Hughenden. In August,
1887, he married Helen Gordon,
daughter of the late Dr. Moffitt, of
Sydney, one of the leading medical
practitioners of his day. The late
gentleman was a member of an Irish
Protestant family which claims its
descent from one of the most ancient
in the North of Ireland. Mrs.
Coldham’s family is connected with
that of General Gordon, one of her
progenitors having married a sister
of that illustrious soldier. Of the
union there is a familv of two sons

operations being chiefly confined to
the Wimmera district, and his earlier
experience of farming pursuits in

locality and the father of agriculture
in Victoria. After many years spent
in connection with the agrarian
industry he crossed the border into
New South Wales, where, when he
had sufficient capital at his disposal,
he embarked on a pastoral venture,
purchasing “Wyuna Downs,” near
Bourke, the country beyond which
town was a portion of the Never-
Never. He devoted his energies to
grazing pursuits for some years,
being eventually forced to relinquish
his property owing to a combination
of circumstances such as droughts
and other adverse conditions, with
which, though armed with qualities
of industry and perseverance, he was
unable to cope, owing to his lack of
experience in the industry—a defi-
ciency that proved a stumbling block
to many a brave-hearted pioneer of
the period, and, as in the case of the
late Mr. Swanson, often resulted in
the loss of the accumulated savings

settled in Dubbo, where he engaged
in commercial pursuits for a period,
eventually joining the Great Major-
ity at the age of sixty-eight, his
desire of securing an independent
of 1914-18, spent three years on
active service in Egypt and France
and died at sea when returning to
his native land. Mr. John Sinnister
Swanson received a brief course of


scholastic training at the Dubbo
school. In order to contribute his
share towards the upkeep of his home
and family, he concluded his studies
when just entering upon his teens
and obtained a position as junior
assistant to an Inspector of the Lands
Department of New South Wales,
from whom he gleaned much know-
ledge relative to the legal position as
regarded Crown Land Laws, etc. He
remained in the Civil Service until
in his seventeenth year, when, feeling
strongly attracted by the land and
capable of doing a man’s work, he
obtained a post on “Warrana,” a
property situted in the Coonamble
district, New South Wales, where for
about two years he was occupied with
general stock and
station work. Sub-
sequently he be-
came engaged in
a variety of bush
occupations—shear-
ing, horse-breaking,
etc., and for some
considerable time
was connected with
the mining in-
dustry. Eventually
he accepted from
his maternal uncle
a post on “Nonda
Downs” Station,
on the Flinders
River, Northern
Queensland, and
was connected with
that property in
various capacities
—taking trips on
the roads as far
south as the mar-
kets of New South
W ales—for nearly
a decade. During
the latter years of his asso-
ciation with his uncle, he was
engaged in the management of
“Nonda Downs,” “Euthella,”
“Aberfoyle,” and “Yarrowmere” on
behalf of that gentleman, with whom
he finally severed his connection in
order to develop a small place of his
own on the coast. Immediately
after starting operations thereon he
received an offer from Mr. Edmund
Jowett, which induced him to forsake
his own project and take over the
management of "Rutland,” "Bar-
coorah,” "Eastmere,” and "Doong-
mabulla,” and the general super-
vision of other properties owned by
that well-known pastoralist. In 1917
he resigned his managerial duties in
connection with the above-mentioned
propositions, and again embarked
in the industry on his own
account, purchasing “Birricannia,”
which was then in the market, and
taking up his residence on the
property in March of the following
year. During his long career as a
station manager he was faced with,
and successfully met, the many crises
due to adverse seasons, industrial
stress, and other causes which proved
a source of discouragement to those
engaged in pastoral work, and has
now the satisfaction of looking back
upon such obstacles as stepping stones
to ultimate success. "Birricannia”
embraces about 100,000 acres of
country and is capable of carrying
some 25,000 sheep, though the area

is now devoted to both woolly and
horned stock, 12,000 sheep and about
1,000 head of cattle being depastured.
Horses are also carried. His
acquirement of this highly desirable
property is due to his amazing
industry and capable management
and the integrity of character which
distinguishes him, causing his honour
to be undoubted. Such characteris-
tics were closely observed by those
locally responsible for the direction
of finance, with the result that, when
funds were required for the purchase
of the property, he had no difficulty
in securing an advance equal to ten
times the capital he could personally
command. The estate is composed of
a number of selections which were
previously included in the acreage of
"Rockwood” and "Tower Hill”
Stations. These selections were
considerably improved in the way of
fencing, housing, etc., before coming
into the possession of Mr. Swanson,
but in the brief period that has
elapsed since his advent to the
property further development has
been inaugurated and pushed forward
with the energy that characterizes
him. Tower Hill and Station Creeks
provide ample water for the needs of
the stock, the beds of these waterways
containing holes of so permanent a
character that they have never been
known to fail even in exceptionally
arid seasons, consequently it has not
been necessary to resort to artificial
aid in this department of pastoral
development. The
homestead, which
is situated on
Tower Hill Creek
at a distance of
80 miles from
Prairie on the
Northern Railway
line, and about 100
miles from Aramac
on the Central Spur
line, is an airy,
well - ventilated
building, adapted
to the conditions of
the Northern clim-
ate and providing
everything to be
desired in the way
of comfort and con-
venience. Devoting
his energies ex-
clusively to pastoral
affairs, he has
never actively iden-
tified himself with
public life, though
he accords his
support to all local movements set
afoot for the advancement of the
district. He is a member of the
Tower Hill Picnic Race Club and the
Oakley Race Chib, two local bodies
instituted for the promotion of
amateur sport. He was married in
the year 1901 to Ada, daughter of
the late John Houston, who was born
in Singleton, New South Wales, and
whose premature death occurred at
the age of thirty-seven, Mr. Houston,
who was of Celtic origin, owned a
farm at Golden Valley, Victoria,
having been one of the pioneers of
the industry in that State. He was
also engaged in commercial pursuits
for a period. Of the union there is
a family of three sons and two
daughters.


JAMES THOMPSON SAVAGE,
J.P., Hughenden, proprietor of
‘Tona” and formerly owner of
Dalraer,” two stations lying in the
vicinity of Hughenden and Prairie,
MR. J. SAVAGE.
Northern Queensland, and “Oaringi,”
near Oakey in the Darling Downs
respectively, was born at Murphy’s
Creek, near Toowoomba, on March
20, 1880. He is a son of Mr. James
Savage, a gentleman of Irish birth
and descent, countless of whose pro-
genitors were identified with farming
pursuits on their own land in the
North of Ireland, throughout which
portion of the country the family is
still well known and held in high
esteem, certain of its members yet
occupying the old home of their
forbears near “Coalbrook,” Ennis-
killen, where the founder of the line
which has been established under the
Southern Cross was born. Mr.
Savage, sen., was in his middle teens
when, attracted by the glamour and
romance intertwined with the stories
that reached him of life in Australia,
he decided to try his fortune under
the promising conditions afforded in
the young Continent, the portrayal of
which had so stirred his imagination.
Arriving in Queensland at a period
dating considerably more than half
a century back, shortly after the
then Colony had been granted sep-
aration by the Mother Country, he
turned his attention to those pursuits
with which he had become familiar
in Ireland and to which so many
members of his family had devoted
themselves during past generations,
acquiring a small freehold farm near
the township known as Murphy’s
Creek, thus taking the first step in
a career, the fruits of which so justly
entitle him to rank among the pion-
eers of the State which had the
benefit of his fine qualities of citizen-
ship. For about ten years he
conducted farming operations on the
above-mentioned property, the abil-
ity which was bi’ought to bear in
regard to its development and
general administration resulting in
the achievement of unqualified
success. Realizing that a much
larger share of prosperity was
attainable through the medium of
the pastoral industry than would be
possible in the calling which then
MR. J. T. SAVAGE.
engaged his energies, and finding
himself at the end of the above-
mentioned period in a position to
acquire an interest in that larger
sphere of enterprise, he made a bid
for fortune by the purchase of a
cattle station in Western Queensland
having previously disposed of his
farm to his brother, Robert. He
named his newly-acquired country
"Coalbrook,” after his native place
in Ireland, and for 15 years was
engaged in its development, his work
being marked by that persevering
industry that characterized the
efforts of the pioneers and often
enabled them to pull through in
spite of adverse conditions. At one
time “Coalbrook” depastured some
15,000 cattle, but unfortunately the
unsatisfactory state of the markets
prevented him from benefiting from
his production as the price of horned
stock was then as low as 7s. per
head. The financial pressure result-
ing from this depression in the
industry eventually compelled him to
relinquish “Coalbrook” and thus of a
necessity forego the prosperity that
later attended the conduct of this
station. Contenting himself with a
smaller concern named “Banyan,”
situated on the Tully River in the
district outlying Cardwell, Northern
Queensland, he has for the past
decade devoted his energies to the
conduct of that property, which he
also developed for cattle ; and though
now having reached the allotted span
of three-score years and ten is yet
actively engaged in carrying out the
industry on its acres. Since his
occupation of “Banyan” he has
engaged on occasions in various kinds
of developmental work in connection
with both pastoral enterprise and
railway construction and in respect
to the latter phase of governmental
operations fulfilled the contracts for
all the cuttings through the Hough-
ton Valley country and assisted in
laying the rails on that section of
the North-western line which was
then in course of alteration and
construction. He married Esther,

daughter of the late Richard
Watson, the founder of a family
which has been closely associated
with the history of Ipswich for
considerably over sixty years, and

that at the time
of its disposal many
years later the pro-
perty was regarded
as one of the
best developed in
the countryside.
In the year 1913
Mr. Savage became
by purchase the
sole owner of the
station, and from
that date until
1918 conducted it on his own behalf,
disposing of it to the Messrs.
Surgeon Bros, in the latter year, the
high state of development then
existing on the property as a
result of his able administration
during the past quarter of a century
standing as an example of what may
be achieved by a man of the calibre
of the subject of our memoir, and
promising to remain as a memorial
of honest work faithfully performed
for many years to come. His object
in disposing of “Woodbine” was to
seek partial retirement from business
cares, but the environment and
habit of years held sway over a
disposition naturally active and was
responsible after a few months for
his re-entry into the industry as a
stock-owner, and as a sequence,
for the purchase of “Dalraer,” a
cattle property situated near Prairie,
and “lona,” a similar proposition
adjoining “Redcliff” Station. He
stocked “Dalraer” with mixed cattle
bred at “Savannah,” in the Flinders
district, and later transferred a mob
from the latter property to “Iona”
-on which he depastured also cattle
purchased from other stations.

Using his newly-acquired runs as
grazing propositions he then went in
for extensive dealing operations,
owning several mobs of cattle which
were run on agistment on various
properties lying between the North
and the district outlying Charleville,
his two stations being then well
stocked. The acreage contained in
“Dalraer” and “Iona” approximates
a figure somewhat in excess of 30,000.
Downs and tableland are comprised
in the area of “lona,” the former
being nicely sheltered by belts of
gidya and boree and bearing a
luxuriant growth of Mitchell and
Flinders grasses, while the tableland
is composed of open forest country
which produces spinifex chiefly
though many other useful grasses
and herbage abound. Dalraer,’

earliest pioneers of that State, the
family having been associated with
the agricultural industry in the then
Colony as far back as the middle of
the last century. Since early man-

“FAIRLIGHT” Station, Hugh-
euden, Queensland (Proprietor,
Alexander McGregor Stuart Thomp-
son, J.P.). This well-known pastoral
property first came into possession
MR. J. THOMPSON.
of the Thompson family in the early
eighties, when it was purchased
from the late Robert Stewart —who
a decade earlier was identified with
pioneer enterprise in that part of
the State by the late James
Thompson, father of the present
owner and founder of the notable
“Mount Emu Plains” Station, in
the same district. Upon the demise
cf this prominent pastoralist his
estate was divided, “Fairlight” fall-
ing to the share of the gentleman
under review, but at a later date
the members of the family agreed to
form the estates lately owned by
their father into a company, to be
known under the title of “The
Mount Emu Pastoral Company,
Limited,” of which Mr. A. McG.
Stuart Thompson was appointed
chairman, and which for several
years ran a successful course under
his able supervision. In 1912 the
company disposed of the properties,
and the latter gentleman then
bought “Fairlight,” which has re-
mained in his possession ever since.
In 1913 he added to his historical
acres by the purchase of “Wonga-
lee,” which lies sufficiently in the
vicinity of “Fairlight” to allow of
the personal supervision of Mr.
Thompson, who makes his home at
the last-named station, controlling
the big area over which his interests
extend from the old homestead.
About 600 square miles represent
the extent of the joint proper-
ties, which are devoted exclusively
to cattle and horses, and are
considered capable of carrying a
herd of 20,000, besides a large repre-
sentation of equine stock. During
the severe drought which terminated
in the early part of 1916, about
14,000 cattle and over 500 horses
were grazed in the “Fairlight” and
“Wongalee” runs. A special and
interesting feature of the enterprise
is the shorthorn stud, which origin-
ally was founded with pure-bred
stock procured from the “Grace-
mere” Station stud, and has been
built up with such care and diligence
that it is now cited as an example
MR. A. MCG. S. THOMPSON.
of the perfection which may be
achieved in connection with such an
undertaking in Northern Queens-
land. To this branch of his industry
Mr. Thompson has given much per-
sonal attention and has made a close
study of the conditions under which
the various details of its operations
may be brought to a successful con-
clusion. He has carefully observed
the results of experimental breeding
and of any improvement brought
about by the introduction of prize
stock from the noted herds of the
Southern States, and has exercised
such excellent judgment with regard
to the building up of the stud that
the “Fairlight” cattle have now
thoroughly established their reputa-
tion, their fine qualities being too
well known to require detailed de-
scription in this article. The
draught horses bred upon the estate
have also been made the subject of
very favourable comment on the part
of those well qualified to express an
opinion on such matters; but, para-
mount in the interest of the owner
is the blood-horse stud, which is well
to the fore among other enterprises
of its kind in the State. Mr.
Thompson, at the present time, is
using as sires such horses as the im-
ported “Eurasian” and “Eagle
Craig,” from the best strains in the
United Kingdom; but he is far from
disdaining the splendid products of
Australian pastoral stations, more
than one of which has figured pro-
minently in his stud paddocks as sire
to some of the promising young pro-
geny which, in course of time, have
gone forth to uphold the credit of
Northern Queensland in other por-
tions of the Island Continent; while
the stud mares at “Fairlight” are
picked fillies, purchased by Mr.
Thompson as opportunity has oc-
curred, at the annual sales of blood
stock held in the Southern States.
The character of the country com-
prising “Fairlight” and “Wonga-
lee” is well suited to the purpose for
which the land was first acquired by
the father of the present owner, wide

and marked by scattered, basaltic
rocks, giving place to undulating
country, interspersed with timbered
ridges, where gidya and boreetrees pre-
dominate, both of which hardwoods


are valuable for many uses
on the station, though not quite
suited to the important purposes of
building. The estate is well watered,
its supply being drawn from various

and at a depth of 500 feet this ex-
ceptional flow was obtained. “Fair-

stations in the district, and although
“Wongaiee” has not yet been the
aim and intention at no very distant
date to bring it np to the standard

S. Thompson, J.P., was born at
Allansford, in the western district of


Victoria, on September 13, 1861,
and is the third son of the late James
Thompson, who was numbered
among the best-known of the early
pastoral pioneers of that State. The
late gentleman—who was the founder
of this branch of the Thompson
family in Australia—hailed from

Scotland, where for hundreds of
years his progenitors were well-
known landed proprietors in the
vicinity of the great commercial
centre, Glasgow. While only a lad
in his early teens, James Thompson
experienced the stirrings of a desire
to see something of the greater world
beyond the narrow confines of
his birthplace, and circumstances
name. He became well known among
the pioneer sheep men of that
period, and having spent several
years in successful enterprise of this
nature in the Garden State, he
turned a serious ear to the reports
current concerning the splendid
possibilities of the distant tracts of
country beyond the Moreton Bay
colony, which as yet lay practically
untouched, only the fringe of the
greater beyond having witnessed the
beginnings of settlement. The
separation of the north from the
parent portion of the immense area
originally proclaimed as New South
Wales drew public attention to the
Colony which thus asserted its right
one of a partnership with the late
Messrs. Jamieson and Murichson, in
which he held the senior position,
and, striking out for Queensland,
purchased cattle and sheep on the
Darling Downs, which were over-
landed to Bowen and thence to
“Craigie” Station—now absorbed in
“Wonda Vale,” some 170 miles west
of Townsville. In this trip he was
accompanied by Mr. Murichson, and
these two intrepid spirits, after en-
during all the hardships and priva-
tions of a trying journey over coun-
try new to them both, found the
place for which they had been bound
unsuited to sheep, and had perforce
to start on exploring trips in the
surrounding areas, to discover if pos-
sible a locality where their woolly
charges could be adequately depas-
tured. As a result, the valuable
run, afterwards known as “Mount
Emu” Station, was taken up by the
partners, this property, which they
stocked with sheep, subsequently
making its name as one of the best
pastoral stations in the State, and
demonstrating even to the present
day the good judgment and foresight
which determined the choice of the
wise old pioneers. The founding of
“Mount Emu” meant the abandon-
ment of “Craigie,” all the stock in
time being transferred from that
holding to the richer acres of the
later discovery, and here for eight
years the firm carried on operations
on most successful lines, doing much
for the settlement of the district
and establishing a thoroughly pros-
perous proposition. At the termina-
tion of this period the partnership
permitting the indulgence of this im-
pulse, he left his native heath and
sailed for the antipodes, eventually
settling in Victoria, where he in-
vested his patrimony in the purchase
of pastoral interests, establishing the

years earlier, Mr. Thompson, am-

being early in the new field, made

when Mr. Thompson purchased the
sole interestsim Mount Emu and
from the date of dissolution (1870)
until the time of his death he con-
tinned to be a very live influence in
the district lus activity in the pas-
loral industry making him a most


important factor in its progress. With
no hand to stay him, he was able to
act entirely on his own initiative,
and his temperament leading him to
make fresh ventures he was soon
negotiating for the purchase of the
“Rupert Creek’’ property, then
owned by Mr. Mosman, the name of
which he changed to “Tarbrax,”
after his old paternal estate in Scot-
land. Having completed this trans-
action, he lost no time in introducing
all the necessary elements to put the
property on an equal footing with
“Mount Emu,” and when “Tar-
brax” was well established and bid-
ding fair to produce cattle which
should hold their own with the best
in Australia, Mr. Thompson was once
more getting ready to extend his
landed possessions in the district.
This time his eye was cast on
Clutha ’ Station, which received its
name from Mr. Thompson, who took
it up as a pastoral lease and worked
it in conjunction with his two older
properties for some time. In the
early eighties he decided to dispose
of this latest acquisition and to pur-
chase “Fairlight,” and continued to
operate successfully as a pastoralist,
being assisted by his sons in the
management of his various interests.

in Victoria prior to his advent to
Queensland, and was joined by his
wife and family of six children upon

after leaving that State, finally dis-
posing of the whole of his Southern
interests when he severed his con-
nection with Messrs. Jamieson and
Murichson and assumed sole pro-
prietorship of the northerly run. Mr.
Alexander‘McGregor Stuart Thomp-
son, J.P., received his education at
the old-established Camden College,
New South Wales (now closed as a
secondary school and used as a
theological college), and at the High
School, Hobart, Tasmania, which
building has since been utilized for
the University of Tasmania. At the
completion of his scholastic career
he returned to Queensland, where
his early days had been spent, and
obtaining a good grasp of the prin-
ciples of the pastoral industry while
yet in his early teens, he was en-
trusted by his father with the
management of “Tarbrax,” which
he carried on successfully for a num-
ber of years, working in unison with
his brothers, who had charge of
other portions of the paternal estate.
Upon the demise of his father he
took over “Fairlight,” and subse-
quently became chairman of the
Mount Emu Pastoral Company,
Limited, as already written; again
securing ownership of his present
property when the Company disposed
of its interests in 1912, since

addition, he is a good sportsman,
being president of the North-
Western Amateur Turf Club and
vice-president of the Hughenden
Jockey Club; and no matter of local
importance is considered properly
inaugurated without the seal of his
approval and co-operation. Mr.
Thompson was married in 1890 to
Ellen Jane, daughter of the late
James Gordon, first police magis-
trate of Townsville, who, with Cap-
tain Sinclair, was co-discoverer of
the fine harbour of Port Denison in
1859. In connection with this event
it is of interest to note that the
expectation of a handsome reward
had been held out by the New South
Wales Government; to be given to
the discoverer of a good harbour
north of Port Curtis. Before Cantain


Sinclair’s party was in a position to
claim the reward, however, separa-
tion had taken place, and a petition
presented to the Queensland Parlia-
ment resulted only in the appoint-
ment of Captain Sinclair as harbour-
master and of Mr. Gordon as first
Customs officer of the newly-founded
port of Townsville. In the course of
his career Mr. Gordon held practic-
ally every official position of import-
ance in thebuilding-up of the northern
settlements of the infant Colony. He
was descended from the family of
Gordons so well known for centuries
as influential bankers in Dumfries,
Scotland, members of which are still
connected with some of the biggest
financial institutions in the Old
World. Mrs. Thompson’vS brother is
the notable Major Robert Gordon,
of the Gordon Highlanders, with
which regiment he served through-
out the many engagements in the
Afridi and Boer Wars, and who now
holds a command in Rhodesia. Mr.
and Mrs. Thompson have a family
of three sons and five daughters.
It is worthy of mention that
the late James Thompson’s son.
David Westwood Burke Thompson,
who served in the Boer War and
died on the return of the transport
to Australia, was the first white
child born in the Burke district of
Queensland. Other surviving mem-
bers of the family are Mr. A. S.

toral pursuits in New South Wales,
and a daughter, widow of the late
W. W. Voss, of “Pewrice” Station,

MAJOR ROY MORELL, 0.8. E.,
D. 5.0., “Morval,” Maxwelton, is
the second son of Mr. James Harris
Morell, of Sydney, well known in
business circles as manager of a
branch of The Aiistralian Bank of
Commerce, Ltd., in that city. Mr.
Morell, sen., is a member of an
ancient Huguenot family, which
settled iri the North of Ireland in
1572, at the time of the Revocation
of the Edict of Nantes, and has since
contributed various members to the
Church and Civil Service; his father,
Rev. C. L. Morell, D.D., having
been a clergyman of the Presbyterian
Church in Dimgannon, County
Tyrone, and a Commissioner of
National Education. The subject of
this memoir, Major Roy Morell,
was born at Wollongong, New South
Wales, and received his earlier
education at different centres at
which his father happened to be
stationed, eventually being sent to
Sydney to study at the well-known
Newington College. On leaving
school he became engaged in survey
work, journeying to Queensland as
assistant to his elder brother, Mr. C.
L. Morell, one of a staff of
surveyors at that time engaged in
cutting up resumed land in this
State for purposes of closer settle-
ment. He continued with Mr. C.
L. Morell in a professional capacity
until the year 1912, when, in
conjunction with the latter and other
brothers, he became part owner of a
grazing property, to the development
cause of liberty, humanity and
justice. Actuated by similar ideals,
his four brothers also donned khaki
and two of these sons of Australia
were awarded the Military Cross,

Roy Morell enlisted as a trooper of
the 6th Light Horse Regiment and
embarked from Sydney on the
troopship “Suevic,” in December
three months later, his Captaincy
being received in Egypt in March,
1916, and his Majority in France
in March of the following year. On
leaving the Eastern Front, he served
with the 13th Brigade at Pozieres,
Paschendaele, Messines, Dernan-
court, and Villers Bretonneux
under Brig-General (now Major-
General! Sir William Glasgow. He
returned to England after the
signing of the Armistice in 1918,
and shortly afterwards embarked for
Australia, arriving in Sydney on
June 19, 1919. In due course he
resumed his connection with pastoral
affairs and is now engaged in that
industry at “Morval,” a sheep
proposition lying about 15 miles from
Maxwelton, Northern Queensland.
In November, 1918, he married
Frances lone, daughter of Mr.
Charles E. Pole Carew, of Park Hill,
Totnes, Devon, England, a member
of a family of aristocratic lineage,
which may be traced back to a very
early period in the histories of
Devonshire and Cornwall. Mr. C.
E. Pole Carew is a brother of
General Sir Reginald Pole Carew,
the head of this ancient line, a
distinguished Englishman, promin-
ent in his time in the military
history of the Motherland, whose
seat, “Antony,” occupies an his-
torical site near Plymouth. Mrs.

JAMES STEWART-MOORE,
owner of “Dunluce," Ilughenden,
and ‘‘Con Amove,” Corfield, was
born on June 18, 1876. He is the
eldest son of James Stewart-Moore,
MR. J. STEWART-MOORE, SEN
J.P., Deputy-Lieutenant of County
Antrim, Ireland, whose ancestry
dates back to the days closely follow-
ing the famous battle of Culloden,
MR. C. F. STEWART-MOORE
when the founder of the family in
Ireland, a Scottish refugee, bearing
the name of Stewart, settled in
Antrim, and there married a
daughter of the house of Moore, of
Ballydivity, assuming at wedlock,
the older family name of his wifeJ
From the date of its foundation, the!
family of Stewart-Moore has been!
notably identified with the history of j
Antrim, where, as already mentioned,
it is still prominently represented in
the person of the Deputy-Lieutenant
of the County. Mr. Stewart-Moore,
sen., married Elizabeth Frances
Jane, daughter of Mr. Charles
Stuart, who fought with Wellington
at the Peninsula. Mr. Charles
Stuart is a member of another old
North of Ireland family of Scottish
origin, who established themselves in
the country at about the same period
that witnessed the foundation of the
paternal side of the house, from
which the owner of ‘‘Dunluce” is
descended. In later times the Stuarts
achieved prominence in pastoral life
in the far distant land of Australia,
two of the maternal uncles of the
gentleman under review, Messrs.
James and Henry Stuart (who were
twins), having arrived in New South
Wales in the early seventies and
become associated with the late
Samuel McCaughey (afterwards Sir)
in landed enterprise in that State.
Subsequently, in partnership with
the same gentleman, they acquired a
large station property in Queensland
known as “Emmet Downs." Dispos-
ing of the last-named property the
firm purchased “Rockwood" about
the year 1882. Early in the present
century Messrs. Wallace and George
Stuart, who had arrived in the
eighties, were admitted as partners
with Sir Samuel McCaughey of the
historical Queensland property known
as “Rockwood," situated in Western
Queensland, the last-named gentle-
man being the principal financier of
the concern in the beginning and
continuing to hold an interest in it
until the date of its disposal in the
year 1911. At the end of a career,
marked by his participation in many
forward movements bearing on the
progress of his adopted country
through the expansion of the great
industry which he represented, Mr.
Henry Stuart joined the Great
Majority. James and Wallace, after
the sale of “Rockwood," returned to
the land of their birth and now live
in retirement within a few miles of
their early home, while George
remains in harness as the owner of
“Goolgumbla” Station, New South
Wales. The last-mentioned gentleman
and his brother Wallace formed

through different eras of Scottish and
Irish history. The third, Henry,

Charles, who was attached to the
2nd Leinsters, returned to Australia
in 1920. The last-named gentleman
is the owner of a property called
"Sandalwood,” lying in the vicinity
of Hughenden. Mr. James Stewart-
Moore, of "Dunluce,” was born
at "Ballydivity” House, County
Antrim, Ireland, and educated at
Trinity College, Dublin. In the year
1899, being then at the age of twenty-
three, and imbued with confidence as
to the great possibilities of pastoral
life in Australia, he set sail for the
Island Continent with the object of
gaining experience of the conditions
under which the industry was con-
ducted in the land he intended to
adopt. On arrival he proceeded to
Western Queensland, where, at
“Rockwood,” under the supervision
of his maternal uncle, he was first
initiated into the routine of station
life. He remained at "Rockwood”
for three years, at the termination of
which period, in 1902, he revisited
his native land. After spending about
two years in the Old World he set out
once more for Australia, and, making
his home at "Rockwood,” continued

expedite and facilitate the handling
of the stock. A site, distant some 22
miles from Hughenden (with which
centre it is connected by telephone),
is occupied by the homestead, which
was built by Mr. Stewart-Moore in
the year 1909. It comprises a main
building of modern bungalow archi-
tecture and detached quarters, and
ideally fulfils the requirements
imposed by the climate. The
bungalow, which contains six rooms
and is furnished with wide verandahs,
is situated in proximity to the
principal bore, from which water is
laid on to house and garden. A
luxuriance of foliage adds to the
natural beauty of the surroundings,
which include roses of many varie-
ties, shrubs and other decorative
growths, and citrus trees, the fruit
of which proves so great a boon. In
the year 1911, finding the area at his
command insufficient for his purpose,
he acquired further territory by the
purchase of a block on the resumed
portion of “Sesbania” Station. This
property, on which he bestowed the
name of “Con Amore” is about
30,000 acres in extent, and, combined
with the “Dunluce” acreage brings
his landed interests to a figure in the
region of 55,000 acres. The two
properties are divided by a distance
of 60 miles, and in the successful
administration of both, which are run
conjointly and to which he personally
devotes himself, the owner finds

CHARLES KLEIN PEEL, J.P.,
“Antrim,” Hughenden, was born at
"Everton,” near Beechworth, Vic-
toria, on September 28, 1862, and is
a son of the late James Peel, who
was a pioneer pastoralist of Victoria,
having owned “Everton” Station,
once a well-known grazing property
but which lost its identity as a single
proposition when cut up for the
purposes of closer settlement. Mr.
James Peel came from an old Irish
family, his progenitors having been
settled on the land in farming and
grazing pursuits and prominently
identified with all movements of local
importance in the North of Ireland
for many generations. Being of
an adventurous disposition, and
attracted by the latent possibilities
of the newly-opened goldfields in the
Southern Continent and the stirring
life and romantic incidents which
were then their accompanying feat-
ures, the late gentleman became one
of that company of hardy and
intrepid spirits, who, leaving their
native land to search for the yellow
metal in the rough days when the
industry was born, paved the way to
a more advanced stage of civilization
in their adopted country. In the
middle fifties he sought the smile of
Fortune on the Bendigo and other
vicinity of Beechworth, late in the
same decade. Over ten years of his
life were spent in the development of
this station which he was forced to
relinquish in the early seventies in

consequence of the effects of the
drought which visited Victoria at
that period—his lot being similar to
means of livelihood. The above-
mentioned gentleman secured a post
as stock-buyer for the Government of
of the day, in which capacity he
purchased the supplies of milking
cattle, etc., required for public
asylums and various charitable insti-
tutions and rendered expert advice
as to their management, etc., retain-
ing this post until his death which
occurred in the late eighties. He was
survived by a family of three sons
and four daughters, of which the
gentleman under review was the only
member to become identified with
Queensland. Mr. C.„ K. Peel
attended the Kew High School in
Victoria, completing his studies at
that academy when at the age of
sixteen, thereafter entering the
Colonial Bank, Melbourne, where he
was engaged in clerical duties for a
period of eighteen months. Resign-
ing his position on the advice of a
friend, the late A. J. Miller, who
had pastoral interests in Queensland,
he joined that gentleman in a trip
to the Northern State in order to
gain some experience of life on the
land, with the end in view, if such
proved to his liking, of carving a
career in the pastoral industry. He
arrived in Queensland with Mr.
Miller in the year 1882 and shortly
diggings, but finding that most
unreliable dame chary of her favours
he decided to settle down to pastoral
pursuits, purchasing “Everton,” a
grazing property situated in the

afterwards set out with the latter
from "Banchory” Station, Clermont,
for the Flinders with a mob of 1,000
heifers. The severity of a drought
then reigning caused Mr. Miller to


abandon his first intention, and
therefore, leaving his young friend
in charge of the cattle, en route, he
proceeded to Hughenden, where he
disposed of the mob, their destina-
tion under the care of Mr. Peel
being altered to “Bongondoo”
pastoral centre, and there met the
late James Thompson, the elder
brother of the present owner of
“Fairlight” Station, this meeting
resulting in a friendship and
eventuating in his acceptance of a
post on “Fairlight,” as jackaroo. He
continuing in this capacity until the
marriage of the last-mentioned
gentleman, who thereafter resided on

Mr. Peel. Some years later, as a

remained on the station for over five
years, early showing his natural
aptitude in all matters relating to
stock, and eventually was appointed
to the post of head stockman, being
entrusted as charge-hand with all

“Tarbrax,” two other stations
sen., the sphere of his duties was
extended by the executors of the
estate, who placed “Mount Emu”
also under his charge. In the year

Peel married Emily, widow of the

included in the proprietary of the
Thompson family, the last-mentioned
being the principal fattening area
owned by them. In 1887 he was trans-
ferred as head stockman and overseer
to “Tarbrax,” then under the man-
agement of the late R. T. Thompson,
late R. T. Thompson and daughter
of Mr. Edgar Atkins (also deceased),
who was a well-known identity of
Ballarat, Victoria. After his mar-
riage he joined Mr. A. M. S.
Thompson, and that gentleman’s
younger brother, the late Stuart


Thompson, in the purchase of
“Mount Emu” and “Tarbrax” from
the Thompson estate. Subsequently
these two properties were amalga-
mated with “Fairlight” and a more
recently purchased station called
“Saxby,” the several propositions
being run by the partners as
company concerns for some time
under the title of the “Mount Emu
Pastoral Company.” Eventually
these arrangements were altered, the
partners each purchasing a property
on his own account, under which
plan the subject of our memoir
became the owner of “Mount Emu.”
He personally administered this
historic old station until 1914, in
which year he disposed of it and
purchased “Antrim,” a property
situated within 60 miles of Hughen-
den in a southerly direction and
which originally formed part of
“Rookwood” and “Barenya” Sta-
tions. “Antrim” consists of 45,000
acres of rolling downs alternating
with belts of timbered country, the
latter bearing gidya and boree and
providing invaluable camping ground
for the stock. Coolibah prevails in
considerable quantities along the
creeks and waterways, chief among
the latter being the Landsborough
River, which follows its course
through the run for a few miles.
The high state of development now
existing on “Antrim” is almost
entirely the outcome of Mr. Peel’s
administration, the run having been
subdivided into 21 paddocks, the
largest of which is about 9,000
acres, and an artesian bore put
down to supplement the output of
one already in existence. These two
sources and a supply provided by the
“Barenya” bore, afford ample water
for the needs of the stock in all
seasons. Some 14,000 merinos com-
pose the “Antrim” flock and these
have achieved a high reputation both
as wool and mutton producers, the
fleece commanding high prices almost
equal to the highest secured by any
station in the district, bringing up to
224 d. in the grease during the
Commonwealth Wool Appraisement
of 1918. Following the purchase of
“Antrim” Mr. Peel established a
high-class stud herd of shorthorn
cattle, proceeding to Melbourne
where he purchased 15 stud book
cows from Mr. J. L. Dugdale’s well-
known herd and 13 from the
“Strathalbyn” stud, owned by Mr.
Alex. W. Edgar, which is so favour-
ably known all over the Common-
wealth. Having secured these he
bought the “Lindenow" bull, “Duke
of Derrimut 346th,” at the Sydney
sales of that year, transferring the
stock to “Antrim” where the result
of this carefully-considered mating
is already apparent, the fine short-
horn bulls produced on the estate
being much in demand in Northern
Queensland and fetching very
satisfactory prices—proof that the
pastoralists of the North are appre-
ciative of the enterprise which
enables them to introduce the best
blood of the South into their herds.
The stud cows include “Cherry

(14007). Mr Peel has always been a
keen student of horse lore and has
formed a stud at “Antrim” of which
much is expected in the future. The
two reigning sires, which were
previously in use at “Mount Emu,”
are “Skopelos” (imp.) by “Pericles”
by “Persimmon” and “Royal Eagle”
(imp.) by “Filigrave” by ‘‘Galopin.”
To those having a knowledge of
horseflesh such names speak for
themselves, the blood of the former
stallion being the best in England


even at the present day. Nineteen
stud-book mares purchased as year-
lings at Sydney and Melbourne at
prices varying from 90 to 100 guineas
further justify the expectations
entertained in respect to the future
of the stud, as when mated with
merely first-class mares, “Skopelos”
and "Royal Eagle” sired progeny
which have proved very satisfactory
for stock and station work. At time
of writing the horses running on the
property number 250, of which 90
are draughts, while of the re-
mainder some 50 are bred in the
purple. The Clydesdale stock also
deserve special mention, the sire,
“Erskine Hero” foaled in 1910 at the
famous McGreggor Clydesdale stud

in New Zealand and purchased at
Melbourne as a yearling during Mr.
Peel’s ownership of "Mount Emu”
and afterwards transferred to
“Antrim,” being by “Erskine’s
Pride,” who notably distinguished
himself in the show ring, as will be
seen by the following record, which
also sets forth the achievements of
other ancestors of the “Antrim”
heavy sire. “Erskine’s Pride” (613,
N.Z.5.8.) “Lord Erskine”
(505, N.Z.5.8.) gained in 1906 first
and champion prizes at Ashburton,
second prize and reserve champion
and the Lord Rothschild silver bowl
for the best-bred colonial stallion,
either Shire or Clydesdale, at the
International Show, Christchurch;
in 1907 he won first prize, champion
prize, and grand champion prize at
Manawatu and West Coast Society’s
Show, Egmont A. and P. Show,
and Taranaki Metropolitan Show.
G. grandsire, “Sandy Erskine”
(10900, C. 5.8., imp.) won first and
champion prizes at Omaru and
Dunedin Shows in 1900 and 1901.
G. grandsire, “Prince Alexander”
(8899, C. 5.8.), when foaled, was sold
for .£1,200 and afterwards gained
the following prizes, viz., in 1890 as
a yearling, first and champion at
H. Show, Dundee; in 1891, first
prize at Glasgow, Edinburgh, and
the royal at Doncaster; in 1892,
first prize and Cawder Cup at the
Scottish Stallion Show; and in 1903
gained second prize at the High-
land Society’s Show, at Edinburgh.
As may be inferred from the
foregoing, the progeny of "Erskine
Hero” are widely reputed, so much
so, that the demand for the
“Antrim” heavy horses is generally
in excess of the supply. Under Mr.
Peel’s regime, the homestead, an
old-fashioned bungalow shaped
structure, with verandahs all round,
has been enlarged and renovated,
the interior possessing all those
accessories of art, hygiene, and
utility, the sum of which goes to make
up an ideal home. It is lighted by a
modern gas installation, while water
is conveniently distributed over the
house, quarters, outbuildings, yards,
and gardens from an elevated tank
filled by engine power from a bore
which flows past the homestead. The
quarters, too, are of the most
modern and comfortable description,
while the usual outbuildings, which
include a fine motor garage, are
spacious and essentially up-to-date.
Rustic bridges artistically placed,
rose gardens resplendent with
blooms, citrus trees, shrubs, bamboos,
acacias and other ornamental
growths, which spread themselves
umbrella fashion as shelter from the
northern sun, beautify the grounds
in the vicinity of the house, the sight
of which is an oasis to the tired
traveller, while other evidence of the
love of the beautiful possessed by the
host and hostess of “Antrim” lies
within the bush houses and is
expressed by the many choice plants
and ferns which are there to receive
careful attendance. That freely
accorded hospitality for which the old
pastoral homes were so widely known
is heartily extended by Mr. Peel to
the guests of “Antrim” and charm-
ingly dispensed by its hostess. Ever
a prominent participant in the public
life of the district wherein his inter-
ests are centred, Mr. Peel has never
failed to do all in his power to assist
those movements instituted for the
general good. For the past twelve
years he has been a member of ohe
Flinders Shire Council and at time
of writing is a member of the
Hughenden Marsupial Board. An
enthusiastic lover of the equine and
a keen judge of a good horse, he
naturally takes an active interest in
the sport of Kings, being president
of the Hughenden Jockey Club and
a member of the Townsville, Charters
Towers, and the various racing clubs
of Northern Queensland, while he is
also included in the members’ lists of
the Australian Jockey Club and
Queensland Turf Club. He has one
good horse and sometimes more carry-
ing silk, Ills success in the past in this
regard being marked by many fine
wins. At time of writing he is racing
some of the horses bred on “Antrim”
and has in training “Antrim King”
by “Royal Eagle,” “Spin” by
"George Frederick,” the dam having
two crosses of “Musket Blood,” and
giving great promise for the future
of her progeny. Mr. Peel is a
member of the Flinders Club,

THOMAS STEWART BYRNE
TERRY, “Limbri Downs,” Hughen-
den, was born at “Eton Vale,” a
pastoral holding situated in the
vicinity of Bowen, on December 29,
MR. A. J. M. TERRY.
1877. He is the eldest son of Mr.
Alexander Joseph MacDonald Terry,
one of the oldest and most favourably
known pastoralists of the Northern
State, whose career provides a record
MR. H. H. BARTON.
which entitles him to be classed
among the country’s most enterpris-
ing pioneers. The son of a pioneer
and a member of the family which
has been identified with the staple
industry of Australia practically
since its foundation, Mr. A. J. M.
Terry was born in New South Wales
in the year 1849, his father, the late
Thomas Terry, having been the
original owner of “Howlong”
Station, N.S.W.—an historical fact
which expresses more vividly than
would be possible in words the con-
nection of the Terry family with the
early history-making of the country.
At a period dating more than fifty
years back, when the pastoral possi-
bilities of Queensland were being
fully recognized and put to the test
by the more progressive and enter-
prising spirits of the age, Mr. Terry,
sen., then at the age of fifteen, set
out for the north in order to join his
maternal uncle, the late P. F.
Macdonald, at “Yaamba,” a well-
known station situated near Rock-
hanpoton, which with other properties
was originally taken up by that
gentleman in the fifties and retained
by him up to the time of his death
in the year 1919. He remained in
the service of Mr. P. F. Macdonald
for about seven years, managing
“Fernlees”—a property situated
between Springsure and Emerald,
and also included in his uncle’s
ownership—for a portion of that
period during which he gained much
of the knowledge which was so
successfully applied to various
ventures of a similar description
subsequently undertaken on his own
behalf. His earliest independent
essay as a pastoralist was made in the
year 1870, when he took up “Eton
Vale,” one of the first station
properties founded in the vicinity of
Bowen, which he developed and
improved as a cattle proposition. He
carried on at “Eton Vale” for about
twelve years, until 1882, when he sold
the property to Mr. James A. Page,
and embarked upon a fresh enter-
prise, purchasing “Blenheim,” a
station situated on the western edge
of the Bowen district. Disposing of
the last-mentioned concern in 1885
he retired from active business pur-
suits for a few years, but, wearying
of inaction and urged by that
pioneering spirit which was so strong
within him, and the appeal of the
wide spaces of his native land, he
again entered the industry, taking up
80,000 acres of country in the North
Kennedy district, forming “Kirknie”
Station. In 1910 “Kirknie ” was
sold and Mr. A. J. M. Terry again
went into retirement for a brief
period, though retaining pastoral
interests in partnership with one of
his sons. The year 1914, however,
witnessed his re-entry into the in-
dustry in an administrative capacity

as the result of his purchase of
“Inkerman” Station from Mr. A. J.
Cotton, and for practically the whole
period intervening since his acquire-
ment of the proposition, he has been
MR. B. J. MACKAY.
engaged in controlling the operations
conducted thereon. He married
Rose, daughter of the late Michael
Byrne, of Campbelltown, New South
Wales, who, having been closely


associated with the grazing and
agricultural interests of the district
for a number of years, was regarded
as one of the identities of that centre.
Of the union there is a family of
three sons and four daughters, the
eldest son being resident at “Limbri
Downs,” while the second,
Alexander James Staines Byrne
Terry, is engaged in grazing opera-
tions as the owner of “Keengea” and
“Dalmuir,” near Hughenden. The
third son, Mr. L. V. B. Terry,
follows the industry on his property
“Strathbyrne,” which is situated in
the vicinity of Cloncurry. Of Mr.
Terry’s daughters, one resides with
him at “Inkerman,” the remaining
three having married, being Mrs.
Abbott, of “Elma Grove,” Mrs. F.
D. R. Grant, and Mrs. Arthur
Keogh. Mr. T. S. B. Terry was
educated in Bowen, concluding his
scholastic course before entering his
teens in order to assist his father in
the work at “Kirknie.” Here he
became familiar with the various
details of station routine, and, at an
age when the interests of youth are
usually divided between books and
field sports, he and his brothers were
engaged in what was practically con-
sidered men’s work on the paternal
acres, which, owing to the excessively
low price of cattle at that time, it
was necessary to run with the
smallest possible expenditure. The
knowledge thus acquired, however,
proved a valuable acquisition in after
years, and by the time he had reached
his seventeenth year, he had become
one of the best-known drovers in the
West, travelling stock under con-
tract from the Gulf country to the
Southern Queensland border on
behalf of the Bank of New South
Wales and other pastoral owners,
while making “Kirknie” his head-
quarters. In his early twenties he
was sent on a visit of inspection to
“Arafura” Station, in the Northern
Territory, by the Eastern and
African Cold Storage Company, who
wished to obtain first-hand advice as
to the suitability of the area for their
purposes. On his statement (which
has been borne out by subsequent
events and by the fact that the area
is no longer used as a pastoral hold-
ing) all the live stock were disposed
of in Queensland and the country
forfeited to the Crown. In 1905 Mr.
Terry and his brother, Mr. A. J. S.
B. Terry, took up country on the
Burdekin River, and formed “Byrne

Valley” Station, stocking the run
with cattle and administering it
jointly for five years. At the end
of that period the elder brother pur-
chased his partner’s interests in the
station and continued as sole owner
Hugbenden on the Winton line, and
comprises about 29,000 acres of
exceptionally fine grazing country,
characterized by chocolate plains
lightly timbered with gidya, boree,
and whitewood, and a border of
strain thus kept up to a high stan-
dard, which is evidenced in the type
of sheep and wool produced on
“Limbri Downs.” A milking herd
of cattle is also depastured on the
run. The homestead, which was
until 1913, when he disposed of
"Byrne Valley” with the view of
investing in a sheep proposition, pur-
chasing "Enryb Downs” from his
father and former partner (Mr. A.
J. S. B. Terry) in the same year. He
vigorously pushed forward the
development already inaugurated on
that property and made extensive
improvements, particularly in regard
to building and subdivisional opera-
tions during his residence as owner.

coolibah along the banks of the
creeks. A luxuriant growth of
Mitchell, Flinders, and barley grasses
is in evidence, though in season many
other varieties of grass and herbage
prevail, and among other noticeable
features indicating the character of
the run are frequently occurring
pebbly and stony ridges. Since Mr.
Terry’s advent to “Limbri Downs”
an energetic and extensive system of
development has been carried on, the
erected by the previous owner,
occupies a site in the midst of a belt
of sheltering gidya lying some 26
miles from Hugbenden and half a
mile from the Warianna Siding,
on the Winton railway line. It is an
up-to-date, well-built, deep-veran-
dahed, and roomy structure,
designed with a view of fulfilling all
requirements of a pastoral home in
regard to comfort, convenience,
ventilation, etc. Towards the latter
In 1915 he parted with “Enryb
Downs” as the result of a satisfactory
offer, and a week later was actively
engaged in initiating a system of
development on “Limbri Downs,”
which he purchased from Mr. A. P.
Barnes, by whom it was originally
selected in the year 1911 as a
resumed portion of the well-known
“Afton Downs” Station. _ “Limbri

improvements now existing including
both an artesian and sub-artesian
bore, while further operations in this
direction are in course of progress,
and will result in the provision of an
additional bore on the property. The
flock averages about 12,000, which
was founded on “Bundoran” and
“Cooinda” ewes. “ITaddon Rig” rams
have since been introduced from the
well-known stud so named, and the
end of the year 1919 Mr. Terry
added to his pastoral interests by the
purchase of "Saranac,” a property of
some 20,000 acres situated at a dis-
tance of between ten and twelve
miles from ‘‘Limbri Downs,” and
only five miles from Stamford.
‘ Saranac” was originally a resumed
portion of “Katandra,” and partakes
of the quality of soil and pasturage
for which that well-known station is


noted—it being hardly second to
“Afton Downs” in this respect—and
is also a well-developed block. The
features characterizing the run are
similar to those prevailing on
verdure formed by the successful
cultivation of flower and fruit
gardens, many different kinds of
citrus and other fruit trees adding a
charm of their own and providing
his efforts on behalf of that town and
its community, to the interests of
which he devoted himself with energy
and whole-heartedness. Some time
after the death of his first wife, Mr.

Terry is keenly interested in the
industry, with which he has been
associated during the whole of his
life, devoting his time and attention
to the successful handling of such
projects that he may have in hand

is a member of the National Associa-
tion, Brisbane. He has been twice
married, bn the first occasion to a
daughter of the late Hugh Hawthorn
Terry married Leona Frances,
daughter of the late Bernard Joseph
Mackay, of "Thornhill,” Harris-
ville, the second union occurring in
the year 1918. Mr. B. J. Mackay
was born in Queensland over sixty
years ago, and is the son of the late
Hugh Mackay, who, hailing from the
Isle of “Saints and Scholars,” arrived
in New South Wales during the first
days of settlement in the then
Colony, and amongst the early

on the more recently acquired
property, is superior to that now

association with the mining industry

whose public-spirited qualities are

has a family of three sons, two of
whom were born of the earlier union.


WILLIAM HAMMOND, J.P.,

born near the town of Boston, in
Lincolnshire, England, on May 11,
1861. He is the eldest son of the

of an old Lincolnshire family,
members of which were occupied
with landed pursuits in that County
during many generations, devoting
their acres to grazing pursuits and
the breeding of both sheep and

siderable portion of which was later
resumed by the Government of the

Many of the blocks that were nearest
to Hughenden were never taken up,
however, being too limited in area
for the purpose of those desiring to
settle on the land, and in conse-
quence several of these leases were
repurchased by the owners of “Afton
Downs,” their acquirement increas-
ing the area under the control of
Mr. Hammond back again to some
320.000 acres. Since his advent
thereto the estate has steadily and
markedly progressed in all depart-
ments of pastoral enterprise, and to
his efforts is due the high place
which it takes amongst neighbouring
propositions of a similar description.
The area is devoted to wool-raising
principally, though a stud shorthorn
herd proves a most successful side
issue without incommoding the main
industry. The shorthorns bred in
the “Afton Downs” stud are well
deserving of the enviable reputation
which they have achieved amongst
the cattlemen of Northern and
Western Queensland as a result of
the methods employed by Mr.
Hammond. The care which he has
observed in perfecting this branch of
the operations which he controls has
produced a fidelity to type which is
marked by the prices easily obtained
for herd and stud bulls, the former
bringing on an average forty
guineas, while the latter are sold
for prices up to three figures, the
high standard of the herd being the
locally known as “Jellicoe,” a sire of
exceptional merit, bred in Victoria
by Sir Rupert Clarke, and for some
time used in the famous “Lancefield”
stud. The original dams were bred
from the “Corinda” stud herd, half
of which found its way to “Afton

“Glendower” Station, near Prairie,
who now lives in retirement at
Emu Park, a seaside resort in the
vicinity of Rockhampton. Mr. Coxon,
sen., retains his association with the
Whitewood, as well as of other
pastoral interests. The Coxon family
is of British origin, having been
founded in Australia in the fifties by
the late George Coxon—the grand-
father of the subject of this article—
a native of Newcastle-on-Tyne,
England, a detailed account of whose
career appears elsewhere in this
work. Mr. William Coxon was a
student at the Rockhampton
Grammar School, at which institution
he completed his scholastic career,
Avhen he immediately returned to the
former home of the family on “Fair-
field” Station. He there made his
entry into the industry with which
his immediate progenitors and other
relatives were so long and closely
identified, spending the ensuing four
years of his life in active participa-
tion of the work on the paternal
acres and in equipping himself under
the advice and tuition of his father
with the experimental knowledge
necessary for the prosecution of an
independent enterprise. So successful
was he in the attainment of this
objective that, at the termination of
the above-mentioned period, he
launched out in the purchase of
“Artesian Downs,” a property
situated near Richmond, which he
administered for about two years,
completing a large amount of
developmental work during that
Ilfracombe, and included in his
father’s ownership. The duties
connected with this position occupied
his energies until 1910, in which year
he again embarked on an independent

duties occupied his time until,
impressed by the need for men to
carry on the titanic struggle in which
the Empire was then engaged, he
volunteered for active service, his
conviction that it was the duty of
every man to offer the best that was
in him during that momentous crisis
of our history, being upheld by a
helpmeet whose courage was equal to
her patriotism. He embarked for
England in September, 1916, and on
arrival was attached to the Transport
in the United Kingdom, in which
service he was engaged almost to
the end of hostilities, being invalided
to Australia as a result of a
breakdown in health, a short time
previous to the signing of the
armistice. A period of convalescence
followed his home-coming, during
which he was gradually restored to
his former health, and towards the
latter end of 1919, he associated
himself once more with the pastoral
life of the State, purchasing “Spring
Valley,” a property adjoining
“Fairlight” Station, of which it
originally formed a part. “Spring
Valley,” which is situated some 30
miles from Hughenden, is subdivided
into twelve paddocks of varying sizes,
and is devoted to horned stock, a
good type of shorthorn being
depastured. It embraces about
40,000 acres of country, being
provided with several natural springs
—a circumstance from which the
property derives its name—two
artesian and two sub-artesian bores,
and is reputed to be one of the best
watered areas on the Flinders. The

vicinity of the house have been
planted with a variety of shrubs and

homeliness which so materially adds
to the desirableness of a bush home.
Mr. W. G. Coxon is a keen advocate
of all kinds of outdoor sport, and
accords his patronage to the various
bodies instituted to this end; he
is a good shot with rifle or gun,
and, to a moderate extent, a
supporter of the sport of Kings. Duly
participating in public life, he
identifies himself with all movements
having for their object the advance-
ment of Northern and Western
Queensland. He is a member of the
Commercial Travellers’ Association,
Brisbane, North Queensland, and
Townsville Clubs, and the Flinders
Club, Hughenden. In the year 1910
he married Edith May, daughter of
Mr. Alfred William Palmer, who,
hailing originally from England,
became one of the pioneers of
commerce in Queensland, and was for
many years a well-known wine and
spirit merchant in Rockhampton. He
comes of a Staffordshire family which
has contributed during different
generations of its history representa-
tives to various branches of pro-
fessional activities, one of his
progenitors having attained high

CHARLES JOHN BURDEKIN
ABBOTT, J.P., “Abbotsford,”
Stamford, Northern Queensland, was
born at Charters Towers on
February 8, 1878, and is the younger
MR. J. T. ABBOTT.
son of the late John Thomas Abbott,
a native of Maitland, New South
Wales, and a member of one of the
oldest of the pioneer families whose
initiative and enterprise was
responsible for the early establish-
ment and development of the great
pastoral industry in Australia. For
a period bordering on 100 years this
well-known family was identified
with farming, grazing, and stock-
raising pursuits on the Hunter River.
It has also been prominently
represented in the political arena in
the person of the late Sir Joseph
Abbott, at one time Speaker of the
New South Wales Parliament.
Tracing its history back through the
past century, we find that the
founder of the branch now
represented at “Abbotsford,” the
late Neville Abbott, hailed from
Ireland as one of the earliest
colonists attracted hither by the
establishment of free settlement in
the parent State, when men of
fearless nature with a strength of
character and physique capable of
coping with the often fearful odds
and bitter experiences incidental to
colonization at that era were
imperatively needed to lay the
foundations of national existence. At
his death the late Neville Abbott
left a family of three sons and four
daughters, the father of the gentle-
man under review, the late John
Thomas Abbott, being the second
son. He and his brother, Henry,
elected to throw in their lot with the
destinies of the North, the latter,
who now lives in retirement in
Townsville, having been identified
with “Fanning River,” a pastoral
proposition in the North Kennedy
district, as managing owner for a
period of thirty-five years. On taking
up “Fanning River,” Mr. H. Abbott
overlanded his cattle and horses from
“Lake Clarendon,” a property
situated in Southern Queensland.
The late John Thomas Abbott arrived
in that portion of the Continent
which is now the thriving State of
MR. C. J. B. ABBOTT.
Queensland in the early thirties, and
is recorded as having formed
“Waverley” Station, and managed
various pastoral properties for the
late Duncan Mackie. He was also
associated, as owner, with “Elma
Grove” Station on the Herbert River
for some time, at a period dating
thirty years back. He married
Margaret Jane Finch, the daughter
of an old Queensland pastoralist of
the early days, who also hailed from
the Maitland district, New South
Wales, and of the union there was
a family of two sons and two
daughters, the elder, Albert Henry
Abbott, being now interested
in sugar-growing outside Ingham,
and well known also as a grazier and
a breeder of red polled cattle. Mr.
C. J. B. Abbott received his educa-
tion by private tuition under the
jiarental roof, his studies being
varied with practical experience of
the various details included in the
routine of a pastoral proposition. At
an early age he was requisitioned for
stock work, obtaining his first real
grounding in the industry under his
father’s supervision. On his attain-
ment to the age of eighteen, he
accepted a post under his uncle, Mr.
Henry Abbott, at “Fanning River”
Station, carrying out the duties
assigned to him during the remain-
ing six years of that gentleman’s
ownership of the property, and,
subsequently, when it was sold to
the Queensland National Bank,
Ltd., taking over the reins of control
on behalf of that institution. After
a period he relinquished his position
in order to interest himself, in
partnership with his brother, in a
cattle venture in the Ingham district,
to which locality he then proceeded.
The connection was mutually dis-
solved in the year 1910, when the
subject of our memoir moved to
Charters Towers, where he lived in
partial retirement until that portion
of old “Katandra” Station which
included his present country, was
thrown open for selection. Being
successful in his application for the

block, he entered into possession in
the year 1912, and has since been
actively engaged in carrying out
various developmental operations,
the only improvements previously


Existing on the property being a
portion of fencing and an artesian
bore. Mr. Abbott’s efforts have been
directed to such purpose, however,
that the property, on which he
bestowed the title of “Abbotsford,”
is now one of the most advanced
propositions of its kind in the
district. It embraces over 20,000
acres of particularly fine grazing
country, the nature of which is
indicated by rolling downs well
covered with Mitchell and Flinders
grasses, and occasional whitewood
property for a distance of seven
miles, and provides deep holes which
are full for the major portion
of the year. The dwelling, which is
situated thirteen miles from the
Stamford Railway Station, is
furnished with wide verandahs and
well ventilated rooms. It was
originally a modern Charters Towers
home, having been purchased and re-
erected on the property by Mr.
Abbott. In its design are successfully
combined a display of excellent taste
and those features of comfort and
“Abbotsford” being in excess of the
needs of the property. Mr. Abbott
received the Commission of the Peace
in the year 1914. He is a member
of the Civic Club, Charters Towers,
the Flinders Club, Hughenden, and
of the North Queensland Pastoralists’
and Graziers’ Association. A
supporter of clean amateur sport, he
is included in the membership of the
Tower Hill Picnic Race Club. In
the year 1911 he married Beatrice
Catherine, daughter of the late
Edwin Harrison, who was for many
and vinetree growths, the shelter of
which proves a boon to the stock.
The run is also lightly timbered on
the creeks. Subdivision into three
paddocks and a horse paddock has
been effected, two of the lesser
enclosures consisting of 5,000 acres
each, while the third covers an
acreage of 10,000. The main water
supply is received from the bore
already mentioned, which was put
down to a depth of 2,700 feet by the
former owners, a further source
being afforded by Sloane Creek,
which wends its way through the

convenience calculated to cope with
climatic conditions. The grounds in
the vicinity of the house bear out
the impression conveyed by the
homestead, a charming effect being
produced by the arrangement of the
garden, in which roses and other
blossoms amply repay the careful
tendance they have received, while

subject of this memoir was born on
February 11, 1874. The late G. A.

well known as a veterinarian, rank-
ing as one of the most successful
members of the profession in
Scotland at that time. When in
middle life, the late gentleman

able prominence also among horse
breeders and importers of equine
stock on account of his own
operations in this direction which
included the importation of some of
the finest types of Clydesdale breed
brought into the country up to that
time. He is recorded as being
largely instrumental in effecting the
removal of the importation tax on
blood stock, being the leader of a
movement instituted to this end. His
death occurred in America, where he
founded a family which continues to
flourish under the protection of the
Stars and Stripes, his second son
being the only member to strike out
in a younger land. On the conclusion
of his education, which he pursued
at Emmetsburg, lowa, Mr. D. W.
Hardie chose the land of the
Southern Cross as the scene of his
future life, and accordingly set out
to join his maternal uncle, Mr.
David Watt, who at that time was
engaged in the pastoral industry at
"Riverdale,” a well-known station
property situated on the Murray
River. The year 1892 marked his
arrival at "Riverdale,” where he
remained for about twelve months
gaining a good insight into the work-
ings of a grazing proposition during
that period. Subsequently, he
accepted a post on "Pan ar ami tee”
Station, near Broken Hill, where he
enlarged his experience of the
industry and the conditions under
which it was conducted, and after a
management of “Pinkilla,” a station
situated in Western Queensland in

Northern State, being moved to this
resolve by the action of his uncle
who disposed of his South Australian
interests and entered upon the
this end. On leaving “Pinkilla,” he
entered the sugar-growing industry,
securing a post at a mill near Bun-
daberg, the duties of which occupied
him for a season. Attracted by the


possibilities of gold-mining which
promised more rapid achievement of
the success at which he aimed than
the grazing industry under condi-
tions he had lately abandoned, he
proceeded to Charters Towers, arriv-
ing at that field in the year 1896,
at the period when cyaniding was at
its zenith. Taking a temporary post
he set himself to the task of attain-
ing proficiency in that department
of mining operations, his efforts
resulting in his appointment to a
responsible position in the Brilliant
and St. George Cyanide Works,
where he was placed in charge of the
chemical operations dealing with the
devoting a whole-hearted energy
coupled with the knowledge gained
under adverse conditions in earlier
days to the successful conduct
of the enterprise, the initial stages
of its development being accompanied
by the hardships incidental to the
formation of a pastoral home. At
the end of a year, however, he had
his Charters Towers home (which he
had occupied for over a decade and
in which his children were born) re-
moved to a position on the property
within sight of the Stamford Rail-
way Station, and the town so named
being the chief pastoral centre of
the locality, “Malakoff Downs” soon

would otherwise have found it
difficult to procure water until

was completed. The run, which
consists of 21,000 acres, is composed

grasses, a light growth of timber
fringing the creeks. Merinos com-

on behalf of the Brilliant and St.

pied a period of twelve years. When
the gold-mining industry in Charters

to embark on a pastoral venture and
with this intention journeyed further
west. Shortly afterwards he bal-
loted for and was successful in
obtaining the block which comprises
“Malakoff Downs,” which formerly
was part of “Katandra” Station,
and in the year 1912 settled on his

NORMAN WYLIE PHILP,
“Stanley Downs/’ Stamford, North-
ern Queensland, was born at Towns-
ville, on August 16, 1882. He is the
second son of the late John Philp,
MR. J. PHILP.
who, with his younger brother (after-
wards Sir Robert Philp, K.C.M.G.,
and one of the most prominent Par-
liamentarians of the State), and sister
(now Mrs. R. E. Donaldson) accom-
panied his parents from Scotland to
Queensland in the year 1862. The
founder of the Philp connection in
Australia was a scion of a very anci-
ent Scottish family which was estab-
lished in Fifeshire, at a period dating
many hundreds of years back and
which formerly owned large landed
estates in that County, their posses-
sions, from very early times, includ-
ing the Barony of Kippo and large
properties at Lindores (Lundorus),
Newburgh, Balgonie, and Borriehoill
(Boar Hill), the last-mentioned re-
maining in the family up to the end
of the eighteenth or beginning of the
nineteenth century. Various docu-
mentary records, some of which are
included in the “Registrum Sigilli
Regum Scotorum” provide interest-
ing details relating to its history and
traditions. These records lead to the
assumption that the family origin-
ated in the prehistoric era of Scottish
history, and tradition claims that it
was represented at Bannockburn
under King Robert Bruce, while
archives of a later period show that
a Philp occupied the office of Cham-
berlain to King David Bruce. We
read that the line has contributed
during the past 500 years repre-
sentatives of the municipal and
County government, the law, medi-
cine, and the Church in Fifeshire,
one of its members, John Philp,
having been Abbot of Lindores in
the immediate pre-reformation days.
A Philp at one time held the post of
Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland, and another, military com-
mand in the North of Ireland in the
reign of James I. and VI. Another
of that name, Dr. Henry (or
Henricus) Philp was prominently
identified with the early establish-
ment of the Protestant Church, and
was the first Divine of the Church of
Scotland to receive the degree of
Doctor of Divinity. A monument
has been erected in his parish of
MR. N. W. PHILP.
Arbroath in memory of this gentle-
man, whose son is recorded as bearer
of the standard of Claverhouse at
the battle of Killiecrankie. Among
the many members of the family who
stood fast to the earlier Church,
suffering persecution, banishment
and the lose of their estates for their
fealty, was one Philp, a lengthy
account of whose trait for “harbour-
ing Jesuits” may be read among the
judicial archives of the time. In
regard to local government, records
show that Simpson Philp was Pro-
curator-Fiscal of Fife as late as the
seventies of the last century.
Another Philp, Hugh, has been
described as the “Stradivarius of
Golf,” so well known is his name
in connection with the ancient
manufacture of the golf clubs. The
name crops up again in the manufac-
ture of whiskey according to Scotch
method in Dublin in the eighteenth
century, in which enterprise certain
of the Philp family were associated
with the original John Jamieson. In
records of the previous century, it is
stated that the family were concerned
in the colonization of the North of
Ireland. Other interesting matter
relating to the family is contained
in vol. I. of this work in an article
dealing with the life of Mr. C. J. C.
Philp, of “Wyaralong” Station, a
cousin of the subject of this memoir.
On his advent to the land of the
Southern Cross, being then at the
age of sixteen, the late John Philp
entered the telegraphic branch of the
Public Service in Brisbane, and in
later years was well known as the
post and telegraph master at War-
wick, St. Lawrence, and Gladstone.
Eventually he severed his connection
with the Government, and in
partnership with Mr. Thomas Hollis
Hopkins established the highly-
reputed Townsville firm known as
Hollis Hopkins & Co., Ltd., in the
business of which he actively partici-
pated until the time of his death,
which occurred in January, 1910.
He was survived by a widow, four
sons and a daughter, the eldest
son, John Macdiarmid, being now

pursued his scholastic studies at the
Townsville Grammar School, and
subseqnently entered upon a three
years’ course at the Queensland
Agricultural College, Gatton. Leav-
ing that institution in 1899, he
immediately embarked upon a
career of agriculture, taking up
farming land in the Fassifern
district which he worked for the
following fourteen years. At the
resumed portion of “Katandra”
Station lying in the vicinity of
Stamford, in 1912. In the following
year he disposed of his farming
interests and entered upon the
administration of his northern
property, to the development of
which he has since actively applied
himself. Under his regime an
artesian bore has been sunk and
other developmental work, including
some 60 miles of fencing completed.

the homestead is situated at a dis-
tance of 12 miles, is considered a
highly desirable proposition. The
country is devoted principally to a
merino flock averaging a strength of
about 10,000 originally founded on
good blood and since kept up to the
required standard by the importa-
tion of rams from the South. A
small herd of red polled cattle is
also carried. Draught horses are
raised on the area both to supply
the needs of the place and the con-
stant demand for good types of
heavy horses, the sire used for the
purpose being “Prince Charlie,”
which was bred from highly-pedigreed
stock by Mr. Thompson, of “Mount
Emu.” Like many other grazing
homesteads in the West, the dwell-
ing now standing on “Stanley
Downs” was originally erected in
Charters Towers, and removed to its
present site by Mr. Philp on his
acquirement of the holding. It is a
modern home fulfilling all require-
ments in regard to comfort, ventila-
tion, etc., and admirably adapted to
the climate. Mr. Philp married in
the year 1906 Sophia, daughter of
Mr. Alexander Hunter, one of the
oldest pioneers of the West Moreton
district. A descendant of an old
Scottish agrarian family of Stirling-
shire, Mr. Hunter has spent about
three quarters of a century in
Queensland, and has proved a worthy
compatriot of those who forsaking
“the land of brown heath and shaggy
wood” have assisted so materially in

ing the larger possibilities of pastoral

with the Australian Imperial Forces
abroad. It is admirably situated
situation, and the high stage of
development now existing within its
boundaries cause it to rank as one
of the most desirable and up-to-date
pastoral propositions in the North-
west. Over 50,000 acres, two-thirds
of which are composed of beautiful
Mitchell grass downs, the remainder
carrying a growth of scrub, the
predominant varieties of which are
edible and highly nutritious to stock,
comprise the “Runnymede” pas-
tures. The run has been subdivided
into fifteen paddocks of dimensions
varying from 1,000 to 5,000 acres,
these being watered by two bores
which feed drains extending over
some 50 miles of country. Modern
and scientific methods such as
have always characterized the pas-
toral operations of the Wharton
family have been applied with the
most satisfactory results in the
building up of the “Runnymede”
flock, which, founded on “Wan-
ganella” blood, is kept true to type
by the importation of rams from the
“Boonoke” and other famous South-
ern studs. The country being
adaptable for either class of stock,
a herd of shorthorns is depastured
on those portions of the run most
with the view of increasing the
carrying capacity of the run.

on the edge of far-reaching downs
and backed by a belt of timber, the
plains and timbered country merging
into grounds beautified with well-
grown shade trees, shrubbery, garden
plots and lawns. A large canal-like
stream, the source of which is an
artesian bore, situated only a few
yards from the homestead, flows
through the garden and adds
uniquely to the charm of the sur-
roundings. In keeping with the dwell-

where he studied until reaching the
age of fourteen. He was then sent
to the famous King’s School at
Parramatta, and pursued his studies
at this institution for five years under
the supervision of the Rev. A. H.
Champion and Rev. Stacey Waddy.
On terminating his school career he
returned to the North, and proceeding
to “Strathmore, "a large cattle station
held by Mr. A. H. W. Cunningham,

Wharton family, further familiar-
izing him with the best methods of
handling stock in the ordinary
routine of pastoral operations and
also on the roads. Subsequently,
realizing that his equipment for the
great industry which has such scope
for expansion in this State would
be incomplete without an intimate
knowledge of sheep, he decided to
accept the opportunity of gaining
orderliness so markedly apparent in
all departments of this up-to-date
proposition. Mr. Frederick Mat-
thew Wharton was born at Bowen,
Northern Queensland, on August 23,
1890. He is a son of Mr. William
Thomas Wharton, an account of
whose career will be found in
another portion of this work. At
the time of his birth his parents
resided permanently in the North,

station situated in the North Ken-
nedy district, and still included in
the family ownership. His earlier

grounding in the business to which,
in pursuance of family traditions, he
intended to devote his future life.
After a year’s study of the many
details connected with the working of
an important cattle concern, he, in
1909, removed to “Birralee,” and
for some time filled the post of head
stockman on that property, which
was then managed on his father’s
behalf by his eldest brother. From
“Birralee," acting on the advice of
his father, he went to the Burke
district, with the view of obtaining
the experience he wished by joining
the staff of “Kynuna" Station, a
large wool and mutton proposition
near Winton, in the North Gregory
district. “Kynuna” was then
managed by Mr. L. G. Reid, an
expert in all phases of the sheep
industry, whose methods were
readily grasped and assimilated by
Mr. Wharton during the period of
nearly two years which followed his
advent to the property. Thus
equipped with the experience essen-
tial for the successful conduct of
a sheep proposition, on leaving


“Kynuna” he joined Mr. Reginald
Charles Wharton in partnership, the
brothers purchasing, under the title
of Wharton Bros., the area known
as “Kamarooka” Station. The
administration of “Kamarooka”
occupied his energies until the
outbreak of the Great War in
August, 1914, when, upholding the
traditions of a family whose rame
figures both prominently and hon-
ourably in the record of pioneering
achievements in this State, he was
one of the first of our volunteers to
enlist for service at the front.

and finally, in December 1918, he
came back to Australia. A naturally
good constitution quickly responded
to the recuperative influences of rest
and the congenial atmosphere of his
native land, and in the year 1919 he
was sufficiently recovered to enter
upon the administration of “Runny-
mede,” which, as before stated, had
been purchased by his family during
his absence in Europe. The
direction of affairs on this property
has since claimed his chief attention.
He married in December, 1919,

home in Parramatta, from a period
dating nearly half a century back.
Mrs. Wharton is descended on the
maternal side from practically the
oldest pastoral family in Australia,
being a great-grandchild of the
famous John Macarthur, whose
efforts in regard to the introduction
of fine-woolled sheep to Australia,
and the establishment of the great
industry which has become one of
the country’s chief sources of wealth,
have now passed into history, his
experiments in connection with the

Towards the end of 1914 he
embarked with the Australian
Imperial Forces for Egypt, and is
now entitled to wear the distinctive
badge of the Anzacs. After
participating in some minor engage-
ments on the Canal he was trans-
ferred to the larger war theatre of
the Western Front, seeing active
service at Armentieres, Flers, on
the Somme, and at other places
where battles of historic interest
were fought. Eventually he was

Brown was one of the earliest
medical practitioners of New South
Wales, and will be well remembered
by many of a younger generation,
now past their prime, who had the
benefit of his ministrations. He is
recorded as having practised his
great enterprise which, in spite of
immense obstacles and opposition, he
brought to so successful a conclusion,
being initiated as far back as the
latter part of the eighteenth cen-
tury, an interesting account of which
is contained on page 40 of this vol-
ume. Hospitality is the keynote of
the homestead at “Runnymede,”

Mr. Wharton and his young wife in
accordance with the traditions of the
pioneer families to which they owe
their descent.

contracts of the nature which had
formerly occupied their energies.
They made their first speculation in
sheep in the year 1891, when they

purchased and placed on agistment
a flock of 10,000, experiencing
shortly afterwards their share of
the calamities resulting from the
drought which visited the North-
west in the early nineties. Their
long experience of pastoral condi-
tions in the business which had
hitherto absorbed their energies now
stood them in good stead, however,
while their rapidly-completed opera-
tions, resulting in the production
and conservation of water, greatly
mitigated the disaster which
otherwise would have resulted in the
loss of all their stock. “Melrose”
and “Rosevale”—properties pur-
chased within a year of each other
&nd now, as the outcome of a much
later arrangement, solely held by
Mr, James Magoffin, who also owns
“Tonkaro”—were their first landed
ventures. On the acquirement of
these holdings they were overtaken
by the 1900-3 drought, the most
disastrous in our history, the
devastating effect of which was felt
throughout the length and breadth
of the Continent, and in some parts
for a much longer period than above
stated. The effect of this visitation
on the brothers’ big stock
speculations was calamitous, and
they record their losses at this period
as, comparatively speaking, much
greater than any experienced
throughout the whole of their
pastoral career. In the year 1899
Mr. Richard Magoffin took charge
of “Rosevale” and initiated thereon
a system of development, in the
course of which the boundary
fencing was completed, water
conserved for the stock, and a
considerable amount of work
embodied in many other improve-
ments accomplished. He continued
to manage “Rosevale” until 1913,
and in the following year severed his
connection with the firm by mutual
agreement so as to be free to
attend to separate pastoral interests
acquired with the selection of
“Ardbrin,” his present homestead
block, in the year 1909. “Ardbrin”
which is situated in a southerly
direction about thirty-two miles
fiom Nonda siding, on the
Northern Railway line and about
midway between Richmond and
Kynuna, receives its appellation
from the birthplace of the late
Richard Magoffin. At the time of
its acquirement by the subject of
our memoir it consisted of 50,000
acres, but its area has since been
enlarged by the purchase of an
adjoining block of 12,000 acres,
which is used as an outstation and
was originally taken up by his
brother-in-law, the late A. L.
Williams, A.I.F. The country
comprising the two runs is of an
ideal character for grazing purposes,
being composed of rolling downs
which are very lightly timbered
and luxuriantly clothed with
Mitchell and Flinders grasses. Its
natural advantages have been
augmented by extensive improve-
ments, the amalgamated area being
generally regarded as one of the
most highly-developed holdings in
the North-west. Subdivided into
eighteen paddocks with six-wire
sheep-proof fencing the run is
adequately watered by two artesian
bores, the output from which is
conveyed to the stock in drains
which traverse the run for a distance
of 100 miles. The flock, which
averages a strength of about 25,000,
was founded on “Gracedale” ewes
with rams from the well-known
“Urangaline” stud in New South
Wales, a mating which has yielded
highly satisfactory results, though
during the past season the
advisability of a change suggested
the importation of rams from South
Australia with the view of keeping
up the size. This was done, and it
is expected that the high excellence
of wool and constitution which is
now so markedly the possession of
the flock will in the future be the
accompaniment of larger-framed
sheep. In passing we may mention
that during the wool appraisement of
the year 1920, every bale of
fleece wool sent from “Ardbrin”
brought the maximum limit of 48d.
and per lb. The lambing on
this property has always been good,
having reached as high a figure as
70 per cent., though 50 per cent is
the general average. In addition
to the sheep a small dairy herd is
carried, while horses are bred in
sufficient numbers for station use
only. The “Ardbrin” homestead,
which is universally admitted to be
without rival as the most completely
modern pastoral dwelling in


Western Queensland, is in telephonic
communication with Nonda and
Kynuna. Containing eleven large,
lofty, and well-ventilated rooms, the
main building is surrounded by
verandahs twelve feet in width; and
house, offices, shearers’ quarters and
woolshed receive illumination by
means of a Wolseley electric-lighting
system, the plant, which contains
sixty cell storage batteries, being
the largest and most efficient of the
electric installations of any private
pastoral home in Queensland. The
kitchen and quarter's for the staff are
semi-detached from the house proper
and form of themselves a structure
equal in comfort and convenience to
many homesteads in the industry,
while all minor details of improve-
ment such as gates, etc., evidence
the up-to-date administration which
has won for “Ardbrin” the enviable
reputation which it enjoys. In
keeping with the appearance of the
residence are the electrically-lighted
outbuildings, which include a garage,
woolshed, and large open and closed
sheds for the housing of carts,
machinery, etc. The woolshed is
equipped with Burgon head gear and
Wolseley machines driven by an
internal combustion engine, to which
is attached a circular saw that is
utilized for sawing firewood and
other purposes. Now in course of
formation the grounds surrounding
the homestead give promise of
delightful and picturesque results,
and include a tennis court and
flower beds which will shortly add
to the effectiveness already afforded
in the immediate landscape by the
verdure of shade trees and native
shrubs. On the outstation, which
is known as “Sturdee,” there is also
a most comfortable and modern
home, now occupied by Mr. Herbert
J. Williams, a brother-in-law of the
owner, who is in charge of this
portion of the holding. Mr.
Magoffin is a man of many parts.
He accomplished all the survey work
necessitated in the laying of the bore
drains on the property, and so
successful did the system prove that
many owners of surrounding
properties have availed themselves
of his expert knowledge in this
direction. His ingenuity of mind is
also exemplified in various labour-
saving contrivances which he has
completed, one of his inventions
being a combined fire plough and
drain maker which proves ideal for
the work for which it is intended.
He has been frequently approached
with regard to his acceptance of
public positions, but prefers to assist
the progress of the district in an
unostentatious fashion, taking a
prominent part none the less among
leading Westerners in promoting or
assisting any movement tending to
the advancement of the district or
the welfare of his fellow-men. In
the year 1913 he was created a
Justice of the Peace by the Denham
Administration. A lover of good,
clean sport for its own sake and the
honour of manly achievement, he is
a leading spirit in the promotion of
picnic and amateur race meetings in
Western Queensland. For the past
sixteen years he has been president
of the Kynuna Race Club, a body
which conferred on him the honour
of honorary life membership, a
distinction of which he is the sole
recipient. He is a committeeman
of the Clutha Picnic Race Club, also
of the Townsville Amateur Turf
Club, and has been a very successful
owner, the many and valuable
trophies now in his possession
testifying to the numerous occasions
on which his colours have been borne
to victory. Among the horses on
“Ardbrin” which in the past have
achieved distinction on the turf
perhaps none are more worthy of
mention than “Grey Steel,” now a
pensioner on the property, who in
his day was the winner of all the
principal races in the Kynuna
district. “Grey Steel,” who is now
past his twenty-fifth year, was
bred by Mr. John Magoffin, the
brother of the gentleman under

who is a native of Cornwall,
England, and a descendant of old
Celtic lineage, was one of the
earliest residents of Moama, New
South Wales, where for nearly half
a century he has been engaged as an
administrator of the D. and M.
Railway Co. He left England with
the Messrs. Berryman, his maternal
relatives, whose intention was that
he should join them in pastoral
pursuits in South Australia and
New South Wales. On arriving in
Australia, however, believing that
he would do better by launching out
on his own account, he became one
of the original officers employed by
the D. and M. Railway Co. on its
inception, eventually attaining to
the position of responsibility which
he holds to-day. His wife, nee
Miss Hannah Collopy, though a
native of Limerick, Ireland, is a
member of a family which was
established in the Victorian State in
the very early days of settlement in
that part of the Continent, her
parents, who came of old Irish
farming stock, having founded the
line in Australia. Of Mrs. Magoffin’s
family two brothers, the late A. L.
and Mr. H. J. Williams, served
their country during the Great War
of 1914-18 as members of the
Australian Imperial Forces, the
former making the supreme sacrifice
in France in August of the year
1918. Mr. Herbert J. Williams
fought during the operations on
Gallipoli and later in Egypt, and
was twice wounded.
THOMAS ERNEST MACKEN-
ZIE KNOX, “Dimora,” Maxwelton,
was born in Rockhampton on Novem-
ber 12, 1895, and is the only son of
the late Thomas Jackson Knox, a
member of a family which, hailing
originally from Scotland, was estab-
lished in the North of Ireland many
generations ago, settling on the land
in agrarian pursuits. From the time
of their advent to Ireland successive
generations of the Knox family have
occupied and tilled the soil of that
country in the parish of Armoy, near
Ballymoney. Of the branch of the
family there settled two brothers
crossed the seas to the land of the
Southern Cross, one meeting his
death in the Mother State, # shortly
after his arrival, as the result of an
accident. The fine old settler who
identified the name with pastoral
development in Australia was in his
twenties when, impressed by the
potentialities of the newer world, he
severed the ties which bound him to
the land of his forbears and

his ambition well in sight waived
the attractions of the city and
immediately secured a position as
jackaroo on a well-known southern
pastoral property named “Kilfera.”
Here he was initiated into tire many-
sided aspects of station routine, and
by dint of intelligent application
and untiring industry was soon
equipped with a knowledge of pas-
toral work in all its detail which
stood him in good stead in subse-
quent years. He left “Kilfera”
from motives similar to those which
prompted him to try his fortunes in
a country providing greater scope
for enterprising effort than was to
be found in the limited confines of
the Homeland, realizing that the less
thickly settled areas of the Contin-
ent promised a surer materialization
of his pastoral ambition. Imbued
with this conviction, in the late
eighties, within a few years of his
arrival in Australia he journeyed to
Queensland and secured a post on
“Lome,” a pastoral area situated in
the Blackall district, where, with
native ability, he applied himself to
the work assigned to him until very
shortly he was offered and accepted
a more important post on “Eves-
ham, ”a notable property lying in
the vicinity of Longreach. For
twelve years the late T. J. Knox
was well known in his capacity as
manager of “Evesham.” He
resigned the position after a success-
ful period of office in order to
undertake the management of inter-
ests owned by the firm of Francis
Campbell & Co., of Longreach, and
was engaged in carrying out the
duties consequent upon this post for
four years, in the course of which
he acquired pastoral interests on his
own account. His first venture was
the selection of the two blocks near
Maxwelton, on which he bestowed
the name of “Dimora.” Later he
acquired “Struanville,” a freehold
on the Darling Downs, and “Dun-
given,” a pastoral area in the
Charleville district, but subsequently
disposed of both these properties.
Though busily occupied with other
duties he submitted “Dimora” to an
elaborate course of development,
which was persevered with despite
many setbacks experienced through
the divergent causes of bush fires
and floods that in turn devastated
“Dimora” and the surrounding dis-
trict. The knowledge, which as the
outcome of wide pastoral experience,
had rendered him so successful as a
manager for others, however, proved
its efficacy in the administration of
his own holding, which was mostly
effected during frequent visits which
have left their mark in the up-to-date

was educated at the Toowoomba
Grammar School and attended that
academy until arriving at the age
with the industry in the Queen
State, and there, under the direction
of the manager, Mr. T. M. Moore,
engaged in those duties calculated
to fit him for the career which he


intended to follow. While he was
on “Landsdowne” the declaration of
war between Great Britain and
Germany eventuated, a crisis which
caused all thought of self to be
obliterated and impelled him to
tender his loyal service to the cause
of his King and country. He
enlisted with the Australian Imper-
ial Forces when he was twenty, and
as a member of the 7th Battery
Australian Artillery, participated
in the operations conducted in
France until the termination of
hostilities. In the course of the

strenuous experiences in the other

ried Dorothy, second daughter of the
late G. T. Murray, a native of
Liverpool, England, whose vigorous
years of manhood were mainly spent
in Queensland. On arrival in this
State he entered the pastoral
industry, gaining his initial experi-
ence of stock and station work on
“Inverleigh” Station, in the Gulf
country. His later activities were
identified with this district, being
finally centred in Burketown, where

consists of 75,000 acres of Mitchell
and Flinders grass plains, which are
varied with occasional belts of shade
timber, which chiefly fringe the
banks of Campsie and Hamilton
Creeks and other waterways. Though
lacking permanent natural water,
the run is amply provided for in this
respect by two artesian flowing bores
which supply the stock through the
medium of several miles of well-kept
drains. These drains traverse all
the paddocks, twenty in number,

commanded during the appraisement
of 1919. As a side issue to the
main industry, a small herd of
shorthorn cattle is carried, these
being mostly utilized for dairy use.
All the horses required for the sta-
tion are also bred on the property. In
regard to the structural improvements


there is nothing to be desired,
the homestead being well worthy of
description as one of the most
comfortable in this district. Erected
well over ten years ago, it is hardly
as modern in outward appearance
as some of the more imposing
recently-built structures, which in
the North and West vie with the best
pastoral homes in the southern
portion of the State, yet from the
outset it was rendered up-to-date
and convenient in every detail.
Situated at a distance of 45 miles
from Maxwelton, with which centre
it is connected by telephone, it
contains ten well-built and excel-
lently-ventilated rooms which are
provided with illumination by means
of a gas installation, and furnished
to that degree of comfort which
entirely obliviates any drawbacks
incidental to the climate or to
surroundings so far removed from
the busy centres of civilization.
The verandahs enclosing the dwell-
ing and kitchen, offices and staff
quarters, have all been rendered
secure by means of wire-gauze from
fly, mosquito, and other similar pests
which visit the West during certain of
the summer months. Trees of different
varieties planted several years ago,
and now grown to maturity lend a
generous shade to the grounds and
building and add their quota to the
picturesqueness which is a feature of
“Dimora” homestead and its envir-
onment.

MR. ENNIS, SEN.
South Wales, in September of the
year 1855, and is a son of the late
James Daley, a native of County
Cork, Ireland, who arrived in Aus-
tralia in the jmar 1850, drawn
hither by the possibilities of landed
enterprise. The late gentleman
became the owner of freehold coun-
try at the Limekilns, in the vicinity
of Bathurst, for which he paid at
the rate of £5 per acre—an inter-
esting fact in view of present-day
values in the same locality. Sheep
farming in New South Wales occu-
pied him for some time, but his
enterprise was so hampered by low
prices and other adverse conditions
of the period that he failed to win
the success for which he so bravely
foiight. From childhood upwards
Mr. Timothy Daley has had con-
siderable experience in stock. He
assisted the operations of the pioneer
on the home acres until attaining
his twentieth year, when he started
life on his own account as a sheep
drover, and subsequently, having
been familiar with the blades from
boyhood, obtained work as a shearer.
Until the eventuation. of the
drought of 1884 he continued to
engage in bush avocations in New
South Wales, eventually journeying
to Queensland, where he became a
familiar figure at many of the large
shearing sheds of the Northern
State. He was one of the earliest
members of the Queensland Shear-
ers’ Union, and looking back from
the standpoint of a successful pas-
toralist over the long past years to
the days when he was yet at the foot
of the ladder, is of opinion that the
general conditions of the time neces-
sitated the existence of such a body

to safeguard the interests of the
shearers. In his early Queensland
days he carried out several contracts
for fencing and other developmental
operations on different large pastoral
areas, being associated in this way
with the staple industry of the
State until the discovery of the
Croydon goldfields in 1888. He
spent about two years on these
diggings, suffering the hardships
and sacrifices that are invariably
the lot of the pioneer, especially
under the climatic conditions of the
Far North, with but little financial
return, and in 1890, on contracting
the fever that is so prevalent in
newly-opened country, decided to
abandon mining and start in the
carrying trade with Hughenden as
his headquarters. Some years later
he acquired one of two adjoining
grazing blocks in the district outly-
ing the town of Richmond, the other
having been taken up by Mr. Will-
iam Ennis at about the same time.
In 1899 Messrs. Daley and Ennis
amalgamated their interests and
formed a partnership, naming their
consolidated property “Poverty
Point,” and while getting in hand
the necessary development jointly
continued their carrying operations,
having at this time four teams on
the roads. Their landed venture
promised to turn out disastrously
at the outset, as, after buying 4,000
wethers when wool was at boom

stock by depasturing them on relief

“Harrowgate” clip is one of the
best-known clips grown in that fine
wool-growing district. Later they
extended the scope of their opera-
tions still further by purchasing
additional interests. “Blantyre,” in
the Prairie district, became included
in the firm’s ownership in the year
1912, since when Mr. Ennis has
resided on this property as managing
partner, Mr. Daley continuing to
direct operations on their earlier
acquirements. The runs are worked
under joint administration and
aggregate some 150,000 acres of good
grazing country which is devoted to
sheep, cattle, and horses. Both
flocks and herds display the qualities
of well-bred sires, the rams being
chiefly imported from leading South
Australian stud flocks. The wool
grown by Messrs. Daley & Ennis
realizes the fullest values in the
various grades and speaks well for
the country on which it is produced
and for the methods adopted by the
owners. Having a penchant for
good horses of the heavier breeds,
the partners import stallions of the
highest quality from the South, with
the result that the stamp of Clydes-
dale bred at “Poverty Point” and
“Blantyre” is unrivalled in the
North. The “Poverty Point” pro-

properties in the North and the

comfortable, homely, and pictur-
esquely-designed structure, the


dwelling is surrounded by ornamen-
tal trees and shrubs, through the foli-
age of which are disclosed many
ideal pastoral views. Mr. Daley is
interested in sport and is a member
of the local amateur racing clubs.
He is on the members’ list of the
Hughenden Pastoral and Agricul-
tural Association. Under the Kid-
son-Morgan Administration of 1903
he was created a Justice of the
Peace.
Than WILLIAM ENNIS, few
have played a more strenuous part
in connection with the pioneering of
the empty spaces of this vast con-
tinent. Born at St. Kilda, Victoria,
on April 6, 1858, Mr. Ennis was
little more than a child when he took
on shepherding in his native State,
receiving remuneration for his work
at the rate of ss. a week, or, in lieu
of that amount, a sheep for killing.
His first step in the direction of
independence was the acquirement
of a small plant with which he went
tank sinking on “Pericoota” Sta-
tion, New South Wales. Subse-
quently he travelled with his outfit
to “Wooroma,” where he started
similar operations on behalf of Mr.
Lachlan Mcßean. By thrift and a
considerable amount of self-sacrifice,
he saved a little from the money
earned by his contracts, and with
the intention of selecting land in the
Gippsland district brought the first
dray from the head of the Ovens
River to the Dargo, all carrying
hereabouts having hitherto been
done by pack horse. His vehicle
caused as much sensation among the
children of the settlements dotted
over the route as the arrival of an
aeroplane would in some of the out-
back districts to-day. He and three
men who were with him had an
eventful journey, at one ‘point of
which they were taken for bush-
rangers owing to the circumstance of
their having passed through Jeril-
derie just after the notorious Kelly
gang had left there with £2,000
taken from the bank. This gang
(after having proceeded in much the
same manner at Euroa two months
before) had stuck up the police bar-
racks, imprisoned the upholders of
the law, and held possession of the
town for two days. Mr. Ennis and
his party pushed on from Jerilderie
to Albury, and at night, while
camped at the latter centre, were
surrounded by a number of police
and civilians fully armed with revol-
vers and rifles and bent upon the
capture of the outlaws, for whom a
large reward had been offered. He
soon convinced his would-be assail-
ants that he and his friends were
law-abiding citizens, and in due
course continued the journey only to
be overtaken by a severe snowstorm
that resulted in the loss of his horses.
By this time his small capital was
used up, so, not having the where-
withal to buy fresh horses, he sold
his dray and made back to the
Lachlan on foot, reaching the dis-
trict with no assets but the good
name and ability which had carried
him thus far in his career. His next
employment was on “Zara” Station
at 15s. per week. From here he
travelled to the Gulf of Carpentaria
with cattle, in due course completing
the long overland trip to the North-
west, and subsequently establishing
himself in the carrying business.
He was well known as a pioneer
carrier of the district for twenty
years, during which period he ex-
perienced the extreme hardships
involved in his calling in earlier
times, being once three months
without flour owing to the flood of
1886. Mr. Ennis still has the
Snider rifle which he carried during
that time when it provided the
means of securing many a meal that
otherwise could not have been en-
joyed. In the nineties he took up
and named “Poverty Point,” the
block of country near Richmond
which was amalgamated with the
adjoining area when he joined Mr.
Daley in partnership. The struggle
with droughts, poor markets, and
the various ups and downs which
accompanied his subsequent pastoral
ventures are dealt with in the fore-
going memoir of his partner’s career.
After taking up “Poverty Point” he
purchased “Elmore” and “Blan-
tyre,” and during his long career
as a pastoralist—a career in which

at "Moorna,” a pastoral property
situated near Wentworth, on the
Murray River, New South Wales,
MR. A. W. FORSTER.
on November 12, 1864, and is the
eldest son of the late Armourer
Winship Forster, a scion of an old
North of England family and a
direct descendant of the branch
whose ancestral seat was Banks
Castle. The Forsters have been
prominently represented in various
walks of life during different eras of
the family history, a cousin of the
late gentleman, the Right Hon. W.
E. Forster, having occupied the
portfolio of Chief Secretary for
Ireland during the Gladstone Ad-
ministration of 1880-82, while his
brother, Mr. M. Forster, is the
proprietor of the celebrated Forster’s
Brewery. Born at Whittongilbert,
Durham, England, on October 12,
1825, the late A. W. Forster arrived
in Australia in the year 1842, hav-
ing accompanied his brother and
that gentleman’s family from Glas-
gow, and, though trained as a
surveyor, immediately became en-
gaged in pastoral pursuits. In 1845,
when at the age of twenty, he set
out from Melbourne with his cousin,
the late John Hawdon, on an
exploring trip over the then little
known Lower Murray district, the
result of which was the acquirement
in that year of the "Kulnine”
country, which the cousins shortly
sold to Messrs. Crozier & Rutherford,
and of the historical "Mildura” run
on behalf of the Messrs. Jamieson
Bros., then lessees of "Murray
Downs” Station, and the late A. W.
Forster’s employers. On returning
from his journey down the Murray
he became the manager of "Moorna”
Station, continuing in that capacity
through changes in the proprietary
until 1878, when he relinquished the
position partly on account of the
death of his wife, which had occurred
during the previous year. For some
time previous to his demise he
resided in Mildura, passing away on
September 20, 1889, leaving a family
of three sons and five daughters.

daughters three are married —Annie
to Mr. Samuel Glanville, of Nowra;
Elizabeth, to Mr. Walter Boxsell, of
Dorrigoq and May, to Mr. Robert
Walter Linton, of Mildura. Mr.
Thomas Forster was educated at the
Glenelg Grammar School, South
Australia, and with a view of
acquiring a more intimate knowledge
of the industry with which he has
been familiar since childhood, con-
cluded his studies at that institution
when in his early teens and became
a jackaroo at "Moorna” Station,
the management of which his father
had a short time previously relin-
quished. He remained on "Moorna,”
at that time in the ownership of the
Crozier family, for six years, his
occupancy of the different posts con-
nected with the running of the
station during that period rendering
him fully conversant with the details
of stock work, the conditions of the
country, and the methods of coping
with the various adverse conditions
with which the man on the land had
then to contend. He was afforded
considerable experience in dealing
with the rabbit pest, the work of
eliminating these animals, which, on
a property of such large dimensions
was no sinecure, being under his
direction. In May, 1885, he severed
his connection with "Moorna” in
order to take over the duties of
overseer of "Gooyea,” a station near
Adavale, on behalf of the Milo and
Welford Downs Pastoral Co., con-
tinuing in the same capacity until
the early part of 1897. He was then
promoted as second in charge at
"Milo,” the company’s head station,
at that time under the manage-
ment of the late W. H. Calder, one
of the best-known Queensland pas-
toral managers at that period.
During the year of his transfer to
"Milo” he applied by ballot for a
grazing farm on "Cambridge
Downs” resumption, and having
been successful in securing this land
resigned from the service of the
company with which he had been so
long associated, entering into formal
possession of the area now known as
"Gracedale” on April 5, 1898. He

immediately became actively engaged
in its administration in partnership
with Mr. A. H. Pegler and Mr.
Mac Neill. Subsequently Mr. Forster
and Mr. Pegler purchased Mr.


Mac Neill’s interests and administered
the property conjointly for 21 years,
increasing the sphere of their activi-
ties during the early part of their
connection by the purchase of
“Trivalore” Station, also in the
vicinity of Richmond, the two runs
being separated by a distance of only
nine miles from boundary to bound-
ary, “Runnymede” Station occupy-
ing the intervening territory. In the
year 1919 Mr. Forster bought out
Mr. Pegler’s interests in “Gracedale”
and “Trivalore” and took his sons
into partnership. The two proper-
ties aggregate an acreage in the
vicinity of 75,000, which is devoted
chiefly to the wool-growing industry,
depasturing on an average a flock of
25,000 merinos. Well suited also to
horned stock, a herd of 1,000
shorthorns has been grazed on the
country. The flock originated with
“Wanganella” and South Australian
blood, and is remarkable for the
strength of frame and wool dis-
played, the latter combining good
strong combing qualities with good
length of staple, while it commands
prices equal to any secured in this
district, the wool sent from which in
competitive days frequently topped
the markets. Rams from “Denili-
quin” Stud Park, which is famous
all over Australia for the all round
excellence of its importations, and
which sent to Queensland the highest-
priced ram ever sold for Australian
use, keep the “Wanganella” strain
and a great stand-by in drought
seasons. “Trivalore,” which form-
erly was included in the resumption
of “Saxby Downs” Station, is com-
posed of mixed downs and forest
country, both the plains and the
timbered land being of a very heavy
carrying capacity, and, as in the case

with Mitchell and blue grasses. At
“Trivalore” additional fodder is pro-
vided for the stock by a prolific growth
of edible scrub. Both properties
stream of about 10 miles. Mr.
Forster administers both properties
from “Gracedale,” the two home-
steads being connected by telephone,
that on “Trivalore,” which is well
suited to the requirements of the
place, being occupied by his overseer
there. The “Gracedale” residence
is situated 43 miles from Richmond
and 22 miles from Maxwelton, the
nearest railway station. Nearly a
quarter of a century since its found-
ations were laid, the dwelling and its
environments have been rendered
quite up-to-date in every detail of
comfort and convenience, and are
replete with evidences of the artistic
taste which has succeeded in creating
an ideal home in a spot far removed
from the busy haunts of civilization.
The ventilation is all that could be
desired, and rooms and verandahs
have been rendered proof against
flies, mosquitoes, and similar pests
by a protection of wire gauze. With-
out pepperina, parkinsonia, acacia,
and other trees and shrubs, summer
houses, sheltered by foliage and con-
taining rare ferns and plants and a
well-kept tennis court, enter into the
general scheme of effectiveness. The
hospitality of the homestead is widely
known and is dispensed by the host

has also been to the fore, having
filled the office of chairman of the
Hospital committee, while at time
of writing he is a governor of
the Richmond Hospital. He is a
member of the Flinders Club,

sportsman and a prominent figure in
the racing world of the North-west he
supports generously the various

Many trophies at “Gracedale”
recall the numerous occasions on
which the colours of this most suc-
cessful owner have raced to victory
to the honour of amateur sport. In
the year 1900 Mr. Forster married
Grace Margaret, daughter of the
late Augustus Henry Pegler, one of
the group of pioneers which included
men of the type of C. B. Fisher, Sir
Thomas Elder, and R. Barr Smith.
after his arrival in the country while
working a threshing machine (it
being on record that the founder of
the Pegler family in the Island Con-
tinent introduced the first of these
machines to South Australia), it
behoved young Pegler to obtain work
ere reaching his teens. The well-
known Fisher family, of the his-
torical “Lockleys” Station, South
Australia, by whom he was thence-
forward employed in various capaci-
ties for twenty-three years, gave him
his first post. During his long con-
nection with the family he was for
some time the manager of Mr. C. B.
Fisher’s large racing stud. Be was
famed in the early days as an
amateur rider, and is recorded as a
winner of the Adelaide and Went-
wmrth Cuds and the Onkaparinga Cup
and other races. A great whip also,
he gained many laurels in four-in-
hand events. He was chiefly asso-
ciated with Mr. C. B. Fisher, and
under that gentleman took delivery
of “Bundaleer,” and for a period
managed the stock—comprising
31,000 sheep and 280 cattle—on
that property. Later, as the first
consignments of “Bundaleer” wool
were ready for market (the shearing
resulting in about 800 bales) he was
placed in charge of the carrying
teams, which comprised six bullock
and two horse teams, and conveyed
the wool to Port Wakefield for ship-
ment, concluding several of these
trips over roadless country before
the work was completed. One of the
posts which he held under Mr. C.
B. Fisher was the management of
“Buckland Park,” a station leased

national sport of horse racing in
this part of the State, and holds,
and has held for several past terms,
the presidentship of the Clutha

Born at Gloucester, England, in the
year 1837, the late gentleman was
brought in babyhood to the land of
the Southern Cross by his parents,
who settled in South Australia. His
father having lost his arm four years
by the latter from a Captain Allen,
On severing his connection with the
Fishers he became associated with a
member of another well-known Aus-
tralian family, Mr. E. M. Bagot,
from whom he accepted the


management of a boiling-down factory
at a place now known as New Thebar-
ton. In 1869 he undertook the man-
agement of an historical property—of
which he afterwards became part

owner—known as Ned’s Corner, for
the same employer. This station was
subsequently purchased by Mr. C. B.
Fisher, in whose behalf he continued
to manage until its sale gave him the
opportunity of joining Mr. Barr
Smith and Mr. Cudmore in its pur-
chase, the first-named advancing the
capital for Mr. Pegler’s share,
which, though small, yielded him a
dividend of from £BOO to £l,OOO per
year. Eventually Mr. Cudmore
dropped out of the partnership, and
Mr. Pegler, who resided on this
station for a period of seventeen
years, carried on as general manager
until Sir Thomas Elder and Mr.
Barr Smith requested him to take
over the management of “Milo.” This
he did, and most of the improve-
ments now standing on that station
were made under his supervision.
Previous to his advent to Queens-
land the firms with which he was
associated were known as Elder,
Pegler, & Co. and Cudmore, Swan,
and Co., their interests being
identical though on a varied scale,
but under a new arrangement these
companies were amalgamated.
Shortly after his advent to “Milo”
a rainfall of 10 inches in four hours
caused a serious flood and much dam-
age, necessitating his spending with
family and employes (48 all told)
forty-eight hours on a roofed-in hay-
stack. He had also bad droughts to
cope with on “Milo” and strike
problems, the affair of 1891 occurring
during his regime. Problems con-
nected with the strike in the nineties
concerned the carriage of wool, of
which, on the eve of a new shearing,
2,000 bales awaited transport from
“Milo,” the difficulty in the case of
this station being successfully sur-
mounted as a result of a verbal
agreement between Mr. Pegler and
the chairman of the Carriers’
Union at the former’s instigation,
the carriage of the wool being
arranged with the stipulation that
each party should lodge £lOO in the
] oca l bank, the side breaking the
agreement to forfeit the amount. In
1896, when in his fifty-ninth year,
Mr. Pegler relinquished his position
on “Milo” and purchased “Bun-
door” from Mr. B. H. Cudmore, but
shortly afterwards was overtaken by
a severe drought, and was con-
strained to part with the property.
He then removed to Charleville,
where he established himself as a
commission and forwarding agent,
the venture proving fairly successful.
Eventually he disposed of this and
other interests, and having cleared
his shares in “Milo” and settled all
liabilities, found himself in an inde-
pendent position and able to spend
the remaining years of his life in a
manner best suited to his active and
enterprising nature, touring hither
and thither in his own car,
covering many thousands of miles
in company with his second wife
on visits to his sons and daugh-
ters and the many old friends to
whose homes he was always welcome.
Eventually he bought a property
facing the sea at Lillipilli Bay, near
Maroubra, and, vigorous to the
last, finally passed away to the

unknown shores on August 13,
1918, in the eighty-second year
of his life. Many stories are
told of his readiness in emergen-
cies and his indefatigable energy


from his youth up. On one occa-
sion, when yet a lad, he was twenty-
three hours in the saddle in order to
convey the news to her sons of the
death of Mrs. Fisher, sen., and
riding day and night, and swimming
a river in flood, accomplished in that
time a distance of 206 miles. At
another time when a shortage of
bread occurred through floods pre-
venting the arrival of goods, the lad
volunteered to walk along a three-
rail fence to the nearest store, two
miles away, to procure this necessity
for the station people and his parents
who lived opposite the “Lockleys”
homestead. He accomplished the
task, being obliged to walk much of
the way along the top rail, an
element of excitement being added
to the journey by the necessity of
removing with a stick the numerous
snakes that had sought refuge on the
fences. During flood-time this means
of procuring necessities was often
repeated. As a lad Mr. Pegler made
two journeys to the Victorian gold
diggings, dropping across a good
claim which yielded him 7 lbs.
weight of gold just before abandon-
ing the industry to return to
“Lockleys,” the Fisher’s station.
During his career in the West he was
president of the Charleville Agricul-
tural Society. He was also one of
the group responsible for the organ-
ization of the United Pastoralists’
and Grazing Farmers’ Association in
that town. He was twice married,
on the first occasion to a daughter of
Mr. John Meritt, South Australia,
by whom he had a family of eight
sons and five daughters, all of whom
are married with the exception of
one son. Some time after the death
of his first wife he contracted a
union with a daughter of Mr. Met-
ford, of Warwick. Mr. and Mrs.
Forster have a family of five. The
eldest, Thomas Murray, assists his
father in the administration of the
properties. The other sons are named
Leslie Armourer, Neil Hurtle Win-
ship, and Harry Gordon. A daugh-
ter, Grace Hope, is the youngest
member of the family,
HENRY EUSTACE KING,
J.P., was born at Longford,
Tasmania, on November 15, 1860,
and is a son of the late Henry
William King, a native of Kent,
England, who voyaged to the
Southern Continent with the object
of engaging in landed pursuits in the
early forties, choosing Tasmania as
the scene of his activities. Here he
extended his interests and as a
shipowner, became well known
among his contemporaries both in
Tasmania and on the mainland. His
wife was Grace Ann Huey, sister of
Mrs. E. R. Edkins, sen., formerly of
“Mount Cornish” Station, and of
Captain Huey, who was killed by the
blacks when on a visit to Mrs.
Edkins at “Beanesbrook,” a property
situated in the Gulf country and
managed by the late E. R. Edkins
prior to his occupation of the
historical “Mount Cornish” Station,
Mr. Henry Eustace King was
educated at Launceston Grammar
School, Tasmania, and some time
after completing his studies at that
academy he set out for “Mount
Cornish” Station, Central-west
Queensland, where he arrived in
February, 1878. On this large
property he entered upon the duties
of jackaroo, his keen application to
work and natural ability gaining for
him a thorough knowledge of the
many-sided aspects of the industry
and shortly resulting in his
promotion to the position of overseer,
in which capacity he gained
considerable experience of droving
under the difficult conditions
prevailing in earlier days. His
duties on “Mount Cornish” occupied
his energies until the year 1892,
when, with the view of entering the
pastoral industry on his own account,
he selected a block of land previously
included in the area with which he
had been so long associated, portion
of which was at that time resumed by
the existing Government for the
purposes of closer settlement. The
development of this block, which he
named “Dahra,” occupied his
energies until its disposal in 1900,
when he purchased “Alma Downs,”
a property situated on the Flinders
River and now included within the
boundaries of the run known as
“Artesian Downs.” He developed
“Alma Downs” for the sheep
industry, which he carried on there
for the following eight years, selling
this station in 1908. Shortly
afterwards he took up “Walkoege,”

resides, having in the interim
acquired “Cunno,” a cattle

ownership. The combined acreage
of “Walkoege” and “Cunno”
aggregates a figure exceeding 60,000,
the home property being also devoted
to cattle, and the herds carried on
both properties composed of
shorthorns of good quality.
“Walkcege,” which derives its
appellation from the initial letters
of the names of Mr. King’s children,

lies in the Burke district north of
the Hughenden and Richmond
railway line, being 54 miles from the
former and 43 from the latter centre.
Considerable improvement has been
effected on the run, which is well
provided with water, and bears a
luxuriant growth of Mitchell and
Flinders grasses, its formation being
indicated by broken plains, timbered
country bearing a predominant
growth of boree and gidya, and
basalt tablelands. Mr. King was
created a Justice of the Peace by the
Nelson Liberal Administration
about thirty years ago. He has duly
participated in all important
movements inaugurated in the
district, whether in the direction of
communal progress or in the causes
of patriotism and charity. In the
year 1893 he married Margaret
Loretto, daughter of Mr. James B.
Gill, an old pioneer of Celtic birth
and descent, who, after half a
century of active association with
Queensland and New South Wales,
is spending the evening of his life in
quiet retirement at “Walkcege,”
Mr. Gill, who is nearly 80 years of
age, was well and favourably known
throughout both States during his
long and busy career in the land of
his adoption, and made a host of
friends. Nine children, of whom
two sons and four daughters survive,
were born to Mr. King, one of the
daughters having died in infancy,
while two sons gave their lives
during the Great World War of
1914-18. Of these the elder,
Sergeant Clarence Barry King,
joined the Australian Imperial
Forces in February, 1916, proceeding
with his battalion to France, where
he participated in several historic
engagements, making the great
sacrifice on June 10, 1917, in an
assault on a German strong point
east of Messines after having taken
part in a strenuous battle on the
previous day. His record among
those whose privilege it was to know
him well is cherished for the fine
courage and manly virture which
distinguished him. His brother,
Lieutenant William Keith King,
M.C., was at the scene of hostilities
a few months after the declaration of
war between Britain and Germany,
having enlisted as a private in
February, 1915. He was in the
thick of operations on Gallipoli, and
later in Palestine, and was on active
service for considerably over three
years ere his superb courage led to
his death, his gallantry having
previously been rewarded with the
Military Cross. His commission
was also gained on the field, and the
achievement which is described by
Colonel G. H. Bourne, his
commanding officer, in the following
letter to his father caused him
to be recommended for the high
military honour, and it instances the
magnificent courage which proved
the possession of some of our
Australian lads when tried in the
fiery ordeal of events connected with
the greatest military episode in the
history of the world. Extracts of
letter from Colonel G. H. Bourne,
his commanding officer, to Mr. H. E.
King:—“Dear Mr. King it is
with the deepest regret that 1
write to confirm the news of
the death in action of your gallant
son, Keith. During a very
strenuous action, when we were
attacked by a large force of Germans,
he was ordered to fall back to a ridge
in rear and hold it until the reserve
regiment reached it, as the enemy,
having forced through the front line,
there was danger of their reaching
the ridge (the key to the situation)
before the reserve regiment got
there. Your son most gallantly
carried out this duty, and though
overwhelmed by superior numbers he
delayed the enemy’s advance. He
was to a great extent instrumental
in saving the situation, gaining time
for the reserve regiment to 1 come up.
He gave his life in
performing his duty. . . . He
contributed considerably to ultimate
victory, though every man of his
command was either killed or
wounded. . . . He won his
M.C. in a plucky raid on the Turks.”
Another letter from the same officer
states“ His (Lieutenant Keith
King’s) behaviour throughout had
always been marked by fearlessness,
but his last performance was heroic,
and will be preserved as one of the
most cherished records of the
regiment.” The opinions just
quoted are borne out by officers and
men who, by their presence in the
locality at the time, became fully
cognizant of the details of the action,
and who unhesitatingly pronounced
it to have been one of the most
brilliant efforts of the campaign.
LIEUT. W. K. KING, M.C.
"He died as he had lived —a gallant
soldier,” is the tribute paid to his
memory by the chaplain of the
regiment, the Rev. H. J. Clarke;
and, we may add, as a true
Australian cherishing to the end
the finest instincts of his race, and
nobly upholding the honour of the
name handed down to him by his
British forbears.


GEORGE PEUT, “Leslew
Downs,” Richmond, was born at
Copperfield, Peak Downs district, on
November 4, 1872, and is the
youngest son of Mr. Hans Henry
MR. H. H. C. PETIT.
Christopher Peut, J.P., who, of
Danish birth and descent, arrived in
Queensland from the village of
Wesselburn, Holstein, when the
province now known as Schleswig-
Holstein formed two duchies of the
kingdom of Denmark. The story
of Mr. H. H. C. Peut’s career in his
adopted country is of more than
usual interest, and helps one to
realize with greater distinctness the
hardships and sacrifices through
which some of our finest pioneers
fought their way to success. Accom-
panied by his wife and four children
(three sons and a daughter) he
embarked from Hamburg in April,
1864, on the sailing ship “Taurus
Schelle,” which contained 364 souls
all told. Of these 87 died before
reaching Australia. The ship
experienced rough weather at the
outset, losing two anchors and a
number of sails when in the North
Sea. During the long voyage from
the English Channel to Africa,
dysentry broke out on board, and
Mr. Peut experienced the treble
grief of losing his father and two of
his children, the former and his
eldest son, Peter, being buried at
sea, and Otto, then his youngest son,
in an African cemetery at Simons
Bay, where the ship had called to
obtain fresh food, medicine, etc.
After five weeks’ delay in quarantine
at Simons Bay the journey was
continued to Moreton Bay, Queens-
land, where the vessel arrived on
Christmas Eve, 1864, after a voyage
of several months, with the majority
of her crew suffering from seasickness
but otherwise restored to health,
save in the case of one man who was
pronounced to be suffering from
typhus fever. This one exception,
however, was the cause of the whole
ship’s load being again placed in
quarantine, this time on Stradbroke
Island, where, on account of a
serious outbreak of fever, their
condition became unenviable indeed.
MR. G. PRUT.
They remained on Stradbroke until
February 7, 1865, Mr. Peut, his
family and shipmates being then
taken to Brisbane and admitted to
the depot there, where, owing to
extreme weakness, he was obliged to
remain a month. On regaining his
strength he was despatched with his
wife and two remaining children via
Ipswich to a place known as Biggs’
Camp, to make his first acquaintance
with the conditions under which,
lacking even a knowledge of the
language of his adopted country, he
was to face life in the future.
Leaving his family at the Camp he
proceeded on foot to a point between
Toowoomba and Dalby, where the
railway line was in course of
construction, and here started work
with a gang of navvies mostly
composed of Danes and Germans,
one of the latter, who had been two
years in the country, and whose
slight knowledge of English, gained
during that time, gave him an
advantage over the recent arrivals,
being chosen as their foreman. This
German was always sent to Too-
woomba for the men’s pay, but on
one occasion failed to return, with
the result that Mr. Peut was at the
loss of a hardly-earned £l4. The
disadvantages under which he labored
during the first months of his
residence in Queensland evoked the
compassion of two engineers employed
in the construction of the line, who
not only sent dray and horses to
Toowoomba for the conveyance of
his family to a spot where some work
yet remained to be finished, but
helped him to acquire a knowledge
of the English language. He was
still engaged in work connected with
the railroad when the Queensland
Bank suspended payment, all credit
being consequently refused, while
bank notes became almost valueless.
To provide food for his family at
this crisis Mr. Peut shot and salted
a number of wallabies, which, with
MR. P. BUNT.
the addition of rations received from
the Government, formed their chief
diet for three months, and vividly
recalls the motley crowd, represent-
ing English, Irish, Scotch, Danish,


and German nationalities who used
to assemble round the Court House
at Dalby to receive food. When
conditions were restored to a normal
state he was agreeably surprised to
receive the sum of £IOO due to him
in back pay. While the financial
debacle still lasted, the railway work
being completed, he became engaged
in putting up four miles of fencing
along the line opposite a place known
as “Long Water Hole,” and while
busily employed in getting timber
for this work his wife gave birth to
a son. Realizing the seriousness of
her condition owing to lack of proper
food —their larder containing only
salt wallaby and a little flour—he
faced all risks, and, despite loudly-
barking dogs, reduced the number of
sheep in a yard nearby by one,
feeling that the necessity of the
moment more than justified the
deed. When the fencing upon
which he was engaged was completed
he was presented with his wages, and
relates as an amusing incident
illustrative of his ignorance of
English, that after carefully count-
ing the money and finding £2O in
excess of the amount due, he seized
the first opportunity of explaining
the circumstance to his chief, who
exclaimed, “No, no! It’s a bonus,”
leaving him as much in the dark as
ever, his doubts being only dispelled
with the information that the
surplus was a present. With the
remark, “I see you are an honest
difficulties prevented him from
undertaking this work. Purchasing
horse, harness, and spring-cart,
therefore, he placed his wife and
family aboard and set out for
Hornet Bank Station on the Upper

Dawson, where he finally arrived
after experiencing many setbacks
en route, obtaining work on an out-
station in charge of a flock of sheep,
his wife undertaking cooking for the
head station. He remained at
“Hornet Bank” for three years, and
during that time, with the view of
words; “I made my own soap, I
made my own trousers from flour
bags, and made boots for myself
from greenhide.” The combined
wages of the pair while on this
station did not amount to more than
£l2O for the three years, yet at time
of leaving he was able to purchase
four horses, a new dray, and a
tarpaulin with which to cover it, and
had £BO in cash to the good.
From “Hornet Bank” he went to
Rockhampton, and from there to
the Peak Downs Copper Mine, in
the vicinity of which he became
engaged in cutting wood and carting
it to the field, his work resulting in
an increase of capital and the
purchase of additional horses. Hav-
ing thus got together quite a large
team he started in the carrying
trade, his original trips being made
with loads of wool to Rockhampton
from the backblock stations, to which
he always returned laden with food-
stuffs. On one of his later trips,
which lasted five months and was
undertaken in 1881, after complet-
ing his sixteenth year in the Colony,
he received over £35 per ton for
carrying, being on the roads with
three teams during the period of
severe drought. His earnings, as the
results of the inward and outward
trips during that five months,
amounted to £497. It was the
practice of Mr. Peut during this
period of his career to load up at
Emerald and proceed to Aramac via

man, Peut,” his chief, a Mr. Brady,
offered him the construction of all
the culverts and bridges on the
railway line between Dalby and
“Long Water Hole,” but linguistic
improving his own and his family’s
position, put by all his earnings and
augmented his savings by training
sheep dogs, for which he received £4
and £5 per head, and to use his own
Muttaburra and then on to Winton,
and a new team having been pur-
chased for each of his song, as in turn
they proved their capability, he had
four teams on the roads before the


railway to Barcaldine was opened.
He was the first carrier to arrive in
Barcaldine with a loading of wool
for railage. In the year 1887 he
made his last carrying trip, and
having handed over the management
of all the teams to his sons, three
years later, in conjunction with Mr.
Thomas Nolan, then manager for
Messrs. Cobb & Co., made his first
essay in the pastoral industry by
selecting a block of land situated
about four miles from Barcaldine.
Subsequently, having bought out
Mr. Nolan, he enlarged the area by
purchasing a neighbouring selection
comprising 4,400 acres, which was
separated by about a mile of road-
way from his original acquirement,
which he had named “Westbourne.”
waggons in favour of his sons, and
selected another property, at Loch-
nagar, on which he erected fences,
drafting yards, and a residence,
stocking the run with 2,000 sheep,
and disposing of the whole concern
twelve months later at a profit of
£SOO. He next acquired 1,280
acres within three and a half miles
of Barcaldine, which, after expend-
ing £SOO in sinking a bore to a depth
of 1,400 feet and otherwise improv-
ing he sold in 1909 for £1,200. He
had stocked this property in drought
time with “Elderslie” ewes, pur-
chased on the roads in an exhausted
condition at the rate of 6d. per head
for such as he could muster, securing
1,600 which eventually regained
their strength, and when mated with
in Oak Street, known as Peut
Avenue, was planted under his
direction. His services to the Hos-
pital, the Race and Rifle Clubs and
the Caledonian Society of Barcaldine
have been recognized by his appoint-
ment (to a life membership in all
those bodies. For twenty-five years
he has held a Commission of the
Peace, and since 1887 has been a
member of the Masonic Fraternity
(English Constitution). As instanc-
ing the esteem in which he was held
by his fellow-townsmen, we quote
the following address bearing the
signature of the Chairman of the
Council and Clerk of the Shire on
behalf of the people of Barcaldine,
accompanying which was presented
a purse of sovereigns, on the

He then took up 1,900 acres of
adjoining land, thus increasing the
area of “Westbourne” to 10,000
acres, which he stocked with 2,300
wethers for which he paid ss. 3d.
per head, selling them three months
later at a profit of £2OO. His next
purchase was a flock of 3,000 wethers
at 6s. per head from the Hon. John
Murray, which, having twice shorn
in nine ’months, he disposed of at a
satisfactory profit, buying in their
stead, 5,000 maiden ewes from
“Barcaldine Downs” Station at 2s.
per head. Subsequently he sold
“Westbourne” with its stock, com-
prising 5,000 sheep and 16 head of
cattle, to a Mr. Turnbull, having
cleared £4,640 on the property. At
this juncture he relinquished all
interest in his four teams and
rams from ‘‘Barcaldine Downs,”
purchased at 10s. per head, proved
a highly profitable investment. In
1893 Mr. Pent became a member of
the Barcaldine Shire Council, an
office which he retained for twenty
years, being chairman of that body
for many terms in succession, and
proving himself throughout his long
connection with local government one
of the most enterprising residents of
the district. He often journeyed
to Brisbane at his own expense when
it became necessary to obtain funds
to carry out his developmental
schemes which embodied the inaug-
uration and completion of the town
water system, the erection of public
buildings, and the introduction of
various innovations for the benefit
of the public. The avenue of trees

departure from Barcaldine it was
decided to publicly recognize the
valuable services you have rendered
to this town and district during the
twenty years you have been associ-
ated with the local governing bodies,
inaugurating many of the various
improvements to the town, and
invariably giving your time, presence
and advice for the advancement of
all matters pertaining to the pros-

August, 1898, Edith, daughter of
Mr. Philip Bunt, a native of New
South Wales, and a member of a
family who settled in the parent
State about a century ago. Mr.
Bunt, who in his younger days was
highly reputed in the carrying trade,
has for the past thirty years been a
well-known identity of Barcaldine,
where the last ten years of his life
have been spent in retirement. Of
the union of Mr. and Mrs. George
Peut there is a family of four sons
and five daughters. The eldest son,
George Leslie Peut, who is now in
his twenty-third year, and engaged
in assisting his father in the admin-
istration of his pastoral interests,
offered his services to the Empire
Longreach with outlying stations.
He continued carrying for the follow-
ing twenty years, at the termination
of which, having acquired the capital
essential for carrying on a grazing
venture, he balloted for, and was
successful in securing 24,000 acres
of country formerly included in
“Maxwelton” Station resumption.
He named the property "Leslew
Downs,” and later added to the
acreage under his control by the
purchase of "Glengariff,” and
"Oakley.” "Glengariff,” which was
formerly included in the area of a
station near Prairie known as
"Rockwood,” embraces 26,000 acres

appearance of an older pastoral home
of the type whose very exterior

within. The grounds have been
cultivated in the direction of both

garden being a notable feature of
“Leslew Downs.” A self-made man
of practical temperament, Mr. G.
Peut, though ever on the alert to
profitably handle every hour for the

large family, has not failed to
participate in those movements
instituted for the advancement of
the district, and has generously sup-
ported the causes of patriotism and

hostilities frustrated. None the less
it is our privilege to record that Mr.
George Leslie Peut, by his action in

CLIVE WILLIAM ECKFORD,
“Artesian Downs,” Richmond, was
born in Maitland, New Soiith Wales
on April 4, 1884, and is the third
son of the late Robert Francis
Maitland Eckford, who during his
lifetime was well known as the owner
of “Glenroy” Station, near Millie,
which he inherited from his father,
John Eckford, by whom it was taken
up about the middle of the last
century. “Glenroy” is now held by
a member of the third generation of
the family born under the Southern
Cross. Thirty-five years ago the
late R. F. M. Eckford, who was also
a native of Maitland, and John
Eckford’s youngest son laid the
foundations of the fine merino stud
which was a notable feature of
“Glenroy,” purchasing for the
purpose the best strains then avail-
able in Tasmania from prominent
breeders in that State. The Eckford
family is of Scottish descent and was
established in Australia by William
E. Eckford towards the end of the
eighteenth century, when, accom-
panied by two of his brothers (one
of whom settled in India and the
other in America), he left Ayrshire,
Scotland, to undertake in a military
capacity on one of the fleet vessels

settlement of New South Wales.

“Breeza,” John Eckford travelled
still further north until he arrived
at country beyond the Nandewar
Range, in the Namoi district, where
he settled, leasing from the Crown
a vast inland plain composed of rich
pastoral lands and highly adapted
to breeding. He named his property
“Malaraway,” and was the first
white man to settle there. After a
few years he acquired an adjoining
property, “Glenroy,” then known as
“Millie North,” and held both
estates during his life, finally
bequeathing them to his children,
from whom they descended to the
Eckfords now in possession. Towards
the end of a career in which was
experienced to the full the perilous
conditions involved in the visitations
of floods and droughts and in the
proximity of numerous and often
hostile natives whose depredations
necessitated the yarding and feeding
of working bullocks and all big
stock—which had to be watched by
night to guard them from treacher-
ous attacks —Mr. Eckford lived in
well-earned ease at his home

His death occurred in the year
1888. Robert F. M. Eckford died

experience in every department of

the management of the stock and
station business of the firm, from
which he resigned to take a similar
position with Messrs. Weaver &
Perry, Ltd., Sydney. After five
years of service with the last-men-
tioned firm he decided to enter the
pastoral industry in Queensland,
and with this objective joined
forces with Mr. T. W. Storey
in acquiring “Artesian Downs,” a
well-known property in the Flinders
district. He immediately entered
upon the management of the area and
continued to be associated with Mr.

GEORGE HERBERT STUART,
J.P., manager of “Dagworth” Sta-
tion, Winton, was born at “Boon-
dooma,” a station situated at the
head of the Burnett River, on
February 4, 1868. He is the second
son of the late James William
Stuart, who was one of the early
pioneers of Northern Queensland and
a prominent pastoralist of that and
the Central district of the State.
Born in Inverness in the year 1836,
the late gentleman was educated at
the University of Scotland. On
leaving school he entered a woollen
manufacturing business, in connec-
tion with which he originated a
texture afterwards known as camel
cloth, a rough-surfaced tweed which
was much in vogue for a number of
years. Being of a temperament to
which the possibilities of a new
country made a strong appeal, he set
out for Australia in the year 1853
with Brisbane as his destination.
Landing during the following year,
he shortly afterwards became asso-
ciated with William Landsborough,
the explorer, with whom he toured
the then unknown Peak Downs dis-
trict and the site and outlying
country of what is now the town of
Clermont. He discovered “Logan
Downs” and took up the areas which
he formed into the stations known
as “Oxford Downs’' and “Cam-
bridge Downs,” the latter having
been originally explored by him with
an aboriginal as sole companion.
“Oxford Downs,” which he took up
in the late fifties, he depastured with
sheep from the Darling Downs—a
venture which was not destined to
prove successful, however, owing to
the destructiveness of the grass seed
which prevails in the coastal dis-
tricts. In the sixties he joined Mr.
Alexander Lawson, his brother-in-
law, in partnership, thus adding
“Boondooma,” the Burnett pro-
perty, to his interests. At one time
Messrs. Stuart and Lawson were the
largest sheep-owners in Queensland,
but a succession of bad seasons
wrought havoc amongst their flocks
and brought financial ruin to the
pioneers. After his severe pastoral
reverses, Mr. Stuart resided in Too-
woomba for a few years, but
eventually made a fresh start on the
land in the Mackay district as a
sugar grower. However, the wider
scope for operation in the pastoral
industry was more suited to a man
of his temperament and ability, and
his extensive experience amongst
stock was ere long availed of by the
then owners of “Malvern Hills,”
from whom he accepted the manage-
ment of that station, which he con-
tinued to administer for many years,
becoming one of the best-known and
most popular citizens of the Barcoo
during his residence in that district.
“Malvern Hills” eventually chang-
ing hands, he took over the manage-
ment of “Gordon Downs,” on the
Peak Downs, on behalf of the South
Australian Land Co., who after-
wards appointed him their Queens-
land Pastoral Inspector. While yet
in harness, on a visit of inspection
to “Hamilton Downs,” he was over-
taken by the illness which, in a few
days, resulted in his death at that
station. A man in whom were com-
bined the charm of culture and per-
sonality with keen business ability
and integrity and a capacity for
hard work, the late gentleman was
universally loved and respected by a
wide circle of friends, and repre-
sentative of the finest conception of
a British colonist. He was married
in the year 1863 to Isabella, daugh-
ter of Captain Palmer Ball, of
Mountford, Tasmania, and had a
family of five sons and one daughter.
Three of his eons—Percy, Alick, and
Frank—have also crossed the Great
Divide, while Charles William, the
eldest, now retired from business
life, was formerly an officer of the
Union Bank of Australia, Ltd. His
daughter, Ada, became the wife of
Mr. T. H. Wells, late of “Farn-
bro,” Childers. George H. Stuart,
his second eon, was educated at the
Toowoomba and Brisbane Grammar
Schools, and concluded his scholastic
career at the latter institution. With
the object of gaining commercial
experience he then joined the staff
of Messrs. Parbury, Lamb, & Co.,
with whom he was engaged for the
following six years, when he severed
his connection with the firm to enter
the pastoral industry as book-keeper
and general station hand at “Gordon
Downs.” Here his ability and keen
interest in his work were soon recog-
nized, and within four years of his
first appointment he was given the
managership of the station, a posi-
tion which he occupied for sixteen
out of the twenty years of his asso-
ciation with “Gordon Downs.” In
the- year 1912 he was offered and
accepted the management of “Dag-
worth” and “Penola Downs,” two
highly-important properties in the
Winton district, which he has since
administered. During his long and
active career in the industry in
Western Queensland he has given
ample proof of his public spirited-
ness by supporting all movements
instituted pro hono publico, whether
for the advancement of the districts
in which he has resided or in the
causes of charity or patriotism. For
many years he was chairman of the
Peak Downs Shire Council. Mr.
Stuart received the Commission of
the Peace at the hands of the Philp
Ministry. He is a member of the
Winton Club. In the year 1898 he
married Lucy, daughter of Mr.
Robert Bell, a pioneer pastoralist of
the Central district of the State, and
of the union there is a family of
three sons and two daughters. His
eldest son, Gordon Haselwood, who
at time of writing is engaged in
commercial study, participated in
the Great War of 1914-18, having
volunteered for active service on his
eighteenth birthday. He took part
in the fighting on the Western Front
and became a casualty through gas.
He was invalided to England, where
he remained in convalescence for a
period, returning to Australia shortly
after the Armistice was signed.
The late ALEXANDER GEORGE
BLYTH, “Elmore,” Richmond,
was born on the Manning River, New
South Wales, on March 17, 1868,
and was the elder son of the late
Alexander Allen Blyth, who, hailing
from Scotland over sixty years ago,
made his advent to Victoria at a
period when the then Colony, yet in
its infancy, received its first impetus
in the direction of a vigorous future
from the realities born of the
wonderful gold discoveries of the
fifties. The late A. A. Blyth lived
for some time in Victoria,
where he was well known as a
mining speculator and investor.
Subsequently he made his home in
New South Wales, and from there
his activities extended as far afield
as Western Australia and embraced
interests in various mining
propositions throughout the
Continent, his enterprise rendering
his name prominent among those
responsible for the development and
expansion of this great industry.
He died during the first decade of
the present century and is survived
by one son and two daughters
and the wife who shared with him the
joys and griefs which chequered his
career, and who now, in the evening
of her existence, may look back over
nearly eighty years of time and


recall in the peaceful surroundings
of her daughter’s home many
eventful incidents, some tinged with
gladness and others sombre-hued
with less happy recollections, but
MR. A. G. BLYTH.
softened by the kindly touch of long-
passed years. The late A. G. Blyth
was educated at St. John’s School,
Glebe, Sydney, exchanging scholastic
studies for the attractive possibilities
of a career on the land when at an
early age, being established as a
jackaroo on a station situated at the
head of the Macleay River, near
Armidale, when in his fifteenth year.
He continued to equip himself with
further pastoral knowledge in the
same district until arriving at years
of manhood, when he proceeded
westwards, being for the following
two years engaged in the industry in
the vicinity of Bourke and on
different properties situated in the
level districts of the Mother State.
The knowledge of pastoral conditions
thus assimilated was followed by his
acquirement of landed interests in
the New England district, which,
however, proved of too limited a
nature to allow full scope for his
energies, and this fact, and the
obstacles which accumulated in his
path as the result of a financial crisis
which occurred some years earlier
and which proved a setback to so
many graziers of the period, were the
main factors in his final decision to
settle in Queensland, which, in 1898,
was thus fortunate in securing an
energetic and enterprising settler.
Three years after his advent to the
State he took up “Taree,” a pastoral
concern situated in the vicinity of
Aramac, and upon which he
inaugurated an energetic system of
development, successfully working
the property until 1914, when he
disposed of it and took up "Vellum
Downs,” Station near Whitewood.
He held "Vellum Downs” for four
years and with characteristic energy
established in that time many
valuable improvements, selling the
property to Mr. Horace Smith in
1919. Since entering the industry
in Queensland he has embarked on
several ventures of a similar nature
to those described above, chiefly from
a speculative motive, purchasing
both pastoral properties and stock
and selling when a favourable
opportunity offered, his investments
proving invariably successful. His

"Elmore” property was purchased in
the year 1917, and though carrying
several improvements at the time has
been greatly advanced in this respect
under his regime, and though
undergoing a further course of
development deserves to rank among
the up-to-date cattle propositions of
the district. Situated in the district
outlying Richmond, from which
centre its northern boundary is
distant some 70 miles, it originally
formed part of “Saxby Downs”
Station and embraces 100,000 acres
of mixed country characterized ly a
heavy growth of timber, the
predominating varieties of which are
gidya, boree, and whitewood, and
large tracts of open downs. The run
is subdivided into seven paddocks
which are well fenced and adequately
watered, the output of four
sub-artesian and two flowing bores
providing amply for the needs of the
stock, while additional supplies are
afforded in normal seasons by surface
and soakage water on different parts
of the property; 3,000 shorthorns of
an excellent type graze over the area,
the herd being yearly improved by
the "Mount Sturgeon” bulls fav-
oured by the owner. The late Mr.
Blyth was prominently identified
with various racing bodies since his
advent to Queensland and was a
member of most of the amateur and
other clubs representing the national
sport in the district. He owned
several good horses imported from
Sydney which have been highly
successful on the Queensland turf,
among these being "Cornsocks,” who
won for him the Central Queensland
Derby and many other important
events. He was a member of
the Brisbane Club, Brisbane,
and of the Civic Club, Charters
Towers. In the year 1899 he
married Isabella, daughter of the
late H. Costigan, a member of an old
Irish family which was established in
New South Wales at a period when
the then Colony made her first urgent
appeal for desirable settlers to
populate her vast tracts of virgin
country and to develop and
appropriate her splendid resources
and to lay the foundations of the

Mr. William Henry Carter, who,
having contributed by his life’s work
to the history-making of the North-

his birth, now lives in retirement at
Ascot, Brisbane. The station is
most desirably situated, its old-
fashioned homestead occupying a
site lying six miles from Richmond
and commanding a fine view of the
town, from which the property also
is plainly visible. Like most of the
older pastoral homes, the "Vernon

and reminiscent of early pioneering
days, possessing the peculiar charm
attaching to such dwellings which is
invariably accompanied by a home-

among the old pioneer group of
settlers and men of commerce on the
Darling Downs, the late Mr. Carter
was greatly respected both by his
compeers and by all those of a later
generation who had the privilege of
his acquaintance. His son, Mr.
William Henry Carter, was educated
at the State School, Warwick, where
he was a fellow pupil of the late Sir
Arthur Morgan, one time Premier
of Queensland and, at a later period,
President of the Legislative Council.
Concluding his studies at the age of
fifteen he entered the industry which
was destined to play so important a
part in his future life by accepting
a post as jackaroo on “Wambah”
Station, then the property of the
late D. F. Mackay. Here he was
initiated into the many-sided aspects
of station life, and at the end of

The wide interests owned by Mr. W.
H. Carter afford a striking example
of the achievement } ossible to
pioneering effort. Ranking with
those who have done so much
towards developing the wonderful
resources of this most prolific State,
his success is due in the first place,
as in the case of many of these, to
his own initiative, aided merely by
a capacity for hard work coupled
with natural ability and a deter-
mination to win through. As each
step of progress brought its cares and
responsibilities he shouldered them
with characteristic
grit and fought the
adverse conditions
of his calling with
courage well worthy
the respect of pos-
terity, and his
reward is perhaps
hardly commensur-
ate with his worth.
Throughout his
career, generosity
and uprightness
have been marked
traits of his char-
acter, and doubtless
the grateful
thoughts of many
who have been the
recipients of his
kindness speed to
the pretty Ascot
home where, in
the evening time
of life, he enjoys
retirement from
business cares and
is cheered by the
memories of a
life of work
well done. With his integrity and
large-heartedness are recalled his
qualities of sportsmanship. A fear-
less rider, he excelled as an amateur
in the various equine events of his
day, and in several districts was
accorded an enviable reputation—
backed by the encomiums of those
most competent to judge—as a
horseman. Mr. Carter married in
the year 1886 Julia Rose, daughter
of the late Cornelius Collins, a
descendant of a long line of farmers
who engaged in their calling in
County Cork, Ireland. Mrs. Carter
has nobly exemplified the ideals of
wifehood and motherhood, and with
the subject of our present notice
shares the love and respect of all
with whom she came in contact
during her life in North-west
Queensland, her helpfulness and
neighbourliness being reliable assets
at times when those two qualities
counted for more than gold. Words
fail to do justice to the value of her
sympathy and support to her
husband throughout the various
vicissitudes of his career, and to
these and other attributes of com-
radeship he ascribes much of the
success which attended his under-

the eldest son, was born in Richmond
on Christmas Day, 1890. He
received his primary education in
that town and completed his scholas-
tic course at Nudgee College,
Brisbane. On leaving that well-
known institution he returned to
Richmond, and under his father’s
tuition became of great assistance to
that latter in carrying on his
business there. On the retirement
of Mr. Carter, sen., from active
supervision of his north-western
properties, Mr. B. C. Carter took
control of the whole, which he has
since administered from “Vernon
Downs.” Though fully occupied
with his duties in this connection he
has not failed to play a citizen’s
part in regard to public life, and is
a councillor of the Wyangarie Shire.
He is a keen horseman and a lover
of clean sport, and wearing his
father’s colours has scored most
successfully as a rider, the ruby

at the present time,
as in the past when
under the personal
direction of Mr. W.
H. Carter—w h o
is a keen judge of horses—an
enviable reputation in regard to its
equine section, and “Yuma,” whose
picture is here reproduced, deserves
special mention as one of its
successful performers on the turf.
This horse won the Towers Jockey

the Milchester Handicap at the
same meeting, winning a double at
the Townsville annual meeting, for
all of which important events the
services of the famous Southern

procured. Mr. Bruce Carter has
ridden “Yuma” to victory at the

prominently in the early literature
of Scotland, pre-eminent among the
chieftains whose heroic achievements
and devoted patriotism are so \ ividly
depicted by their contemporaries and
later writers being Sir James, the
Black Douglas, a direct ancestor of
the late Richard Nugent Douglas,
the founder of this family in
Australia. The crest and coat of
arms which have been handed down
to the present generation were
assumed by the family in medieval
times when knights rode to battle or
tournament bearing upon their
shields device and motto expressive
of their individual prowess or
aspirations or some achievement of
their race. Numerous records show
that for centuries the line has been
chiefly identified with the Church
and the army, among those whom it
has more recently contributed to
these professions being the father of
the late R. N. Douglas, who was
chaplain to King William TV of
England and vicar of the famous
William Tell Chapel, and several of
his offspring. Of his sons, special
mention may be made here of
Captain A. E. Douglas, who fought
during the Indian Mutiny and
rendered gallant service, which was
recorded in despatches to England,
in the course of the Crimean War.
The late Richard Nugent Douglas
was twice married, on the first
occasion to a Miss Johnston, by
whom he had three sons, one,
Captain Bloomfield Douglas,
formerly an officer in the East Indian
service, having subsequently spent
some time in Australia as
Government Resident at Port
Darwin, and later in the Malay
States as Governor of Penang. His
second wife was Julia, daughter
of Dr. Robert Bree, and sister of the
Rev. Robert Bree, the latter, as a
minister of the Church of England,
having paved the way for future
members of that body in the
Dominion of New Zealand.
According to De Brett (who is our
authority also for the Douglas
descent) the family of which this
MR. E. A. DOUGLAS.
lady was a member is one of the
oldest in England, and connected by
marriage with the equally ancient
English line of Stapleton, both the
Bree and Stapleton families having
played an important part in
connection with the historical events
of the middle period of the last
century. Sir Martin Stapleton, of
Mighton Hall, and his brother, Sir
Stapleton Stapleton, bequeathed
property to Mrs. Douglas, which,
owing to some irregularity connected
with the will, was finally placed in
Chancery. The issue of the second
union was four sons and four
daughters, all of whom, with the
exception of two sons who remained
at home in the army, accompanied
the late R. N. Douglas and his wife
from their home in Dumfriesshire to
a continent then little known, even
by repute, to the majority of people
in the Old World, arriving in
Sydney in the year 1853. Possessed
of private means, the then head of
the family made a home in his new
surroundings, residing in Sydney for
about three years, occupying during
the latter part of that time an official
position in the Customs Department
of New South Wales. In 1858, the
year before the birth of Queensland
as an independent constitution, he
came with his family to Brisbane,
and after a brief period of residence
there joined the Queensland Civil
Service. He was appointed Clerk of
Petty Sessions at Taroom, where he
remained for some years, being
subsequently transferred, in the
same capacity, to Banana. His son,
Captain A. E. Douglas (already
mentioned as having served with
distinction in the army in India and
the Crimea), who joined his relatives
in Australia in 1867, was appointed
to the position he vacated in Tarcom.
At Banana in the late sixties this
fine old scion of a noble tree joined

of their race in the southern

Gilton, Kent, England, on October
5, 1844, and was in his sixth year
when the family arrived from Scot-
land. Educated at King’s School,


Parramatta, he studied at that
academy until reaching his middle
teens, when he entered as a cadet a
commercial house in Sydney.
Shortly afterwards he relinquished
this position and became articled to
the legal profession, in which
connection he continued to study for
three years. At the end of that
period he accompanied his family to
Queensland, and subsequently,
attracted by the great pastoral
possibilities of the then Colony,
decided to identify himself on the
land, securing work in the Dawson
Valley district. Later he engaged
in agricultural operations on his own
land in the vicinity of Toowoomba ;
his enterprise in this connection,
owing to a variety of causes, meeting
with failure. While still in his early
twenties he turned his attention to
horse-dealing, to which he devoted
some considerable time, becoming
well known in the various pastoral
districts which he visited in the
course of his work. In the year 1870
he was offered, and accepted, the
managership of “Trigimon” Station,
on the Maclntyre River, a property
belonging to the Simpson family,
well known as pastoral pioneers in
Queensland. Here he remained
until, attracted by the possibilities
barren of tangible results, he
abandoned these diggings, thereafter,
for some little time, being engaged in
sheep droving. Tempted again by
the prospects of speedy success in
mining pursuits, however, he
journeyed to the Stanthorpe district,

prospectors at the Quartpob Cheek

luck, he netted £9OO. Shortly
afterwards he was one of the early
arrivals at Charters Towers, where,
with unfortunate results, he again
essayed in mining affairs, losing the

pioneering efforts so materially aided

advanced stage of civilization. As
illustrative of the price of
commodities under the primitive
conditions attaching to the newly-
opened field and of the difficulties
which beset the path of the carrier
in the early days, it is of interest to
record that Mr. Morton Douglas sold
flour at the Broughton and on the
Burdekin at 6d. per lb. on one of his
trips, having previously experienced
the misfortune of a capsized team in
the bed of the Broughton River and
of finding the Burdekin uncrossable.
From Charters Towers he went to
the Mclvor River district, north of
Cooktown, where, like many of
the old hands of the period,
he attempted sugar-growing, his
initiative resulting in further
financial loss and his return to
droving as a means of livelihood, in
which capacity he overlanded sev-
eral mobs of cattle to New
South Wales for the Bank of Tambo,
where, in 1880, he purchased a
butchering business which he carried
on for some time, disposing of it to

0 NEILL & SON, “Tralee,”
Richmond. The O’Neill family,
which is represented in Australia by
its founder, Mr. Patrick Christopher
O’Neill and his only son, Mr. J. F.
MR. P. C. O’NEILL.
O’Neill, of “Tralee,” is a branch of a
line around which has clustered
traditions which have made it one of
the most illustrious in the Isle of
‘‘Saints and Scholars,” one of the
last surviving kingdoms of the Irish
nation having been under the
dominion of an O’Neill. Mr. P. C.
O’Neill hailed from Leinster, in
which part of Ireland his progenitors
established themselves centuries ago,
many changes having since occurred
in the fortunes of the family which
appears to have been chiefly
identified with agricultural pursuits.
Among its members who proved the
exception to the general rule was the
late John O’Neill, the father of the
senior member of the firm of O’Neill
& Son, who was in the building trade
and who is recorded as having
erected the first concrete bridge
across the Liffey in Dublin. Mr.
P. C. O’Neill was educated privately
at his birthplace in Ireland, and on
concluding his school course became
engaged in his father’s trade under
the supervision of the latter. fti
1890, while yet in his twenties, he
decided to carve *his fortunes further
afield, and being impressed by the
possibilities offered to men of
energetic temperament in Australia,
set sail in that year for the Island
Continent with his young wife and
the only child then born to him. On
arrival in the Mother State he
proceeded to Bombala, where he
became engaged in commercial
pursuits. Subsequently he
transferred his energies to Cathcart,
where he acquired interests in most
of the industries which flourished in
that centre and its outlying districts,
identifying himself also with all
movements instituted pro bono
publico and sparing no personal
effort that might assist the trend of
progression and development in the
town and district. After some years
spent in Cathcart he was faced with
the realization that his wife’s health
was in a precarious condition, and
therefore disposed of his interests
there and removed to a more
MR. J. E. O’NEILL.
congenial climate. His hopes as to
Mrs. O’Neill’s recovery were,
however, not realized and her
death occurred at Pambula, a
town on the coast of New South
Wales, in the year 1900, just ten
years after her arrival in the
country. The bereavement
accentuated the indifferent state of
health which he himself experienced
at this time, and therefore, with the
view of recuperating in the admit-
tedly fine climate of the north, and
attracted by the material advantages
offered by the youngest of the States,
he journeyed to Rockhampton, where
he was engaged in commercial
pursuits for over ten years, travelling
for a considerable time as a
representative of the firm of James
Stewart & Co., of that city, over the
whole of Western Queensland. In
the year 1912 he settled in
Hughenden, becoming the proprietor
of the Grand Hotel there, and in the
same year re-married. His second
wife, nee Miss O’Connor, is a mem-
ber of a family which was established
in Sydney at a period when free
settlement was first most strongly
encouraged by the metropolitan
authorities. Mr. O’Neill, though
retired from active business life since
1919, and now resident in Sydney,
holds pastoral interests in
conjunction with his son, with whom
he entered upon a business partner-
ship in the year 1920. During his
sojourn in Hughenden he played the
part of a progressive and public-
spirited citizen, being a councillor of
the town for some considerable time
and for a term tire occupant of the
mayoral chair. He represented
Hughenden as a delegate to the
Local Authorities’ Conferences in
Brisbane, and has been to the fore
in all movements tending to the
advancement of the town and
district. His faculty of keeping
abreast of the times is instanced by
the fact that he was one of the

EUGENE McCarthy, “Lily-
vale,” Richmond, North-western
Queensland, was born at Donough-
more, within six miles of the city of
Cork, on April 16, 1866. He is a
son of the late Owen McCarthy and
a descendant of a long line of
farming ancestors who, from an
early period of Irish history, have
jealously guarded the honour of
their name, and who in later times
fully participated, insofar as they
aimed at the realization of that
fusion of freedom and dependence
which has proved so successful a
policy of the Empire in her
dominions, in the many patriotic
movements which have emphasized
the sentiments of the nation. Mr.
McCarthy himself, though far from
being an extremist, is, as a student
of the political aspect of affairs in
his native land, a strong believer in
Dominion Home Rule. As a child
in Ireland he saw much of the
troubles which subsequently led to
the formation of the Land League
of 1879, and was only nine years old
when he accompanied two friends of
his family to Queensland, his
guardians settling in Rockhampton.
Shortly after completing his tenth
year he answered an advertisement
of the Balmore Wool Scour Co. of
that city, who immediately engaged
him as spare boy. For the following
two years he was occupied with the
general duties incidental to such a
post, and being endowed with keen
intelligence, acquired a thorough
knowledge of the different processes
connected with this branch of the
wool industry. Finally tiring of
the monotonous character of the
work, however, the lad left the wool-
scour company, and proceeding west
by rail to the then terminus of the
Central line, continued the journey
to Boguntungan, and then to “Green
Hills” Station, on foot. On arrival
at “Green Hills” he was given a post
as station help under Mr. Crombie,
one of the most prominent of our
pastoral pioneers, with whom he
continued for a number of years, his
work during that time covering the
whole gamut of duties usually
relegated to a general hand on a
large sheep property, including
shearing, fencing, dam-making, etc.
In the light of later events this
experience proved a valuable asset,
having been made the most of by
this lad in his teens who, even then,
had fully determined to make a
hard fight for success in the land of
his adoption. Long before he was
twenty he was regarded as a very
successful shearer, and when he was
between eighteen and nineteen years
of age his capability and industry
in other departments of station work
were recognized by Mr. George E.
Banning, who offered him a post as
contractor for fencing and dam-
making. He spent over eleven years
carrying out various contracts on
this station, and personally assisted
his men in the erection of over 300
miles of fencing on “Darr River
Downs,” as well as in the excavation
of five of the largest dams on that
well-known property. His indus-
trious traits of character being
combined with qualities of thrift, he
managed to put together, by dint of
saving, a small amount of capital,
and realizing that he was in a posi-
tion to make an independent start in
a modest way went to the Darling
Downs with the idea of taking up
farming. Materializing his inten-
tion, he devoted two years to the
agricultural industry, at the end of
which, realizing that his tempera-
ment was more suited to the wider
scope afforded by pastoral enterprise,
he returned to the North-west, and
in August, 1898, selected his present
homestead block under the tender
system. In the following year he
entered into residence there, arriving
with a pack-horse which, with its
burden, represented the whole of his
worldly possessions, and began the
strenuous work of development,
which necessarily, owing to his
limited means, devolved wholly and
entirely on his own shoulders. All
the subdivisional and such of the
boundary fences as were not pre-
viously erected, and other necessary
improvements then completed, stand
as the result of his personal labour,
carried on in the face of adverse
seasons and in the intervals of
contract work undertaken on sur-
rounding properties as the necessary
means of acquiring the capital essen-
tial for working his own venture.
During the first five years of his
residence on the property which he
named “Lilyvale,” he occupied a
one roomed tin hut, scarcely regard-
ing the hardships and total lack of
personal comfort, then his portion,
in the labour-crowded hours which
made the sum of days all too short
for the fulfilment of projects
destined to bring him nearer the
goal of his ambition. Keeping this
goal ever in sight, the time soon came
when his own interests demanded all
his attention. He had originally
stocked “Lilyvale” with a small
number of wethers, which he had
purchased from “Rainscourt” Sta-
tion. When his financial position
improved as the result of strenuous
and determined effort he purchased
a number of “Lerida” ewes and rams
from the Darling Downs as the
foundation of a “Lilyvale” flock,
feeling then that the worst struggle
was over, and that his start as
a pastoral landowner was on a
concrete basis. From then onward
he proceeded with unabated energy
to further improve his holding,
bringing it to a high stage of
development, experiencing mean-
while those reversals of fortune
consequent upon droughts, floods,
bush fires, etc., when the results of
a lifetime seemed threatened with
ruin, and his perilous position called
forth that spirit of determined
resistance to adversity against odds
which has resulted in the evolution
of a little penniless lad, far away
from his own land and his own
people, to a prosperous station
holder in his adopted country. The
block originally taken up by Mr.
McCarthy embraced only 10,000
acres. With a realization of the
needs of a growing family, and with
a keen remembrance of his own
strenuous childhood, came the desire
to guard his children against similar
experiences, and to better provide
for their future, he purchased, in
the year 1914, a pastoral proposition
of some 40,000 acres adjoining
“Lilyvale” and known as “Oxford
Downs.” Both properties were then
amalgamated and are still conducted
personally by Mr. McCarthy. Mit-
chell grass downs and mixed forest
country are the prevailing features
of the two areas, which depasture a
flock of about 14.000 liigh-class
merinos and, being adaptable also
for horned stock, an excellent herd
of shorthorn cattle comprising about
half a thousand. In the equine
section of the operations which he
controls, Mr. McCarthy devotes
most of his attention to the raising
of heavy stock, the properties
carrying, at time of writing, about
100 head of the favourite Suffolk
Punch breed. Such saddle horses as
are necessary for station purposes
are purchased as required. “Lilyvale”


and “Oxford Downs” embrace fif-
teen paddocks varying in dimensions
from 35 to 10,000 acres, and are
watered by the output of two
artesian bores which abundantly
supply with good water some 25
miles of drains traversing those
portions of the runs which permit
of the stock being most conveniently
served. The homestead, which was
erected in 1906 in place of the
primitive residence which served
him in the early years of his
enterprise, is a comfortable and
homely dwelling, and adequately
fulfils the present needs of the
family. Mr. McCarthy takes an
interest in the pressing questions of
the day, and in politics is a
supporter of the Liberal Party.
Such sporting propensities as a busy
life permits him to foster incline him
to horse racing, and are shown in his
membership of the Clutha Amateur
Jockey Club and the Richmond
Downs Jockey Club. He married
in the year 1906 Ruth, daughter of
the late William Coates, who, during
his lifetime, was well known to the
landowners along the routes extend-
ing from the Flinders to the Gulf
country as one of the pioneer carriers
of Western Queensland, his upright
character well meriting the regard
in which he was held by all those
who had dealings with him. The
late gentleman was of Yorkshire
descent, and a son of another
William Coates, who, a surveyor by
profession, followed his calling in
Victoria when that State had newly
received its independence as a
Colony by separation from New
South Wales. Of the union of Mr.
and Mrs. McCarthy there is a family
of three sons and a daughter.
EDWARD HUTCHINSON
DOUBLEDAY, “Consentes,” Julia
Creek, is a son of Mr. Edward
Doubleday, one of the pioneers of
New South Wales and a member of
the second generation of one of our
oldest Australian families, which,
founded in the Island Continent by
his father, also Edward Doubleday,
nearly a hundred years ago, has ever
since been associated with landed
pursuits. A descendant of many
generations of farming stock, the
first Australian progenitor of the
owner of “Consentes” hailed origin-
ally from England, and on his arrival
in New South Wales became the
owner of agricultural and grazing
interests on a holding in the Albury
district, where many of his descend-
ants still carry on the fine family,
social, and business traditions which
were solidly established as the basis

of settlement in the early part of
the last century by men of the same
calibre as their forbears. He had a
family of six children, of whom Mr.
Edward Doubleday, the father of the
owner of “Consentes,” was the
youngest. The pioneering enterprise
of the latter gentleman was also suc-
cessfully directed towards the pas-
toral and agricultural development
of the then sparsely-settled districts
of the parent State; and now, hav-
ing reached the ripe old age of three
score and ten years, he resides in
Penrith, being cheered in the autumn
of his days by many interesting
memories of earlier times that are
the survival of a career fraught with
incidents more or less interwoven
with the story of the peaceful build-
ing of a nation. It was left to a
member of the third generation of
the line in Australia to uphold the
family traditions in the firing line,
and this duty was nobly performed
during I*ll6 Great War of 1914-18
by his youngest son, Sydney Nor-
man, in many of the battles in
which the Australians covered their
country with so much honour. E.
H. Doubleday, of “Consentes,” was
born in Howlong, New South Wales,
on August 7, 1874, and educated at
the local school at that centre. A
knowledge of the industry which now
claims his chief energies was assimil-
ated with his growth in childhood,
which he had barely left behind
when his services were availed of in
the routine of work on the home pro-
perty. The sheep department of the
operations conducted by his father
was his chief care, and he con-
tinued to specialize in this phase of
pastoral work until he arrived at his
twenty-fifth year, when he became
interested in the industry on his own
account, following for a time both
grazing and farming pursuits in the
Forbes district of his native State.
The possibilities of landed invest-
ment in Queensland prompted him
to transfer his capital and energies
to the North, and he has since con-
tinued to be associated with pas-
toral affairs in this State. In the
year 1911 he purchased “Boggley-
wallah,” a property of 25,000 acres
situated in the vicinity of Hughen-
den, and after carrying on there for
a time sold out to purchase a more
impoitant property near Nonda,
known as “Gairloch,” which is now
in the ownership of Mr. Powne and
described in detail in another por-
tion of this work. Mr. Doubleday
held Gairloch” for a short time
only, as soon after taking possession
he received a satisfactory offer for
the pioperty, having accepted which,
and finding himself free for the time
being from pressing business ties, he
set out on a world tour, during which
lie visited many places of interest in
Europe, America, and the East, his
itinerary taking in various parts of
China and Japan. Soon after his
return to Australia he purchased his
present holding, which, originally
included in the area of the historic
Dalgonally” Station, embraces
40.000 acres of downs country
luxuriantly clothed with Mitchell
and Flinders grasses. To the fur-
ther development of this holding,
which already ranks as a highly-
improved proposition, he has since
devoted himself. “Consentes,” as
the property was named, has been
subdivided into six paddocks, the
largest of which has an area of
14.000 acres and the smallest of 640
acres, the others being of varying
dimensions. A bore, which has been
sunk close to the homestead and pro-
duces a flow of three-quarters of a
million gallons daily, waters the
stock through drains laid over a


distance of from 25 to 30 miles, and
keeps supplied with good water por-
tions of the creeks which intersect
the run. The homestead, a modern
structure, has been designed so as
to meet the exigencies of the climate,
and this aim has been completely
fulfilled. Built on 8-ft. piles and
comprised of large and well-ventil-
ated rooms, its french windows and
wide verandahs command a most
extensive and charming view, which
takes in various neighbouring home-
steads situated at distances of from
10 to 30 miles away. The grounds
in its near vicinity are sheltered by
large parkinsonia trees. In the year
1920 Mr. Doubleday was joined by a
younger brother, Henry Robert, in
the purchase of an adjoining pro-
perty of 20,000 acres, which, known
as “Waverley,” is run in conjunc-
tion with “Consentes.” “Waverley”
is also a well-developed run, and is
characterized by those features
which indicate the nature of the
larger holding, and it is watered by
the “Consentes” bore. A merino
flock of about 20,000, founded on
“Wanganella” blood and kept true
to type by the importation of rams
from the famous “Boonoke” stud,
is distributed over the two runs.
Horses in sufficient numbers for sta-
tion requirements are also bred by
the brothers. Henry Robert Double-
day was born in Howlong, in the
Mother State, and attended the local
school until arriving at years of use-
fulness, when he shouldered his
share in the duties on the home pro-
perty. Subsequently he was engaged
for some considerable time in agri-
cultural pursuits in the Forbes
district, New South Wales. He came
to Queensland in the year 1915 and
soon became familiar with the con-
ditions under which the grazing
industry was conducted in this
State, gaining further experience

while he was with his brother, though
he spent a considerable time as over-
seer of “Marchmont,” a station in
the district outlying Ilfracombe, and
owned by Mr. George Porter.
Actuated by that ambition which
spells success in whatsoever employ-
ment it is rightly directed, he worked
industriously at the calling which
occupied the energies of his pro-
genitors, and now, as already men-
tioned, is interested with his brother
in the ownership of “Waverley.”
Both Messrs. E. H. and H. R.
Doubleday are unmarried.
JOHN JAMES BEAZLEY, Rich-
mond, was born on July 27, 1886,
at “Clear Springs,” an early pastoral
holding situated on the Victorian
border of New South Wales, in the
Murray River district, its area,
under the ownership of his relatives,
having been considerably increased
by the addition of large tracts of
country formerly included in the
boundaries of “Jingellic,” “Mun-
deroo,” and “Copperbella” Sta-
tions. He is a son of Mr. Arthur
William Beazley and a grandson of
the late Thomas Beazley, the founder
of the family in Australia. The
last-named gentleman hailed from
Ireland, where, in many of the Coun-
ties, the name of Beazley is held in
esteem as that of one of the old
families which, at a comparatively
distant period, became identified
with the nation’s history. He
became one of the pioneer pastoral-
ists of New South Wales, settling in
the Grenfell district, where he is
best remembered as the owner of a
property known as “Pine Grove,”
which is still held by the family, and
where he met his death as the result
of an accident while riding. His
untimely end cut off one of the most
respected pastoralists of the Grenfell
district, a man whose memory is per-
petuated not only for the part he
played in the early development of
the country, but for the good works
which long outlived him and the
high sense of honour which

distinguished him. He was an expert
horseman a characteristic which
lives again in his son and grandson—
and gained fame in English sporting
annals as the winner of the Liverpool
Grand National, the world’s great
event over big sticks. His wife was
of English origin, and no doubt an
admixture of the finer attributes of
both races accounts for the indomit-
able energy and untiring industry so
noticeable in his descendants. Mr.
A. W. Beazley was, in his younger
days, most prominent in the horse-
dealing industry, of which he may
justly claim to be one of the
pioneers. At the time of the birth
of the subject of this notice he is
reputed to have been the controlling
power in practically the largest horse-
dealing operations conducted within
the Continent, being subsequently
largely interested in the Indian horse
trade. Up to the present day he
remains actively interested in the
development of horse breeding for
export. As the owner of many
notable racehorses he has scored
frequent successes in important
events in the South, one of
these being the Victorian Grand
National of 1898, when, in company
with eleven starters and carrying
12 st. 7 lb., his horse “Floater” bore
his colours triumphantly to victory.
Mr. A. W. Beazley, who now lives
in partial retirement in Victoria,
married Christina, daughter of the
late F. H. Holman, a pioneer grazier,
home at “Clear Springs” Station, a
quality in which they excelled even
in a country renowned for the
warmth of its welcome to the weary

fame for hospitality which this sta-
tion then acquired rightly clings
round it to the present day, when
members of their family fully live up
to the traditions of the past in this
respect. Here Mr. John James
Beazley received his early education,
subsequently attending a school at
various details connected with the
successful working of a sheep pro-
position. In 1901, however, he
joined his father, who at that time
was engaged in purchasing for
Africa, where Australian horses were
then in great demand, and in carry-
ing out his duties travelled as Mr.
A. W. Beazley’s representative all
over New South Wales and Victoria.
Subsequently he took charge of
“Orrong Vale,” one of his father’s
properties, which was devoted chiefly
to cattle and horses, and which en-
gaged his energies for four years. In
1910 he made his acquaintance with
the North, arriving in Rockhampton
on behalf of his brother and Mr.
Kidman, who were the principals of
the firm known as Kidman & Beazley,
and by whom he was commissioned to
travel a mob of nearly 700 horses
from that centre to Kapunda, South
Australia. Shortly after accomplish-
ing this trip he entered into part-
nership with Mr. Sidney Kidman,
who is widely known, and returning
to Queensland became actively
engaged in the trade between the
Northern State and South Australia.
Later, after some minor enterprise
of the same nature in conjunction
with others, he set out for India in
company with Mr. Hurtle Kidman,
a nephew of Mr. Sidney Kidman.
In the East he gained a thorough
insight into the necessities of the
Indian horse trade, acquiring as the
outcome of his experience knowledge
and one of the old identities
of the Upper Murray. Both Mr.
and Mrs. Holman will be well
remembered for the open-hearted
hospitality dispensed within their

concluded his scholastic career and
returned to “Clear Springs,” where
for the following four years his time
was fully taken up in mastering the

application to the horse-breeding
industry in Queensland. On his re-
turn from India he became actively

State, and was thus engaged until

ing the proposition presented to him
as a satisfactory one, he proceeded to
Norman ton, and from there travelled
over large tracts of country, inspect-
ing stock and effecting the desired
purchases, which in due course he
drove to the Richmond district.
From that time on he made Rich-
mond his headquarters, becoming
one of its representative citizens, and
remaining in partnership with Mr.
Kidman carried on with his usual
energy the business which has for so
long claimed the major share of his
attention. Apart from this he has
launched out on his own account
into pastoral pursuits, having leased
country adjacent to the town and
purchased a number of blocks in its
vicinity, becoming a shareholder in
a cattle proposition on “Saxby
Downs” resumption. In a somewhat
smaller way he has also become iden-
tified with the sheep industry, his
exceptional knowledge of all classes
of stock being successfully applied in
the conduct of these different enter-
prises. With Mr. F. Rogerson he

afield include shares in gold and tin

several important Western Queens-
land pastoral and agricultural exhi-
bitions he has fulfilled in all the
equine sections the functions of
honorary judge, his service being
requisitioned also in connection with
the sporting entries. He is keen and
true with the gun, and regarded as a
leading authority in the whole field
of sport. A bold purchaser of a good
horse, a number of promising per-
formers are always at his disposal,

race meetings being testified to by
many trophies, these including the

ROBERT PEUT, of “Eureka,”
Julia Creek, and “Ashley,” Rich-
mond, was born at “Barunda”
Station on March 24, 1870. He is
the third surviving son of Mr. Hans

time of writing is spending the
evening of his life at “Leslew
Downs,” the home of his youngest
son, where, rich in reminiscences of

a life brimful of incident, he lives
in quiet retirement after very many
years of useful association with the
progress and development of Queens-
land, more especially in the Western
districts of the State. That gentle-
man, whose career is described at
length in another portion of this
work, was a prominent citizen of
Barcaldine and a force in the public
life of that centre during his long
sojourn there. Mr. Robert Peut,
of “Eureka” and “Ashley,” received
a good educational grounding at the
State Schools of Clermont and
Emerald. Soon after entering his
teens, however, his books were
discarded and responsible duties
assumed as his father’s assistant in
the carrying trade, in which capac-
ity he spent several years on the
roads, being chiefly occupied on the
Central route before the railway was
opened to Barcaldine. He, like his
father and brothers, became well

known to the settlers of the West,
gaining, as the result of his honesty,
industry, and reliability, the respect
and goodwill of all with whom he
bad dealings. In 1892, when he
was in his twenty-third year, his
father gave him a team, and he
then began business on his own
account. Three years later he made
his first essay in the pastoral
industry in conjunction with the
founder and other members of the
family, their holding comprising
four blocks of grazing land, aggre-
gating 5,000 acres, in the vicinity
of Barcaldine, which they developed
and carried on until the year 1901,
when causes, involving a domestic
re-arrangement of ownership, com-
bined with the drought of that year
to break up the partnership.
However, Mr. Robert Pent and his
brother, John, retained about half

years was worked as an agricultural

the direction of the former gentle-
man, the latter continuing on the
roads. Finally the brothers sold out
to Mr. J. Arthur, and Mr. Robert
MR. H. H. C. PEUT.
Peut returned to his former occupa-
tion of carrying which engaged Iris
energies until the year 1912, when
he again entered the grazing indus-
try in conjunction with his former


partner, purchasing stock to depas-
ture some 22,000 acres formerly
included in the country comprising
“Dalgonally” Station, portion of
which was resumed at that time by
the Government of the day for the
purposes of closer settlement. He
continued on “Sunny Plains” for
three years, at the end of which
time he entered into possession of
the present “Eureka” homestead
block, and was soon deeply engaged
in the development of his new
venture in partnership with his sons.
“Eureka” consists of 22,000 acres
which have been considerably
improved under the energetic regime
of Mr. Peut, whose wide knowledge
of pastoral conditions—gained dar-
ing his frequent journeys as a
carrier and as the outcome of his
later trying experiences on the land
when droughts and other adversities
had to be coped with—proved
invaluable in the working of this
property. It is now quite up-to-
date in regard to fencing, water
conservation, etc., being subdivided
into twelve paddocks, the areas of
which vary from 8,000 to 200 acres,
according to a system by which opera-
tions in working the stock are greatly
facilitated. Abundant supplies of
water from the local trust bore are
conveyed to the stock per the
medium of drains which have been
laid down on the run. The flock
was built up from a nucleus
composed of sheep bred from
periodically renewed, the sires now
in use being “Bungaree” bred.

originally erected as two separate
homes in Charters Towers and put
up for the third time, with due
regard to Western climatic condi-
tions on “Eureka.” Its surroundings
contain all the concomitants of a
a charming effect of homeliness. In
the year 1920 Mr. Peut and his sons
purchased “Ashley,” a well-devel-
oped area occupying 20,000 acres of
good grazing country in the Rich-
mond district and carrying a merino
flock of the same quality as that
depastured on the home property.
Like other members of this family,
the former participates in public
life, supporting such movements
whose trend is for the welfare of the
district and community. Promin-
ent in Masonic circles, he has held
office as Master twice in the Comet
Lodge in Barcaldine, and is a Past
Grand of the Oddfellows (Loyal
Barcaldine Lodge). Mr. Peut
married in Barcaldine in the year
1896 Ellen, daughter of the late
Alexander Patterson, an old Scot-
tish pioneer settler of Queensland.
At a period dating nearly half
a century back, the late gentleman
was well known in the Central
district as a bush contractor, and it
was while engaged in this calling
that he lost his life as the result of
an accident. Of the union there is
a family of four sons and a daughter,
all of whom were born in Barcaldine.
The sons—Robert Christopher, Har-
old Roy, Claude Vivian, and
Howard Henry Courtenay—whose
photographs are reproduced herein,
were born on February 8, 1897;
March 24, 1898; May 18, 1900; and
February 2, 1904, respectively.
The three eldest were educated at
“Lilyvale” blood, which were trans-
ferred from the “Sunny Plains”
pastures to “Eureka” when the
latter property was first occupied.

MAJOR ERNEST BOSCAWEN
RANCLAUD, M.C., “Rodley,”
Nelia, North-western Queensland,
was born at Christchurch, New Zea-
land, on Nov. 2, 1874, and is the
eldest son of Mr. Chas. Edward
MR. C. E. RANCLAUD.
Ranclaud, who, a native of New-
castle, New South Wales, is des-
cended from a family of French ori-
refuge abroad. Dr. Ranclaud, who
was a member of the medical profes-
sion, subsequently married into the
family of Lord Boscawen, and the
line which he founded is still repre-
sented in Ireland by the head of the
Ranclaud family, the Australian
branch owing its origin to Mr. Chas.
Boscawen B,anclaud, one of his
younger sons and grandfather of the
gentleman under review, who arrived
in Australia at that period of our
history which witnessed an early
impetus towards national vigor in
the advent of several desirable settlers
from Great Britain. Mr. Charles
Boscawen Ranclaud resided chiefly
in Newcastle, and is recorded as one
of the most successful freeholders
of the early days of the Hunter
River district and also as a commer-
cial man of note. Numbers of his
descendants of the first and second
generations have their homes in
different parts of the Mother State,
though the son in whom we are more
directly interested as the father of
Major Ranclaud, sought other fields
for his energies. This gentleman,
Mr. Charles Edward Ranclaud, who
is an engineer by profession, in the
early seventies left New South Wales
for New Zealand and practised there
for some years, eventually returning
to the mainland and settling in
Victoria, where at time of writing
attaining to the age of eighteen years.
Subsequently, as a preliminary step
towards a medical course, he became
a pupil of the late Dr. Eames.

ment was more suited to a vigorous

he lives in retirement from
active pursuits. Major E. Boscawen
Ranclaud is a past student of the
Newcastle Grammar School, having
attended that academy until
and decided upon a pastoral career,
securing, with that objective, a
position as jackaroo on “Varrawa.”
He remained on “Yarrawa” for
about two years, relinquishing his


position on the outbreak of the Boer
War in 1899 in order to enlist for
service abroad, being among the first
to rally to the colours on the declara-
tion of hostilities. Volunteering as
a private he became a member of the

6th Imperial Bushmen’s Contingent,
and fought throughout the whole
course of this struggle, returning to
Australia with the rank of lieuten-
ant. Spending only a few weeks in
the Island Continent, he again set out
for South Africa, where he joined
the staff of the Bechuanaland Trad-
ing Co., with which he continued for
a considerable time, gaining a wide
knowledge of the country in the
course of the firm’s operation in Bula-
wayo and the surrounding districts.
During his connection with this
company he was afforded varied
experiences of life in Rhodesia, being
most successful throughout a consid-
erable period spent in big game
shooting in the Zambezi area. In
the year 1906 he returned to Aus-
tralia, and after a short stay in New
South Wales proceeded to Queens-
land, where, acquiring a property
known as “Wadleigh,” near Miriam
Vale, he became interested in
dairying on a large scale. The
direction of affairs on “Wadleigh”
occupied his chief energies until the
declaration of war between Britain
and Germany in 1914, the eventua-
tion of this crisis in our history
bringing strongly to the surface those
qualities of patriotic ardour which
prompted him to give of his best to
the Empire in the course of the
South African War, and resulting
in his enlistment with the Australian
Imperial Forces in 1915. He was
given a commission in recognition
of former services and participated
in the Egyptian campaign through-
out the course of the war, holding
a lieutenant’s rank for eighteen
months, a year’s captaincy, and
attained his majority in July, 1918, a
short time previous to the signing of
the Armistice. For general service
in the many battles on the Eastern
Front in which he personally took
part he was awarded the Military
Cross, while his conduct in the first
Gaza battle singled him out for
special mention in despatches.
Shortly after his return to Australia
he again identified himself with the
pastoral industry, purchasing in
conjunction with Mr. Gaden, of
“Molangool” Station, “Rodley” and
“Alick,” two runs amalgamated into
a single holding under the title of
“Rodley,” and consisting of about
40,000 acres of exceptionally fine
grazing country characterized by
well-shaded open downs luxuriantly
covered with Mitchell and Flinders
grasses. On this property Maior
Ranclaud is now engaged. The
partners devote “Rodlev” to the
sheep industry, for which it is
eminently suited, as apart from the
excellence of its pastures it is most
conveniently situated in regard to
transport facilities, embracing coun-
try lying less than ten miles from
Nonda and Nelia railway sidings.
The natural water supply, which is
afforded by permanent holes in
Alick’s Creek, which intersects the
southern portion of the run, is
magnificently supplemented by an
artesian bore which distributes an
output of a million and a quarter
gallons daily right through the area.
Set in a fragrant grove of mimosa in
the midst of far-reaching plains the
homestead creates in the mind of an
approaching traveller a delightful
impression of homeliness, the charm
of its design being accentuated by
the continual verdure of the shelter-
ing foliage. At “Wollun” Station,
Armidale, in the year 1906, Major
Ranclaud married Margaretta,
daughter of Mr. Charles R. Blax-
land, a grandson of the famous
Australian explorer, who, in 1813,
with W .C. Wentworth and Lieuten-
ant Lawson opened the first path
over the Blue Mountains. Of the
union there is a family of two sons
and three daughters.
THOMAS BALL, “Rockvale,”
Nelia, North-western Queensland,
was born at Mount Gambier, South
Australia, on November 15, 1867,
and is a son of the late Henry Ball,
a native of Staffordshire, England,
who brought his wife and the only
son then born to him to South
Australia in the year 1855, having
accomplished the voyage from the
Old World in the ship “Nabob.’'
Though descended from farming
stock, the late Henry Ball was by
trade a blacksmith, and pursued
that calling for the five years
following the date of his arrival in
Adelaide, being obliged to seek
other fields for his energies in 1860,
owing to ill-health caused by severe
labour at the forge. Proceeding,
therefore, with his family to the
Mount Gambier district he secured
work as a farm hand, and finding
the out-door life beneficial to his
constitution, continued in agricul-
tural pursuits for very many years,
eventually, in 1870, becoming the
owner of a mixed farming and
dairying concern near Mingbool.
He successfully worked this property
until 1884, when, disposing of it, he
retired to the home of his eldest son,
Mr. George Henry Ball, who lived
near Casterton, Victoria, and with
whom he resided, continuing to take
MR. H. BALL.
an active interest in landed pursuits
until the time of his death in the
year 1904. Both the late Henry
Ball and his wife were representative
types of the colonists to whom the
country owed so much while yet in


its infancy, the latter, whose death
occurred in 1913 at the ripe old age
of eighty-four, leaving a record of
loyal wifehood and splendid
motherhood that will, no doubt, be
cherished by their children’s child-
ren for generations yet to come.
Their family consisted of four sons
and three daughters, of whom three
sons and a daughter survive, Mr.
Thomas Ball, being the only member
residing in Queensland. While
benefiting by such educational
facilities as the times and surround-
ings of his childhood afforded, he
performed, from his ninth year
onwards, his full share of work in
the daily routine of farm life, and
continued to be employed in the
family interests, assisting his father
and eldest brother in their agrarian
and dairying operations until reach-
ing the age of twenty-five, the
knowledge acquired during these
years fitting him for the larger issues
of life, and being applicable in the
gradually widening sphere of influ-
ences which ended in the control of
the enterprises which engage his
energies to-day. In his twenty-sixth
year, deciding to strike out for
himself, he secured a post as general
hand on a farm which adjoined the
paternal acres, and being destitute
of financial assets, was glad to accept
a wage of £SO per year. Shortly
realizing, however, that the scope
strong enough to hold a sheep and
became proficient in this work at the
age of fourteen, when he could
account for 100 sheep a day.
Possessed of a temperament which

constantly sought broader experience
it was not long before the large
shearing sheds in Queensland saw
him employed as a worker, his
advent to “Goodberry Hills” Station
near Longreach, where he obtained
prompted him to put by a portion
of his earnings for possible invest-
ment in the future. His opportunity
occurred in the year 1897, when, hav-
ing acquired a little capita], he joined
forces with a friend of his boyhood,
Mr. Samuel Gilmore, taking up a
7,800-acre block of land on the
resumed portion of "Richmond
Downs,” which the partners appro-
priately named "Hopevale.” Devel-
oping to the utmost the resources of
this small area, Messrs. Ball &
Gilmore were subsequently enabled to
enlarge its boundaries by the acquire-
ment of the block of 18,800 acres
known as “Rockvale,” on which Mr.
Ball’s present homestead stands; a
year later, however, being overtaken
by a severe drought which devastated
both runs and necessitated the
acquirement of further country in
order to save their stock. Accord-
ingly, “Leilavale,” previously owned
by Messrs. Cobb & Co., was pur-
chased, the price paid for this area
being £1,500. They considerably
improved “Leilavale” by putting
down a bore, erecting sheep-proof
fences, etc., so that at a later date,
when the Cloncurry railway was
built through it, it became a very
valuable holding, and demonstrated
what be accomplished by
intelligent administration, com-
manding a sum of nearly £22,000

"Yamba,” a property of 32,000 acres
of beautiful Mitchell grass downs
adjoining "Rockvale,” was also
purchased by Messrs. Ball & Gilmore,
all the properties being jointly


conducted until the year 1910, when
a mutual dissolution of partnership
was agreed upon, “Leilavale” falling
to the share of Mr. Gilmore, while
“Hopevale” (which he disposed of a
few years later), “Rockvale,” and
“Yamba” were retained by Mr.
Ball. The latter immediately entered
upon a policy of closer development,
so that in the years 1913-14 he was

enabled to add to his holdings by
the separate purchase of “Walton’’
and “Beverley,” properties embrac-
ing areas between 30,000 and 40,000
and 16,000 acres respectively.
“Rockvale,” “Yamba,” “Walton,”
and “Beverley” comprise about
100,000 acres, which are administered
from the home property “Rockvale,”
the nature of which is indicated
chiefly by shaded downs. It is
watered by two artesian bores and
permanent holes in the Flinders
River, and subdivided into twelve
paddocks of sizes varying from 500
to 20,000 acres, which depasture on
an average a flock of about 20,000
pure merinos of South Australian
origin, which are kept true to type
by the importation of rams from
leading studs in that State. A herd
of 700 shorthorns and 100 horses are
also carried on “Rockvale,” the
horses being bred on the property.
The homestead, which is situated
about 14 miles from Nelia siding and
to the north of the Flinders River,
to which the run has a frontage of
25 miles, includes a d§ep-verandahed
dwelling, containing six well-ven-
tilated rooms and quarters and
offices. Replete with those details
suggested by the exigencies of the
climate or which are the outcome of
modern science, the home leaves
little to be desired in the way of
comfort or convenience, and is
surrounded by a luxuriance of
native shrubs and shade trees.
Within easy distance lies the
shearing shed, one of the best in
the district, containing ten stands
and with up-to-date Cooper
machines and a Cooper engine. The
shearers’ quarters and other out-
buildings are of an equally modern
description, the former being excep-
tionally well fitted up and comfort-
able. Mr, Ball married in 1911
Margaret, daughter of Mr. Frank
Quinn, a native of the Hawkesbury
River district, New South Wales,
who for nearly forty years has been
a well-known citizen of Charters
Towers, where, during the many
prosperous years of that centre, he
engaged in the, blacksmithing trade.
At time of writing he is in his
eighty-first year, and for long has
lived in well-earned retirement. His
wife was a Miss McGrane, a native
of Maitland, New South Wales.
Mr. and Mrs. Ball have a family of
two daughters, Mary Jean and Ivy
Margaret.

early age. Mr. H. C. Powne pur-

at various schools in the Motherland,
completing a secondary course at
Ardingley College, Sussex, which is
recognized as one of the leading
academies in England. Here he re-
mained until reaching his middle

years, when he resided in Sydney,
directed its operations, tiding over
various times of stress resulting from
drought and other adverse conditions
which the country has experienced
managerial ability. In the early
part of his career on the property
the nearest railway town was Hugh-
enden, from which it is separated
by a distance of nearly 200 miles,


it being then found as convenient
to bring much of the loading for the
station by teams from Normanton.
Mr. Powne became interested in the
industry on his own account over
fifteen years ago, and added to the
country then acquired by the purchase
in 1920 of “Gairloch.” This holding,

embracing an acreage of 33,000, situ-
ated in the district outlying Rich-
mond, is administered by Mr. Powne
from “Toorak” through the medium
of his eldest son. It originally formed
part of “Richmond Downs,” and
since its resumption from that well-
known station passed through many
hands ere finally being purchased by
the present owner, under whose
direction it is in course of develop-
ment for sheep. The flock is being
built up from “Eulolo” blood and
at present numbers 5,000 merinos.
Apart from his prominence as one
of the most able pastoral managers
of the district, Mr. Powne has an
enviable reputation for public spirit-
edness, having been actively identi-
fied with most of the forward
movements that have marked the
progression of this part of the State,
and a strong supporter of all those
of a charitable or patriotic nature.
For over twenty years he has been
a councillor of the McKinlay Shire
and for a term was chairman of that
body. He has been a member of
the Burke Rabbit Board for some
years past. As a Justice of the
Peace he has for long exercised
magisterial duties, having received
his commission at the hands of the
Philp Administration. In matters
of recreation he is a hearty advocate
of good clean sport and has lent the
weight of his support to amateur
racing for very many years, scoring
successes from time to time with his
own colours in various amateur
events, which have been tried in the
districts outlying the “Toorak”
property. Mr. Powne in included
in the members’ list of the North
Queensland Club, Townsville. In
passing we may mention the hospi-
tality which is the keynote of
“Toorak,” and which is so graciously
dispensed by its kindly hostess in
the home which holds for her
husband the associations of over
thirty years. Mr. Powne married
in the year 1898 Beryl Agnes,
daughter of Mr. George B. White-
law, who is a well-known figure in
commercial circles in New South
Wales, and is still actively engaged
in commerce in Sydney. Mr.
Whitelaw is a native of Melbourne
and a past student of the Scotch
College in the Victorian metropolis,
having entered that institution
shortly after its establishment and
represented it with much success in
rowing and other sports. His
family hailed originally from Scot-
land, and their name is to be found
among the earliest records in the
annals of the Lowlands. Of the
union there is a family of two sons
and a daughter, the sons being
George Cedric Tremayne Powne,
who is engaged in the conduct of
“Gairloch,” as already stated, and
Hubert Leslie Powne.
JAMES GOULBURN BROOKE,
“Glenbervie,” near Kynuna, North-
western Queensland, was born on
October 1, 1859, at “Worrough,” a
pastoral property near Seymour, Vic-
toria, which was at that time owned
by his father, the late Thomas Col-
lier Brooke. Hailing from Maccles-
field, England, the last-mentioned
gentleman arrived in Australia in
the early fifties, being at that time
about thirty years of age. He came
of a family various branches of
which have dwelt either in Cheshire
or Lancashire for generations, the
name being held in high esteem in
these Counties both for its associa-
tion with professional life and with
landed pursuits. For a brief period
following his advent to the country
commercial enterprise in Melbourne
occupied his energies, but he aban-
doned this phase of industry in
favour of pastoral pursuits, with
which he first became associatec
in the Goulburn district, pur-
chasing a property known as
“Worrough,” which he ran as
sheep station and held for nearly
twenty years. The scientific methods
which he brought to bear on the
operations conducted at “Wor-
rough” are evidenced in the facts
that the wool grown there, when
judged at the London Exhibition of
1861, gained for him one of the few
bronze medals awarded on the occa-
sion for this class of production, and
that he was the first grazier in Vic-
toria to secure 2s. per lb. for washed
wool—that is wool washed on the
sheep’s back previous to shearing.
On eventually disposing of “Wor-
rough” he migrated to New South
Wales and purchased “Tapio” Sta-
tion, near Wentworth, in the south-
western portion of the then Colony.
He continued to administer “Tapio”
for about ten years, selling out in
1881 to his sons and Mr. Jas.
Ormond (who formed the personnel
of the firm of Ormond & Brooke
Bros.), and retiring to Melbourne,
where he resided until his death in
the year 1888. The late T. C. Brooke
had seven children. James Goul-
burn, his fourth son and the subject
of this memoir, was educated at the
Scotch and Wesley Colleges and the
Hawthorn Grammar School, in Mel-
bourne, Victoria. On completing his
studies he entered upon the duties of
a jackaroo on “Tapio,” where, under
the late Mr. Brooke’s supervision, he
became proficient in the existing
methods of conducting a grazing area
to the best advantage. When his
father retired from the property he
became one of the purchasers as a
member of the firm already men-
tioned, and was engaged in jointly
administering the area with his part-
ners until at the end of about six
years it became so seriously affected
by the rabbit pest as to preclude all
possibility of running it with any
measure of success. This pest was
then practically in possession of the
district, and despite the fact that
some 100,000 rabbits per month
were destroyed and paid for, caused
tremendous havoc. Disheartened with
the result of their six years of effort
on “Tapio,” the Messrs. Brooke
Bros, disposed of their interest in
“Tapio” to Mr. Ormond and made
a fresh start on “Milkengowrie,” a
property in the Liverpool Plains
district, New South Wales, which
they purchased and for the following


twelve years ran as a cattle and
sheep proposition. In 1892, the
management of “Milkengowrie”
being continued by his elder brother,
the late Arthur Thomas Brooke, Mr.
J. G Brooke came to Queensland and
took over the management of
“Ambo,” a property on the Thom-
son River, which he administered for
three years. At the end of that
period he was offered and accepted
the management of “Duntroon”
Estate, which now embraces the site
of the Federal capital. He spent
three years at “Duntroon,” towards
the end of which he purchased
“Quambatook,” a Queensland pro-
perty, in conjunction with his
brother, who at that time made his
advent to the Northern State. Very
Northern State, was again placed
under his control, and still later his
activities were employed in the ser-
vice of the late James Rutherford,
by whom he was appointed inspector
of various pastoral properties—a
most responsible post, and ere the
advent of the motor oar a very
onerous one, involving continual
travelling over bush roads. In the
year 1913, when the estate of the
late James Rutherford was realized,
he went into partial retirement in
Melbourne, and from his head-
quarters there makes periodical visits
to “Glenbervie.” Mr. Brooke mar-
ried in the year 1899 Rachel,
daughter of the late Joseph Web-
ster, formerly a well-known tea
merchant of Melbourne. Of the
Station. It is devoted to the wool-
growing industry, and the flock,
which was founded from “Evesham”
ewes, is noted for the heaviness of
fleece produced, bearing an enviable
reputation also for the condition
maintained during long dry spells by
the 20,000 to 25,000 sheep of which
it is comprised. The high prices
commanded for the “Glenbervie”
wool speaks volumes for the standard
of the flock, which is maintained by
the annual importation of “Butta-
bone” rams. Composed of open
downs, which are varied with occa-
sional patches of timber, and well
clothed with Mitchell, Flinders, and
blue grasses, the country is amply
watered by two artesian flowing
bores, which form part of the
shortly after the transaction, how-
ever, the untimely death of the elder
brother occurred in Brisbane as the
result of an accident, and necessi-
tated the presence of Mr. J. G.
Brooke at “Quarabatook.” On the
sale of “Quambatook” in the year
1899 he purchased his present hold-
ing, “Glenbervie,” where he resided
for the following five years, during
which period he submitted the pro-
perty to an efficient course of devel-
opment. Towards the end of 1904
a larger scope for his energies was
offered him, with the result that he
placed a manager in charge of his
own holding and entered upon the
administration of “Tulcumbah,” an
important station situated near
Gunnedah, New South Wales. Sub-
sequently “Ambo” Station, in the
“GLENBERVIE" HOMESTEAD
union there is a son and a daughter.
The former, Arthur Webster Brooke,
was born in Melbourne on March 24,
1901, and educated at the Melbourne
Grammar School, Victoria. On con-
cluding his studies at that academy
he entered upon a course of training
in a wool store in his native city,
and subsequently proceeded to
“Glenbervie” to enter the pastoral
industry, and at time of writing
he is engaged in assisting in
the administration of the property.
The daughter, Dorothy Rachel Goul-
burn Brooke, is at present residing
with her parents in Melbourne.
“Glenbervie,” which is situated
about 25 miles from Kynuna, on the
northern watershed, embraces some
75,000 acres which were formerly
included in the area of “Toorak”
improvements existing on this up-to-
date property, the water from these
bores being conveyed to the stock
through forty miles of drains. Tire
run is subdivided into eighteen pad-
docks of varied area, which are con-
veniently arranged to facilitate the
expeditious handling of the stock.
Since coming into the possession of
Mr. Brooke the homestead has been
enlarged and otherwise improved,
with the result that it is now one of
the most comfortable residences in
the North-west. It occupies a pic-
turesque site on the bank of Glen-
bervie Creek, and the natural beauty
of its surroundings is enhanced by
well-grown shade trees and orna-
mental shrubs, which were planted
by the owner on his acquirement of
the property in the late nineties.


LEONARD LANDSBOROUGH
BODE, “Bodell,” Julia Creek,
North-western Queensland, was born
in Ayr, Northern Queensland, on
MR. H. M. BODE.
November 14, 1882, and is a son of
the late Henry Morell Bode and a
grandson of George de Bode, the
Ireland after the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes. In France the de
Bodes bore also the name of Mont-
morency. George de Bode came to
Australia in the forties and settled
in Newcastle, where he occupied him-
self as a schoolmaster. During his
lifetime, and according to his deci-
sion, the prefix that is part of their
name was discarded, the family
being thenceforth known by the
designation of “Bode” merely.
George de Bode had four sons,
George, Frederick, Francis, and
Henry Morell. Born in Kingston,
Ireland, on June 13, 1837, and
claiming also English descent—his
mother having been the daughter of
a captain of the Horse Guards and
a member of a family which peopled
Dashwood and Buxton—the late
Henry M. Bode, his youngest son,
arrived in Australia with his father
in the year 1840, in after life
becoming interested in pastoral pur-
suits in Northern Queensland. He
married Margaret, daughter of
James Landsborough, who was one
of the original pioneers of Queens-
land and a brother of William
Landsborough, the famous trans-
continental explorer, and of John

of changes from McClameroch —
which in time became successively

The last-mentioned gentleman was a
member of a French Huguenot
family, a branch of which fled to

Landsborough, one-time owner of
“Kroombit” Station, on the Daw-
son. The Landsborough family is
of old Scottish descent and their
McLandsborough, having dropped
the “Me” it is stated “because he
found the name quite long enough
without it.” David Landsborough,


the maternal great-grandfather of
Mr. Bode, of “Bodell,” was a man
of many parts—an able writer,
musician, poet, and naturalist. In
Ins calling as a divine of the Presby-
terian Free Church he was beloved
for the righteousness of his life and
the charity of his nature. His son,
James, Mr. L. L. Bode’s grand-
father, formed “Monduran” Sta-
tion on the Burnett, “Raglan” near
Rockhampton, and “Sonoma” Sta-
tion in the Bowen district. Both he
and his wife died at “Sonoma.” The
late Henry M. Bode had a family
of eleven children, and is survived
by his widow, four sons, and five
daughters. The gentleman under
review is the third son. Primarily
educated at the Ayr State School,
Mr. L. L. Bode subsequently
entered the Gatton Agricultural
College, at which he gained a prac-
tical and theoretical knowledge of
stock and kindred subjects. On con-
cluding his course at Gatton he pro-
ceeded to “Bauhinia Downs,” a
large cattle station in the Leich-
hardt district and then owned by
Mr. A. J. Cotton, one of the most
prominent of Queensland pastoral-
ists. Here, under his brother, Mr.
Harry Bode, the then manager of
the property, he was initiated into
the duties of a jackaroo. Subse-
quently he was occupied in various
capacities on “Bauhinia Downs,”
“Hidden Yale,” and “Tent Hill,”
spending on these three stations in
the employ of Mr. Cotton about
eight years, during which he was for
a considerable period engaged as
overseer on the first-named estate.
In the year 1907, with the intention
of acquainting himself with the con-
ditions pertaining to the industry
further north, and of launching out
Oil his own account when such oppor-
tunity offered, he left Mr. Cotton’s
service and for a year or so after-
wards was engaged in other employ,
eventually taking up a block of
country on a resumption of “Fort
Constantine” Station. He carried
on cattle operations there on a com-
paratively small scale for a couple
of years, disposing of the holding in
1912 and drawing the area now
known as “Bodell” by ballot when
several blocks on “Eddington” Sta-
tion were made available for closer
settlement. Having stocked his
newly-acquired country with “Nelia
Ponds” ewes, he built up the present
flock from this foundation, with
rams from leading South Australian
studs, the blood being periodically
renewed. “Bodell” embraces some
20,000 acres which have been sub-
divided into four paddocks. It is a
safe property as regards water
supply, being abundantly provided
for in this respect by an artesian
bore which produces a flow of about
a quarter of a million gallons daily
that is distributed to the stock at
convenient points on the run through
a system of drains. This bore was
personally put down by Mr. Bode,
who owns a good plant and was a
proficient operator in this phase of
pastoral development ere devoting
himself exclusively to his landed
interests, having carried on artesian
boring on his own account in
Western Queensland. Other im-
provements completed under his
regime include the fencing, which
has been rendered thoroughly effi-
cient and up-to-date. The home-
stead, which occupies a site in the
centre of the property, is a modern
two-storied building containing six
rooms, including a very large, airy
living room, that has been most suc-
cessfully adapted to western climatic
conditions. The whole interior
arrangements of this home are
delightful and the grounds testify
to careful tendance, both fruit and
shade trees being well on the way to
maturity, and a, vegetable garden
well filled with those products that
on other holdings are often lament-
ably lacking. In its course through
the run Julia Creek passes the home-
stead, its bed there containing a
chain of lagoons, which for a dis-
tance of about a mile are kept full
of water from the “Bodell” bore,
this feature adding a most pic-
turesque touch to the landscape.
Keenly alive to all matters tending
to the progress and development of
the district, Mr. Bode has heartily
supported the movements instituted
to this end. He patronises all forms
of clean sport, more particularly
amateur racing, and is a member of
the Kynuna, Clutha, Julia Creek,
and Cloncurry Amateur and Picnic
Race Clubs. In 1912 Mr. Bode
married Annie Ethel Cole, a daughter
of one of the oldest settlers of the
Springsure district, Mr. Cole having
migrated with his wife and two
children from England to Central
Queensland in the early eighties.
Of the union there is a family of
two sons and one daughter.

JOHN PEUT, “Sunny Plains,”
Julia Creek, was born in Toowoomba
on August 13, 1867, and is the
second son of Mr. H. H. C. Peut,
who, a well-known pioneer of West-
ern Queensland, and for long one of
the most respected, influential and
public-spirited citizens of Barcaldine,
made his advent to Australia in
1864, the year in which Holstein,
his birthplace, was wrested by the
Prussians from the Kingdom of
Denmark. The last-mentioned gen-
tleman landed at Brisbane and
started upon an eventful career in
Queensland, the incidents of which,
spread over more than half a
century, are detailed in another
portion of this work, notably instanc-
ing the results which may be
achieved despite apparently insur-
mountable obstacles by the exercise
of those qualities of indomitable
pluck, endurance and perseverance
with which Mr. H. H. C. Peut was
so remarkably endowed. He began
life in his adopted country, under
absolutely unfamiliar conditions and
lacking even a knowledge of the
language, as a navvy, and subse-
quently worked for a few years on
a large sheep station, whence,
with dray and horses, he made a

works in the town yet testify to his
progressive spirit and capacity for
books, being only nine years of age
when his efforts were requisitioned
in the routine of carrying operations
conducted by his father, for whom
at that age he fulfilled the duties of
horse boy on the roads. Subse-
quently he took charge of one of the
teams owned by the latter gentle-
man, whom he continued to assist
until arriving at years of manhood,
when he himself became the owner
of a team by purchase from the
founder of the family, completing
this transaction by dint of that
industry and thrift of which he had
had such a notable example in his
parent. From the date of his
acquirement of this team he was
actively engaged in the carrying
business until the year 1912, when
he entered into possession of “Sunny
Plains,” his present holding, which
he had drawn in the ballot of 1911,
having previously owned in conjunc-
tion with his brother, Robert, who
administered the area, a pastoral
property in the vicinity of Barcal-
dine. This property originally
formed half of a run composed of
four blocks aggregating over 5,000
acres, which were taken up in the
year 1895, and jointly owned and
developed by Mr. Peut, sen., and his

eventually rewarded with exoep-
tional success as a carrier and finally
as a pastoral landowner whose rapid
deals in grazing properties soon
keeping abreast of the times. Mr.
John Peut attended both the West-
wood and Clermont State Schools
during the short period of his
childhood which was devoted to
sons, who, after a few years, owing
to the drought of 1901 and other
circumstances, finally dissolved their
partnership, the brothers John and
Robert then becoming sole owners


of a portion of it as described.
These gentlemen were also part
owners in the stock which originally
depastured “Sunny Plains” under
the proprietorship of Mr. John
Peut, who inaugurated and carried
out those developmental operations,
which, now completed, mark this
run as one of the most up-to-date
of its size in the West. The
improvements include an artesian
bore which produces a flow of three-
quarters of a million gallons daily,

through twenty miles of bore drains

which was formerly included within
the boundaries of the original
“Dalgonally” Station, is devoted to
the sheep industry. In the first
instance the run was stocked with a
flock procured from “Clutha,” a
large sheep property situated in the
same district, but these were later
replaced with “Oxon Downs” ewes,
from which, with rams from the
“Burrawang” Stud, New South
Wales, the present flock was built
up. Erected under the supervision
of the owner and designed in
accordance with the means at his
disposal, the “Sunny Plains” home-
stead is a small, but eminently
or in the sacred causes of charity
and i^atriotism. Being intensely fond
of a good horse and a lover of clean
sport, his predilection for horse-
racing is shown by his membership
of the committee of the local racing
body wherein lie fulfils the functions
of honorary judge. Mr. John Peut
is a member of the Oddfellows
fraternity and also of the
Masonic craft, having held office
in the latter in the Barcaldine
Lodge. He married in the year
1908 Emma Elizabeth Willet, who,
previous to her marriage, resided in
Springsure, and of the union there
is a family of three sons and a
daughter.

22,000 acres of downs country
luxuriantly clothed with Mitchell
and Flinders grasses and lightly
timbered, are embraced in the area,
which in the last-mentioned respect
is more favourably endowed by
nature than most of the neighbour-
ing properties. Its subdivision has
been carried out with due regard to
the expeditious handling of the
stock, the paddocks varying in size
from an acreage of 8,000 to that of
less than 100. The boundary and
subdivisional fencing has been com-
pleted on the most up-to-date lines,

Cross. On his advent to the Garden
State he immediately directed his
attention to landed pursuits, and is
recorded as being subsequently the
owner of agricultural interests, and
other difficult conditions with which
the man on the land was faced at
the period, so, on the advice of Mr.
J. B. Nutting, a well-known pastoral
pioneer and an old friend of the
late Mr. Quarrell, he decided toi try
his fortune in Queensland, and with
that objective set out for the Charle-
ville district in the early nineties.
Here he selected a block of country
from the “Oakwood’’ resumption,
and naming his acquirement “Oak
Park," devoted the area to the sheep
industry, which, in the face of many
adversities, he carried on there for
five years, having struggled with the
effects of two severe droughts, bad
seasons, unprofitable markets, and
marsupial ravages during that time.
He finally disposed of “Oak Park,’’
and foreseeing a greater return for
his energies in North-western Queens-
land, accordingly set out from
Charleville to that portion of the
State, the long journey being accom-
plished in the saddle and the luggage
carried by packhorses. This mode of
travel gave him numberless oppor-
tunities of gaining valuable inform-
ation relative to the pastoral features
of the country through which he
passed and afforded him a knowledge
which proved useful to him in the
development of his subsequently
acquired holdings. He arrived in
the Burke district at a time when
homestead area and the adjoining
blocks were named “Oxton Downs,"
after his birthplace in England, the
remainder being subsequently sold
and other blocks purchased whose

the late Mr. Quarrell devoted himself

enterprise appears to have been
hampered by climatic adversities and

against militant conditions which
would have completely disheartened
a man of weaker calibre. During
his long ownership of this property
success and adversity were met with
that fine equanimity of spirit which

always distinguished him, and ultim-
ately his years of unremitting effort
yielded the prosperous fortune
which was so justly his due. In his
labour-filled life he found leisure for
the more prominent duties of
citizenship, his earliest manifesta-
tions of public-spiritedness dating
back to the days of his Victorian
enterprise. In later years he was
well known as a councillor of the
Cloncurry Shire. The late Mr.
Quarrell received his Commission of
the Peace at the hands of the Liberal
Administration of 1903. At Sydney,
in the year 1917, at the age of
seventy-two, the fine old pioneer
crossed the Great Divide, his last
resting-place in his adopted country
being in the South Head Cemetery,
Sydney. His wife, a member of the
Dalton family, whose name is hon-
ourably associated with some of the
finest traditions of the Irish race,
predeceased him in January, 1914,
leaving a record of loyal comradeship
and devoted motherhood as an
example for posterity. Seven chil-
dren, of whom two sons and three
daughters survive, were born to Mr.
and Mrs. Quarrell. Both sons, Her-
bert Ernest and Francis Victor, who
are jointly engaged in the adminis-
tration of their interests on “Oxton
Downs/’ were born and primarily
educated in Victoria, completing a
secondary course at St. Joseph’s Col-
lege, Nudgee. “Oxton Downs”
embraces 120,000 acres of luxuriantly
covered undulating Mitchell and
Flinders grass downs, which include
a small proportion of lightly-
timbered country carrying bauhinia,
apple and whitewood trees, these
affording a desirable shade. It is a
highly-developed and up-to-date pro-
perty, and provides a striking in-
stance of what may be accomplished
by capable administration. Among
the existing improvements are five
artesian bores, the water from which
is conveyed to each of the thirty
paddocks into which the run is
divided, these enclosures varying in
dimensions from 3,000 to 10,000
acres, and being formed with five-
and six-wire sheep-proof fences. In
keeping with a comfortable and
spacious homestead are well-built
outbuildings of a most up-to-date
description, which include a shearing
shed fitted with fifteen stands, and
fine shearers’ quarters designed and
erected for the accommodation of
forty men.
EDWARD TURCHILL ARDEN,
“Bauhinia Downs,” Julia Creek,
was born in the State of Minnesota,
in the United States of America,
and is the second son of Edward
Cooper Arden, a member of the well-
known English family known as the
Ardens of Longcrofts, which is one
of the oldest and most historically
famed in the Motherland. The
earliest records that throw light
upon the origin of the Arden family
of Longcrofts relate to the time of
Alfred the Great when it was
written of their ancestor, Guy, son
of Siward, Lord of Wallingford, that
he married Felicia, daughter and
heir of Rohand, the first of the
Saxon Earls of Warwick, thereby ob-
taining the Earldom. Their Coat of
Arms is thus described : Arms :
ermine, a fess chequy or and az;
crest: on a chapeau purpure turned
up erm. a wild boar passant or.
Tracing the line back to the sixteenth
century, we find that one Thomas
Arden, Esq., of Park Hall, Warwick-
shire was the first owner of Long-
crofts Hall, now the chief family
seat, and the immediate ancestor on
the maternal side of the greatest of
English poets and dramatists, Shake-
speare’s mother having been Mary
Arden, daughter of Sir Edward
Arden, of Park Hall. The name
frequently occurs in annals of differ-
ent eras, until we find it recorded
that Henry Arden, Esq., of Long-
crofts, was the father of the Rev.
John Arden, who was born in the
year 1752, and married to Margaret
Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph
Hamar, rear-admiral of the Royal
Navy. The Rev. John Arden died
in the year 1803, and of his large
family the eldest son, John, was a
major in the King’s Own Dragoons;
the second, Francis Edward, rector
of Gresham, Norfolk; the third,
Samuel, a major in the East India
Company’s service; and the fourth,
William, a member of civil life in
Barton-under-Needwood. Thomas,
the fifth son and the great-grand-
father of Mr. Arden, of “Bauhinia
Downs,” was in holy orders. His
sons were Edward Thomas, vicar of
Rangemore, Staffordshire, and Albert
Henry, vicar of Newhall, Derby-
shire, who was a missionary in
South India from 1864-74. To the
latter were born Edward Cooper,
Albert Henry, and John Henry
Morris Arden. Mr. Edward Cooper
Arden, at the time of Mr. E. T.
Arden’s birth, was temporarily resid-
ing in the United States of America,

having been largely interested in
wheat-growing in Minnesota. In
due course he returned with his
family to England, where, at Finch-
ley, London, and in the vicinity of
Torquay, Devon, he owns fairly large


estates. He has three sons, of whom
Mr. Arden, of "Bauhinia Downs,”
is the second, the eldest and youngest
being members of the R.A.S.C.,
with the ranks of major and brevet-
major, respectively. Mr. E. T.
Arden was educated at the famous
English public school at Repton,
which has been the Alma Mater of
an Arden, almost without a break,
since its foundation in the middle of
the sixteenth century, and from there
went to Bridgewater, in Somerset-
shire, in order to study - the prin-
ciples of stock-raising and pastoral
work generally. While at Bridge-
water he renewed acquaintance
with a schoolfellow, Mr. Livingston
Learmonth, whose father was man-
aging director of the firm of Dalgety
and Co., Ltd. Mr. Learmonth’s
representations of the potentialities
of Australia made him desirous of
testing the pastoral resources of this
country, and in the year 1912 he set
out for Central Queensland with
several introductory letters from his
friend. Shortly after his arrival he
accepted a post as jackaroo at
"Corona” Station, near Longreach,
where he obtained his first insight
into the industry as conducted in
Australia. After a year spent at
"Corona” he entered upon the
duties of a similar position at
"Bandon Grove,” a property situ-
ated in the Longreach district and
he contracted to take machinery to
"Austral Downs” from Duchess, and
it is worthy of mention that this
lorry was the first automobile to
complete the journey from Duchess,

adventure that the world has ever

the day preceding his departure from
Australia, devoted herself to the
work of the Y.A.D. in England.
Shortly after his return to Australia
he purchased "Bauhinia Downs”
and settled down to pastoral pursuits
on this property, which embraces an
area of 20,000 acres situated in the
vicinity of J ulia Creek, North-western
Queensland. Mr. Arden, who from
bis early school days has been a lover
of outdoor sport, is a member of the
Julia Creek Racing Club. While at
Repton he distinguished himself in
various athletic contests and repre-
sented his house in many competitive
games. He was a member of the
Repton Eleven of his year and won
the School Championship for boxing
during his last year of residence at
the college, continuing to indulge in
various forms of sport in the Mother-
land until the time of his departure
for Australia. Mr. Arden is a life
member of the Longreach Club. He
married in the year 1915 Ivy Essie,
daughter of Mr. John McNally, of
"Bandon Grove,” a Queensland
pioneer of the eighties and a member
of the third generation of a family
which was founded under the
Southern Cross in the very early days
of New South Wales by his grand-
father, who was associated in a pro-
fessional capacity with the found-
ation of the Australian Agricultural

keen motorist, he turned his predil-
ection for this pastime to a practical
purpose while at “Bandon Grove,”
purchasing a motor lorry, with which

year 1916 to the termination of the
war he was on active service with
the R.A.S.C. in France, and during
the same period Mrs. Arden, to

Mr. John McNally’s career will be
found in another portion of this
work. Mr. and Mrs. Arden have
one son, John Phillip Humphrey.


BYRNE BROS., Julia Creek,
North-western Queensland. The
founder of the Byrne family, which
is represented in the Flinders district
by the members of the above-named
MR. J. BYRNE.
firm, was the late John Byrne, who,
hailing from the City of Waterford,
Ireland, arrived at Port Jackson,
New South Wales, in the year 1863.
MR. C. S. BYRNE.
The late gentleman was a descendant
of very old farming stock, his for-
bears having held their own land
in Limerick for a period long past
the ken of the oldest inhabitant of
that County. Of Celtic origin, their
name is to be found among the oldest
collections of Irish folk lore and
figuring in connection with some of
the most stirring incidents which
brighten the pages of Irish history.
He was twenty-five years of age,
when, affected by the political
troubles of his native land and
prompted by the desire of visiting
the new world under the Southern
Cross, which, in the minds of the
adventurous, was at that time asso-
ciated with the romance and the
glamour of the early Victorian gold
discoveries, he decided to there carve
out an honourable and independent
career. The earliest record of his
doings in his adopted country show
that he was employed by the
descendants of John Macarthur,
founder of the wool-growing industry
in Australia. During his connection
with this family he was made
acquainted with the methods of con-
ducting pastoral operations on a
scientific basis—more particularly in
their relation to the sheep industry—
which at that time were a consider-
able advance on those in vogue in
the Old World. After spending
some years with the Macarthurs he
was engaged on the historic cattle
station known as “Combardelo,”
where he entered upon the many and
varied experiences of bush life in the
sixties. Towards the latter end of
that decade, in the hope of a more
rapid rise to fortune, he joined the
first rush to the newly-opened tin
mines at Inverell, then known as
Green Swamp. After a time devoted
to this industry his marriage
occurred, a circumstance which sug-
gested the desirability of making a
permanent home on the land, and
resulted in the selection of a block
of land on the boundary of
“Edgroi” and “Gurley” Stations,
the acquirement of which estab-
lished for him a record as the pioneer
selector of this part of the Mother
State. He grazed both sheep and
cattle on his holding, which he con-
ducted for over thirty years, gain-
ing a reputation not only in the
immediate neighbourhood but
throughout the whole of the then
Colony as one of the best stock judges
of the period. Previous to the 1902
drought he sold out his original
acquirement and purchased “Strath-
fillan,” a property in the dis-
trict outlying Inverell, which he
retained until the time of his death
in the year 1910. He was survived
by a family of eight sons and four
daughters. Five of the sons now
reside in Queensland, the four whose
careers come under the heading of

the year 1915, and immediately
identified themselves with the pas-
toral industry in the district out-
lying Julia Creek, being, early in
the same year, the first settlers in


this locality to acquire country from
resumed land thrown open for
selection to promote closer settle-
ment. Their property, which they
named “Innisfail,” consists of about
20,000 acres lying some 16 miles
from Julia Creek township. With
the realization of their country’s
need during the Great War, they
entered strenuously upon the task of
rapidly converting the run into a
going concern, so as to enable two of
the firm to take their place in the
firing line, and to such purpose was
their labour conducted, that before
the end of 1915 the homestead was
completed, the necessary fencing
erected, bore drains laid down, and
other developmental work accom-
plished. On October 8, in the same
year, leaving their interests in
“Innisfail,” in charge of their eldest
brother, whose work of production on
the land was assisted by the youngest
member of the firm, Mr. A. B. R.
Byrne, then at the age of sixteen,
Messrs. P. J. and C. S. Byrne pro-
ceeded to their native State and
joined the 33rd Battalion of the
Australian Imperial Forces. They
served together in France until the
first occasion at Messines and later
at Villers Bretonneux, where he was
also gassed. Both, on being dis-
charged from the army, returned to

their interests in “Innisfail,” they
entered upon separate enterprises in
its locality, one opening up a stock
and station agency business in Julia
Creek, and the other a butcher-
ing business. Mr. Michael Leonard
Byrne, the eldest member of
Byrne Bros., was born on Decem-
ber 9, 1886. He married in
the year 1915, May, daughter of Mr.
Frank Ooggan, of Inverell, New
South Wales. His brothers, Charles
Stuart, Patrick Joseph, and Ambrose
Bernard Richard, were born on
December 14, 1888, July 13, 1892,
and June 10, 1898, respectively. Mr.
C. S. Byrne was married in 1915 to
Mary, daughter of Mr. John Doyle,
Inverell, and Mr. P. J. Byrne to
Cecilia, daughter of Mr. Michael
Moran, of “Lorretta,” Cherry Tree

son of Mr. Richard Davis Jones, who
was one of the pioneer pastoral
managers of the early seventies, from

which period he dates a long associa-
tion with the Stock Department of
the Civil Service of the Mother
State, having previously been engaged
in the administration of a station
property on the Lachlan River
known as “North Barombil.” During
his long connection with the above-
mentioned branch of New South
Wales Governmental operations Mr.
Jones, sen., was occupied on the
advisory boards which dealt with
stock water supplies, the rabbit pest,
and similar matters, being finally
promoted to the Chief Inspectorship
of Stock. A native of Australia, and
now in his seventy-eighth year, he
represents a family which was
founded by his father in the days
when desirable immigrants from the
Old World were first fieely encouraged
to settle in the then little known
Continent in the Southern seas. He

Australian family, the Pearsons,
whose advent to the country dates
back to the early days of settlement
in the South, twelve children, ten
of whom survive, resulting from the
union. For the past decade he has
resided in retirement in Sydney.
His third son, Mr. Frank R. Jones,
was educated at the local school in
Condobolin in his native State. and
by private tuition at his father’s
home. At the age of fourteen,
putting school books aside, he entered
upon the career which was to occupy
his future energies, becoming a
general station hand on “Melrose
Plains,” a holding then in the
ownership of a prominent pastoralist
of the period, Mr. James Tout, with
whom he spent four or five years.
During that period he occupied the
several positions included in the
MAJOR C. W. LAVARACK

the kind, thus gaining an intimate
knowledge of stock and station work.

started on the roads as a drover, and,
in that capacity was, shortly after

further responsibility as adviser
at “Mount Boorithumble” was next
offered him, and he carried out
the duties incidental thereto for
post on “Gungahlan,” a notable
pastoral property near Duntroon.
At this period of his career he met
with a serious accident, which in-
capacitated him for some time. On
finally regaining his health he

eighteen months, when he resigned
to take over the work of shed over-
seer on “Melrose” Station, then under
the management of Mr. W. M.
Younger. Later he held a similar
overseer of this North - western
Queensland property early in the
following year. He remained in
Queensland until 1902, when he
returned to New South Wales *o
“Lerida,’’ and early in the following
year took the reins of control on
“Rockwood” Station, then in the
ownership of Messrs. Stewart Bros,
& McCaughey, which he managed


until this property was also disposed
of. While still engaged in the
management of “Rockwood,” he
took up two blocks of country on
“Dalgonally” resumption, and, on
severing his connection with the
former property, personally entered
upon the development of his own
venture (named “Cabanda,” after
the parish in which it is situ-
ated), and this rapidly demon-
strated the capable administration
and wide experience of the owner.
Mr. and Mrs. Jones, then newly
married, took possession of “Ca-
banda” in the true pioneering spirit,
residing in a tent until the fencing
and other essential improvements
were well under way. Within a year
of their arrival they settled in the
homestead, which, containing large,
well-ventilated rooms and surrounded
by verandahs, is a two-storied struc-
ture of modern architecture, in the
design and construction of which
climatic conditions were fully taken
into consideration. It occupies an
ideal site on a sand ridge, edging the
timbered country which comprises
a portion of the run. Both flower
and vegetable gardens have been
laid out in the grounds in its vicinity,
and add that lovely charm which
crowns all cultivation of this nature.
Mitchell and Flinders grass plains
occupy about two-thirds of the area,
the remainder being composed of a
mixture of timbered and edible scrub
land and broken sand ridges, a class
of country which is very favourably
regarded for its utility in dry seasons,
apart from its usefulness in provid-
ing shade for the stock. The average
rainfall at “Cabanda” is about 20
inches annually. Julia and Lara
Creeks course through the run and
provide it with good water, a large
hole in the bed of the latter affording
permanent supplies. These combined
sources are supplemented by bore
water, which is conveyed to the

several paddocks into which the run
is divided by means of drains which
traverse the property for about 25
miles. On account of its profusion
of fodder throughout different sea-
sons and the amplitude of its water
supply, “Cabanda” may be described
as embracing practically drought-
proof country. Devoted to sheep,
its flock lias been added to year by
year and numbers at time of writing
some 15,000, the rams in use being
of Southern stud blood. About 100
head of cattle and the same number
of horses are also carried on “Ca-
banda.” Mr. Jones was created a
Justice of the Peace by the Denham
Administration. Since his advent to
Queensland in the year 1903 he has
been more or less associated with
those public movements having for
their object the advancement of the
districts in which he has resided, or
instituted in the causes of patriotism
or charity. In sport he has promi-
nently supported amateur racing,
and for several years was vice-presi-
dent of the Muttaburra Race Club.
He has frequently entered the lists
in the Central district for the further-
ance of amateur sport, his colours
(violet and orange) repeatedly catch-
ing the judge’s eye. A close student
of political economy, he is strongly
antagonistic to those methods, which,
fostering party ends, have the effect
of impeding industrial progress by
choking all enterprise and hamper-
ing the efforts of the primary pro-
ducer. In the year 1912 Mr. Jones
married Alice Muriel, a daughter of
Major Cecil Wallace Lavarack, J.P.
As a student at the Brisbane Girls’
Grammar School she passed the
Sydney Junior and Senior University
Examinations, and, proceeding to
Melbourne in the year 1902, entered
upon a course at the Trinity College.

Her father, Major Lavarack, is de-
scended from old English stock of
Lancashire origin. He arrived in
Australia in the seventies, and, after
spending some time as a jackaroo on
a pastoral property, was for many
subsequent years connected with the
Metropolitan Lands Office. In the
MR. D. M. LAVARACK
year 1912 he brought his family to
"Consentes,” where he resided until
the sale of the property to Mr.
Doubleday, an event which was fol-
lowed by his retirement to Victoria.
When in England he was attached
to the regular British Army, and for
many years was connected with mili-
tary affairs in Queensland, his know-
ledge, interest, and enthusiasm being
largely instrumental in bringing the
Queensland Volunteer movement to
a successful issue. He attained his
majority as a member of the Queens-
land Field Artillery. Of his sons,
the eldest, Sidney Reginald R.
Lavarack, is engaged as a draughts-
man with the well-known Brisbane
firm of Yates & Jones. The three
next in order of age, Lieutenant-
Colonel John Dudley, Kenneth Wal-
lace, and Edgar Lancelot Lavarack,
served the Empire with distinc-
tion during the titanic struggle for
national liberty which engaged the
Great Powers of the world during
the years 1914-18. The first-men-
tioned, previous to the declaration of
hostilities, was a member of the
Queensland Permanent Forces, and,
continuing his military career in the
firing line, was in the thick of
operations both in Salonica and
France, being four times mentioned
in despatches during the campaigns
and finally awarded the Distin-
guished Service Order. Soon after
the termination of the war he was
created C.M.G. Plis brother, Ken-
neth Wallace, is the recipient of the
Military Medal, an honour for which
he was recommended on four different
occasions. Both Messrs. K. W. and
E. L. Lavarack (the latter having
served in France until peace was con-
cluded) are now interested in landed
pursuits, playing their part out back
as pioneers of their generation. Of
the union of Mr. and Mrs. Jones
there is a family of two sons and two
daughters.
WILLIAM HENRY HELP-
MAN, J.P., “Fishers’ Creek,” Clon-
curry was born in Warrnambool, in
the Western district of Victoria, on
October 12, 1860, and is a descendant
of an old English family whose
interests and associations have for
many generations lain in Devonshire.
He is the fourth son of the late Cap-
tain Benjamin Frank Helpman,
R.N., who, as an officer of the
Imperial Naval Service, completed
important surveys on the North-west
coast of the Continent during the
years 1838-41. The work of Cap-
tain (then Lieutenant) Helpman was
accomplished in the face of hostilities
from the warlike natives who peopled
the banks of the Gascoyne, rendering
pioneering an exceptionally hazard-
ous task at the time of the original
exploration of this part of Western
Australia. Such men, however,
generally prove true to the traditions
of their race—which, in the case of
the Helpman family, were born of
many stirring incidents connected
with the naval history of England
from the time of Admiral Blake on-
wards—-and Captain Helpman proved
no exception to the rule. Various
of his progenitors commanded in the
wooden walls of old England under
the flag that still proudly proclaims
their country mistress of all the seas,
and assisted in the naval defence
of the Empire down to recent
times. On his retirement from the
Navy, Captain Helpman settled in
Warrnambool, where he resided until
his death in the year 1870. He mar-
ried a member of the Pace family,
and, his wife being a sister of Mrs.
S. G. Henty, thus became connected
with the Hentys, one of the most
historic and important families in
Y ictoria. Both the Pace and Henty
families were notably identified with
the early settlement of that and the
Western State, contributing in no

history of the country. They were
prominently associated with the
settlement and development of
Northam, Western Australia. The
founder of the Pace family under
the Southern Cross (the grandfather
of the subject of this memoir) was
formerly an officer in the East India
Service. The Helpman family was
well known in Victoria, and at the
time of their father’s death the
elder sons had made good in various
walks of life. Mr. William H. Help-

age. He was educated at the
Warrnambool Grammar School, and
attended that institution until attain-
ing the age of fourteen, when he
entered the office of a Civil Engineer.
Possessing a temperament to which
the open-air life of the bush strongly
appealed, he devoted less than a year


to office life, journeying to Queens-
land on relinquishing his first post
and shortly becoming installed as a
general stock hand at "Woma,” then
an important pastoral holding of
large acreage, under the manage-
ment and part ownership of the late
Stewart Mitchell. Pastoral pursuits
in Queensland have since occupied
his energies, and in the period of
forty-five years which has elapsed
since his advent to the then Colony,
he has filled various positions in
the industry. For twenty years he
was in the service of the Chirnsides.
He has held several managerial posi-
tions, "Clonagh” and "Byromine”
being among the properties which he
has controlled. In the year 1913 he
launched out on his own account,
taking up his present leasehold, to
the administration of which he has
since exclusively devoted himself,
inaugurating and completing the
many improvements necessary for
the successful working of a grazing
concern. The "Fishers’ Creek” pro-
perty is made up of mixed country,

ties, being only eighteen miles
distant from Clcncurry, while the
depastures both flocks and herds.
The owner also goes in for horse-
breeding and generally has stock
available for market. Mr. Helpman
has long exercised magisterial duties,
having been gazetted a Justice of
the Peace about a quarter of a cen-
tury ago. He married in the year
1892 Margaret, daughter of the late
James Clough, a member of a family
whose establishment in Durham
dates far back in the history of that
County. Mr. Clough settled in
South-western Queensland in the dis-
trict forming the Moonie River
watershed, in the early sixties, and
for many years was engaged in
station work. Finally he established
himself in the carrying business, in
which calling he was one of the best-
known figures in the district with
which he was identified for so many
years. Of the union there is a son,
Walter Edwin, who, born in Winton,
Queensland, on February 15, 1893,
was educated at the Townsville
Grammar School. On the termina-

Queensland have been spread over
more than half a century. Born in
the year 1849 Mr. Terry, sen., is a

at the age of fifteen on
Yaamba” Station, under the
auspices of his maternal uncle, the
late P. F. Macdonald, another
notable pastoralist whose enterprise
was closely interwoven with the his-
tory of the State. For some time Mr.
A. J. MacD. Terry was engaged in
the management of “Fernlees” on
behalf of Mr. Macdonald, who took
up the property with several other
areas in the fifties during a journey
of exploration into the Never-Never
west of Rockhampton. Being
strongly imbued with the same spirit
which prompted his uncle and inen
of similar calibre to achieve so much
in the way of discovery, Mr. Terry
made his way to the Kennedy dis-
trict in 1870, and there took up
Eton Vale,” one of the oldest pro-
perties in the vicinity of Bowen,
Northern Queensland. He carried on
Eton Vale” as a cattle proposition
for about twelve years, selling it in
1882 and purchasing “Blenheim” in
the same district, which a few years
later he also disposed of. After a
period spent in retirement he once
more actively interested himself in
pastoral enterprise in the North, pur-
chasing “Kirknie,” an area covering
80,000 acres, which he retained for
several years, selling it in 1910. He
embarked upon another venture four
years later, purchasing “Inkerman,”
where during his lifetime the late
gentleman for long followed grazing
and agrarian pursuits. To Mr. and
Mrs. Terry, sen., were born three
sons and four daughters. Mr. L. V.

B. Terry pursued his education at

years of his life were spent. As in

knowledge of the industry with his
growing perceptions, and long ere
reaching his teens was able to render
useful assistance in handling stock.


He continued with his brothers to
carry out his share of the work on
“Kirknie” until arriving at the age
of twenty-nine, when he entered
upon the administration of “Laurel
Vale,” a Western property then
recently purchased by the Terry
family, and in which he had bought
a half interest. That was in 1909,
and for the following seven years he
conducted operations on this station,
which afforded him his first practical
acquaintance with the sheep in-
dustry, a phase of pastoral activity
in which he became expert in the
course of his duties here as managing
owner. After being brought to a
good standard of development
“Laurel Vale” was sold, and the
partnership formed on its acquire-
ment mutually dissolved, a circum-
stance which was immediately fol-
lowed by Mr. L. V. B. Terry’s
entry into the industry solely on
introduction of rams from “Coo-
nong”etud. The herd was raised from
well-selected shorthorn breeders. In
initiating the work of development
Mr. Terry’s first consideration was
the erection of the subdivisional and
the repairing and completion of the
boundary fencing. The run is amply
watered by means of a flowing
artesian bore which was put down
when the land was leased as part of
“Eddington” Station, its output
being supplied to the stock through
several miles of bore drains and in
the McKinlay River, where it sup-
plements the natural supply, keep-
ing that stream constantly running
in its course through “Strathbyrne.”
Other sources of water supply are
contained in Gidya Creek, which
also intersects the property. Mr.

tuted in the interests of the district
and community and is a strong
possession of our pioneers, laid the
foundations of settlement in the

St. James’ Cathedral, Melbourne, to
Emily, daughter of the late Capt.
11. J. White, one of the early arrivals
in Victoria, who afterwards took up
a large pastoral property on the
Murray River. Mr. Marron’s family
consisted of two sons and two daugh-
ters. Of the sons William Henry,
the elder, is at time of writing
engaged in the administration of
“Roxmere,” and the younger,
Thomas Richard, is the owner of a
sugar-growing proposition. Mr. T.
R. Marron was among the 1914
heroes of the Great War, being
wounded at the Gallipoli landing.
He was invalided to Australia, and

Forces and served in Egypt as a

near Gilliat. He secured the latter
property, which previously was in-
cluded in the leasehold of “Edding-
ton Station,” in the year 1916 by
ballot, and immediately entered into
its possession, inaugurating a scheme
of development which has added con-
siderably to the natural advantages
with which the area is endowed.
“Strathbyrne” embraces over
20,000 acres of open downs lying
sixteen miles south-west of Gilliat,
a township situated on the Great
Northern railway. Well clothed with
Mitchell and Flinders grasses and
nicely shaded on the water front-

Emily May, second daughter of Mr.
Thomas Marron, the proprietor of
“Roxmere,” which, situated near
Townsville, is one of the oldest cattle
settlements in the North, and has
been in the same ownership for
nearly a quarter of a century. Mr.
Marron, who is by birth an Irishman
and now over eighty years of age,
was one of the earliest arrivals on
the Ravenswood field, pioneering the
mining industry there in the very
early sixties when canvas roofs
thickly dotted the site of the present
town and sheltered the multitudes
drawn thither by the never-failing

JAMES ADAM BLAIR, “Maori
Downs,” Gilliat, North-western
Queensland, was born at Kakanui,
in the Oamaru district of New Zea-
land, on September 26, 1887, and is
the eldest son of the late Robert
Blair, who, a Scotsman and scion of
an old Scottish family, arrived in
New Zealand from Ayr, his birth-
place, in the late seventies. For some
time following his advent to the
Dominion Mr. Blair, sen., was
engaged in the meat trade and
subsequently in the manufacture of
preserved milk. He died in the year
1894 and was survived by a widow,
three sons and a daughter. Shortly
after his decease his family voyaged
to Queensland, where, subsequently,
two of his sons became engaged in
the pastoral industry. The death
of the third son, Stuart Wilson,
occurred in the State. The second
son, Robert Johnston Blair, who
was born on October 21, 1888,


represented the family in the firing
line during the great struggle of
1914-18, serving with the Australian
Imperial Forces in France, where he
participated in various of the
engagements in which our soldiers

established a record for high courage,
endurance, and resourcefulness. Mr.
J. A. Blair, of “Maori Downs,”
completed his scholastic studies in
Maryborough. Here he occupied
his first position in the establishment
of Wilson, Hart & Co., the well-
known firm of sawmillers and timber
merchants, of which his uncle, the
late Hon. A. H. Wilson, M.L.C.,
was at that time one of the
principals. The appeal of the bush,
however, found in him a ready

Griffin, he received a thorough
grounding in the industry. In
the year 1917 he entered the
industry on his own account, taking
up his present homestead block, an
area of 22,000 acres eminently suited
for the pasturage of both sheep and
cattle. This property, which he

MAXMILIAN OLIVE, “Olive

1871, and is the eldest son of the
late Charles Olive, who, formerly a

noted wine distiller of that well-
known port of the Mediterranean,
was descended from a family whose
interests were centred in the wine
business for generations. Mr. M.
Olive, who was educated in his
native city, left school when at the
Renaux, in the long voyage which
was the preliminary step towards
settlement under the Southern Cross.
He landed in Melbourne in 1887,
and having determined to accept the
first work that offered, proceeded to
the Tweed River district, where he
became employed in a butchering
establishment. With the realization
that his greatest chance of ultimate
success lay in pastoral avocations,
which would afford him the ex-
perience that is so essential a part
of the equipment of a man having
as a final objective an independent
career as a producer, he shortly
journeyed to Queensland, where,
within a year of his arrival in the
country, he became employed in
general station work, in which he
shortly became expert, acquiring
considerable proficiency as a shearer
in the years which followed his
advent to the Northern State. In
this capacity he became a well-known
figure in all the largest sheds of the
Barcoo, Gregory, and other districts
of the West and North, a stand being
always at his command in the shear-
ing season. Having amassed, by
dint of unflagging industry and
much (sacrifice, sufficient capital lo

up with rams bred on “Toorak”
Station. The homestead, which is
modern in design and well ventilated,
is situated in the midst of most


picturesque surroundings some eight
miles from McKinlay, and contains
the many comforts which transform
a mere dwelling into a very desirable
home. Mr. Olive was married in
the year 1899 bo Annie, daughter of
the late Mark Rooney, a member of
an old and highly respected North of
Ireland family, which for many
generations continued to be identi-
fied with landed pursuits on their

GEORGE EDWARD STANLEY,
“Boanda,” McKinlay, was born in
Adelaide, South Australia, on July
14, 1858, and is the eldest son of
the late George Henry Stanley, who,
a native of Devonshire, England,
and a descendant of an old family
which followed agricultural ‘pur-
suits for many generations, decided
as a young man to carve a
career in Australia. The late gentle-
man, who was a veterinary surgeon,
chose Adelaide as the centre of his
future activities, at a time when
South Australia was in its infancy
as a Colony, and immediately became
occupied with the duties of his
profession, continuing to practise in
that city until the time of his death,
half a century later. His eldest son,
Mr. George Edward Stanley, was a
of the Glenelg Railway Company.
On completing two years in this
service he decided that a shorter
road to independence lay in the
pastoral industry, and being strongly

attracted by the free open-air life
which is its accompaniment, resigned
his earlier appointment in the
seventies and secured a post with a
droving party then setting out from
Adelaide in charge of horses destined
billet on the roads with fat bullocks
for the Adelaide markets. Shortly
after his return to Adelaide, having
formed a very favourable opinion of
the potentialities of Queensland
during his brief visit, he again set out
for the then Colony. Immediately on
his arrival he entered upon a busy
droving career, during which he
travelled several mobs of cattle and
horses over the various western and
southern stock routes of the State,
becoming in the course of his duties
well known as a charge hand to the
station holders and selectors whose
interests were centred in the district
through which he passed. Be
celebrated his twenty-first birthday
in 1879 en route to “Devonport”
Station, on the Diamantina River,
in the Far West of the State, when
travelling heifers to that holding
from “Burrenbilla,” near Cunna-
mulla. He carried on droving
and other station avocations,
chiefly among stock, for the fol-
lowing fourteen years, eventu-
ally establishing himself in the
Burke district, where, in 1893, he
launched into commercial life as
“mine host” of the McKinlay Hotel.
While conducting his business in
McKinlay he again undertook drov-
ing contracts, chiefly on behalf of
the well-known firm of Collins,
White & Co., his journeys during
this period being over the western
stock routes. In the year 1908 he

station situated on Campbell’s Creek,
in Queensland. The trip occupied
fourteen weeks, and on its comple-
tion he was offered and accepted a
sold out his interests in McKinlay
and built an hotel in Selwyn, then
in the height of its prosperity as a
copper-bearing centre. While resid-
ing here he successfully speculated


in the mining industry, purchasing
an interest in the Belgium mine.
Eight year’s later he returned to
pastoral pursuits as the owner of
“Boanda,” his present property,
which is situated 70 miles from
Gilliat, the nearest railway station,
and 22 miles from McKinlay town-
ship. He secured “Boanda” by
ballot in 1916, and immediately
entered into residence on the pro-
perty and applied himself to its
development. The important matter
of water production claimed his
earliest attention, and he secured a
fine supply by sinking a bore, the
output of which is received by a
33,000 gallon tank, and made avail-
able for the stock in 200 feet of
troughing. Having thus ensured
the safety of the run in the matter
of water conservation, he erected the
28 miles of fencing which defines the
boundaries and subdivides the area
into the requisite number of pad-
docks. Nicely shaded, open gidya

cate the character of “Boanda,”
which, embracing an area of 20,000
acres, is well clothed with Mitchell
and Flinders grasses. The McKinlay
River, the Four-mile and

run, a good natural water supply
being retained in several large holes
in the creeks. At time of writing

progeny of “Afton Downs” bulls,
which bear a notable reputation for
type and conformation all over the
North. As further indicating the
wisdom of Mr. Stanley’s choice and
his up-to-date methods of breeding,
w© may mention that his stock are in
instituted in the interests of the
district or community. For twenty-
two years he filled a seat on the
board of the McKinlay Shir© Council
and was three times chairman of
that body. He has also interested
himself largely in matters of
charitable and patriotic import, and
was identified with the foundation of
the Selwyn Hospital, of which
institution he is a committeeman and
life governor. An adherent of clean
sport, he was for some time honorary
secretary of the local racing body,
which owes a great deal to his
interest and energy. He married
in the year 1893 Mary Madeline,
daughter of the late Edward
O’Sullivan, who, hailing from the
Emerald Isle, was a well-known
furrier in Sydney, and subsequently
—about half a century ago —in
Queensland. The late gentleman’s
sons were amongst the original
pioneers of Western Queensland and
prominent in their day as pastoral
managers. “Mount Merlin” Station
was managed by Mr. Daniel
O’Sullivan on behalf of Messrs. John
Collins & Sons for over twenty years,
and here he died and was buried.
His brother, Thomas, administered
“Strathfield” for the firm of Collins,

these speaks volumes for the expert
knowledge of horned stock, which,
as the result of a wide sphere of
experience, is the possession of their
constant demand. During his
residence in McKinlay, and later in

public-spiritedness which still ani-
mates his support of all movements

posts 'throughout several successive
generations of their line. The late
gentleman was steward and game-
keeper for the Earl of Eglington for
over a quarter of a century. Mr.
W. M. Allison was educated at the
public school of Kilmarnock, which
he attended until attaining his teens,
shortly afterwards being apprenticed
to the engine-fitting trade. He
continued in the same calling from
his fourteenth to his eighteenth year,
finally determining to strike out for
himself in Australia, the incentives
contained in the country’s need of
population and in its marvellous
resources prompting him to work
out his destiny in the heart of the
vast wilderness known as the
Australian bush. Endowed with
health, strength, and resolution, and
encouraged with the hope of an
ultimately successful career in such
an environment, and strongly
attracted also by its freedom from
the conventionalities of a closely-
packed civilization, he embarked
aboard the sailing ship “Selkirk-
shire,” and concluded the voyage
from the Old World at Rockhamp-
ton on November 2, 1882. From
there he proceeded west to Barcal-
dine, obtaining a post as a general
hand on “Saltern Creek” Station,
near that centre. On “Saltern
Creek” he rapidly familiarized him-
self with new conditions, and at the
end of twelve months removed to the
district outlying Hughenden, where
for several years he followed a
multiplicity of occupations, includ-
ing general station work, droving,
dam-making, kangaroo shooting,
etc., etc., becoming au fait with the
technicalities of them all. In the
year 1895 he was offered and
accepted a settled position as
engineer and manager of the Hugh-
enden waterworks scheme, and
carried out the duties incidental to
this post for fourteen years, resigning
in 1910 to essay on a small grazing
venture on a temporary leasehold,
which he conducted for a short time
only. lie next selected “Mucha,”
now known as “Terang,” a holding
occupying country between Torrens
Creek and Pentland, and is recorded
as having introduced the first sheep

The administration of “Mucha”
occupied his energies until his
acquirement of “Ivy Downs,” his
present homestead block, which he
named in compliment to the only
daughter of the Hon. Charles
McDonald, a gentleman with whom
he holds pastoral interests and for
whom he entertains a warm regard
that has grown with friendship of
over twenty-five years’ standing.
Soon after taking up “Ivy Downs”
he entered into its possession, and
with his family, has since resided
there, earning as the outcome of his
public-spiritedness a reputation as

Other instances of his active partici-
pation in the communal life are
shown in his prominent connection
with various movements, such as the
local school committee (of which he
is treasurer), etc. instituted in the
the various patriotic and charitable
movements inaugurated in that
town. An enthusiastic 1 member of
the Oddfellows’ Fraternity, he acted
as secretary for that body at
Hughenden for seven years. He has
for long exercised the Commission >f

hands of the Kidston Administra-

present century. In McKinlay sport-
ing circles he is also to the fore as
a committeeman of the local amateur
race club. Mr. Allison married in
the year 1897 Jeanie, fifth daughter
of the late A. W. H. Kirkland, a
scion of an old Scottish family of
Stirlingshire, which included among
its members the renowned explorer,
David Livingstone, and of the union

HARRY WILLIAM PRING,
“Boanda Park,” McKinlay, was
born at Roma, Queensland, on
September 7, 1883, and is the second
eon of Mr. George Theodore Charles
Pring, a pioneer who, hailing from
Central Europe, arrived in Queens-
land ere the dawn of independence
and was identified with the march of
events which witnessed the founda-
tion and development of the Colony
and subsequently the establishment
and progress of the State, the whole
period of his activities down to the
present day covering well nigh
seventy years. Political changes
whose far-reaching consequences
were charged with grave menace to
national life, and of which the recent
agitation of 1914-18 was the out-
come, caused him to severe old ties
and start life in a country famed for
its adherence to the great British
principle of liberty for the people,
a principle which has drawn many
hard-working and useful settlers to
our shores. He set out for
Australia in 1852 and landed in
Brisbane in June of that year.
Having resolved to settle down to
his new surroundings by taking the
first employment that offered he was
of the late David Cannon McConnel,
the founder of “Cressbrook” Station.
He was engaged at “Cressbrook” for

a considerable period, making him-
self generally useful, not only
amongst the stock, but in connection

he followed a variety of bush
occupations on behalf of other
owners, eventually drifting to the
Maranoa district, where he started
on his own account as a carrier. He
followed this calling for a number
of years, gaining the respect and
goodwill of the landowners with
whom he had dealings for his
integrity, reliability, and industry,
characteristics for which he has bean
distinguished throughout the whole
of his long sojourn in the country.
In the early nineties he purchased a
selection near Roma, and thence-
forward for thirty years has carried
on as a grazier. By his first wife,
nee Elizabeth Mary Edwards, who,
of English birth, hailed from Lon-
don, he has a surviving family of
three sons and two daughters. The
death of this lady occurred in the
year 1892, and some years later Mr.
Pring re-married, the second union
being without issue. Mr. H. W.
Pring, of “Boanda Park,” received
such education as was possible at the
time and under the circumstances in
which his people were placed, at
home, when the day’s labour was
over, and, when slackness of work on

soon engaged in the conveyance of
bricks across the Brisbane River.
Subsequently he entered the service
with the developmental operations
which were being carried out at that
time, such as water conservation, the
the hom© acres permitted, at the
Roma State School. Before reach-
ing his teens he was contributing a


man’s share towards the working of
the selection and was thus employed
until reaching the age of twenty,
when he left the paternal rooftree,
starting out for the Winton district
in company with his elder brother.
There the two became engaged in
general bush work on a partnership
basis, which continued until 1910,
when the connection was mutually
dissolved. During the following five
years the subject of our memoir
undertook and completed a very
large amount of developmental work
under contract on different holdings
in the vicinity of Winton and

having witnessed the completion of
the fencing which forms its bound-
aries and subdivides the run into
four paddocks and the provision of
a plentiful water supply from three
sub-artesian bores which have been
put down under his direction.
Further development in connection
with the water scheme is in course
of progress. Some 24,000 acres of

Mr. Shute is a native of the Darling
Downs, Queensland. He has fol-
lowed station avocations since his
boyhood and is now nearly three
score years. For a considerable
part of his life he has been
engaged in contract work in tne
district outlying Muttaburra, and is
one of the best-known identities of
that locality. Mrs. Pring’s first
marriage occurred in the year 1902,
the union producing one son. It

soon as he had erected the building
which, fulfilling immediate needs
and being rendered quite comfort-
able despite its limited dimensions,
serves as his home until the near
future sees the completion of a
modern residence, he inaugurated a
scheme embodying the more essential
improvements, such as the making
and conservation of water, the
erection of fences etc. He has now
got these operations well in hand,

originally stocked the area with a
small mob of mixed cattle and with
these as a basis started breeding on
up-to-date lines, exercising the care
and discrimination that has resulted
in the production of the large-
framed and well-shaped beasts com-
prising the present herd, which,
averaging about 800 head, includes
a mob of young breeders. The

Less than ten years ago Mr. Pring’s
financial assets consisted of £3O and
his liahilties of five times that figure,
yet by the exercise of much sacrifice
and the qualities enumerated above
he has made good and shown what
may be achieved by the man who
has the grit and determination as
well as the desire to succeed.


HENRY HULBERT, “Wyn-
berg,” Oorindi, North-western
Queensland, was born in Townsville
on February 27, 1874, and is the sec-
ond son of the late Alfred Hnlbert,
THE LATE A. HULBERT.
who, born in Bristol, England, in
1843, is a descendant of old English
stock, the Hulberts having long dwelt
in and around Bristol, where for
several generations successive mem-
bers of the family engaged in the
butchering trade. While yet in his
teens, Mr. Alfred Hulbert, realizing
that Australia offered better pros-
pects of livelihood than were to be
found in his native land, and
actuated, doubtless, by that spirit of
adventure which has prompted so
much in the way of pioneering
achievement, set sail for the Island
Continent, arriving in Sydney in the
early sixties. Here he entered upon
commercial pursuits, from which he
was shortly distracted by the fascinat-
ing lure of the goldfields, becoming,
soon after his advent to the country,
one of the early searchers of the
yellow metal in Victoria. He worked
at the Bendigo diggings and on
various other fields and came to
Bowen, Queensland, in 1863. From
there he proceeded to Townsville,
and thence to “Lammermoor”
Station with Mr. Christensen, to
stock that property. He was con-
nected with the development of
the mining town of Ravenswood
and the establishment of vari-
ous institutions there as far back
as the early seventies. In the
year 1875, making Townsville his
headquarters, he started in the
carrying trade, and became well
known to the settlers whose holdings
were scattered in the district out-
lying that town for a couple of hun-
dred miles from the coast. While
operating as a carrier, he, in 1881,
established a record by crossing over
eighty miles of what was then a
waterless tract of country with two
bullock teams and a loading for
Winton, one of the teams being used
for the conveyance of the water and
rations needed for man and beast on
the journey, which, accomplished
with lighter equipment, would have
been regarded as an exceptional
feat. Such instances as these serve
to illustrate the difficult conditions
MR. H. HULBERT.
which were faced and overcome by
Queensland’s pioneers. The late Mr.
Hulbert carried on with his teams
until the year 1883, when he trans-
ferred his interests to the hotel trade,
becoming “mine host” of the Camp
Hotel, near Maxwelton. That was
prior to the advent of the railway,
and the crossing of the Flinders
nearest to his hostelry, which occu-
pied a site on the main road from
Cloncurry to the coast, has ever
since been known as Hulbert’s Cross-
ing. The place, which in those days
was a landmark, was carried on by
Mr. Hulbert until his retirement,
when it was taken over by members
of his family who held it for some
time after his death, which occurred
in the late fifties. Mr. Henry Hul-
bert was still a child when his father
became proprietor of the Camp, and
there his education was conducted
under a governess residing at the
hotel. In the intervals of study
much of his time was spent in out-
door occupation, his father having
been interested to a large extent in
horse-breeding while engaged in the
hotel business. As he grew older*,
being strongly attracted by the open-
air life of the bush, he left the
parental rooftree and took a position
with Mr. Robert Crothers, by whom
he was employed as one of a droving
party commissioned to travel cattle
to New South Wales. During the
several years he was in the service
of Mr. Crothers (his only employer)
he filled the various positions gener-
ally relegated to a station hand, and
was thoroughly equipped with a
practical knowledge of the industry
when, in 1898, he left that gentle-
man’s service and entered the
industry on his own account on a
block of land near Clutha. Being
overtaken by the disastrous drought
of 1901-3, however, the venture
turned out unfortunately, Mr. Hul-
bert sharing the fate of many

long-established pastoralists, and
being faced with the necessity of
making a fresh start. Accordingly,
he went to Cloncurry and there
opened a butchering business, which


he conducted for two and a half
years, at the end of which period he
sold out in order to purchase an hotel
at Mount Elliott, the first establish-
ment of its kind on that field. For

the following three years he con-

house, finally selling out to take over
the Great Western Hotel, in Hughen-
den. Having resolved to again
embark upon pastoral enterprise, he
of this area, which is named
“Wynberg,” has since occupied his
time and attention. Originally he
held “Wynberg” in partnership with
Mr. W. M. Mclntosh, but since that
gentleman’s retirement in the year
1918, he has continued in sole owner-
ship. Embracing some 40,000 ecres
of mixed country, the run is emi-
nently suited to either sheep or
cattle, producing a luxuriant growth
of Mitchell and Flinders grasses and
being well timbered, chiefly with
gidya. It carries on an average
about 10,000 sheep, but will have a
considerably increased capacity when
the development now iin course of
progress is completed. Besides the
flock, about 300 bead of cattle and
a number of horses are depastured
on “Wynberg.” Originally con-
structed as a private home in
Charters Towers, the homestead was
re-erected on “Wynberg” on a pic-
turesque site commanding park-like
vistas of open country and timbered
land. It stands on high piles and is
a most comfortable, airy, and well
ventilated structure, and ideally
suited to the conditions incidental
to the Western climate. Mr. Hulbert
has always kept abreast of the times,
taking a keen interest in those
movements and innovations which
have tended to the development or
progress of the industry to which be
has devoted so many years. He has

JOHN LOBSTON, J.P., pro-
prietor of “Leila Vale,” near Clon-
curry, and one of the successful
graziers of the district outlying that
most progressive pastoral centre.
MR. J. LOBSTON.
Mr. Lobston’s success is due to his
own initiative and foresight, his
first step in the direction of pas-
toral enterprise being taken with
the purchase of “Undilla” while
engaged in the conduct of the Prince
of Wales Hotel, the lease of which
residence there embarked on the
pastoral venture already referred to,
“Undilla” being a cattle and horse
station in the Camooweal district.
At about this time he took up

property, which includes 30,000 odd

stocked this area, adding consider-
ably to its improvements. “Undilla”
was sold in 1915 to Mr. T. Quilty.

acquired on a partnership basis.

he purchased in the year 1894 for
a sum approximating £l5O. He
conducted this establishment for the
following sixteen years, having in
the interim purchased the property
outright, and towards the end of his
acquired “Leila Vale,” a station
which is eminently adapted for the
pasturage of woolly or horned stock,

timber is present, gidya being the
predominating variety. Both sheep
and cattle are depastured on the
area, the flock approximating, in an
ordinary year, a strength of 20,000,
while the herd, which is composed of


shorthorns, averages about 300 head.
“Leila Vale” is well provided for in
the matter of water conservation, the
improvements including four flowing
artesian bores, from which supplies
are distributed over the nine
conveniently-arranged paddocks into
which the run is divided. Three of
these bores were sunk under the
regime of the present owner. Tire
property is most favourably situated
in regard to railway facilities, the
homestead occupying a site less than
100 yards from Gilmore, a siding on
the Queensland Northern Railway
standing 46 miles east of Cloncurry
and 435 miles west of Townsville on
the same line. The proximity of
Gilmore, which was named after the
previous owner of “Leila Vale,”
eliminates all the extra handling
involved in the loading of wool for
cartage over longer distances.
Possessing a picturesque as well as
a utilitarian aspect, the home stands
within a few yards of a large flowing
bore that adds its quota to the
attractiveness of the grounds, which
are decorated with parkinsonia and
acacia trees. About six rooms and
staff quarters are contained in the
main building, the inner arrange-
ments of which are most up-to-date
and convenient in every detail. The
outbuildings are in keeping with the
other improvements on the property
and include a woolshed which,
containing ten stands fitted with
Wolseley shearing machines, is most
modern in structure and equipment.
In the year 1915 Mr. Lobston
extended his pastoral operations to
the Northern Territory, purchasing
in partnership with Mr. H. Alman,
a property embracing 2,000 square
miles of country situated on the
Lemaon River, its name being taken
from aboriginal nomenclature and
signifying “Big Waterhole.” “Tana-
barinie” now carries a fine
shorthorn herd comprising about
8,000 head. The partners also
purchased “Roxmere” Station, near
Cloncurry, in 1915, and in the
following year took up “Linda
Downs,” in the Georgina River
district. “Roxmere” was disposed
of some three years after its acquire-
ment. “Linda Downs,” which
adjoins “Carrandotta” and “Walgra”
Stations, is a property of 720 square
miles, and is capable of depasturing
a herd of 8,000 head, which is the

number usually carried, though at
time of writing the area is used
as a fattening depot. When it came
into the hands of Messrs. Lobston
and Alman it was what is described
as a “dry run”—that is, one lacking
permanent water —but under their
ownership this defect was soon
obviated, a scheme of development
which was immediately inaugurated
having included the production and
conservation of artificial supplies.
In the year 1918 the firm engaged
in a fresh venture by the purchase
of “McArthur River,” a station
lying some 650 miles west of
Cloncurry, and consisting approxi-
mately of a square mileage of 4,000,

grown on these vast pastures being
eventually despatched to “Linda

a year, and then sent to the meat

Messrs. Lobston and Alman number
some 25,000 head. The sires used are

being acclimatized, they easily
succumb to the tick pest which is
prevalent in this locality. Mr.
Lobston is a member of the Masonic
craft. While resident in Cloncurry
he was recognised as a leading spirit
in all progressive movements and
was actively identified with the local
government, having been for some
years chairman of the Shire Council.
He was president of the local
hospital, and, for the duration of the
war, of the committee which dealt
with the local patriotic fund.
Among other offices which he has
filled is that of Chairman of
Commerce and Mines. At time of
writing he is a • member of the
local committee of the United
Pastoralists’ and Grazing Farmers’
Association. A prominent racing
man, be is a member of the North
Queensland Amateur Turf Club,
and of Tattersalls Club, Brisbane,
and always has a good horse carrying
silk. Of his blood stock, “Maltgilla”
deserves special mention as having
won five events in Sydney during the
year 1920. “Maltgilla” was sired
by the great racer, “Malt King ”
his dam being “Noogilla,” by
“Machine Gun,” from “Maxina,”
by “Havoc,” from “Georgina,”
by “Moorthorpe,” from “Georgina
Frederica” (imp.), by '‘George
Frederick,” from ‘‘Phoebe,” by
‘‘Blair Athol.” ‘‘Miss Lila,”
full sister to “Maltgilla ” is
also a ‘‘Leila Vale” horse. In
the year 1894 Mr. Lobston
married Eliza Matilda, daughter of
the late John Absalom, who was
one of the pioneers of Western
Queensland, and is recalled in
association with the very early days
of the Mackay district, where he was
engaged in copper-mining in part-
nership with his brother and the
present Earl of Winchester. Of the
union there is a family of two sons
and four daughters.
The Messrs. ROYLE BROS.,
“Menin Downs,” Middleton, Win-
ton, are sons of the late Charles
John Royle, who, hailing from
London, landed in Sydney in the
early eighties, being at that time a
man in middle life. The late
gentleman came of a family which,
in the course of several generations,
distributed its branches in different
parts of the Motherland, flourishing
in the great metropolis and in
Devonshire and adjacent counties.
Shortly after his arrival in Australia
he settled as a landowner near
Wagga Wagga, and resided there for
some time, subsequently removing to
Sydney. His investments included
large interests in and around Cairns,
Northern Queensland. For more
than a quarter of a century he was
engaged in commercial pursuits in
Sydney, filling for the whole of that
period the position of manager of
the Sun Insurance Office and being
prominently connected also with sev-
eral other commercial ventures in the
same interval, which terminated
with his death in 1911. He was
twice married, on the second
occasion to Emily Bethia, daughter
of the late Henry Steel Shaw, who
during his lifetime was official
assignee in Melbourne and a well-
known figure in financial circles and
one of the original members and
promoters of the “Melbourne Club. 1 ’
Of each union there was a family of
three sons and two daughters. The
sons of the second union became
identified with the pastoral industry
in Queensland. Of these the eldest
is Mr. JOHN MacDIARMID
ROYLE, who was born at
Randwick, New South Wales, on
August 11, 1887, and educated at
King’s College, Goulburn, on leaving
which school he entered the
University of Sydney. He com-
pleted his University course with
the degree of Bachelor of Engineer-
ing, and proceeded to Queensland,
where, as an officer of the State
Hydraulic Survey Department, he
became Inspector of Artesian Bores.
Seeing a larger return for his ener-
gies in independent enterprise he
occupied this position for a short
time only, relinquishing his connec-
tion with the Civil Service in order
to start as a boring contractor, a
capacity in which he was assisted by
his brothers, the late Raynes L. C.
and Mr. Paul E. Royle. The
Messrs. Boyle found ample scope for


successful effort in artesian boring
and continued to accept contracts
until the Empire’s need for men to
fight for national security and the
recognized ideals of the race during

the great struggle of 1914-18 caused
them to put aside all personal
considerations in view of the mighty
issues affecting their country’s

MR. J. MACD. ROYLE
and the late R. L. C. Royle were
accepted for active servicte and in
due course despatched to the
Western War theatre, where they
participated in various of the
NN
historic events which transpired in
France and Belgium, the former
continuing in the firing line until
the cessation of hostilities. On
receiving his discharge from the
army he resumed control of his
interests in Western Queensland,
which include a grazing area lying
in the Winton district that he had
selected some time previous to his
departure for the Old World, and
which since his return he has carried
on in conjunction with his brother,
Mr. P. E. Royle, at the same time
continuing in the business which the
firm has hitherto so successfully
conducted. Mr. J. MacD. Royle is
a member of the University and
Imperial Service Clubs, Sydney, and
of the Longreach and Winton Clubs.
He is a supporter of all local
movements of a progressive nature.
He married Edith Mary, second
daughter of Mr. W. P. Stephinson,
of Aincliffe, Sydney. The late
RAYNES LORD CHARLES
ROYLE pursued his scholastic
studies at King’s College, Goulburn,
from which school he entered the
Hawkesbury Agricultural College.
Subsequently he proceeded to
Queensland, where he joined his
eldest brother, with whom he
became engaged in the State service,
and later as a partner in artesian
bore-sinking operations, and whom
he finally accompanied to the Front.
Mr. R. L. C. Royle was attached
to the Royal Air Force and made
the great sacrifice at Menin on
November 8, 1918. At the time of
his death, which occurred accident-
ally in the course of his duties just
three days before the signing of the
Armistice, he was twenty-eight years
of age. The younger member of the
present firm, MR. PAUL E.
ROYLE, was born at Bowral, New
South Wales, on October 28, 1892,
and educated at the Church of
England Grammar School, North
Sydney. On completing his col-
legiate course he became employed
on the staff of the Sydney branch of
the Royal Insurance Company, in
whose service he remained three
years, gaining during that time a
good commercial training. In 1913
lie joined his brothers in Queensland
and with them took part in the
important phase of development
which has so materially advanced
the pastoral progress of the State,
continuing, after their departure
for the Front, to carry on the
connection which Mr. J. MacD.
Royle established in Western
Queensland. Mr. Paul E. Royle

Bowen and elsewhere. Mr. R. C.
Wharton received his early educa-
tion at the Armidale School, and
later was for many years a student
at King’s School, Parramatta,
which is famous as having been the
Alma Mater of many distinguished
Australians during its existence of
over ninety years. He con-
cluded his studies there when at the
age of eighteen, and in accordance
with his father’s wish joined the
staff of the Bank of New South Wales
at the head office of that institution
in Sydney, where he gained the com-
mercial knowledge which now forms
so essential a part of the equipment
for successful pastoral administra-
tion. In 1910, after a period of
nearly four years’ service with the
Here, for over a year, he familiarized
himself with the prevailing condi-
tions under which the industry was
conducted, severing his connection
with the property with the object of
gaining further experience before
finally embarking on pastoral enter-
prise on his own account. For
several months he studied the
methods of successfully conducting a
sheep property on “Kynuna,” a well-
known and important property situ-
ated near Winton, under the direc-
tion of the manager, Mr. L. G. Reid,
whose wide experience and knowledge
of sheep-raising and wool-growing
and other phases of pastoral work
were placed at his disposal. Before
launching out on his own account
he also spent a period on “Tarbrax,”
on May 25, 1888, and is the second
son of Mr. W. T Wharton, a well-
known pastoralist, who at time of
writing spends the greater portion of
his time in the South. Mr. Whar-

different parts of the Mother State.


The ALLINGHAM family was

had settled some years previously —
to the then “farthest north” of
Queensland. When the pastoral re-
sources, made known by the different
explorers who had traversed the vast
and unknown territory stretching to
the North, were first attracting capi-
tal and enterprise from the South,
the Allinghams were among the ear-
liest of the pioneers who trekked
northwards with stock. They set out
from New England with some thou-
sands of sheep in 1858, and, at the
end of a period verging on three
years, after surmounting the
obstacles and dangers peculiar to the
unknown territory through which
they had passed, arrived in the
Broadsound district. To enable the
reader to form some idea of the con-
ditions which they faced on this jour-
ney, it should be mentioned that it
was necessary for them to be con-
stantly on guard against attacks from
the aborigines, and that their progress
was hampered by violent storms, tor-
rential rainfalls of the kind that in a
night have been frequently known to'
inundate the country for miles with a
swiftly rushing volume of water
trapping the unwary to a death from
miles from any kind of settlement.

their most difficult problems, and it

from Captain John Mackay’s account
of his journey of exploration which
resulted in the discovery of the
Pioneer watershed and the site of
the thriving and important town
which bears his name, may prove of
interest here. In describing his re-
turn journey and the passage over
the Broadsound Range in July 1860,
he writes as follows:—“Descent was
difficult, and daybreak found us at
the camp of Mr. John Allingham,
excellent pastures of the Burdekin
watershed. Here Mr. C. Allingham
took up “Hillgrove” in the family
interests, and the big part which the
family played in the making of the
State’s pastoral history began. “Hill-
grove” was worked by the late John
and Johnstone Allingham for a
period, but John eventually sold out
to Johnstone and took up “Water-
view,” another now historical area.
Mr. Johnstone Allingham was the
Government and cut up for closer
settlement purposes. John Ailing-
ham, who married a lady bearing the
same name, though no relationship
to him, left no children. The late
Johnstone Allingham married on
July 4, 1877, a Miss Markham,
daughter of George Markham, of
Cooma, New South Wales. This lady,
who now resides in Sydney, was the
first white woman to cross the great

country.” From the locality referred
to by the explorer the Allinghams
continued their journey northwards,
and in April of the year 1861,
Christopher, the cousin, became one
of the exploring party led by the
late Edward Cunningham from the
newly founded township of Bowen to
the unknown territory west and north
of the settlement. This party named
Mount Dalrymple, and crossed the
Leichhardt Range with considerable
difficulty, finally discovering the
owner also of “Kangaroo Hills” and
“Muralambeen,” in the Ingham dis-
trict and of “Stockton,” near Innis-
fail. He retained “Hillgrove” until
the time of his death. In the early
days, when looking for fresh pastoral
country, he achieved much in the
way of exploration, and on his many
expeditions frequently had as a com-
panion Mr. Owen Macauley.

STUD COWS FROM “MOOKI SPRINGS” AT "FLETCHER VALE.”
GENERAL VIEW OF “HILLGROVE” STATION, YARDS AND SHEDS.


On the conclusion of his scholastic
course he returned to “Muralam-
been and interested himself in the
stud herd of Devon cattle which his
lather had founded and worked so
successfully on that station, breed-
ing stock whose progeny have found
their way all over Northern Queens-
land, and had a most beneficial effect
on the herds of this part of the State.
Until 1907, apart from the period he
had spent at college, his time had
been divided between “Muralam-
been and Hillgrove. In the year
above mentioned he permanently
took up his residence on the latter
station and engaged in stock work
under his maternal uncle, Mr. Mark-
ham. Three years later, in 1910,
Mr. John S. S. M. Allingham took
ovet the management of the family
interests, and since then has con-
tinued to carry out the duties of this
position for the Estate from his
headquarters at “Hillgrove. " The
areas which now come under his
jurisdiction are “Hillgrove," “Kan-
garoo Hills," “Fletcher Vale," and
“Southwick," the two latter being
under the personal management of
his brother, Johnstone. Having no
prediliction for public life he has
devoted himself almost exclusively to
the industry which his father and
other members of the family so
notably advanced in the past in the
face of hardships but vaguely
visioned by city dwellers of the pre-
sent generation, to whom the bush
with its vast unpopulated spaces is
little more than a name. The “sport
of Kings" provides his chief iecrea-
tion, and on the turf his love of a
good horse, his excellent judgment
and his success in breeding equine
stock, are notably apparent. For
many years his colours have been well
to the fore at the principal race
meetings of the North, being fre-
quently borne to victory by horses
that on occasion have established
records in the Northern racing world.
In the year 1914, he married Helen
Tornaline, eldest daughter of the late
Hr. William C. C. MacDonald, a
member of a family which, from a
period dating several generations
back, has contributed members to
various professional circles in Scot-
land, particularly those representa-
tive of the medical faculty. Of the
union there is a family of-two sons
and a daughter. JOHNSTONE
ALLINGHAM, “Fletcher Vale,"
the third son of the pioneer, was
born on August 9, 1886, and edu-
cated at King’s School, Parramatta,
the old-established academy which
has been the Alma Mater of so many
of our pastoralists since the date of
its foundation in the year 1832. On
concluding his studies, he returned to
"Muralambeen,” and thencefor-
ward devoted himself to pastoral
pursuits. In 1909, he removed to
"Hillgrove,” where much of his pre-
vious life had been spent, residing
there and taking part in the work of
administrate!! of the station for the
following five years. At the end of
tins period he removed to "Fletcher
Vale,” and, in the family interests,
took over the control of that station
and "Southwick,” an adjoining area.
He has since continued to carry on
the development of both these pro-
perties, making "Fletcher Vale” his
headquarters, Mr. Johnstone Alling-
ham, like his brother, is a keen
sportsman and prominent in local
racing circles. In the year 1914, he
married Violet, only daughter of Mr.
Adam Black, of "Pajingo” Station,
an Englishman and a well-known
pastoralist of the Charters Towers
district. Mr. Johnstone Allingham
has one son and a daughter. Both
daughters of the late Johnstone
Allingham are married, the elder,
Fanny, to Mr. Frank Armstrong, of
New Zealand, and the younger, Mae,
to Dr. Hough, of Sydney. The
latter, who resides at Warrawee, has
three sons and a daughter. "Hill-
grove,” "Kangaroo Flills,” "Flet-
cher Yale,” and "Southwick” cover
country aggregating in extent some
1,300 square miles. All these runs
have been considerably reduced in
area owing to resumptions by differ-
ent Governments, and formerly car-
ried cattle to the number of 50,000.
The strength of the combined herds
now depastured is 20,000, the reduc-
tion of stock being caused by decrease
of acreage, the severe drought of
1900-3, and the disastrous tick visi-
tation which preceded it. A cross

type favoured by the Allingham

used in keeping the herds up to the
desired standard has achieved equally
satisfactory results in the equine
department of the operations con-
ducted at “Hillgx-ove” and the other
properties, which, at time of writing,

of which 500 are grazed at “Hill-

Rivers, and a number of creeks. The
provision afforded by these sources
is amply supplemented by wells,
from which the water is made avail-
able to the stock by up-to-date wind-
mills. Portion of the old homestead
at “Hillgrove” has occupied its pre-
sent site since the days when sawn
slabs and shingles were the only
building materials available, the
original dwelling, which occupies the
centre of the accompanying picture,
having been erected in the early
seventies. From time to time addi-
tions were found necessary, and
these, with the original structure,

welcome which always awaits the
friends and acquaintances of its pre-
sent host and hostess is of the kind
which made the early bush homes of
Australia famous. “Fletcher Vale”
was acquired by the Messrs. Ailing-
ham in the year 1907. It adjoins
“Southwick,” and the two proper-
ties are most successfully used for
fattening stock bred on “Hillgrove.”
Both “Fletcher Vale” and “South-
wick” are endowed with excellent
natural water supplies, having each

“Roland Song’’ is the “Hillgrove’’
sire and “Flavone’’ is used on “Flet-

being chiefly carried on for the needs
of the station, though surplus horses
are marketed and quickly disposed
of. The cattle for the vaxdous runs
are practically all bred on “Hill-
grove,’’ which, by nature and
development, has been well adapted
for the purpose. Ridgy, sandy coun-
try well shaded with ironbark, blood-
wood and many other varieties of
timber indicate the character of the
“Hillgrove” country, which nature
has endowed with an excellent water
form an irregular mass of buildings,
each of which is reminiscent of differ-
ent stages in the growth of settlement
in Northern Queensland. This his-
toric old home lies 50 miles in a
northerly direction from Charters
Towers, and possesses those many
features of comfort which seem to
belong in a special manner to bush
dwellings of the kind, much of its
charm being contained in the
grounds, which, for picturesque
layout and the growth of fine old
trees, might well be the envy of the
owners of more modern residences.
The hospitality of “Hillgrove” in the
which is most pleasantly situated on
a bank of the Fletcher, a constantly
running stream which adds materi-
ally to the charm of the landscape,
has been considerably improved
since the advent of the Allinghams,
who have rendered the whole place
up-to-date and given much attention
to the cultivation of the grounds,
which are prettily laid out into lawns
and flower beds, and are gay with
beautiful shrubs and blooms, among
which are numerous varieties of loses.
As at “Hillgrove,” a very fine fern-
ery forms a feature of the “Fletcher
Yale” homestead surroundings.


ALBERT HENRY ABBOTT,
“Elma Grove,” Ingham, was born at
Grafton, New South Wales, on Aug-
ust 24, 1875, and is the elder of the
two sons of the late John Thomas and
MR. J. T. ABBOTT.
Margaret Jane Abbott (nee Finch),
who had, also, two daughters. His
maternal grandfather, the late Mr.
Finch, was a member of a New South
Wales family of the Maitland dis-
trict, and well known during his
lifetime for his pastoral enterprise
in the very early days of New South
Wales. Mr. John Neville Abbott,
his paternal grandfather, the founder
of the families now represented at
“Elma Grove,” in the Ingham dis-
trict and “Abbotsford,” near Stam-
ford, was a pioneer grazier and
agriculturist of New South Wales,
where others of the same line also
settled. He arrived from Ireland
with his wife and infant son and took
up land in the Hunter River district,
nearly a century ago, and there spent
many years. In New South Wales
the name became more prominent
both in pastoral and political circles,
one of the family of which he was a
member, Sir Joseph Abbott, having
been a speaker of the Legislative
Assembly of the then Colony. When
the North-east of Australia came
into prominence and settlement
rapidly progressed here, Mr. John
Neville Abbott sold hie Southern in-
terests and took up his residence in
Mackay, where his death finally
occurred, closing a life in which had
been experienced to the full the
vicissitudes that were the lot of those
who helped to make history in the
difficult days following the birth
of a Continent, which, in the
short space of 100 years, had pro-
gressed sufficiently to take its place
amongst the nations of the world. The
original pioneer Abbott will be re-
membered by many of a later gener-
ation than that to which he belonged,
as “Gentleman Abbott,” a sobriquet
by which he was well known. He
left a family of three sons and four
daughters. His sons played no small
part in connection with the pastoral
development of Northern Queens-
land, as the following outline of the
career of Mr. John Thomas Abbott,
one of the most expert horsemen of

his day, will show. Born in the
Dungog district of New South Wales,
Mr. J. T. Abbott acquired, while
still a lad at school, considerable
experience of stock and agricultural
pursuits, to which he seriously
applied himself when of an age to
discard his books and become his
father’s assistant on the Hunter
River property. Here he engaged in
mixed farming for some years, finally
becoming associated with the late Mr.
Mackie in the formation of various
pastoral runs in Queensland. Among
the historical properties with which
his name is identified is “Waverley,”
in the formation of which he assisted
away back in the sixties. He was also
associated for a time with the
mining industry, of which he had
considerable experience on various
goldfields, being one of the earliest
arrivals at the Culgoa diggings. In
the early seventies he joined his
brother, Mr. Henry Abbott, who
now lives in retirement at Hyde
Park, Townsville, on a road trip from
New South Wales to Northern
Queensland, with cattle and horses
for “Fanning River” and “Burdekin
Downs” Stations, a large percentage
of the stock being pedigreed and ex-
tremely valuable. This trip was fol-
lowed by others to the Burdekin dis-
trict, and, in Iris travels to and fro
between New South W ales and the
North, he was afforded many oppor-
tunities of widening his experience of
the geological conditions of his native
land, the knowledge thus acquired
later standing him in good stead in
his capacity of station manager and
as a factor in guiding his own landed
investments and their development.
His brother acquired an interest in
“Fanning River,” and was for many
years manager and owner of that
property, Mr. J. T. Abbott becoming
manager of “Burdekin Downs.”

ity which resulted from the railway

in the locality, next provided scope
for his energies. When the railway
was completed in the vicinity of
Reid River, Mr. Abbott removed to
Townsville, where he became the


proprietor of the Day Dawn Hotel,
which he continued to conduct until
Ingham sprang into vigorous life and
gave piomise oi becoming the centre
of a prospei ous district. Foreseeing
such a possibility, he sold his Towns-
ville interests in the early eighties
arid pui chased land in West Ingham,
where he became the owner of what
for some considerable time was the
only butchering business in the town.
While conducting his butchery he
erected and opened an hotel, which he
outlying the town with the pro-
gress of which he had been so closely
identified and with whose future
prosperity he was destined to be still
more notably associated. The present
“Elma Grove” was comprised in this
estate, which consisted of 800 acres
freehold and a considerable acreage
of leasehold, the whole being depas-
tured by the late gentleman with
valuable stock, both horned and
equine. For many years the holding
was solely devoted to stock, and
a small herd and a few horses,
the love of stock which Mr. A.
H. Abbott inherits from his
forbears being apparent in sev-
eral fine specimens of red polled
cattle and of equine blood stock and
light draughts. His success in breed-
ing is due to his wide experience in
this direction, for he has been more
or less associated with stock through-
out his life, when at an early age
having assisted his father in the late
gentleman’s operations as a station

called the Day Dawn, after the
business which he had previously
directed in Townsville. After
conducting for some years, the Day
Dawn, which, since its establishment,
has been eminently successful in
catering for the public and recog-
nized as the premier establishment of
its kind in Ingham, he disposed of
his interests in the town and retired
to New South Wales, where it was
his intention to permanently settle.
He changed his plans when afforded
an opportunity of purchasing a valu-
able block of country in the district
excellent cattle and horses were pro-
duced here. In the course of time,
Mr. Abbott and his elder son, who
had for long been associated with
him in partnership and management,
subdivided the freehold into small
areas for sugar-growing, and, dispos-
ing of these, retained only a quarter
of the original acreage. These sugar
farms, with the present “Elma
Grove,” now comprise one of the
richest areas connected with the
industry that has grown to such
importance. “Elma Grove,” though
chiefly devoted to cane, carries
manager, and later, in his indepen-
dent ventures as a pastoral land-
owner. He worked “Elina Grove”
in conjunction with the elder
gentleman until the year 1909, when
Mr. Abbott, Sen., retired from the
partnership, and Mr. Charles John
Burdekin Abbott of “Abbotsford,”
Stamford, became his partner. The
connection between the brothers
continued until the following year,
when, a dissolution being mutually
decided upon, Mr. C. J. B. Abbott
disposed of his interests to the gen-
tleman under review, sometime later


acquiring his present holding. Since
the year 1910, Mr. A. H. Abbott
has continued sole owner of what may
be termed one of the most desirable
properties of its kind in the Ingham
district, and one that possesses most
favourable conditions for sugar-grow-
ing, the average rainfall here being
registered as 70 inches per year. The
fertility of the land is evidenced in
the luxuriant growth and quality of
the cane, and by the wealth of nat-
ural vegetation displayed in tree and
plant life where it is allowed to
flourish. Distant about 10 miles, in
a direct line, from Ingham, the home-
stead was erected over thirty years
ago, at the time the property was
purchased by the father of the pres-
ent owner. It then ranked as the
finest home in the district, and is still
in a state of perfect preservation,
vying in convenience and comfort
with the most modern of its neigh-
bours. Occupying a site on a bank
of a permanent lagoon that is an
overflow of the Herbert River, shel-
tered by the elevation known as
Mount Leach, and surrounded by

shade trees, and at least twelve
varieties of fruit trees combine to
complete the beauty of an ideal
home; it commands a glorious panor-

of his property has not precluded
Mr. Abbott’s participation in affairs
of public interest, and throughout
his lengthy association with the dis-
trict as one of its prominent land-
owners, he has taken a share in all
movements tending to progress and
communal advancement. An original
guarantor for the formation of the
Herbert River Pastoral and Agricul-
tural Society, he has, ever since its
inception, lent his support to that
institution, while among other bodies
that receive his active support and
patronage is the Hawkins Creek
Farmers’ Association, of which he is
president. He whole-heartedly in-
terests himself in the national sport,
and, by his allegiance to the Herbert
River Jockey Club, of which he has
been a committeeman and steward for
a great number of years, and of
which his father was one of the
founders, has given considerable
impetus to affairs connected with the
turf in this district. His keen inter-
est in racing has been marked by a
few successes scored by his horses in
events of various meetings. His
usual recreation is motoring, which
makes possible easy and frequent
communication between the home-
stead and the township. In the year
1909, Mr. Abbott married Margaret
Ann Jane, eldest daughter of Mr. A.
J. Mad). Terry, now of “Inkerman”
Station, but at that time owner of
“Kirknie,” another historical prop-
erty, of which mention is made
elsewhere in this work. Of the union
there is a family of one son and one
daughter. The son, Henry Terry
Abbott, was born, on September 23,
1911, while the birthday of his sister,
Rose - Terry, is December 6, 1917.
Through Mr. Abbott’s marriage were
united two old pastoral families
whose names have continued to be
prominently associated with the
principal industry of the Con-
tinent from periods dating nearly
and over a century back, accord-
ing to the times their respect-
ive founders first set foot in their
adopted country. The career of
Mr. Terry of “Inkerman” has been
closely interwoven with the history
of Queensland. He represents the
third generation of the Terry family
in Australia, each of which has con-
tributed its members to the pastoral
development of the Continent.

The ALSTON BROTHERS,
proprietors of “Bronte” and “Black-
rock” in the vicinity of Ingham, and
part owners of “Stoneleigh” Station
near Ingham, on the Stone River,
ME. F. N. ALSTON .
are sons of Mr. Rowland Simpson
Alston and grandsons of the Rev. E.
C. Alston, who held a living of the
Church of England in Suffolk. Mr.
R. S. Alston was educated in Eng-
land at the famous Bradfield Col-
lege and came of a family which
ranks amongst the most ancient of
the Motherland, as many old records
show. According to Burke it may be
clearly traced back to the reign of
Edward I, when “William Alston of
Stisted in Essex for want of warranty
of Brookscraft in Stisted did grant
and confirm to John de Carpenter of
Naylinghurst so much of the better
land in Stisted except his mansion
house there.” A later record states
that “John Alston of Newton,
descended from William of Stisted,
was father of William Alston of
Newton, who was buried there in
1564, his wife being Elizabeth
Symonds, who died in the same
year.” In scanning the list of names
contained in the family tree of the
Alstons —which includes through
marriages many of the most aristo-
cratic of England—we read of one
Hugh Alston, who, in the reign of
the third Edward “wore for arms
Azure shield with ten stars dor
4. 3. 2. 1. long before coat armour
was granted by patent.” The famous
Lady Godiva, wife of Leofric, Earl
of Chester and Lord of Coventry, was
connected by marriage with the
Alstons of the 11th century. Dur-
ing recent generations, the family has
been largely represented in the pro-
fessional life of England. The head
of the branch established in Austra-
lia, Mr. R. S. Alston, settled to pas-
toral pursuits in Queensland in the
middle seventies, being then in his
late teens, and received the training
that, in the early days, was termed
“colonial experience,” at “Fanning
River” and “Burdekin Downs”
Stations. In the course of the duties
incidental to a jackaroo’s position he
visited the Herbert River district
with cattle for delivery, and there
saw the opportunity be awaited to
make a start on his own account. A
year later, he selected land in the
vicinity of Ingham which he named
LIEUT. R. E. ALSTON.
“Newton,” after an old property in
England which had been in the pos-
session of the family for over 300
years, and there carried on success-
fully as a pastoral landowner until
the desire of greater scope prompted
him to purchase a property known
as “Armidale” Station, which lay
between Townsville and Ingham.
Here he continued as a representa-
tive pastoralist, and one who took a
prominent and active part in the
public life of the district, until dis-
aster overtook him as a result of the
first appearance of the ruinous tick
pest, which, infecting cattle with a
fatal fever, rapidly decimated the
herds to which it found its way.
Being amongst those who, in the
space of a few months, saw the efforts
of many years brought to nought,
Mr. Alston was forced to abandon his
properties and seek other means of
livelihood. His previous career and
his lengthy term of experience as a
pastoralist secured for him the post
of Stock Inspector under the West
Australian Government, with which
he was associated in the same capa-
city for some time. When he finally
retired from active pursuits, he made
a permanent home in Ingham, where
he yet resides with his wife, to whom
he was there married in the year
1881. Mrs. Alston was a daughter
of the late Stephen Jones, who,
originally of Webley, Herefordshire,
made his advent to the land of the
Southern Cross in the year 1852 and
engaged in business in New South
Wales as a manufacturer of farming
implements. To the founder of the
Alston family in Australia were born
a family of six, of whom two sons
and a daughter survive. The latter,

gallantry was accorded recognition in
the shape of a medal inscribed with

received as an expression of the
appreciation of the King and
Empire. The Alston Bros., of
“Bronte,” “Blackrock” and “Stone-

FRANCIS ANDREW O’CON-
NOR CASSADY, J.P., “Mungalla,”
Ingham, Northern Queensland, was
born in Bowen on April 16, 1865,
and is the only child of the late
MR. J. CASSADY.
James Cassady, who was one of a
group of well-known pioneers who
first made history in the Burdekin
district, and a member of a family
that was notably identified with the
early settlement of Northern Queens-
land. Born at Port Glenone, County
Antrim, Ireland, on April 1, 1837,
the late gentleman was brought by
his parents to Australia when a
child, and with them, two brothers
and two sisters, landed in Sydney on
July 9, 1848. Proceeding to Bris-
bane, at that time the most
northerly settlement of the Contin-
ent, and, after a brief stay, thence to
the Burnett, where its founder took
up sheep country, the family for
many years continued to be identified
with the early development of the
pastoral industry in Southern
Queensland. Its founder, James
Cassady, Sen., considerably more
than ten years after his arrival in
the country, became a pioneer of the
district outlying the present town of
Ingham as the owner of "Wyan-
dotte,” a property situated near the
"Valley of Lagoons” Station and the
scene of his last years, for he died
there about 1862. Three years prev-
iously, as a young man of twenty-
one, James Cassady, after spending
ten years on the Burnett, left that
district for the Dawson, where he
added to his knowledge of pastoral
conditions until 1860. Leaving the
Dawson then, he trekked further
north with the object of securing
suitable grazing country, and to this
end started out from Rockhampton
early in 1861 with the party of gen-
tlemen who left that centre at the
same time as did the late G. E.
Dalrymple, his staff, and a detach-
ment of native police, for the pur-
pose of establishing the township of
Bowen. Mr. Cassady’s companions
on this trip were his brother, Mr.
Charles Cassady, Messrs. Cunning-
ham (who afterwards led an expedi-
tion from Bowen), Bode, Somer,
Powell, Allingham, Collings, Cavan-
agh, Curr and Hewitt. He left
Bowen for the unknown territory to

the west before Mr. Cunningham
and party started out, and was the
first white man to cross the Burdekin
River. The following extract from
his own account of the early settle
ment of the Kennedy district will be
of interest to many. After mention-
ing the circumstances recorded
above, he proceeds as follows:—“T.
Cavanagh was the first into the
Kennedy district with stock—a milk-
ing herd. He arrived at Port Denison
the same day as Dalrymple’s over-
land party got there. A few weeks
later Collings and MacDonald and
D. Emerson arrived with their
cattle. These were the first cattle to
arrive in the Kennedy and I was the
first white man to cross the Burdekin
River in the end of February, 1861.
At the same time I discovered the
Haughton River and named it after
Dick Haughton, who was in my
employ at the time. I took up the
country from the junction of the
Bogie River with the Burdekin
downwards for thirty miles and on
my way back was met by Messrs.
Myles, Stenhouse, Cunningham,
Somer and Ailing-ham going out in
the direction of the Burdekin, where
they got runs a few weeks later and
eventually stocked them.” The
country which the pioneer acquired
is included within the boundaries of
the area now known as "Inkerman.”
Finding it unsuitable for sheep, he
sold out to Mr. J. G. Macdonald,
and Townsville being yet unthought
of and the district holding out less
promise than in later years, he pro-
ceeded in search of good pastures as
far north and west as the Gulf coun-
try, where he was among the first
land prospectors, taking up consider-
able territory with a frontage of
eighty miles to the Leichhardt River.
Experiment proved the unsuitability
of this country, also, for sheep, and
Mr. Cassady abandoned it. His life
at this time was fraught with much
hardship, and was accompanied by
many tragic experiences owing to the
outbreak of Gulf fever, which ended
many a fine career at a time when
settlements were separated by even

accompanied him to the Gulf and was
among those who contracted the

died in Sydney in the year 1867,
leaving an only child, Francis
Andiew O Connor Cassady, the pres-
ent pioprietor of ‘ Mungalla.” In
the year 1862, after giving up his
Gulf property, Mr. James Cassady
proceeded to “Rosella Plains” in the
Cook district, which, earlier in the
same year, had been taken up by his
brother. His father’s death having
occurred at this time, other members
of the family removed to “Rosella
Plains, ’ in which Mr. James Cas-
sady retained an interest for the fol-
lowing ten years. This property was
sold in 1872, and in that year he took
up land on the Herbert River which
he afterwards sold to the C. S. R. Co.
early eighties, he inaugurated at
“Mungalla” the stud which has since
become so well known as having pro-
duced some of the finest blood horses
in the North. James Cassady
breathed his last in the “Mungalla”
homestead, and his final resting
place, a knoll shaded by a group of
beautiful white apple trees that swav
gently with the passing breezes as
though moved to do homage to a life
of manly effort and fine achievement,
is nearby, having been chosen by
himself. Mr. F. A. O’Connor
Cassady was born in Bowen on April
16, 1865, and educated at the Bris
bane Grammar School. As a boy,
and later, on reaching manhood, he
excelled in sport of every description,
nearly half a century ago. He has
furthered the developmental opera-
tions inaugurated by his father and
devoted considerable attention to
horse-breeding, in this respect fol-
lowing along the lines laid down by
the pioneer, with the result that the
“Mungalla” blood stock are well
known all over the North. Few men
have more actively participated in
public life than Mr. F. A. O’Connor
Cassady, who was created a Justice
of the Peace under the Philp Admin-
istration. For twelve years succes-
sively he was elected unopposed as a
member of the Hinchinbrook Shire
Council, and, during his association
with this body, under the old system,
was nine times chairman, having
In 1882, he took up the holding now
well known as “Mungalla,” where he
lesided for the following twenty
years, at the termination of which,
in 1902, his brave and useful career
was brought to a close. He com-
pleted a very elaborate scheme of
development on “Mungalla,” where
his work lives to mark the energy
which distinguished him and the
value of his enterprise to the dis-
trict. His knowledge of stock,
gained from early childhood
throughout a long and vigorous
career and under varying geological
and climatic conditions, was prob
ably unexcelled, and earned for him
recognition as one of the most

particularly in football, having
played in the Queensland eleven
against New South Wales in the
year 1884. He held the distinction
of being the best runner of the Bris-
bane Grammar School in his day. On
the conclusion of his college career, he
joined the staff of the Bank of New
South Wales, with which he was
associated for nine years and a half.
He resigned from the Bank’s ser-
vice at the end of that period, and,
under his father at “Mungalla,”
entered upon the career that now
absorbs his chief energies as owner of

Marie, daughter of Mr. Murdo Cam-
eron, a well-known citizen of
Townsville, a brief outline of whose
career is as follows:—Born in Ulla-
pool, Rosshire, Scotland, in 1844,
Mr. Cameron completed the voyage


from the Old World to Tasmania in
1859, being then a lad of fifteen.
After remaining in the Apple Isle
for a pei'iod, he crossed over to the
mainland, where, in the Gippsland
district, he became engaged in min-
ing. Here he followed the industry
at the various well-known gold
bearing centres of Gippsland, sub-
sequently proceeding to New South
Wales, where be was amongst the
earliest arrivals at Snowy River,
when gold was discovered there on
the site of Kiandra. After success-
ively wooing Fortune here, at Lamb-
ing Flat, the Lachlan and other
fields, he sailed for New Zealand,
where he became a pioneer of
Gabriel’s Gully, and later, at Hok-
itiki, on the west coast, there meet-
ing with changing fortune until the
discovery of the Gympie diggings led
him to return to Australia. He
spent a little time at Gympie, from
there travelling as far north as the
Gilbert River, whence he proceeded
to the Etheridge. The fields of this,
the Percy and the Robinson Rivers
saw him amongst the pioneer miners,
his career in the Far North ending
shortly after the opening up of
Charters Towers. At the time of his
arrival in the district, Charters
Towers had a population of only 300
souls. After a short period of in-
different luck with the pick and
shovel here, he opened a store at a
place called Brooks’ Camp, near the
Broughton River. With the news of
Mr. Mulligan’s discovery of payable
gold on the Palmer River, he sold
off his business to once more try his
luck in the Far North. As he neared
the completion of the overland jour-
ney to Mr. Mulligan’s camp on the
Palmer, he discovered gold at a point
of the river in the vicinity of the
original diggings. Shortly after-
wards he had some trouble here with
two notorious characters, who, with
loaded revolvers, endeavoured to
jump his claim. They had mistaken
their man in Mr. Cameron, however,
who overpowered both, flinging their
revolvers into the river. Since this
incident the spot has borne the
name of Revolver Point, and here
Mr. Cameron did fairly well. He
travelled to Cooktown over the
dreaded track known as Hell’s Gates
shortly after it was opened. From
Cooktown he started carrying with
pack horses, continuing to convey
necessaries from the port to the gold-
field for about four years, during
which his life was in frequent danger
from covert attacks by the abor-
igines, from a fever laden atmos-
phere, from hard fare and continual
exposure to inclement weather—con-
ditions which in the end combined
to undermine a constitution capable
of withstanding greater rigours than
would be possible to most men, and
finally caused him to relinquish
carrying and settle in Cooktown as
“mine host" of the Captain Cook
Hotel. He carried on in this bus-
iness for eighteen months, at the
end of which, in 1878, he disposed of
his Cooktown interests and proceeded
to Townsville and erected the Bridge

Hotel, the first establishment of its
kind at Ross Island, an environ of
the city. Thenceforward, until the
time of his death in June of the year
1917—a period spread over nearly
forty years—he continued to iden-
tify himself with the development of
the resources of Northern Queens-
land in various public capacities,
and in private life was soon to be
regarded as one of Townsville’s
successful men. He erected the
Crown Hotel and personally con-
ducted that business and acquired
considerable landed interests in the
town. In 1885, he was chosen as the
first representative of South Ward
in the Townsville Municipal Council.
He was a committeeman in every
department of municipal operations,
and of the local hospital, for which
he acted as vice-president. On three
separate occasions he was elected to
the Townsville Mayoral Chair, fill-
ing the office during the years 1894,
1901, and 1905. He has also acted
as Deputy Mayor. A popular park
of the city is named after him. The
late Murdo Cameron married Annie
O’Hara, a native of the North of
Ireland, by whom he had nine chil-
dren, there now being eight surviving.
Of his sons, three upheld the family
honour during the Great War. Mr.
Cassady has a family of three
daughters, Edna, Rua and Marie,
and a son, Alan, who was born on
January 22, 1917. Some details
connected with the “M ungall a”

MICHAEL BOLAND, J.P. :
Cairns, was born near Hacketts-
town, County Carlow, Ireland, on
July 21, 1863, and is the second son
MR. M. BOLAND .
of the late James Boland, an agricul-
turist of that County, where the
Boland family, which is of Celtic
origin, had been well and favourably
MR. J. K. BOLAND .
known for centuries. He was
educated at the National School at
Hackettstown, and there studied
until he was old enough to start life
as an employe in a Dublin estab-
lishment, where, being intended for
a commercial career, he applied his
mind to the mastery of as many
aspects of the enterprise of a big
business concern as possible during
the year or so his training lasted.
He continued thus to be employed in
the Irish metropolis until he had
gained a good .insight into first-
class business methods, but, being
ambitious of greater success than he
considered circumstance would vouch-
safe him in the Old World, he
decided to make the long voyage to
Australia and there carve a career
more fruitful of achievement than
would be possible at home. He
accordingly set out for the country
destined to become his by adoption,
and, on the natal day of the year
1881, first set foot in Melbourne.
From the great Victorian capital he
almost immediately proceeded to
New South Wales, where he re-
mained for about eight months. Dur-
ing that period he formed some idea
of the vastness of the country —a
matter upon which our kinsmen on
the other side have often somewhat
vague ideas—and of the diversity of
her resources, and became filled with
the desire of seeing something of the
possibilities of the young Colony of
Queensland. This desire he put into
effect by visiting Brisbane, after a
short period spent here proceeding as
far north as Cairns, where he arrived
early in the year 1882, thencefor-
ward applying himself to any work
that offered in the town or district
while awaiting an opportunity to
start a venture of the sort to which
he had served an apprenticeship in
the Old World. Meanwhile he
gained valuable experience of life
and the conditions under which
humanity progressed in the outposts
of Empire outlying the centres of
civilization in the North, and, like
so many new-comers struggling with-
out capital in unfamiliar surround-
ings devoted considerable energy to
mining, his activities in this direc-
tion being confined to tin-getting.
Much of his employment up to the
year 1887 was manual and of the
most strenuous order, and called for
considerable pluck and endurance
from one to whom real jjhysical
hardship was previously an unknown
quantity; but to his perception,
always of the keenest, the great
possibilities of the district were thus
made evident, and his mind evolved
from them a goal worth striving
for. He made his first bid for
MR. T. J. BOLAND .
independence in 1887, having then
established himself in a manner
proportionate to the trifling amount
of capital he had managed to
MR. W. P. BOLAND .
accumulate, and begun to attract
considerable custom by the force of a
personality that has largely counted
in every undertaking that has


marked his eminently successful
career. From his initial operations
in a little shop not one-fiftieth the
size of his present handsome premises,
sprang the important business so
well known throughout the North as
Bolands, Ltd., which, on the system
of the great emporium of Sydney
known as Anthony Horden’s,
embraces all necessary lines of com-
merce, its far-reaching operations
and the big financial problems
conditions such as those dwelling
within easier communication with the
world's markets, have the advantage,
Mr. Boland has for several years
past been importing direct from
European manufacturers, and has
everywhere possible eliminated from
his merchandise the burden neces-
sarily imposed when a middleman’s
services are required. The resulls
immediately shown were even more
gratifjdng than anticipated, and at
by the exceptional training which
their father v ? as able to afford them.
Mr. Boland has been more than a
pioneer of commerce, for to bis assist-
ance is due much of the prosperous
settlement established in the district
outlying Cairns and as far as the

in the trying days of pioneering
before production was at a stage to

being such as to necessitate in that
year its flotation into a limited con-
cern. The business is absolutely
controlled by Mr. Boland and his
three sons, by whom separate depart-
ments of the store are individually
managed. As an example of its
founder’s progressiveness it should
be mentioned that, long ago seeing
the necessity of supplying the people
of the Far North under financial
the present time strangers to Cairns
are surprised with the values obtain-
able at Bolands Ltd.—a fact
accounted for by Mr. Boland's
methods of buying and the elimina-
tion of overhead expenses. First-
class management, too, has had a
good deal to do with the success of
this firm, the ability which has
placed its head in the position which
he occupies to-day being evident also
in his sons, who have fully benefited
generously allowed, made it possible
to carry on until the worst of the
struggle, to which they must other-
wise have succumbed, was tided over.
His energy and foresight have led
him to interest himself in many
phases of industrial enterprise, not
the least important in the schedule
of his investments being such as are
embodied in mining, particularly in
connection with the historical Palmer
goldfield, to which, in conjunction


with his fellow-townsman, Mr. P.
d. Doyle, he has applied considerable
capital with the idea of ultimately
reviving prosperity in this part of the
Far North, there being little doubt
that the Palmer yet contains error-
mous possibilities for the investor.
His initiative and enterprise thus
applied to interests within the State
(embracing many successful ventures
outside his own district), have, as a
necessary sequence, largely aided her
regarded by him as of paramount
importance and claiming a large
share of his time and attention.
Municipal affairs occupied him as
far back as twenty years ago as an
alderman of the Cairns Council —
a capacity in which he acted for
some years. He is one of the
founders of the Cairns Harbour
Board, to establish which he spared
neither time nor energy, standing
strongly against vested interests
of a charitable nature find in him
a willing and generous supporter,
as does the ancient Church of
which he is a member and to which
his family has rendered unfaltering
adherence through the ages. Mr.
Boland has watched keenly the trend
of politics during the past forty
years, and in the early days, when
many abuses existed and the worker
laboured under conditions that un-
doubtedly called for reform, he

progress, and incidentally con-
tributcd to the great work of Empire
extension. He has not, however,
confined the application of his
knowledge to interests in Australia,
his keen familiarity with commerce
in its many forms suggesting several
profitable fields for enterprise.
Cairns itself has no more public-
spirited citizen than Mr. Michael
Boland, the welfare of the town,
district and community being
opposed to the scheme and keeping
alive flagging interest, until the
present body-one of the most suc-
cessful Harbour bodies in Australia
—became an established fact. His
efforts for the foundation of this
Board date back many years, and
after his determined energy had
combated the initial difficulties, and
those in favour of the body finally
secured its existence, he was ap-
pointed its Chairman. All movements
upheld the movement which was

Jersey, where he established a boys’
school which became highly reputed
in the scholastic world. Two sons
of this gentleman became Australians
by adoption, one, Mr. William
Heale, being prominent in Mel-
bourne shipping circles. The other,
the late George Bartlett Heale, the
father of the subject of this memoir,
was for some years an officer of the
Royal Navy, having resigned his
commission on the termination of a
voyage to Queensland in the H.M.S.
“Dasher” in order to join the staff
of the Bank of New South Wales.
He married a Miss Swanwick, only
daughter of the late William Swan-
wick, of Kyneton, Victoria. Mr.
E. W. Hesketh Heale is the only son
of the union, and may claim descent
from an old Devonshire family, of
naval and ecclesiastical fame, which
played a notable part in affairs in
the time of Cromwell, one of its
members having been prominently
connected with the Revolution.
Educated at the Kyneton Grammar
School and the Church of England
Grammar School, Melbourne, Mr.
Heale concluded his scholastic course
in 1889, when he entered the Vic-
torian Agricultural College at
Dookie. Here, by continued applica-
tion, he proved his appreciation of
the great pastoral potentialities of
his native land, and, ere completing
his training, obtained the Diploma
and Gold Medal of the College. The
same keenness which he displayed at
Dookie as a student obtained for him
in 1893 the position of agricultural
overseer at “Walbundrie” Station,
and later the management of that
fine property, which, during the time
of his connection with it, was owned
by the late Mr. Kiddle. The great
and varied resources of Queensland
could not fail to attract a man of
his temperament, and April, of the
year 1900, witnessed his advent to
the Far North of the State. At that
time the mining boom was at its
height here, and the copper mines
of Chillagoe and Garnett were in full
swing. Silver, tin, and lead were
also being produced in large quanti-
ties, and the whole of the North
was swayed by industrial activity
that was largely stimulated by the
enterprise and organizing ability of
the late John Moffat, who was one of
the most notable of those who
pioneered this part of Queensland.
The big impulse towards development
created at the time was shown in the
construction of the Chillagoe and
Garnett railway lines under the
direction of the late Messrs. A. S.
Frew and Wilcox, respectively, and
by long strings of camels, loaded
with copper, coke, and railway
materials, that continually passed
and re-passed between Lappa Junc-
tion and Garnett. Mr. Heale bore
letters from the South to Mr. Robert
Sturt, a well-known identity of

higher country with a view to settle-
ment, he went direct from Cairns to
1 olga (then Martin Town), and
being so impressed with the richness
of the volcanic scrubs of the elevated,


undulating tableland constituting
the Atherton district, decided here
to make his home. He has never re-
gretted his choice, for this country
is favoured with an average rainfall
of 60 inches annually, possesses a
magnificent climate, and is destined
to become some day the home of a
large and virile white population.
The Atherton Tableland is situated
south-west from the fine deep water
port of Cairns, with which it is con-
nected by rail. It may not be out of
place to mention here that Cairns
will shortly become the northern
terminal point of the Australian
railway system. This town, which
is fast attaining the size and import-
ance of a city, offers an excellent
market for products from the Table-
land, whereon both the cattle and
timber industries flourish and dairy-
ing and agriculture are firmly
established, maize being produced in
large quantities and the butter out-
put averaging a value of £120,000
per annum. Many farms are dotted
over the district in which the “Fleet-
wood” Estate is situated, and these
are well watered, 90 per cent, being
favoured with running streams. Its
chief centre is Malanda, a township
83 miles from Cairns by rail, and
the various holdings will have the
benefit of the main road system, now
under construction, which will run
from Cairns to Yungaburra, over the
mountains, past the Lakes to
Malanda, through Peeramon, and
thence to Kureen, the nearest rail-
way township to “Fleetwood,” and
lying within its boundaries. This fine
holding is beautifully situated about
twenty-two years since its owner
first centred bis interests on the
Tableland, and from the beginning
he has been closely identified with
the district’s development. Though
his chief interests are agriculture

and stock raising, he has continued
to be associated in a large way with
the timber industry, having over
twenty years ago imported a traction
engine and joined the firm of Morrow
Bros., which thereafter traded under
the title of Morrow Bros. & Heale.
Tire business, which handled large
quantities of cedar, was successful,
and in 1903 the first consignment of
sawn maple was sent South, being
various parts of the district and
holds the controlling interest in the
Tinaroo Timber Co. He was inter-
ested in the Cairns-Atherton Butter
Co., the first co-operative dairy com-
pany on the Tableland, in the forma-
tion of which he assisted. When this
company was forced into liquidation
by proprietary competition, he
assisted Mr. E. H. Styles, Mr. G.
Waller, and others in drafting the
articles of association of the present
Atherton Co-operative Butter Co.,
which has developed so satisfactorily.
He takes a keen interest in the bacon
factory now forming in the district,
and as a supplier he has been a con-
sistent supjrorter since its inception
some seventeen years ago of the co-
operative movement. At the present
time he is sending in the product of
four farms. Mr. Heale began his
public career as a member of the
Tinaroo Shire Council, in which he
represented Tolga. Subsequently,
when the Eacham Shire Council was
formed, he was elected one of the
first councillors, and since has held
the office of chairman on several
occasions. When the new franchise
came into force he was elected pre-
sident, a post he now holds. He
married the second daughter of the
late Anthony Linedale, who w T as a
member of the Cumberland family
in the Motherland, and a grandson
of Lord Rokeby. Others of his chil-
dren are the late Mrs. John Moffat,

with the mining development of
Northern Queensland; and Mr. John

he has established sawmills in

husband’s career in the Far North.
Of the union there is a family of one
eon and five daughters.

1852, and is a son of the late James
Gordon, a member of an old Irish

have transpired in the North from a

encourage hopes of advancement for
himself or future independence for
his children, ventured, in the year
1864, with his wife, six sons and sis
daughters, upon the long voyage to
the new country, little appreciating
the fact that its greatest need was for
men of his calibre. The family
accomplished the journey by the
sailing ship “Maryborough,” Mr.
Robert Gordon being at that time a
child not yet in his teens. The late
James Gordon on his arrival took up
country in the Bowen district, and
there settled to landed pursuits, with
the passing of time playing, as his
family later continued to do, an
important part in the development
of this portion of the Kennedy dis-
trict. However, in those early days,
it was a hard struggle for the pioneer
and his family, and even the lad of
twelve, the subject of our memoir,
relieved the strain on his parents’
resources by taking a post on a pas-
toral holding. This was at “St.
Ann’s,” a Suttor River property
and one of the original stations of
the Kennedy, and at that time in the
ownership of Messrs. Rook and
Munro. He spent nine years at “St.
Ann’s,” giving such proof of his
steadiness and fitness for responsi-
bility, that he was gradually pro-
moted until appointed to the man-
agement of the station. When at
about the age of twenty-one he

for a short time without meeting the
success he desired. There he fore-
gathered with some of those fine

period dating centuries back. James
Gordon, the founder in Australia of
the branch now represented at “Glen
Villa,” being well aware that such
opportunities as were open to him in
undertook a long overland trip with
cattle from “St. Ann’s” to “Dalgon-
ally” Station in the Gulf country,
where he continued to engage in
stock work for a year, during which
mates being one “Sam, the Tracker,’
who by this cognomen will be re-
membered by old-timers as one of the
best white trackers that the Contin-
ent has seen, though his name is lost


with that of many another who like-
wise played a part in settlement
under the hardest conditions “out-
back.” With this “Sam, the
Tracker,” one Bob Moxham and
two others, he left Thornborough to
force a way to Trinity Bay, as the
site of Cairns was then commonly
designated. When the party had
completed part of their journey, they
came upon a road blazed outwards
from Cairns by the late William
Smith, who had travelled to the port
from Cooktown by sea. Mr. Gordon
and his friends accordingly returned
to Thornborough, and shortly after-
wards, in 1876, again set out, this
time with the late Alec Woodward as
drover in charge of a mob of bullocks
destined to supply the wants of new
or intending settlers in and around
sold out to test the prospects of
Goldsborough, a centre lying sixteen
miles from Cairns, and at which
gold had been then recently dis-
covered. At this field he joined his
cousin, Mr. John Gordon, in a store-
keeping and butchering venture
which occupied him for about two
years, but where, on account of the
gold petering out, and the conse-
quent desertion of the township, he
and his partner experienced a severe
financial reverse. When the connec-
tion was dissolved, Mr. Robert Gor
don proceeded to the Tableland and
opened a store, a butcher’s shop and
an hotel at a place then called
Scrubby Creek, but now known as
Carrington. Meeting with better
fortune here, he soon had the busi-
ness on a solid financial footing, a
manager, and assisted in keeping the
business on the basis it enjoyed in
the district as the leading concern of
its kind during a period of twenty-
five years, at the termination of which
the death of Mr. W. J. Munro
occurred, and the remaining partners
mutually agreed to a dissolution.
Mr. Robert Gordon then went into
partial retirement from which for a
time he interested himself in dairy-
ing on a comparatively small scale.
Temperamentally reserved, he has
taken little part publicly in district
affairs, but has earned a name for
neighbourliness, good citizenship and
generosity to those less fortunately
placed than himself, and as one ever
ready to lend a helping hand when-
ever or wherever needed. The last

party enumerated above with the

From this time forward, however,
Cairns, instead of Cooktown, con-
tinued to be the port for the Hodg-
kinson. Later in the same year thau
he visited Cairns he rejoined his rel-
atives at Bowen, where he purchased
sixteen head of dairy cattle for ship-
ment to the new northern port. To
Mr. Gordon thus belongs the distinc-
tion of having shipped as well as
driven the first cattle to Cairns, and
being the first dairying landholder
there. From 1876 to 1879 his dairy-
ing interests claimed his whole
attention, but in the latter year he

consummation not long arrived at
before he sold out and purchased two
bullock teams, with which he oper-
ated as a carrier between Port Doug-
las and Herberton. After two years
of carrying, he disposed of his
plant and started a butchery at
Atherton which he personally con-
ducted for some years, finally selling
out and returning to the scene of one
of his former ventures, as "mine
host” of the Carrington Hotel. We
next find him established in business
as a member of the firm of Munro
and Gordon, station owners and
general butchers, with Messrs. Alex-
ander and W. J. Munro, and Mr.
John Gordon (his cousin and former
associate at Goldsborough) as
partners. On behalf of this firm he
supervised the stock department as

town of Cairns, he may, in the even-
ing of his life and in the companion-
ship of the good wife who for forty
years shared the ups and downs of
his career, ever helping him by her
cheerfulness and her practical sym-
pathy, look back on a past brimful of
incident and one that has had no
small bearing on the making of his-
tory in Northern Queensland. Mrs.
Gordon, to whom his marriage
occurred in the year 1884, is Eliza-
beth, daughter of the late Edward
Thomas Page. Mr. Page, hailing from
England, settled in Queensland over
half a century ago and became one
of the pioneers of Herberton. He
established and conducted bakeries
in the various of the early settle-
ments of the North.

has been closely identified with the
making of history in the Far North
since the eighties. Of English stock,
and the third son of the late Henry
which the family held stakes in the
County as farming landowners.
From that distant epoch in history
when the Empire began to absorb in
its own and other hemispheres, terri-
tory far removed from its base, the
Hardings have played a worthy part
in connection with the colonization
of its possessions, and the early
eighties found the subject of our
memoir thus representing the line in
Queensland. On the completion of
his education at a well-known public
school in Dorset, Mr. Harding, at the
age of sixteen, became engaged in
practical farming on his father’s
property in that County. Here he
had many opportunities of perfect-
ing himself in horsemanship, a pas-
time which had been his chief pleas-
ure from childhood, and before the
completion of his twentieth year he
had become known as an amateur
rider at Sandown Park and other
noted English courses. Later he dis-
tinguished himself as a member of
the Bibury Club and of the Castle
Club, Isle of Wight, as testified by
sporting annals of the time; and, as
a member of various hunt clubs, in
Dorsetshire and elsewhere, also
achieved laurels. When in his
middle twenties he put into effect a
long formed intention of seeing the

at Sydney, New South Wales, about

two years, at the end of which he
proceeded to the Far North, whose

he secured a post with the firm of
Brown Bros., who availed themselves
of his knowledge of equine stock by
placing him in charge of that branch
of their business which comprised the
potentialities at that time were be-
coming increasingly apparent to the
more enterprising Southerners of the
day. In due course he reached
Cooktown, where he held various


interests for a period; and later he
made himself au fait with the condi-
tions of still more recently settled
country by visiting Croydon, in the
Burke district, shortly after gold was
discovered on the site of the present
town. The year 1888 saw him accom-
plish the overland trip to Herberton,
where he was quick to realize that
excellent opportunities existed for
the turning of his knowledge of horse
lore to good account, and, as a first
step in this direction, he started a
livery stable in partnership with the
late Arthur Keeble. Horse-dealing
operations followed, and, while
devoting their energies towards the
establishment of a successful connec-
tion in the town and district, the
means comprised his whole interests
during the lengthy period he has
identified himself with the history of
the progress of the Tableland, for he
was prominently associated with the
flotation of several successful mining
companies at the period when the tin-
fields were in the zenith of their
prosperity. He has, also, for long
taken a hand in the pastoral develop-
ment of the district, his interests in
this direction embracing several
selections and a property known as
"Glen Harding,” which is used for
grazing and as a run for his horses,
and is sitnated in the vicinity of Her
berton. So closely has his career
during the past thirty-four years
been bound up with the things that

ton he successively filled the offices of
president of the Pastoral, Agricul-
tural and Industrial Associations,
and in both towns in turn he has
played an energetic part in connec-
tion with the organization and suc-
cess of the annual exhibitions, being
one of the founders of the institution
known as the Atherton Show. In-
affairs of sport he has always taken
a leading part, his predilection, as a
lover of horses and an expert in
knowledge concerning them, natur-
ally being for clean racing. Mr.
Harding married in the year 1898,

partners started a pack-horse service
between Cairns and Herberton for
the conveyance of goods over the
ranges to the latter centre, to which
the railway was not constructed until
many years later. From the outset
of his career in the Tableland, Mr.
Harding included among his inter-
ests a general stock and agency bus-
iness, which gradually assumed
important proportions, necessitating
the opening up of a branch in Ather-
ton, where the head office now is and
whence, the connection still widen-
ing, branches were established in
Malanda and Millaa Millaa. The
businesses hitherto mentioned by no
count in a district’s progress that
there is probably no better known
man on the Tableland than Mr.
Harding. He has held the Commis-
sion of the Peace since the time of
the Philp Administration, at whose
hands he received it. All movements
of a charitable or patriotic nature,
or otherwise tending to the well-being
of the community, have always
received his co-operation and sup-
port. In Herberton he participated
in local government as chairman of
the Divisional Board before that
body was superseded by the present
Shire Council, and held municipal
honours as councillor and mayor of
and Isobel, who, as a result of his
training, thoroughly skilled in horse
management and conversant with
the points by which a mount should
be judged, have all been frequent
winners of laurels in riding events in
the show ring and as the owners of
champion hacks. Mrs. Harding’s
father, the late Michael Dillon, was
one of the early arrivals at Cairns
after the establishment of that centre
as a township, and a pioneer of
other parts of the Mulgrave district,
throughout which his name is well
remembered for the part he played
in settlement, and for his fine attri-
butes as a citizen.


WILLIAM MARNANE, J.P.,
“Coombra,” Atherton, Northern
Queensland, is the eldest son of the
late William Marnane, a native of
Tipperary, and a descendant of a
MR. W. MARNANE.
South of Ireland family of very
ancient origin, his forbears of
many successive generations having
followed agricultural pursuits. Wil-
liam Marnane, the founder of the
Australian branch of the line, left
the Old W r orld and bought land at
Morpeth, New South Wales, in the
middle thirties, and here, as one of
the earliest free settlers, established
himself in commerce, becoming the
owner also of farming lands in the
district, in which he resided until
the time of his death. The present
head of the family, Mr. William
Marnane, of “Coombra,” was born
at Morpeth in the year 1848, and
there primarily educated. He re-
ceived a secondary course at an
academy in West Maitland under
the supervision of Mr. Foley, a well-
known educationist of bis day and
one who was distinguished for his
courtesy, integrity, and forbear-
ance, attributes which he did not
faii to instil into his pupils. When
in his middle teens he concluded his
school career and entered upon the
study of agriculture at one of his
father’s farms. Desiring, however,
to make a start in the pastoral in-
dustry, he later secured a post as
jackaroo on “Liverpool Plains,” one
of the best-known pastoral runs of
New South Wales. Here his keen
interest in his work resulted in the
acquisition of considerable know-
ledge relating to stock and their
management, but was not proof
against the fascination which the
gold diggings held for most enter-
prising young men of his day, as
was exemplified shortly after the
discovery of the Gulgong field, when
he ventured his luck as a votary of
Dame Fortune. At Gulgong his
efforts only yielded disappointment,
so he joined the rush to Parkes
when gold was there discovered. At
this centre he was among the suc-
cessful, and by the exercise of thrift
during five years of surface work
managed to accumulate sufficient
capital for the purchase of, approxi-
mately, 100 horses. On collecting
the desired number he abandoned

mining and overlanded with his
purchases to Brisbane, taking them
thence by boat to Cocktown, which
at the time was a thriving centre
and the jjort for the Palmer gold-
field. Success rewarding his initia-
tive as a horse dealer, he continued
to follow this phase of industry,
making his purchases in Sydney and
sales in the Far Northern town, and,
in the course of his operations, many
long sea trips between the North
and South. After Cairns found a
place on the map, he established a
connection there also, and organized
a pack service between the port and
the Hodgkinson goldfield. He dealt,
too, in mules, being the first to
introduce this class of stock to the
Queensland market. Immediately
after the first tin mine began to
yield its riches on the Tableland, he
speculated in what at the time was
regarded a doubtful venture, pur-
chasing the first two tons of tin
raised on the field. The transaction
turned out a profitable one, and he
invested the assets that resulted
from it in the purchase of another
consignment of the metal, having
previously made a study of the in-
dustry, with which he thence-
forward for a considerable time was
closely associated, for many years
as the “largest” individual buyer of
the Lancewood and Kangaroo Hills
tin mines. From Kangaroo Hills
the tin was brought by pack horse
to Ingham, whence it was conveyed
in flatties down the Herbert to
Dungeness, and thence shipped to
Sydney. It is impossible to convey
in an article of this character a true
conception of the difficulties and
extreme hardships involved in his
calling, which usually absorbed
about sixteen hours of his day and
w T as carried out in all weathers. The
tracks along which he often travelled
with his pack horses lay over moun-
tainous and boulder-strewn country,
and in many places were scarcely
discernible from the surrounding
bush. There were at times swollen
creeks or rivers to be crossed, and,
in such cases, a current stronger

mean the loss of life. In the moun-

pack from the narrow track down
the steep side of a range. In the
year 1888 he settled to less arduous
pursuits, having acquired in that
part of Queensland over which he
had so widely travelled the third
selection taken up on the Tableland.
Few have achieved more of a
generally cultivated panicum grass,
and, as a grazier, applied his early
acquired knowledge to the various
phases of the stock industry, includ-
ing dairying, for which he imported
the first pure-bred milking strains
which the Atherton district re-
ceived. He thus contributed to the
improvement of the Tableland herds,
and, as the importer of good draught
horses, to its equine stock. His pre-
sent herd is made up of the descend-
ants of highly-pedigreed sires and
dams. Mr. Marnane is rightly
reputed a man of strong personality
and unswerving integrity, and as
among the most active of the Table-
land community in forwarding its
interests. For the past twelve years
he has had the honour of being
chairman of the Tinaroo Shire
Council, of which he has been a
member for about fifteen years, and
for over a decade he has been a
member of the Cairns Harbour
Board. He is an energetic worker
also on behalf of charity, stronglv
supporting the institutions estab-
lished to that end. In the year 1893
he married Bessie, daughter of the
late Alexander McLuckie, an
Irishman and a scion of an old
County Kilkenny family. Mrs.

and mother are of the kind which

JOHN MICHAEL JOHNSTON,
Mt. Molloy, via Cairns, Northern
Queensland, is a. son of the late
Angus Johnston, who, a native of
Belfast, Ireland, engaged, from his
headquarters at Reykjavik, Iceland,
in the fishing export business. Born
in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland,
on December 29, 1884, and there
pursuing his education until reaching
the age of eleven, he concluded his
schooldays to enter upon a career
which for the following ten years
was spent chiefly at sea, with inter-
vals ashore when he engaged in the
saw-milling trade in Northern
Russia, Finland, Sweden, Canada
and New Zealand, his wanderings as
a seaman, followed by his landed
avocations, affording him opportuni-
ties of which, being a man of trained
observational powers he made the
fullest use, acquainting himself with
the customs, manners, industries and
arts of many nations. His peregrin-
ations eventually brought him to
Northern Queensland, where he
arrived from New Zealand in the
year 1906, having some years pre-
viously visited South Australia. In
New Zealand, after engaging in saw-
milling for a period, he devoted some
time to mining, and after his arrival
in Northern Queensland, followed the
same industry, prospecting all over
the Cape York Peninsula until finally

retained until a similar position was
open to him under the firm of Martin

ation of the possibilities of the timber

a site ideally suited from geological
and botanical point of view for his
purpose, he purchased an old mill
from the Mount Molloy Mining Co..
Ltd. then in liquidation and
from this foundation built up, within
a few years, the fine business of
which he is the head to-day as the
largest individual private mill owner
in Northern Queensland. In the
year 1921 the vastness of his opera-
tions, which extend to the various
States of the Commonwealth, neces-
sitated the erection of an establish-
ment nearer the coast, the site chosen
being Strathford, about four and a
half miles from Cairns. A modern
American Band Mill, past which
runs the Barron River, is nearing
completion here, and the owner pro-
poses to make it in time one of the
most up-to-date mills in the Com-
monwealth. The application in
Queensland of his wide experience of
old world methods of mill operation
has contributed in no small degree to
the industrial progress of the State
whose greatest need is enterprise and
energy of the sort which are the
possession of men of his calibre.
Reading and study afford his princi-
pal recreation, and he is thus con-
versant with the subject matter of
many works on .science and philo-
sophy. In the year 1909, he
married Annie Jane, daughter of

and after a voyage of nearly five
months’ duration, arrived in Austra-

of “Dunmore Park,” Atherton,
Northern Queensland, whose
achievements as a settler and
whose close association with the
making of history in the Far North
during the past half-century, are
described in detail in the following
memoir. Mr. Purcell was horn at
Moathill, in the parish of Muckalee,
County Kilkenny, Ireland, on
January 2, 1856, and thus was a
youth of eighteen when he landed in
Rockhampton. Like the great major-
ity of Irish families whose ancestries
date back to a period preceding the
Elizabethan settlements, the Pur-
cells of various generations fought
for the preservation of national
independence in the different epochs
which have marked the history of
their country since its conquest in
the sixteenth century, and suffered
keenly for their religious convic-
tions. Coming down to compara-
tively recent times which saw the
eviction of many Irish tenants from
their homes and farm lands, we find
the paternal and maternal grand-
fathers of the gentleman under
review settling in America, where
they, as well as his uncles, fought
with the North during the American
Civil War. The recollections of
these Irish Americans, who sought
to win without assets a home and
competence in a foreign country,
pp
went back to the days when the
education of children of Catholic
peasantry in Ireland was by law a
penal offence, and even in the child-
hood of Mr. Purcell, of “Dunmore
Park,” opportunities of study were
limited, as the country had not then
recovered from the long period dur-
ing which it had laboured under
oppression, famine, and political
distresses. He, however, received a
certain amount of tuition in a school
near his home, and after his advent
to Australia lost no opportunity of
adding to his store of knowledge. In
this country of vast resources he
determined to benefit by opportuni-
ties of making good such as would
have been denied him at home, and
to regard no honourable occupation

too strenuous or too exacting that
might bring him nearer the inde-
pendence at which he aimed. After
landing in Rockhampton he made
bushwards and secured employment
on a pastoral run as a fencer. This
work was followed by other occupa-
tions of a bush character, and within
a short time of his advent to the
country he was engaged by the con-
tractor in charge of the works to
assist in the early operations con-
nected with the construction of the
Rockhampton railway. He con-
tinued to be engaged in railway
work for a lengthy period, his
activities in the Rockhampton dis-
trict being followed by similar duties
in Townsville when railway con-
struction was first undertaken in the
Far North, and from Townsville he
was transferred in the same capacity
to Cairns. While in Cairns he
became cognizant of the fine timber
lands in that and the Atherton dis-
tricts, and in the year 1882, his
eighth in the country of his adop-
tion, began his career as a timber
getter. In this industry, in which
he prospered, he engaged for the fol-
lowing twenty-five years, and dur-
ing the whole of that arduous period,
spent largely in the forests of the
Cairns and Atherton districts, kept
in sight the goal of his ambition, to
its attainment (made possible by a
physique that has never suffered a
day’s illness since his advent to the
country forty-eight years ago) being
further spurred for the sakes of wife
and children. Industry and thrift,
practised from the outset of his
career in Queensland, had placed
him in the possession of sufficient
capital to purchase in the eighties
the 160-acre block of virgin country,
which, as the centre of much larger
possessions, still provides the site of
his home. Here his family was
reared, and in the year 1907, having
added to the original acreage by
purchase and selection, he discon-
tinued his activities in the timber
industry and devoted his energies
exclusively to farming. He was
ably assisted by his sons, and his

property soon became not only one
of the most productive on the Table-
land, but one of the district’s show
places, which, from time to time,
has afforded to gubernatorial or


other distinguished visitors, taken
thither by representative towns-
people, an insight into the wonderful
agricultural resources of this part
of Northern Queensland. The farm
extends into the Shires of Tinaroo
and Eacham. For many years it
yielded chiefly maize and dairying
products, and carried also a small
herd of beef cattle, but eventually
dairying was discontinued, and
corn, lucerne, and arrowroot were
added to its staple products. Other
tableland crops are grown, includ-
ing sugar-cane, which is cultivated
as fodder for stock. The “Dunmore
Park” dwelling-house, which is
comprised of two stories and con-
structed of cedar, stands within
picturesque grounds wherein the
giant fig and several varieties of
fruit and other well-grown shade
trees are conspicuous, and contains
the many comforts and conveniences
that combine to make a modern and
in every way desirable country home.
All the necessary outbuildings
that are the concomitants of an
the pioneer and his sons. Mr.
Purcell always depastures good stock
and has been frequently a successful
exhibitor at the annual shows held
in the district. He has periodically
imported from Sydney valuable
pedigreed Clydesdale stallions, his
enterprise in this respect having had
a most beneficial effect on the
through the channels of industry.
This conviction and the demands of
his calling, which in the past was
no sinecure, led him to consistently

Mrs. Purcell, whose death occurred
in the year 1916, and who as a
young bride of the early eighties
made a home in the Far North in
what was then a sparsely-settled and
lonely portion of Queensland. Here
she shared the trials, difficulties, and
sacrifices which thickly bestrewed
the path of her pioneer husband and
encouraged him to perseverance and
achievement in the pursuance of his
strenuous career as a timber getter,
in his efforts to get together the
stock and necessary implements for
hi& farm, and in the midst of heart-
breaking disappointments which so
often requited the most strenuous
efforts of the man on the land in the
early days of settlement. Here she
experienced many joys in the round
of duties comprised in the words
“wifehood” and “motherhood,” and
here, too, during the pioneer’s en-
forced absences with his teams, she
spent many lonely days—days
fraught with grave danger to the
lives of the mother and her children,
during which it was needful that she
should have a loaded revolver ever
ready at hand, and at night beneath
her pillow, lest a treacherous attack

races of the world. Of the men who

achieving and building for genera-
tions yet to come, few have lived to

Newell of Herberton may perceive

Countv Down, Ireland, on November
30, 1849. and educated at the
National School at HrumaghUs, be
is a son of Mr. Jarrms Newell, farmer
and a descendant of a family which.
well over a century ago, was recorded
as one of the oldest in County Down
and as having been engaged in
agricultural pursuits for centuries.
He left school immediately on enter-
ing his teens, when he was cent to a
commercial house in Belfast to learn
the grocery business. With this
house he was connected for seven
years, during which period he fre-
quently heard from an elder brother
who had settled in Australia and
whose accounts of the younger
country were sufficiently attractive to
create in the mind of the subject of
our memoir a keen desire to test for
himself its possibilities. This desire
he put in the way towards materiali-
zation in the year 1872, when, as a
passenger of the sailing ship "Gaunt-
let,” he concluded a voyage from
the Old World to Brisbane. In Bris-
bane he saw little opening for imme-
diate advancement of his trade,
and being still under the spell
of the “wanderlust,” he decided
to make straight for Stanthorpe
where, at the time, his brother was
engaged in tin-mining. On arrival
at Stanthorpe, he also identified him-
self with the industry, which occu-
pied him there for three years and
afforded him much of the experience
MR. W. G. NEWELL.
which stood him in good stead in
after life. In Stanthorpe he first
met his late partner, Mr. AVilliam
Jack, whom he joined in the eighties
in establishing the firm of Jack &
Newell, which has been so long and
favourably known throughout North-
ern Queensland. The outbreak of
the Hodgkinson diggings caused him
to embark for the then newly formed
township of Cooktown; and the year
1876 saw him among the pioneer
gold seekers on the river a few
months after its discovery by Mr.
James V. Mulligan. This was
before the foundation of Cairns and
when the settlement was yet a new
thing in the Cook district, Mr.
Newell having tramped from Cook-
town and shouldered his swag over
the rugged tracks which led to the
field. On arrival at the Hodgkinson
he became engaged in prospecting on
his own account, continuing to thus
employ his energies for some months.
Not finding metal in payable quan-
tities, he decided to abandon
mining and return to the South,
and, feeling decidedly richer in
experience than when he started
upon the adventurous career of a
gold seeker, he again applied himself
to trade, securing a post in a whole-
sale mercantile establishment in
Brisbane. Here his ability was soon
recognized, and he was chosen to
accompanv a member of the firm to
Smithfmld (Then a growing township
of which Cairns—destined later to
oTitgrow its neighbour—was the
port) to there open a branch of bis
employer’s Brisbane business. Of
this business he was left in charge,
and he continued to carry out the
duties incidental to this post until
something over a year later, when
his firm closed down. On being once
more thrown on his own resources,
he decided to try his luck at the
Palmer field, which had been pro-
claimed a diggings about three years
before, and at which he arrived in
the year 1877. Though he spent a
fair time prospecting in the locality
his efforts continued to be void of

results, and finally he made his way
to Tinaroo, a small alluvial tinfield.
where, in comradeship with the late
William Jack and two other friends
—John Bpown and Tom Brandon—


he met with slightly better, though
far from satisfactory, results, and
continued mining for tin for about
three years, having in the interim, in
1879, renewed acquaintance with the
late John Atherton, a pioneer
squatter and the owner of “Emerald
End” Station on the Barron River,
who informed him and his friend,
Mr. Jack, that he had found indica-
tions of the metal at a locality which
afterwards became the site of the
present town of Herberton and in the
vicinity of what is now the property
of the Great Northern Freehold Tin
Mining Co., Ltd. In November,
1879, after hearing Mr. Atherton’s
news, a small party was formed, and
under the leadership of Mr. Atherton
proceeded to the spot indicated.
Here the prospectors found speci-
mens which proved to be the first
lode tin discovered in Queensland,
but considered the show not
sufficiently good to warrant develop-
ment. They therefore broke up their
camp,which occupied, approximately,
the present site of the Herberton
Post Office, and,returned to Tinaroo,
where they resumed tin-getting, and
thus continued to employ themselves
until, in 1880, a report reached
them that tin had been found in
large quantities 100 miles from
immediately from Tinaroo and re-
newed their search in the neighbour-
hood of their former operations with
the result that they found lode tin
plentifully strewn on the surface in

rocks and boulders and in a water-
course called Prospectors’ Gully.
They worked up this Gully and, on
it to a tree. The party eventually
secured sixty acres as a freehold
claim, at the rate of thirty shillings
per acre, under the then existing
mining laws. Thus was Herberton
founded, its name originating as the
party—augmented by Mr. Atherton
and including one William Joss, to
whom Mr. Brown had sold his share
—rested one evening round their
camp-fire and discussed a suitable
designation for the embryo town.
After several suggestions had been
laid aside Herberton was chosen
upon Mr. Newell’s representations
that, being called from the Herbert
River, on which it is situated, and
after a man no longer living, and
who, it was unanimously agreed, had
achieved something for posterity, no
heartaches would be thereby caused.
To get the claim ratified at the
Warden’s Office at Thornborough,
Mr. Newell started through the bush
by what he deemed the shortest route
to the township, but made a hazard-
ous trip on account of the excessive
rainfall which the country exper-
ienced during the four days occupied
by his journey, being on three occa-
sions forced to swim the Walsh
River, then in full flood, and finally
to make a wide detour around its
head before reaching his destination,
Thornborough. The conviction being
borne upon them that this find was
on or near the spot indicated
by Mr. Atherton, Messrs. Jack,
Newell, Brown and Brandon started

May 20, 1880, came on to the fine
lode which they named the Great

Newell wrote the notice applying for
the prospecting claim and attached
where, in due course, he received a
satisfactory assay for his samples,
and the partners were officially
declared the owners of the claim.
These gentlemen, Messrs. Jack,


Newell, Brandon and Joss, took a

cess of the field was established a
large rush to Herbertou eventuated,
a population of several thousands
congregating from different parts of
the Continent, many of these early
cornel's proving to be of that indom-
itable class, who, playing their
part in the more stable settlement
which followed the decline of mining
in the North, built up a civilization
which is only to be compared with
the achievements of development
that stand for history in other parts
of this great laud. Mr. Newell’s in-
terest in the industry has never
waned, however, and, as local
director, he still guides the destinies

of the Great Northern Freehold Tin
Mine, the proprietary of which was
floated in a Company about twenty
years ago, when it received its pres-
ent title. Mr. Jack early sold his
share in the mine to a Mr. John
Moffat, receiving for it £5,000, and
set up a store in the new township.
Mr. Joss.also sold his share and to
the same'gentleman. Mr. Brandon’s
share on his death passed to Mr.
William McAdam Bonner. In 1882,
after having conducted his business
for a time solely on his own account,
Mr. Jack took Mr. Newell into part-
nership, a connection which contin-
ued until the death of the former
gentleman in the year 1909. The
firm thus formed carrying the title
of J ack & Newell, General Merchants
and Forwarding and Shipping
Agents, had, in those early days,
with a bark humpy as premises, a
turnover of about £3,000 a month.
With the passing of time, the part-
ners’ operations increased tremen-
dously, and, in the course of the
seventeen years following the estab-
lishment of the firm, branches were
extended from Herberton to Mar-
eeba, Irvinebank, Montalbion, Wat-
sonville, Muldiva, Mount Garnet,
Calcifer, Cairns and Port Douglas.
Four of these branches were later
closed down owing to the decline of
the mining settlements in which they
operated, but in Herberton, Mareeba,
Irvinebank, Mount Garnet, Cairns,
Port Douglas, Mossman, Mt. Molloy.
Mb. Mulligan and Chillagoe, the
business still flourishes as a limited
company concern under the sole con-
trol of Mr. Newell, whose sons and
other members of his family are
shareholders. Mr. Newell has
throughout his lengthy career in the
North given ample evidence of his
public-spiritedness, his activities in
this direction extending to parlia-
mentary business in 1896 when he
was returned by the electors as mem-
ber for Woothakata. He retained his
seat for the duration of two parlia-
ments and under four premiers, Sir
Hugh Nelson, the Hon. T. J. Byrne,
the Hon. J. R. Dickson and Sir
Robert Philp, whom each in turn he
strongly supported. Wearying of the
political arena in time, he declined
to re-contest the seat, and for
many years has devoted his leisure to
furthering the interests of the North
through the medium of different
public bodies and the channels of
commerce and industry. He still
continues to back up his belief in the
possibilities of the mining industry
in the Cook district by a considerable
outlay of capital; and for his large
ideas, his initiative and ability in
putting them into effect, has earned
a name throughout the State as the
most prominently progressive man in
the Hinterland. He was created a
Justice of the Peace in the year 1884.
Thirty-three years ago, when Her-
berton was a Municipality, he was
appointed its Mayor, and lor several
years he was Chairman of the Her-
berton Shire Council, having been
previously a member of the Tinaroo
Shire. From the date of its inception
until the year 1921 he continued a
member of the Cairns Harbour
Board, and in that capacity fully
earned the recognition so generously
accorded him on his retirement from
the body. He married on January
21, 1880, Janet, daughter of the late
William Jack, his former partner
and comrade, and of the union there
is a family of two sons and two
daughters, who were born at “Elders-
lie," which has been the family home
for the past forty years. Tne late
pioneer, William Jack, was a Ren-
irewshire man and born at Paisley
on December 31, 1833. Like Mr.
Newell, he qualified for a commercial
career, his last engagement in Scot-
land being as manager, for a large
co-operative company, of a store in
Paisley, the duties of which position
occupied him for three years and ter-
minated in 1865. On the 10th of
March of that year he embarked
from Plymouth in the sailing ship
“Lobelia ’ on what proved a sorrow-
ful journey, for ere its completion
after sixteen weeks of uninterrupted
sailing, his wife passed away, leaving
a new born infant which, shortly
after its arrival in Brisbane, death
claimed also. Mr. Jack quickly
adapted himself to conditions pre-
vailing in Queensland by taking such
work as offered, and finally made a
bid for fortune at the Gympie gold-
field, where he played his part in the
mining industry and was quick to
see the possibilities of trade in the
rapidly growing township. Opening
a store here in 1868, he carried on as
a retail merchant and butcher until
his enterprise and ability brought
him before the notice of Mr. John


Moffat, afterwards well known in
Northern Queensland, who offered
him the management of stores in
Brisbane. Two years later, having
carried out this work successfully, he
was sent to open a branch of the same
business at Stanthorpe, then in the
early days of its fame as a tin-bear-
ing centre. At Stanthorpe he justi-
fied the confidence of his employer
both as a tradesman and a buyer of
alluvial tin, and for four years re-
tained his position, which he relin-
quished so as to be free to make an
independent start at the Hodgkinson
goldfield, whence, not meeting with
the success he desired, he removed to
Tinaroo, where he prospected in com-
pany with Mr. Newell for three

and this example of his activity
affords a glimpse of the character of
the man, of the tireless energy which
effected here a prosperous settlement,
and his power to rise above and
adapt himself to circumstances, in-
stanced in the fact that for four
years he was separated by some
seventy miles from his white neigh-
bours. Mr. Jack in the course of his
lengthy career managed to see and
learn much of most parts of the
world. His grandchildren, Mr.
Newell’s two daughters, Janet Isabel
and Margaret are married, respect-
ively, to Mr. Norman Amos, engin-
eer in charge of the Queensland
Hunter River districts of the Mother
State. A son, John William, is the
issue of this union. The pioneer’s
younger son and namesake, John,
was born on August 5, 1893, and
educated at the Herberton State and
the Brisbane Grammar Schools. He
enlisted with the A.I.F. in October
1915, and left Australia for the
Western Theatre of the Great War
as an artillery sergeant. He soon
gained a lieutenancy and was trans-
ferred from the artillery to the
trench mortars, with which he con-
tinued to serve during the remainder
of the period occupied by the war,
returning to Australia with a Cap-
tain’s rank, won on the battlefield.
In despatches he received most

years. Mr. Jack’s early mining and
commercial ventures have been
already referred to; and as senior
partner of the business of Jack and
Newell he continued to be associated
with the present head of the firm
until his death. Further afield than
the Cook district his interests cov-
ered a wide range, and included a
goldfield in the Celebes, which he
visited in the early nineties on hear-
ing of its existence as a proposition
which had been worked to some
small extent by the natives, and
finally abandoned. Feeling confi-
dent on inspecting the old mine that
it warranted the expenditure, he
shortly had it on the market, and in
due course a company, with a cap-
ital of £125,000 and named
Central Railway line, and Mr. Viv-
ian Ilillcoat Allen, manager of the
business of Jack and Newell at Port
Douglas. Of the former union there
is a son and daughter, and of the
latter a daughter. Mr. Newell’s
eldest son, William Graham Newell
who was born on September 5, 1889,
and educated primarily at Her-
berton, is a past student of the Bris-
bane Grammar School. On the con-
clusion of his studies there he
returned to Herberton and entered
his father’s business, which has
occupied his energies ever since. On
August 21, 1916, he married Adeline

during his active career as one of the
ME. J. MOFFAT.
most prominent and universally es-
teemed of the men who furthered
settlement in the Far North of
Queensland. Born in Newmilns,
Ayrshire, Scotland, on May 26,
1841, and educated in Glasgow, he
left home in 1860, when at the age
of nineteen, in search of more
robust health than the climatic
rigors of his native land allowed
him. The early part of his life in
his adopted country was spent in the
southern portion of the State and
devoted to commercial pursuits, in
which he was associated with the
late Sir Robert Philp, and achieved
a considerable degree of success.
In 1860, he extended his interests
from Brisbane headquarters to Stan-
thorpe, where he opened a general
business of which he placed the late
William Jack —destined to precede
him to the North—in charge. In
Stanthorpe he dealt considerably in
alluvial tin, then being found in
large quantities on the field, and in
partnership with a Mr. Love, other-
wise interested himself in the tin-
mining industry. Bad times event-
ually overtook him in his Stanthorpe
ventures, and on the representations
of Mr. Newell and his friend and
old employe, Mr. Jack, he set out
for Northern Queensland with the
possibilities of tin-mining still in Ids
mind. Success rewarded his efforts
in the North, where, having joined
Messrs. Jack and Newell at the then
newly-proclaimed township of Her-
beiton, he purchased in the eighties
from the former gentleman and a
Mr. Joss, a half share in the Great
Northern Freehold Tin Mine, dis-
covered by Messrs. Jack and Newell
in 1880, when as a correlative event,
the town of Herberton was estab-
lished. The Great Northern Free-
hold jiroved a fine investment, and
other interests acquired by Mr.
Moffat, including the Irvinebank
Tin Mine, prospered, so that in time,
ieturning to Brisbane, and notifying
as many as possible of his own and
his former partner’s creditors, he
paid off the firm’s old debts with in-
terest, in which connection he distri-
buted an amount in the vicinity of
£50,000. For many years he was
personally identified with the pro-
gress and development of the town of
Irvinebank, and during the lengthy
period of his close association with
the building up of settlement in the
I ar North, he interested himself in
practically every mining venture
floated there, as well as in the indus-
try in other parts of the Continent
His expert knowledge of tin-mining
was notably apparent in his works
at Irvinebank, to which he welcomed
frequent visitors from various parts
of the world. A man of large ideas,
he spent vast sums in developmental
work, which included the making of
the fine dam at Irvinebank, the dam
in the hills at the back of the town,
and others in every mining proposi-
tion which he controlled. He was
endowed with the inventive faculty
which he successfully applied to his
various mining undertakings, and of
which the famous Moffat-Virtue
Shearing Machine is a result; and
was the financier of the well-known
company of Moffat, Virtue, Limited.
Unassuming in disposition, he re-
fused nomination for Parliament,
but having all the attributes of good
citizenship, notably assisted the pro-
gress of the country and frequently
placed the public before his personal
interests. His memory is revered in
the district in which he so long
resided, for his sterling qualities, his
readiness to lend a helping hand
whenever and wherever needed, and
the keen sense of justice and honour
which marked his actions. He lived
in Irvinebank until the year 1912,
when he moved with his family to
Cremorne, Sydney, which continued
to be his headquarters until the time
of his death in 1918 during a busi-
ness tour to Queensland. He mar-
ried in 1889, Margaret, daughter of
Mr. Charles Linedale, of Tenterfield,
New South Wales. Mrs. Moffat, who
survived her husband by a year, was
a grandniece of Archbishop Robin-
son, of Armagh, Ireland, a distin-
guished astronomer in his day. She
proved an able helpmeet to her hus-
band, and possessed a charm of per-
sonality that still lingers in the
memories of the many who experi-
enced the hospitality of the Moffat’s
beautiful home. To the pioneer
couple were born two daughters who
are now resident at St. Chad’s
House, Sydney.
Among the men who have risen
to affluence by sheer force of char-
acter and an apparently limitless
capacity for work, and whose
careers are interwoven with the
building up of settlement in North-
ern Queensland, few have achieved
greater prominence as pioneers of
commerce than did the late HENRY
SYDNEY WILLIAMS, an English-
man, who, born in 1844, hailed to
this country from Southamptonshire
in the early sixties. Though of farm-
ing stock—his forbears of many gen-
erations having engaged in primary
MR. H. S. WILLIAMS.
production—he was apprenticed, as
a lad in his native land, to a
saddler, whose guardianship proved
so little to his liking that he ran
away and seized the first opportunity


of sailing for Australia, in which
country, young as he was, he rea-
lized that better chances awaited
him than were ever likely to offer
at home. In the early years of his
MR. J. H . WILLIAMS.
life in his adopted country he en-
gaged in horse dealing. He was
actively associated with the mining
industry, also, and was one of the
early arrivals on the Palmer and
Hodgkinsou goldfields, where he
gained much experience of life under
hard, rough and exciting conditions.
Bowen knew him for a time in its
young days, and from here he made
his advent to Townsville, where he
made good use of the opportunities
for business enterprise in the young
and thriving town, establishing him-
self in Flinders Street in an auction-
eering and land agency business.
At his home in Flinders Street, his
six eldest children were born. While
engaged in Townsville, he acquired
important interests, landed and
otherwise, and for many years con-
tinued to reside there as one of the
prominent and influential citizens
of the district. However, ill for-
tune, acting chiefly through big
speculations, eventually faced him
with the necessity of making a fresh
start, which he effected near Bairns-
dale, in the Gippsland district of
Victoria with the purchase there of
farming lands. The conduct and
development of his Gippsland pro-
perty occupied his energies for five
years, at the end of which, owing
to severe illnesses contracted by Mrs.
Williams, whose constitution proved
unequal to local climatic conditions,
he disposed of his interests and sailed
with his family for the Far North
oi Queensland. This was in 1889,
and he proceeded from the coast to
Mount Garnet, in the vicinity of
which township his brother-in-law,
Mr. Edward Campbell, who now
lives in retirement in Atherton, was
engaged in pastoral pursuits at his
property, “Strathvale,” and in a
position to give him much valuable
information and advice in connec-
tion with the calling it was his in-
tention to follow. In the year 1890,
he took a lease of a farm in the
vicinity of Nyleta, a township in the
MR. H. S. WILLIAMS , JUN.
district outlying Atherton and at
that time known as Carrington. He
continued to work this farm, on
which the three youngest of his
family were born, for a period of
seven years, during which his most
strenuous efforts were rewarded with
a bare livelihood and he was con-
tinually faced with hardships the
nature of which it would be difficult
to convey a true conception in these
days of comparative luxury for
townsfolk and even those whose
efforts are devoted to production on
the land. In the eighties and nine-
ties the district, more than 100 miles
from Cairns due west, offered little
in the way of markets, and the un-
developed condition of trade caused
him to depend largely on his own
produce for supplying the necessaries
of life to his family. He manufac-
tured flour from Indian corn and the
bread made with this and bacon of
his own growing and curing, con-
stituted, with the occasional addition
of other farm products, their prin-
cipal food. Despite militant con-
ditions, however, he managed to
make headway, and about the year
1897, the development of the Table-
land having in the meantime con-
siderably expanded, saw an oppor-
tunity of starting what promised to
be a successful commercial venture
at a place called Scrubby Creek,
within a mile of his farm. Opening
a produce and general store here,
and a butchering business, his in-
itiative was almost immediately
rewarded with encouraging results
that were largely due to the co-
operation of his children, who proved
then, as now, what unity of action
and family devotedness may accom-
plish; and after a short interval
began that prosperity which was
destined to grow and have such an
important bearing on the future
industrial and landed development of
the district. Encouraged by the re-
sults which attended his last venture,
MR. A. S. WILLIAMS.
he next became the owner, by
purchase from Mr. Robert Gordon,
of the Carrier’s Arms Hotel, Car-
rington, which, owing to its con-
venient situation, he made the


headquarters from which he adminis-
tered his other interests, at the same
time personally conducting the estab-
lishment. Plaving once made a

Pocket (now Yungaburra). Alum-
bah Pocket, up till that time, had
received development only at the
hands of a few old pioneers who had
struggled on in circumstances similar
to those which marked the first seven
years of Mr. Williams’ sojourn in
the Far North; and his purchase was
regarded by his friends as anything
but a wise policy. But his ability
of seeing beyond the present, and
his conviction that with the advent
of the railway, which he foresaw
would at no distant date be built
to what he predicted would come to
be regarded as one of the most fertile
districts of the Continent, actuated
his enterprise. Time has verified
his wisdom and the district has jus-
tified his confidence, for Alumbah
Pocket, cut up and laid open to
selectors, became a thriving district,
and the railway which serves it, in
conjunction with the improvements
effected since he entered into its pos-
session, increased twenty-fold the
value of Mr. Williams’ property.
Sometime after the purchase of the
area, he erected and ran a store and
butchery on it for the benefit of those
already in occupation of the district;
and later secured a license and put
up the building then known as the
Alumbah Hotel. With the erection
of his store in this locality he laid
and acquired important pastoral in-
terests before death put an end to
his exertions at the age of sixty-four.
He took a deep interest in the locality

While at Carrington, he had pur-
chased by auction from the estate
of an old settler then recently
deceased, an area at Alumbah
the foundations of one of the most
important business connections on
the Tableland, having considerably
extended the scope of his operations
among the public positions which
he held being the honorary secre-
taryship and the presidentship of
the Carrington School Board, and


a membership of the local Divisional
Board. An interval of but four
years elapsed between the passing
of the pioneer and his good wife,
without further reference to whose
loyal comradeship, nobly expressed
motherhood and great-hearted neigh-
bourliness this memoir would be in-
complete. To her husband and
children during the trying years that
were spent in the vicinity of Ather-
ton, as in scenes of after life, she
proved an unfailing stay in every
circumstance of grief, trouble or
difficulty that presented itself, hav-
ing for all within her ken ready
advice and a practical sympathy that
shaped itself to the needs of those
about her, making her regard no
effort too difficult that might alle-
viate distress, pain or sickness when
such visitants made their appear-
ance in her own home or those of
her neighbours. All this in a locality
where medical aid there was none
and where she was frequently called
to the bedside of those who had great
need of her ministrations. Six sons
and four daughters survived her,
though a link in the family chain
was snapped in the year 1922, when,
by the death of Mr. Alfred Victor
Williams, the fifth son, was created
a gap in one of those successful
partnerships which command admir-
ation not only for their achieve-
ments in the commercial world but
for their representation of family
devotedness. Of the daughters, two
married, the eldest, Frances Amelia,
to Mr. Arthur Henry Wardle, whose
death occurred in October of the
year 1922 and who was well known
as the owner of large butchering in-
terests in Northern Queensland;
and the next in age, Marion Maud,
to Mr. John Joseph Kehoe who now
conducts the Lake Eaoham Hotel,
Yungaburra, on behalf of the Wil-
liams family. The two younger,
Beatrice Isabel and Irene Olive,
make their headquarters at Yuuga-
burra, though they spend much of
their time in travelling, having in
the course of thei last few years
visited America, Honolulu and many
places of interest in Australia.
JOHN HENRY WILLIAMS,

of the pioneer, was born in Towns-
ville on August 29, 1878, and

a member of the Herberton Shire
Council. He married Mary, widow
of the late John Allen, and has a
family of one son and three
daughters. HENRY SYDNEY
WILLIAMS, J.P., the second son
and namesake of the pioneer, was
born at Townsville, in September,
1881, and educated in that city.
He was appointed a member of the
first Shire Council of Eacham and
continued his connection with the
body for six years. Actively asso-
ciated with the expansion of the pas-
toral industry in the district and the
interests of the firm of which he is
a member, he is managing director
of the Eacham Pastoral Agencies
and a director of the Estate H. S.

at “Sydonia” Station. He married

town, Sydney; a daughter being the
issue of the union. Born at Towns-

CAMPBELL WILLIAMS is a
native of Townsville, the date of his
birth being October, 1885. Among
the bodies with which he has
associated himself for the welfare of
the district is the Tinaroo Shire
Council, of which he has been a mem-
ber since the year 1921. He married

McHugh, who for long was well
known as a piopeering identity
of Toowoomba district, but who,
for some time prior to his
death, was settled on the land
near Malanda. Mr. F. C. Williams
has a family of two sons and one
daughter. The fifth son of the

wards. until the time of his death,
controlling with marked success the
important branch at Malanda. By
his demise a strong link in the chain
of family co-operation has been
severed. EDWARD STEATTEN
WILLIAMS, J.P., was born at
Mount Garnet in August of the year
1892. He joined his brothers, Albert
Soffi and Frederick Campbell in the
office of a managing director of Estate
H. S. Williams Limited in 1916,
since when his time has been devoted
to the interests of the company and
much of his leisure to the further-
ance of communal affairs as a mem-
ber of the Eacham Shire Council
with which he has been associated
for over seven years and has held
the office of chairman for three
years. He and his brothers prom-
inently participated in repatriation
and other movements instituted
during the course of the Great
War. He married Claudia Zilla,
younger daughter of the late
Patrick McHugh, above referred
to as the father-in-law of his
brother, Mr. F. C. Williams. Of
this union there is a family of three
sons and one daughter. By refer-
ence to the foregoing allusions re the
activities of the founder of the family
and his sons, it will be realized that
the firm of Estate H. S. Williams
Limited has played a. big part
in connection with the development
and progress of the Tableland dis-
trict. Nothing has been said, how-

Northern Queensland, was born at

February 14, 1865, and is the eldest
MR. J. ATHERTON.
surviving son of the late John
Atherton and a grandson of Edmund
Atherton, a Lancashire gentleman
who was the founder of the various
branches of this family in Australia.
The last-mentioned pioneer made
his advent to the country in the year
1844 and settled in the Armidale
district of New South Wales,
whence, after a residence of sixteen
years, he removed with his family
from “Baldblair,” his southern
holding, to the then newly-created
Colony of Queensland. In 1860,
after an eventful overland journey,
he arrived in the Rockhampton dis-
trict, where he settled, establishing
“Mount Hedlow” Station. Three
years later, in 1863, his sojourn on
earth was brought to a close. He
was survived by six sons and three
daughters, who, with one exception,
were identified with the early pas-
toral development of Queensland,
and among the men who pioneered
the vast lonely spaces of the North,
the sons are remembered as having
been conspicuously active, though
none more notably so than Mr. John
Atherton, the father of the subject
of this memoir. This gentleman
accompanied the original pioneer
from Lancashire, hie birthplace, and
many years later, when settlement
was in its infancy on the Northern
Tableland and the town of Mareeba,
to which the station is adjacent, was
yet unthought of, became the
founder of “Emerald End,” now one
of the historical cattle holdings of the
State. The town of Atherton is
named after Mr. John Atherton,
whose family consisted of four sons
and four daughters, the former
being Edmund Henry (now
deceased), William, John Grainger,
and Ernest Albert Atherton. The
two latter are now engaged as pas-
toralists and wholesale butchers in
Cairns and its district. Of the
daughters, two, Mrs. Browne and
Miss Kate Atherton, yet reside at
the old home of “Emerald End,”
while one is the wife of Mr. E. M.
Harte, a member of a very old
MR. W. ATHERTON .
Brisbane family, and the last is Mrs.
A. Minchen, who married into a
family which was prominent in the
early pastoral life of the Southern
States. The late Edmund Henry
Atherton died in Forsayth, in the
Far North of Queensland, in the year-
-1919, leaving a widow and one son,
John Henry, now in his teens. His
brother next in age, Mr. William
Atherton, of “Chillagoe” Station,
was primarily educated under the
paternal rooftree, and later became
a student of a school in Bendigo,
Victoria, where he remained until
at the age of sixteen years. From
school he returned to “Emerald
End,” the station whose formation
he had witnessed seven years before,
when he accomplished with his
father the overland journey with
stock from “Mount Hedlow,” near
Rockhampton, to the tableland
beyond the mountains of Cairns.
Here he resumed his connection with
the industry with which he was so
familiar, and some time later struck
out for himself, thenceforward gain-
ing much experience of stock and
their management on various
Northern Queensland holdings. In
the year 1887 he joined his late
father and brother, Messrs. John
and Edmund Henry Atherton, in
the formation of “Chillagoe” Sta-
tion, which, though not foreseen by
him at the time, was destined to be
his headquarters throughout a long
and useful career. He purchased
his brother’s interest in the property
less than two years after its forma-
tion, and eleven years later, by
the purchase of Mr. John Atherton’s
share in 1899, became its sole owner.
“Chillagoe” embraces about 250
square miles of good cattle country
that surrounds the mining township
of Chillagoe, so named after Mr.
Atherton’s station, which received
its designation from Mr. John
Atherton. It carries an excellent
herd, which was built up from blood
shorthorns which the owner early
secured from the Messrs. Archers’
stud in the Rockhampton district.

children in New South Wales in the
year 1844. John Atherton was then
aged seven. His childhood and
youth were spent in the Mother
Colony, where his father took up
pastoral areas which he devoted to
the sheep industry, in connection
with which John engaged in shep-
herding and other avocations until
1857, when he set out for Queens-
land with his brother James, who
was taking sheep to the newly settled
country outlying the then infant
township of Rockhampton. Here he
arrived in February, 1858, and two
years later the whole family settled
in the vicinity of this now flourishing
city, “Mount Hedlow,” one of the
historical holdings of the State,
being founded by Edmund Atherton
in the locality. Mr. John Atherton
was associated with the early history
of the Rockhampton district until
1875, up to that date having engaged
in various occupations and spent
some years in grazing pursuits on his
own account at a place called
“Bamoyea.” He also travelled stock
to different parts of the erstwhile
Colony, and in 1873, the year in
which Mr. Mulligan discovered pay-
able gold on the Palmer River,
undertook a droving trip in the
direction of the far northern field,
his chargee being cattle, which, how-
ever, he disposed of en route. Sub-
sequently, having formed a favour-
able opinion of the country through
which he had passed, he decided to
settle in the Cook district, and in the
middle seventies, accompanied by his
two sons, then lads of eleven and
thirteen years, started upon the
overland journey to the country now
known as “Cashmere” Station, tak-
ing with him 1,500 head of cattle,
about ninety horses, two bullock
drays, and a buggy. Early in
January, 1875, he came on to the
Burdekin by way of the Sea View
Range, and thence proceeded to his
destination. After several months
occupied in the formation of “Cash-
mere,” he proceeded to Townsville
to meet his wife and children, who,
pending the completion of his
arrangements, had resided in North
Rockhampton. Mrs. Atherton and
her family, who had travelled by
boat to Townsville, were unable to
continue the journey to “Cashmere”
owing to an illness contracted by one
of the children the day following
their arrival. Her husband having
therefore returned to the station,
made a second visit to Townsville
some weeks later for the purpose of
taking them to their new home. On
this occasion a start was made, but
considerable delay occurred en route
owing to the wet season, which
necessitated a month’s camp on the
top of Sea View Range. When the
rains had subsided and the country
was once more fit for travelling, the
party pushed on to “Cashmere,”
where they had been settled but a few

months, however, when preparations
were made for another move, Mr.
Atherton having in that time sold
his right to the country to Mr.
McDowall (late of “Christmas
MR. E. A. ATHERTON.
Cieek, Rangaroo Hills,” and
other stations) owing to the distance
of the area from the Palmer gold-
fields, then the only available market
for his stock. Trekking still further


north, he eventually came to the
Barron River district, where, in
1877, he took up the virgin country
since known as “Emerald End,” to
which, having lost no time in erect-
ing the homestead, he shortly
MR. H. M. SVENDSEN .
brought his wife and family. He
stocked “Emerald End” from “Cash-
mere” with cattle to the number of
1,600 head, but the herd was not
permitted bo increase normally owing
to the continual depredations of the
blacks, the loss of stock at their
hands being estimated at the rate of
one bullock a day during the first
five years of his sojourn in the dis-
trict. The blacks of this locality were
a very real menace to the lives of
the settlers, as the pioneer had grim
experience, carrying to the day of
his death an inch-long wound in the
side of his head which had been
inflicted by a stone tomahawk
treacherously aimed by a dusky foe.
Horses, too, were wantonly destroyed,
his daughters remembering an occa-
sion when two of them accompanied
him on the return journey from
Cairns to the station, and, having
put up at a wayside inn, learned the
following morning that the blacks
had led a quiet pony miles into the
scrub and killed her. Mr. Atherton
was the discoverer of tin on the table-
land, Tinaroo Creek diggings being
established as a result. Later,
casually prospecting, he found the
same metal on the site of the present
town of Herberton. In partnership
with Messrs. McCord and Robson,
qq2
he held on Tinaroo Creek a mineral
homestead block of 210 acres at a
rental of ss. per acre per annum,
but his inexperience of the industry
and the pressing nature of his pas-
toral interests prevented him from
profitably working this property.
He conducted Mr. Willie Jack and
Mr. John Newell to his later find,
and these two gentlemen, prospect-
ing from the point he indicated,
discovered within a week the lode
which was afterwards to become so
well known as the Great Northern
Tin Mine. Mr. Atherton’s pioneer-
ing work in the district dates beyond
the foundation of Cairns, which he
visited in 1877, when the then town-
ship, established during the previous
year, was denoted by a few tents
only. The town of Atherton was
named after him, and possibly none
of the pioneers of that district were
more closely identified with the pro-
gression of Northern Queensland.
He formed and named “Emerald
End,” “Chillagoe,” and “Nychum”
Stations, and other places in the
district, and was prominently asso-
ciated with various public bodies
instituted for its advancement,
among them being the Mareeba
District Mining, Pastoral, Agricul-
tural, and Industrial Association, of
which he was patron. He married
in 1862 Catherine, eldest daughter
of Captain Grainger, who was for
many years Superintendent of Police
in Belfast, Ireland, Mrs. Atherton,
who passed away in the year 1902,
having been a native of County
Cavan. Mr. Atherton died in the
year 1913, and was survived by four
sons and four daughters, a fifth
daughter having died in infancy.
Of the sons, the eldest was Edmund
Henry, who was born on August 14,
1863, and died of influenza on
August 22, 1919. He married on
July 21, 1904, Margaret Leahy, and
is survived by one son, John Henry,
who is now sixteen years of age.

JOHN GRAINGER ATHERTON
was born in Rockhampton on Octo-
ber 6, 1875, and educated primarily
by private tuition at “Emerald
End,” attending the Townsville
Grammar School for a secondary


course and studying there until
reaching the age of eighteen, when
he returned to the old home. Very
shortly he proceeded to "Nychum,”
a Mitchell River property then
owned by his father, and here he
gained excellent experience of all
phases of stock work, eventually

entering upon the management of
the run. Nearly a quarter of a
century ago, when the Chillagoe-
Mungana railway line was under
construction, he took charge of a
butchering establishment in the
latter centre, at which he resided
until the year 1907, when he pur-
chased from Mr. Ernest Garbutt a
butchery in Gurrumbah. After a
brief period he sold out of this con-
cern, and thenceforward for some
time was engaged in a variety of
occupations, eventually agairi estab-
lishing himself in the butchering
trade in Mungana and running a
branch of his business in 0.K., now
a dead settlement, but at that time
an important copper-mining centre.
In the year 1915 he joined his
brother, Mr. E. A. Atherton, in the
purchase of the butchering business
of the estate of the late W. J.
Munro. This they jointly conducted
as a wholesale and retail proposition
until the year 1922, when they con-
fined their activities to wholesale
butchering solely. Mr. J. G. Ather-
ton takes his place in all movements
that count for the betterment of the
district or community. In his school
days he excelled in athletics, and
since his advent to Cairns he has
consistently encouraged various forms
of clean sport. He married in the
vear 1908 Olive, daughter of Mr.
Louis Carman, of Herberton, who, a
native of Orange, New South Wales,
is a son of one of the earliest settlers
of the Continent. On the maternal
side, also, Mrs. Atherton is
descended from one of the oldest
Australian families, her grand-
mother, Mrs. Boles, having spent
sixty-seven years in the backblocks
of New South Wales and had reached
her sixty-eighth year before being
vouchsafed a sight of the sea. Of the
union there is a family of one son
and three daughters —John Carman,
Maud Lucy, Kathleen Gertrude, and
Violet Mary. ERNEST ALBERT
ATHERTON was born on March
22, 1879, at "Emerald End” Sta-
tion, where his earlier education
was conducted. He later attended
the Cairns State School, at which he
studied until reaching the age of
seventeen, when he became employed
in pastoral work at "Emerald End.”
Subsequently, during the period that
his brother was similarly engaged at
Mungana, he followed butchering at
Chillagoe, where he conducted a
business for Mr. William Atherton
for six years. When O.K. sprung
into existence as the centre for what
was for a time a prolific copperfield,
he opened a store there, which he
ran in person for four years, finally
selling out to open up at Cloncurry.
Finding the prospects of that dis-
tinct not up to expectations, he
returned to the Tableland and estab-
lished himself at Alma-den, where
he suffered a severe reverse owing to
the destruction of his premises by
fire. His enterprise at Alma-den
being thus terminated he proceeded
to Mareeba, where he made a fresh
start in the butchering trade, carry-
ing on a business here for the period
of about six years preceding his
association with Mr. J. G. Atherton
in the purchase of the important con-
cern which now engages the energies
of both partners, who were also in-
terested in sugar production for a
short time. Mr. E. A. Atherton is
prominent in various phases of public
activity, being the present chairman
of the Woothakata Shire and a
former holder of that office on the
council of the Barron Shire during
the five years immediately preceding
its amalgamation with the Wootha-
kata body. He was one of the com-
mittee of the Northern Patriotic
Council, a body which during and
since the War achieved splendid
results for the benefit of returned
soldiers and their dependents. The
brothers are supporters of the
Northern Country Party. Mr. E.
A. Atherton is a committeeman of
the Cairns Jockey Club, and both
he and Mr. J. G. Atherton are
among the valued patrons of the
sport in Cairns and its district. The
former is a member of the Cairns
Harbour Board and on the com-
mittee of the Cairns Pastoral and
Agricultural Society. In the year

1912 he married Honoria, daughter
of Mr. H. M. Svendsen, a native of
Denmark and a pioneer of the
Cairns district, in which he has
resided for about forty years. Of
the union there is a family of two
sons, Ernest Canning and Henry
Marinins.


The late JOHN SUMMER-
HAYES. Than this, no name
stands out more prominently in the
lists of those who, while playing
their parts as builders of Empire,
MR. J. SUMMERHAYES,
witnessed the foundation, the rapid
rise to prosperity, and the gradual
decline of the picturesque and
favourably situated little town whose
site the great navigator, Captain
James Cook, discovered in June of
the year 1770. Born in England at
a place called Currie Rival, in
December, 1855, the late gentleman
came of an old English family, and
was of that sturdy farming stock
which has been so notably repre-
sented in the settling of new lands.
His name has been associated with
the history of the Far North since
the year 1883 which witnessed his
arrival in Cooktown. In the course
of his long residence here he became
prominent among the mining men of
the district as a large speculator, and
played a very active part in com-
munal affairs being one of the aider-
men of the town. He was among
those, also, who notably furthered
the interests of clean sport, taking a
leading part in local racing affairs
as the owner of good mounts which
secured their share of trophies. A
keen business man, the connection
which he established for the local
meat supply was the largest in the
Cooktown district, while other ven-
tures were also most successful. The
latter included the taking over of
the principal hotel of Cooktown, the
Great Northern, which he ran on
lines well calculated to ensure its
popularity. In all his undertakings
he was assisted by the unfailing
support and encouragement of the
good lady who shared the “ups and
downs” of his long and useful career,
and who proved thus the unapprais-
able value of the comradeship which
wifehood and motherhood implies.
Upright, sturdily independent, far-
seeing and capable as he was, Mr.
Summerhayes will be best remem-
bered for the kindliness of his
nature and for the many acts which
exemplified their possession. He
married Kate Fairbrother, daughter
of John Fairbrother, of Bristol,
England, and is survived by a family
of two sons and two daughters who
have proved worthy of their parent-
age and the race from which they

spring. The sons, following in the
footsteps of the founder of the
family in the Far North, do what is
in their power to further the interests
of the town which for its fine natural
harbour, its splendid back country
and great mineral resources awaiting
development, bids fair to hold an
important place in the future des-
tinies of the State. Both were
educated in Cooktown, John, the
elder, having been born there on
September 18, 1891. On reaching a
suitable age he entered the butcher-
ing business founded by his father
in the middle eighties and for so
long under the direct control of the
late gentleman, since whose demise,
in conjunction with his brother, he
has personally carried on the work
of management, supervising, also,
as a member of the firm of Summer-
hayes Bros., the Great Northern,
Cooktown’s leading hotel, with
which the family name has continued
to be associated for several years.
Mr. John Summerhayes married in
the year 1914, Queenie, daughter of
Mr. George Symons, a well-known
identity of the town, and his family
consists of one son and two
daughters. The local public bodies
in which he has held membership in
the interests of the community are
the Municipal Council and General
Hospital. Charles Summerhayes, the
younger son of the pioneer, was born
on August 23, 1893. He was a vol-
unteer for service during the Great
War of 1914-18, desiring to partici-
pate in operations abroad, but
though accepted for service as a
member of the A.1.F., he was
retained in clerical work in Bris-
bane, his great wish to share the
hard life and fare of his comrades
in action being destined to dis-
appointment. With the restoration
of peace he returned to Cooktown
where he has since been engaged
with Mr. John Summerhayes in the
direction of the firm’s butchering and
other interests. He is committeeman
of the Pastoral and Agricultural
Association and takes an active

part in every movement instituted
for the progress of Cooktown and
its district, being prominent also
in sporting affairs as captain of the
local rifle club and as a committee-
man of the Cooktown Jockey Club.


JOHN HINDMARSH FUL-
FORD, "Springfield’’ Station, via
Cairns, is a son of the late John Ful-
ford, a Queensland pioneer of the
sixties. Born in 1840 in Northam,
MR. J. FULFORD.
near Bideford, Devon, England, the
late gentleman came of an ancient
family that played a notable part in
many of the historic events constitut-
ing the history of England; and of
which it was recorded in the late
eighties that "no family in Devon-
shire can pretend to show a longer
possession of, and residence upon, one
of the most important properties in
that County, save possibly, Kelly of
Kelly and Edgcumbe, of Edg-
cumbe.” The property referred to is
“Great Fulford,” which came into
the possession of the ancestors of the
subject of our memoir in the 12th
century, and continued to be the res-
idence of the family heirs in direct
male line from the time of the third
Henry. During the Civil War
"Great Fulford” was besieged by
Fairfax and brought to ruin before
its owners capitulated to him in 1645.
The family has been represented in
Church and State throughout its
history down to recent times, when
it contributed a metropolitan to
Canada in the person of the late
Bishop Fulford of Montreal. Mr.
Fulford landed at Brisbane in the
year 1861, and put his education and
ability at the service of a butcher,
in whose employ he gained an insight
into the possibilities of trade. Sub-
sequently, he joined one Robert Bair
in a butchering venture in South
Brisbane, but, his initiative finally
meeting with failure, sold out and
proceeded to Grafton, on the Clar-
ence River, New South Wales, to
visit his aunt, Mrs. W. Hindmarsh.
From Grafton he went to‘‘Dyraaba,”
a cattle station on the Richmond
River N.S.W., and thence to
"Etterick” Station, near Casino,
which was under the management of
Mr. Donald Campbell. After a
period spent at "Etterick” for
"colonial experience,” he made one
of a droving party commissioned to
travel a mob to Goulburn, New
South Wales. During this trip he
gained valuable experience in a very
hard school, and on its completion
returned to the Clarence. Finding
his relatives on the eve of moving to
MU. J. H. FULFOED.
the Tweed, he assisted in the
arrangements in progress and accom-
panied them to their destination,
where he also' took up a selection,
which he put under corn. After
harvesting a crop and erecting a
dwelling, he received and accepted
the offer of a post as drover in charge
of bulls to be travelled from New
South Wales to "Dotswood” Station,
in the vicinity of which, at a later
date, Charters Towers sprang into
existence. On his return to the South
he got together a mob of bulls, which,
in 1869, he overlanded to Northern
Queensland for sale on his own
account. In October of the following
y r ear he made his advent to "Lynd-
hurst” Station, which was then
under the management of Mr. Smith
of the firm of Bundock, Barnes and
Smith; and from there visited “Car-
pentaria Downs,” a station still
further to the north, where he con-
tracted a severe attack of fever and
ague. On his recovery he applied
himself to the further study of stock
and pastoral conditions at "Lynd-
hurst,” to which property, having
proceeded south for the purpose, he
brought his wife and infant daughter
in March of the year 1871. The
homestead, which served the purpose
for several years later, was then a
slab-walled, bark-roofed structure
fitted up in the most primitive
fashion, most of the furniture being
home-made and the toilet ware of tin,
a tin bucket serving as a bedroom
jug. It was, however, as fresh and
clean as the bush air surrounding it
—the wife of a neighbouring settler,
Mrs. McKinley, having made it as
home-like as possible—and soon
received those added touches which
tell of a gentlewoman’s pervading
influence. Here Mrs. Fulford became
the centre of an environment des-
tined to be hallowed by the happy
associations and sacred sorrows that
the word "home” embodies. With
her husband and baby, she accom-
plished the journey from Townsville
—a distance of 250 miles over rough
country—in a spring cart over which
a tilt had been erected to shield them

from the sun. Many discomforts were
necessarily experienced before they
arrived at the station, not the least
being the submersion of their stores,
higgage, ete., in the Burdekin’


which, crossing near Dalrymple, the
pioneer found to be a strong cur-
rent and deeper than he antici-
pated. For years, many of his
wife’s experiences at "Lyndhurst”
demanded both courage and endur-
ance, it being in her case, as in that
of numberless women of the bush, no
uncommon occurrence to be left days
at a time with no companionship
save that of a domesticated aboriginal
woman or a Chinese cook. The
blacks were a continual menace and
had committed various murders in
the district, and, to protect herself
and her children from possible
molestation during her husband’s
enforced absences, she used to sleep
with a loaded rifle beside her bed
and a revolver beneath her pillow.
Mr. Fulford was appointed to the
management of "Lyndhurst” shortly
after his return to the station in
1871, and carried out the duties of
the position for the following twenty-
six years, having in the meantime
become part owner of the property.
On his taking over the reins of
administration the improvements on
the run consisted of the yards
in the vicinity of the home-
stead; the mustering yards at "The
Lynd” and "Phantom Creek”—
(distant outstations), and a very
small horse paddock. Under his
management considerable headway
was made in the way of development,
Bowen and Biboohra, the last-men-
tioned being established at a time
when, the market being glutted with
fats, the outlook for the pastoralist
was most serious. A contemporary
of Mr. Fulford’s was Mr. Mytton of
"Oak Park” and "Wando Vale,” and
it was the practice of these two
gentlemen to join forces when one

station or the other was experiencing
a specially busy time. They also
worked in conjunction when supply-
ing the butchers. During the early
part of his administration, the
Palmer goldfield was discovered, and
the influx of miners and settlers to
the newly formed township resulted
in a big demand for beef cattle, for
which Mr. Fulford received on
August 3, 1874, the highest price
£3 16s. per oz., which, accompanied
by Messrs. Gough (a well-known
police inspector of his day) and
Mytton, he conveyed to the A. J. S.
Bank in Townsville, where it was
deposited on August 19, 1874, being
valued at £3,344. Mr. Fulford’s
good work gave great satisfaction to
his partners, who, on the completion
of Uis first three years of manage-
ment, presented him with a testi-
monial as an expression of their
appreciation. Fie became part
owner with Mr. Harry Williams of
"Springfield” Station in the year
18«1, rfiough he continued to con-
trol "Lyndfiurst” as managing
partner until 1897. After devoting
two years to tfie direction of the
former property, he embarked on a
voyage to tfie Motherland. Shortly
after his return he became sole
owner of the property, his partner-
ship with Mr. Williams having been
dissolved in the year 1900, when
"Springfield” was sold by auction.
He became the purchaser of the area
at a period shortly preceding the
close of his useful career as a Queens-
land pioneer—a career that was in-
terwoven with the events and inci-
dents that built up the history of
this part of the State, and which
ended in Cairns as a result of typhoid
fever on April 10, 1901. Apart

ality, his high principles of honour

backs which attended the exertions
of a pastoralist of the period. Cattle
varied in value, and, realizing the in-
stability of markets, he did much in

long remembered as a successful
breeder of Herefords, an excellent
judge of stock, and for his efforts in
the formation of pastoral and agri-
cultural associations in Townsville
and Charters Towers. For both the
Towers and Townsville bodies, he
frequently acted as judge, and in


both centres he was a most success-
ful exhibitor of stock. He was well
known as an authority on thorough-
bred horses, and as a keen lover of
racing, though his mounts were never
entered for any but picnic grass-fed
events. He married in the sixties,

He actively interests himself in
affairs of sport and for many years
past has held the presidentships of
the Lyndhurst and Mount Surprise
Amateur Race Clubs. On October
12, 1904, he married Alice Laviuia,
daughter of Mr. Stewart of Hermit
Park, Townsville, to whom belongs
the distinction of being one of the


first arrivals by boat to the mouth of
the Burdekin River. Two daughters,
Margaret Grace and Cicely May, are
the issue of the union. Mr. Fulford
has a fund of interesting reminis-
censes. Among these he relates of
his late father’s partner, Mr. Harry
Williams, a pioneer who came north
with the first mobs of cattle sent
hither by Robert Towns, that on one
occasion at “Springfield,” when alone
on the run, he was surprised by a
party of blacks who inflicted with a
tomahawk such terrible wounds on
his head and neck that it was a
matter of wonder that he was ever
able to return to the homestead, to
which he rode, after fainting several
times on the way. Mr. Fulford was
at the first Townsville Show, held
on August 18, 1880, when his father
was awarded several prizes for Here
ford cattle and for a hack named
“Dandy.” As a small boy at “Lynd-
hurst,” he recalls being shown a
bullet that, fired by a bushranger at
Mr. Henry Smith, his father’s pre-
decessor as manager of the station,
had lodged in a door post. It was the
object of this bushranger, a tall
powerful man known as “Waddy
Mundoe” (who was overpowered but
managed to free himself and make his
escape), to secure gold dust, of which
he imagined there was a supply on
the station, as Mr. Smith had a
short time previously been paid in
gold for a mob of cattle. Gold at
that time (the seventies) was the
usual medium of exchange for stock,
and invariably paid on the station
before delivery, being handed over
in long chamois leather bags, buyer
and seller together valuing and
weighing the metal, which was often
buried for safety and in due course
taken to the nearest bank. At
“Lyndhurst” it was no uncommon
thing to see cattle brought in from
the run with blacks’ spears still
clinging to their hides, so frequent
being the depredations amongst the
stock that it was necessary to have
stationed at the adjoining holding,
“Oak Park,” a body of native police
who were told off in companies to
patrol certain districts. During Mr.
Fulford’s childhood at “Lyndhurst,”
the white cook at “The Lynd,’’ an
outstation, received a spear in his
chest while working at dusk opposite
a small window. Instantly removing
the weapon, he seized his revolver
and pursuing his black assailant saw
him make for McKinnon’s Creek
nearby and dive from a precipitous
bank into a deep waterhole, where
he disappeared after receiving a
bullet in the point of the shoulder.
The event proved that neither of the.
men was dangerously wounded, the

JOHN McDIARMID RAMSAY,
Port Douglas, Northern Queensland,
was born at Stratherick, Inverness-
shire, Scotland, on October 7, 1834.
He is descended from two old
MR. J. MOD. RAMSAY.
Highland families, the Ramsays and
McDiarmids, who rank amongst the
most historically noted in the country
north of the Grampians. Possessed
of an adventurous spirit which found
little outlet under nineteenth cen-
tury conditions in the Old World, he
set out when in his middle twenties
for the young Continent in the
Southern hemisphere, judging he
would there find conditions worthy
of any man’s challenging and of a
sort offering no small element of
excitement. He was not dis-
appointed, for his early experience of
life in his adopted country was
gained on the Goulburn River gold-
fields in Victoria, which in the early
days possessed the fascination which
attached to the original diggings.
For sixteen years he pursued the
quest for the yellow metal in differ-
ent parts of Australia, his peregrina-
tions leading him through New
South Wale® and finally to Queens-
land, where he witnessed the opening
up of the Peak Downs field, and,
following the various rushes,
roughed it at Rosewood, Morinish,
Ridgeland, Herberts Creek, Calliope,
and eventually at the Hodgkinson,
where he became well known. Cook-
town knew him in its prosperous
days; and later he made his way to
Cairns, where, for a time, he was
active in the timber trade. When
Port Douglas was established as a
township he proceeded to that centre
associating himself with the timber
industry, and during the period that
the township was still in its infancy
he became a pioneer of commerce,
starting on his own account as a
general merchant. His business ex-
panded, though in its conduct he
experienced the usual ups and downs
consequent on trade fluctuations,
bad seasons, and other causes, but by
good management he overcame all
adversities, retaining the reins of
active proprietorship for nearly half
a century. This fine old pioneer, who
in his ninetieth year is still in har-
ness, devoted much of his leisure in
the j)ast to public affairs tending to
the advantage of the district and
community, among the bodies with
which he prominently associated
himself being the Douglas Shire
Council. He married at the Port
over thirty years ago, and has a
family of four sons and five
daughters.
The late JAMES REYNOLDS
was a descendant of a family bearing
one of the most ancient names of
Northern Ireland, many successive
generations of his progenitors having
been well known and highly esteemed
in County Fermanagh. He came to
Australia with his parents in the
year 1841, being then a child of
three, and his early life was
spent in the South. When a
young man he overlanded to
Queensland, arriving on the Darling
Downs as the owner of bullock teams
which he there sold to Messrs. Kellet
and Spry, who were on the eve of
proceeding to “Natal Downs,” a
holding which they had recently
taken up in the country then fring-
ing settlement in the North. Enter-
ing the employ of these gentlemen as
a driver, he took the first loading to
“Natal Downs,” suffering many pri-
vations and hardships on the journey
over the vast mileage of sparsely
settled country intervening between
his starting point and his destina-
tion. During this and many similar
trips the aborigines were much in
evidence, and to avoid surprise
attacks or casual encounters with
them, it was necessary to be con-
tinually on the alert and to push on,
often without sleep for days together,
until settlement of some kind was
reached. For many years following
his advent to the station he had
charge of the supply waggons over-
landing to and from Bowen, this
being long before Charters Towers —
now its nearest centre of importance
—was thought of. When Townsville
came into existence, he became
similarly engaged over the route to
that centre, where, in 1869, he
established a butchering business
which he conducted for four years.
When the Cape River goldfield came
into prominence he was hotel-keeping
in the locality, conducting this busi-
ness in addition to his butchery in
Townsville. Before the close of 1873,
the diggings then offering excellent
opportunities for teamsters, he was
engaged in the carriage of supplies
between Townsville and the gold-
field, and later, when Cooktown was
established, continued operations
from that centre. In Cooktown he
engaged in hotel-keeping for a time,
subsequently following the same call-
ing on the Palmer and Hodgkinson
goldfields. From the Hodgkinson he
hailed to Port Douglas in the year
1883, taking up, as one of the early
settlers of the district, the holding
which was destined to be his home
for the following twenty-two years,
and on which his widow yet resides.
For some time he engaged in fruit-
growing, but when the mill was
established, turned his attention to

his public-spiritedness as a councillor
of the Douglas Shire and a partici-
pator in every movement instituted
for the benefit of the community,


contributing to the district’s pro-
gress. James Reynolds died in the
year 1905 at the age of sixty-five.
He married in Townsville, in 1869,
Margaret Logue, a member of the
family whose name is its best indica-
tion of its prominence in national
affairs, Irishmen bearing it having
been notably to the fore as statesmen,
patriots, and Church dignitaries in
different parts of the world since the
Emerald Isle was Christianized. Mrs.
Reynolds, during the times of trial
and stress that largely make up the
sum of pioneering existence, personi-
fied all that is best in the terms wife,
mother, and neighbour. In rough
mining centres where there was no
medical aid, her resourcefulness stood
in good stead not only for her own
family but for all to whom she could
render assistance, and her kindliness,
charity, and hospitality are doubt-
less among the happiest memories of
the many to whom they were
accorded. To the pioneer was born
a family of three sons and four
daughters. His second son, JAMES
PATRICK REYNOLDS, J.P.,

continued to follow on the lines his
father so worthily laid down, was

adjoining that upon which his child-
hood had been spent, he became
questions of wide issue, and since his
advent to manhood has keenly fol-
lowed the trend of political economy.
He received the Commission of
the Peace under the Kidston Admin-
istration, and since 1907 has taken
an active part in local politics
and government, having for fourteen
years, with the exception of a single
break, been appointed at the head
of the poll as a councillor of the Port
Douglas Shire. Tire break referred
to was after his first three years in
office, when he was defeated by one
vote. He was appointed chairman
of the Council on six consecutive
occasions, holding that honour in
1913, and again in 1915, completing
an unbroken term of office in 1920.
A Liberal-Democrat in politics, he
is a keen supporter of the White
Australia policy, the soundness of his
views on this question being demon-
strated by the progress of the sugar
industry in the Far North, where, in
his opinion as in that of many
others, the climate is as healthy as
in any part of the world. He is a
prominent Oddfellow and has been
the holder of all honorary offices of
that lodge. In the year 1907 Mr.
Reynolds married Mary, daughter of
born in Thornbo rough, Northern
Queensland, on March 24, 1878, and
educated at Port Douglas, where, on
ending his schooldays, he elected
to be employed on the home farm.

WILLIAM JONAS WEBB,
Cooktown, was born in Suffolk, Eng-
land, on March 5, 1848, and came
with his father to the Moreton Bay
Territory, as Queensland was at that
time designated, in the year 1855,
MR. W. J. WEBB.
being then a child of seven. A weaver
by trade, the founder of the Webb
family in this State found jio
demand for one of his calling in his
adopted country, and therefore sup-
ported his wife and children by such
employment as he could secure, for
many years after his arrival having
a big struggle to make suitable pro-
vision for them. Before he had
reached the age of ten, Mr. W. J.
Webb was contributing towards his
own upkeep as a shepherd in the
New England district, and for
several years preceding the discovery
of the Gympie goldfield engaged in
various descriptions of stock work.
He was one of the early arrivals at
Gympie, and since 1867 has been
more or less identified with the great
industry which has figured so largely
in the history of the country’s devel-
opment, ranking now as the oldest
living prospector of the Cooktown
and Palmer districts. During a
period spread over nearly sixty years
he has learned practically all that
there is to know about gold and the
baser metals; and, a master of
bush craft, he has explored much of
the hinterland of the port of Cook-
town, and of this most prolific
though yet sparsely settled portion
of the vast territory of Northern
Queensland is recognized as one of
the most noteworthy pioneers*
Familiar as he is with the great
latent possibilities of the Cooktown
district, and foreseeing that in time
the picturesque little town with its
fine natural harbour must come into
its own as a thriving seaport, he
hardly realizes perhaps the import-
ance of the part he has personally
played in the making of history in
this distant outpost of Empire.
There are none of his own to per-
petuate his line in his adopted
country, but his good work has
earned for his name a lasting place
in Queensland annals.
The late CHARLES PATCH-
ING, founder of the family of
which Mr. CHARLES PATCH-
ING, solicitor, of Cooktown, North-
ern Queensland, is now the head.
Born at Brighton, England, and
the son of a builder and contractor
in the Motherland, the subject of
this memoir personified a fine type of
English-born colonist whose com-
mercial instinct, sturdy enterprise,
and unflagging industry were largely
responsible for the early develop-
ment and progress of every portion
of the great Continent under the
Southern Cross. Of a temperament
essentially enterprising, he struck
out for himself at the age of four-
teen, shortly afterwards venturing
upon the long overseas voyage to
New Zealand. Here he saw much
of life until fate led him to Cler-
mont, North-western Queensland,
where in the sixties he directed a
bakery, store, and an aerated waters
business. The good results of his
efforts in Clermont were ruined in
a single night by the disastrous flood
which submerged the Peak Downs
district in 1869, a misfortune which
made necessary a new start. With
his wife and two infant sons, he
accordingly set out upon the over-
land journey to Broughton, where
the young couple established them-
selves as hotel and store-keepers,
and continued to engage in business
until the sensational news of the dis-
covery of payable gold on the Palmer
River in 1873 imbued Mr. Patch-
ing with the desire of testing his
fortunes as a gold seeker. This
desire was put in the way of realiza-
tion in the same year, when the
family landed at Cooktown, the port
for the field. Their first home in
Cooktown was a tent occupying a
site almost opposite the monument
since erected to the memory of Cap-
tain Cook, the world’s greatest
navigator, and they remained at
this habitation for some time, the
pioneer meanwhile engaging in
carting in conjunction with Mr.
William Jonas Webb, the oldest sur-
viving prospector of the Cooktown
and Palmer River districts. At
Cooktown another son, Henry
Endeavour, was born, the first male
child to see the light in the yet most
northerly seaport of the State. As
soon as practicable, Mr. and Mrs.
Patching and their children moved
on to Maytown, the nearest centre
to the goldfield, residing here for
a lengthy period, the breadwinner
interesting himself in many of the
mining shows on the Palmer in and
around Maytown, at the same time
engaging most successfully in busi-
ness in the lines of store-keeping and
aerated waters. In course of time
their family numbered four sons and
one daughter, all of whom were sent
to Cooktown for their education, the
parents continuing to make May-
town their headquarters until the

rush to the more recently discovered
Hodgkinson field resulted in the
practical abandonment of the
Palmer. Mr. Patching’s faith in
the latter’s potentialities never
waned, however, and he retained a


fourth share in the first number of
the Ida prospecting claim, which, he
confidently predicted, but awaited
the capital necessary for its develop-
ment to produce tons of gold. This
claim was one of the boring sites

lately tested by an expert borer on
behalf of the Government of Queens-
land, and should it and other Palmer
shows fulfil the expectations formed
of them, the whole Shire of Cook
and the town which is its natural
port will receive the impetus
needed to create a populous and
thriving district. The pioneer
throughout his lengthy sojourn in
the Far North consistently asserted
his belief that the Palmer would yet
be the largest and most productive
goldfield in Australia, and that
Cooktown would one day rank as a
city. On leaving Maytown he
opened in the port an aerated water
factory, the conduct of which occu-
pied him for many years. His
enterprising spirit was evident to
the last —a spirit which helped him
through the trials, hardships, and
vicissitudes of his earlier life and
dominated the ventures which re-
sulted in the acquirement of con-
siderable capital and a nature which
spent as freely as it acquired. On
September 16, 1913, within a
few moments of his return from
Townsville, where he had been on
holiday, he was seized with a heart
attack, caused doubtless by the
exertion of travelling and the excite-
ment of home-coming, and almost
immediately afterwards peacefully
passed away. He is yet mourned
by a devoted family as the best of
fathers, and by the community of
which he had been so long a mem-
ber, as a most useful and upright
citizen. His good wife, Elizabeth
Annie Patching, nee Crowley, whom
he married in Clermont in the
sixties and who predeceased him in
the year 1904, was as widely
regretted, her kindheartedness and
true womanly characteristics having
been well known to a large circle of
friends in Northern Queensland.
Mr. and Mrs. Patching had a family
of five sons and two daughters. The
eldest, the late William Benjamin
Patching, formerly engaged in busi-
ness in Samarai, where he contracted
the fever and other ailments then
prevalent in that part of Papua,
and as a result, heart trouble,
which caused his death in Christ

where both she and her husband
earned the esteem of their fellow-
citizens. The youngest son of the
late Charles Patching, George Robert
Arnold, became the postmaster of
Nanango, and the only surviving
daughter now resides at Atherton.
CHARLES PATCHING, the pio-
neer’s eldest living son, who was
born at Clermont, enjoys the dis-
tinction of being the first winner of
a boy’s scholarship from the Cook-
town State School. From Cooktown
he entered the Brisbane Grammar
School, where, after three years, he
gained a further scholarship and
the Lilley Silver Medal, passing also
the Junior and Senior IJniversitv
examinations. On the completion of
five years’ study in Brisbane he
returned to Cooktown, where he was
articled to Mr. J. Y. S. Barnett,
now of Roberts, Leu, & Barnett,
solicitors, Townsville. He remained
with Mr. Barnett for five years,
passing his final examination in
law in the year 1898. Return-
ing to Cooktown he entered
upon the practice of his pro-
fession there, the duties of which
have since occupied his energies.
Mr. Patching should be recorded as
one of the most public-spirited men
of his district. He was for ten
years president of the Cook District
Hospital and the Cooktown Chamber
of Commerce, and during his career
of citizenship has been one of the
most zealous advocates and supporters
of Liberalism in this part of the
State. For a decade, too, he was
president of the Cooktown Turf Club.
He married in May of the year 1898
Catherine, the eldest daughter of
Owen Reynolds, a pioneer of the
Cook district and the oldest sur-
viving carrier and hotel-keeper of
the town. Mr. Reynolds carted the
first load of Government building
material to the Coen in Cape York
Peninsula and the first machinery to
the Annan tinfields. He now lives
in retirement at the home of hie son-
in-law, his wife, Mary Reynolds,
nee Connors, having passed away in
the year 1897 when still in the bloom
of life. This lady was survived by
one son and four daughters, who
with their father mourn the loss of
one who was revered for her many
estimable qualities by all who knew
her, whose charity and kindliness of
heart were unbounded, and whose
efforts in the cause of humanity,
though performed quietly and un-
ostentatiously, are yet living mem-
ories to the many who in the early

town, owner of “Strathleven”

son of James Gordon, of “Fernvale,”
and a grandson of the late James
Gordon, formerly of “Cattle Hill”
Station in the vicinity of Bowen,
and who, hailing from the North of
Ireland, where, in County Antrim,
his line had been established cen-
turies earlier, came to Australia with
his wife, six sons and six daughters
by the sailing ship, “Maryborough,”
in the year 1864. The original James
Gordon was born in 1811, and died
in Australia about eighty years
later, in July, 1890. On arrival in
this country he leased a farm on
Euri Creek, about ten miles from
Bowen. Shortly afterwards, he
settled down as a grazier at a place
which lies twenty-five miles from the
town and which, after his advent
thereto, became known as Gordon’s
Glen. He secured land in the neigh-
bourhood of the well-known coastal
landmark, Roma Peak, and depas-
tured the area with horned stock,
designating it “Cattle Hill.” In the
Bowen district his four youngest
children were bom, making the num-
ber of his family sixteen. The line
which he founded under the South-
ern Cross has been closely asso-
ciated with the pastoral industry for
nearly sixty years. His son and
namesake, the father of Mr. James
Gordon, of “Strathleven,” and
grandfather of Mr. James Gordon,
of Innisfail, was born in County
Antrim in the year 1846, being
about eighteen years of age at the
time of his arrival in Australia. He
struck out for himself some five years
later (about 1869), taking up and
forming virgin country into a cattle
station which he called “Fernvale.”
This property thenceforward con-
tinued to be his headquarters, and
now from his home here, looking
back upon more than half a century
of Australian history, may recall
a host of interesting experiences.
He was in charge of the first mob
of fat cattle shipped from Bowen to
Cooktown by their owner, Jack
Johnson, in 1874 or thereabouts;
and in the early days of his first
pastoral venture kept things going

by operating as a carrier, having en-
gaged in his arduous calling for some
years during which he was considered
one of the most reliable teamsters
plying the vast distances between
Bowen on the North Queensland
coast and “Mount Cornish” Sta-
tion, near Aramac, Central-Western
Queensland. He also accomplished a
considerable amount of carrying to
Ravenswood, when that centre was
first proclaimed a goldfield and the
route to Bowen newly opened. In-
numerable privations and hardships,
many and severe setbacks such as
were the common lot of the pioneers,
were borne by Mr. Gordon and the
helpmeet who kept the home together
during his long absences; but by in-
domitable pluck and perseverance
and the seizing of right opportuni-
ties, he was eventually able to relin-
quish carrying and devote himself
solely to his pastoral interests, which
he enlarged in the year 1895 with
the purchase and stocking up of a
holding on the Bogie River, near
Eton Yale. He held this property
for many years, finally selling it and
becoming the owner of the historic
“Mount Pleasant” Station, also in
the Bowen district. “Mount Pleas-
ant” Station has been in the family
for about ten years, and this pro-
perty and other interests acquired by
him are now conducted as company
concerns in partnership with Messrs.
Edward H. and G. K. Gordon, the
two youngest of his four sons, the
second of whom, Robert, named
after his uncle, Mr. Robert Gordon,
of Atherton, is a member of the firm
of Stewart & Gordon, owners of
“Starkie” Station, pastoralists and
sugar growers of the Gordonvale dis-
trict. JAMES GORDON, of
“Strathleven,” was born at “Fern-
vale” on March 23, 1877. Being
the eldest son, he became his father’s
right hand before he reached the age
of nine, when he was taken on his
first trip with the teams as spare
boy. About the year 1895, as a
young man of eighteen, he took over
the working of the Bogie River
property, in which he continued to

be engaged for the following five
years. In 1900, leaving his brother
ir charge, he accepted from Messrs.
Munro & Gordon the management
of “Gamboola” and “Highbury”


Stations, in the Gulf district. He
personally controlled these properties
until 1905, when he took up his resi-
dence at “Wrotham Park,” then re-
cently acquired by the firm with which
he was associated and for whom he
thenceforward for five years acted
as general manager of their pastoral
interests. In 1909, he made his first
independent start in the industry
with the purchase of “Strathleven”
Station, south-west of Cooktown, in
the Far North. He placed on
“Strathleven” a small herd,
that, by breeding and further
purchases, soon increased in num-
bers to the full carrying capa-
city of the area; and in 1917
purchased “Strathburn,” a property
140 miles further north, to which he
opened a road with his stock through
country previously untravelled and
regarded as impassable. He also
opened up the first road between
“Gamboola” and “Strathleven,” a
distance of seventy miles, and made
the first wheel track over the greater
portion of the 100 miles dividing the
latter run from the township of
Laura. At a comparatively recent
date he took up portion of the coun-
try separating “Strathleven” and

Swedish stock, of which members of
successive generations engaged in
farming pursuits. His father fol-
lowed carpentering as a trade,
though, like his forbears, he inter-
ested himself also in agriculture.
Before reaching his teens Mr. P. E.
Seagren terminated his school days
and started life on his own account,
and at the end of three years, during
which he was occupied as a cattle
herd, secured an apprenticeship with
a cabinetmaker. During the four
years that this apprenticeship lasted
he received no salary, so for his pre-
sent needs he obtained employment
of a more immediately profitable
nature to occupy his leisure hours.
Realizing the necessity of education
for advancement in any walk of life,
he seized every possible opportunity
of improving his mind, devoting such
evenings as he could spare to study
at a night school. After his appren-
ticeship was completed he added to
his trade and general knowledge in
different Swedish towns, and on
reaching manhood proceeded to
Copenhagen, where he was employed
at cabinetmaking for three years.
He had not yet arrived at his middle
twenties when, taking a passage from
Hamburg by the sailing ship “The
Gotten berg,” he yielded to a long-
entertained desire of seeing the
young continent under the Southern
Cross, and in due course he com-
pleted the long overseas voyage to
the country of his adoption, landing
at Rockhampton, Central Queens-
land, in the year 1871. Having no
knowledge of English, he found him-
self considerably handicapped in
regard to obtaining employment at
his trade, so he secured field work,
and within a short time acquired a
fair acquaintance with the language.
With the discovery of gold on the
Palmer River he hastened in the
direction of this field, and in the
beginning of February, 1874, landed
at Cooktown, the picturesque centre
with the progress of which he has
since been so prominently associated.
On reaching Cooktown he found that
the journey to the diggings meant
considerable outlay, including £BO
for the purchase of a horse, and an
appreciable sum for rations, flour
being at the rate of 2s. 6d. per half-
pint pannikin. As his whole capital
amounted to the sum of £5O, he
decided to set himself up in his trade
in the port. Putting this intention
into effect, he has since shown how
even in a distant outpost of Empire
such as Cooktown men of his
calibre play no insignificant part in
the work of nation-building. He
has laboured for the improvement of
the town with unsparing enerp-v,
and the excellent condition of the
streets, footpaths, and other public
works is due to his progressive
methods when mayor, a capacity in
which he acted for nine years. Dur-
ing his membership of the Municipal
Council, which was spread over a
quarter of a century, he never once
missed a meeting of the body. For
many years he was a member of the
Shire Council, the Hospital Com-
mittee, the School Advisory Board,
and other institutions, and as an
example of the appreciation in which
he has long been held by the towns-
people, we quote the following ex-
tract from an illuminated address
which was presented to him on an
occasion twenty-five years ago:
“We avail ourselves of this pleasing
opportunity to express our esteem
and goodwill towards you and our
high appreciation of your sterling
qualities as a citizen and man, noted
in your public and private capacities
for singleness of purpose, rectitude
of action, and the will to do what is
right for right’s sake.” The public
bodies with which he was connected
took advantage of the same occasion,
the twenty-fifth anniversary of his
wedding day, to present him with an
address phrased in a similar strain.
He is a large landholder in the town,
and probably no man in Queensland
holds a higher place in the esteem of
his fellows than does Mr. Seagren,
whose public and private life have
always been such as to command the
utmost respect. In the year 1873 he
married, at Rockhampton, Rosetta
Bradish, a native of London, Eng-
land, who emigrated to Australia
somewhat later in the year that wit-
nessed his own arrival in the country.

The Sugar Industry.
SUGAR-GROWING COUNTRIES.
The world’s production of sugar in 1921-22 repre-
sented 16,465,967 tons, and of that vast quantity the
cane sugar represented 11,503,467 tons, and beet sugar
4,962,500 tons.
The sugar-growing countries include, apart from
France, Germany, Austria and Russia, the great conti-
nental beet-growing countries, British India, United
States, the Philippine Islands, China, (including Amoy
and Swatow), the Straits Settlements, Japan, Formosa,
Java, Mexico, Cuba, San Domingo, Porto Rico,
Barbados, Trinidad, Jamaica, Windward and Leeward
Islands, Gaudaloupe, and Martinique. In Central
America are Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras, British
Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. In
South America we find Colombia, Venezuela, British
Guiana, Dutch Guiana, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil,
Argentina and Paraguay. In Africa we find sugar
grown in Madeira, Canary Islands, Angola, Liberia,
Egypt, Mozambique, Natal, and Mauritius. Then come
the Hawaiian Islands, Fiji, and Tahiti. Finally Austra-
lia, with sugar grown on the Northern Rivers of New
South Wales, and along the coast of Queensland from
Nambour River in the Blackall Range, north to the
Mossman River at Port Douglas, thirty-two miles north
of Cairns.
In the beginning of our sugar industry in Australia,
the legislators of the seventies saw the necessity of pro-
tecting our sugar growers from open competition with
the cheap sugars of Java, Mauritius, India, Amoy and
Swatow, where it was produced by cheap black or col-
oured labour at a cost impossible for sugar grown by
white labour—hence the protective duties of £5 per ton
on all imported raw sugar, and £6 13s. 4d. on all refined.
Even the kanaka labour, while it lasted in Queensland,
was not as cheap as the public imagined, all things con-
sidered, but it was absolutely reliable, and not subject
to strikes, and the planters and mill owners knew
exactly how they were situated.
The history of sugar-cane reads like a wild
romance. The origin of the plant, the place where it
first grew wild, is unknown, there being some evidence
that the original home was in India. It may have been
indigenous in a number of countries, including New
Guinea. It is mentioned in one of the Vedas, one of the
oldest of the Hindoo sacred poems, the Atharba Veda—
“I have crowned thee with a shooting sugar cane, so that
thou shalt not be averse to me.” Sugar-cane in India
is mentioned in the time of Alexander the Great, by the
Romans, Pliny and Strabo, and the Greek, Dioscorides.
It is frequently mentioned over 1,200 years ago, and
sugar in considerable quantities was made at that time
in India. Marco Polo in the thirteenth century refers
to many sugar factories in South China, where cheap
sugar could be bought. Sugar-cane was taken by the
Arabs and Chinese to Siam, the Philippines, Formosa,
and Japan. The Crusaders found sugar factories in
Palestine, Syria and Cyprus, and started their own plan-
tations and improved the quality of the sugar. There
were many mills and plantations found in Sicily in 1450,
and sugar-making was well known in Egypt, so that
the industry is very ancient and merely changed its
habitat from old countries to new. Doubtless in those
far-off days the mills in all countries were very primitive
affairs, and the boiling apparatus equally crude, but
some of the early mills in Queensland had two wooden
rollers, and the motive power consisted of one or two
pairs of bullocks or three or four horses, and the boiling
was done in a row of separate iron pots, and the molasses
drained off finally in long V-shaped wooden boxes, with
many gimlet holes along both sides. In those days it
was a wasteful system, and at least a fourth of the sugar
was left in the molasses.
In the countries around the Mediterranean planters
grew large quantities of sugar from the twelfth to the
sixteenth centuries, and Damascus and Tripoli were
sugar-refining centres, so the sugar men of those days
may have been acquainted with refining methods long
since forgotten. It is historically certain that the old
and now obsolete pyramid-shaped way of moulding white
sugar was made at least three centuries ago. Spaniards,
Portuguese and French spread the sugar-cane to
Jamaica, Cuba, San Domingo, Brazil and many other
places. The three first of these, all islands, became
the great sugar-growing centres, and even in 1802
Cuba exported 40,800 tons. The French colonies were
the most successful, but all sugar was then grown by
slave labour, and the French planters appear to have
treated theirs so badly on San Domingo, that they
mutinied in 1791, and exterminated the entire white
population and burned or destroyed the mills.


VIRGIN COUNTRY BEFORE BEING CLEARED FOR SUGAR-GROWING
kr2


The French introduced sugar-cane to Mauritius and
Reunion, then the “Isle de France,” and “Bourbon,”
which gave a name to the old Bourbon cane, the first to
take the rust in Queensland, where it was allowed to
become extinct. Sugar gradually vanished from Madeira
and the Cape Verde and Canary Islands, killed by the
slave-grown supplies from Brazil and the Antilles. Sugar-
growing in Java expanded until in 1710 the export repre-
sented 7,000 tons, but it declined until in 1760 it was
only 3,000 tons, the reason being given in the following
very expressive passage from an authentic history of that
period : —“lt was a very bad time for the sugar industry
during the last years of the eighteenth and the first of
the nineteenth centuries when France, at first by herself,
and then with her allies, was at war with Great Britain.
The principal hostilities were in West Indian waters,
where the French and British fleets not only destroyed
each other, but captured or sank a great number of fully-
laden merchant ships, with heavy losses to sugar planters
and merchants. East Indian and Javan sugar was often
captured by privateers or men-of-war, and the French
Government enacted all sorts of harassing laws and
regulations so as to deal a serious blow at British trade.
In the end Britain reigned supreme at sea and preserved
her trade relations with the continent in spite of Napo-
leon’s efforts to crush them out, and in 1806 he had
recourse to what is known as the 'Continental System,’
which eventually dealt a disastrous blow to the cane
sugar industry.”
That bridges the chasm between the old sugar-cane
system and advent of the beetroot, which was to be so
formidable a competitor. When Britain obtained control
of the sea she prohibited ships of all nationalities from
entering French harbours, in retaliation for Napoleon
stopping all commercial intercourse between Britain and
the Continent, or so much of it as he exercised control
over. Among outside supplies cut off from France was
that of sugar, and special efforts were made to produce
sugar from grapes and various other fruits, sorghum and
maize, and the juice of the maple, and beetroot, but only
grapes and beetroot gave any commercial supply, and
that fell far short of the demand. In 1747 a German
chemist, named Marggraf, had shown that sugar could
be obtained from beetroot and crystallized in a simple
manner, and in 1786 another man, named Achard,
started the cultivation of beet near Berlin, and
William 111. bought a lot of land in Silesia, and pro-
vided Achard with the means to conduct his experiments
on an extensive scale, so he and Achard were actually
the originators of beetroot sugar-growing in Europe.
In Germany, in 1810, the production of sugar from
beet was proved to be a success, while France still clung
entirely to the extraction of sugar from grapes, having
failed in the attempt at beet sugar, chiefly through
ignorance of the best method of manufacture and the
poor quality of the beet. Two French chemists, named
Proust and Parmentier, made grape sugar in large
quantities. Proust was the man who warned the French
not to try to make sugar from beet, as the French soil
would not grow beetroot containing sugar, as if there
were a radical difference between the soils of France and
Germany. Napoleon rewarded Proust with 100,000
francs, and Fouquet with 40,000 francs, on condition
that the money should be used to start grape sugar
factories in the south of France, and the secrets of manu-
facture were to be published. In the meantime the advo-
cates of the beet sugar were not idle, and finally Napoleon
decided to place the industry on a solid basis, and
ordered the planting of 32,000 hectares (about 75,000
acres) with beetroot, distributed over four provinces with
four schools, where sugar manufacture was to be taught
and all importation of sugar from the East and West
Indies was prohibited. The result of this was the erection
of 334 sugar factories, which in 1812-13 produced seven
million pounds of sugar. In that year, 1813, a
beetroot sugar industry sprang up all over France,
Germany and Austria, capable of supplying the wants of
Eurojie, and the high price of sugar, due to the “Conti-
nental System” of protection, made the industry highly
profitable, but the abdication of Napoleon in 1814, the
consequent abolition of the “Continental System,” and
the admission of cheaj:) Colonial cane sugar, closed nearly
all of the newly-opened factories, and paralyzed the
whole beetroot sugar industry.
Yet the beet sugar industry continued to expand in
Europe and extended to Russia, the quality of beet
improved and the process of manufacture became more
perfect, and the industry was maintained by heavy pro-
tective duties, or helped by liberal drawbacks or export
premiums, until the Exchequer felt the loss of revenue.
In 1843 the French Government equalized the
import and excise duties, an act so detrimental to the
beet industry that it would have been utterly ruined had
not the sugar-cane production been partly crippled by
the abolition of slavery. Lord Glenville’s Bill of 1807
prohibited the further importation of slaves in British
territory, and on August 1, 1834, the entire system of
slavery in the British colonies and possessions was
absolutely abolished. That was the ever memorable
occasion when Britain paid the owners of the liberated
slaves a sum of twenty millions as an indemnity. Of this
sum sixteen and a half millions went to the West Indian
colonies, and three and a half millions to the Cape and
Mauritius. The production of cane sugar where the slaves
were liberated fell 50 per cent., as in many cases they
lefused to work and left the plantations in great num-
bers. Then Britain put an import duty on sugar from
countries where it was grown by slaves, but this was first
i educed and finally abolished in 1848, the year in which
slavery was abolished by the French in all their colonies


during the Second Republic. In the Dutch West Indian
colonies slavery was abolished in 1863, in Porto Rico in
1873, in St. Thomas in 1876, and in Cuba in 1880.
The United States also abolished slavery, and that
abolition of slaves was a turning point in the history
of sugar, as the labour to take the place of the slaves,
either Chinese, free negroes, or Indian coolies, was too
expensive or otherwise unsatisfactory. The cane sugar in-
dustry had an anxious time, and in the meantime the
beet sugar production was making remarkable progress.
In 1853 cane sugar represented 1,260,400 tons, in
1903 it had grown to 4,164,000 tons, but in the same
period beet sugar rose from 202,800 tons to 5,208,700
tons, or 1,044,700 tons ahead of cane. The beet in-
dustry had progressed by the aid of duties, drawbacks,
and bonuses until both France and Germany were
exporting beet sugar. The excise duty was returned on
all sugar exported, or, rather, the export bounty
amounted to more than the entire inland excise.
Previous to the Great War, Russia was, next to
India, the most extensive producer of sugar in the
world. The old sugar-growing islands of the East and
West Indies have been either stationary in their sugar
production or have declined considerably, while the new
localities, such as Hawaii, Fiji, and Java, have been
increasing. Those are the sugar areas nearest to
Queensland, and it was to save the sugar-growers of
Queensland and New South Wales from the cheap
sugars of Java and Mauritius, and also Amoy and
Swatow, that Australia imposed the sugar protection
duties. Java, which grows and makes sugar with its
own cheap labour, exported largely to England and
America, and ever-increasing quantities of white sugar
to British India. Sugar grown by white labour could
have no chance whatever in the open market with the
Java sugar grown by cheap coloured labour supplied
by a population of 40,000,000 of Javanese living on
an island of 48,688 square miles, which would only
occupy one-thirteenth of the State of Queensland. And
yet that island has a vast area under cane, grown
entirely in Middle and East Java. There are 10,000,000
acres of arable land in Java, and one-tenth of that is
used for cane, though not all under crop at the same
time, and the 185 sugar factories produce about a
million and a half tons .of sugar per annum. Java is
one of the oldest cane growers, cane being seen there
by the Chinese traveller Fah-Heen in 424, and con-
siderable quantities of sugar were made there in the
seventeenth century, when Java was under the control
of the East India Company, until that Company dis-
solved in 1779, when Java passed to Holland, from
Holland to France, but was seized by England in 1811,
and held until 1816, when it was returned to the Nether-
lands. Java sugar industry suffered badly in 1882 to
1884, as the serious fall in the price of sugar caused by
the abnormal increase of cheap beet sugar made the
Java product nearly unsaleable, and a mysterious dis-
ease did great destruction among the cane, but the sugar
industry has steadily progressed from 47,000 tons in
1840 to the million and a half tons of to-day.
The prime cost of producing sugar in Java is given at
£7 10s. to £8 10s. per ton.
The Fiji Islands, discovered by Tasman in 1643 and
visited by Cook in 1773, are our nearest neighbour sugar
competitors. They consist of two large and about 220
small islands, with a total areai of 8,000 square miles. The
two large islands represent 4,250 and 2,500 square miles.
Sugar is grown on the islands of Yiti-Levu and Vanua-
Levu, where the Colonial Sugar Refining Company
started to grow cane in 1880, followed by the Fiji Sugar
Company, and in 1883 there was an export of 5,200 tons.
Labour was a source of trouble, as the Fijians declined
to work. The Comjiany at first obtained kanakas from
Tonga, the Solomons, Erromanga, Malayta, and the
New Hebrides, and finally Calcutta coolies, recruited by
the British Colonial Government under a five years’
indenture with the option of renewal. A sufficient
number of these coolies remain in Fiji to supply the
labour required, and grow cane for the Company on
terms. The Company has four big up-to-date sugar
mills—three on Yiti-Levu and one on Vanua-Levu, and
the export of sugar has grown from 5,200 tons in 1883
to about 85,000 tons in 1918. The bulk of the Fiji
sugar is sent to Auckland, in New Zealand, to be refined
at the Company’s refinery.
The Hawaiian Islands, in the North Pacific, have
made amazing progress in sugar-growing, and yet the
eight islands only contain 6,455 square miles, and cane-
growing is confined to the four largest—Hawaii, Maui,
Aahu, and Kauai—where there are about 230,000 acres
under cane. In 1911 the sugar production rose
to the astonishing quantity of 506,000 tons, so
that the sugar crop of Queensland looks, so far,
rather small by comparison. When Cook landed
on Hawaii, which he called “Owyhee,” on discovery of
the islands in 1778, he found sugar-cane growing there,
but used chiefly for chewing purposes. A hundred
years afterwards, in 1876, Hawaii exported 11,000 tons
to the United States. Reciprocal treaties were made
between Hawaii and the States whereby Hawaii was to
send all her sugar to New York, to be admitted free
of duty, and receive all American goods also free of
duty. This was a mighty stimulus to the sugar industry
and it progressed accordingly. The first sugar factory
was started in 1835, driven by bullocks. In 1861 there
were twenty-two mills—nine driven by steam, twelve by
water, and one by cattle.
In 1893 Hawaii became a Republic and was in-
corporated in the American Union. In that year the
sugar production was 230,000 tons, and in 1901 it had


increased to 360,000 tons, or an advance of 60 per cent.
American capital and energy were responsible for a mag-
nificent system of irrigation being introduced, including
1,500 miles of irrigated canals, 250 reservoirs, and 430
artesian wells, irrigating about 60,000 acres. To-day
there are twenty-six estates in Hawaii itself, ten in
Kauai, ten in Aahu, and seven in Maui. Labour has
always been a difficulty. The planters tried Germans,
Scandinavians, Portuguese from Portugal and the
Azores, Russians from Yladivostock, Chinese, Spani-
ards, Filipinos, and even a lot of negroes. Once
under American laws all indentured labour was for-
bidden and all further immigration of Chinese was
stopped. At present the Japanese supply the principal
part of the labour, and of these there are 85,000 in
the four islands. The Census of 1910 gave about
200,000 as the total population, and of these there
were 45,000 in the capital, Honolulu.
SUGAR-GROWING IN QUEENSLAND.
The history of sugar-growing in Queensland has a
record in the beginning of many failures and much
wasted energy and lost capital. Like all other industries,
the pioneers were the stepping stones over which their
successors walked to success. Those early men paid heavy
penalties for their want of knowledge of soils and canes,
and their want, too often, of sufficient capital, of suitable
machinery, and qualified sugar boilers. With all Queens-
land to choose from, some of them started growing cane
on poor lands with clay sub-soils, and formed small
plantations among the swamps of Pimpama and Nerang
Creek. We may marvel to-day at Captain Hope forming
the plantation of Ormiston at Cleveland, or Raff at
Cabooltute, or scores of others in localities fore-doomed
to failure. No sugar planter of to-day would do other
than laugh at the idea of cane-growing on those or similar
areas. It seems a sad pity that the grand old pioneers of
the industry did not at least start with suitable soil. The
same mistakes were made at the dawn of sugar-growing
at Port Macquarie and the Macleay River.
The first sugar mill in Australia was erected on the
Wilson River, a tributary of the Hastings, in the days
when Port Macquarie was a penal settlement, and it was
worked by convict labour. The manager was a Mr.
Thomas Scott, who afterwards made sugar at Brisbane
Water, near Sydney, and did, much to encourage sugar-
growing in New South Wales. He visited the Clarence
River in 1868 to advise the early cane growers. His
mills and machinery of 1824 on the Wilson were swept
away in a flood, after three years’ work. The first cane
plants grown at Port Macquarie came from Java and
Mauritius, and a tall, very hard, slender cane from
Tahiti. The others were Ribbon, Black Java, and Bour-
bon canes, the latter a soft, low-density cane with very
few leaves. It brought disaster to those who trusted to
it in Queensland, where it rusted badly and was finally
exterminated in the seventies. The first sugar-cane in
Queensland came from plants brought to Moreton Bay
in 1828 by Charles Fraser, the New South Wales Govern-
ment Botanist, who came up chiefly to lay off and start
a Botanic Garden on the site of the jmesent Brisbane
Gardens. The tall, hardy Tahitian cane was grown as a
hedge, the stools being very dense, and sufficient to
stop cattle or horses. The Quaker missionaries, Back-
house and Walker, saw this sugar-cane hedge in 1836.
But cane was apparently allowed to die out, and in 1862
Captain Hope had to import plants from Java to start
his plantation near Cleveland, twenty-five miles from
Brisbane, though there was some cane then growing in
the Botanic Gardens from plants brought there from Port
Macquarie in 1856, when Walter Hill was curator. He
was the first who held that position.
From a few of these canes, John Buhot, a planter
from Barbados, made the first cane sugar ever granulated
in Queensland. He crushed the canes with a lever, and
boiled the juice in a saucepan. And this was done about
midnight, in the Botanic Gardens, with only Buhot and
Walter Hill present. No one else was allowed to witness
that tremendous experiment, which was to settle the
mighty problem whether the juice of Queensland-grown
cane would granulate. As if there could be any difference
between cane grown here, or in Java, or the AVest Indies
or anywhere els©! But sugar-growing has travelled a
long way since that night of April 25, 1862, when
Buhot’s historic saucepan represented a combined tache
and tiiple-effet and vacuum pan. Captain Hope
proceeded with his planting at Ormiston, and in 1863
had his mill erected, with a flat pan battery and a tache,
finishing in a AVetzel pan, and on September 9, 1864, he
made his first ton of sugar —the first ton sold publicly
in Brisbane is recorded as January 6, 1866. The State
Parliament mad© a grant of 2,500 acres of land to Cap-
tain Hope in recognition of what he had done in estab-
lishing the industry.
It may be mentioned here that a Frenchman, M.
Thozet, even in 1860, was growing experimental plots of
cotton, sugar, tobacco, rice, and arrowroot at Rock-
hampton. In that year, 1860, Dr. Hobbs, afterwards
M.L.C., said, before a committee of immigration: “A
man who had been some time in Jamaica came out in the
same ship with me to start a sugar company in Queens-
land. After waiting some months, he got a piece of land
surveyed, and, though it was covered with dense scrub,
the Government fixed 30s. to 40s. per acre as the price.”
1 hat was the locality now known as ( Boggo,” on the
border of South Brisbane, certainly a remarkable
spot on which to start a sugar plantation. Several lead-
ing Sydney men were to take shares, including Charles
Kemp, of the Herald.


BADILA CANE.


Captain Hope’s success at Ormiston gave a start to
sugar-growing in the south. In 1865 George Raff and
Captain Whish started estates on the Caboolture, and
then came White, and Robinson and Shelley on the
Coomera; Witty and Colin Munro on the Albert, Green-
side at Pimpama, Robert Muir and Mort Holland and
Miskin on Nerang Creek, the latter opposite where the
old Manchester Cotton Company grew cotton in the days
when Price was manager. Others started in all sorts of
places, mostly small mills, from half a ton to a ton per
day, some with wooden rollers and horse power, and
batteries of round cast-iron pots, finishing in the last pan
over the fire, called the tache. In this terribly wasteful
process from a fourth to even a third of the sugar was
lost, but there was a compensation in the high price.
Good yellow open pan sugar sold from £36 to £4O, and
even second sugar sold up to £25 and £3O. The same
firsts to-day would be worth about £2O, and no small mill
could possibly pay at present prices. One of the largest
yields of the early days is credited to the Logan, where
in 1872 six and a half acres of Ribbon cane gave twenty-
seven tons of sugar. At first there were no centrifugals,
and the sugar and molasses were separated in long
triangular- shaped drainage boxes, perforated with small
augur or gimlet holes. The advent of the centrifugal
was a great improvement, and the finishing in the
tache was superseded by three steam pans, the Bauer
pan, Wetzel and Gadsden pans. They did splendid work
in their time, but they were primitive appliances, and
became obsolete with the advent of the triple effet and
the vacuum pan, apparently the limit in concentration
and evaporation.
Take this typical case of pioneer sugar-growing at
Mackay. On June 1, 1865, John Spiller planted the
first cane at Mackay, on the north side of the river. He
had been to Java to learn sugar-growing and manufacture
on the estate of Herr Modeman, near Sourabaya. Spiller
brought 30,000 plants to Melbourne, but the long
journey perished the most of them, and he left them all
with Captain Hope at Cleveland, near Brisbane. On
the Pioneer River he lived in a grass humpy, and had his
first cane plants in an enclosure about forty yards square.
In 1866 he let T. H. Fitz-GeralcL have part of the crop
due from Captain Hope, and Fitz-Gerald also got a lot
of plants from Captain Whish, at Redland Bay. Next
year there were plants for extended operations. At the
end of June, 1867, Spiller erected a wooden horse mill
and made the first Mackay sugar in an ordinary boiler.
Then John Ewen Davidson went into partnership with
Fitz-Gerald, and erected the first iron mill, the Alexan-
dra, in 1868, crushed the first cane on September 28, and
finished with 110 tons of sugar on November 18. That
was the successful start of sugar-growing in Mackay
The season of 1875 brought a phenomenally heavy
rainfall. In many districts over 100 inches were regis-
tered. A disease known as “rust” resulted, and
threatened those who had invested money in the business
with ruin. The origin of the trouble was discovered to
be lack of proper drainage of the ground, insufficient
cultivation, and the use of a soft variety of cane. The
difficulties were thus of a nature which might be overcome
in the light of experience. Harder varieties of cane were
used, and confidence in the future of the industry was
restored. The financial institutions, to which investors
in sugar-growing and crushing were heavily indebted,
were prepared again to advance money on sugar farms
and mills, and the old rate of progress was resumed.
According to Loyau’s “History of Maryborough,”
there were in 1876 fifteen sugar and juice mills in the
Maryborough district. These were as follows:—Antigua
(Mr. A. H. Brown), output of raw sugar 300 tons, area
of plantation 400 acres; Alford (Messrs. Farquhar and
Dunne), area under cane 500 acres; Central (Mr. Gib-
son), 300 acres; Eaton Vale (Mr. John Eaton), 300
acres of cane; Good Hope (Messrs. Graham and Nixon),
near Tiaro; Kirkcubbin (Messrs. Powers and Lyons),
area of plantation 3,000 acres, Mr. (now Sir) A. S.
Cowley, manager; lindah (Ramsay Bros.), also distillery,
300 acres of cane; Irrawarra (Mr. F. T. Nixon), an out-
station of Yengarie mill, to which juice was conveyed in
pipes, area of plantation 2,000 acres; Maryborough
Sugar Co.’s Estate, area of plantation 1,200 acres;
Magnolia, on Tinana Creek, area of plantation, 4,000
acies, Yerra Yerra (portion of Yengarie), area of planta-
tion 1,200 acres; Yengarie (Messrs. Tooth and Cran),
output 5,000 tons of raw sugar; Nerade, on Tinana
Creek (Mr. H. Monckton), area of plantation 1,000
acres; Bingera, in the Bundaberg district (Messrs
Gibson and Howes); Maryborough Factory, Limited,
output 7,413 tons of raw sugar. The Millaquin
Refinery was also in full swing at this period.
In the same year there were 3,224 acres growing
sugar in the Maryborough district, whilst the output of
raw sugar was 3,412 tons, and the quantity of molasses
produced was 178,274 gallons.
The Mackay and the Hartfert and Johnstone Rivers
districts were the first localities in the Northern Division
of the State to attract the attention of sugar growers,
and the industry was well established in these regions in
the early seventies. In 1872, 3,436 acres were under cane
in the Mackay district. In 1877 the area had increased to
5,768 acres; whilst 7,643 tons of raw sugar were dealt
with then by the local mills. Besides those already
mentioned, the following names remain as among the
pioneers of the industry in the area about Mackay:
McCready, A. McClanachan, Finch-Hatton, Brandon,
Rawson, E. M. Long, P age t Bros., Sir John Bennett

ties were the Black Java, Djong-Djong, Malabar, two
varieties of Ribbon, and the Bourbon. The Bourbon was
the first infected by rust, followed in a much milder
form by the Black Java, which was one of the best of the
ratooning canes.
but did not prove a success. Very pathetic, and occasion-
ally tragical, is the history of the pioneers of sugar-grow-
ing in Queensland and New South Wales, and nearly all
the failures and disappointments and financial disasters
arose from want of knowledge and experience. Sugar-
growing progressed rapidly from 1867, was checked for a

Among the small mills of the early days was one at
Bulimba, owned by the Gibson Brothers, one of whom,
the M.L.C., is the honoured proprietor of Bingera to-day.
Berry had a small mill at Oxley Creek, Dart had one at
the present St. Lucia Estate, and Dr. Waugh had Pearl-
well plantation, near the present Yeerongpilly, managed
time by disease in the Bourbon canes, wavered for a few
years, reached a zenith from 1879 to 1882, and was sud-
denly checked again by the three years’ notice of the
stoppage of kanaka labour, a decision which Parliament
reversed, and the result was an immediate recovery from
north to south. Reports of first-class sugar lands sent

by John Buhot. In 1872 a West Indian named Poochee,
erected a small mill at Walloon, and in 1874 John
Pettigrew, of Ipswich, erected a small mill a few miles
from that town, on the Upper Brisbane. A floating sugar
mill, the "Walrus,” was tried on the Brisbane River,
calling at the growers’ wharves and crushing the cane,
planters first to the valley of the Mary and the Marybor-
ough district, and north to the Burnett, Mackay country,
the Bui dekin, Herbert, Johnstone, Cairns, and Bloom-
field, places where there were vast areas of sugar country
superior to anything in South-eastern Queensland.
Chen came the day of large mills, individual


proprietors, and companies witli plenty of capital, great
improvements in the machinery, and the old methods
relegated to the past. Finally came the separation of
grower and manufacturer, first started on the Clarence
River by the C.S.R. Company, when they erected their
first mill there at Southgate, and the same year the
Belmore Sugar Company started the Belmore mill at
Ulmarra, opened by the Earl of Belmore in 1872. The
shares were chiefly taken up by the farmers. By reason
of the very crude machinery and bad management and
want of competent boilers, the mill was a total failure,
being finally sold out and dismantled. Even the cautious
and experienced C.S.R. Company made some serious mis-
takes with their first mill at Southgate, such as sending
the molasses and sugar to Sydney in one mass, without
drainage or centrifugal, with rather surprising results.
The C.S.R. Company had no cane of its own, and relied
entirely on what it could purchase from the farmers, to
whom it paid ten shillings per ton delivered on the river
bank, the Company sending gangs of men to do the
cutting, and punts to take it to the mills. The Company
erected two more mills on the lower part of the river, one
on Harwood Island, and one on Chatsworth Island, the
first mill at Southgate being pulled down and removed.
Unfortunately for themselves, a number of cane
growers evolved the idea that the Company was not
paying them a fair price for their cane, and that they
could do much better by erecting their own mills. So
there were thirty-two small mills erected on the Clarence
and eighteen on the Richmond River, where the C.S.R.
Company had a large mill at the Broadwater. All these
small mills gradually disappeared, some having ruined
their owners, and very few were even partly successful.
The cane growers then returned to the Company, and it
is quite certain that the farmers of the Clarence and
Richmond prospered on even the price of ten shillings
per ton, and the craze for small mills disappeared.
Finally the Company erected a large mill at Condong, on
the Tweed River, and extended their operations to
Queensland, at Childers, Mackay, the Herbert, John-
stone, and Cairns. The only small mill on the Tweed
River, owned by John Robb at Cudgen, had gone, and
all the small mills in Queensland, with the exception of
three or four at Pimpama and the Logan, had also dis-
appeared. The separation of the grower and the manu-
facturer had finally settled the 1 problem of sugar-growing
on a permanent basis.
Sugar-growing extended from Nerang Creek, in the
south, to the Bloomfield River, near Cooktown, where
Bauer formed the Villele plantation in 1884, but the site
was badly chosen, and after a few unsuccessful seasons
the mill was removed. Queensland is the great sugar-
growing State of Australia, and so far only a fraction of
our valuable sugar land is under cane. Queensland could
not only supply all Australia, but have a vast surplus
available for export. Only a portion of the rich lands at
Mackay, the Burdekin, Herbert, Johnstone, and Russell
are under cane. There are at least ten thousand acres
of untouched rich scrub land on the Daintree, and some
thousands of acres on Bailey Creek, the river next to the
Daintree. If necessary, there is upwards of a million
acres of rich red basaltic scrub soil on the Atherton
Tableland fit to grow sugar-cane in perfection. There
are also small and large areas of scrub sugar lands on all
the east coast creeks and rivers, north to Cape York.
Even at the Cape there is a big belt of rich scrub land
between Somerset and the Jardine River. The sugar-
growing capacity of Northern Queensland is not measure-
able. There is still an extensive area of untouched sugar
country between Mackay and the Proserpine. Sugar-
cane flourishes on widely different soils. It grows on the
light loamy soils of open forest country, the rich humus
soil of the scrubs, the alluvium of river deltas, such as
the Burdekin, Herbert, and Pioneer Rivers, and in the
red basalt of scrubs like the Rosewood, Isis, and Woon-
garra, and astonishing yields in both ratoons and stand-
over cane have been obtained from all classes of soils.
The evolution of sugar-growing in Queensland is a
remarkable story. From Buhot’s historic pound of sugar
in the saucepan of 1862, and Captain Hope’s first ton in
1864, the industry expanded, until in 1886 we supplied
ourselves, and had a surplus for export to the value of
£858,000, whilst in 1921 there were 184,513 acres under
cane, from which 2,287,416 tons of sugar-cane were har-
vested for a return of 282,198 tons of raw sugar repre-
senting a value of £8,560,006, and the forty mills and
two refineries employed over 6,000 hands, and more than
£4,000,000 was paid in wages.
Sugar mills extended from Nerang Creek to the
Mossman River, over a coastline of a thousand miles.
There are two refineries, one at Brisbane, owned by the
C.S.R. Company, and the Millaquin Refinery, at East
Bundaberg. The C.S.R. Company has the following
mills in Queensland, the Childers, Goondi, Hambledon,
Macnade, and Victoria, and there are six Central Mills,
the Babinda, South Johnstone, Bauple, Proserpine, Gin
Gin, and Nerang, which were built by the Government,
with money advanced on the security of the cane-
growers lands, and are still under direct Government
control. The other five Government-built mills, the
Mossman, Mulgrave, Plane Creek, Isis, and Moreton,
have so far been successful as to have control of their own
affairs. Of the C.S.R. mills, Macnade and Hambledon
were private mills, bought by the Company. The Vic-
toria was the first in 1883, and the last, the Childers,
in 189,). The Babinda and South Johnstone mills, the
latest, are very complete and fitted with the most modem


machinery. In the crushing, which ended on February 12,
1917, the Babinda mill disposed of 154,630 tons of cane
for 14,618 tons of sugar, an Australian record. Rain fell
for nearly six months, and the rainfall for the year was
203 inches, the highest in Australia.
The first sugar planters in Mackay were Spider and
h itz-Gerald, the first mills, Alexandra, Meadowlands,
Pioneer, Pleystowe, Nebia, Dumbleton, Foulden, and
Cassada. Mr. T. H. Fitz-Gerald, who had the first plan-
tation in Mackay, had also the first on the Johnstone
River, where he started the Tnnisfail Estate in 1881, This
—the Bloomfield—merely a creek, about twenty-five
miles south of Cooktown, and close to Mt. Finlayson. The
first planters and mill-owners on the Herbert were the
brothers Haig, McKenzie, Neames, Atkinson, and Wood
Brothers and Boyd. The first mills on the Burdekin
were those of Colin Munro (Drynie), Drysdale Brothers
(Pioneer), and Young and McKenzie (Kalamia and
Airdmillan).
In 1885 the Griffith Ministry voted £50,000 to start
the Central Mill system, which was extended by sub-
sequent Governments, until finally eleven mills were

name is now borne by the township on the Johnstone
River, where it replaced the first name of Geraldton,
which was liable to confusion with Geraldton in West
Australia. The second planters at Cairns were Swallow
and Derham, who took up the Hambledon Estate in
1881, ten miles from Cairns. Next to them came J. B.
Loridan and the Pyramid Sugar Company on the Upper
Mulgrave. The Chinese “Hop Wah” mill was the first.
Bauer, a planter from the Logan, started the Bloomfield
River Sugar Company with Villele Plantation, which has
long since been abandoned. It was on a very small river
erected, the Nerang, More ton, Bauple, Isis, Gin Gin,
Plane Creek, Mossman, Mulgrave, South Johnstone,
Proserpine and Babinda. The first sura of £50,000 was
divided between the North Eton and Racecourse mills at
Mackay. These Central Mills, with two' exceptions, have
been splendid successes, and are fine testimonials to the
far-seeing men who realized the possibilities of such a
system, if once established and wisely administered.
Nowhere in Australia, and possibly not in the world, is
there any natural industry that pays such wages to those
employed.


KANAKA LABOUR.
No history of sugar would be complete without an
account of the kanaka labour, which meant so much to
the sugar growers of the sixties and seventies, and which
left a bar sinister across the political records of Queens-
land. When Robert Towns started cotton-growing on
Townsvale plantation on the Logan River in 1863, there
was a scarcity of white labour, and a serious doubt of the
industry being able to pay white men’s wages. So Towns
decided to import a lot of Polynesians from the South Sea
Islands, and he engaged a man named Ross Lewin to take
charge of the undertaking. Lewin had been years among
some of the islands and knew the islanders, their customs
and language, and he got the first sixty kanakas from
the islands of Tanna, Malioolo, Erromanga, and Sand-
wich. Towns gave Lewin two documents, one an agree-
ment to pay the islanders ten shillings per month, provide
good food, good camps, and return to their islands in
twelve months. The other was addressed to any mission,
explaining the object of Lewin’s visit and offering a
guarantee that the recruits would be properly cared for.
It is quite certain that those pioneer kanakas were care-
fully recruited and honestly cared for on the voyage. It
is equally certain that they were well fed and housed on
the plantation on the Logan. They slept in a large
weatherboard building, roofed with grass. It was sixty
by forty feet, in two rooms with bunks and blankets and
a wide verandah; but after a few months the men pre-
ferred to have separate liuts for the different tribes.
In 1864 the Logan grew 38,700 lb. of cotton, and in
1866 it increased to 186,630 lb., or 612 bales of clean
cotton, of which 267 bales came off Townsvale plantation.
In 1867 there came unpleasant reports from the islands
regarding the non-return of kanakas who had gone to
Queensland and Fiji, and were kept three years instead
of one, and Captain Luce of H.M.S. “Esk,” reported in
April the loss of several ships and the murder of a number
of Europeans. An enquiry showed that up to April,
1867, there had been 382 men recruited for Queensland
and seventy-eight returned. A number of the kanakas
preferred to remain for two or three years instead of
going back. Governor Sir George Bowen went to the
Logan and inspected 160 islanders on Townsvale planta-
tion, all well fed and contented, most of them having
been engaged for three years. He was surprised to find
a steam plough at work there, under the direction of an
English engineer. Daily prizes were given to the champion
cotton-pickers, the prizes being knives, belts, buckles,
beads, and tobacco. In 1868 Governor Belmore, of New
South Wales, reported complaints against the recruiting
on the islands, and in February of that year he received
a petition, signed by eight missionaries, praying for an
enquiry into the manner in which natives were being
recruited in the New Hebrides. This petition contained
serious charges, and a unanimous opinion that the system
of obtaining Polynesian labour recalled the worst days of
the slave trade. The answer to these charges was the
passing by the Queensland Parliament of an Act,
imposing stringent conditions and regulations, and the
following scale of supplies: Beef or mutton (or 2 lb.
of fish), 1 lb.; bread or flour, 1 lb.; molasses or sugar,
5 oz.; vegetables, rice, or maize meal, 2 oz.; salt, 2 oz.;
soap, 4 oz.; tobacco, \\ oz.
Those islanders brought with them from their sea-
girt homes, a lot of tara plants (Colocasia Macrorhha),
and grew them on the Logan, at Nerang, Mary-
borough, Mackay and the Herbert. The kanakas of the
first years were all picked men, and those from Tanna
especially, were described as “splendid looking fellows,
tall, muscular, and wonderfully strong.” This quality
was not maintained in after years. The best men did not
return to Queensland, and the recruiting vessels had to
take what they could get. When the captains or recruit-
ing agent made terms with the chiefs, those astute
warriors were careful not to send the best men. They
wanted their picked fighting men at home.
In August, 1863, nearly four years after the estab-
lishment of responsible government, Captain Robert
Towns landed from the schooner “Don Juan” the first
consignment of kanakas, who played so large a part in
subsequent years in the development of the sugar
industry. Originally imported here for the purpose of
cotton cultivation in the Logan district, it was not long
before Captain, the Honourable Louis Hope, M.L.C.,
followed suit, and applied this class of labour to sugar-
cane cultivation at Cleveland, and from this small begin-
ning the practice of indenting Polynesian labour grew
into a vast and flourishing system, until the sugar lands
of the North practically produced their crops wholly by
its aid. The advent of this, perhaps, the least objection-
able class of black labour, in time led, as it undoubtedly
did, to the division of political parties, to bitter political
strife, to acute personal differences among our leading
politicians, to numerous social evils of varying kinds, and
to the shocking tragedy of murder, rapine, kidnapping,
and all the violence attendant upon all forms of black
slavery. So large a part did this trade play in legisla-
tion and administration, extending over a long period of
years, that the subject could not be overlooked in the
political history of the State. The whole trade was a
blight upon our social and political life, yet the kanaka
was a peaceable, law-abiding, kindly disposed savage,
responsive to any act of benevolence, suited to the work
for which he was imported, moderately industrious,
faithful to those who gained his confidence, and with
no particular ambitions in regard to inter-marriage with
the white race. That was the early kanaka. His more
modern prototype was often under the influence of


“civilization,” a truculent savage, addicted to gambling,
and frequently to drink—until in some of our northern
coastal towns, he was becoming so great a social menace,
that the advent of Federation, under whose laws he
was returned to his native land, was, if for no- other
reason, an undisguised blessing.
Among the earlier experimenters in Polynesian
labour was the Acclimatization Society at Bowen Park,
opposite the General Hospital. There a gang of twelve or
more kanakas were continuously employed for some
years. Doubtless, it was the acute shortage of labour ir
undisguieedly hoisted the banner of "The Slave Trade,’’
and from 1863 onwards until the final disappearance of
our dark-skinned brother, under Federal law, there were
those who never neglected the viewpoint of a British
colony endeavouring to solve its economic problems by
the importation of labour obtained under doubtful con-
ditions and on extremely cheap terms. When, however,
we find the movement endorsed by our first Governor
Sir George Bowen, and acclaimed as a means by which
Queensland might exalt itself into an immensely wealthy
State, there is no wonder that the founders of the black

the early sixties, which gave rise to the idea of introduc-
ing island labour. In those days, there were visions of
Queensland becoming a great cotton-growing country,
and the prospect of successful cotton-growing without
plentiful and cheap labour was not over bright. The
experiment later on of Louis Hope, with sugar-growing,
gave further impetus to the movement, which, in spite
of opposition at the early stages, attained larger and
and still greater dimensions. It is a significant fact that
the opposition to the importation of Pacific Islanders
labour trade were encouraged to redouble their efforts,
and by increased immigration of the black man root him
more firmly in Northern Australia, and make his final
elimination more difficult. Between 1863 and 1868
there was a steady flow both inwards and outwards of
this class of labour, undertaken apparently with the full
sanction of the Government, though, strange as it may
seem, there was no attempt whatever either to regulate
recruiting, or in any way to control the employers of
Polynesians.


It was in the year 1868 that the Queensland Parlia-
ment first legislated upon this important phase of our
social life, but only after repeated attempts to call public
attention to the growing abuses of the trade. There was
more than a grave suspicion that the earlier years of this
trade in human beings were years of tragedy to the
subject races, and that a large proportion of our coloured
labour was brought here under evil circumstances. On
March 4, 1868, “An Act to Regulate and Control the
Introduction and Treatment of Polynesian Labourers”
was passed and assented to, the preamble of which
declared :
“Whereas many persons have deemed it desirable
“and necessary in order to enable them to carry out
“their operations in tropical and semi-tropical agri-
culture to introduce to the colony Polynesian
“labourers; And whereas it is necessary for the pre-
vention of abuses and for securing the labourers
“proper treatment and protection as well as for secur-
ing to the employer the due fulfilment by the
“immigrant of his agreement that an Act should be
“passed for the control of such immigration.”
This Act provided for the importation of labour
under regulations, the appointment of inspectors, the
issuing of licences to import, with a guarantee to return
the labourer to his home on the expiration of his agree-
ment. Masters of labour vessels were under a bond to
comply with imperative regulations regarding the
number carried on any vessel, their rationing, non-supply
of intoxicants, and other matters. Uncomfortable
suggestions were being made at this time in regard to
the details of the traffic; much correspondence appeared
in the press on the subject, and both the local and
Imperial Parliaments were approached with a view to
stopping the trade entirely, or severely controlling it. It
can readily be understood how the abuses connected with
such a trade might naturally become the battle-cry of a
political party. Indeed, that is just what they did
become. From 1859 to 1868 the real and only rulers of
the country were the planters and squatters, and the
assertion of their self-interests became so aggressively
pronounced, that there sprang up a well-organised
opposition, with “Anti-Black Labour” as its rallying cry.
That the agitation against this class of labour had
assumed large proportions, and that there were crying
evils associated with it, is made quite evident by the
fact that on June 27, 1872, an Imperial Act was assented
to, having for its object “The Prevention and Punish-
ment of Criminal Outrages upon Natives of the Islands
in the Pacific Ocean.” There was no disguise about
this law, for it was entitled snortly, “The Kidnapping
Act of 1872,” and for the offence of kidnapping the
colonial courts were authorised to impose “the highest
punishment, other than capital punishment, awarded for
any felony by the law of the colony in which such
offender shall be tried.” This Act was amended in
August, 1875, under the title of “The Pacific Islanders
Protection Act,” and further drastic provisions were
enacted, which one would have thought deterrent enough
for all practical purposes. Locally, the importation of
islanders into Queensland was governed under the 1868
law up to 1880, when Thomas Mcllwraith, having come
into office for the first time, passed in the latter year a
law which repealed the Act of 1868, re-enacted a number
of its provisions with important alterations, and made
the departure of appointing “Government Agents’’ to
accompany each recruiting vessel to the islands. The
Polynesian Labourers Act Amendment Bills, intro-
duced by Miles and Douglas in 1877 and 1878 respec-
tively, had only reached their second reading stage, and
in the meantime there had been continuous agitations,
either for repression or regulation of the traffic. In those
years, Samuel Griffith, who afterwards took so prominent
a part in the crusade against the trade, and black labour
employers, was a member of the Douglas Ministry as
Attorney-General. Prior to the introduction of the
above-mentioned Bills by Miles and Douglas, there had
been a select committee appointed by the Legislative
Assembly in 1876 to inquire into “the general question
of Polynesian Labour.”
Turn now to the 1880 Act. The age of recruits was
limited. Masters of vessels were under a heavy bond to
return the islanders to their proper islands; medical
comforts were provided for the immigrants; the ration
and dress allowance was increased; the number of
passengers was limited; wages were protected; store
accounts were not to be deducted from wages; the care
and treatment of the sick were stringently provided for;
employers had to maintain hospitals; and licences to
employ islanders were only to be granted to those engaged
in tropical or semi-tropical agriculture, defined to mean
the cultivation of sugar-cane, cotton, tea, coffee, rice,
spices, or other tropical or semi-tropical productions, or
fruits. A perusal of this Act does not convey the
impression that the Government of Queensland in 1880
was a consenting party to a slave trade, nor does any sane
person believe that it was. In 1884, during the Griffith
regime, the Pacific Island Labourers Act was amended.
‘ Tropical or semi-tropical agriculture” was defined as
meaning, field work in connection with the cultivation
of sugar-cane, cotton, tea, coffee, rice, spices, or other
tropical or semi-tropical productions or fruits, and did
not include the business of engineers, engine-drivers,
engine-fitters, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, farriers, sugar
boilers, carpenters, sawyers, splitters, fencers, bullock-
drivers or mechanics, grooms or coachmen, horse driving
or carting (except in field work) or domestic or house-
hold service.


Shortly before the Griffith Government came into
office the attention of recruiters had been directed to New
Guinea, and the two islands of New Britain and New
Ireland, lying north-west of New Guinea, as well as some
of the smaller islands in the vicinity. It was not a
suitable recruiting ground, for the natives in many
instances were unhealthy, undesirable as labourers, and
the mortality amongst them was very great. Early in
1884 recruiting was being carried on in the Louisiade
Group, though the New Guinea mainland at that time
had not been exploited. Recruiting at this period had
been prohibited in New Britain and New Ireland, and
in June, 1884, the prohibition was extended to the New
Guinea mainland. In the meantime, however, informa-
tion gradually began to leak out with regard to the trans-
actions of those in charge of certain vessels, which left
the Queensland coast during 1884. Those vessels were
the “Hopeful,” “Ceara,” “Lizzie,” “Sybil,” “Forest
King,” and “Heath.” The Government appointed a
commission to investigate the charges made, and they
carried out their inquiries on the spot, in addition to
examining 500 islanders in Queensland, and the conclu-
sion of the commissioners was that none of the islanders
understood the nature of their engagements. The lament-
able occurrences in connection with the voyages of the
“Hopeful” were the subject of investigation by the
supreme court, and the condign punishment of death
sentences and capital punishment was meted out to
offenders proved guilty of murder and kidnapping. The
capital sentences were not carried out. The foregoing
leads up shortly to the legislation of 1885. The islanders
having been forcibly brought here, every instinct of
humanity dictated that they should be set free and re-
turned to their homes. With this object in view Samuel
Griffith passed in August, 1885, “An Act to Make Pro-
vision for the Assessment and Payment of Compensa-
tion to certain Employers of Pacific Island Labourers,
who have been returned to their native islands by order
of the Governor-in-Council.”
Under this Act a district court judge with two
assessors investigated the claims for compensation; there
were strict limitations put upon the nature of the claims
that could be made, and on the certificate of the judge
compensation was payable out of any moneys appro-
priated by Parliament for that purpose. But a very
much more important Act relating to Pacific Island
labour was passed by Samuel Griffith in November, 1885.
The eleventh and last section of this Act provided :
“After the thirty-first day of December, One
“thousand eight hundred and ninety, no licence to
“introduce Islanders shall be granted.”
There were other important amendments of the 1880
to 1884 Acts increasing the capitation fee to be paid by
employers to £3, increasing the hospital capitation fee to
£l, and dealing with the money of deceased islanders.
Furthermore, under the Act of 1884, certain exemptions
had been granted to islanders who had been resident in
the State for a continuous period of five years, and this
was continued; but the day had come when, after
twenty-one years of Polynesian immigration, Parliament
definitely decided that it would have no more of a
trade that had given rise to scandals without end, and
had been the source of more political, party and personal
differences, than any other subject that had cropped up
during our political history. Five years was a good
long notice to give the planter, and would easily have
enabled him to adjust his requirements to the new con-
ditions. There was naturally bitter controversy over the
proposed abolition, but it had been definitely agreed
upon as a part of the State policy, and it was futile to
try to resist the great political sweep of the country,
which Samuel Griffith had made at so recent a date. Who
could have foretold, even with intimate knowledge of the
great fighting qualities of the planter class, that this
momentous decision, would, within a few short years, be
reversed ? The importation of kanakas had to cease in
December, 1890, but the islanders brought in up to that
date would be on a three-years’ engagement, and thus
eight full years were given in which those interested in
the sugar industry could make arrangements for a
suitable substitute. The Pacific Island Labourers Acts,
1880 to 1885, were amended again in 1886 by Samuel
Griffith, who was still in office. The definition of “Pacific
Islander” was amended to include a “native not of
European extraction, of any island in the Pacific Ocean,
which was not on the eighteenth day of November One
thousand eight hundred and eighty, within Her
Majesty’s Dominions, or within the jurisdiction of any
civilized power.” That amendment was necessary, because
of the acquisition of territory in the Pacific by civilized
powers, the intention being that the islanders should
come within the protection of the law.
The next move in the history of this question came
in 1892. Two Governments, led by Thomas Mcllwraith
and B. D. Morehead respectively, had intervened
between June, 1888, and August, 1890, at which latter
date Samuel Griffith again came into power, in
combination with his one-time political foe, Thomas
Mcllwraith. Many things had happened between
those dates; many influences had been at work,
and in April, 1892, Samuel Griffith came to Parliament
with, and passed a proposal to repeal the provision of the
1885 Act putting an end to the importation of Pacific
Islanders. When one looks back and thinks of how he
attained the very pinnacle of his political fame largely
by means of the high stand he took in his effort to pre-
vent the good name of Queensland being besmirched by
the sordid surroundings of a doubtful trade, one wonders

what malign influences were brought to bear to make such
a man recant such great ideals, after spending the best
years of his political life in cleansing an Augean stable.
No wonder, that between the years 1892 and 1901 Par-
liament preserved an ominous silence in regard to the
question of Polynesian labour. It had hurt itself by its
astounding inconsistency and want of continuity of pur-
pose, and when the first Commonwealth Government
came into power and the islanders were uncere-
moniously bundled out of Queensland, exemption
being given to those who were exempted under
Section 11 of the Queensland Act 47, Vic. No. 12, on the
ground of continuous residence for not less than five
years, before the first day of September One thousand
eight hundred and eighty-four, there was no very pro-
found regret that from Queensland at least had been
removed for ever a fertile source of political contention,
and an unattractive phase of the Queensland labour
system in sugar-growing.
LEGISLATION.
No single Australian industry has received so much
attention from the National and State Legislatures as
has sugar-growing. This has been largely due to the
determination of the people to preserve the racial purity
of the Continent, and therefore to prohibit the further
importation and employment of coloured aliens for
work on the canefields and at the mills. This necessi-
tated the payment of a bounty to growers employing
white labour, and the exclusion of cheaply produced
foreign sugar. On the other hand, the consummation of
Federation had opened the markets of the other States to
the Queensland producers, and undoubtedly sugar-growing
was one of the industries to benefit immediately and
greatly from the Federal Constitution. The following is
a list of the various Acts passed to deal with the perplex-
ing labour problems surrounding the sugar business and
with other phases of that interest ;
*The proclamation in regard to the repeal of these Acts
was issued on July 26, 1913.
There was never at any time any doubt about the
temper of the people in regard to the employment of
cheap coloured labour, and one of the earliest matters to
be dealt with by the first National Parliament was that
of the kanakas being used on the canefields. In 1901
both Houses passed an Act providing that no Pacific
Islander should enter Australia after March, 1904, and
that none should enter before that date except under
special licence provided for in the Act, and that no
agreement involving the employment in Australia of
coloured labour should remain in force after 1904. The
Act also stipulated for the deportation of kanakas to
their homes. The greater number of the blacks were
sent out of the Commonwealth, but in 1906 the Pacific
Island Labourers Act was passed by the National Legis-
lature, and some of the blacks have been permitted to
remain, something like 2,000 of them now being in
Queensland still engaged in cane-growing, some having
holdings of their own.
Before the creation of the Commonwealth Queens-
land sugar was subject to a duty of £6 per ton on entry
into Victoria and £3 per ton on entry into New South
Wales or South Australia. The consummation of
Federation abolished all such fiscal imposts as between
State and State, and in 1902 the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment passed the Excise Tariff Act, which gave to the
sugar growers of Queensland a protective duty of £6 per
ton against all foreign cane sugar. The same measure
also provided for an excise of £3 per ton to be collected
on locally-grown sugar, but of this amount a rebate of
£2 per ton was allowed on sugar grown by white labour.
The rebate on the excise was known as the sugar bounty.
The Federal Parliament in 1903 passed the Sugar
Rebate Abolition Act and the Sugar Bounty Act. The
amounts respectively of the excise and rebate were not
altered. Two years later another Bounty Act and Excise
Tariff Act were adopted. The Bounty Act raised the
bounty tax from 4s. to 6s. per ton on cane yielding not
less than 10 per cent, of commercial sugar. Under
this legislation the excise was increased, as from 1907,
to £4 per ton. The Excise (Sugar) Act of 1910 provided
for the continuance indefinitely of the existing excise on
locally-produced sugar.


In 1912 the National Legislature passed a law going
considerably further than any previous Act in the matter
of protecting workers in the sugar industry. This
measure is known as the Sugar Bounty Act, 1905-12. It
vests in the Federal Minister power to make application
to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitra-
tion, or any Judge of a Federal State Court, or any
person or persons constituting a State Industrial
Authority, for a declaration as to what wages and con-
ditions of employment are fair and reasonable for labour
performed in the production of sugar. The Minister is
endowed with power to withhold payment of the bounty
ment, and the Federal Acts of the previous year were
brought into force by proclamation in July, 1913. The
effect of this legislation was to greatly simplify the law
in relation to the sugar industry. No further excise was
collected on Australian sugars consumed in the Common-
wealth, and no further bounty was paid on cane grown
by white labour. Black labour was abolished from the
industry, and the grower was protected by a duty of £6
per ton on the imported sugar. After the defeat of the
Denham Government in May, 1915, complaints were made
by their successors that the spirit of the agreement with
the Federal Parliament had not been observed, and that
LOADING CANE ON TRUCKS.
to any employers not complying with the conditions laid
down as fair and reasonable by the authority applied to.
Further legislation was passed later in the same
year by both the Federal and State Parliaments, acting
in agreement with one another. The Federal measures
were the Sugar Excise Repeal Act and the Sugar Bounty
Abolition Act. They were passed conditionally on the
Queensland Parliament adopting legislation abolishing
coloured labour from employment in the sugar industry.
The Denham Government, then in power in the State
House, passed the State Sugar Cultivation Act of 1913.
This was approved of by the Fisher (Federal) Govern-
ss
an inordinate number of special permits had been granted
to coloured men to work on the canefields. This was
regarded as a breach of trust, and the Ryan Government
proceeded to cancel the permits, protesting that the
prosperity of the industry rested on the goodwill of the
people of the other States, who had sanctioned the £6
per ton duty, but who would soon throw the growers
open to competition from duty-free, imported sugar if
the national policy of the preservation of a racial purity
was flouted by the Queensland Government and those
engaged in the industry.
About a year after the outbreak of the great


European War, at the commencement of August, 1914, a
serious position arose in connection with the sugar
industry, and it resulted in drastic action being taken
by both State and Federal Parliaments. Owing to dry
weather at a critical time in the growth of the crop, a big
shortage in local supplies coincided with a period of great
difficulty in obtaining outside supplies at normal prices.
It was alleged by the Federal Attorney-General (Mr. W.
M. Hughes) that large financial interests wilfully contri-
buted to produce this shortage, and that the Government,
on behalf of the people, was justified in stepping in and
taking charge of the position. The allegations of Mr.
Hughes were indignantly denied by those against whom
they had been levelled, but the National and Queensland
Parliaments both passed legislation under which the
latter commandeered the whole of the 1914 crop for
distribution by the Federal Government. This was pro-
vided for by the Sugar Acquisition Act, which also
embodied the temporary nationalization of the mills and
refineries. This placed the industry in the hands of the
Government from the time of the raw product leaving
the hands of the primary producer until the finished
product reached the retailer. Parliament passed the
proposals as a war measure.
A further important measure, passed by the Queens-
land Parliament during the 1915 session was the Cane
Price Boards Act. For a great many years discontent
had centred round the prices paid to growers for their
product. This was greatly accentuated by the State
Industrial Court during 1914 having awarded an increase
of wages to the employes working in the industry. The
whole of this additional expense fell on the shoulders
of the farmers, who were unable to pass it on to the mills,
the latter frequently holding a monopoly over the pro-
duct of a single district, and the Colonial Sugar Refining
Company holding a practical monopoly over the mill-
owners, dependent, as most of them were, on the
refineries of the larger corporation for dealing with the
output. Owing to the nature of the article, sugar-cane
cannot be profitably carried long distances to mills for
crushing. The farmer must therefor© send his product
to that buyer with whom he is connected by some means
of transport. The mills gather cane from the surround-
ing country by tramway systems, and the growers were
necessarily compelled to accept the price fixed by the mill,
as practical competition rarely existed. Hundreds of
thousands of pounds of public money had been spent by
successive Governments in aiding the establishment of
co-operatively owned mills (known as Central Mills). To
some extent this expenditure alleviated the position.
However the Central Mills were still dependent on the
monopolized refineries for treating their product.
The Cane Price Boards Act provides for cane prices
being fixed by boards on which representation is given
to the growers and to the mill-owners, with a chairman
appointed by the Goveraor-in-Council. Provision is
made for each district to have its board, basing decisions
on local conditions; while the right of appeal is held to
a Central Board appointed for the whole of Queensland
and constituted on the same principle as are the local
bodies. This measure constitutes a quite new departure
in legislation. Other Australian Acts provide for prices
to be fixed by boards, but sugar-cane is the first product
to be dealt with in this way by a board on which both
producers and purchasers are directly represented. The
system adopted is analogous to that underlying the
system of wages boards, which are constituted by repre-
sentatives of employes and employers in equal number,
with a Government-appointed chairman to give a casting-
vote in cases where an agreement cannot be arrived at
between the parties.
Under the repealed Bounty Act the Australian
sugar-growing districts were divided into four parts. The
lines of demarcation are interesting as illustrating the
varying degrees of productivity for growing this crop
on the coast. The districts were defined as follows:
“No. 1. —All that portion of Queensland north of
the 19th degree of South latitude, embracing Ingham
(Herbert River), Cardwell, Tully River, Liverpool Creek,
Innisfail (Johnstone River), Mourilyan, Daraji, Babinda
Creek, Aloomba, Mulgrave, Cairns, Atherton, Port
Douglas, Daintree River, Bloomfield River, and Bailey
Creek, Northern Queensland. In this district it was
calculated that it took eight tons of cane to make a ton
of sugar; therefore the bounty was fixed at 7s. 6d.
per ton.
“No. 2.—A1l that portion of Queensland south of the
19th degree of South latitude and north of the 23rd
degree South latitude, embracing Townsville, Ayr
(Lower Burdekin), Bowen, Proserpine, and Mackay,
Northern Queensland. As about eight and a half tons of
cane were required to make a ton of sugar in this district
the bounty was assessed at 7s. per ton.
“No. 3.—A1l that portion of Queensland south of
the 23rd degree South latitude and north of the 26th
degree South latitude, embracing Yeppoon (Central
Queensland), Gladstone, Baffle Creek, Bundaberg,
Childers, Gin Gin, Maryborough, Biggenden, Gayndah,
and Tiaro, Southern Queensland. Nearly nine and one-
fifth tons of cane were necessary to produce a ton of sugar
in this district, and as a result the bounty paid was
6s. 6d. qier ton.

South M ales. The sugar content of the cane in this
district was calculated at 10 to 1, consequently the bounty
was fixed at 6s. per ton.
During the operation of the Acts constituting the
excise tax, import duties, and bounty, from 1901 to 1913,
the Commonwealth revenue received from the sugar
industry in import duty, £3,050,609, and excise,
£6,191,570 j whilst the sum of £3,750,312 was paid in
bounty to growers employing white labour. The net gain
to the revenue was therefore £5,491,867.

THE AUSTRALIAN SUGAR PRODUCERS’ ASSOCIATION LIMITED.
The Australian Sugar Producers’ Association
Limited was founded in 1907, and the fundamental
principle upon which the organization is based is that of
unity amongst the different sections of producers in the
industry. It is regarded as essential that there should
be one central association representative of the industry
as a whole, and able to speak with one voice on its be-
half. The objective of the Association is to embrace every
sugar farm and every sugar mill throughout Australia.
In contrast with this ideal some people advocate the
formation of two separate associations, one for the
growers and the other for the millers, with possibly some
sort of a joint committee to act as a connecting link
between the two when their joint interests were
threatened. Such a scheme, however, is contrary to all
modern ideas of efficient organization. A spirit of har-
monious co-operation is only possible where men are
permanently members of the one body, and inasmuch as
the sugar industry is constantly being assailed by power-
ful interests from outside, it is essential that there should
be such unity within its own ranks, and that there
should be one solid association able to speak with author-
ity on behalf of all its interests.
It may be as well to define here the attitude and
policy of the A.S.P.A. regarding the relation between
the miller and grower. More particularly since the
advent of the Cane Price legislation there is absolutely
no reason why they cannot combine in one association
for their common benefit. Outside the one possible point
of difference —the price to be paid for cane —their inter-
ests are practically identical. The position is well set
forth in the following words:
"The millowner has placed his prosperity in the
hands of the growers. The market which has been
created by the millowner is at the grower’s disposal.
The grower depends, it is true, upon the mill to take his
cane, but the mill depends no less upon him to grow the
cane. The one man cannot exist without the other, and
both are essential to the success of the industry in which
they are mutually interested. The mill must pay, or the
market of the growers is gone. Cane-growing must pay,
or the mill is stopped. This inherent inter-dependence
constitutes the strength of the position and is the safe-
guard of both parties to the bargain.”
At any A.S.P.A. Council Meeting the growers’
representatives are always in an overwhelming majority
as against those of the millers, and there has never been
anything to prevent the Association turning itself into
a purely growers’ institution, if it had been thought
desirable to do so. Such a proposition, in fact, was put
to a definite test in 1916 at an A.S.P.A. Council Meet-
ing, when there were present 27 delegates, 15 of whom
were purely growers, seven were central mill growers,
and five were manufacturers, but only two (the mover
and seconder of the motion) voted in favour of the pro-
posed change. The growers hold, and always have held,
by far the largest influence and greatest power in the
Association, and the fact that the constitution has
remained practically unaltered since its inception is the
best proof that the growers are satisfied with it.
It has been stated in the past by its opponents that
the A.S.P.A. was opposed to the system of Cane Price
legislation. Probably this impression arose in some of
the Southern districts owing to the strong desire of the
Northern growers to obtain the right to make agreements
for a term of years with their mills. Their efforts in
this direction were not favoured by the Minister of the
day, and the A.S.P.A. supported the Northern view.
The Act has since been amended, to permit of the mak-
ing of agreements, and there is therefore no room now
for difference' between the different sections of growers
on this point. The policy of the Association has been
all in favour of the principle of the Cane Price legisla-
tion, its efforts having been directed rather towards mak-
ing the Act a workable proposition on a fair and equit-
able basis. As proof of this attitude reference may be
made to the resolution proposed by the A.S.P.A. repre-
sentatives at the Growers’ Conference summoned by the
Queensland Government so far back as March, 1917.
This resolution was as follows:
"That the sole control of the sugar industry be
handed over to the Commonwealth during the period of
the war, conditional upon the relations between the
miller and the grower being regulated by a State Tri-
bunal, preferably the Cane Prices Board.”
Reference may also be made to the efforts by the
A.S.P.A. to provide a practical scheme for the equitable
payment for cane. Under the auspices of the Associa-
tion a special committee of six sugar chemists was
arranged in 1915, with the result that they recom-
mended the scheme now known as "The Relative Per-
centage System.” This scheme was largely the work of
a former Vice-President of the Association—Dr. Reed—
and the Association adopted it. It is now in successful
operation at three of the largest Northern mills. Mr.
C. H. O’Brien, then one of the chemists above-men-
tioned, and now the technologist on the Central Cane
Prices Board, has been recently nominated by the
.A.S.P.A to proceed to South Africa at the request of
the South African growers, who wish to be informed on
our Queensland experiences as to Cane Price legislation
and other matters.
Among the practical achievements of the Associa-
tion the following may be enumerated:

THE COUNCIL OF THE AUSTRALIAN SUGAR PRODUCERS’ ASSOCIATION LIMITED, FEBRUARY, 1923.


1. It succeeded in getting its President (Senator
Crawford) appointed on the Royal Commission of 1912.
As Mr. Crawford was the only practical grower with
first-hand experience of the industry on the Commission,
this appointment was of the utmost importance, and the
growers’ interests were well looked after by him, as can
readily be seen by those who have read the report. The
A.S.P.A. was directly consulted in this matter, inas-
much as their Secretary (Mr. Pritchard) was sent to
Melbourne, and the Minister of Trade and Customs in-
vited him to put in writing the views of the Association
as to the nature and scope of the inquiry and other
matters. This invitation was of course accepted, and it
may be said that the nature of the work which was laid
down for the Commission was practically that which was
outlined by the A.S.P.A. Furthermore, when the Com-
mission was gathering its evidence, Mr. Pritchard per-
sonally visited the different centres in advance, and
materially assisted the growers in compiling and mar-
shalling their evidence.
2. Although the system of Excise and Bounty is
now a matter of ancient history, the work of the
A.S.P.A. during that period should not be forgotten.
It was instrumental in getting every Minister of Trade
and Customs to visit the sugar areas of Queensland with
a view to obtaining first-hand knowledge of the industry,
the destinies of which were then so- largely controlled by
the Minister of the day. It also got Sir John Forrest,
when Acting Prime Minister, to do likewise. The Asso-
ciation, in fact, was the chief mover in bringing about
the abolition of the iniquitous system under which the
growers were taxed to the extent of 2s. to 2s. 6d. per
ton on their cane.
3. One of the first practical steps of the Association
was to establish a newspaper devoted to the interests of
those engaged in the industry. This is '‘The Australian
Sugar Journal,” now recognized as an authority in all
countries where sugar is grown. It is regarded as the
official mouthpiece of the Australian industry, besides
being a most valuable educational medium to all those
engaged in the industry. For years past a copy of every
issue has been sent to all members of the Federal Parlia-
ment.
4. The action of the various Price Boards in differ-
ent States after the commencement of the war will be
remembered by most sugar growers. These Boards
most unfairly held down the price of sugar, and the in-
dustry for a time was practically at their mercy. It was
the A.S.P.A. which took the promptest possible action
to meet the situation. It soon induced the Queensland
Board to increase the price by £2 ss. per ton, and it sent
no less than three separate delegations at its own expense
to Sydney and Melbourne to put the case of the industry
before the Boards there. Ultimately it succeeded in get-
ting them to increase the price.
5. In the case of the notorious Dickson Award the
A.S.P.A. appealed to the Queensland Full Court and
succeeded there very substantially. As a full measure
of relief was not obtained, the Association went on to
the High Court of Australia, and was on the eve of a
great victory which would have wiped out the Award,
when the Queensland Government proclaimed the new
Industrial Arbitration Act. In the face of this the
High Court decided that they could not give a judg-
ment. The whole of this great effort- on behalf of the
Queensland sugar industry was initiated and carried
through by the A.S.P.A., and cost the Association in
legal costs alone the sum of <£2,000. Ultimately the
A.S.P.A reopened the Dickson Award in the Queens-
land Arbitration Court, and succeeded in obtaining a
substantial reduction in the unjust wages which had been
awarded and a modification of the conditions.
6. Further important work at this period was done
by the Association. The President and Secretary under
instructions from the Council proceeded to Melbourne
with the object of inducing the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to take over during the period of the war, full con-
trol of the industry, and to grant an increased price for
raw sugar. In the latter point they were successful.
Later they succeeded in getting the Prime Minister to
renew the then existing Sugar Agreement for a period
of two years instead of one.
7. In February and March, 1920, the A.S.P.A.
took definite steps to induce the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to increase the price of raw sugar to £3O 6s. Bd,
per ton. The facts and figures to support the case upon
which the Prune Minister was so insistent, were prepared
and presented by the A.S.P.A. Everything possible
was done by the Association to ensure a renewal of the
Sugar Agreement, when the matter should come up
before Parliament. A publicity campaign was inaugur-
ated in order to bring the facts before the people, and
to create a general sentiment favourable towards the
sugar industry. In this work the A.S.P.A. expended
some £4,000, and it represented probably the most com-
plete publicity effort hitherto attempted by any industry
in Australia. Although the ignorance and prejudices
concerning the industry were thus dissipated to a con-
siderable extent, it became clear to those at the heart
ol things that there was no hope whatever of getting a
renewal of the Sugar Agreement from the then existing
Parliament. Public opinion was solidly against Govern-
ment control of industry in any shape or form, and the
majority of Parliamentary members, irrespective of
party politics, reflected that opinion, yet in the face of
si long opposition (backed by a most unsympathetic Re-
poit from the Tariff Board), the duty was increased to


£9 6s. Bd. per ton, or in other words, a flat rate of Id.
per lb. on all sugars. The proposal submitted to the
House by the Hughes Government was for £9 6s. Bd.
(Id. per lb.) on raw sugars, and £ll 13s. 4d. (l|d. per
lb.) on white and refined sugars. This latter rat© would
have given a much better protection against our chief
competitor, Java mill whites.
Although the A.S.P.A. does not regard the present
duty as adequate, still it was a substantial achievement
to have obtained an increase of some 56 per cent. One
thing is certain, however; if it had not been for the per-
spicacity and the efforts of the A.S.P.A. on this occa-
sion, the sugar industry might very easily have fallen
between two stools. With no assurance whatever of a
renewal of the Sugar Agreement, and with a totally in-
adequate protective tariff, the dawn of the year 1923
would indeed have been gloomy in the extreme.
Melbourne Exhibition in September last. All the ex-
penses of this and other publicity work on behalf of the
industry have been borne by the A.S.P.A., and no con-
tribution has been asked or expected from any outside
sources.
9. An important side to the A.S.P.A. is its Indus-
trial Department. The work in connection with the
Arbitration Court is constantly on the increase, and has
become of the utmost importance. As the total wages
bill in any -season amounts to several millions of pounds,
it follows that the concession of even some minor point
under the Award may involve the growers in a loss of
thousands of pounds. The Association therefore keeps
in the closest touch with all industrial matters, and can
now claim to be the only organization which regularly
represents the growers before the Arbitration Court.
Since the finalizing of the Sugar A ward in July, 1921,
THE COLONIAL SUGAR REFINING COMPANY’S BUILDINGS ON THE RIVER AT NEW FARM, BRISBANE.
8. Amongst the minor activities of the Association
it may be mentioned that it held a Sugar Court at the
Melbourne Exhibition in 1921 entirely at its own ex-
pense. On this occasion a special pamphlet dealing with
the industry was prepared and 5,000 copies distributed
free for publicity purposes. This pamphlet has been
very favourably reviewed by the press, and has been
reprinted by the British Empire Producers’ Organiza-
tion. The special “Sugar tissue” of the Brisbane
Courier on the recent visit of the Prime Minister was
also the work of the A.S.P.A., and at the August Show
of the Royal National Exhibition in Brisbane the “Sugar
Court’’ was promoted entirely by the Association. This
was adjudged on all hands bo be an unqualified success,
and a similar “Sugar Court” was again held at the
the whole of this work has fallen upon the A.S.P.A.,
no appearance on behalf of the growers having been
even entered by any other organization professing to
represent their interests. It may be mentioned that dur-
ing the 1921 season alone there were 19 separate cases
affecting the industry before the Court in Brisbane, in
15 of which the A.S.P.A. was successful. The
A.S.P.A. does not lay claim to perfection, but it can at
least point to a solid record of successful work on behalf
of the industry extending now to a period of over 15
years, and it has done its best to deal fairly and justly
with all. There are many other industries in Australia
to-day that would do well in studying and following the
principles of organization embodied in The Australian
Sugar Producers’ Association Limited.

ant of old Scottish stock, whose pro-
genitors had been agrarian land-
owners in Ayrshire from remote
times and had owned “Milzeoch”—■
which was also the birthplace of

the birth of Robert Burns, the

countrymen are so justly proud. As
a result of the oppressive land laws
then existing, the old home was lost

father, the late James McClanachan,
who, when the subject of this memoir
was approaching manhood, was
engaged in farming near Cumnock.
The latter, Mr. Andrew McClana-

of “Milzeoch,” which have remained

School—Mr. McKinnel being head
teacher—at Cumnock. When at the
age of twenty, impelled by the
desire of a wider life and larger
opportunities, he set sail for Aus-
tralia, and on November 11, 1862,
arrived in Keppel Bay, having
voyaged in the “Utopia,” which
was the first immigrant vessel to

touch at Rockhampton. Three days
after landing at that now prosperous
city he engaged as a shepherd for
“Collaroy,” a station lying between
the present town of St. Lawrence
and Mackay, and immediately sailed
for the former by a small craft, the
“Ben Bolt,” with a mate who had
been his fellow-passenger on the
overseas voyage. The new arrivals
reached St. Lawrence on Christmas
Day and thence, after a week, pro-
ceeded on foot in the direction of
“Collaroy,” spending the night of
New Year’s Eve under the stars on
the top of Connor’s Range, and the
first night of the new year at a
shepherd’s hut twelve miles from the
station, where they learned how
dangerous and treacherous were the
blacks at that time. The following
afternoon found them at "Collaroy,”
where they remained for four years,
at the end of which, owing to the
difficulties experienced from the
blacks—at whose hands two shep-
herds had then recently lost their
lives—and the owner’s decision that
the prevalence of the spear grass
rendered the country quite unsuit-
able for sheep they made two of a
party commissioned to travel 13,000
wethers to the Murrumbidgee. He
severed his connection with "Col-
laroy” in April, 1867, and shortly
afterwards was engaged as a drover
by Mr. McClean, then owner of
“Bindango” Station, for whom he
travelled with a mob of wethers to
New South Wales. The trip accom-
plished, he decided to try his hand at
mining, and as Gympie was looming
largely in the public eye, he imme-
diately set out for this field, at which
he arrived in 1868, but the alluvial
having practically panned out and
the machinery for testing the reef
being yet awaited, things were rather
at a standstill. He continued fossick-
ing until his funds were reduced to
three shillings, when he set himself
to look for surer employment than
the goldfield then offered him. This
he found on "Bonaro” Station, sixty
miles from Gympie, where he spent

about a year, leaving there as a result
of the newspaper reports of the possi-
bilities of the sugar industry in the
Mackay district and of his desire of
exercising the training he had


received in agriculture in the Old
World. Putting his new intention
into effect, he travelled on foot as far
as Maryborough, and from there
proceeded to Rockhampton by boat.
From Rockhampton he overlanded to
“Collaroy,” the station on which his
first years in Australia were spent,
and there, after completing a pedes-
trian journey of 160 miles, was given
a heai'ty welcome. A week or two
was spent in carrying out some work
required on the station, and it speaks
well for the esteem in which he was
held in the district that during this
time he should have been approached
by a Mr. Fitzsimons—then on the
eve of starting a plantation—with an
offer of the maximum wages for field
surroundings. On his recovery he
became engaged on the erection of
one of the early mills, and after
about twelve months with his
employer, a Mr. Spider, accepted a
post at Foulden, in connection with
which he became very proficient in
engineering. His next employment
was at Pleystowe, and here he re-
mained until 1874; thence he went
to Mackay, where, on a farm owned
by a Mr. Joshling, he worked for a
year. In 1875 he rented twenty acres
of land and purchased a plough team,
but that being a bad year for the
owners owing to the visitation called
the “rust,” which made necessary
the ploughing out of all the old
plants to make place for new varieties
the industry was marked by a public-
spiritedness and neighbourliness that
rendered him most highly esteemed
among his fellow planters and others,
as did, also, the qualities of industry
and integrity which distinguished
him. For many years be was a mem-
ber of the Meadowlands Milling Com-
pany, in which capacity his advice as
an old experienced farmer proved of
the utmost value. He has demonstra-
ted in his own person the value of tee-
totalism as a factor towards physical
well-being and successful enterprise,
having been a total abstainer from
alcohol for thirty-one years. Mr.

work. He accepted Mr. Fitzsimons’
offer, and after reaching Mackay,
which district at that time boasted of
only one mill, the Alexandra —the
Pleystowe being in course of erection
—entered upon his first year in the
sugar industry, at the end of which
he took a position under Mr. Walker,
of “Dumbleton.” After a brief
period spent at “Dumbleton,” he
again yielded to the fascination of
the mining industry, deciding to try
his luck at the Ravenswood diggings.
Here he spent six months, in the
course of which, though finding
the field profitable, he experienced
intense hardships and suffered con-
siderably in health, being finally
obliged to return to more civilized
of cane, he used his team for contract
work until 1878, when he planted
twelve acres which yielded so excel-
lent a return the following year that
he was enabled to purchase the block
that he had hitherto held under
rental. From this start he became
in time one of the best known of the
cane growers in the Mackay dis-
trict, having gradually enlarged his
interests by further purchases sur-
rounding his original block. Pie con-
tinued to be actively connected with
the industry until the year 1911,
when he sold the bulk of the land on
which he had effected so much, retain-
ing half an acre merely for the site

wife now reside. His long career in

half a century. The daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. McClanachan married Mr.
J. M. Gibson, whose property,

inherited, as is a treasured violin

a hundred years.


JAMES MARK GIBSON, J.P.,
“Selwyn,” Mackay, is a native of
Glasgow, Scotland, his birthday
being October 22, 1878. He is of old
Scottish descent and a son of Mr.
MR. A. GIBSON.
Andrew Gibson, J.P., who was born
in Stranraer, Wigtonshire, in the
year 1853, and educated primarily
at the Free Church school, and
later at a finishing academy of that
town. Many generations of the
Gibsons were associated with com-
merce in Stranraer, but Mr. Andrew
Gibson, after having spent a brief
period in a law office, decided to
make engineering his profession.
With this objective he entered upon
an apprenticeship which lasted seven
years, during which he became pro-
ficient in draughtsmanship and other
branches of engineering. On the con-
clusion of his training he became
attached to the Clyde Shipbuilding
Works at Port Glasgow, and subse-
quently, when in the late twenties,
joined his brother in establishing in
his native town a firm of millwrights
and carpenters, and was engaged in
this business until, some time later,
he made up his mind to come to Aus-
tralia. This decision was prompted
by the representations of the late
Mr. Russell, an emigration agent,
and put into effect in the year 1883.
Choosing Northern Queensland in
which to settle, he in due course
arrived with his wife and the four
sons then constituting his family, in
the north-eastern waters of Australia
and landed in Mackay, where he
secured a post as a pattern-maker in
Cameron’s Foundry. Here he was
occupied for two years, at the end of
which, in 1885, he undertook duties
of a more responsible character as
manager of the Pine Yale Saw Mills,
and this continued to engage his
energies until, during the following
year, he was induced to accept the
position of engineer at the Victoria,
Eton, where he remained until opera-
tions ceased at that mill. Early in
the year 1900 he was appointed
engineer of the Nindaroo Mill at
North Mackay, which was then under
the management of Mr. W. T.
Paget, and he continued to carry
out the duties incidental to this post
for a period spread over nearly ten
years, finally retiring owing to the
circumstance of his health being
seriously undermined as a result of
overwork due to the difficulty of
getting capable assistance. After a
period of rest, however, he had
recuperated sufficiently to re-associ-
ate himself with the industry in a
professional capacity, undertaking, at
the instance of the late E. M. Long,
an engagement to draw plans, for
presentation to the Government, of
the then projected Pleystowe Mill,
which the farmers desired to have
erected under the Sugar Act of the
period. The Pleystowe was the first
mill erected in the district under that
Act, and Mr. Gibson was also em-
ployed in this connection to dismantle
the Garleoch Mill and re-erect the
machinery at Pleystowe. Subse-
quently he became engaged as
Inspecting Engineer in connection
with the erection of the Plane Creek
Mill, and on the completion of his
duties in this capacity he accepted
the management of the Marian Mill,
a position which he filled for about
two years. At the end of that period
he was requested to take over his old
post at Nindaroo, and, acquiescing,
entered once more upon the duties
which he had formerly so long and
capably discharged, and remained
here until the mill was closed down.
He then took a post as engineer at
Fairleigh, under the management of
Mr. Bolton, and shortly afterwards
removed to a farm which he had
purchased as an interest for his
declining years, deciding that he
v.'ould find sufficient output for his
energy by overlooking the cane-
growing operations which he intended
to carry on here. However, at this
time the late Mr. McCready, who
was an old friend and the then
manager and proprietor of the
Palmyra Mill, solicited his services
in connection with difficulties he was
having with his machinery, and Mr.
Gibson acceding, took charge for him
and continued to direct operations at
the Palmyra until, after three years,
a competent man was secured to fill
the position. His professional reputa-
tion was well established in the dis-
tricts round Mackay, and since he
has been engaged in farming on his
own account at “Mt. Blackwood,”
near Hampden, his services have
been more or less in demand when a
consulting engineer has been required
at the different mills. He has devoted
himself so whole-heartedly to the
advancement of the sugar industry
during his long sojourn in his
adopted country that his public-
spirited efforts deserve the fullest
recognition. A member of the first

when the representative men of the
industry recognized that further steps
should be taken for safeguarding the
growers’ interests than hitherto,


when the Pioneer River growers
only were combined for the purpose
—he was requested to take over the
work of organizing the body, of
which he was appointed secretary, a
capacity in which he has since con-
tinued to successfully apply his ex-
tensive knowledge of the various
branches of sugar production. He
has been a member of the council of
the Pioneer River Farmers’ and
Graziers’ Association for some years,
and lias rejoresented the interests of
the growers on the local Cane Prices
Board. His Commission as a Justice
of the Peace was received under the
Philp Administration many years
ago, Mr. Gibson, sen., was twice
married, on the first occasion to
Margaret Dorman Boyes, and on the
second, on February 22, 1889, some
years after the death of that lady,
to Florence Minnie Perry, who came
to Australia from the Old World in
the year 1888. Of the first union
there was a family of five sons, the
youngest of whom was born in Aus-
tralia; and of the second, a daughter,
who was also born under the
Southern Cross. Of Mr. Gibson’s
sons, one, the late A. R. S. Gibson,
died in the course of the Great War
of 1914-18, while on service, having
contracted an illness which proved
fatal. The others, including Mr. J.
M. Gibson, of “Selwyn,” and Mr.
\\ illiam Gibson, the present manager
of the Inkerman Mill, are all engaged
in the sugar industry in Northern
Queensland. Mr. J. M. Gibson pur-
sued his education at the Habana
School until after the completion of
his fourteenth year, when he became
engaged in commercial pursuits at
Hill End, Mackay. When on the
border of manhood he began to
seriously consider the future and the
means by which he might enter upon
a congenial and successful career. A
study of analytical chemistry ap-
peared a desirable channel towards
the attainment of this end, and
having come to such a decision he
applied himself to the mastery of his
chosen subject, studying to such pur-
pose that ere long he secured em-
ployment in a professional capacity
at one of the mills. For a period
spread over a quarter of a century
he was continuously occupied as
chemist and mill manager for
different owners, filling the position
at the Habana, Pieystowe, and

Racecourse Mills. In 1917 he re-
signed the management of the Race-
course Mill, which he had controlled
for four years, and became wholly
engaged in the administration of his
farming interests, having acquired
both “The Leap’’ and “Meadow
Vale’’ during his long connection
with the industry as mill manager.
He had purchased “The Leap” in
the year 1900, and “Meadow Vale,”
which was portion of the old
“Meadowlands” Estate, six years
after his first venture. From 1906
until 1917 he resided at and person-
ally supervised operations at
“Meadow Vale,” but, in the latter
year, purchasing “Selwyn,” he re-
moved to that farm, which is now
his headquarters and the centre from
which he manages his separate in-
terests in the industry, which are so
extensive as to claim for him the
distinction of being the “largest”
sugar grower in the district outlying
Mackay. “Selwyn” Farm harvests
some 160 acres of cane annually, the
yield averaging about 40 tons to the
acre in a good season. It is most
desirably situated, being within four
miles of Mackay and in near
proximity to the Racecourse Mill, its
value being further enhanced by the
character of its improvements, which
merit for it description as one of the
most up-to-date and forwardly-
developed sugar properties in the dis-
trict. A considerable outlay of
capital has resulted in a charming
homestead, which was erected in the
year 1914, and various modern and
solidly-constructed outbuildings, the
value of all the structural improve-
ments being estimated at about
£3,000. Tire homestead, which on
every side commands an extensive
view of the canefields, is of artistic
design and contains eleven large airy
rcoms and is surrounded by wide
latticed verandahs which are ap-
proached from prettily laid-out
grounds comprising lawns and flower-
laden and shrub-bedecked beds, and
are farther beautified by well-grown
ornamental shade trees. Mr. Gibson
has for the past twenty-five years
and over devoted himself too closely
to his work and to the study of the
various phases of sugar production to
permit of his prominent connection
with public life, but his assistance
has been accorded to such movements
as tend to promote progress and the
general welfare of the community.
He is an advocate of all forms of field
sports and heartily supports their
representative bodies. His marriage
occurred in the year 1910 to Gustava
Catherine, only daughter of the late
Andrew McClanachan, who for many
years was one of the prominent sugar
growers of the Mackay district, and
an account of whose career appears

1 LANE CREEK CENTRAL
INI ILL CO., LID. Away back in
the middle eighties, when the legis-
lation of the Griffith Ministry
decided upon a discontinuance of
the recruiting of coloured labour in
the South Seas, and, as a conse-
quence, the restriction of coloured
labour in the canefields oi Queens-
land, it was felt by the planters
then associated with the sugar in-
dustiy that the death knell of that
industry had been sounded. It was
thought by those interested, and it
had not then been proved otherwise,
that the work of carrying on a
purely tropical industry like sugar-
growing could not be satisfactorily
Government, supported by the Mcll-
wraith Opposition, favoured the sug-
gestion, and the outcome was the
erection of Racecourse and North
Eton Central Mills. Those mills,
worked on co-operative lines, proved
that cane could be successfully grown
and manufactured into sugar by
white labour alone. The Government
of the following years, encouraged
by the success of the central mill
scheme, evolved the idea of erecting
sugar mills under the Sugar Works
Guarantee Act, whereby the Gov-
ernment agreed to advance to land
owners, upon their mortgaging their
lands, the money to purchase and
erect a mill, such advance to be
£60,000. An inspection of the lands
was made, also a valuation by Mr.
R. W. McCulloch, Government
Valuator, and an order was
jolaced with Walkers Ltd., of Mary-
borough, for the erection of a mill.
That enterprising firm soon got
things under way both at their
works in Maryborough and also on
the site of the proposed mill, the site
chosen being on the left bank of
Plane Creek just above the main
stock route to St. Lawrence. In
order to assist in the transport of
the machinery from Louisa Creek
(where a wharf had been erected) to
the mill site, some fifteen miles of
2-ft. gauge tramway was constructed

and profitably continued without
coloured labour. It was claimed
that tropical industries had to be
associated with the inhabitants of
tropical countries. Some of the
broad-minded men of Mackay at the
time, such as Thomas Pearce, Wil-
liam George Hodges, Patrick Mc-
Kenny, H. B. Black, and probably
others, conceived the idea that an
experiment should be made to prove
the fallacy of the ideas of the sugar
planters. With this end in view they
approached the then Premier of
Queensland, Sir Samuel Walker
Griffith, to place on the Estimates
a sum of money for the erection
of central mills. The Griffith
repaid to- the Government in equal
annual payments of interest and
redemption over a period of twenty-
five years. One of the first districts
to take advantage of the Sugar
W orks Guarantee Act was Plane
Creek, enthusiastically led by Pat-
rick McKenny, and supported by H.
Bell, E. and R. Atherton, J. C.
Nicholson, and others, with George
Beresford as their secretary. On
November 25, 1893, the first meet-
ing was held, and after several
months of strenuous work and
numerous meetings the necessary
land owners of the district agreed
to form the Plane Creek Central
Mill Co., Ltd., with a capital of
under the supervision of Bernard C.
Dupuy, now authorised surveyor of
Mackay district. In April, 1895,
the tender of Walkers Ltd. was
accepted, and the first shipload of
machinery was landed at Louisa
Creek early in 1896, and in Novem-
ber the first cane was put into the
rollers of the mill. As with most
concerns of the kind, there were
many trials and tribulations to be
met and overcome, and much credit
is due to the indomitable pluck and
perseverance of the early Threctors
of the Company in establishing in
the Plane Creek district a mill which
has converted the district from a
purely grazing wilderness into a rich


agricultural community, which, in
the year of its making its final pay-
ment to the Queensland Govern-
ment, obtained from the soil a pro-
duct of the value of a quarter of a
million pounds sterling. Not only
is credit due to those who were in-
strumental in establishing the mill,
but also to those who laboured to
supply the cane to make the venture
a success, as well as to the business
acumen of those who from time to
time formed the different Boards of
Directors throughout the period of
from 1896 to 1921. In reviewing
the personnel of the different Boards
of Directors, it is a most noteworthy
fact that some of the present mem-
bers have been associated with the
Board since the inception of the
Company, many of them for the
major portion and all for a very long
time, proving the wisdom of utilizing
the experience which each Director
had gained in the interests of the
Company. The mill when erected
was to be capable of crushing 50,000
tons of cane, whereas to-day it has
a capacity of 90,000 or 100,000 tons,
demonstrating in a most practical
manner the progress that has been
made during the period of opera-
tions. The mill originally consisted
of two sets of three 5-ft. rollers,
with the usual engines, carriers,
maceration baths, conveyers, etc.,
but has now an additional set of
rollers, making three sets in all, with
intervening plant. At first the old
style of clarifiers were used, but these
are now superseded by the modern
superheaters in duplicate. With the
usual triple effet system there has
been supplemented an additional
large effet pot. The subsider station
has been duplicated and the filter
presses eliminated. Two vacuum
pans are in service, where there was
only one when the mill was erected.
Probably the least up-to-date por-
tion of the mill is the centrifugal
station, consisting of nine centri-
fugals 30" x 15", but this station is
being reorganized, and for next
season these will be replaced by five
centrifugals 40” x 24" of the self-
discharging type. In the sugar
room is installed a drier and the
necessary fan, air heater, also
hopper, weighing scales, bag-sewing
machinery, and mechanical elevator
for loading direct on the tramway
trucks ready for hauling to the port
of shipment. Steam is supplied
from three Babcock & Wilcox water
tube boilers with a supplementary
multitubular boiler if required. A
fine electrical plant and workshop
complete the mill equipment. The
present mill and its equipment has
proved this year that it is capable
of treating 3,850 tons of cane per
week and manufacturing the same
into sugar, and in a long season
turning out up to 12,000 tons of
raw sugar. The Plane Creek district
formerly comprised the land between
Alligator and Plane Creeks from the
sea coast to the Connor’s Range, an
area of from sixty to seventy-five
square miles of country. This area
is served by a network of 2-ft. gauge
tramways, in all about fifty miles,
with the usual sidings and loading
stations at convenient intervals. To
transport the cane to the mill from
the different sidings where it is
loaded by the cane grower on to
PORTION OF CARMILA TRAMWAY.
trucks by lifts or from truck wag-
gons, there is provided by the Com-
pany about 500 wooden trucks well
equipped with chains, springs, etc.,
and eminently suited for the work.
A supply of trucks is provided for
conveying the sugar from the mill
to the large shed, which has a hold-
ing capacity of 1,100 tons, at
Louisa Creek, where it is loaded by
a mechanical conveyor into the
barges which carry it to Flat Top
for transhipment by the sugar
steamers to the refineries in the
capital cities of Australia. The
haulage power for the transporting
of the cane and also of the sugar on
the truck tramway is supplied by
two 12-ton locomotives and two 10-
ton locomotives, two of the loco-
motives being provided with tenders.
The area under cultivation amounts
to, including land resting and in
fallow, about 6,000 acres, and the
quantity of cane produced each year
depends to a considerable extent
upon the favourable nature ol the
season. With the completion of the
Mackay-St. Lawrence section of the
North Coast line there has been
added to the Plane Creek district a
considerable area of first-class agri-
cultural land lying between the
Connor’s Range and the sea coast
south of Plane Creek for a distance
along the railway line of about fifty
miles. In order to- encourage settle-
ment along the railway and at the
same time emphasize the sincerity of
their advocacy for settlement, the
Directors of Plane Creek Mill have
just completed, at heavy cost, the
construction of four and a half miles
of tramway at Carmila and placed
upon it a locomotive and the rolling
stock necessary to deal with the cane
offering in that locality. The Board
of Directors has realized that a full
supply of cane throughout the sea-
son is necessary for the future suc-
cess of the Company, and with this
end in view has adopted the policy
of encouragement of settlement
on the many thousands of acres
of agricultural land lying unproduc-
tive between Sarina and Flaggy
Rock Creek. Of the Board of
Directors to-day, Mr. Alex. Tnnes,
the chairman, has been actively asso-
ciated with the mill since 1895,
being appointed a Director in April
of that year and retiring from the
directorate after about six years’
service, only to be reappointed in
1910, and becoming Chairman of
Directors in 1911, which position he
has occupied continuously ever since.
Messrs. J. C. Nicholson, A. E.
Atherton, E. J. Brewer, and D.
Greetham hold unique records as
members of the Board of Directors,
two of them, Messrs. Nicholson and
Greetham, having occupied the posi-
tion of chairman for different terms.
The other members, Messrs. R. A.
McKie, E. Newbery, P. Peterson,
and A. Patterson, have been asso-
ciated with the directorate for a
continuous period of some ten years
or more. It must be noted that the
previous manager of the mill, Mr.
J. Noden, occupied the position for
over twenty years, and Mr. George
Beresford, the first Secretary, held
the position for twenty years until
1913, when he resigned, and the
present Secretary, Mr. J. H. Lan-
dells, was appointed.

England, on March 27, 1864, and is
a son of the late William Jackson,

an old English agrarian family

associated with primary production

in the history of the County. The
subject of this memoir was also
brought up in agricultural surround-
ings, and on reaching manhood,
realizing that the scope in the
Motherland for expansion in landed
pursuits was far too limited to
encourage him to hope for any great
degree of individual success, decided
to try his fortune in Australia,
choosing the then Colony of Queens-
land as possessing even greater
potentialities for the farmer or
grazier than the other divisions of
this vast wealth-producing Continent.
His subsequent career has notably
demonstrated how such potentialities
may be materialized by a man who
does not regard hard work as an
obstacle to success, and whose ability
and industry are combined with
tenacity of purpose, for Mr. Jack-
son’s standing as a representative of
the sugar industry in the Mackay
district has been won by his own
unaided efforts and from beginnings
so small as to call for the exercise
of considerable self-sacrifice, grit,
and determination. His first work
in his adopted country was obtained
in the South Kennedy district, in
the vicinity of Mackay, in 1886, and
he entered upon his lengthy career
here as an employe on a sugar farm.
Before he had been long in the
country his services were engaged
by the proprietary of the North
Eton Sugar Mill, his work in this
connection having to do with the
equine stock, of which he was placed
in charge. He continued, as an

employe, to be associated with the
North Eton Mill—of which, by the
way, he afterwards became a director
—for eight years, at the end of which
period he had accumulated sufficient
capital to make a start in sugar pro-
duction on his own account in a
small way. His initial start was
made in the year 1894 with the
acquirement of the property known
MR. C. JACKSON .
as “The Grange,” the development
of which absorbed his energies until,
twelve years later, he transferred
the holding by gift to the younger
of his sons, and embarked upon
another venture with the purchase
of the “Central” Farm in the year
1906. “Central” Farm, upon which
he immediately took up his resi-
dence, has since continued to be his


home and the headquarters from
which he administers his various
interests. Three years after its
acquirement, in 1909, he became the
purchaser of “Rosevale,” another

North Eton, which he carried on in
conjunction with “The Grange”

JAMES McDonald, "The Her-
mitage,” Mackay, was born at
Glenavy, County Antrim, Ireland,
on January 11, 1866, and is the eld-
est son of the late Robert McDonald,
MR. J. McDONALD.
a member of a North of Ireland
family which crossed over from
Scotland before the time of the
Scotch Colonization in that part of
MR. W. McDONALD.
Ireland, where the McDonald family
were established. On the maternal
side, also, the subject of this memoir
is a scion of an old North of Ireland
family of Scottish origin, his mother,
tt2
whose maiden name was Elizabeth
Rae, having descended from the
famous Stewart clan, which figures
so prominently in Scottish history.
Mr. James McDonald was primarily
educated at Glenavy, and later
became a student at the National
School in Belfast, which he attended
until reaching the age of fourteen,
when he served an apprenticeship at
gardening in Carrickfergus. On
becoming proficient in this calling he
proceeded to England, where, in
Birkenhead, he was appointed to the
post of head gardener on the prop-
erty of the late Francis I. Preston,
whom Mr. McDonald recalls as a
member of one of the oldest families
of aristocratic lineage in England.
Gardening occupied his energies un-
til he arrived at his middle thirties,
a stage in his existence which had for
some time been preceded by the
realization that the opportunities of
his trade in the Old World were too
limited to allow him to make the
headway that, for his family’s sake,
he desired, and which had decided
him to undertake, as soon as prac-
ticable, a journey to South Africa,
with Johannesburg in view as his
destination. His decision was hardly
made, however, before the now his-
torical Jameson Raid eventuated and
gave rise to extremely unsettled con-
ditions in the Transvaal, the accounts
of which caused Mr. McDonald to
alter his jJ an s. Eventually, he set
out with his wife and three children
then born to him for Australia and
in due course arrived at Port Mac-
kay, Queensland, the date of his
landing being December 31, 1901.
Farming seeming the most suitable
employment from a remunerative
point of view for a man of his ac-
quirements, it was not long before
he secured a post under his first and
only employer in his adopted coun-
try —Mr. Innes of “Plane Creek.”
At “Plane Creek” he got his first
insight into the sugar industry and
there remained for nine months, at
the end of which he saw an oppor-
tunity of engaging on his own ac-
count in market gardening at Foul-
den, a centre a few miles distant
from Mackay. Before the completion
of two years his operations at Foul-
den had placed him in the position
of starting, in conjunction with Mr.
Michelmore, in the sugar industry
on the property— which is known as
“The Hermitage”—yet occupied by
the partners, whose activities here
embraced both dairying and sugar
production for a very lengthy period,
Mr. McDonald having been the
principal supplier of dairy produce
to the now City of Mackay for fifteen
years. Finally dairying was discon-
tinued by the partners and the

McDonald were born in Bebbington,
Cheshire, England, and primarily
educated at the widely-known Port
Sunlight School. After the family’s
arrival in Australia they attended
the State School in Mackay, where
they continued to study until they
were each of an age to start on the
land. Mr. McDonald’s youngest
son, Alfred John, who is now en-
gaged in assisting his father and
eldest brother at “The Hermitage,”
was born in Mackay on November
12, 1902, and educated at the Mac-
kay High School, where he studied
for the Junior University Examin-
ation, ere finally deciding on a
his part as a public-spirited and gen-
erous citizen, devoting himself un-
selfishly and unsparingly to the in-
terests of the community, though his
activities, like those of his partner,
Mr. Michelmore, have been carried
out in an unostentatious manner.

work for the sugar industry and is

several years he was a director of the

was the holder of municipal honours

years, he familiarized himself with
every aspect of stock and station
work and administration, and fdled,
for the last three years of his associa-
tion with the holding, the position of
manager, only relinquishing his
responsible duties when “Bindango”
passed from the family by sale.
Shortly afterwards, in 1908, when the
possibilities of sugar-growing were
such as to promise good results for
financial investment, he decided to
apply his energies in this direction,
and, choosing the district with which
his father had been so long identified,
purchased in partnership with the
latter the land now designated “Hill-
crest.” Since 1908, cane culture has
chiefly claimed his attentions, and it
should be mentioned that he has
made so thorough a study of this
subject that it would be difficult to
find a sugar area in Queensland
worked ori more scientific lines. He
has demonstrated how greatly an
expert theoretical knowledge counts
in sugar-growing—as in every enter-
prise associated with the land —by

PPIILIP HECTOR McLEAN,

was born at "Jolimont,” a Queens-
land pastoral station situated
on the route between Bowen
and Mackay. He is the third son of
the late John Henry McLean—who
was part owner of “Jolimont” dur-
ing his lifetime—and a grandson of
Jonathan McLean, a Queensland
pioneer of the fifties, who formed
and owned "Bindango” Station,
near Roma, in the Maranoa district,
before the great North-eastern por-
tion of the Continent had achieved
independence as a Colony. What
Jonathan McLean accomplished in
the way of pastoral development in
the southern portion of the State
was worthily paralleled by his son in
Northern Queensland in the course
of his operations at "Jolimont,”
and his efforts continue to be
emulated by his grandsons on the
land in the Mackay district. The
subject of this memoir, Philip H.
McLean, was born on September 23,
1885, and educated primarily under
private tuition at home and second-
arily at the Mackay High School,
where he pursued his studies until,
having decided on the land as the
basis of a future career, he was sent
to the Queensland Agricultural Col-
lege, Hatton, to specialize in stock
and agriculture. He remained at
Gatton for three years, at the end
of which, having graduated, he

which, in his first season, yielded
about 500 tons of cane. From year
to year he increased the acreage of
his property, which produced pro-
portionately, until its average yearly
output reached a tonnage of 2000.
"Allawah,” as the farm is named,
now covers 200 acres, which, when
all under cultivation, to which stage
it is being gradually brought, will
probably harvest double its present
yield. The "Allawah” dwelling

details of comfort which add incal-

primarily to cane-growing and its
allied industries, Mr. McLean has in
a lesser degree identified himself
with the pastoral industry, having

Wales, with his father, the late
James Stevens, in the year 1832,
he being then only four years old.
Eleven months before (in November,
1831), James Stevens, his wife
Sarah, and their four surviving
children, embarked on the sailing
ship “Duke of Buccleugh,” the
second free immigrant vessel des-
patched from the Old Land to Aus-
tralia, and the voyage, full of
incident, proved a memorable event
in their lives. At length, however,
it came to an end in October of the
year named, and the English settler
founded his home under the
Southern Cross. He was a native of
Taunton, Somerset, England, and
his progenitors originally owned
“Bucklands,” an old Somersetshire
home and estate, which was lost to
the Stevens family a couple of gen-
erations before his birth. The wife
of James Stevens was born in
London, England, having been a
MR. F. J. STEVENS
member of a family named Sutton.
Tracing the history of the Stevens
family downwards we find it
recorded that the great-grandfather
of the owner of “Colton Vale” fol-
lowed the trade of a cooper in
London or its environs. The same
calling was pursued by James, and
later by his son Samuel in Australia,
and the former supported his family
as a cooper in Sydney until the year
1850, when the possibility of larger
opportunities in Brisbane—which
had been proclaimed a free settle-
ment some years before—and the
advice of relatives and friends who
had preceded him to the north,
caused him to remove his home to
the embryo though rapidly growing
town, the future capital of the then
unborn State of Queensland. He
arrived in Brisbane with his younger
children by a small schooner in the
year 1851, and from then on until
shortly before his death in 1866
continued to work at his trade. To

many years, during which he held
the position of contractor to the
Harbours and Rivers Department of
New South Wales for the building
of wooden buoys then used for
defining the different danger points
of the bays and rivers on her ex-
tended coastline. In 1859, when the
separation of Queensland from the
Mother State became an accom-
plished fact, he continued to carry
out similar contracts for the Queens-
land Government, but in 1866,
realizing that the cooperage trade
was on the decline owing to
the introduction of metal utensils
from England and other European
countries, he sold his business and
retired to the country, where, on a
property called “Homewood” —for
long a well-known landmark of
Coorparoo —he engaged in dairying
and general farming, conducting the
venture more as a hobby than a
purely financial concern. The late
David Hume, of Brisbane, who
shortly before had opened a branch
business at Mackay (and was after-
wards lost in the wreck of a trading
schooner off the Queensland coast),
was the purchaser of the assets and
goodwill of Mr. Stevens’ city busi-
ness, which, when relinquished by
the latter, was still in a good posi-
tion financially. Before his retire-
ment Mr. Stevens had been
approached in connection with the
manufacture of casks for the rum
trade, then obtaining a sound
footing in Queensland, but though
this promised lucrative business, he
refrained from engaging in any
undertaking associated with trade in
alcohol, of the evils of which he was
honestly and strongly convinced.
The xiprightness and integrity of his
dealings during his long career in
Brisbane did not fail to receive
recognition from the electors and
taxpayers of his time, by whom he
was repeatedly approached as a
possible candidate for municipal and
Parliamentary honours; bxxt only
once did he accede to a request of
this nature, the occasion being when
he opposed Mr. A. J. Hockings,
then retiring from the mayoralty, as
a candidate for membership in the
Council, with the result that, the
poll being a tie, Mr. Stevens retired
in favour of the late Mayor. Dur-
ing his lengthy residence in South
Brisbane he was prominent in fur-
thering the interests of the Congre-
gational Church, and in the middle
seventies occupied a deaconship in
connection with the Grey Street
congregation. But his strenuous life
had told on his constitution, and at
the comparatively early age of forty-
eight years he crossed the Great
Divide, mourned by his devoted wife
and a family of five sons and three
daughters, to whom he left a name
that was synonymous with upright-
ness in the minds of all with whom
he had dealings and which was held

Rosewood, his home electorate, in
the State Legislature. Mr. F. J.
Stevens, the present head of the
family, was educated under private


tuition at home, at the old Normal
School and at the National School,
South Brisbane. It is worthy of
note that, when still a child, his
efforts were called into public ser-
vice, for, under the advice and
direction of his father, he carried
round for signature the petitions
that were responsible for the open-
ing of the Alice Street Ferry and
the South Brisbane Recreation
Reserve, now known as St. Andrew’s
Park, institutions of over sixty
years’ standing. Terminating his
studies soon after entering his teens,
he became engaged with his father
at “Homewood,” where he was
his late twenties and persevering in
his original intention, he proceeded
to Mackay and entered upon the
duties of a post with Messrs. Sloane
and Co., owners of Alexandra Plant-
ation. On this estate, which at the
time was under the management of
Mr. John Ewen Davidson, he became
familiar in detail with all the pro-
cesses of sugar making, besides gain-
ing a very complete knowledge of
the different phases of operations
conducted on the plantation. In the
early eighties he was afforded the
opportunity of improving his posi-
tion by an offer of the oversight of
“Cassada” Plantation in the same
which he has been identified from its
infancy to the present time, when it
ranks as the chief sugar-producing
area of the State and Common-
wealth. The “Colton Vale” home-
stead lies twelve miles southerly
from Mackay and three miles from
Rosella, the nearest railway station,
and is of modern architecture. Its
grounds have been laid out with
good taste and are sheltered and
beautified by trees and ornamental
shrubs and flowers, among the larger
growths being well-grown mango and
orange trees and the beautiful
poinciana and silver wattle. Vines
add to its picturesque appearance,
given an insight into the agricultural
possibilities of the State. While
here he became impressed with the
importance of the sugar industry
and determined to make a special
study of this subject, as an initial
step securing a position on a Logan
River property owned by the late
Henry Jordan, who was then one of
the most representative cane farmers
and millers in Southern Queensland
and the pioneer of the “white man’s
industry” in the State. He had not

neighbourhood, and was engaged in
such capacity when his marriage
took place. This event naturally
proved to him an added incentive
to make a start in the industry on
his own account, to which end he
began to prepare and develop the
block of land—selected by him
shortly after his arrival in the
Mackay district—on which the
“Colton Yale” homestead now
stands. In the year 1884 he
entered into residence on the pro-
perty, which has continued his
headquarters for nearly forty out of
the forty-three years he has spent in
the district, with the development of
which is further enhanced by the
cane fields, which on two sides
approach within a short distance of
the homestead. The dwelling within
is pervaded by an atmosphere of
homeliness and refinement, and its
appointments are in keeping with
the orderliness which characterizes
the system of working out of doors,
and the various improvements which
mark the high stage of development
to which the whole property has been
brought. Mr. Stevens was created
a Justice of the Peace by the Philp
Administration in the early nineties.

JOHN DRYSDALE, J.P., “Pio-
neer House,” Pioneer, Northern
Queensland, was born in Kirkcaldy,
Fifeshire, on July 31, 1846, and is
the fourth son of the late John
MR. J. DRYSDALE.
Drysdale, a member of a Scottish
family of an antiquity which dates
back to the days which have left little
beyond minstrelsy or legends in the
way of historical data. The late
MR. G. R. DRYSDALE, SEN.
John Drysdale filled the position of
Sheriff Clerk of Lanarkshire during
the first half of the last century.
His son, Mr. John Drysdale, the
well - known mill proprietor of
Northern Queensland, was educated
at the historic Merchiston Castle
School, near Edinburgh, and on con-
cluding his studies there, entered the
office of the London engineering firm
of Willoughby Hemans, where he re-
ceived his practical training as a
civil engineer. For fifteen years
after gaining his diploma he prac-
tised his profession in Great Britain,
being engaged in railway work in
different parts of England, in the
West of Ireland —which was the
scene of most of his labours —and in
Asia, where he was engaged in pre-
liminary surveys for railways in the
Euphrates Valley, in Siam, and else-
where. His advent to Australia
occurred towards the end of 1886
and was prompted by the residence
here of a younger brother, the late
George Drysdale, the first of a
family to settle in the Southern
Continent and the possessor of im-
portant pastoral holdings in Vic-
toria. Somewhat prior to Mr. John
Drysdale’s arrival in the country
whose further development he was
destined to so materially assist, Mr.
George Drysdale had extended the
sphere of his landed operations to
Queensland, which was then attract-
ing considerable capital from Vic-
toria to its sugar areas. The latter
gentleman in conjunction with other
members of the family purchased
from Messrs. Spiller and Brandon,
who were among the original pion-
eers of the industry in the northern
part of the State, about 10,000 acres
of the excellent agricultural area
surrounding the Pioneer Mill, which
was then in course of erection, and,
in its incomplete state, included in
the purchase. He had practically
completed the mill when he was
joined by Mr. John Drysdale, who,
seeing the great possibilities of
investment here, entered into joart-
nership with his brother, the firm
thus established continuing to carry
on the cultivation of cane and the
manufacture of sugar for very many
years under the title of Drysdale
Bros. This title still stands as
representing the ownership of the
agricultural and pastoral areas in
which Mr. John Drysdale is inter-
ested, but some years ago the mills
were floated into a limited liability
company, and have been since car-
ried on under the title of “The
Pioneer Sugar Mills, Ltd.” Several
thousand acres surrounding the
sugar lands are depastured with
cattle and horses. Immediately after
his decision to identify himself with
sugar production in Queensland, Mr.
John Drysdale applied his profes-
sional knowledge and exceptional
administrative ability to the task of
getting the best possible results from

part of the State,
the Government of
the day purchased

further increase of
cane for consump-
tion by the Pioneer
Mill rapidly re-
sulted, rendering
urgently necessary
the erection of a
mill on the southern
side of the river, the
Pioneer occupying a site on the
northern side, ten miles from where
the Inkerman mill now stands.
Mr. Drysdale was approached by the
Government in this connection, with
the result that, in the year 1913, he
undertook the responsibility of erect-
ing the needed mill, his public-
spirited action being subsequently
recognized by the gubernatorial
authorities by a grant of 500 acres
for the furtherance of his enterprise.
The Inkerman ranks as the meet

Commonwealth, its crushing during
the harvesting season being esti-
mated at fully 5,000 tons of cane

amount crushed by the Pioneer,

manufactured by the two mills

far the greatest cane-producing area
in the Continent, the greater pro-
ductivity of the Ayr district being
due to the irrigation to which the
lands are subjected —a system which,
so far, has been paralleled nowhere
in the State. Though living a more
or less retired life socially, Mr. Drys-
dale strongly supports every move-
ment calculated to improve, the con-
ditions under which settlement is
carried forward, and many bodies
inaugurated in the causes of charity,
patriotism or other worthy motives,
have the benefit of his influence as
patron or president. He fills, also,
similar honorary office for various
bodies instituted in the interests of
clean sport. The passing years have
left little mark on a physique and
temperament essentially vigorous,
and the energy with which he directs
the work of production seems no less
than that which characterized his
earlier years. His regard for the
comfort of those engaged in mill
work is proverbial
and testified to by
well-built modern
cottages, comfort-

Mr. John Drysdale so prominently
figures are his brother Dr. Arthur
Drysdale and his nephew Mr. James
Drysdale. Dr. Drysdale who is a
director of the New Zealand and
Australian Land Company, has also
important pastoral interests here,
which necessitate periodical visits
from Dunfermline, Scotland, where
he now has his headquarters. After
many years spent in the practice of
medicine in Dunfermline, Scotland,
where he achieved distinction in his
profession, he spent a period with his
brother at Pioneer, eventually
returning to Great Britain. Mr.
James Drysdale carried out the
duties of manager at Pioneer dur-
ing a period that his uncle, Mr. John
Drysdale, was absent in England and
elsewhere, and proved equal to a
task which certainly calls for admin-
istrative ability of no mean order.

due course and entered upon the
duties of jackaroo with the idea of
gaining a good grounding in the
staple industry of the Continent.
The period spent at “Bangate”
resulted in his acquirement of con-

the ownership of Mr. G. Ritchie.

WILLIAM CRAIG, J.P., “New
Farm,” Brandon, Northern Queens-
land, was lorn in Raphoe, County
Donegal, Ireland, on November 22,
1862, and is a son of the late Wil-
liam Craig, who was a member of a
farming family which for several
generations had been settled iu the
North of Ireland. The late gentle-
man was manager of a banking insti-
tution in Raphoe, having at the same
time agrarian interests there. The
subject of this memoir received his
education at the Raphoe National
School, and on concluding his studies
entered the field of commercial ex-
perience by which he continued to
profit in his native town until the
year 1886, when he decided to test
the possibilities of the young con-
tinent under the Southern Cross,
which, he realized, must afford ex-
ceptional opportunities for a man
endowed with health and energy and
the will to succeed. Having all
these, and additional qualifications,
his decision was shortly followed by
his embarkation on the vessel which
was to convey him from the Old
World to Sydney, where almost
immediately he became engaged in
commerce, continuing to be thus
occupied until 1889, when his ser-
vices were secured by the well-known
firm of A. McArthur & Co., im-
porters, who appointed him to take
charge of the Townsville branch of
their business. For the following
three years he carried out the duties

agriculture. For some time he has
been rightly regarded as one of the
most successful producers of cane in
the Ayr district, his farm of 120
acres yielding annually (from two-
thirds of the area closely tilled, the
remainder being allowed to lie
fallow) about 3,000 tons. He has
interests apart from agriculture,
among which ranks the breeding of
equine stock. In this phase of the
grazing industry he has been emin-
ently successful, scoring honours as
an exhibitor at the Townsville
and other show rings of the
North. Since his advent to the
Burdekin district, some thirty years
ago, he has continued to give ample
proof of his public-spiritedness,
among the bodies which have formed
the basis of much of his activity
being the Ayr Shire Council, of
which he was at one time chairman
and a member for over a decade, the
Lower Burdekin Pastoral, Agricul-
tural, and Industrial Society, of
which for the past eight years he has
been president, and which he
assisted in founding and served as its
first secretary, and for several years
as a committeeman, and the Far-
mers’ Association, of which he has
also been chairman. He is pro-
gressive in politics, keenly patriotic,
and has the interests of his adopted
country very much at heart. His
efforts for the encouragement of
various forms of industrial enterprise
have as their chief objective the
stimulation of an interest in the Ayr
annual exhibitions, and his work in
this connection has accomplished
much for the district and com-
munity. He has been a prime mover,
also, among those responsible for the
advancement of clean sport in the
locality, and at time of wilting fills
the office of chairman of the Lower
Burdekin Turf Club. For twenty
years he has exercised the Commis-
sion of the Peace, having been
gazetted to that office by the Philp
Administration. In the year 1900 he

FREDERICK GEORGE MAR-
GETTS, J.P., “Holme Farm,” Bran-
don, Northern Queensland, was born
in the year 1847 at Holme Fenn, on
the border of Huntingdonshire,
where his forbears of many successive
generations had been agrarian land-
owners and actively identified with
the industry. He is a son of the late
Edmund Margetts, who made his
advent to Australia when the sub-
ject of this memoir was a child, and
became prominent among the public
officials of his day. Mr. Edmund
Margetts was the first postmaster in
Warrnambool and here Mr. F. G.
Margetts received his education and
made his entry into commercial life,
which he followed in Victoria until
1873, when, proceeding to Port Dar-
win, he acquired part-ownership of
a schooner for trade with Timor. At
this period began those varying
vicissitudes which marked an active
career of some forty years, his trad-
ing experiences from the Gulf subse-
quently giving place to others,
equally exciting, on the early gold-
fields. He followed the mining
industry on the Palmer and Hodg-
kinson fields for two years ere
meagre results prompted him to try
his luck at Charters Towers, which
yielded him no better success.
Turning his attention, therefore, to
land prospecting, he explored and
discovered some good pastoral areas.
At about this time his varied exper-
ience of conditions then existing in
the bush and on the mining fields
singled him out as fitted for a
order in times when natives were
truculent and many of the whites
needed the curb of a firm hand. In
the eighties he resigned from the
Police service to take over the man-
agement of the Lankelly gold mine

quished to join Mr. R. A. Wakeford,
Townsville, in an auctioneering busi-
ness with which he continued to be
associated until 1901, when the part-
nership, which had been carried on
under the title of Margetts & Wake-
ford, was dissolved by mutual con-
sent. Thereafter, Mr. Margetts
the cyanide process for the follow-
ing eight years. At the end of that
period, desiring a life which called
for less physical and mental strain
than had hitherto accompanied his
exertions, he invested in “Holme
Farm/’ a sugar property in the vicin-
ity of Ayr, to the conduct of which
he has since devoted himself. In the
responsible positions which he has
occupied at different times he has
displayed a keen interest in the vari-
ous movements tending to progres-
sive industrial development, and has
been prominently identified with
farmers’ associations and such bodies
as the Townsville Turf Club, of
which he was on the committee for
several years, and the Lower Burde-
kin Pastoral, Agricultural, and
Industrial Association, of which he
is a vice-president. He was created
a Justice of the Peace in the early
nineties, under the Mcllwraith Ad-
ministration. Mr. Margetts is a Past
Master of the Masonic Fraternity
and P.D.S.G.W. of the English Con-
stitution. He is an enthusiastic sup-
porter of the “sport of Kings’’ and is
to the fore among the citizens of the
district who aim to keep sport clean.
In the year 1894, he married Mar-
garet, daughter of the late Andrew
Andrews and widow of Mr. John
Turner of “Grantham,” a well-
known pastoralist in his day. Mrs.
Margetts died in the year 1917. Her

fortunes abroad. Choosing Austra-

he set sail by the “Earl of Gran-

to the canefields outlyiuo- the latter

was offered the position of overseer
of field work for the Pioneer Estate
which, accepting, he continued to

years, his resignation being at last
prompted by an opportunity afforded

on his own account. From Mr.
Drysdale, who has thus indirectly es-
tablished many others in the indus-
try, and to whom Mr. McLaughlin
gives full credit for the success which
such an opportunity made possible, he
leased a block of land which he
devoted to cane culture for a period
of eight years, at the end of which
he found himself in the position to
purchase from Mr. Holmes, who was
then retiring from active connection
with the industry, “Acacia Field,”
the present centre of his activities.
Since then he has gradually enlarged
the scope of his landed operations,
acquiring agricultural and grazing
blocks in different parts of the
Burdekin watershed, which aggre-
gate an acreage in the vicinity of
3,000. His personal efforts are
almost entirely devoted to sugar
production, and it is to intelligently
applied industry, backed up by the
active support, encouragement and
self-sacrifice of Mrs. McLaughlin,
and her unswerving faith in his
ability, that his present success is
due. Of a retiring disposition, he
avoids the limelight of public life
though he generously supports all
those movements which have been
instituted for the good of the public,
particularly such as are suggested by
charity or patriotism. He married
in the year 1890 Margaret, daughter
of the late Robert Johnston, who was
a member of a family which,
though claiming descent from both
English and Scottish stock, was for
long identified with farming pur-
suits in County Monaghan, Ireland,
and finally settled to agricultural
life in the South of Scotland. Of
the union there is a family of two
sons and one daughter. Of the sons,
the eldest, Richard, was born on
July 22, 1896, in the home attached
to Mr. Robert McLaughlin’s first
independently owned property on
the Burdekin, this holding being yet
in his possession. Mr. Richard Me-

locally until about 13 years of age;
he then went to the Townsville
Grammar School, where he contin-

the Australian Imperial Forces, the
date of his enlistment being May 7,
1918. Some weeks later he was on
his way to the scene of action, but
his keen desire of sharing the brunt
of service in the firing line with the
brave and resourceful men whom his
country had sent to defend the
Empire, was destined to remain
unfulfilled, for very shortly after his
arrival in Egypt, the Armistice was
signed. In due course he returned

Napoleonic Wars, eventually, as a
result of these wars, settled in Ger-
many, where one of its branches was
represented by the late gentleman in
the early sixties. The very trying
conditions prevailing in Europe at
that period caused Mr. F. C. Payard
to long for a land where peaceful
settlement was possible, and having
heard of the great potentialities of
Australia and being particularly im-
pressed by accounts of thetremendous
pastoral resources of the then infant
Colony of Queensland, he decided to
make a home for his family under
the Southern Cross. He accordingly
set out with his wife and children
on the long voyage from Europe,
and in due course landed in Bris-
bane, where he remained for a short
time ere gaining some familiarity
with his new surroundings and a
knowledge of the industrial condi-
tions and possibilities of the country
in which he was destined to spend
the many remaining years of his life.
Arriving in the Queensland capital
at about the time of the foundation
of Bowen (1861), he proceeded very
shortly afterwards to the new
township, and from there secured
employment on a pastoral property
in its vicinity. From then onwards, for
a year or so, he supported his family
as an employe in the great industry
which was then being pioneered in
the North, one of his first chiefs
being the late Robert Towns, who
was so prominently concerned in the
foundation of Townsville and after
whom that now busy and thriving
centre was named. Before very long
he was in a position to start indepen-
dently as a station-building contrac-
tor, in which capacity he was con-
stantly employed with his staff in
erecting fences and those rough
though solid and often comfortable
structures which served the pioneer
pastoralists as homesteads. After
many work-filled years crowned with
MR. W. F. A. PAYAED.
incidents that, if only recorded as
they occurred, would have formed
intensely interesting reading at the
present day, he entered upon a life
of partial retirement on his son’s
property, “Waterview,” where his
experience and practical help were
of much service in the early forma-
tion of that property as a sugar and
cattle-growing venture. Mr. W. F.
A. Payard was educated at Bowen.
At an early age he was attracted to
the land as a calling, feeling strongly
that his temperament was more
suited to an outdoor life than to a
city occupation, though fully recog-
nizing with his father (who was anx-
ious for him thus to carve a career)
the possibilities of retail trade at the
time. His first essay into pastoral
life was made when, at the age of
fourteen, he became one of a droving
party. From the second year of his
teens onwards he continued to follow
the grazing industry in its various
phases, eventually securing employ-
ment on a dairying proposition in
the Bowen district. This experience
was followed by his acquirement of
land on Charters Towers, then a
newly discovered goldfield. This
land he devoted to dairying from
1873 to 1876, in .the latter year
disposing of it and settling near the
site of Ayr, then not existent as a
township, as in neither this now
thriving centre nor the neighbour-
ing township, Brandon, had a single
house been then erected. Both
“Waterview” and the country which
is now “Jarvisfield,” he acquired
simultaneously, leasing the latter
area from Mr. A. C. Macmillan, the
father of the present owner of “Loch-
invar.” On both areas he inaugur-
ated dairying operations, in those
early days milking sometimes 100
cows and manufacturing a large
quantity of butter, which it was his
custom to convey once a month to
Charters Towers, then the only avail-
able market for the commodity. His
operations at this time when scien-
tific appliances, in the shape of mach-
inery, etc., were yet things of the
future—involved very strenuous
MR. H. A. PAYAED.
exertion, while the marketing of his
produce entailed travelling 180 miles
to Charters Towers and back with
three horses and a dray over almost
impassable roads. After a time he
gave up the land which he leased


from Mr. Macmillan and settled per-
manently on his own block, which
then embraced only 220 acres, but
which, by further acquirements, he
eventually extended until the boun-
daries of the farm embraced an acre-
age of 2,000. In addition to
“Waterview" he has other large
landed interests in the Ayr district,
and at one time owned “Chiverton,”
a property now in the possession of
Mr. Harry Cox. At “Waterview"
he initiated in due course, grazing
and agricultural operations on a
large scale, specializing in corn-grow-
ing and very considerably increasing
his dairy output. He was for several
years the most successful corn grower
in the district, his property averag-
ing a larger yield than the combined
efforts of the other growers produced
annually in the same period. When
the establishment and working of the
Pioneer Mill by Mr. Drysdale proved
the possibilities of sugar-growing in
the Ayr district, he devoted such of
his lands as he realized were espec-
ially suitable for the culture of cane
to this industry, in which under
indentured labour he proved as
successful as in other forms of agri-
culture, harvesting a good yield
from 600 acres, and becoming known
in fact, as one of the largest sugar
planters in the locality. When the

commodities, having in addition con-
siderable interests in other forms of
pastoral enterprise. In all his under-
takings he keeps abreast of the times,
large airy rooms which receive
illumination from a gas installation
attached to the dwelling, and is one
of the most modernly designed and
appointed in Northern Queensland,
its site being on a bank of a perman-
ent lagoon. Possessing wide balconies
and verandahs it overlooks extensive
grounds which are adorned with
shade trees, shrubs, and blooms, and
include ferneries in which a variety
of choice plants and delicate green-
eries are cultivated. Though so
keenly interested in the industries to
which he has given the beet part of
his life, he yet finds time to devote
to communal business and the vari-
ous movements instituted for the
public weal. He is one of the first
members of the Ayr Shire Council,
having as an alderman served the
ratepayers for several years. At the
time of writing he is vice-president
of the Lower Burdekin Pastoral
and Agricultural Society, and a
prominent member of the Lower
Burdekin Farming Association.
It would be safe to say that
almost every movement of a charit-
able or patriotic nature that has
existed since he first assumed large
responsibilities in this district, has
received his support, and in such
matters he has invariably availed
himself of the practical assistance

January 6, 1894, respectively, and
educated at Nudgee College, Bris-

their scholastic careers, became
engaged in the work and adminis-
tration of the property, and, since,
have continued to thus assist their

EDWARD CHARLES BIGGS.
“Mona,” Halifax, Northern Queens-
land, is the second son of the
late William Biggs, who was a
well-1 mown resident of Newport,

builder and contractor in a large
way. The branch of the Biggs family
to which the subject of this memoir
owes his descent had been established
MR. G. BIGGS.
in Newport generations before that
which witnessed his own birth, which
occurred there on December 20,
1861, the foundation of the family
being in Somerset, England. At
Newport he was primarily educated,
a secondary course of study being
afforded him at Parker’s Academy,
Lichfield, Staffordshire, where he
completed his school career when in
his early teens. From college he
entered the building trade under his
father, whom he continued to assist,
while making a speciality of car-
pentry, until he was at the age of
twenty. Realizing then that a
young country provides the best of
all fields for a young man’s energy
and holds out greater promise for
those who would attain indepen-
dence, and are able and willing to
work for it, he bade farewell to old
associations, severed old ties and
embarked for Australia. In Novem-
ber 1882, he landed with some ship-
mates in Townsville, it being then his
intention to continue the voyage to
Brisbane, to which city his passage
was booked. Not returning to the
vessel until after time of sailing,
however, he was forced to break his
journey, and thereupon decided to
settle in the Northern town, which
at that time was about fifteen years
old and the first port of call on the
route by which he had travelled.
Immediately telegraphing to Bowen,
the next port at which the vessel
touched, he had his possessions landed
there and sent on to him at Towns-
ville, where he secured work at his
trade in connection with the erection
uf the office and stores of Messrs.
Aplin Bros. He celebrated his
twenty-first birthday shortly after
his arrival, and, on the suggestion
of the late Mr. Scott —who was
then engaged in the management of
Aplin Bros.-—obtained the post of
carpenter at the Macknade Mill on
the Herbert River. Entering upon
his new duties in February of the
year 1883, he continued as the mill
carpenter for the following four
years, at the end of which period an
opportunity occurred whereby he
was enabled to embark on a landed
venture on a freehold block which he
acquired in the vicinity of Halifax
in a locality known as the Four Mile,
in partnership with three others.
“Springfield” was the name of the
holding, and it consisted of 1,280
acres, which Mr. Biggs developed as
a cattle-breeding proposition chiefly,
although he cleared and devoted a
portion of it to cane, having some
fifty acres under the plant at the
end of his fifth year of possession,
when, about 1894, he was overtaken
by most serious disaster due to a
grass fire, which, during his absence
from home on business connected
with stock, swept the whole run,
reducing to ashes his crop, yards,
stables, outhouses and other effects.

country, he was again obliged to seek
employment from others, and, re-
turning to Macknade, was installed
in his old post as mill carpenter,
which he held for the following three


years. While at Macknade he sold
"Springfield,” and, on relinquishing
his position there, took up a farm on
the Macknade Estate which he
named “Newport” after his old
home in England. Subsequently, he
sold “Newport” to Mr. Walter
Blackman, from whom it passed to
the present owner. In 1903, he
purchased “Mona” from the Com-
mercial Banking Co. of Sydney, and

For a time, also, Mr. Beatts held a
position as overseer in the sugar in-
dustry when the product was grown
and manufactured chiefly by the aid
of kanaka labour. Mr. Biggs’
family consisted of thirteen, of whom
three sons and seven daughters sur-
vive, five of the latter being married

The late ARTHUR WILLIAM
CARR, "Oakleigh,” Halifax, North-
ern Queensland. Of the pioneers
responsible for the settlement of the
MR. A. W. CARR.
Herbert district, few deserve greater
honour than is due to the late
Arthur William Carr. An English-
man, he was descended from a
family, which, for generations, had
been represented in the commercial
life of the Motherland, chiefly in
trade, though a banking career in
Manchester occupied the early years
of the pioneer. He left Manchester
for Australia nearly fifty years ago,
having been attracted hither by the
prospect of greater achievement than
would be possible in the Old \\ orld,
where, for the majority of intelligent
workers, future independence seemed
vague and unattainable owing to
keen competition and limited oppor-
tunities. Shortly after his arrival he
proceeded to the Logan district, and
became engaged in sugar-growing.
Having exchanged the comparative
ease and luxury of an advanced civ-
ilization for the primitive conditions
of a country yet in the making,
he determined that no undertaking,
however difficult, should debar him
from the ultimate attainment of his
ambition, and for a year he put his
best efforts into the industry in
Southern Queensland. Finally decid-
ing to settle further north, he
travelled to the district outlying the
present town of Cardwell, having as
companions two friends, Messrs.
William and Alfred Jay (now also
deceased), in conjunction with whom
he took up land for sugar-growing
on a watercourse known as Saltwater
Creek. The block proved unsuitable
for their purpose, and failure re-
quited the partners’ efforts, which
were further hampered by the
severe form of malaria from which
they suffered. Convinced that no
tangible results would be obtained
by carrying on here, they abandoned
the place, and, shouldering their
swags, sought a new district in which
to make a start. The late A. W.
Carr eventually secured employment
MR. J. E. CARR.
at Macknade as overseer at the
sugar mill there, having under him a
large staff of kanakas. After a
period thus employed he took up the
land now well known in the district
as “Oakleigh” and conducted by his
four sons. This property he immed-
iately developed for agriculture, and
for a period did exceedingly well by
growing corn and potatoes to supply
the mill hands. When the sugar in-
dustry expanded and the Victoria
Mill was erected, he put his land
under cane, and for the remainder
of his life carried on as one of the
representative farmers of the dis-
trict, wherein his public activities
covered a large sphere and were
considerable factors in the direction
of progress. Under the then existing
system of local Government he ren-
dered good service as a member of
the Hinchinbrook Divisional Board ;
he was among those instrumental in
establishing the first school in Hali-
fax, of the board of which he was a
committeeman; and he was one of
the guarantors for the erection of
the first Church of England in the
town. He also cut the road from
Halifax to Conn’s Grossing, which
was a great boon to bush travellers
of the period. In 1905, he enlarged
the scope of his operations by open-
ing a general store in Cordelia,
where he continued to follow com-
mercial pursuits in conjunction with
his sugar venture until the time of
his death. The late gentleman was
a broadminded and kindly character,
extremely charitable, and a good
sport. As a rifle shot he was a Queen’s
Prize man and proved his worth at
the meetings of many of the lead-
ing clubs of the State held in his day.
Mr. Carr married in the year 1879,
Susannah, daughter of the late
Charles James Jay, a member of an
old Suffolk family. Typical of the
women whose fine sacrifices and
whose cheerfulness in the face of
solitude, hardship, and loss, helped

to lay up a noble heritage for Aus-
tralian womanhood of all time, Mrs.
Carr proved a worthy helpmeet to
her pioneer husband. Her family

latter are Mesdames A. Isaacs, P.

the sons, the eldest conducts a
motor business in Halifax. The four
younger, John Edward, Arthur
Percy, Edgar Norman and Charles
Roland, jointly conduct “Oakleigh,”
the property devoted to cane culture
which passed to them from their late
father. All served their country
during the progress of the great-
struggle which devastated Europe
and the East during the latter half
of the last decade of the present
century, three having embarked for
the Front in 1915 as members of the
Light Horse, and continued in
action for the full term of the hos-
tilities. These brothers, Arthur
Percy, Edgar Norman and Charles
Roland, served together in Gallipoli,

PEARSON, “Brooklands,” Halifax,
Northern Queensland, is the only
surviving son of the late Daniel
Pearson, who, until the year 1921,
THE LATE J. PEARSON.
lived as one of the oldest pioneers of
the sugar industry on the Herbert
River. Descended from a very old
Kentish family, which for centuries
had been identified with, pastoral
enterprise in and around Appledore,
where its representatives of successive
generations engaged in sheep farm-
ing, the late gentleman inherited a
temperament which prompted him to
seek opportunities of proprietorship
in a country whose greatest need was,
and still is, men of his calibre to
develop resources that, hidden in the
heart of nature, need but enterprise
and industry to provide competence
for millions. His realization of the
wonderful potentialities of Australia
was shortly followed, when still a
young man, by his embarkation for
Queensland, where in due course he
arrived and became associated with
the late Robert Christensen, the
founder of “Lammermoor” Station,
and formerly one of the best-known
pastor a lists of the State. He spent
some time at “Lammermoor,” where
he gained considerable experience of
the methods of conducting a cattle
proposition with one of the most
progressive stock-owners that the
State has to thank for her develop-
ment. The year 1883 witnessed his
arrival in the Herbert district,
where, in Ingham, he established a
butchery which he worked up into a
successful business and personally
conducted for two and a half years.
Selling out in 1886, he embarked on
a voyage to his native land, and dur-
ing the twelve months of his absence
renewed, old acquaintances, visited
old scenes and various places of
historic interest in the Old World. On
his return, purchasing the business
which he had founded three years
before, he again devoted his energies
to its administration, during the
several years he was thus engaged
tranferring his interests from East to
West Ingham on the site now covered
by the “Express” Newspaper office.
Subsequently, he disposed of this
business and purchased “Brook-
lands,” the property now conducted

by his son. At “Brooklands” he
also established a butchery, combin-
ing for some time the trade which
he had so long followed with cane
farming. His interests included,
also, a butchery at Halifax. He was
always fully alive to the interests of
the district in which the lines of his
life were cast, among the bodies
which owe their existence chiefly to
his energy and foresight being the
Herbert River Pastoral and Agricul-
tural Association, to establish which
he spared neither time nor trouble,
and of which he was appointed vice-
president on three consecutive occa-
sions. Under the old system of local
Government he was for a number of
years a member of the Shire Council,
then known as the Hinchinbrook
Divisional Board. Of the Herbert
River Jockey Club he was a member
of very long standing, a short time
previous to his death having been
appointed judge for the then forth-
coming meeting, the duties of which
position he was prevented from
carrying out, however, owing to his
illness. He adjudicated at numerous
meetings of the Halifax Racing
Club, which included him amongst its
members for some years. Mr. Pear-
son was one of the founders of Free-
masonry on the Herbert, and his
death, which occurred in his sixty-
eighth year, deprived the district of
one of its most upright citizens. In
the year 1890 he married Agnes
Therese, daughter of the late John
Sullivan, who, of Irish birth and a
member of a family whose name
speaks sufficiently of its antiquity,
settled in Australia when the coun-
try was yet in its infant days. Mr.
Sullivan was a well-known builder
and contractor of Southern Queens-
land, and in the early chronicles of
Drayton much of his work is
recorded. To the late Daniel Pear-
son and his wife were born three
sons and two daughters, of whom a
son and daughter survive. The
latter, Dallas Algenia, resides with
her mother in the old home made for
them by the pioneer, and Mr. R. V.
MR. D. PEARSON.
G. Pearson resides with his wife and
family in a cottage home adjoining
the older dwelling. Born in Ingham
on October 20, 1891, and educated
at the Normal School, Brisbane, and


the Townsville Grammar School, Mr.
Pearson entered upon the study of
pastoral subjects at the Gatton

The late ISAAC HENRY, a
pioneer of New South Wales and
Queensland, and a descendant of a
very old Scottish family, was the
son of John Henry, who, though
MR. I. HENRY.
trained for a clerical career as a
minister of the Presbyterian Church,
and thus assured of a living at home,
acted on the conviction that his
vocation lay in a more active calling,
and his desire to carve his destiny
in the then little-known Continent of
Australia led to his embarking with
his family for Sydney in the ship
“William Roger,” which sailed from
Greenock on May 19, 1838, reaching
its destination on December 23 of
the same year. During the voyage
smallpox broke out, and, on the
vessel’s arrival in Australian waters,
it was detained at the quarantine
station for the prescribed period,
during which Isaac Henry was born.
John Henry quickly found scope for
his energies in the new land, and
went into the timber trade, for some
time conducting a sawmill in the
Illawarra district of New South
Wales. He died in the middle forties
when he had been but a few years
in the country. Isaac Henry first
faced the realities of life as a wage-
earner before he was ten, when he
was employed by his elder brother to
assist with the bullock teams with
which the latter was at that time
operating,as a carrier. As time went
on he was able to take his share of
the hard work and fare of a bushman
of the times, and when still a lad in
his teens saw much of life at the
early goldfields. For a number of
years his quest of the yellow metal
led him to visit different gold-bearing
centres of New South Wales and Vic-
toria, and, finally, New Zealand,
where he engaged in mining for three
years. In 1869 he returned to the
Mother Colony and interested him-
self in farming pursuits for a period,
eventually proceeding with his young
wife to Southern Queensland, where,
making a home on the Logan, he
resided until 1879. In ihis year he
joined the late James Tyson and
Edward Hewitt (uncle and brother,
respectively, of Mrs. Henry) in a
Northern Queensland venture in the
district outlying Cardwell, where the
trio took up large areas of country

tions. They put a considerable
acreage under cane, but, though pro-
ducing a splendid crop, proceeded no
further in this direction owing to a
combination of circumstances, the
final and deciding factor which deter-
mined them to relinquish sugar in
favour of stock-growing being the
legislation against kanaka labour.
After a short interval, Mr. Hewitt
withdrew from the connection, and
Mr. Tyson, though retaining his
land, returned to the South. Mr.
Henry remained to justify his faith
in the possibilities of the district—a
faith to which he held in the face
of many trials—and proceeded with
the work of development, devoting
his run to breeding and fattening
cattle. As, by sheer hard work and
perseverance, he wrested from the
bush comparative prosperity, he
acquired additional country, and in
course of time became one of the best-
known pastoralists of the district
with whose progress he had been so
closely identified. The fine old home
is situated 20 miles from Cardwell
in the midst of far-stretching free-
hold pastoral lands, and is sur-
rounded by well-kept grounds laid
out into lawns, flower beds, and
citrus orchards, and carrying many
other varieties of fruit trees. Despite
a career of excessive arduousness, he
lived to the age of eighty-four and
retained his fine bodily and mental
vigour to the end, remaining in har-
ness up to his eighty-third year, when
he undertook his last droving trip.
His strong, kindly, and interesting
personality, his gifts as a raconteur,
his capacity for work, and other
fine characteristics will live long in
the memories of those who had the
privilege of his acquaintance. Card-
well and its district owes much to
his energy as a member of the local
Shire Council, of which he was
chairman for many years. He mar-
ried in the year 1869 Barbara

three sons and two daughters, and
nobly shared the difficulties, dangers,

and sacrifices of his career, making
homelike the grass hut which first
served them for a dwelling, bravely
facing with her young children the
solitude of the bush when duty


called the menfolk elsewhere, and at
times being obliged to repel the
blacks by a brave front with the
realization that her only hope of
safety lay in the display and, pos-
sibly, the use of firearms. As the
years passed on she proved an
equally resourceful comrade and a
wise advisor when prosperity followed
on the hard times, and now, in her
eighty-fourth year, from the shelter
of the beautiful old home which the
pioneer made for her at “Bellen-
den,” may look back upon a life
which has benefited the country to
no small degree and given to it a
family that has a noble example of
citizenship from which to profit. The
late Isaac Henry died at “Bellen-
den” on March 21, 1922. Of his
sons, the eldest, William, died in
the year 1907. The next in age, Mr.
Brice Henry, J.P., is the owner of
“Wooroora,” near Ravenshoe, and
one of the most energetic and pro-
gressive citizens of the district, many
of the movements that make for com-
munal progress having emanated
from his efforts. He has for long
fulfilled the functions of chairman of
the Cardwell Shire Council, in which
office he succeeded his father when
the latter retired from active pur-
suits. At time of writing he is using
his influence in the direction of
further developing the district’s
resources. He is taking part in the
movement for the erection of a
sugar mill in the Tully and Banyan
districts. This mill would make the
district one of the most prosperous
in Queensland. The youngest son of
the pioneer, Hugh Henry, 8.A.,
LL.B., was admitted to the Bar in
New South Wales in 1907. In 1909
he was admitted to the Queensland
Bar. He practised in Brisbane till
1914, when he returned to “Bellen-
den,” and has since devoted his
energies to the work and adminis-
tration of the place. Both the late
gentleman’s daughters rendered dis-
tinguished service at the War theatres
during 1914-18. Miss Barbara Henry,
St.J.A.A., saw service in different
parts of England as a member of the
Voluntary Aid Detachment. Her
sister, Elizabeth Henry, A.T.N.A.,
volunteered on the outbreak of war.
Her services were accepted as a sister
in the Australian Nursing Service.
For three years she was stationed at
Rabaul. Later she was appointed
matron in the Indian Transport Ser-
vice from Bombay to Marseilles.
“BELLENDEN” HOMESTEAD.


Among the pioneers whose mem-
ories it is our privilege to perpetuate
through these pages, none have more
worthily deserved the regard of pos-
terity than the late THOMAS
THE LATE T. H. FITZ-GERALD.
HENRY FITZ-GERALD. The
holder of diplomas as an architect,
a civil engineer, and a surveyor, he
devoted the early years of his man-
hood to professional work in New
Zealand, where he also carried out
the duties of superintendent under
the system of provincial government
then existing, and figured promin-
ently in political life. He came to
Queensland in the fifties and took
no small part in the negotiations
which preceded the granting to the
present State a constitution, and
afterwards took his place in Parlia-
ment, early in the sixties represent-
ing the Kennedy. His professional
duties took him over different parts
of the then Colony, and in 1864 he
is recorded as having completed, as
Government surveyor of the Ken-
nedy district, the survey of the
road over the range to the infant
settlement of Mackay, of which in
the sixties he was one of the most
influential and progressive citizens.
Shortly after finishing the survey of
the town and surrounding country,
his large experiments in sugar cul-
ture earned for him recognition as
the founder of the industry north
of Maryborough, for towards the end
of 1865, at about the same time as
Mr. Spiller experimented, he planted
a large consignment of cane, and
conclusively proved the district’s
possibilities as a future sugar centre.
Two years later, in conjunction with
Mr. J. Ewen Davidson, he had the
Alexandra Mill erected and in-
augurated the first crushing opera-
tions effected in Northern Queens-
land. He later built and owned the
“Meadowlands” and “Tekowai”
Mills, and was on the point of erect-
ing the “Peri” when the fatal visi-
tation known as the “rust” ruined
all the crops of the Pioneer water-
shed and many capitalists whose
assets had been solely devoted to the
industry. While largely interested
in sugar-growing and manufacture
in Mackay, Mr. Fitz-Gerald identi-
fied himself with Parliamentary life
in Brisbane, holding a portfolio as
Colonial Treasurer in the Lilley

Ministry for a short period. His
name appears in the list of thirty-
two members comprising the fourth
Parliament, opened November 17,
1868, and on the formation, as a
result of the Electoral Act of 1872,
of the Bowen electorate, which in-
cluded Mackay within its bound-
aries, he acted as its representative
in the first and second sessions of
the seventh Parliament, opened on
January 6, 1874. The losses sus-
tained through the “rust” outbreak
in Mackay caused a temporary cessa-
tion in his industrial activities, and
for a time he devoted himself exclu-
sively to his profession. In 1879,
the pioneering spirit again urged
him to the scenes of practically un-
known regions, and to form a further
idea of the possibilities of the
tract so favourably reported upon
by Lieutenant Dalrymple, he
equipped at his own expense a small
craft, and forming a party, pro-
spected all the coastal rivers and
creeks between Townsville and Cook-
town, and explored the vast areas of
country that are now richly pro-
ducing sugar lands. He was most
favourably impressed with the
possibilities of the Johnstone River
watershed, of the fertility of which
he had previously been informed by
Sub-Inspector Johnstone, its dis-
coverer, and which he navigated as
far as possible, finding its banks
dense jungles of lawyer cane and
very difficult of penetration for
survey purposes. By means of a log
line he, nevertheless, managed to
make a fairly correct map, from
which all the earlier selections of
the Innisfail district were appor-
tioned and outlined. On his return
from a trip that was successfully
accomplished in spite of many
extreme dangers, hardships, and
disabilities he did his utmost to
enlist through the Brisbane Press
public interest in the possibilities of
the now thriving cane district of the
Johnstone, but, as usual in such
cases, opposition to his schemes pre-
ponderated. Finding it impossible to
secure co-operation in other quarters,
MR. T. H. FITZ-GERALD.
he appealed to a personal friend,
the Right Rev. Doctor O’Quinn,
who is remembered by those who
had the privilege of his acquaint-
ance as a man of considerable


foresight. Doctor O’Quinn and
other friends practically seconded his
efforts, and early in 1880 Mr. Fitz-
Gerald made arrangements for the
Queensland Steamship Go’s steamer
“Corea” to carry his party of pro-
spective settlers to their destination.
On April 22 of the same year the
“Corea” dropped anchor off the
Johnstone bar, where she was met
by Sub-Inspector Johnstone in his
launch, and the following day her
passengers (among them being Mr.
Fitz-Gerald’s son Thomas, then
about nineteen years old), and their
equipment of boats, building
materials, provisions, and other
necessaries, were landed at a spot
named Flying Fish Point, which,
like the rest of this country, was
almost impenetrable scrub to the
“Innisfail,” called by Mr. Fitz-
Gerald after a beauty spot in Ire-
land, and which later became the
designation of the town when its
name was changed from Geraldton
to avoid confusion with the Western
Australian town of that name, was
the first plantation cleared. Settle-
ment progressed slowly until the first
crop of the Johnstone River sugar,
crushed in the small mill which he
had erected at “Innisfail,” was
placed on the market, thus proving
that cane grown on these rich
tropical lands would produce sugar
profitably. Further development
followed, and the little town of
Fitz-Geraldton, abbreviated to
Geraldton, as it was originally
named by the Surveyor-General of
the day, entered upon its first era of

Devoy, of Brisbane. Of the sons,
the Rev. Father Henry Fitz-Gerald

Catholic Church in the metropolis;
another, the late James Francis
Fitz-Gerald, was formerly a well-
known solicitor of the city; a third,
Mr. Charles B. Fitz-Gerald, was a
barrister of Western Queensland,
and for some years member for the

Fitz-Gerald, was a mining surveyor.
Two, the Messrs. FITZ-GERALD
BROS., of Innisfail, are engaged in
sugar production on the Johnstone
River. Of these, JOHN PATRICK

ing son, was born in Napier, New
Zealand, on December 27, 1858.

their goods under shelter when com-

of continuous rain for which the

hardships which accompanied the

formed when it is mentioned that

prosperity. On November 10, 1888,
the fine old pioneer passed away,
death being due to the effects of
malaria contracted years previously.
His wife was Jessie, daughter of
Mr. James Wilson, who for many
years represented Wanganui in the
New Zealand Parliament, and his
family consisted of eight sons and
three daughters. Mrs. Fitz-Gerald,
whose death occurred on June 27,
1901, shared her husband’s earlier
pioneering experiences in the
Mackay district, but indifferent
health prevented her participation
in the early settlement of the John-
stone River. Of her daughters, two
entered religious life, one as a
Sister of Mercy of All Hallows Con-
vent, Brisbane, and the other as a
Sister of Charity in Hobart. The
pioneer settled in Australia, where,
at St. Patricks College, Melbourne,
his earlier education was conducted,
With his brother, Thomas Henry,
his later studies were pursued at St.
Mary’s College, Dundalk, Ireland,
and at Institution St. Joseph, Mont
Lucon, France, whence, early in
1881, he returned to Queensland,
For some months he studied law in
Brisbane, but the call of the life to
which his father had devoted him-
self was strongly felt by the son also,
causing him to relinquish the chance
of a legal career, and in July of the
same year to join the elder gentle-
man at “Innisfail.” Here he
gained Ins fust expenence of the
culture and manufacture of sugar,
and continued to engage in the in-
dustry until the pioneer’s enterprise


was checked by the great depression
which followed the abolition of black
labour, the introduction of beet
sugar, and other adverse conditions.
Mr. J. P. Fitz-Gerald received from
his father a farm on “Redcliffe,”
the property taken up in his name
in the early eighties, and which has
continued to be his home since the
year 1884. When sugar became un-
profitable he devoted the area to
maize, bananas, and other tropical
fruits, but on account of poor mar-
kets had a hard struggle for many
years, during which he prospected a
good deal of the country at the back
of the town. In the year 1910, when
the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.
erected a bridge over the Johnstone
River, he returned to the sugar in-
dustry, and has since been con-
tinuously engaged in cane produc-
tion, harvesting annually a crop
from about fifty acres. A worthy
eon of the founder of the town, he
has proved himself consistently
public-spirited, among- the bodies
with which he has rendered good
service to the community being the
Johnstone Shire Council and the
local hospital committee. THOMAS
HENRY FITZ-GERALD was born
on January 3, 1861. On the con-
clusion of his scholastic course in
France he sailed for Brisbane,
where he entered the office of Messrs.
Quinlan, Gray, & Co., with which
firm he continued until arrange-
ments for the conveyance of the first
settlers to the Johnstone River were
completed, when he became one of
the party which embarked on the
“Corea.” He landed at the site of
the present Innisfail on April 23,
1880, being then at the age of nine-
teen, and on the erection of the
“Innisfail” Mill entered upon the
duties of clerk and accountant for
his father. Later, when the family
ceased fo be identified with sugar
culture, he secured the position first
of assistant clerk and then of Shire
clerk, a capacity in which he acted
for the following fourteen years. In
1910 he joined his elder brother in
the sugar industry, and the two car-
ried on as partners for some time.
Mr. T. IT. Fitz-Gerald, who now
owns the farm adjoining his brother’s
property, married in the year 1888
Annie Maude, daughter of the late
M. O’Malley, who was a member of
one of the pioneer country families of
Victoria, representatives of which
have played a prominent part in the
various fields of activity in Queens-
land. There are two sons and two
daughters of the union. The elder
son, Thomas Henry, is a well-known
officer of the English, Scottish, and
Australian Bank, Brisbane, and the
younger, Gregory Maurice (Roy), is
attached to the Brisbane branch of
the Commonwealth Bank. ‘'Red-

northern bank of the Johnstone,
about four miles from Innisfail.
The dwelling, which is a modern
structure, was built in 1921, the
early home having been destroyed by
the cyclone of 1918. It overlooks an
ideal view which embraces both
mountain and river scenery, and, in
the near and middle distances, vast
areas of cane and citrus-bearing
lands.

MR. M. O’DONOHUE.
Bowen, Northern Queensland, is one
of the most representative of the early
pioneers of Queensland. He arrived
in Australia in 1864. When the
Gympie goldfield was in full swing
Mr. O’Donohue was attracted thither
by letters and reports appearing in
the Press, and met with success in the
mine shortly known as the “South
O’Donohue.” With the capital he
accumulated in that mine he invested
in pastoral pursuits, having pur-
chased, fully stocked with sheep and
cattle, “Ferny Side,” a Dawson
River station, which he held for six
years. After hard struggles with
floods and drought he disposed of his
interest in this property and joined
the State Civil Service as Inspector
of Telegraphs. In due course he was
appointed Land Commissioner,
Warden, and Police Magistrate at
Bowen, retaining these offices until
December, 1903. On his departure
from Bowen he received a testimonial
and was accorded a civic banquet, at
which the Mayor presided. With
extreme regret he relinquished the
duties of his triple position in
accordance with the Act providing
for the retirement of Civil servants
at the age limit of sixty-five, and
shortly afterwards established him-
self at Innisfail as an auctioneer and
commission agent. Here he has
built up a profitable business. He is
a Justice of the Peace for Queens-
land, a Justice of the Peace for
South Australia, and a Commissioner
of Affidavits for the State of New
South Wales. At three different
times he was elected a councillor for
the Shire of Johnstone, and at one
time chairman of that council. The
public-spiritedness which has always
distinguished him shows little sign of
abatement, as evidenced by his keen
interest in all that counts for the
betterment of the district. He mar-
ried in the year 1864, Mary, daughter
of the late J. R. Markham, a
member of an Irish family.
Of the union there are three
sons and three daughters, the
former being John Markham
O’Donohue, 8.A., LL.B., Examiner
of Titles, Sydney; James Patrick
O’Donohue, an officer of the South
Johnstone Central Mill; and Charles
O’Donohue, who is engaged in
directing his father’s business. Of
the daughters one is Mrs. A. W.
Mighell, of Gordon Vale; another
Mrs. Callendar, widow of. W. J.
Callendar; and the third, Nellie, a
member of the nursing staff at St.
Vincent’s Hospital, Sydney.
( FRANK EDWIN SHAW, J.P.,
“Brucelee,” Goondi, Innisfail, was
born on December 17, 1870, in the
village of Harley, near Wentworth,
the Yorkshire family seat of Earl
Fitz William. He is the youngest
son of the late Isaac Shaw and
directly descended from ancestry
that ranked among the earliest York-
shire yeomanry, the annals of the
County showing that the family in
unbroken line engaged in agriculture
there for centuries. Though thus
historically identified with primary
production, it contributed also prom-
inent representatives to the manufac-
turing and commercial industries of


the Shire. Isaac Shaw, the grand-
father of Mr. Shaw, of “Brucelee,”
was born at Thorpe Hesley in 1795
and died at Harley in 1861. Isaac
Shaw, his father, first saw the light

at Pontefract in 1830. The line was
founded in Queensland by the late
Frederick Shaw, his uncle, who was
for many years general manager for
the historical firm of Cobb & Co.,
and of whom it is recorded that he
drove the Marquis of Normanby,
Governor of the then Colony over the
Victoria Bridge on the occasion of
the opening ceremony connected
therewith on June 15, 1874, this
being the bridge that was replaced
by the present handsome structure
after the havoc wrought by the flood
of 1893. Frederick Shaw settled
near Beenleigh on a property that
was well known in the locality
as Shaw’s Pocket. Later, his
brother, Mr. Isaac Shaw, with his
wife and ten children, also settled
in the Beenleigh district, having
journeyed from the Old World in the
“Earl Derby” in 1879, the last sail-
ing ship to convey immigrants to
Queensland. Grazing, general farm-
ing and sugar-growing occupied the
latter until the prohibition of
kanaka labour so adversely affected
his sugar interests that he discon-
tinued his landed operations, and,
in the late eighties, proceeded to
Charters Towers where he established
himself in commercial pursuits,
carrying on there until the time of
his death in the year 1905. FRANK
EDWIN SHAW, hie youngest son,
was educated at Cedar Creek. He
terminated his studies when at the
age of fifteen, and for the ensuing
two years, devoted himself to the
family interests in the Beenleigh
district. At seventeen he proceeded
to Cairns, Northern Queensland, to
join the staff of Messrs. Kenion &
Co., whose business was then man-
aged by his brother, Mr. Henry
Thomas Shaw. Soon afterwards
Kenion & Co. sold their Cairns busi-
ness to G. R. Mayers & Co., who
opened the Myola branch at the time
the Cairns-Kurunda railway was in
course of construction, and he was
transferred as manager. He remained
at Myola for some time, and, his
MR. F. W. SHAW
father having meanwhile become es-
tablished in Charters Towers, en-
tered the late' gentleman’s business
there, the various duties of which
occupied him until 1895. From
Charters Towers he proceeded to
Innisfail—in those days written on
the maps as Geraldton—and here
entered upon a venture in partner-
ship with his brother, Arthur, with
the purchase of the stock and trade
of Messrs. G. R. Mayers & Co.
Subsequently he was instrumental in
founding the business of Marwick
and Co. in that town. In 1902, dis-
sociating himself with the last-
named firm, he took over the man-
agement of the establishment of the
firm known as Nolan’s Limited, the
duties of which position occupied him
for the following twelve years,
though towards the latter part of
the period he acquired interests in
the sugar industry. So as to be free
to personally supervise these inter-
ests and others of the same nature
then recently acquired, he relin-
quished his managerial duties in com-
mercial life and entered upon the
personal administration of “Bruce-
lee,” where he has since resided as
one of the prominent sugar pro-
ducers of the district. Some time
after the purchase of this property
he enlarged the sphere of his opera-
tion in the industry, buying “Stock-
ton,” the oldest clearing on the
river and used in the early days as
a fattening paddock for stock in
connection with the butchering
establishment of White & Co.
The first races held in the district
were run here. On “Brucelee” and
“Stockton” are now produced annu-
ally about 5,000 tons of cane. Mr.
Shaw has not failed to support every
aspect of the district’s development.
He was one of the original committee
responsible for the foundation of the
South Johnstone Mill which stands
on what was originally part of his
land ; and from 1907 until the time of
the distinguished gentleman’s death,
represented Sir Robert Philp on the
board of the Mourilyan Mill. For
many years he acted in the interests

of the ratepayers as a member of the
Johnstone Shire Council, and for
three consecutive years was chairman
of that body. Commercially he was
one of the leading men of Innisfail,


in which town, he has for sixteen
years acted on the committee of the
local hospital. A prominent mason,
he has for years taken an active in-
terest in the craft, and has held
therein the highest honours obtainable
locally, and was the first Principal
of the Royal Arch Chapter, Unity
Lodge. His commission as a Justice
of the Peace was received during the
administration of the Philp Govern-
ment. In the year 1897, he married
Elizabeth, daughter of the late
Michael Farrell, who was one of the
oldest representatives of the mining
industry of Charters Towers, where
he was connected with Municipal
affairs in the most flourishing days
of the town. Of the union there is
a family of two sons, Frank Warren
and Edwin Gilbert, and three
daughters, Mary, Hilda and Doro-
thy. The eldest son was born in
Innisfail on June 12, 1899, and
educated at the Brisbane Grammar
School. He is now engaged in the
management of “Stockton” on his
father’s behalf. Edwin Gilbert
Shaw, who is still a student, was
born on April 19, 1909.
The late HEINRICH GOTT-
FRIED SCHEU, as a pioneer of
the pastoral, mining, timber and
sugar industries of Queensland, one
of the earliest arrivals at the Palmer
goldfields, an original settler of the
Cardwell and Innisfail districts, and
the central figure in countless
episodes that called for the utmost
courage, coolness and resource, well
typified all that is finest in the word
“colonist.” He has left a record of
experiences in the memories of his
fellows such as the average man of
to-day has but little or no concep-
tion of. Born and reared in Ger-
many, but opposed to the lack of
individual liberty which even at
that time was sorely felt as the re-
sult of injudicious legislation in his
native country, ere leaving his teens
he sailed for Australia. With no
material assets but the exceptional
physical strength with which he was
endowed, he, in due course, landed
in Queensland, and for some time
employed his energies on various
of the early stations of the then
Colony. When the Palmer goldfield
was opened he was one of the first
to join the rush to the Far Northern
field, where his health suffered as a
result of the malaria which ham-
pered the efforts of the miners so
greatly, and, in his case, more than

narrowly escaping death at the
hands of the latter when attacked
by a tribe of 300. In this encounter
his last cartridge was spent, and to
save their lives, he and his native
boys left tents, tools, food and other
possessions, and faced the rest of
their journey with the peril of star-
vation before them. After opening
up the road which became known as
“Scheu’s track,” he engaged in
storekeeping at Innisfail (then
known as Geraldton, and newly es-
tablished as a township) and from his
headquarters here operated as a pack
carrier over the rough bridle track
to the Jordan Creek goldfield. At
this time he was almost fifty years of
age. Later, he ran a mail contract
by boat between Cardwell and Cook-
town—the then infant and yet
most northerly coastal town of
Queensland —in the course of this
work being a victim of the cyclones
and storms which at certain times
prevail in these localities. Immedi-
ately after the foundation of Gerald-
ton he took up a block of country
under the Homestead Act then in
operation, and even in those early
days devoted the area, in addition to
mixed farming, to sugar production.
To this now well-known sugar pro-
perty he gave the name of “Pioneer
Farm,” and while carrying on here
as an early grower, he engaged not-
ably in the timber industry as one
of its founders in the Tully and
Cardwell districts. As one of the old
cedar getters of these districts he left
a record of efficiency and bushman-
ship unexcelled to this day, and now,
after the passage of nearly half a
century, timber roads and tracks are
recognizable as his handiwork in the
heart of the Northern Queensland
bush in regions where they are the
only indication that this land has
been previously explored. Prom
Innisfail he set up a boarding house
at Cardwell. This business he after-
wards ran as the Royal Hotel, retain-
ing its proprietorship until 1897,
when he disposed of his Cardwell
interests and returned to Innisfail.
Here he started sugar-farming at
“Banna-Rita” on Scheu’s Creek,
where his widow now resides, the
original “Pioneer Farm” having in
the course of time been disposed of
and other lands acquired. After an
absence of forty-seven years he re-
visited his native land, and in 1909,
after some little time spent in the
Old World, he returned to Austra-
lia. At his Innisfail home, in the
same year, occurred the death of this
fine old man, distinguished through-
out his career in his adopted country
for his courage, high principles aud
wonderful industry. It is told of
him as illustrative of his fearlessness
and great strength that, while en-
gaged as a timber getter, he fought
a full-grown crocodile in the attempt
to free one of his men taken while at
work by this particular monster,

Wales. Mr. Collyns returned in the
autumn of life to the Old Country,
where his daughter also resided lor
a time, finally returning to Austra-
lia and proceeding to Cardwell to
take up the duties of a governess, in
which she was engaged at the time
of meeting the late Mr. Scheu. Her
family consists of three sons, Hein-
rich Gottfried, William Collyns and
Arthur James. Of these, the eldest
is engaged in the development of a
seaside resort at Flying Fish Point,
near Innisfail, and the two younger
in sugar production in the district.
The late WILLIAM JACKSON
CALLENDAR, founder of “Kitta-
bah,” Innisfail, was born at Hathe-
rop Rectory, Fairford, Gloucester-
shire, England, in the year 1864,
and received his education at the
famous Marlborough College. He
was the second son of the late Hugh
Callendar, a clergyman of the Estab-
lished Church, a descendant of a line
which extended far back in the his-
tories of Northumberland and Cum-
berland, and whose progenitors,
since the time of the family’s foun-
dation, ranked among the foremost
dwellers of those Counties. To Mr.
W. J. Callendar the unlimited
surveyor and civil engineer he em-
barked for Queensland and arrived
here in the late eighties. His first
move in his adopted country was to
MR. W. J. CALLENDAR
qualify by examination for the right
to practise his profession in the then
Colony, and that done, his arduous
St. John Wood in Maryborough and
the territory lying at the back of
that port, and thence travelled up
the coast to the Far Northern district
watered by the Johnstone River and
which was destined to receive his ser-
vices for the thirty-three years that
remained to him of life. Mr. Cal-
lendar in truth earned for his name
a place in the lists, of the Johnstone
River pioneers, and it may be said
that no man of his time or before
had a more comprehensive knowledge
of the locality which this beautiful
stream waters, the greater portion of
the Innisfail district having been
laid out by him. His work for its
welfare, quite apart from his official
undertakings, was of the most public-
spirited character, and his integrity,
manliness and right views on things
most affecting humanity caused him
to be loved and trusted by all with
whom he was associated. Of excep-
tional physique, he made history in
the sporting life of the famous public
school of which he was a student, and
in the early years of the Johnstone
River district was one of the fore-
most promoters of clean sport in
Geraldton (now Innisfail). He
adapted himself to the conditions of
the vast, lonely, unoccupied spaces
of his adopted country as easily as
“KITTABAH” HOMESTEAD.
opportunities of a young country like
Australia were early apparent, and,
after qualifying in England as a
career as a surveyor in the little-
occupied spaces of the country
began. He spent two years with Mr.
if a bushman born, and quickly be-
came versed in all that pertains to
bush craft; and in the course of


many years (being the only member
of the Survey and Engineering
Department who retained duties in
Northern Queensland for so lengthy
a period) expended his health and
energy in the dense, fever-laden
scrubs in which much of his work
was pursued. 111-health finally over-
took him and, in company with Mrs.
Callendar, a trip to the Philippines
was undertaken in the vain hope that
Nature would restore the vitality of
which she had robbed him. But
the North was destined to see him
a huge crocodile that had rendered
powerless one of his assistants.
“Kittabah” came into his hands
some twenty years ago as a block of
land purchased from the Colonial
Sugar Refining Co. The improve-
ments which now exist on this fine
property were then started and the
land put under sugar, the culture of
which has since been continued.
“Kittabah” has one of the most pic-
turesque and artistic homes in the
North, which is yet occupied by Mr.
Callendar’s widow, who carries on
success as represented by monetary
acquirement, he has nevertheless
contributed to the building up of
Empire and to the great sum of ex-
periences by which younger genera-
tions have been able to profit. Mr.
Callendar married in the year 1895,
Catherine Winifred, daughter of Mr.
M. O’Donohue, who was for a num-
ber of years a resident of Innisfail,
and formerly Police Magistrate,
Land Commissioner and Gold War-
den of Bowen.

no more, for at Manilla on March 6,
1922, came the closing scene of his
useful career. He has left a fine
record of citizenship that is recalled
in association with many public
bodies founded for the progress and
development of the Johnstone River
district, these including the local
ambulance society of which he was
the first chairman of the permanent
committee. It is related of him as
illustrative of his fine physique and
unwavering courage that once, while
working at his profession in the bush,
he attacked singlehanded and killed
the work which he inaugurated so
many years ago, and upholds the hos-
pitable traditions which were estab-
lished during his lifetime. In par-
tial retirement lives here, also, Mr.
Alfred Longbourne, the maternal
uncle of the late owner and an early
pioneer of the State. After engaging
in pastoral pursuits for many years,
Mr. Longbourne followed agricul-
ture on the Darling Downs for a
period. He has spent about half a
century in Queensland, and though
in common with the majority of pio-
neers he was not rewarded with
JOHN HARVEY PAYNE, J.P.,
“Innisfail,” was born at Tingmuth,
Devonshire, England, on January 1,
1867, and is the second son of the
late Thomas and Ann Payne (nee
Harvey). Mr, Thomas Payne, who
was a descendant of a long line of
farming ancestry and engaged in the
calling of his forbears in the Old
World, brought his family to Aus-
tralia exactly half a century ago,
landing in Brisbane from the “Con-
roy.” Settling at Toowong—then
mostly bush land and sparsely popu-
lated—he applied his knowledge of


agriculture to “Lang Farm,” a
property which he acquired in the
now-fashionable suburb, engaging
for two years in mixed farming
here. At the end of that period
he took up a large holding of dense

scrub land at Oxley, and began to
clear and develop it for farming.
In time he had the country well
under cultivation, but his enterprise
and hard work were hampered by
many adversities, chief among which
were frequently recurring floods (as
many as nine having inundated the
farm in eighteen years) that again
and again ruined his crops and at
times necessitated the removal of the
whole family in boats sent to their
rescue. The gentleman under review
can recall an occasion when the flood
waters reached the ceiling of the old
farm homestead of the Paynes,
which was of historical interest in-
somuch that the late statesman, Sir
Samuel Griffith, held his first poli-
tical meeting here and discussed
policies which later became laws that
continue in force at the present day.
ThelateThomas Payne was one of the
most popular of the public speakers
of his time; and without hope or ex-
pectation of emolument of any kind
put forth his best efforts for the
advancement of the then Colony. He
was a strong supporter of religious
movements and public charities,
and his industrial activities helped
the trend of primary production
in Queensland. In all aspects of
his life’s work he was assisted by
his wife, whose influence with him
was of the nature ever exercised by
those we like to look upon as personi-
fying the noblest conception of Aus-
tralian womanhood. Mrs. Payne
laid the foundation stone of the first
Methodist Church in Oxley at a date
harking sixty years back, and was
presented on the occasion with a
silver trowel. To Mr. and Mrs.
Payne, who are both buried in the
Church of England Cemetery at
Sherwood, were born three sons and
four daughters, and of this family
six are yet residents of the State, its
representative in Innisfail being its
only unmarried member. That gen-
tleman, Mr. John Harvey Payne,
is a nephew of Mr. William Harvey
Payne, J.P., a very well-known
citizen of Brisbane and its district
in the early days and a prominent
supporter of the Methodist Church
and the temperance cause. This
gentleman was Superintendent of
the Methodist Sabbath School, with
which he had a very long associa-
tion. He was chairman and one of
the original members of the Cabool-
ture Divisional Board and one of the
most active workers for railway com-
munication. Mr. John Harvey
Payne was educated in Brisbane at
an academy conducted during the
seventies and eighties by Mr. A. J.
Boyd, whose efforts in their behalf
are held in kindly memory by many
of the sons of the men who helped
in the making of the now thriving
and important city. When at the
age of fourteen he discarded his
books for the practical work of his
father’s farm, and a year later was
given a portion of the home acreage
to work on his own account. To this
block he applied the latest known
suggestions in respect to* production,
and was the recipient of a medal
awarded by the National Associa-
tion for the best methods of cultiva-
tion, and competed for by eighty
other applicants. He was engaged
in farming at Oxley until reaching
the age of seventeen, when one of
the disastrous floods to which the
land was subject, was the determin-
ing factor that caused him to seek
other fields for his energies. Choos-
ing Northern Queensland for its
agricultural potentialities, and
anxious to gain an insight into the
manufacturing side of the sugar
industry, he obtained a position as
one of the staff of the “Farley” Mill,
continuing to be thus employed until
an opportunity was afforded him of
becoming fully conversant with the
actual culture of the product as
manager of “Bri-Bri” Plantation on
the Mossman River. This property
was among those small but hitherto
flourishing estates which failed to
survive the adverse conditions imme-
diately following the coming into
force of the anti-kanaka legislation,
which affected his career to the ex-
tent that he left the Mossman to
seek another position. His objec-
tive was gained in the Johnstone
River district, where he was
appointed manager of the Queens-
land Sugar Company’s Mill —a capa-
city in which he acted for the next
two years. As manager of this mill
he became acquainted with the late
A. W. D. White, who induced him
to take over the control of “Stock-
ton,” a grazing property near Innis-
fail (then Geraldton) which was used
for slaughtering purposes and as a
depot for “Bluff Downs” Station
stock overlanded from the Charters
Towers district. He conducted this
business for Mr. White for eighteen
MR. J. H. PAYNE.
years, having in that interval pur-
chased a sugar farm at South John-
stone and been instrumental in gain-
ing for the locality a central mill. In
the latter connection he worked inde-
fatigably—preparing plans, getting


out the statistics warranting the
mill’s erection, interviewing State
and Federal Ministers, and canvass-
ing the position from every point of
view. He was with other prominent
planters a founder of the South John-
stone Cane Growers’ Association, a
body which has had far-reaching
effects in the industry and has
largely stimulated its development
locally. After improving his farm
he disposed of it and seized the
opportunity offered by the sale of the
old butchering business known as
White & Co. to return to the calling
to which he had devoted so many
years. Making this business the
basis of a company concern in which
he secured the co-operation of a
number of representative farmers of
the district he was asked to repre-
sent the ratepayers in the Shire
Council, of which he has been a
member for over thirty years, and
chairman for several terms. For a
number of years he has been presi-
dent of the hospital committee, and
as a committeeman of the Agricul-
tural Society he has encouraged in-
dustry by strong personal support.
Mr. Payne’s generosity in the causes
of charity, patriotism or other good
objectives is proverbial, and he is
well known to the community as a
good, clean sport. He was president
of the local race club for many years
and owned and raced several fine
horses. Masonic affairs claim much
of his interest as an officer of the
Mourilyan Lodge of the craft.
outset of his career in Australia,
being for many years directed
towards the development of its
mineral resources. His initial ex-
perience was gained in a very hard
school, for he was on© of the earliest
prospectors on the site of Ravens-
wood; in fact, in company with
others, he found this field, with
which he was identified until the
discovery of gold on the site of
Charters Towers in the year 1872,
which saw him among the ten who
were in the van of the rush to what
was soon after to become a large and
flourishing town. With the for-
tunes of Charters Towers his own
rose, and in time his name became
well known as one of Australia’s
prominent mining men. As a

the district, he formed and desig-
nated the Johnstone River Co-opera-
tive Butchering Co., of which he was
immediately appointed managing
director. Although his time has
since been largely occupied by the
duties of this important position, he
has continued to identify himself
with the staple industry of the John-
stone River watershed, and given
much of his leisure to affairs of
public moment. He owns “River-
stone,” a cane property on the main
tramline of South Johnstone, a
township of which he may well be
called the father and wherein he holds
considerable real estate. The bodies
with which he has been most notably
associated in a public capacity are
the Johnstone River Shire Council,
the Johnstone River Agricultural
Society and the local hospital com-
mittee. Shortly after his advent to
GEORGE HARRIS DONALD
PLANT, “Gosford,” Halifax,
Northern Queensland, was born at
Charters Towers on April 1, 1890,
and is the only surviving son of the
Hon. Edmund Harris Thornburgh
Plant, whose name should be per-
petuated in the mining history of
the State for the part he played in
connection with the development and
progress of Charters Towers. Not
only this city, but Northern Queens-
land as a whole, has benefited by
the energy, enterprise, and excep-
tional ability which, in his active
days, distinguished this pioneer,
who started life in his adopted
country in the early sixties as a
young man in his teens. Of English
birth, he is typical of the fine
colonizing class who have been the
Empire’s best builders in every part
of the world, his efforts, from the
director of many of the piincipal
companies promoted to allow _of
larger enterprise, and by investing
the bulk of his capital in developing
the resources of the field, he con-
tributed largely towards the expan-
sion of the present city, to
interests he further devoted himselt
as a member of the various pro-
gressive bodies, including the
Dalrymple Divisional Board the
Townsville Harbour Board, and the
Charters Towers Water Board, being
a founder of the last-named mstitu-
tion. His acquirements and ability
were recognized in a public way more
than twenty years ago, when he was
called to the legislative Council by
the Liberal Government then in
power Among many fine character-
istics, his large conception of charity
will probably be best remembered by
old-time friends who had the


privilege of knowing him when for-
tune smiled on his undertakings. Now
in the autumn time of life he lives
in retirement at “Goose Lagoon,” a
property near Ingham, where he

interests himself in pastoral pursuits,
which, on a considerably larger scale,
claimed much of his attention in
earlier years, and throughout the
period of depression caused by the
tick pest and the drought which
devastated the country during
1901-3. “Thornburgh House,” the
beautiful home which he occupied
in Charters Towers, is now used as
Webb, of the Toowoomba branch of
the London Bank of Australia;
another to Mr. A. L. Musgrave, who
is engaged in sugar-growing in the
Herbert district, while the two
younger are, respectively, the wives
of Mr. Burkett, of the Queensland
National Bank, and Mr. Gibson, a
Southern Queensland pastoralist.
The only unmarried daughter served
as an army sister with the A.I.F.
during the Great War, ministering
to the sick and wounded on trans-
port duty, and on the Egyptian and
Continental fronts. She now resides
with her father at “Goose Lagoon.”
Mr. George Harris Donald Plant
also saw service abroad. He was
educated at the Melbourne Grammar
School, and on leaving there entered
upon a course of training at the
Charters Towers School of Mines.
Mining pursuits occupied him at
Charters Towers and Mount Morgan,
successively, until the outbreak of
the War, when he volunteered and
was accepted for service with the
A.I.F. He gained his commission
and in the course of the struggle
participated in the fighting in
Northern France and on the Belgian
front, being so severely wounded at
Paschendaele on September 20, 1917,
as to preclude further activity in the
trenches. On regaining his strength
he was accordingly sent to Australia,
where he was allotted military ser-
vice which occupied him until his
demobilization after the Armistice.
He then invested in the property
near Halifax which is known as
“Gosford” Farm. “Gosford” is one
large two-storied structure, and its
surroundings, are among the most
desirable in the district, the former
being artistically appointed and the

flourish many rare plants. In the
year 1915 Mr. Plant married Maude
Matilda, daughter of Mr. William

descendant of old English stock, who
has been identified with the pastoral
industry throughout the whole of his
active career, being engaged at time

WILCOX. A notable pioneer, the
gentleman whose career forms the

subject matter of this review, was one
of those sturdy, self-reliant and up-
right scions of an English race who
wrested success from most harsh and
unpromising conditions by sheer hard
work, indomitable pluck and perse-
verance. Bom at Bridgwater,
Somersetshire, England, he was a
descendant of yeoman stock, his pro-
genitors of many successive genera-
tions having engaged in agricultural
pursuits in this County, and given
ample proof of that love, loyalty and
industry which constitute England’s
power at home and the ties binding
her dependencies abroad. He was
the last male of his line in the
Motherland, and ere reaching man’s
estate decided to strike out for him-
self in the far-away Continent of
Australia, choosing Queensland in
which to settle. In this country of
unbounded resources he made an in-
dependent start in the early days as
a carrier, travelling west from
Townsville with horse teams and
supplying the widely separated hold-
ings along the routes with the neces-
saries of existence. In those days
the roads were little better than
rough tracks, in places scarcely dis-
cernible, and the calling chosen by
Mr. Wilcox was of the most arduous
nature. Disastrous flood conditions,
ww
devastating droughts, appalling
storms and intense heat were among
the hardships with which he had to
contend, and these in their train
brought frequently, deterioration of
large quantities of food stuffs, suffer-
ings from lack of water over long
dry spells, and other trials. Before
he had been long on the roads his
reliability and honesty of disposition
caused him to be highly thought of
by the dwellers “outback,’’ and there
was probably no better-known figure
travelling those long lonely stretches
between widely-separated centres.
Old-timers will recall in association
with his name, his great love of
horses, for his team was the pride
of the roads. After he had gained
considerable experience, as a carrier,
he married and went to the John-
ston© River district, where he secured
employment on the “Goondi” plan-
tation as one of the staff of the Col-
onial Sugar Refining Company.
Here, he equipped himself with
knowledge likely to be of service in
an independent venture, and at the
end of a few years, when satisfied
as to his experience and the possi-
bilities of sugar-growing in a smaller
way than usual at the period, he
started production on his own
account, being one of the few white
men who in those early days essayed
the cultivation of sugar without the
aid of kanaka labour, proving, when
the cry was strongest to the con-
trary, that coloured labour was not
essential to the success of the indus-
try, and thus, by his practical en-
couragement of the policy which
afterwards became recognized as the
main plank of any party that would
command success in Commonwealth
politics, may be called a pioneer of
“White Australia.’’ The farm
which he then took up is “Blink
Bonnie,” and here, by that combina-
tion of intelligence and untiring in-
dustry which had carried him thus
far, he surmounted every adverse
condition, his broad grasp of the in-
dustrial situation, his progressive
methods as a cane grower, and many
evidences of public-spiritedness,
earning for him an important place
in the life of the district. For many
years he carried on with compara-
tive success, and, eventually, in
1914, enlarged his property by the
purchase of an adjoining farm.
Three years later he was recorded as
the supplier of the largest quota of
cane to the Goondi Mill, and the
reputation he then acquired for
“Blink Bonnie’’ holds good to-day,
for the property produces annually
some 5,000 tons of cane, a yield un-
excelled probably in the State as the
output of a single farm. Of the 400
acres comprising the area, about 240
are under cultivation. Mr. Wilcox
played an important part in connec-
tion with the development of the
Innisfail district, having for some
years rendered excellent service as a
member of the Johnstone Shire
Council. He was one of the
founders of the Johnstone River
Cane Growers’ Association, a body
which greatly advanced the inter-
ests of the planters of this locality,
and in which his exhaustive know-
ledge of the industry proved invalu-
able. As a delegate of the Southern
conferences the services rendered by
him are regarded as of the highest
importance. The keenness which he
brought to all his undertakings was
apparent in his support of outdoor
sport, in which connection his en-
thusiasm was the main factor to-
wards success in many a sporting
movement. He was a foundation
member of the Mourilyan branch of
the Masonic Order, and a Past
Master and a Deputy Grand Officer
of this lodge. Among other bodies
with which he was associated are the
Royal Society of St. George and the

Oddfellows’ Lodge, of which he
was for many years an active
member. Mr. Wilcox married in
the middle eighties, Barbara Forbes,
who was of old Scottish descent, two
sons and a daughter being the issue
of the union. His death, which


occurred in the year 1921, deprived

esteemed pioneers. COLIN EARLE

SEYMOUR HERBERT WAR-
NER, J.P., Cai ms, is Queens-
land born and bred, having first
seen the light in Maryborough, on
February 7, 1874. He is a son of the
MR. S. H. WARNER.
late John Reid Warner, who, a des-
cendant of old English stock and a
past student of the historic academy
known as Winchester School, came to
Queensland when it was in its
infancy as a Colony, and continued
throughout a career of over thirty
years to be prominently connected
with the Civil Service as Land Com-
missioner. The name is associated by
many with the early settlement of
Western Australia, where his uncle,
Mr. Frederick Warner, was one of
the pioneer surveyors. Through the
marriage of his "father, Mr. J. R.
Warner, to Lucelle Jeanette Symes,
the gentleman under review is des :
cended from a family well known in
connection with the early settlement
of South Australia and subsequently
of Queensland, where a branch was
established some sixty years ago.
Educated primarily in Queensland
State schools, he completed his col-
legiate career under the headmaster-
ship of the late Rev. Clifford Power
at Christ Church School, Toowoomba.
His first position was that of assistant
Clerk of the Rosalie Divisional
Board, which he relinquished to join
the staff of the Toowoomba branch of
the Queensland National Bank, Ltd.
After holding this post for three
years he resigned it to accept a better
appointment in the Toowoomba office
of the Union Bank of Australia,
ww2
Ltd., with which he was associated
for live years as manager’s clerk and
officer in charge of the securities
department. He eventually resigned
from the Union Bank, also, so as to
be free to take a responsible post in
Northern Queensland with the firm
of Hobson & Co., Wine and Spirit
merchants of Cairns. Then in his
middle twenties, he had only been
engaged in Cairns for a year, when,
owing to the death of his employer,
he was requested to continue the
management of the business until
such time as he could effect a satis-
factory sale. In due course this was
arranged, the purchasers being the
firm of John Cairns, Ltd. Shortly
after the conclusion of the transac-
tion, he was offered the position of
accountant with the joint firm of W.
MR. J. R. WARNER
J. Munro & Co. and Munro, Gordon
& Co., with which he was associated
for many years, gaining by his keen-
ness, thoroughness and ability, the
full confidence of the principal, the
late W. J. Munro. On the death of
that gentleman he was appointed one
of the executors, and on the division
of the estate among beneficiaries, was
requested by them to carry on as the
administrator of their large interests
in Queensland. This he has since con-
tinued to do, from his headquarters
in Cairns, supervising, also, his own
interests in the sugar industry, which,
embracing several farms in the out-
lying district, are on a scale
sufficiently large to claim for him and
his family the reputation of being
one of the “largest” private growers
hereabouts. Since the year 1912 Mr.
Warner has been a Director of the
Mulgrave Central Sugar Mill. He
v/as created a Justice of the
Peace under the Philp Administra-
tion. Innumerable instances exem-
plify the public-spirited character of
his career as a citizen of the Herbert
district, among the bodies which
claim much of his time and attention
being the Cairns Shire Council, of
which he became a member a decade
ago, and has been chairman for the
past three years. The town of Bab-
inda owes much of its development
and general progress to his efforts,
which have been largely responsible
also for the foundation of the Bab-
inda Sugar Mill. He has for many
years been a member of the Cairns
Chamber of Commerce, and several
times its president, and was
prominently connected with the
Patriotic Fund of Cairns. All
charitable movements have in him a
ready supporter, and he is a most
valued member of the congregation
of the local Church of England.
In the year 1899, he married Sarah
Ellen, daughter of the late Joseph
Wonderley, who, a well-known phar-
macist of Toowoomba, and an early
Queensland chemist, was the founder
of one of the oldest families of that
town. The union produced two sons
and two daughters. The sons, John

Moneymore National School, he is
a son of the late David Irvin, a
Londonderry farmer, who, also of
Irish birth, was a descendant of an
old Scottish line and a son of one
Robert Irvin, the founder of a
branch of the family in Ireland at
a period which witnessed the estab-
lishment of one of the Scotch colonies
across the water. Mr. W. Irvin’s
career in Queensland bespeaks him a
typical representative of the colon-
izing stock from which he springs,
for no task proved too difficult, no
conditions too trying that offered
stepping stones to the success which
it was his aim to ultimately com-
mand. His first position, shortly
after landing, was in the sugar in-
dustry as an employe at the Yen-
garie Mill, near Maryborough, where
he became au fait with the possi-
bilities of cane-growing, and whence,
with the object of seeing more of the
country and obtaining experience of
the industry under different climatic
conditions, he proceeded north and
secured work on a plantation in the
vicinity of Mackay. Desiring to
familiarize himself with other phases
of production in Queensland, he
subsequently transferred his energies
to a sawmill occupying a site in
the vicinity of Charters Towers, and
secured very valuable knowledge in
the course of the two years he re-
mained here. On relinquishing this
post he made his way south and
sought and obtained in a timber mill
near Brisbane employment that occu-
pied him until the desire of further
travel and fresh experience prompted
him to visit the tableland country
west of Cairns, where at Mount
Albion (now a deserted township)
he took a position in a smelting
works. This was in 1888, and sub-
sequently, having equipped himself
in a very strenuous school with a
fair knowledge of three important
branches of industry as carried on
in his adopted country, he decided
MR. W. J. IRVIN.
to devote his further efforts to sugar-
growing. For additional experience,
as a preliminary to investment, he
obtained a post on a Herbert River
farm, where he continued to work
until the opportunity offered of
launching out on his own account
with the purchase of the fine agri-
cultural block upon which his home
now stands. To this block, which
came into his possession in 1898, he
gave the name of “Lily Yale,” and
the improvements which he immedi-
ately inaugurated were carried out
to such purpose that he was ere long
in a position to add to his holdings,
his up-to-date policy of procedure
resulting in continued success, so
that now the area of “Lily Vale” is
made up of four farms aggregating
an acreage well in excess of 1,000,
from which is produced an annual
yield of 4,500 tons of cane. His
interests extend to the grazing in-
dustry, and his landed possessions
include a cattle property near
Yungaburra as well as considerable
real estate in the town of Cairns.
The value of his citizenship as a suc-
cessful grower was in the past
augmented by the application of his
experience and ability to the inter-
ests of the Mulgrave Mill at Gor-
donvale, of which he is a director,
and is still further proved by his
efforts in connection with any move-
ment—charitable, religious, or
patriotic—whereby the community
may benefit, the more general
aspect of his public-spi ri tedn ess find-
ing a capable coadjutor in Mrs.
Irvin, a lady distinguished for her
energy in forwarding many move-
ments tending to the welfare of
humanity. On his father’s property
in the Old Land Mr. Irvin acquired
both the knowledge and love of
horses, characteristics which have
remained with him throughout his
life and been evidenced for many
years past by the type of mounts he
has continually in training for turf-
ing events. He is a stanch supporter

of all forms of clean sport, more
particularly of racing, and as the
owner of entrants for events on
the courses of Northern Queensland
has frequently seen his colours—


black and gold—borne to victory. In
the year 1899 lie married Margaret,
daughter of the late James Seely,
a member of a North of Ireland
family which for long in the history
of that part of the island had been
identified with primary production
and the flax-milling industry. Four
sons and two daughters are the issue
of this union, the sons, named in
order of their age, being Wilson
James, Frederick John, Robert and
Wilfred Henry, and the daughters,
Lily and Marjorie Isobel. The “Lily
Yale’’ homestead was erected about
ten years ago, and is one of the pret-
tiest and most up-to-date homes in
the district. Nestling in the shadow
of the Pyramid and Bartle Frere
Mountains, two elevations of the
coastal range through which, over a
distance of t\vo miles, runs a road
from the farm to the sea, the home-
stead is two-storied, commodious,
and most artistically appointed. Its
grounds are laid out into walks,
lawns, flower beds, and a tennis
court, and they bear many fine
species of tropical and sub-tropical
trees and plants. The hospitality
which is to be met with at “Lily
Vale,” and which its host and hostess
so courteously dispense, is of the
quality which has gained for the
bush homes of Australia a name of
which bush folk are rightly proud.

his native land. When Mr. William
Greenwood was at the age of twenty
he concurred with his father in the
opinion that better prospects for the
family might be hoped for in Aus-
tralia than in England, so prepara-
tions were made for a voyage which,
being undertaken in due course,
terminated at Townsville in the year

for some months. The year follow-
ing their arrival, however, he joined
his parents and other members of the
family in Cairns, and in conjunction
with the late gentleman and his
younger brother became engaged in
brickmaking for the late Louis
Severn. John Greenwood and his
sons may be described as among the
pioneers of the brickmaking industry
in Cairns, for at the time they first
started operations not more than
20,000 bricks had been manufactured
here. They continued in the trade
in Cairns for about two years, the
brothers, Messrs. William and John
Greenwood, jun., towards the end of
that period purchasing horses and a
packing outfit, and starting as car-
riers between Cairns and Herberton.
bor seven years these young men
continued to thus supply the settlers
on the Cairns-Herberton route, their
occupation proving a very strenuous
one and calling for considerable


foresight, resource, and endurance,
and demanding of them continual
sacrifice, in order that the dwellers
“out back” from Cairns might be
provided with the necessaries of life.
By the termination of the above-
named period they were in a position
to make a start on the land, renting,
in conjunction with their father, a
block in the vicinity of Gordonvale.
From this block they were shortly
able to supply a fair tonnage of cane
to the Mulgrave Sugar Mill, then
recently erected. Their develop-
mental operations gradually resulted
in greater production as they con-
tinued to supply their quota to the
mill for which they were among the
pioneer growers, and ere long the
Messrs. Greenwood, father and
sons, became the owners instead
of the tenants of “Ramsay” Farm,
which they purchased in the year
1901. On the decease of their father,
Messrs. William and John Green-
wood carried on as partners, their
association—dating from the time of
their acquirement of the property—
as joint landholders, being spread
over a period of about eighteen
years and continuing until 1915,
when the elder purchased the
younger’s interests and became the
sole owner of “Ramsay.” The farm
still claims much of the time and
attention of Mr. Greenwood, sen.,
and his efforts are vigorously
seconded by his sons, the joint exer-
tions of the family resulting in the
production of 1,000 tons annually
from the area. Mr. Greenwood is
temperamentally averse to publicity
in any shape or form, and takes no
part in local government. The value
of his citizenship to the district is,
none the less, indisputable, his past
and present industry, which has
acquired for him his status as one of
the principal residents of the town
and district of Cairns, being of the
character which is the first essential
for communal prosperity and without
which the progress of a district is
impossible. He is a member of the
local Masonic Lodge and has borne
honours as an office bearer of the
craft. His marriage occurred in the
year 1904 to Annie, daughter of the
late James Seeley, and he has a
family of eight sons and one
daughter. The branch of the Seeley
family of which Mrs. Greenwood is
a member was well known in connec-
tion with the flax-milling industry-
in the North of Ireland, several of
her progenitors having also engaged
in agriculture there.
“RAMSAY” FARM HOMESTEAD.


JOHN GORDON, J.P., Gordon -
vale, Cairns, is a native of County
Antrim, Ireland, and is a scion of a
family of purely Irish origin, suc-
cessive generations of which were
identified with agricultural pursuits
in the northern portion of the coun-
try as typical of the older population
and their descendants, in contra-
distinction to the majority of the
Irish of Scottish ancestry who in
the North have played such an
important part in trade and manu-
facture. He was born on May 12,
1852, and educated at the National
School, Broughshane, Antrim. On
reaching the age of fifteen he con-
cluded his studies and began life on
his father’s farm, where it was
expected he would remain and carry
on in the calling of his forbears.
However, the fact that his elder
brother, William, had struck out
for himself in a newer country, had
its effect on John, who, after the
manner of youth, became impatient
to try his fortune in a land offering
possibilities far and away beyond
attainment at home. William Gor-
don had sailed for Victoria from
home in 1857 and for New Zealand
about 1867, and it was in 1870 that
John followed him in the ship
“Excelsior,” arriving in Auckland
towards the end of that year. The
brothers were associated in mining
the mining population of Maori
Land and resulted in the embarka-
tion of many of the sturdy pioneers
of the industry there for the distant
field away in the north-east of the
MR. J. GORDON.
Island Continent. The subject of our
memoir was among these, and, hav-
ing studied every phase of the indus-
try during the three years spent in
1874, and, joining forces with two
mates, secured horses and started on
the overland journey to the Palmer.
Here the trio remained and did
fairly well for three years at the end
of which Mr. John Gordon turned
his attention to Port Douglas, then
newly come into existence. To Port
Douglas he travelled the first mob of
bullocks to enter the township, and
with these started butchering opera-
tions for the benefit of the settlers
hereabouts, importing cattle from
the hinterland as they were required
and doing excellent business for
some considerable time. Finally, he
sold out, and, in partnership with his
cousin, Mr. Robert Gordon, started
a similar venture at Goldsborough,
then the centre of a new mining field
but destined to be short-lived as a
township. Owing to the rapid de-
cline of the industry here, the
Messrs. Gordon experienced a rather
severe setback; and John, having
invested heavily in mining shows in
the locality, suffered, also, a con-
siderable loss of private capital.
These partners, though cousins of the
same name and descended from two
old County Antrim families, are
sons of Gordons of unrelated stock,
their mothers being members of one
family. On the winding up of the
Goldsborough business in the early
eighties, Mr. John Gordon removed
pursuits until 1873, when the news
of the discovery of the Palmer River
goldfield, Northern Queensland, be-
came the topic of discussion among
MR. GORDON’S HOME AT GORDONVALE.
the Dominion, was well equipped for
prospecting on the new field. He
landed in Cooktown, on the coast of
the Far North, in January of the year
to Pyramid, a township six miles
from Gordonvale, where he opened a
butcher s shop in 1882. He carried
on a very successful business at


Pyramid during the ten years which
witnessed the prosperity of that now
abandoned sugar plantation, and in
1892 established himself in the town
with whose progress he was destined
to be so prominently identified.
Gordonvale, which was then known
as Nelson, received its present desig-
nation in compliment to him when
the Government desired that the
centre should be re-named so as to
prevent it being wrongly identified
with the well-known New Zealand
town. The local Progress Associa-
tion wishing, on behalf of the towns-
people, to perpetuate the apprecia-
tion in which his pioneering work is
held, on suggesting the name of
Gordonvale, particularly expressed
the desire that this title should be
gazetted. Mr. Gordon was for long
a member of the well-known firm of
Munro and Gordon, in which he was
associated with Messrs. Alexander
and William J. Munro and his
cousin, Mr. Robert Gordon, in the
administration of what was regarded
as the leading concern of its kind for
more than a quarter of a century.
This firm operated as general
butchers and station owners, and
when the partnership was dissolved
after the death of Mr. W. J. Munro,
he actively carried on in the same
lines on his own account, having for
many years previously had butcher-
ing and farming interests apart
from those in which he was associated
with his partners. In the year 1906
he discontinued butchering, and at
the present time devotes his still
vigorous faculties to the administra-
tion of sugar-farming and grazing
interests acquired at different times.
A founder and a director since the
time of its inception, twenty-six
years ago, and the only surviving
member of the original directorate
of the Gordonvale Co-operative Mill,
Mr. Gordon has been for over a
quarter of a century continually
interested in the sugar industry. He
may be described as the “father” of
the Mulgrave district, for his pion-
eering here dates back to the middle
nineties, since when he has assisted
practically every movement insti-
tuted for the development of the
district or other worthy cause, his
activities of a charitable or patriotic
nature having been worthily seconded
by Mrs. Gordon. He still interests
himself in various communal affairs,
being a committeeman of the School
of Arts and other bodies, and, as a
Justice of the Peace, yet exercises the
functions of his office, which he re-
ceived at the hands of the Byrnes
Administration. In the year 1901
he married Elizabeth Mary, daughter
of John O’Byrne, who, a descendant
of Celtic stock and hailing from
Dublin, Ireland, became one of the
early residents of Central Queens-
land, where, in various centres, he
followed the calling of a blacksmith,
and by industry in the face of
many adversities, neighbourliness to
his fellows and the rearing of a
large family, contributed his share
to the making of the nation. Mr.
John Gordon’s sugar property is
situated at Mt. Sophia, on the
Babinda railway line, and here his
enterprise results in the annual yield
of 2,000 tons of cane. At his charm-
ing home in Gordonvale he now lives
in retirement, rich in the possession
of memories of conditions of which
we are fast losing sight, and which
make the past to him as the pages of
an interesting book. To his guests
is accorded that fine hospitality
which he and his good wife hold as
a heritage from their Celtic forbears.
EDWARD CAMPBELL EARL,
“Balaclava,” Cairns. Of the pioneer
families of Northern Queensland,
few have been established under
more adventurous conditions or in
the face of greater hardships than
that of which the subject of this
memoir is now the head. Its founda-
tion in Australia dates from the
early sixties, when three brothers.
JAMES, THOMAS and WILLIAM
EARL, fresh from Ely, Cambridge-
shire, England, landed at the newly
chartered port of Bowen. These
brothers migrated westward and
eventually took up a vast area of
country that they stocked and
formed into a cattle station, designa-
ting it “Glen Lee,” a title which
afterwards gave place to “Yaca-
munda,” now of historical signifi-
cance in the story of the pastoral
development of the immense terri-
tory comprised in “the North.”
This property produced splendid
stock, and at one period of its his-
tory it could muster 25,000 head of
shorthorns and about 200 horses of
a particularly good class bearing the
much sought after EL7 brand of the
Earls. About the year 1864, Messrs.
James and Thomas Earl trekked still
further west in search of good pas-
toral country, taking the nucleus of
a herd with which to form a run
when suitable land was found. The
elder, J ames, had then recently mar-
ried a newly-arrived Irish girl named
Marion Campbell, who accompanied
her husband on the rough overland
journey which ended in the far-
distant Flinders watershed. It is
unnecessary to dilate upon the in-
numerable hardships that such a
journey involved and the privations
and discomforts which accompanied
the early development of the hold-
ing, named by the brothers, “Iffley”
after a town in their beloved Cam-
bridgeshire, and shortly established
as a well-equipped outstation of
“Glen Lee” (“Yacamunda”). At
“Iffley” was born to Mr. James Earl
his first child, who afterwards be-
came the wife of Mr. C. E. Jodrell,
recently a planter of the Innisfail
district. Fortune was against the
brothers’ enterprise as pioneers of
the Flinders country, for in the year
1865, incessant rains overflowed the
river’s banks until its waters sub-
merged and washed away the im-
provements which they had been at
such pains to establish; claimed as
victims their stock whose carcases
were afterwards to be seen entangled
in the highest boughs of trees or
piled where the rushing waters left
them; and would have ended the
lives of the indomitable young
Englishmen who had braved Nature
to establish a settlement in the
Never-Never, had they not been fine
athletes and as fit as their outdoor
life could make them. Both six
feet in stature, the elder assisting his
wife from tree to tree and the
younger carrying the infant girl,
they swam for miles to a place of
safety. Thankful to have thus es-
caped a fate which befell many who
were in the van of settlement, they
returned to the original home,
where, with the third brother, they
set themselves to recoup their losses.
Progress was slow, however, as the
disastrous flood was followed by the
bank crisis of 1866, which created
intense depression throughout the
country, though the wonderful
powers of the soil of Northern
Queensland soon helped the brothers
on the way to renewed prosperity.
Things continued to improve until
the discovery of the rich goldfield of
Charters Towers in 1872, and
Ravenswood and others in quick suc-
cession, gave a wonderful impetus to
settlement and development in the
North, the whole of which was elec-
trified towards the end of 1873 by
the stories of the wonderful wealth


of alluvial gold to be found on the
Palmer. So rich was this field that
it is said that gold was on one occa-
sion used for horse shoes, the
scarcity of iron shoes making those
of the rarer metal of the lesser
value; and that for a fifty pound
MR. J. EARL.
weight bag of flour was exchanged
gold worth fifty sovereigns. The
stories of the gold on the Palmer
determined James Earl to set out
and test the possibilities of the field,
and in pursuance of this object he
arranged with his brothers to take in
drafts his share of the stock held in
partnership, with the idea of forming
a run in the Far North. He left
“Yacamunda” in the year 1874
droving about 500 head of cattle and
a number of horses, his goods and
chattels being conveyed at the same
time by two bullock teams. After
months of travel the caravan arrived
at the Palmer waters and its leader
made a camp from which to explore
the country for a suitable run for
his “Yacamunda” stock. He pros-
pected territory to the west, north
and, finally, the east, before his
journeyings brought him to the top
of a range of hills that he later
learned was the divide of the Gulf
and the eastern watershed. The
prospect which then opened up be-
fore him is best described in his own
words. He wrote, “I saw, some 500
to 1,000 ft. below me, miles of roll-
ing plains and tablelands of beauti-
ful green grassed lands, and many
running streams; and I immediately
decided to' squat there with all I
possessed; and I established the
station I now have which I loved to
call ‘Butcher Hill,’ after an endeared
spot near my native town.” To
“Butcher Hill” James Earl soon
brought the remainder of his stock,
and while they were en route es-
tablished a carrying business, placing
four bullock teams on the roads for
the cartage of food supplies from
Cooktown to Maytown, the chief
centre of the Palmer District. At
the prevailing rates of =£loo to £2OO
per ton, and with a team able to draw
up to eight tons, this proved a very
profitable undertaking. “Butcher
Hill” has many historical associa-
tions. Within its boundaries is
situated the locality known as Hell’s
Gates, notorious as the point from
which many a swagman and Chinese
settler fell into the hands of the
ferocious cannibalistic tribes in-
habiting the region. A block of
country is named Macquarie after
two brothers, packers, who while
hunting for their horses were sur-
prised and captured here, and met
with a most tragic fate, for the
blacks, having no immediate need of
food, amputated their legs to the
knees to prevent them from getting
away, and thus kept them until they
were finally killed. It was many
years before “Butcher Hill” was
safe as a residence for white folks,
but that fact did not deter Mrs.
Earl with her three-year-old son
(Mr. E. C. Earl of Cairns) and
three daughters, then comprising her
family, from joining her husband in
1877. At “Butcher Hill,” she, like
the late gentleman, set her children
an example of endurance and cour-
age that had its effect in making
them worthy of their parentage and
strong and useful citizens of the
State. To Mr. James Earl and his
wife were born four sons and three
daughters. Of the sons, Mr,
Edward Campbell Earl is the eldest.
He was born in Bowen on January
14, 1874, and such schooling as he
received until attaining the age of
twelve was at the hands of a gov-
erness. He was then sent to Cook-
town where for six months he
attended the town school. Returning
to “Butcher Hill,” he resumed his
desultory studies under the station
governess, but his love of stock and
his usefulness among them proved
detrimental factors in respect to his
education at home, and he was there-
fore sent to St. Joseph’s College,
Hunter’s Hill. Here he remained
for two years, and after a vacation
at home, proceeded to Townsville
Grammar School, where he studied to
such purpose under the supervision
of Mr. C. H. Hodges, the head-
master, that he passed the Junior
University Examination and came
home with several school prizes. At
the Townsville Grammar School he
won the half-mile and the mile run-
ning championships, and played
with the first teams in cricket and
football. When his schooldays
terminated he took over the manage-
ment of "Butcher Hill,” a post
which involved a variety of duties
ranging from the administration of
the run to such work as saddlery,
blacksmithing, carpentering, yard-
building and other necessary tasks.
As, at this period, prime cattle were
difficult to sell at 30s. per head and
good horses at £4 and £5, he worked
hard for three years without salary,
and finally, feeling the need of a
holiday, secured his father’s permis-
sion to take two saddle horses and a
pack horse with which to visit
“Southwick” Station, owned by the
old Northern family of Aplin, of
which two of his school friends, Harry
and Arthur Aplin, were members.
In June of the year 1895, he set off
with full camping outfit on the long
MR. E. C. EARL.
overland journey to the Charters
Towei s district, visiting the various
stations en route and passing through
the townships of Atherton and Her-
berton. At the Valley of Lagoons he
attended a conference of pastoralists
called to consider at what centre a


boiling-down works should be
erected, the choice lying between
Cooktown, Mareeba and Cardwell.
A day later he reached his last call-
ing place, “Bluff Downs,” and
finally, after three weeks’ constant
riding, arrived at “Southwick.”
Here he spent six weeks of winch he
has retained most pleasant mem-
ories, recalling among other circum-
stances the pleasure he and his young
friends, and an American cowboy
answering to the sobriquet of “Kan-
sas Kid,” obtained in testing the
quietness of 200 four-year-old colts
and fillies (by “Panic” and “Kelpie”
horses) that had been professionally
broken the year before. These horses
were as unruly as brumbies and
column. While engaged as a literary
contributor to the above journal, he
had occasion bo visit Cooktown, and
when there was asked to act, in con-
nection with a parliamentary elec-
tion then in progress, as presiding
officer at Rocky Diggings, on the top
of the scrubby ranges in the vicinity
of Coen and about fifty miles from
that small mining centre, the fee
being £3O from which all expenses
were to be paid. The undertaking
involved a 294 miles’ ride from Cook-
town, and —at the last stage, when
horse travelling was impossible—a
walk of six miles, the distance from
the port being 300 miles. The hos-
tile blacks were numerous in the
locality and on the day of the
papers in a rainproof valise and
started with them for their destina-
tion. By riding two- horses alter-
nately and swimming the rivers in
turn, he accomplished the 200 miles
between Coen and Laura in three
days; and boarding the train at the
latter centre, handed in his papers
at Cooktown in the time prescribed.
With the £35 resulting from this
trip and the money earned by his
pen, he had the funds needed for the
journey to Western Australia, to
which country he was destined to re-
main a stranger, however, for when
on the eve of sailing he was per-
suaded by the late Inspector Fitz-
Gerald to take charge of the Native
Police Station at Cardwell. He held
called for horsemanship more expert
than that displayed at Wild West
Shows, at one of which exhibitions,
we mention en passant as illustrative
of Mr. Earl’s expertness as a horse-
man, that he thrice mounted and
twice conquered the world-famous
buckjumper, “Dangine Grey.” From
“Southwick,” he returned to “But-
cher Hill,” but owing to continued
depression in the cattle market, he
decided to visit Western Australia in
the hope of there improving his for-
tunes. As funds were needed for
this purpose, he wrote for the
columns of the Queenslander under
the nom de flume of “Basalt,” an
account of his recent trip, for which
lie was paid at the rate of 10s. per

election a man was speared by them,
though not fatally. At the diggings
eight votes were recorded and on
his return to Coen, Mr. Earl re-
ceived telegraphed instructions to
await the arrival of another presid-
ing officer to consult with the Coen
officer as to the quickest way of re-
turning to Cooktown with the poll-
ing papers, as all the rivers between
Coen and Laura townships were in
full flood. A special fee of £5 was
offered for the delivery of these
papers in Cooktown by a certain
date. Mr. Earl was then only
twenty-two and his fellow officers
were in their fifties, so, as it was
agreed that he should negotiate the
flooded rivers, he strapped all the
the position for eleven months,
relinquishing it on receiving from
Mr. Christensen the offer of the sub-
managership of “Lammermoor”
Station—which at that time carried
a herd of 40,000 and 400 horses—the
inducement leading to his acceptance
of the post being the immediate
prospect of the managership, which
he was informed was shortly to be
vacated. Things did not turn out as
he anticipated at “Lammermoor”
and the position proved an anoma-
lous one. While engaged on this
station he was called to Townsville
to attend a supreme court case as a
witness, and from Townsville he
visited Charters Towers, where he be-
came interested in the cyanide


treatment of tailings with the result
that he proceeded to the Hodgkinson
field and obtained samples of tailings
with the view of erecting a
cyanide treatment works there. The
branch was shortly opened at Cairns,
which he eventually made his head-
quarters and soon branches were ex-
tended to every thriving centre in
the district. From a comparatively

The extent of his operations in this
has occupied many honorary sec-
retaryships and posts of a similar
nature. In 1898 he became a member
of the Barron Shire Council with
which he was associated for the

important request was placed before
the treasurer on board the “Mar-

gaged on a northern tour, and at
the same time and place Mr. Earl,
as chairman of the Harbour Board,
requested the loan of £45,000 for
the acquirement of all private

THOMAS STEWART, "Drum-
begg,” Gordonvale, via Cairns, was
born at "Drumduff Farm,” near
Drumbegg, County Donegal, Ireland,
on March 18, 1843, and is a son of
MR. T. STEWART.
the late Thomas Stewart, who, of
Irish birth and Scottish descent,
carried on farming pursuits in his
native land. In the course of its
history, dating from its earliest
association with the country, cen-
turies ago, the Stewart family has
contributed representatives to the
agricultural, manufacturing, and
commercial life of the North of
Ireland and colonists to the Empire’s
dominions in various seas. It was
as a colonist that Mr. Stewart was
destined to attain the goal of final
independence, so difficult of achieve-
ment, that is the ambition of most
right-minded and normal young men.
Though temperamentally averse to
study, he had abundant physical
energy, so his thirteenth year found
his books discarded and the lad
strenuously employed in farming
work, in which he continued to
engage until arriving at the age of
nineteen. By then he had absorbed
the subject matter of many a con-
versation, story, or letter relating to
the potentialities of the young Con-
tinent under the Southern Cross,
and, on realizing that desiring
settlers were encouraged to under-
take the long overseas voyage, he
was not slow to grasp sucb oppor-
tunities as were then afforded of
seeing a far-distant part of the
world. He set out for Brisbane,
Queensland, in the year 1864 by the
sailing ship "Young Australia,”
and was accompanied by his young
wife, to whom his marriage had then
just recently occurred. In due course
the young couple reached their
destination, whence they proceeded
in the direction of Ipswich, where
the railway was then in course of
construction, and in connection with
which the husband was shortly
engaged in cutting firewood for the
works. For his labour, however, he
received no compensation, as the
man who was to have paid him
absconded with his money. He fol-
lowed up his initial experience by
securing, in a livery stable in
MR. T. STEWART, JUN.
Ipswich, a post which he occupied
for a time. Later, attracted by the
greater remuneration offered to a
first-class bush worker, he applied
for and secured a billet as a shearer
at "Rosella” Station, on the Darling
Downs. On the conclusion of his
first shearing season, he entered the
service of the coaching firm of Cobb
and Co., whose ramifications were
interwoven with many phases of
development embraced in the early
history-making of the State. Subse-
quently he engaged in other bush
avocations, gaining a considerable
amount of valuable experience dur-
ing the first ten years of his life in
his adopted country. Throughout
the whole of this period, as in his
subsequent career, approximating
a half-century of years, in which
were experienced considerable stress
and many vicissitudes, he received
the whole-hearted co-operation of
his good wife, to whose loyal com-
radeship and practical help he
ascribes much of the success which
eventually was ceded to him. The
year 1871 saw him supporting his
family as a drover, but the mining
prospects of Gympie, then only four
years old, called to him as soon as
he was free to make a fresh start.
At Gympie he remained for a short
time, but finding his labour most
inadequately requited, he left for
the Ravenswood field early in 1872,
and ere the completion of that year
proceeded to Charters Towers, the
site of which as a goldfield had been
discovered some months before.
Here he was engaged for work at
the old Caledonia Mine, and he con-
tinued a wage-earner on the field
until the rush to the Palmer carried
him to the more recently found
centre and its sensational possibili-
ties. On the Palmer he met with
better fortune than hitherto, for he
pegged out and struck gold in a
claim which, for three years, yielded
on an average to the value of about
£4O weekly. Having exhausted his
MR. C. THOMASON.
Palmer claim, he made his way to
the Hodgkinson gold diggings, and
there, as the owner of a claim for
which he received a fair price when
it was wanted as the site for a


mill, also made good. He left the
Hodgkinson to prospect the district
outlying Port Douglas after that
township was established, and here
his quest for “the gleam” was quite
unrewarded, so he directed his
energy and capital in the channels of
dairying enterprise, purchasing
“Lolsworth” cows for his purpose
and choosing Port Douglas as the
centre of his operations. Realizing
shortly that Herberton promised
greater continuity of prosperity, he
there removed his cattle and plant
and established a connection which
afforded him a good business for
three years, at the end of which,
owing to new arrangements being
made on the station, he was obliged
to move his stock from “Evelyn,”
where he had them on agistment,
and look for other country. From
Herberton he proceeded north and
took up two blocks at the head of
the Mitchell and Barron watersheds,
which he held for seven years and
devoted to breeding. During this
time he continued to supply the
settlers of the locality and the
Native Police Camp at the Barron
Bend, near the present site of
Biboohra, with beef, and steers to
the carriers operating in the district.
In the middle eighties, the Govern-
ment having thrown open for re-
selection country which included his
run, he was again compelled to seek
new fields for his enterprise, and
this time took up some 400 square
miles of territory which he formed
and named “RookwoodJ’ afterwards
a well-known holding. He also
took up country on the Palmer
River and formed and owned
for several years the well-known
“Drumduff” Station. At “Rook-
wood” he carried on as a pastoralist
for nearly a quarter of a century,
finally disposing of the area and
entering the sugar industry in part-
nership with his son-in-law, Mr.
Charles Thomason. Now hale and
hearty at the age of eighty, he
quietly takes his part in sugar pro-
duction at “Drumbegg.” He had
a large family, of which three sons
and a daughter survive, the sons,
Thomas, William, and James B.
Stewart, who were all born in the
Far North, being prominently en-
gaged in the sugar industry in the
vicinity of Cairns. There are now
four generations of the family in
the Cook district, the pioneer,
Thomas Stewart, his son and grand-
son of the same name, and his great-
grandchild, the infant daughter of
the lastnamed. CHARLES THOMA-
SON is a native of Tasmania and
a son of a preacher of the Methodist
Church, who, a native of one of the
Shetland Islands, emigrated to the
Apple Island many years ago and
became well known in his ministerial
capacity in the Tasmanian towns of
Underwood and Lilydale, his family
having engaged in farming pursuits
in the vicinity of the former centre.
Here Mr. Thomason, of “Drura-
begg,” was educated. On reaching
manhood he came to Queensland,
and for a period was engaged in the
Chillagoe smelting works. Subse-
quently he proceeded to the Her-
berton district and was employed
for some years in prospecting for
metals. In 1913, in conjunction with
his father-in-law, Mr. Tom Stewart,
he acquired, at Fig Tree Creek, a
sugar property which the partners
sold as a well-developed concern in
1917, when they bought “Drum-
begg, ” their present home, from Mr.
William Cannon. “Drumbegg” com-
prises about 3,000 acres and is
devoted to both cane production and
cattle grazing. Messrs. Stewart and
Thomason have a farm of 13,000
acres near Aloomba, which is known
as “Tire Gorge” Farm, and from
both their properties harvest about

of Mr. Thomas Stewart, and has a

numerous old Cornish records point-
ing to this fact and to the circum-
stance that the name is peculiar to
the south-western County, being
absent from annals of other parts
of England. His father, the late W.
Saunders Alley, founded in Aus-
tralia the branch of the family which
has played such a large part in con-
nection with the development of
Northern Queensland, having, after
several voyages from the Old
World to the young Continent as
one of the company of an immigrant
ship, been irresistibly attracted to the
country. A native of Cornwall, the
late gentleman hailed to the land of
the Southern Cross from Portsmouth,
and was for long identified with the
early history of Brisbane, where, at
separate times, he was the proprietor
of the Ship Inn, the Queen’s, and
the Duke of Cornwall Hotels. He
was always more or less associated
with water transport, and we find it
chronicled in old records that he was
the owner of a line of punts plying
between Brisbane and Ipswich.
Later, when the Colony was estab-
lished and the development of the
mineral resources of the present State
was begun, he was among those who
played their part in the making of
mining history, being one of the
early arrivals at Calliope when that
centre was proclaimed a gold diggings
in 1863. He joined in several other
gold rushes of the period, and at
Blackall, Mount Perry, and else-
where interested himself in copper
ventures also. In the seventies he
was engaged at Mount Perry, and
from there he proceeded to tire Far
North, settling at Cairns some time
previous to 1877. In Cairns he
became well known as the owner of
two vessels—a sailing boat and a
steam launch—which he plied for
trade on the Barron River between
Cairns and Smithfield. In his trading
and shipping operations he was there
shortly joined by his son, Mr. G.
G. Alley, then a youth of fifteen,
who had preceded him to the North
(though not to Cairns) in company
with Mr. Richard Blackwell, of whom
more hereafter. A year later, in
1878, he joined forces with Mr.
Blackwell and became engaged in
timber-getting in the Barron River
district. The descendants of the
Messrs. Alley and Blackwell may
claim for them the honour of being
the pioneers of this part of Northern
Queensland, for when the three —
the father, his son, and son-in-law—
came to Cairns the present pro-
sperous town was only a year old and
Atherton and Herberton were non-
existent. The first team of bullocks
was brought from Cairns to the
locality on the Mulgrave on which
the town of Gordonvale now stands
more than a year after the advent of
the pioneer Alley to the former
centre, this being in 1878, and the
journey occupying a full fortnight.
MR. G. G. ALLEY.
In 1879 Mr. W. S. Alley took up the
first selection on the Mulgrave River,
a block consisting of one square
mile, taking possession of his pro-
perty before Nelson township, now
MR, W. S. ALLEY.
Gordonvale, had come into existence.
The block later became the site of the
present Mulgrave Mill. When the
discovery of tin caused the found-
ation of Herberton in 1880, he


erected tlie Riverstone Hotel on
the track to the newly-established
township, and became the licensee of
the property. This old hostelry
housed many notabilities in its day,
MR. R. R. ALLEY.
and continued to be the home of its
proprietor until his death some nine
years later. Both the late gentleman
and his good wife are buried here.
A son and two daughters sur-
vive them, the younger daughter,
Mary, having married Mr. Thomas
Williams, now a resident of Gordon-
vale. The elder daughter, Sarah, is
the widow of the late Richard Black-
well, a native of St. Just, Cornwall,
to whom her marriage occurred in
1873. Mr. Blackwell, who was a
descendant of old Celtic stock, came
to Australia at the age of twenty-
five, having previously spent five
years in America. In Cornwall he
had some experience of mining, a
form of industry which had occupied
his progenitors also, and it was the
wonderful mineral resources of Aus-
tralia which, in the late sixties,
tempted him from America. He dis-
embarked at Rockhampton, and pro-
ceeding to Peak Downs, there found
an ample, if not a profitable field
for his industry. Gold, copper,
silver, and tin mining occupied him
in the central districts of Queensland
until the year 1877, when, in com-
pany with Mr. G. G. Alley, then a
lad in his early teens, he overlanded
with horse and waggon teams from
Mount Perry to Brisbane, where he
embarked with his outfit for Cook-
town, thence starting out on the
overland journey over rough country
to the Hodgkinson goldfield, where,
with his young partner, he was
engaged in quartz carrying for about
a year. At the end of this period
he proceeded to Cairns, and, in part-
nership with the late founder of the
Alley family and his son, applied his
energies to timber-getting. In the
course of the connection, which is
referred to in the preceding pages,
he accepted contracts for log cutting
and rafting down the inlet to Cairns
consignments of the valuable cedar
which abounded in the scrub lands
of the district, the work occupying
some years. George Gorham Alley,
the only son of this fine old pioneer,
was born at South Brisbane on May
12, 1862, and had the advantage of
such schooling as was available in
MR. G. K. ALLEY.
Rockhampton and Mount Perry in
the sixties and seventies. When still
a child, his experiences in mining
began, for he and his sister were
able to jointly earn 10s. weekly by
washing for alluvial gold at Calliope.
In the year 1877, when he was at the
age of fifteen, he undertook, with his
brother-in-law, the late Richard
Blackwell, the overland journey from
Mount Perry to Brisbane, thence to
Cooktown and on to the Hodgkinson,
as already described, finally leaving
the Hodgkinson to join the late
William Saunders Alley in his
trading operations in Cairns.
Here he subsequently obtained
a post in a store, the duties
of which occupied him until 1878,
when, joining his father and Mr.
Blackwell in the timber-getting
venture before referred to, he
became engaged in the forests of
the Barron River. The experience he
then gained stood him in good stead
when, in the late eighties, he estab-
lished himself in the timber industry-
on his own account. Early in the
nineties he began his present career
as a cane farmer on lands which
passed to' him as the late gentleman’s
heir. The development of his pro-
perty and outside interests connected
with the sugar industry have since
claimed the greater part of his time
and energies, leaving him little
leisure for participation in matters
of more public import, though he has
for long identified himself with
Masonic affairs, being a Past Master
of the Pyramid Lodge, Gordonvale.
Mr. Alley was twice married, on the
first occasion to Isabella Mary,
daughter of the late James Burke,
and on the second, in 1897, to Mary
Ellen, daughter of Mr. James Healy
(also deceased), who was one of the
early officials of Townsville and con-
nected with the Queensland Civil
Service for many years. His family
consists of five sons and a daughter.
The former, of whom two were the
issue of his first marriage, are all
engaged in the sugar industry in the
district outlying Gordonvale. His
son, George Kenneth, served his

years of the period occupied by the
titanic struggle of 1914-18, and

JOHN CANNON, J.P., “Ken-
sington,” Gordonvale, Cairns,
Northern Queensland, was born at
Keswick, in the Lakes District,
MR. J. CANNON.
Cumberland, on August 15, 1868,
and is the third son of the late John
Cannon, formerly a well-known
farmer of the north-eastern border
renowned huntsman, John Peel,
whose doings have been the theme
of both song and story. The owner
of “Kensington” was educated at a
local semi-private school whose prin-
cipal, Mr. Foster Waite, was well
known in educational circles as a
man of exceptional culture and high
ideals. He remained under the
supervision of this gentleman until
reaching the age of sixteen, when,
having heard from his brother, Mr.
William Cannon, of the unbounded
resources of Australia, he set out by
the s.s. “Roma” for this' country,
arriving in Townsville, Queensland,
in the year 1884. A week or two
later, having proceeded further
north, he became engaged as a dairy
employe at “Green Hills,” a pro-
perty lying in the vicinity of Cairns
and owned by Mr. Thomas Mackey,
one of the first settlers to engage in
the dairying and sugar industries
in the district of which that town is
the centre. On this farm he worked
for less than a year at a wage of
15s. a week, relinquishing his post
after the establishment of a partner-
ship—the basis of an independent
dairying venture —between himself
and his brother. By purchase from
Messrs. Mackey and Anderson, his
former employers, who at that time
Messrs. Cannon secured the outfit
necessary to carry on the business in
which they later became so well
known, and to add grist to the mill

purchased on terms a pack team of
horses and mules, which engaged the
energies of Mr. John Cannon as a

were engaged in supplying milk to
the town of Cairns, of twenty cows
at the rate of £6 per head, their
calves, and a horse and cart, the
their dairying interests. The scene
of the former’s operations lay at
first between Cairns and Herberton,
but later contracting with the firm


of John Moffat & Co. for the car-
riage of maize and general produce,
he became well known to the settlers
of the Muldiva, Boomerang, Mont
Albion, and Irvinebank districts,
the extent of his contracts from Mr.
Moffat keeping him fully employed
in these localities. In the year 1893
Mr. John Cannon purchased the
area embraced in “Kensington,” his
present property; he took up his
residence thereon and turned his
whole attention to cane-growing
when the Government of the day, by
subsidizing the erection of the Mul-
grave Mill, placed the sugar industry
on a sound footing in the district,
since when he has continued to
supply the mill with the raw pro-
duct. He is one of the founders of
this mill, and, since the retirement
of his brother from office, has occu-
pied a place on its directorate. His
partnership with Mr. William
Cannon ended by mutual consent in
the year 1900, having at that time
been in existence for some sixteen
years. Through the thirty-eight
years of his sojourn in Northern
Queensland he has consistently done
all that was possible to aid pro-
gression in the districts in which his
interests were centred, his integrity
and sound business reputation hav-
ing been recognized during the ad-
ministration of the Denham Govern-
ment by his creation to the
Justiceship of the Peace. For the
past twelve years he has been a
councillor of the Cairns Shire, and
his name is well to the fore in con-
nection with many movements insti-
tuted for the welfare of the com-
munity, particularly such as have
for their objective charity, patriot-
ism, or the encouragement of in-
dustry. It may be safely said that
those engaged in sugar production
in the Mulgrave have no more
energetic supporter than Mr. John
Cannon. He has now two farms
which yield a tonnage in the vicinity
of 3,000 annually. Of politics he is
a keen student, and his desire for
the welfare of the country takes
practical shape in his work as a
member of the executive of the local
branch of the Country Party. A
Freemason, he has been preferred
from time to time for high honours
in the craft, and he is counted
among the leading Carpentaria dis-
trict members of the fraternity. In
realms of sport, he has been no less
prominent than in the industrial
world of the Far North, standing
strongly in the interests of clean
racing as president of the Cairns
Jockey Club and vice-president and
honorary judge of the Gordonvale
Racing Club. He was a patron of
the former body for many years ere
being voted to the office of president.
In the year 1901 he married Louisa,
daughter of the late Nicholas Beig,
and previously widow of Mr. K.
Furste, who was a member of a
noble family of Saxony, which ex-
tended a branch to Australia in the
year 1898. Mrs. Cannon’s father,
the late Nicholas Beig, was a native
of Alsace, and hailed to Australia
from Saarubrticken, a manufactur-
ing town on the Rhine. Of the union
was born, at Highleigh, near
Cairns, a son, Walter, who, on the
completion of his education, which
was conducted at the Brisbane
Grammar School, returned to the
parental rooftree and entered the
sugar industry, in which he is now
engaged as bis father’s assistant,

dwelling, occupies a delightful site at
a distance of four miles from Gordon-
vale and sixteen miles from Cairns,
in grounds beautified by lawns,
shrubs, and shade trees. It com-
mands on every side exquisite views
of richly-cultivated farming lands
that stretch away in the misty dis-
tance to a border of rugged ranges.


WILLIAM CANNON, “White
Rock,’’ Cairns, was born in Cumber-
land in 1865, and is the second son
of the late John Cannon, who,
sprung from a very old English
farming family, followed in Cumber-
land the calling of his forbears. On
the maternal side he is directly
descended from John Peel, whose
name is perpetuated in a famous old
hunting song. He was educated at
Bassenthwaith Halls, Keswick, in
his native Shire, and on concluding
his schooldays applied himself to
farming pursuits. Tire monotonous
character of the life, however, was
but little congenial to a lad of his
temperament, so he availed himself
of the facilities for emigration which
were afforded at the time to those
desirous of settling in Australia.
When he took this step he was only
seventeen years of age, the date of
his arrival in the country being 1882,
and his first post was as an employe
of a dairyman in Townsville. He was
so occupied, at a remuneration of
15s. weekly, for four months ere he
realized that better chances for the
newcomer lay further north where
settlement was younger. Securing a
position at a weekly wage of £l, he
thenceforward worked with the rea-
lization of the excellent opportuni-
ties for enterprise on a small scale
waiting investors in Queensland.
With the knowledge that independ-
ence was to be most quickly gained
by steady work and a saving hand,
he denied himself much during his
first two years in the country, with
the result that at the end of that
time he had accumulated the sum of
£64. This amount he applied to the
purchase of twenty cows at £6 per
head, the balance to be paid in work.
In 1885 he established a partnership
with his brother, Mr. John Cannon,
who had joined him about twelve
months after his own advent to the
country, and, with the nucleus of
stock referred to, he started a
dairying proposition in 1887. Shortly
afterwards the Messrs. Cannon pur-
chased, on terms, a pack team of
horses and mules, with which John
engaged in their joint interests as a
carrier between Cairns and Her-
berton for some years. The brothers’
dairying,, interests continued to be
identical until the year 1900, which
marks a disastrous period for the
man on the land owing to the tick
pest which preceded, and the drought
that followed it. A mutual dissolu-
tion of partnership was then agreed
upon, and the subject of our memoir
took over, with its liabilities, the
dairy farm, of which he retained
possession until the year 1917, when
he disposed of it to the Messrs.

with whom he was associated in the
interests of the farming; population.
He severed his connection with the
mill in 1917. As a dairy and sugar
farmer, he experienced many “ups
and downs,” but by hard work,
industry, and thrift overcame every
obstacle which came in his way,
eventually finding himself in the
possession of a fair competence and
free to spend the remainder of his
life in quiet retirement. Among the
residents of the Cook district, few
are more deserving of the title of
pioneer than Mr. Cannon, who was
one of the first settlers to fell scrub
in the now highly-cultivated and
prolific watershed of the Mulgrave.
Mr. Cannon is a member of the
Masonic fraternity, and, as one of
those forming the bodies of the
Cairns Shire and Municipal Councils,
has actively participated in com-
munal affairs, further evincing the
possession of a most public spirit by
upholding such movements as he
considers genuinely calculated to
advance the welfare of the district.
A believer in sport, he is a well-
known member of most racing bodies
of the North and encourages every
form of outdoor recreation. “White
Rock,” his present residence, is
modern and most artistically ap-
pointed, and situated five miles from
Cairns in the shadow of .the elevation
from which it takes its name. Past
the grounds of this beautiful home,
which are studded with shade trees
and ornamented with lawns, shrubs,
and other foliage, runs the Gordon-
vale line of railway that serves the

Cannon married in the year 1904
Mary Claridge, daughter of the late
Thomas Whitman, who took part in
the early settlement of Queensland.
This gentleman overlanded to the
Cook district from Rockhampton
about a quarter of a century ago,
and his family has since continued
to be favourably known in Cairns
and Port Douglas. The union pro-
duced two sons, William Jack Whit-
man and George Cannon, and four
daughters, Phyllis, Betty, Ruth,
and Nancy Cannon.


WILLIAM SAMUEL JOHN-
STON, “Drumsara,” Mossman, was
born in Bundaberg, Queensland, in
the seventies, and is the third son
of Mr. Samuel Johnston, who helped
MR. S. JOHNSTON.
to make history in various parts of
the State, though perhaps most
notably in Bundaberg, in the dis-
trict outlying which he was one of
the very earliest arrivals. This well-
known pioneer made his advent from
the Old World to Victoria in the
year 1858, and like so many enter-
prising immigrants of his time made
his way to the gold diggings, thence-
forward following the industry in
the South for the two succeeding
years. His wandering as a gold
miner eventually brought him to
Queensland, where the event was to
pj.QYO pun one of the most useful of
the pioneers to whose efforts the
State owes the rapid development of
hitherto unsettled and practically
unknown portions of her territory.
When Rockhampton was in its in-
fancy he owned a sawmill on the
Fitzroy River reaches, in the vicinity
of the town. After a period spent
in Rockhampton he proceeded to the
Burnett, on the northern bank of
which he purchased from a selector
named Watson a site for a sawmill.
It will be found on reference to the
historical section of this work that
he made his advent to the Burnett
in 1867, bringing his sawmill in
the same year by the ketch “Violet,"
the first vessel to enter the river.
During 1868 the town of Bundaberg
was established by the Government,
the site being suggested, doubtless,
by the presence of the small settle-
ment, comprised of the Stewarts,
Watsons, Alexanders, and Mr. John-
ston, already in occupation. Mr.
Johnston is a pioneer of the sugar
industry in the Bundaberg district,
having become the owner of a mill
and plantation in the very early
days. Many years later, when settle-
ment had expanded to the Far
North, he showed his enterprise by
extending his interests to the dis-
trict outlying Port Douglas, becom-
ing the owner of “Drumsara,” a
sugar estate in the Mossman River
watershed and in the vicinity of the
town so named. He reared four sons
and eight daughters, and is now the
head of a family of children and
grandchildren who are all residents
of Queensland. Two of his sons, the
subject of our memoir and Mr.
Samuel Johnston, jun., are occupied
in the sugar industry in the Mossman
district. One is engaged as a solicitor
in Nanango and another in the
sawmiiling trade at Kingaroy. Mr.
W. S. Johnston is an “old boy” of
the Rockhampton Grammar School.
On the conclusion of his studies
there he returned to Bundaberg
and took up duties in the timber
industry at his father’s sawmill,
being later given at the plantation
and sugar mill opportunities of
gaining a knowledge of the methods
then practised of growing and

manufacturing sugar. This was in the
days of kanaka labour, and for some
time he occupied the post of field
manager for the pioneer, on whose
behalf in 1908 he proceeded to Port
Douglas, a town situated about
1,000 miles north of Brisbane, and
thence to “Drumsara,” the pro-
perty owned by Mr. Johnston, sen.,
to the working of which he has since
devoted his chief energies. While
acting on his father’s behalf at
“Drumsara,” which is the largest
sugar estate in the Mossman water-
shed, he became the owner of
“Givelda,” a property devoted to
the same industry and situated in
the vicinity of the larger area.
Since his advent to the dis-
trict twenty-four years ago, Mr. W.
S. Johnston has been closely iden-
tified with all that counts for com-
munal advancement for the progress
of that part of the State in which
his interests are centred, and, as one
of the directors of the Mossman
Central Mill, of the industry which
those interests represent. He lends
his encouragement to all forms of
clean sport, particularly to racing,
being a patron of the local turf club.
In the year 1910 he married Kate,
daughter of the late Ebenezer Cow-
ley, a well-known pioneer of the
Herbert River, and has a family of
four sons.

JOHN CHRISTOPHERSON
NICHOLSON, “Groveley,” Sarina,
was born at Enoggera, Brisbane, on
July 16, 1866, and is the only sur-
viving son of Mr. John Nicholson, a

sixties, who, now in his ninety-third
year, resides in retirement at his
home at Red Hill, Brisbane, having

as recently as the year 1920, at the
age of ninety-one, relinquished his
duties as district registrar of births,
marriages and deaths. Mr. John
Nicholson was an active citizen of
Moreton Bay in the days of the then
Colony’s first Governor, Sir George
Ferguson Bowen, who was present at
the christening of Mr. John C. Nic-
holson of “Groveley.” Born in
England, he was educated at Ciren-
cester College and made his advent
to Australia in the year 1860 from
Salisbury, Wiltshire, where the old
family from which he was descended
was then established, having come
there from Northumberlandshire.
His journey to Australia was
prompted by medical opinion that
life in a warmer climate than Eng-
land provided was essential to his
health, and so completely was his
main object achieved under the
kindly skies of Queensland, that
after a long and useful career in his
adopted country he is still hale and

hearty at four score years and twelve.
Shortly after his arrival at Moreton
Bay he acquired a property at Sam-
son Vale, a district vicinal the
metropolis, on which he engaged in
fruit-growing for some time, the
period of his activities in this dis-
trict being worthily commemorated
by the edifice still standing as the
Groveley Church of England, in the
erection of which he was chiefly
instrumental, presenting the land
and finding most of the funds for the
purpose. On leaving Samson Vale
he became a pioneer of the sugar
industry at Caboolture. Later, he
joined the Civil Service, and, about
half a century ago, when Mackay
was still in its infancy, was appointed
Clerk of Petty Sessions there, sub-
sequently filling similar positions at
Bundaberg, Townsville and Rock-
hampton. His family consisted of

Mackay during a storm. In the
year 1880, while still resident at
Mackay, he selected a block of coun-
try which he subsequently presented
to his surviving son, Mr. Jolm


Christopherson Nicholson. Educated
at Mackay, the last-mentioned gentle-
man left school when in his middle
teens and immediately interested
himself in agrarian pursuits on this
Provisional Board and the Board of
Directors—positions which he has
ever since occupied. Such facts are
sufficiently illuminating as to the
part he has played in advancing the
of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.,
at Homebush. Mr. Bentley, who
has been a resident of the Mackay
district for nearly forty comes
of a Yorkshire family, the County
property, which, named “Groveley’’
and consisting of nearly 800 acres,
it was his intention to develop as a
grazing concern, but, as the country
became more closely settled and the
potentialities of the sugar industry
more apparent, he disposed of a por-
tion of it and took up other adjoin-
ing properties more suitable for
sugar-growing. He later acquired
grazing interests, however, on a
small property situated on Alligator
Creek, near Sarina. As success
attended his efforts—which were at
first rewarded only by dint of perse-
verance in the face of many setbacks
which necessitated his turning his
hand to all sorts of work, such as
horse-breaking, kangaroo shooting,
etc. to enable' him to carry on—he

established around Mackay, and
rightly suggest that every movement
likely to advance the particular dis-
trict in which his interests are
centred has met with his most ener-
getic support. In the past he
represented the No. 2 Division of the
Pioneer Shire Council, and ever
since the inception of the Sarina
Shire Council in 1911 he has held
office as a member of that body.
He has for long exercised magister-
ial duties as a Justice of the Peace,
having been gazetted to the office
under the Philp Administration.
The “sport of Kings” has in him a
strong advocate, and in his recrea-
tion be displays the same quality of
keenness that characterizes his more
serious undertakings. He is a mem-
ber of the Sarina Race Club and the

the name. The union of and
Mrs. Nicholson has resulted in a
family of three sons and two
daughters. Of the sons, the eldest,
Guy Fulford Nicholson, represented
the Northern Queensland branch of
the family at the western theatre of
the Great War of 1914-18, having
enlisted and been accepted for
service with the Australian Imper-
ial Forces abroad immediately on
reaching man’s estate. He upheld
the traditions of his race on the
Somme, at Ypres and in various
other engagements in which the
Australians made history in the
course of the great struggle, return-
ing to Australia and the paternal
rooftree at its close. At time of
writing, he, with his younger
brother, John Robert, is engaged in

the administration and further
development of “Groveley.” The
younger son, Christopherson, is yet
a student.


WILLIAM CHARLES GRIF-
FIN, J.P., “Somerset” Farm
Gordonvale, via Cairns, was born or
April 5, 1872, and comes of a
Somersetshire family which settlec
in that County from Ireland, where
his forbears had their homes for
many generations ere political
reasons and the greater industria
facilities of England caused the
establishment of a branch of the line
across the water. Mr. W. C.
Griffin’s birthplace in Somersetshire
is Glastonbury. His education was
pursued at the National School of
Everoreech, in the same County,
where his father was employed as an
officer of the Somersetshire and
Dorset Railway Co. He concluded
his school career at an early age,
being given employment on a farm
before he had reached his teens.
Until after the completion of his
seventeenth year, he continued to
gain experience of both sheep and
cattle in Somersetshire under the late
Captain J. D. Sherstou, a brother-
in-law of Field-Marshal Earl
Roberts, late Commander-in-Chief
of the British Army. While thus
engaged the potentialities of Aus-
tralia were brought very prominently
to hie notice, and he decided to try
his fortune in the younger coun-
try. His decision was hardly
formed ere preparations were made
for his journey, which, in due
course, was accomplished by the s.e.
“Tara,” this particular trip being
the ship’s maiden voyage. He landed
in Townsville on March 26, 1890,
where, being a lad of light weight
and build, he was destined to dis-
appointment in the matter of quickly
securing employment of the sort he
looked for. Confident of his ability
to do a man’s work, he therefore pro-
ceeded west, having refused a billet
as an hotel employe, the only one
which offered in response to his
applications in Townsville. His
journey west ended at “Savannah
Downs,” where, meeting with better
fortune, he secured a post among
cattle, and in the course of the fol-
lowing five years received full recog-
nition for his ability by steady pro-
motion and finally the appointment
of head stockman, which he held
until the continuance of drought
conditions and industrial trouble due
to strikes prompted his return to the
Motherland. With this objective, he
actually resigned his post and pro-
ceeded to Cairns, but, finding that
preparations were in progress for the
erection of the Mulgrave Central
Mill, he decided to defer his
departure and seize the opportunity
of gaining an insight into the condi-
tions of the sugar industry in this
district. As a means to an end,

of timber sleepers and other material
necessary for the formation of the
mill, and on the completion of this
work invested his savings in a small
farm in the vicinity of Gordonvale,
a township lying 14 miles from
Cairns. His newly-acquired pro-
perty, to which he gave the name of
“Somerset” Farm, consisted of some
7b acres of slightly-improved agricul-
tural land, and to its further devel-
opment he immediately devoted him-
self. After ten years marked by
much sacrifice and the most strenuous
labour, he was able to consider him-
self upon a solid financial footing
and in the position to make addi-
tional land purchases in the same
district in which his original acquire-
ment is situated. These investments
fully justified his judgment, and his
landed operations now permit of the
production of over 2,000 tons of
cane annually. To his sugar interests
are added others involved in real
estate in various parts of the district
outlying Gordonvale, and his activi-
ties extend to business connected
with the Mulgrave Mill, of which he
is a director. In public life he has
been well to the fore, his fine quali-
ties of citizenship being of the kind
that are among the greatest assets
a district can possess. He was
gazetted a Justice of the Peace under
the Kidston Administration, and in
his judicial capacity accomplishes
considerable amount of work on the
local Bench of Magistrates, of which
he is chairman. As a member oi
the Cairns Shire Council he has for
more than fifteen years past aidec
many progressive movements formu-
lated by that body, and, since 1908,
has been associated with the Cairns
Harbour Board, of which he was
chairman for four years. Of the
local School of Arts and State School
Committees he is president, and his
support is tendered to various
charitable or patriotic movements.
He is a founder of the Farmers’
Association of the Cairns district,
and since its inception has held office
either as president, vice-president, or
honorary secretary of the institution,
being its present president. At the
various conferences of the Australian
Sugar Producers’ Association he has
frequently acted as the representative
of the farmers settled around Cairns,
and he encourages all forms of in-
dustry as president of the Cairns
Pastoral and Agricultural Associa-
tion. Enthusiasts in rifle shooting,
racing, football, cricket, tennis, and
other outdoor recreations find in him
a hearty supporter, among his prin-
cipal predilections being the first-
named sport, apparent in the fact
that he was captain of the Mulgrave
Rifle Club for ten years. Racing also
holds for him the attraction it always
has for the horse lover, and both the
Cairns and Gordon vale Jockey Clubs
include him in their lists of members,
and he fulfils the functions of judge
in the latter body. During 1911 Mr,
Griffin visited the Motherland and
Canada, and in 1914 toured New
Zealand, on both occasions of his
absence seizing the opportunity of
visiting many important manufac-
turing centres and examining sources
of investment and industrial condi-
tions, returning to Australia with
the conviction that his adopted
country is unequalled in regard to
its resources, its facilities for indi-
vidual advancement, and the general
salubrity of its climate. In the
past he contested, though un-
successfully, the Cairns seat with
Mr. McCormack, the Home Sec-
retary, who' was then Speaker of
the House. Mr. Griffin married in
the year 1903 Christina, daughter of
the late Claus Moller, and has a
family of two sons and four daugh-
ters. Mr. Moller was a mining
pioneer of the Palmer and Herberton
districts and one of the oldest iden-
tities of Cairns, having hailed to
Queensland from Schleswig-Holstein.

JOHN GEORGE ROBBINS,

records pointing to the fact that it
has been identified with the farming
life of the County for centuries. An
intense love of travel and adventure
has ever been characteristic of the
Robbins family, numerous members
of which in past times braved the
elements in the wooden walls of Old
England and returned to their
Somersetshire homes with wonderful
tales to recount of the marvels of
other lands. Probably that same
spirit of adventure actuated the
departure from England of Mr. J.
G. Robbins, who at the age of
twenty set out from Bristol for the
far-distant Continent of Australia;
and of his father, Mr. James Rob-
bins, who joined him eight years
later, when the son established him-
self on the land. The latter arrived
in Melbourne in November of the
year 1871 and secured employment
in the meat trade, only being a short
time in the Victorian capital when
gold, in payable quantities, was dis-
covered at the site which then became
Charters Towers and loomed largely
in the public vision as an important
mining centre, drawing Mr. Rob-
bins, with hundreds of other
southern men, to the scene which so
quickly pulsed with the throbbing
life of a populous and thriving town.
At Charters Towers he followed the
“gleam” with varying fortune until
the Palmer diggings were proclaimed,
when, shouldering his swag, he
started on the overland route to
Georgetown, and thence to the far
northern river. Malaria hampered
his enterprise on the Palmer, which,
though owning an excellent claim,
he was forced to leave in order to
avoid the fate of three of his mates
who succumbed to this malady a few
months after contracting it. Seeing
that his health was likely to be
permanently affected if he continued
to pioneer the mining industry, he
turned hie attention to agriculture,
in 1874 taking a post on “Beamer
Side” Plantation, on the Lower
Herbert River, at a wage of £1 per
week. This he left for work offering
better remuneration, and ere the
advent of the eighties, in charge of
a Government horse team, was asso-
ciated with a construction party
engaged in making public roads, this
being before the time of Shire
Councils. One of his last posts in
connection with road-making was on
the construction of the route con-
necting Cairns with the Hodgkinson.
Having always before him the goal
of independence, Mr. Robbins, by
dint of industry and thrift, found
himself after some years in a posi-
tion to make a start on the land, and
took up, in conjunction with the
late John James Montgomery, the
block on which his homestead still
stands. These two were comrades in
the best sense of the word and con-
tinued to work together until the
time of Mr. Montgomery’s death,

originally grew fodder for teams, and
maize, rice, and other cereals, and
when properly established carried on
a fairly good trade in fruit. When
the sugar industry was put on a


payable basis in the locality they
devoted their land to cane, the cul-
ture of which has since been its
mainstay. For many years they had
a very hard struggle not only on
account of their distance from mar-
kets, but owing to the adverse con-
ditions which invariably accompany
early settlement, not the least trying
of which was the unfriendly disposi-
tion of the aborigines (who in this
district were cannibalistic in tend-
ency), which made necessary con-,
tinual watchfulness against treach-
erous attacks. Mr. Bobbins’ father
resided with him for twenty years
of his sojourn in his adopted country,
assisting in the farming operations
on “Mayfield” almost to the time of
his death. Industry and indomitable
perseverance of the kind which com-
mands success were marked traits in
the characters of Messrs. Robbins
and Montgomery, and step by step
they improved their financial posi-
tion until complete independence was
reached. Now, in the winter of his
days, the subject of this memoir
enjoys the comforts which are the
fruits of his career of more than fifty
years in Australia, and the universal
affection and respect which his
upright dealings and his kindly
personality have earned for him.
His success is shared by the
good lady who played well her part
as a wife and comrade in the early
days of his pioneering, and yet metes
out that hospitality for which the
home of this couple has always been
noted. Mr. Robbins’ work for the
good of the community and progress
of the district, though always
effected unobtrusively, has contri-
buted largely to these ends.
His three sons are also en-
gaged in agriculture, conducting
operations on their own farms and
combining energies to work success-
fully the old home acres, showing
how much may be achieved by co-
operative effort. The eldest was
accepted for military service soon
after war was declared in 1914, but
was subsequently discharged on the
decision of the military authorities
that his health was not up to pre-
scribed requirements. Situated six
miles from Port Douglas and com-
manding most exquisite land views,
the “Mayfield” homestead, beauti-
fied by grove upon grove of orange,
mandarin, mango, and other fruit
trees, has for its background the
picturesque coastal range and a
frontage to the Mowbray River,
shown in the foreground of the
accompanying picture.

JOHN SAMUEL DUNNING
CREES, “Ferndale,” Port Douglas,
Northern Queensland, was born at
Honiton, Devonshire, England, on
June 8, 1848. The eldest son of the
THE LATE J. CREES.
late John Crees, he is descended
from a family which had its home
in Devonshire for several genera-
tions, its foundation in Australia
resulting from the desire of the last-
mentioned gentleman, who was
engaged in butchering in his native
Shire, to secure for his wife and
children a larger competence than
accrued to his efforts in the Old
World. Imjmessed by the stories of
the sensational gold finds of 1851,
the late John Crees was drawn hither
with the first rush to Ballarat. He
made the journey from England by
the sailing ship "Lightning,” which
accomplished the run in sixty-two
days—the shortest time on record
for a sailing ship. Shortly after his
arrival, perceiving that trade offered
more stable prospects on the thickly-
populated field than did the more
attractive calling of the miner, he
opened a butcher’s shop, and for
many years continued to engage in
the calling to which he had been
trained. In 1867, when the dis-
covery of gold by an old miner
named James Nash was followed by
a vast influx of population to what
is now the important town of
Gympie, the pioneer Crees was
among those who hastened to the
field. Here, also, he started a
butchery. Later, with the discovery
of the coveted metal at the present
site of Ravenswood and Rochford,
lie became identified with the devel-
opment of those fields. Mackay also
knew him for a period, and in this
progressive Northern town, encour-
aged by the enterprise of his brother-
in-law, Mr. John Spillar, the pioneer
of the sugar industry in the South
Kennedy district, he invested in cane
lands. Rochford was the scene of his
last years, and from here he joined
the Great Majority after a sojourn
of more than fifty years in the
country of his adoption, leaving a
name of which his descendants have
just reason to feel proud. John S.
D. C rees, of "Ferndale,” pioneer
and son of a pioneer, left his native

of his near kin by his mother in
1854, about two years after his
father’s advent to the country. The
family accomplished the voyage by
the sailing ship “Sea Breeze,” and
in due course joined the late John
Crees at Ballarat, where the subject
of our memoir was educated. He is
an "old boy” of the Ballarat
Grammar School, which he attended
until of an age to enter the clerical
side of commercial life. After a
period spent with a firm at Ballarat,
he took a position in his father’s
butchery, and later, having become
au fait with the trade and its possi-
bilities, started in the same busi-
ness on his own account. He was
still in his twenties when he disposed
of his Ballarat interests and came to
Gympie, where the late John Crees
was already established, and here he
combined storekeeping and butcher-
ing, carrying on at the southern field
until he saw better prospects at
Ravenswood, then an infant town-
ship. In Ravenswood he was engaged
in butchering with the firm of Plant
and Dear, with which he was associ-
ated until the discovery of payable
gold on the Palmer River in the
Ear North caused a rush to the site
of the present diggings and a severe
setback to trade in the town which
had sprung up around the previously
discovered field. From Ravenswood
he proceeded to Rochford, where he
purchased a butchering business that
he personally conducted for about
four years, at the end of which
period, in 1876, he made his advent
to Port Douglas, en route to the
then newly discovered Hodgkinson
goldfield. Circumstances interven-
ing, he did not carry out his original
intention of proceeding inland, but,
instead, settled to dairying on a farm
in the vicinity of the Port. Deciding
to make a permanent home in the
district, he eventually selected a
block on the waterway now bearing
his name—Crees Creek—and, desig-
nating his property "Ferndale,”
carried on fruit-growing and dairy-
ing, and, as a side issue, agriculture,
until the erection of the Mossman

Central Mill had proved to land-
holders the advisability of devoting
their areas to cane culture. Since
then sugar has been the chief pro-
duct of "Ferndale.” Mr. Crees,


sen., has by his activity in public
affairs earned recognition as one of
the Mossman district’s most public-
spirited citizens. He is a councillor
of the Douglas Shire, with which he
has been officially associated for
many years. In Masonic circles he
is also prominently known, being a
Past Master of the Port Douglas
Lodge, E.C., and an erstwhile holder
of many official honours of the craft.
Mrs. Crees has been associated with
her husband in charitable move-
ments and was notably to the fore
among the voluntary workers who so
nobly assisted in this district during
the Great War. A native of Oxford-
shire, England, this lady, whose
maiden name was Louisa Smith, came
to Australia over fifty years ago. At
“Ferndale,” which was selected
from the first cotmtry thrown open
for settlement in the district, she
shared the sacrifices and hardships
wlrich were the lot of the early
settlers, and the anxieties which
were continually present owing to
the dangerous disposition of the
blacks, who in the early days were
congregated in great numbers here-
abouts and worked continual havoc

“Fairymount,” Mossman, Northern
Queensland. Paternally descended
from an old English Yorkshire
family and, on the distaff side, from

stock of purely Irish origin, the
Messrs. Pringle are sons of the late
John Pringle, a pioneer who played
a notable part in connection with
the settlement and development of
MR. J. PRINGLE.
that part of the Far North of which
Port Douglas and Mossman are
centres. Mr. John Pringle was the
youngest of three brothers who,
accompanied by a sister, came to
Australia considerably over half a
century ago, and combining their
resources invested in land on the
Clarence River, New South Wales.
These brothers engaged in mixed
farming for a period, but finally,
realizing that the younger Colony of
Queensland must provide greater
scope for any form of landed enter-
prise, disposed of their original in-
terests and proceeded northwards.
They became identified with the
agricultural development of the dis-
trict outlying the town of Bunda-
berg, and the two elder, Nicholas
and James Pringle, eventually
ranked among the southern pioneers
of the sugar industry. The youngest
of the trio, John Pringle, separating
his interests from those of his
brothers, struck out for himself
MR. J. M. PRINGLE.
when the country comprised in the
Mossman watershed came to be
recognized as a promising agricul-
tural district. He travelled from the
south by boat to Port Douglas, and,
journeying inland, selected the fine
block now comprising the “Fairy-
mount” Estate. This he submitted
to a vigorous cause of development,
growing principally maize and rice
for the following fifteen years, when
the erection of the Mossman Central
Mill being inaugurated, cane was
cultivated on a large scale. The
opening of the mill heralded a new
and prosperous era in the fortunes
of the pioneer, as in the history of
the district, and such fine old settlers
as the late R. 0. Jones, Mr. Wil-
son, and others also saw then a
promise of fruition destined to be a
fulfilment worthy of their years of
strenuous toil. The late John Pringle
experienced many ups and downs
during his long and useful career of
MR. T. L. PRINGLE, D.C.M.
citizenship in the Far North, and
in the face of obstacles that must
often have seemed insurmountable,
made good in a manner which stands
as an example for posterity. He was
MR. H. T. PRINGLE.
one of the original directors of the
mill, and when the Shire Council
was in its infancy became a member
of that body, rendering valued ser-
vice on its Board for a number of


years. His wife was Bridget McGil-
licuddy, a member of a family that
for generations had been identified
with agricultural life in Ireland.
This lady proved herself the possessor
of those fine attributes which have
earned for our pioneer mothers the
veneration of posterity. A good wife,
mother, neighbour, and friend, her
charity found ample scope in the
early days of settlement. She
pre-deceased her husband, who died
in the year 1901, survived by a
family of five sons and one daughter.
The death of her first-born occurred
in 1916. JAMES MOSSMAN
PRINGLE, the eldest surviving son
of the couple, was born on May 18,
1883, and educated locally, his birth-
place, as that of his three younger
brothers, being “Fairymount.” To
him belongs the distinction of being
the first white child born in the
Mossman district. Following worthily
in his father’s footsteps, he devotes
himself whole-heartedly to the ad-
ministration of “Fairymount” and
to different phases of primary pro-
duction there represented. JOHN
PRINGLE, his brother next in age,
who ably assists in the working and
direction of affairs on the property,
was born on April 24, 1885. The
two younger sons of the pioneer,
HARRY TYSON PRINGLE and
THOMAS LYNCH PRINGLE, who
were born at the old home on Novem-
ber 1, 1889, and March 11, 1891,
respectively, attended a school at
Rockhampton. Both served their
country during the Great War, hav-
ing enlisted shortly after the outbreak
of hostilities, the former in January,
1915, and the latter during the pre-
vious year. Mr. Harry T. Pringle,
the elder of the two, served in Egypt
as a member of the Light Horse,
and in France with the Army Ser-
vice Corps. He remained abroad
with the troops for some time after
the Armistice was signed, finally
receiving his discharge in Australia
and returning to the old farm. Mr.
Thomas L. Pringle, on concluding
his school days, became engaged in
commerce, and was so occupied when
duty demanded his presence in the
firing line. He also saw the struggle
right through, being mentioned in
despatches and receiving the D.C.M.
for gallantry in action. For the
whole period of the war he served
with the Anzac Mounted Division,
obtaining the rank of first class
warrant officer ere the Armistice
was declared. Ida Mary Pringle, the
only daughter of the pioneer, resides
at “Fairymount” with her brother.

about six pioneers who may be said
to have founded Port Douglas, whose
example of enterprise was gradually

followed by other settlers, and who
in time saw as the fruition of their
initiative the rapid growth of a pro-
sperous agricultural district. Messrs.
John Pringle, Thomas Wilson, Dan
Hart, R. O. Jones, and Callaghan
Walsh, all now well-known names to
the residents of the Far North, were
his companions in hardship and self-
sacrifice in those early days spent in
the heart of a district infested with
aborigines of the most truculent
descrijhion and teeming with germs
of malaria and other pestilences pecu-
liar to newly opened up territory.
The perpetuation of the histories of
such men has been our object in com-
piling these memoirs, and though the
narration of their achievements is
but a small tribute to the courage,
fortitude, and resource which made
them possible, we offer it with the
knowledge that the debt of gratitude
which Queensland owes her pioneers
can at this date be in no better way
repaid. The late J. D. Johnston,
who hailed from County Derry, Ire-
land, and came of a family which
had been for centuries settled in that
country, is a brother of Mr. Samuel
Johnston, of Bundaberg. He was
still in his teens when he arrived in
Queensland, and records prove him
to have been one of the founders
of the timber industry in Rock-
hampton and Cooktown, where he is
well remembered among the few old-
timers still resident in these towns.
Prom Cooktown he made his advent
to Port Douglas about thirty-six
years ago, and taking up land in its
vicinity devoted his energies to fruit-
farming, and subsequently to cane-
growing, thenceforward following

the sugar industry for over a quarter
of a century. For many years he
lived at “Mango Park,” his home in
Mossman. As the district grew, he
proved himself one of the most
public spirited of its citizens, and
figured prominently in connection
with the movement for the establish-
ment by the Government of the
Mossman Central Sugar Mill. He
was among those who grew the first

cane for this mill, and had the dis-
tinction of opening it, being for many
years chairman of the directorate
which was formed for its control.
After local government was insti-
tuted in the district he became a
councillor of the Douglas Shire, and
by his work on that body and in
other directions won recognition
from the majority of the community
as a man who gave of his best in
their service. ■ In the year 1898 his

marriage occurred to Wilhelmina,
daughter of Mr. John Carstens, of
Maryborough, a well-known resident
of that town in the early days and
the proprietor of a large furniture
warehouse. Mr. Carstens has resided
in Maryborough for nearly forty
years. His brother, the late Fred-
erick Carstens, was amongst the
early settlers of the Port Douglas dis-
trict, and was active in forwarding
its interests as a member of the
councils and other notable bodies
which made their headquarters at
the Port. Mr. F. Carstens was well
known in the sporting world of
Queensland for his interest in the
turf and was a leader in the promo-
tion of racing events in Port Douglas,

survived by a son and two daughters.


RAYMOND DAVID REX, J.P.,
“Richmond,” Moesman, Northern
Queensland, was born at Hobart,
Tasmania, on December 21, 1873.
He is the fourth son of the late
THE LATE GEORGE REX.
George Woodcock Rex and a grand-
son of George Rex, the founder of
his line under the Southern Cross.
Mr. George Rex was a member of an
old English family whose history
MR. G. W. REX.
during several past generations was
associated chiefly with Yorkshire,
though Cambridgeshire records show
its direct descent from one John
Rex, of Stanton, who held land at
YY
the Cambridgeshire village of Stan-
ton in 1273. Representatives of the
line have figured prominently dur-
ing the different eras of history in
the work of British colonization in
various parts of the world, among
the number who have thus dis-
tinguished themselves being George
Rex, who was a notable adminis-
trator of the Honourable East India
Company. The George Rex to whom
the well-known Tasmanian family
owes its descent, was born in 1788
at Ryton, Yorkshire, and from that
County hailed to Hobart in the
thirties. Establishing himself in
commerce in partnership with the
late William Dodds, whose son, the
late Hon. Sir John Stokell Dodds,
Iv.C.M.G., was for many years Chief
Justice of Tasmania, he became one
of the representative business men
there and a notability of his day,

playing an important part in con-
nection with the progress of the
island. He married Miss Sarah
Richmond, who was a member of an
old Northumberland family which
had its headquarters at Newcastle-
on-Tyne, and at his death was sur-
vived by three sons. Of these, one
was Mr. George Woodcock Rex, the
father of the line which was estab-
lished in Northern Queensland in the
nineties. Born in Hobart and edu-
cated there at a well-known academy,
Hutchins School, he took up jour-
nalism as a profession, and was for
over half a century a member of the
staff of the Hobart Mercury, and for
a period manager of that publica-
tion. Mr. G. W. Rex married
Selina, daughter of the late William
Gracie, an erstwhile well-known
Hobart brewer, and has a family of
six sons and three daughters. Of
his sons, Mr. Raymond D. Rex, of
“Richmond,” is the fourth. At the
Hutchins School, the Alma Mater
of his father, he received a sound
scholastic education, and, though

fitted for any form of commercial
occupation, preferred to carve out
his, destiny on the land. He was
not slow to realize the opportunities
which the great Northern State
MR. W. GRACIE.
offered to those wishing to follow
any form of primary production,
and, the sugar industry suggesting
the most suitable basis for his enter-
prise, he proceeded in the year 1894


as far north as Innisfail (then
Geraldton), on the Johnstone, a
river whose watershed nourishes a
fine cane-growing centre. From the
town he immediately proceeded to
“Goondi” plantation, where, under
the supervision of Mr. C. E. Jod-
rell, a well-known planter of the
“AVONLEIGH HOUSE,” HOBART, TASMANIA.
district, he secured his early experi-
ence of up-to-date methods of culture
then practised. He remained at
“Goondi” for nearly two years,
relinquishing his post after Govern-
mental sanction had been given for
the erection of the Mossman Central
Mill, and shortly taking his place
amongst the new settlers who had
an adjoining selection, was in good
working order, he actively identified,
himself with the various movements
formed for the advancement of the
locality, and, with other prominent
residents who have worked to the
same end, now shares the satisfac-
tion of knowing that this, the most
remote sugar district in Australia so
far as the world’s markets are con-
cerned, has successfully contended
with the many difficulties that such
a circumstance necessarily involves,
and now produces and manufactures
sugar to the value of a quarter of a
million sterling. Foreseeing the im-
petus which the district would receive
he continues a strong advocate for
the speedy inauguration of this
important work, it being his opinion,
as of others equally qualified to
judge, that the Mossman agricul-
tural centre urgently needs this
right of way to permit of the
full development of its fine resources.
Among the bodies in association
with which he has for several years
concerned himself for the welfare of
the district is the Douglas Shire
Council. Another is the local com-
mittee of the repatriation movement,
of which he is honorary secretary
and Minister’s representative of the
Metropolitan Department. During
the years occupied by the Great
War he was a member of the War
Council and was most active in the
promotion of various patriotic insti-
tutions, and particularly prominent
in connection with conscription and
recruiting efforts. Among other
duties which he finds time to carry
out are those of honorary observer
for the Commonwealth Meteorologic
Bureau. He is an energetic member
of the Masonic fraternity and is the
founder of the Mossman Lodge 3495,
E.C., of which he is a Past Master,
being a holder also of Past Grand
rank in the District Grand Lodge of
England. For several years past he
has exercised the Commission of
the Peace when called upon. In the
year 1904 he married Gwendoline,
daughter of the late R. O. Jones,
purchased land from the pioneers of
the Mossman as soon as a suitable
market was provided for their in-
dustry, set himself determinedly to
the task of development and pro-
duction. When his property, which

The late RICHARD OWEN
JONES. In the memoirs of the
lives of our pioneers we have
endeavoured to convey to the reader
some idea of the trials, hardships,

and obstacles which were combated
and overcome by the men who were
in the van of settlement in different
portions of this great State, though
with the full realization that such

descriptions necessarily fall short of
the grim realities with which the
first settlers were faced. One of the
most notable of those who may well
be termed the nation builders of that
yy2
part of the Far North lying between
Cooktown and Cairns was the gentle-
man whose name figures at the head
of this article. He was born on
April 17, 1852, at the vicarage of
Llandyfriog, near Newcastle Emlyn,
Cardiganshire, Wales, his father
having been rector of Llandyfriog.
The family to which he owed his
descent has been represented in the
ministry of the Church of England
throughout several generations of its
history, and his two brothers, the
late Rev. Isaac Jones (who pre-
deceased him) and the Rev. Thomas
Walter Rankes-Jones, of the living
of Holdenby (presented by the King
by letters-patent under the Great
Seal), also spent their lives in its
service. On the distaff side of the
house, he may claim descent from a
prominent Anglican Churchman, his
maternal grandfather, a gentleman
of independent means, having been
rector of the parish adjoining
Llandyfriog, and the owner of Ern
Castle, at which he resided. Mr.
R. O. Jones arrived in Queensland
about the early seventies, and there-
after, having qualified as a chemist
in Cardigan, Wales, devoted a short
time to his profession in Brisbane.
The possibilities of mining caused
him to relinquish his business con-
nection and follow the lure of the
metal fields for a period, the end of
which witnessed Iris arrival at the
Mossman, whose district was destined
to be the scene of his future exer-
tions and of a long and useful career.
Here he took up a large tract of
country on which, at one time, he
had as tenants 200 Chinese who grew
rice, maize, and other cereals. He
erected a mill for the treatment of
rice thus grown, and interesting
himself also in the timber industry,
erected a sawmill on the estate. He
became one of the earliest sugar
growers on the Mossman, and at
“The Cedars,” his large property
devoted to cane culture, grew most
of the raw product required of the
district as a guarantee for the erec-
tion of the Mossman Central Mill,
a factory which his efforts were
largely instrumental in securing,
both by the promotion of a body to
wait on the Government to that end
and as secretary and a member of
the deputation. As president of
many of the old associations formed
for its advancement, he further
played a vigorous part in connec-
tion with the district’s development,
and the erection of the Church
of England, of which he was a
practical member, was due to his and
Mr. R. D. Rex’s efforts. He was
created a Justice of the Peace in the
late seventies, and for some time pre-
ceding his death, which occurred on

of his residence in the locality—in
the seventies and eighties—he had
much to contend with from the
blacks, who were so great a menace
to the white settlers that it was


considered suicidal to penetrate the
jungle then fringing the settlement
without being fully armed. This fine
old pioneer' married in the year
1882 Mary Letitia Richards, who,
MR. W. P. JONES.
like her husband, was a native of
Wales. Mrs. Jones shared with the
latter the difficult task of founding a
home in a district to which in the
early years of her married life the
conveyance of the bare necessaries of
existence ofttimes constituted a
distress or sickness, she has given
generously of her aid to the local
hospital, and for several years past
she has been president of the Red
Cross movement. She, with her
three sons and two daughters, sur-
vived the pioneer. Of her daughters,
one is now Mrs. R. D. Rex, and
the other is the wife of Mr. Samuel
Johnston, jun. Her eldest son,
WILLIAM PARRY JONES, was
born at Port Douglas on November
12, 1889, and educated with his two
brothers at Mossman. On leaving
school he secured in the office of the
Mossman Mill a post which he re-
tained for the following five years,
relinquishing it in 1911 to accept a
position as book-keeper and account-
ant at the Mossman branch of the
well-known business of Jack and
Newell, Ltd. Less than two years
later, his keenness and ability
resulted in his appointment as man-
ager of the branch, a capacity in
which he has since acted. He is
interested in sugar production at
“The Cedars,” the property founded
by his late father. In all movements
counting for the advancement of the
district or the betterment of the
community he takes his share, and
he actively interests himself in
Masonic affairs, taking a prominent
place among members of the craft
as a Past Master of the Mossman
Lodge, E.C. In the year 1917 he
married Maggie Agnes, daughter of

he is now engaged in the adminis-
tration of his property. He married
in the year 1915 Maud, daughter of
the late Henry Georg© Westbury,


who in the early days played his
part in the industrial development
of Northern Queensland as a fol-
lower of mining. Of the union there
are two daughters. HERBERT
OWEN JONES was born on
December 29, 1893, and from school
duties entered the sugar industry at
“The Cedars.” Here he continued
to assist his father until the death
of the latter, when he entered upon
the management of the area. When
the need for man power was being
most severely felt by the Empire, he
offered himself for service with the
A.1.F., and his application finding
acceptance, the closure of the year
1916 saw him well inured to the
hardships of the strenuous life on
the Egyptian Front. During the
latter part of his career in the army,
which was spread over nearly three
years, he was engaged as a mechanic
of the Flying Corps, in which he was
also, for a period, an official photo-
grapher. When peace was declared
he returned to the old farm and
resumed the reins of management
which he had laid down when duty
demanded his presence at the war
front. His brother, Edward Hughes
Jones, was also a volunteer for ser-
vice with the A.1.F., but, failing to
pass the strict medical test pre-
scribed by the military authorities,
had perforce to content himself with
doing “his bit” in assisting such
movements as were instituted for the
soldiers’ welfare at home and by
continuing to play his part in the
industrial life of the State. Mr. H.
Owen Jones married in the year
1922 Georgina, daughter of Mr. R.
S. Reid, a Townsville pioneer, who
for many years has been prominent
in the public life of that city, and
has held aldermanic honours for a
considerable time.
MUNTZ BROS., “River Ter-
race,” Mossman. The Muntz family,
of which the three proprietors of
“River Terrace” are members, was
founded under the Southern Cross
MR. W. H. MUNTZ.
by the late Hugh Muntz, whose
progenitors settled in County Down,
Ireland, late in the seventeenth
century, having come to the country
as members of a settlement estab-
lished in the reign of William of
Orange soon after the accession of
that monarch to the throne of Eng-
land. Mr. Hugh Muntz was
attracted to Australia by stories of
the wonderful yields of the first gold-
fields here discovered, and landed in
Melbourne in the early fifties. Pro-
ceeding inland, he continued for
many years to be a notable figure at
one or another of the early diggings,
pioneering commerce in its initial
stages in intervals of active partici-
pation in the mining industry, and
finally becoming the owner of a busi-
ness in Woodend, a town lying
49 miles from the Victorian capital.
He acquired land in the vicinity of
Woodend, and here his business so
prospered that in time he found him-
self in the position to embark upon
a commercial venture in the metro-
polis. Through the failure of large
speculations in which he invested at
about this time his enterprise was
hampered to a certain extent, but he
carried on pluckily in Melbourne
until he had the satisfaction of seeing
the family fortunes partially restored
by successful speculations in grain.
Mr. Hugh Muntz died in 1889,
and for some years his sons con-
tinued to carry on business in the
South. Eventually, realizing that
the financial crisis which commenced
in Melbourne in 1892 was likely to
preclude for some time the possibility
of any great degree of success
in commerce, the three brothers now
comprising the Northern Queensland
firm of Muntz Bros., accompanied by
their mother and one sister, sought
new fields for their enterprise. The
year 1896 witnessed their advent to
Mossman in the Far North, where
they purchased a large cane farm,
and, devoting themselves whole-
heartedly to the task of forwarding
the prospects of the industry in the
locality, came to be recognized ere
long as among the most progressive
planters and leading citizens of this
part of the State. The Messrs.
Muntz, of “River Terrace,” were all

born in Woodend and educated in
Melbourne. Their experience in the
commercial world of the great Vic-
torian city has stood them in good
stead in their agricultural venture

and in various movements with which
they have been associated in the
interests of the public. WILLIAM
HENRY MUNTZ, the eldest mem-
ber of the firm, has devoted himself
almost exclusively to the industry
which represents its main interests,
and being of a studious disposition
and a deep reader and thinker, is
well versed in historical, biograph-
ical, and scientific literature. His
brother, GEORGE WOODYILLE
MUNTZ, J.P., has prominently
participated in public life, and his
co-operation is counted an important
factor towards the successful issue
of any movement set afoot for the
advantage of the district or com-
munity. He was gazetted a Justice
of the Peace by the Philp Adminis-
tration. For fourteen years he occu-
pied the presidentship of the local
hospital, and for some years past
ho has been chairman of the Moss-
man Central Mill. ALFRED
THOMAS MUNTZ, the youngest
of the trio, has also shared in the
public duties of citizenship, devoting
himself more particularly to works
o’ charity and social reform. With
his brothers he has taken an equally
active part in association with
patriotic bodies, and all forms of
clean sport—especially cricket, in
which he excels—have for him a
strong appeal. He is at home both
in the pulpit and on the platform,
and an indefatigable worker for the
Church of which he is a member.
The Messrs. Muntz are prominent in
Masonic circles of the district. They
are all home lovers, and their
mutuality of interests stands not only
for business affairs but for those
homely influences which tend to the

unity of family life. A brother not
previously mentioned is Mr. John E.
Muntz, of Pimpama, a well-known
civil engineer of Southern Queens-
land.

COTTON GROWING AT DAWSON VALLEY.


The late Hon. SIR ROBERT
PHILP, K.C.M.G., by whose
demise the State lost a man of the
highest personal character and one
who w T as identified with the devel-
opment of Queensland during its
most progressive period, was born at
Glasgow, on December 28, 1851, the
son of John Philp, a native of Bal-
gownie, Fifeshire. Though a native
of Glasgow he cam© of a family
which had been settled in Fifeshire
for many centuries. Records show
that in 1138 a Philp held the office
of Chamberlain to
King David of
Scotland, whilst the
Exchequer rolls
of Scotland prove
that one Robert
Philp was a. free-
holder at Balgonie
(Balgownie) in
1492, and a James
Philp held the
office of clerk to the
Privy Council of
Scotland. Later
Bailie Robert. Philp,
of Kirkcaldy, don-
ated £71,000 early
in the nineteenth
century, to form the
Philp Trust for the
purpose of erecting
schools in the col-
liery centres of his
country. In 1862
John Philp left
Glasgow by the sail-
ing ship “Helen-
slee,” of 800 tons
burden, with his
family for the in-
fant Colony of
Queensland, arriv-
ing at Moreton Bay
after a wearisome
voyage of 105
iltiyvS. Hebert was then a boy of
but ten years of age, and upon
the Scholars Roll of the old
National School, Brisbane, for
August, 1862, may still be seen
the name of Robert Philp. After
two yeais at the National School he
entered the employ of Messrs. Bright
Bros., now the prosperous firm of
Gibbs, Bright & Co., whom he served
for the following eleven years where-
in he gained much valuable commer-
cial and shipping experience. Al-
though he started out to earn his liv-
ing at such a tender age it was not to
be supposed that a lad of his tempera-
ment would be content with the edu-
cation he had gained, and so we find
him being assisted in his studies by
one who was destined to make his
name in Australian literature, Brun-
ton Stephens, one of our sweetest
poets. From this lovable personal-
ity he learned French and Latin. At
the invitation of Mr. James Bums
he proceeded to Townsville, in 1874,
and thus was started the great mer-
cantile and shipping firm of Burns,
Philp & Co. Ltd., whose operations

now extend throughout the Common-
wealth and Islands of the Pacific. His
efforts aided greatly in the develop-
ment of the back country of North-
ern Queensland, and he was instru-
mental in arranging for teams to link
up with Winton, Kynuna and Bou-
lia. In fact, much of the pioneering
of the North, the progress of the

tries, the opening up of the Northern
Queensland and Island ports, is due
to his interest and association. In
1886 he first entered politics as mem-
ber for Musgrave, and later, in
1888, contesting the Townsville elec-
torate was returned with John Mac-
rossan and thenceforward repre-
sented the district continuously for
27 years. From 1893 to 1896 he was
Minister for Public Works; 1894 to
1895, Minister for Public Instruc-
tion; 1895 to 1897, Minister for
Railways; 1893 to 1903, Minister for
Mines, and he was Treasurer in the
Governments headed by Sir Hugh
Nelson, the Hon. T. J. Byrnes, and
Sir James Dickson. In December,
1899, he became Premier and also
fulfilled the duties
of Treasurer and
Minister for Mines,
later exchanging
the portfolio of
Treasurer for that
of Chief Secretary.
The Morgan Coali-
tion came into
power in the later
part of 1903, and
from that time on-
ward until 1908
Sir Robert Philp
was leader of the
Opposition. In
November, 190 8,
he again formed
a Ministry which
was short-lived, for
at the general elec-
tion of February,
1909, Mr. Kidston
was returned. In
October, 1909,
came the Kidston-
Philp Coalition,
when Sir Robert
voluntarily surren-
dered his position
and stepped down
into the ranks as a
private m ember
solely because he
thought that was
the best thing to
do in the public interests. August,
1912, marked the jubilee of his ar-
rival in Queensland, and wishing to
again see the land of his birth he
decided to take a holiday and revisit
old scenes. As there was a general
election approaching he suggested to
his constituents that he might be
allowed to close his period of contin-
ued service, but they would not hear
of this and he was nominated and
returned at the head of the poll
without having addressed a meeting.
The Nineteenth Parliament duly
expired by effluxion of time and a


general election was held in May,
1915, when the Government suffered
defeat at the hands of Labour, and
Sir Robert thus ended his exceptional
career as a member of Parliament,
and as a Minister of the Crown,
wherein he had gained the right to
be termed the “father of the
House.’’ Although he perforce re-
tired from active participation in
Parliamentary life yet his interest
was still keen and with his big-
hearted generosity he was ever ready
to give friends the benefit of the
knowledge gained during his long
experience. In 1914 the honour of

James Campbell, founder of the
firm of James Campbell & Sons,
Limited, and then to Miss Munro,
twin sister of Miss Munro, of Clay-
field, and a cousin of Mrs. James
Forsyth and other members of the
Campbell and Petrie families. Of
the first union were born two sons,
Colin J. C. Philp, of “Wyaralong”
Station, Beaudesert, whose biog-
raphy appears in Volume I. of this
work, and Robert Charles Philp, of
Brisbane, and five daughters, Miss

Philp, and Miss Ivy Philp.
years, at the end of which he was
given the first of those opportunities
which he has invariably seized as
stepping stones to greater things.
This was the offer of a post in Foots-
cray, Victoria, in the drapery estab-
lishment of J. H. Hooper & Sons.
Queensland first knew him in 1901,
when he left Victoria for Brisbane
and entered the employ of Mr. W. J.
Overell as manager of the fancy
drapery sections of the business of
Overells, Limited. Two years later
he was engaged to take charge of
similar departments in the pre-
mises of McWhirter & Sons (now
McWhirters, Limited), and after 4,(

and St. George was conferred upon
him by His Majesty King George V.,
and he was truly worthy of the dis-
tinguished honour for as a man he
was as loved as he was trusted. The
early strenuous life of the North had
been taking its toll for some time
prior to 1922, when Sir Robert went
for a quiet holiday to the Blue
Mountains, New South Wales, but
unfortunately his health did not
benefit, and on June 17, of that
year, he passed away at a private
hospital in Brisbane, leaving a name
that is written in letters of gold on
the scroll of fame of our fair State.
He married twice, the first time to
ALBERT CHARLES BYER-
LEY, founder of the important Val-
ley business known as the A.C.8.,
and the organizing head whose sound
business principles have brought this
house, in the comparatively short
space of time since its establishment,
into line with the most imjiortant
drapery businesses in the State, was
born in Victoria and spent his early
life on a small farm situated within a
few miles of Melbourne. As exem-
plifying the possibility of success in
the face of disadvantages which cur-
tailed study is usually considered to
entail, it is mentioned that he left
school at the age of eleven. Farm
labour occupied him for about two
years’ service with this firm he
started out on his own account in a
wholesale business. Though ani-
mated by ambition, enterprise and
exceptional organizing powers, he
was not altogether successful in his
initial venture, bad health and the
lack of self-confidence proving mili-
tant factors in respect to the contin-
uance of the undertaking. Realiz-
ingj too, that still further experi-
ence would help him in the invest-
ment of capital, he wound up his
business and joined the permanent
staff, as their Queensland representa-
tive of O. E. Burbank & Co., Mel-
bourne and the States Manufacturing
Co., Melbourne. The opportunities


given him by this post, which he
retained for five years, visiting twice
a year all the principal centres of
Queensland, strengthened his confi-
dence in his own capabilities and in
every way fitted him for the impor-
tant position next offered him and
involving the full control of Harris
and Company’s business in Rock-
hampton. This business he contin-
ued to manage on a profit-sharing
agreement for three years, and at the
end of that period felt that the time
was ripe for the launching of the
A.C.8., the big undertaking which,
for some time previously, he bad had
in view. Returning to Brisbane in
and the idea of personal importance.
Thoroughly convinced that the status
of a person or firm is chiefly attained
as the outcome of public opinion, his
first and foremost consideration was
to secure the confidence of the
people, whom experience had taught
him are the keenest and soundest
judges of the worth of a business.
This and other considerations of Mr.
Byerley’s may be summed up in the
following principles:—To give service
to the people as distributors, to study
and use sound economic principles,
to recognize that human beings are
separate individuals and that it is
a firm’s duty to study and care for
for a ten-storied building to be
constructed of re-inforced concrete
on land adjoining the present free-
hold premises in which the vast busi-
ness of the A.C.B. is being con-
ducted. When this building is com-
pleted the organization will have a
freehold frontage of 360 feet.
Within a few months the list of
towns with permanent stores con-
trolled by the A.C.B. will read
as follows:—Brisbane, Warwick,
Roma, Toowoomba, Ipswich, Gym-
pie, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rock-
hampton, Mackay, Townsville, and
Cairns. Thus will be still further in-
creased the firm’s collective buying
THE 360 FEET FRONTAGE OF THE A.C.B. ESTABLISHMENT, THE VALLEY, BRISBANE.
October of the year 1916, he chose
the site now occupied by this progres-
sive organization, starting operations
on Friday, the thirteenth day of the
month —a fact that will doubtless
strike the attention of those who are
in the habit of associating this day
and date with ill luck. From the out-
set his faith in the State and his own
powers dominated his operations, and
the thought of failure was given no
place among the big schemes which
occupied his mind. He measured
ability with his keenest competitors,
disregarded the power of L.S.D., and
realized the vast difference between
the thinking and doing of big things
the interests of those they employ
and to command that loyal and
stanch service that, as a harmonious
effort welded by the good-will of the
employer and employe and emanat-
ing from the example of the former,
is essential to the success of any or-
ganization. Mr. Byerley started
the A.C.B. in Fortitude Valley with
a stock value of £5,000 and a total
staff of 17. To-day, after a period
spread over not quite seven years, the
firm employs constantly over 600
people, has permanent stores in seven
centres carrying stock to the value
of a. quarter of a million sterling,
and is now laying the foundations
and distributing power, which per-
mits trade on the keenest basis and
enables each centre, as dealing with
part of a huge organization, which
strives to place necessities before the
people at the lowest possible cost, to
secure advantages that the largest
concern can offer and which sets out
for all its branches the maxim—the
A.C.B. relying on the public patron-
age, is the servant of the public
at all times. The A.C.B. trades only
for cash, credit and time-payment
systems increasing overhead costs and
thus disturbing the keen basis of
trade winch is one of its chief objec-
tives, being absolutely eliminated.


The Hon. THOMAS CHARLES
BEIRNE, M.L.C., “Glengariff,”
Derby Street, Hendra, managing
director of the widely-known and
successful business of T. C. Beirne
and Co., Ltd., was born on Sep-
tember 9, 1860, at Ballymacurley,
Roscommon, Ireland, and is a son
of John and Catherine Beirne, of
the same County. Educated at the
Franciscan Monastery School at
Faraher, he completed his collegiate
course at the age of fourteen, and his
subsequent career affords a striking
proof of the results to be attained
by integrity, industry, and per-
severance when such qualities are
combined with business acumen of
the sort that has marked all Mr.
Beirne’s undertakings. His first in-
sight into the drapery business was
gained, shortly after he left school,
in the establishment of Dominick
Owens, of Strokestown, Ireland.
Here he spent the period intervening
between 1874 and 1881, in the latter
year joining the staff of Gallagher
Bros., and later that of M. D. Pig-
gott, West Ireland. Early in 1884,
realizing that big opportunities must
offer in a young country like Aus-
tralia, he sailed for Victoria,
arriving in Melbourne in February
of the same year, and, immediately
after, entering the service of Eyre
and Shepherd, owners of large
drapery businesses in Lygon and
Gratton Streets, Carlton. He was
with this firm for a year, towards the
end of which he was appointed
financial manager of their Richmond
branch, holding the position until
spent in the employ of Messrs. Allan
and Stark, he opened, in conjunction
with Mr. M. D. Piggott, a drapery
establishment in Stanley Street,
South Brisbane. Four years later,
HON. T. C. BEIRNE.
on January 13, 1889, the premises
and stock of Messrs. Beirne and
Piggott were, together with five
other shops, completely destroyed by
fire. In March the business was re-
established, the partners carrying on
jointly until August 19, 1891, when,
the term of the firm’s agreement
having expired, Mr. Beirne sold his
interest to Mr. Piggott and opened
a small drapery establishment in
Beirne revisited the Old World, and
further expansion in Queensland
effected in 1893 and 1902, when the
Ipswich and Mackay branches were
respectively opened. The subject of
our memoir, who is also governing
director of Beirne Limited, Mackay
and Ipswich, is widely travelled. In
1905 he completed a six months’ tour
in Japan, and two years later again
visited Great Britain, subsequently
touring the Continent, Egypt, and
South Africa. He has also visited
at different times New Zealand,
Tasmania, and the various Aus-
tralian States, and recently re-
visited Japan. He is prominent in
both political and business circles,
having been a member of the Legis-
lative Council from July 26, 1905,
until the abolition of the Upper
House, and for some years past a
director of the A.M.P. Society, the
Brisbane Tramways Company, the
Brisbane Gas Company, the Queens-
land Trustees, the Atlas Assurance
Company, and just recently has
been elected a director of the British
Australian Cotton Association, Ltd.
Mr. Beirne married, on April 11,
1887, Annie, youngest daughter of
Bernard Kavanagh, Dublin, Ireland.
Of the union there are five daugh-
ters, four of whom are married. Of
these the eldest, Emily, married Mr.
Thomas Brackenridge Hooper, of
T. B. Hooper & Co., merchants,
Brisbane. The second, Catherine
Cecilia, is married to Mr. Henry
Douglas, merchant, of Elliot, Don-
aldson & Douglas, Ltd., Brisbane,
and son of the late Hon. John
offered employment with Messrs.
Foy & Gibson, of Collingwood, Mel-
bourne. In November, 1885, sensing
the possibilities of business invest-
ment in Queensland, he resigned his
post in Collingwood and proceeded
to Brisbane, where, after two months

THOMAS HEASLOP & CO.,
LIMITED, a firm name long familiar
to Brisbane residents and evolved
from the re-arrangement of the pion-
eer firm of J. and T. Heaslop which
MR. T. HEASLOP
established the present well-known
South Brisbane business in the year
1865. Thomas Heaslop was born in
MR. A. SHARPE.
Cavan, North of Ireland, and came
to Australia with his parents when
quite young. When the partnership
of J. and T. Heaslop was dissolved
ae formed the firm of Thomas Heae-
lop & Co., Limited, and remained
its head until his demise in 1911.
He was a shrewd business man and
gifted with exceptional ability for
obtaining the maximum results from
Iris employes. He was stern but
just and his word was his bond. The
present head of this old-established
business is FREDERICK ROBERT
SHARPE, whose career in Austra-
lia, his adopted country, affords a
remarkable example of unwavering
perseverance and singleness of pur-
pose and the results bound to follow
when such qualities are combined
with the ability, personality, and
powers of organization with which
this gentleman is gifted. A son of
Alfred and Harriet Sharpe, of Aven-
ing, near Stroud, Gloucestershire,
England, he was born in Avening
on May 13, 1870, and there educated
as a National School student, com-
pleting his studies as a scholarship
holder. His first essay in the direc-
tion of earning his livelihood was as
a member of the teaching profession,
which afforded him employment in
his native village for two years.
Though of ancestry that dwelt in or
around Gloucestershire for 400 years,
he can claim descent from two old
Scottish families, records showing
that during the reign of King Robert
Bruce, progenitors of both sides of
his house came to England and there
settled, handing down names which
for centuries were associated with
industrial life in the Valley of the
Avon in Gloucestershire. His father
was engaged in the manufacture of
cloth, and other of his forbears
have been well-known contractors
and stone workers in the Avon
Valley. On the distaff side of the
house he is immediately descended
from the Locks, a representative
farming family which for generations
had contributed energy and capital
to the work of primary production in
England. Equipped, with the herit-
age, mental, physical and moral,
which such an ancestry was likely to
bestow, he left England for Austra-
lia before reaching the age of seven-
teen, being prompted to try his
fortune in a younger land by the
perusal of current literature strongly
representing the potentialities and
possibilities of the far-distant Island
Continent. Queensland, he realized,
offered, as the youngest of the then
Colonies, the most promising outlook
for a young man anxious to make
hie way in life, and, accordingly, he

enough to dissi-
pate the hope
and determina-
tion which had
guided him thus
far in his des-
tiny. Though
trained as a
teacher he was to
find in commerce,
in the great
State of which
he is now go pro-
minent a citizen,
his true vocation.
He secured work
immediately after
his arrival in the
drapery shop of
Chas. Jones &
C 0,., on the
corner of Edward
and Queen
Streets, Bri s -
bane, where he
remained for six
weeks, then he
went with Davis,
Laird, & Co.,
hardware and
crockery mer-
chants, for three
weeks, and next took a position in
the stationery business with Gordon
& Gotch, of Queen Street, with whom
he remained for about four months
until August, 1887, when he started
upon his upward career from the
lowest rung of the commercial ladder
as office boy in the hardware depart-
ment of Messrs. J. and T. Heaslop’s
warehouse, where, to judge by subse-
quent results, his time was profitably
spent, for within a year he was pro-
moted to the responsible appointment
of manager of the hardware depart-
ment of a branch shop of the same
firm. That was in 1888. Continu-
ing true to his resolution to relax no
effort that might bring him nearer to
the goal of success, he steadily
advanced in the firm’s good opinion
until, at the end of seven years, be
was placed in full charge of the hard-
ware and crockery department of the
head warehouse. His value by this
time had been demonstrated in many
directions and during the period
elapsing between 1895 and 1901
became fully appreciated through
the general progress made in his
department. In the year 1901, fol-
lowing the retirement of Mr. James
Heaslop from the original firm, he

was appointed general warehouse
manager, in which position his
powers had the needed scope, his
energy, foresight and keen business
insight—already factors that had
added largely to the success and
prestige of the important business of

which he is now
the head—crea-
ting larger op-
portunities and
resultant opera-
tions that neces-
sitated, for the
less complicated
working of its
many ramifica-
tions, the con-
version of the
firm into a lim-
ited company.
On the culmina-
tion of this event
he was made a
director of
Thomas Heaslop
& Co., Limited
—the new title
of the business-
in which capacity
the keenness that
had hitherto
tended to bind
his interests so
closely with those
of the firm which
he represented,
prompted him to,
if possible closer
application. In 1911, after the death
of Mr. Thomas Heaslop, it is not
surprising to find him the purchaser


of the late gentleman’s shares, and
two years later, secured the remain-
ing outstanding shares of the other
director of the company. After
purchasing the interests held by the
late Thomas Heaslop, Mr. Sharpe

ducted under the name of The

assumed the managing directorship
of Thomas Heaslop & Co., Limited,
and among the interests he con-
trolled in this capacity was a large
wholesale grocery, crockery and
hardware business in Roma Street,
Toowoomba, Warwick, and four in
Brisbane. The wholesale business be
decided to relinquish in the year
1922, when the general business of
the company became so large as to
demand a re-arrangement of the
extensive organization which he con-
trols he finds leisure to devote to out-
side matters as a member of the
Brisbane Merchants’ Association and
other bodies. For some time he was
a member of the Brisbane Chamber

of Commerce, but finding his activi-
ties in this connection were likely to
encroach on time required for the
direction of his big South Brisbane
business, he resigned from the
Association. The standing of Thomas
Heaslop & Co. in the estimation of
the public is largely due to his unre-
mitting study and thorough compre-
hension of the needs of the public
and to courtesy which he exercises,
as an example for every individual
employed in his warehouse, and
demands should be unfailingly
accorded to all with whom the firm
has dealings. He holds at time of
writing the position of chairman of
directors of The Surgical Supplies
Limited, is the chairman of The
Citizens and Graziers’ Assurance Co.,
Limited, and a director of Topikads,
Limited. Mr. Sharpe is a good shot
and gets much pleasure from motor
trips to spots where good sport is to
be obtained. He is a member of the
Brisbane Club, the Queensland Turf
Club, the Commercial Travellers’
Association and the Stock Exchange
Club, and finds recreation on the
links as a member of the Hamilton
Golf Club. In November of the year
1891, he married Matilda Elizabeth,
daughter of the Revd. Stephen Glas-
sop, and grand-daughter of the late
Revd. Stephen Glassop, a Baptist
divine, whose work in the very early
days did much to forward the inter-
ests and history of the Baptist com-
munion in Sydney. Of the union
there is a family of two sons, Frank
Victor and Alfred Roy, born in 1904
and 1906 respectively, and three
daughters who are their senior's and
whose names in order of their ages
are Edith Augusta, Winifred Vera,
and Constance Mildred. Both sons
were educated at the Brisbane Boys’
College at Clayfield, entering their
father’s employ on completion oi
their scholastic course to gain experi-
ence of the trade of which their
father is such a well-known figure.
At time of writing Mr. F. R. Sharpe
has just bought and is reconstructing
important premises in Brunswick
Street, Valley, where he intends to
install his two sons in business on
their own account, under a separate
company formed and titled Sharpes
Limited, as hardware, crockery and
fancy goods merchants with other
allied commodities. To men of the
calibre of Mr. F. R. Sharpe the
State owes much of her wonderful
commercial advancement.

Captain OSCAR SVENSEN,
Galloway’s Hill, Norman Park, was
born at Larvik, Norway, on July 1,
1862. A descendant of seafaring
stock, he adopted the calling of his
progenitors at an early age, and long
ere he was nineteen had made many
voyages and become well used to the
rigors of life afloat in the icy waters
of Northern Europe. At nineteen
he was hardy, resourceful, and cap-
able to a degree that would not have
been possible of attainment under
less strenuous conditions, and at
that age held the mastership of a-
vessel which traded between the
Baltic and North Seas. In the early
eighties, the spirit of adventure
hitherto responsible for many of his
movements proved the determining
factor in deciding a voyage to
Queensland, which he accomplished
in the brig-rigged auxiliary vessel
“John Elder.” The journey to
Svdney was accomplished without
misadventure or exciting incident to
mark her passage, and thence, after
a day spent in viewing the city, Mr.
Svensen proceeded to Brisbane. At
this time he was twenty-one years
of age. In Brisbane he met Mr.
Alexander Archer, Inspector of the
Bank of New South Wales and one
of the original members of the well-
known Rockhampton family of
arrived from England, and being
fitted out for her first Queensland
trip. During the period he was
attached to the vessel he came much
in contact with the various Ministers

of the day, and recalls among other
incidents an occasion when, the
landing at Dunwich being difficult,
he carried the late Sir Samuel
removed to Melbourne, where he
became engaged in ship chandlering.
In 1889 he revisited Norway, re-
maining in the Old World for a few
months. On his return to Australia
he embarked upon the venture in
the Solomon Islands from which such
important results have evolved,
trading in the South Seas in part-
nership with his brother and two
friends (also Norwegians), and
prospering from a business point of
view. This was before the days of
the protectorate. His early enter-
prise was established in the face of
extreme peril from the natives and
from the pestilential fevers common
to such localities, and some idea of
the severity of the latter may be
gathered when it is mentioned that
two of the party (one being Mr.
Svensen’s brother) died within the
first year of their arrival at the
Islands. Persevering in spite of such
grave discouragement, in a few years
time he acquired territory for plant-
ing, and in 1896 had a large area
under cocoanuts and Liberian coffee,
his property being the first planta-
tion formed in the Islands. Tragedy
accompanied the venture, for the
manager of the plantation, a French-
man, met his death in the course of
his duties at the hands of a fierce
hill tribe of the Solomons, Mr.

“Gracemere,” to whom he had
brought letters from Norway. Mr.
Archer secured for him a position
on the Government yacht “Lu-
cinda,” which was then newly
Griffith on his shoulders from the
vessel to the shore. He resigned from
the “Lucinda” to take a position with
the Brisbane Steam Ferry Co., which
he held until 1888, in which year he
Sven sen being absent in one of bis
schooners at the time of the murder,
which caused him to temporarily
relinquish planting. In 1898, how-
ever, he embarked on similar ventures


in two localities in the Islands.
These and later acquirements he con-
tinued to develop until 1906, when
he had an aggregate acreage of
1,000 under cultivation, his proper-
ties being devoted chiefly to pro-
ducing cocoanuts. In the meantime
his trading operations had consider-
ably expanded, and in the year
above mentioned, half the export
and import trade of the Islands was
in his hands. At this time the
Messrs. Lever Bros, had become
established as traders and planters
in the West Pacific, and Mr. Svcn-
sen sold to this firm his own large
interests, including plantations,
schooners, and other accessories of
his business, the transaction proving
the basis of immense development in
the Solomon group. Shortly after-
wards he embarked on fresh enter-
prises here, acquiring three planta-
tions, two of which were later
formed into company concerns in
Brisbane and Sydney, but he still
retained a considerable interest in
them. They are devoted to cocoanut
products only, as the rainfall in the
locality, which in places amounts to
300 inches annually, renders coffee
growing impracticable. Mr. Svensen
took up his residence permanently in
Brisbane in the year 1906, and from
here makes periodical visits to the
Islands, where he is sole owner of
one plantation and heavily interested
in two others. Three years ago he
was appointed Consul for Norway,
succeeding Mr. Carter in this office.
In the year 1900 he married Miss
Schreuder, a Norwegian lady, and
his family consists of a son, aged
nine, and seven daughters, the
youngest of whom is seven years of
age. His eldest daughter, Lily, mar-’
ried, on February 2, 1923, Mr.
Neville Whitehouse, son of Mr. B.

known Brisbane music warehouse.

Chairman of Stuparts Ltd., Mary-
borough, Queensland. Born near
Airdrie, Scotland, on December 20,
1856, he is the eldest son of Mr.
Robert Allan, farmer. He was edu-
cated in his native country, and
later, after going to business,
attended evening classes at the
Athenaeum, and the Andersonian
College, Glasgow, both of which are
zz2
now merged in larger seats of learn-
ing. In his seventeenth year he re-
ceived his first insight into the trade
which he was later to so prominently
represent in Queensland, and contin-
ued in business at home until in his
twenty-third year. Impelled doubt-
less by the pioneering spirit which
has characterized the Scotch to a
greater degree even than other
English-speaking nationalities, and
with a keen realization of the possi-
bilities of expansion in a country like
Australia, he then definitely decided
to carve a career in the young Conti-
nent, and accepted an appointment
from Messrs. D. L. Brown & Co., of
Brisbane, Queensland, where he
arrived in the year 1879. Here he

was afforded the desired scope for a
temperament essentially enterpris-
ing, and in 1882, ere he had com-
pleted three years in the land of his
adoption, he embarked, in conjunc-
tion with Mr. R. B. Stark, upon a
small beginning in the drapery trade,
and for many years the partners con-
tinued in joint control of their ever-
expanding interests under the firm
title of Allan & Stark. In 1911,
twentymine years after the founda-
tion of the firm, a private limited
company was formed, with Mr. Allan
as chairman, and at the same time a
number of employes were afforded
an opportunity of acquiring interests
in the business under the profit shar-
ing system. In 1919 the business was
converted into a public company, of
which he is chairman. He has not
permitted the exigencies of private
affairs to exclude other duties of citi-
zenship, as instanced in the fact that
he contested and won the South Bris-
bane seat in the Legislative Assembly
in 1909, and was the successful can-
didate for Kurilpa in 1912. He also
served on the South Brisbane Town
Council, with which he was asso-
ciated as Alderman from 1892-5.
Mr. Allan occupied the presidentship
of the Brisbane Drapers’ Association
for many years. He is president of
the Brisbane Young Men’s Christian
Association, vice-president of the
Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, and
is also on the Executive of the Town
Planning Association, and other
public bodies. He is also a founda-
tion member of the Brisbane Rotary
Club. In 1917 he was appointed by
the National Council of Australia,
Hon. Chief Commissioner, Treasurer
and Chairman of the London Execu-
tive of the Australian Y.M.C.A. con-
trolling Army and Navy work in
England and France, and he returned
to Brisbane after the Armistice was
signed. He received the rank of
Hon. Major, and has General Ser-
vice and Victory Medals. His tastes
tending in that direction, the inter-
vals of a busy career are devoted to
literature. On June 4, 1885, he
married Elizabeth Balloch, daughter
of the late Thomas Stark, of Falkirk,
Scotland, and he has a family of two
sons and two daughters.
The Hon. FRANK McDON-
NELL, “Glendalough,” Eagle Junc-
tion, Clayfield, co-Managing Direc-
tor of McDonnell & East, Ltd.,
Drapers and General Merchants,
George Street, Brisbane. A high
conception of the responsibilities of
the individual, combined with a
strong and active personality, a
fidelity to ideals which urged him to
strive for the uplift of humanity and
to apply his gifts as an organizer to
that end, have been the distinguish-
ing marks in the career of the gen-
tleman whose name gives the title to
this article. Born in Ennis, County
Clare, Ireland, on January 24, 1863,
of James and Eliza McDonnell of
that place, and educated in the
school of a local branch of the
Christian Brothers, he started life as
an apprentice to the drapery trade
in Galway, and here spent the first
seven years of his association with
commercial affairs. Even in those
days his keen interest in the welfare
of his fellows was pronounced, for


he was active in the promotion of
temperance and other causes and
proved his organizing ability as a
member of the Galway Commercial
Young Men’s Sodality, and in the
promotion of athletic sport as hon.
secretary of St. Patrick’s Rowing

Club. His Brisbane career has ex-
tended over a period of thirty-seven
years, for he arrived here from his
native land in 1886. Throughout
that period he has been stanch to
his principles and fearless in their
expression, and has commanded uni-
versal respect for his integrity, his
upright, stainless character and fine
example of citizenship. His first
association in Brisbane with the
trade of which he is now so promi-
nent a representative, was as an
employe of the firm of Finney,
Isles & Co., which he left to join Mr.
T. J. Geoghegan, draper. From
1889 until 1896, when he contested
and won the Fortitude Valley Seat,
he was engaged in the establishment
of Edwards & Lamb in Queen Street;
and in 1901 he started indepen-
dently, forming in conjunction with
Mr. East, the well-known firm of
McDonnell & East, of which, with
his partner, he is co-managing
director. As a young man in Bris-
bane, he was quick to see the possi-
bilities of activity in the interests of
factory and shop workers, and after
three years’ residence in the country,
set about the task of organizing the
Shop Assistants’ Early Closing Asso-
ciation. Seven years of constant
effort elapsed ere the first step was
taken by the Government of the day
with the passing of the Factories and
Shops Act of 1897 towards allevia-
ting the conditions under which shop
and factory assistants carried out
their duties, but eventually he had
the great satisfaction of being instru-
mental in securing the Early Closing
Act of 1900, a very liberal measure
dealing with the early closing of
shops In the meantime, in 1891,
he was nominated by the trade
organizations of Queensland as a
representative on the Royal Commis-
sion for shops, factories and work-
shops, in due course receiving
the appointment from the Govern-
ment which also appointed him
a trustee of the Trades Hall.
In 1893, in the interests of
Labour, he contested, though un-
successfully, the Fortitude Valley
Electorate, but three years later
again stood for the Party and after
a hard fight was returned ; and from
1896 until 1907, having successively
topped the poll at the three interven-
ing elections, continued the trusted
member for the same constituency.
Early in 1907, through ill health, he
retired from active political life ; and
he did not again nominate for the
Valley. However, he was not long
permitted to remain in retirement,
for in the same year came the call to
the Legislative Council, with which
he continued to be associated until its
abolition in the year 1982. Through-
out his career in the Lower House,
he worked unceasingly to bring
about legislation for the benefit of
the workers and for the advance-
ment of our educational status, one
of the results effected largely through
his efforts being the Grammar School
Scholarships Act, by which thou-
sands of young Queenslanders have
benefited. He was elected at its in-
ception a member of the Senate of
the University of Queensland, and
held that position until the year
1922, when he resigned. While work-
ing strenuously for the good of his
adopted country, his interest in his
native land continued as strong as in
his young days, for as always with
the highest minds, whatsoever their
creed, politics or nationality, amor
'patriae is one of his most distinctive
attributes. Thus we find him among
the delegates of 1898, and in Syd-
ney, a pall bearer at the funeral of
Michael Dwyer. As a public
man he was not able to devote much
time to private business affairs, but
since his retirement from politics he
has applied his exceptional gifts
towards furthering the interests of
the firm of which he is the head and
whose establishment ranks to-day as
one of the leading City houses. Mr.
McDonnell has his home at Eagle
Junction, Clayfield, where are to be
seen many presentations which tes-
tify to' the goodwill in which he has
been always held and include an
address and presentation watch from
the Galway Commercial Young
Men’s Sodality, a gold ring from a
temperance society, an address and
gold watchguard from old shopmates,
an address accompanied by a purse
of sovereigns from the shop assist-
ants of Queensland and a massive
marble clock from his old political
comrades in memento of their appre-
ciation of his services as secretary
and whip to the Parliamentary
Labour Party. But probably none
among such evidences of esteem and
affection are more highly treasured
than an address, a gold watch and
chain and an extremely beautiful
diamond necklet for Mrs. McDonnell,
presented him by the people of
Fortitude Valley whom he so faith-
fully represented in Parliament for
eleven years —in which striking testi-
mony of the people’s gratitude a
number of his most prominent politi-
cal opponents joined most heartily.
MR. F. J. MCDONNELL.
Mr. McDonnell married Mary,
daughter of Mr. William Heffernan,
of Tipperary, and has a family of
four sons and three daughters. Of
his sons, the eldest, Mr. Francis
John McDonnell, is engaged with
him in business.


JAMES ALEXANDER PHILP,
author, poot, and journalist, Bris-
bane. Though a native of Scotland,
the subject of this article is an Aus-
tralian by adoption, having been
resident in the Commonwealth since
the eighties and a citizen of Bris-
bane for upwards of twenty-two
years. During that period he has
added to the distinction previously
achieved in journalistic circles, while
his work has become widely recog-
nized by all classes of the community.
The line from which he springs is
one of the most historical in Scot-
land, Mr. Philp being the oldest
living representative of the senior
branch of an old Fifeshire family—
Philp of Boar Hill—which was
regarded as one of prominence in
Fife and Forfar for nearly 300 years.
Boar Hill was held by the family
until 1828, and in the family bury-
ing ground at St. Regulus, St.
Andrews, Fife, may be seen the
ancient tomb of the Philps and
records of various interments since
1665, a date which appears on the
earliest of their monuments extant.
Much of interest relating to the line
may be gleaned from the “Register
under the Seals of the Kings of
Scotland,” “The Philp Annals,”
“The Grameid” (James Philp, of
Almerieclose), the 1922 edition of
“Who’s Who in Australia” (Fred.
Johns), “Eminent Arbroathians”
(J. M. Mcßain, F.S.A.), “St.
Andrew’s Kirk Session Registrar
from 1559 to 1600” (Scottish His-
tory Society Series), and other
volumes, its descent being traceable
from beyond the period when Scot-
tish history becomes to be regarded
as authentic. Among numerous
of its members who were dis-
tinguished in Scottish ecclesiastical,
professional, clerical, or military life
at later periods were John Philp,
the last Abbot of Lindores; Dr.
Henry Philp, D.D., one of the first
divines of the Church of Scotland
to obtain the degree of Doctor of
Divinity at St. Andrew’s; and
James Philp, an elegant Latin poet
who was quoted by Macaulay. The
last-mentioned was standard-bearer
to his cousin by marriage, Viscount
Dundee, at the battle of Killie-
ciankie, and in the works above
referred to many others of the name
are mentioned as having played their
parts in notable episodes that add to
the sum of Scottish history. The
first Countess of Leven and the wife
of the famous Archbishop Burnet
were members of this family. Having
come to New Zealand with his
parents when a child, Mr. Philp was
educated successively at the Hauraki
Grammar School and the Auckland
College and Grammar School, and
gave early evidence of the mentality
which later distinguished him, the
records of the last-named seminary

showing that he twice tied E. M.
Brissenden (now a member of the
Judiciary of New South Wales) for
a Latin prize, the pair being subse-
quently bracketed aequus. His first
connection with journalism was on
the staff of the Thames Star, for
which he occasionally wrote leaders
before he had attained the age of
eighteen. In his nineteenth year
he won the prize offered by the New
Zealand Local Committee for the
CREST AND MOTTO OF THE PHILP FAMILY.
best description of the goldfields to
accompany the gold exhibits at the
Sydney Exhibition of that year; and
two years later he joined the staff of
the A uckland Star as Parliamentary
correspondent. For the following five
years he was in regular attendance
at the Parliamentary sessions
in Wellington, and during that
period became intimately associated
with Sir George Grey, Sir Harry
Atkinson, Sir Julius Vogel, Mr.
Ballance, the Wakefields, Mr. Sed-
don, and other giants of the New
Zealand political arena. In New
Zealand, in 1885, his first contribu-
tions to the Sydney Bulletin were
penned; and subsequently, taking
up his residence in the oldest city of
the Commonwealth, be became a
member of the staff of that widely-
read publication, to which he has
now been a contributor for nearly
forty years. While in Sydney he
was connected with the founding of
the first Chinese newspaper pub-
lished in Australia. He was a
foundation member of the Dawn and
Dusk Club, a Bohemian association
which counted among its adherents
such well-known litterateurs as V.
J. Daley, Rod. Quinn, E. J. Brady,
R. Bedford, Bertram Stevens, and
Harry Lawson, and is amusingly
dealt with in George Taylor’s book,
“Those were the Days.” In the
year 1900, Mr. Philp came to join
the staff of the Brisbane Courier,
his association with which has con-
tinued during the past twenty-two
years. His literary output includes
much political and satirical verse,
portion of which is embodied in a vol-
ume entitled “Jingles that Jangle,”
and an interesting book called “Some
Bulletin Stories.” In the Australian
edition of “Webster’s Dictionary”
his name appears as having assisted
in fixing the pronunciation of Maori
place names for the Gazeteer
attached to the work. He also con-
tributed to Professor Morris’ book,
“Austral English,” supplying many
definitions of slang words. A col-
lector of Australiana, the works of
our poets have an honoured place
among his literary treasures, which
include some original MSS. Among
his possessions is an MSS. death roll
of the Australians during the Boer
War, this being the record kept by
a succession of sergeants-in-charge
of the Depot of Overseas Colonials
at Cape Town. Mr. Philp has made
many friends in the course of his
Brisbane career, and has been to the
fore in most movements that count
for the uplift of the race, his loyalty,
especially, finding ample scope dur-
ing the Great War of 1914-18. Of his
family two sons, N. F. B. and R. F.
Philp, upheld the honour of his
name and line in the ranks of the
12 th Brigade (mobile) Australian
Field Artillery during the Great
War.

alternative form, McDuff, recalls
much that is stirring in Scottish
history. Into pastoral and agricul-
tural pursuits Mr. Kennedy was


born, his father and more distant
forbears having been fanners. He
attended a Presbyterian Church
school in his native town until arriv-
ing at the age of fifteen, when, on

the home acres, he entered upon the
uneventful round of farm duties,
performed well if one may judge
from subsequent events, until he had
passed his twenty-third birthday.
Having at about this time heard
from a friend newly returned from
Queensland —a relative of the highly
reputed Scottish-Australian states-
man, the late Sir Thomas Mcllwraith
—of the vast resources awaiting
development at the hands of men
sufficiently courageous to confront
the perils, difficulties, and hardships
with which Nature guards her trea-
sures from those who, for pure love
of achievement or the benefit of their
kind, would wrest from her, he
became keenly desirous of trying his
fortune in the land of the Southern
Cross, and shortly put his wish in
the way of materialization by
Mr. Macdonald Patterson, who
afterwards became so well known
in the Queensland political arena.

mangrove-fringed river; the dusky
children of the wilds whose curiosity
was as yet keenly responsive to such
a somewhat bewildering effect. How-
ever, the element of adventure was
uppermost in his mind, and very
shortly he was on his way to “Rio”
Station, on the Dawson, then the
property of Mr. Peter Mclntosh and
in course of formation. He remained
on the Dawson for twelve months,
moving to “Wealwandangie” Sta-
tion, on the Comet River, immedi-
ately after the acquirement by Mr.
Mclntosh of that country for pas-
toral purposes. He assisted in the
formation of both “Rio” and “Weal-
wandangie,” and on these stations
experienced to the full the adverse
conditions incidental to the develop-
ment of virgin country in the sixties.
The blacks were, of course, a con-
tinual menace, having but a very
short time previously committed the
atrocities known as the “Cullin-la-
ringo” massacre, the punishment
meted out for which, however,
helped to safeguard other pastoral-
ists. Mr. Kennedy acted as sheep

“Persia,” the first vessel to make
the voyage direct from England
to Rockhampton. On the “Persia”
he had as a fellow-passenger
happenings as the arrival of river
craft with their human freight; the
rough methods of existence pursued
by many of the whites; the seeming
infinity of the bush, must have had
about ten years, in 1870, when the
sugar industry was in the height of
its prosperity, being one of those who
tried his hand at cane culture in the
Rockhampton district. His venture


proved a failure owing to the un-
suitability of the land for cane, so he
returned to the industry of larger
issues for which his temperament
was more fitted, proceeding to the
Barcoo to manage “Lome” Station
for his old employer, Mr. Mclntosh.
“Lome” Station knew him until
1875, when it was sold, Mr. Ken-
nedy then becoming the owner and
manager of “Emmet Downs,” on the
Barcoo. This station continued in
his possession for a short time only,
as he was among the earliest to
realize the potentialities of the vast
pastoral lands of the North-west
and pioneer this wild and till then
almost unknown country. As an
interesting sidelight on the rapid
“Buckingham Downs” and “Noran-
side” Stations. On his immense
holdings he immediately inaugurated
the necessary developmental opera-
tions, retaining ownership of the
runs until 1881, when he sold them
and took up, in the Burke district,
territory which he named “Calton
Hills,” after the famous Edin-
burgh heights. His acquirement
of “Calton Hills” was followed by
the purchase of “Bushy Park,” a
fine property lying 70 miles south-
west of Cloncurry, and “Parkside,”
at the head of the Leichhardt River.
“Bushy Park” was purchased from
the Messrs. Whitman Bros., and
after this station and “Parkside”
came into his possession he was the
forced to hand their properties over
to mortgagees, as manager for whom
Mr. Kennedy remained on, however,
until 1907, when the stations were
sold. At about this time his con-
nection with the mining industry
began in association with Mr. Ernest
Henry, the discoverer of the Clon-
curry coppei field in 1866. Messrs.
Kennedy and Henry were partners
in many mining shows, that yielding
by far the most satisfactory results
being the Duchess, which they sold
out to the present Hampden Co. in
1907 for £15,000. Mr, Kennedy
took a trip to Scotland, and on his
return to Queensland in 1910 re-
purchased “Bushy Park.” He re-
tained this property for the following
strides which science has made within
the last fifty years, as well as upon
the history of a notable pioneer, it
should be mentioned here that the
first passenger to travel by air over
the route between Charleville,
Southern Queensland, and Clon-
curry, away in the North-west, .was
Mr. Kennedy, the man who pro-,
spected the heart of Northern
Queensland, when it was yet prac-
tically terra incognita. Purchasing
stock at Rockhampton he overlanded
to the North Gregory, there taking
up in the vicinity of the present
town of Boulia, at no great distance
from the South Australian border,
the vast areas comprised in what
afterwards became well known as
MR. KENNEDY’S HOME AT AUCHENFLOWER.
owner of 3,000 square miles of
country and herds aggregating a
strength of about 60,000 head. In
the year 1888, a partnership was
formed between Mr. Kennedy and
Mr. Roger Sheaffe, of “Devonoourt”
Station, these gentlemen combining
interests. As a result of the con-
nection, “Calton Hills” and “Bushy
Park” became company concerns.
During the many years that the part-
nership lasted, as in the earlier part
of his career, Mr. Kennedy’s experi-
ences were of a kind that would
make an interesting volume. He and
his partner were among the gallant
battlers who, faced with bad seasons,
poor markets, and stock epidemics
in quick succession, were finally
ten years, selliim it in 1920 to
the well-known pastoral firm of
Burns and Johnstone. In the year
1871 he married Miss Murray,
daughter of the late Peter Murray’
Of the part which this lady played
in the history of settlement in the
North-west, it would at this date be
difficult to convey a just estimate, so
different are present-day conditions
from those prevailing in the seven-
ties, eighties, and even much later,
Some idea may be formed of the
hardships which she cheerfully shared
with her pioneer husband, and of the
sacrifices which the circumstances of
the times continually demanded of
both, when it is mentioned that
the vast distances separatum their


station homes from town centres of
civilization often constituted a serious
problem in regard to provisions, in-
cluding the bare necessities of life.
When in occupation of their station
near Boulia, they were dependent
upon supplies from Nornianton, the
nearest port and 400 miles away,
the journey being on© which in
adverse seasons took a team consider-
ably more than six months to
accomplish. It is easily conceivable
in what state of deterioration the
stores often arrived, on© of the most
essential items, flour, generally
reaching the homestead so permeated
with weevils that no us© could be
made of it until it had been care-
fully passed through a very fine
sieve. Mrs. Kennedy, in the homes
which she helped to make “out-
back,” was often separated by two
and three hundred miles from any of
her own sex, excepting the aboriginal
women who acted as domestics and
were often her sole companions when
her husband and others of the sta-
tion were absent on business con-
nected with the run. On one such
occasion, now about forty-six years
ago, a most cruel massacre was com-
mitted at Sulieman Creek by an
exceedingly fierce race of aborigines
known as the Calcadoon tribe, the
victims being a Russian named
Mnlvo and three stockmen, who
with him as partners had brought
the stock and all the equipment
necessary for the formation of a
station to the rough country in the
ranges lying eight miles from the
temporary homestead of the Ken-
nedys. This dwelling, which was
occupied at the time of the murder
by Mrs. Kennedy, her sister, Mrs.
Currie, her brother-in-law, Mr.
Currie, and their small children, was
built entirely of reedy grass and
offered very frail protection against
a horde of savages. Mrs. Kennedy
and her companions were made aware
of their grave position by the
domestic aboriginal women, who
understood enough of the language
of the Calcadoon tribe to have
learned of the intended massacre of
all at the homestead. The savages,
who were prevented from carrying
out their design by the timely arrival
of a detachment of the Native
Mounted Police —a body which by
the courage and untiring energy of
its members made settlement possible
in the district and safeguarded the
settlers and their properties—were
meted severe retribution for the
Sulieman Creek murders. Many
stories are told of the dangers ex-
perienced by the early pioneers of
North-western Queensland, but few
have known more perilous times
than Mr. Alexander Kennedy. It
is related of him and a companion
that once, towards the end of an
intensely hot dry day, when endeav-
ouring, with empty waterbags and
knocked-up horses, to reach the
Burke River, he was faced with the
problem of how to get over the long-
stage yet to be accomplished. Only
those who know this country and
the climate can realize the full
seriousness of such a position. His
companion, though much the
younger man, had collapsed, so Mr.
Kennedy, as the only means of sav-
ing either of their lives, pushed on.
Fortunately, before he had continued
the journey a great distance he came
upon a patch of moist mud left by
a passing thunderstorm earlier in
the day. With much difficulty he
brought to the spot his mate, who,
lapping the liquid mud, was saved
from a dreadful death and restored
to sufficient vigour to resume the
journey. On another occasion, when
exploring the head of the Leichhardt
River with the late Ernest Eglinton,
he and that gentleman had the mis-
fortune to find themselves destitute
of food. We quote the words of the
latter: —“The last of our provisions
had been consumed two days earlier;,
the country was so rough that we
had to lead our horses, when the
writer was lucky enough to shoot
with a revolver a lonely pelican.
This we cut up and boiled in a billy-
can. . . . After a hearty meal
we turned into our blankets; but no
sleep for us. The flavour of that
pelican I will never forget.
The following morning we came
across a mob of cattle, and by the
camp fire enjoyed a bullock steak,
forgetting our previous night’s sup-
per.” The same writer, who was
more than once faced with the
various forms of death then lurking
in these arid wastes, describes Mr.

son of the late Rev. C. P. P. Jod-
rell, M.A., Oxford, and rector of
Wramplingham, Norfolk. The well-
known English county family from
which he is descended has contributed
prominent members to both Church
and State, and earned distinction
through various of its members in
widely-separated portions of the
Empire. Sir Neville Jodrell, the
present member for King’s Lynn in
the British House of Commons, is
first cousin to the subject of our
memoir, whose brother, the late P.
N. Jodrell, 8.A., Oxford, was well
known as a barrister in Brisbane pro-
fessional circles in the early nine-
ties, and later in Western Australia.
Mr. C. E. Jodrell was educated at
Bishop Stortford Grammar School
and Great Yarmouth Grammar
School. At Bishop Stortford he had
as fellow-students the famous British
administrator and empire builder,
the late Right Hon. Cecil John
Rhodes, and his brother, Frank
Rhodes, sons of the vicar of Bishop
Stortford. On leaving school,
prompted by that love of adventure
which has been responsible for the
extension of Empire from the time
that the Motherland first established
her suzerainty over far-distant lands,
Mr. Jodrell undertook the journey
to Australia, travelling by the
Orient liner “Lusitania,” and arriv-
ing in Victoria in 1879. Three years
later he made his advent to Queens-
land, and from 1882 onwards, and
for some years, followed station life.
Mining then occupied him for a
period on the Palmer goldfield in its
prosperous days, and since the time
of his first association with the fields
he has been more or less interested
in mining, at one .time owning, in
conjunction with Inspector H. Fitz-
Gerald and Sub-Inspectors Brooke,
Marrett, and Margetts the well-
known Monte Christo Mine, which
was situated at the Normanby, near
“Butcher Hill” Station, in the dis-
trict outlying Cooktown. Later he
entered the sugar industry with the

purchase from the C.S.R. Co. of
valuable sugar lands which originally
formed part of “Goondi” plantation.
This was in 1893. In 1909 he pur-
chased, in conjunction with Mr. Wil-
liam Stevenson, the property now
known as the l “Turalba” Sugar
Estate. Mr. Jodrell has interesting
reminiscences of Cooktown, a centre
with all the advantages necessary for
the formation of an important sea-
port, which, in the prosperous days
of the Palmer goldfield, it gave every
promise of becoming, and many of
whose citizens of earlier years became
notable in various fields of public
activity in the South, these includ-
ing the late W. V. Ralston, for
many years general manager of the
Queensland National Bank, Ltd.;
Mr J. Mackenzie Lees, general
manager of the Bank of Queensland,
Ltd. ;°Mr, E. B. Wareham, general
manager of the Adelaide Steamship
Co., Ltd., in Sydney; the late B. W.
Macdonald, of Macdonald, Hamilton
and Co., Australasian United Steam
Navigation Co.; Mr. Bell, Chief
Engineer for Commonwealth Rail-
ways ; Mr. Hobler, Assistant
Engineer for Commonwealth Rail-
ways; Inspector Urquhart, after-
wards Commissioner of Police; Mr.
H. Milman, P.M.; Mr. Donaldson;
and others. During his lengthy
sojourn in the North, Mr. Jodrell
actively participated in many public
movements. In 1921 he was ap-
pointed vice-president of the Austra-
lian Sugar Producers’ Association.
He has been president, since its in-
ception, of the Innisfail Railway
League, which was mainly respon-
sible for the extension of the Cairns-
Innisfail railway into the Innisfail
district, and held the same office in
connection with the first Chamber
of Commerce formed in Innisfail,
and the Johnstone River Cane
Growers’ Association, having for
twenty-five years been a member of
the executive of the latter body. For
more than twelve years he was a
councillor of the Johnstone Shire,
and in 1907 was appointed its
MR. C. N. E. JODRELL.
chairman. Always keenly alive to the
political outlook, he was asked by
the late Sir Robert Philp in 1908 to
contest the Herbert seat in the
Liberal interests. He is a director


of the Johnstone River Co-operative
Butchering Co., and for ten years
was chairman of Sir Alfred Cowley’s
Innisfail Election Committee, and

EDWARD GODDARD BLUME,
of “Stanley Hall,” Ascot, and pro-
prietor of “Bexley,” “Oakleigh
Park,” “Yanburra,” “Forrester,”
“Dunrobin,” “Glenrobin,” and
MR. E. G. BLUME.
“Woodlands,” was born at Mount
Gambier, South Australia, in the
year 1865, and is the son of the late
C. A. Blume, who was the owner of
considerable landed estate in Vic-
toria and South Australia, to the
pastoral development of which States,
when in the early stages of coloniza-
tion, the late gentleman by his
initiative, enterprise and activities
in various directions very largely
contributed. Mr. E. G. Blume
was educated at Hamilton, Vic-
toria, and on completing there
the usual secondary school course
entered the pastoral industry, of
which from early childhood, with the
exception of breaks demanded by his
studies, he had assimilated a gradual
knowledge under the guidance of his
father. At the age of 18 he was
considered sufficiently experienced to
take control of one of the latter’s
sheep stations, and before very long
the results of his management of this
run proved him well fitted to cope
with the issues involved in big under-
takings. While engaged in man-
agerial duties in the South, he
gauged the pastoral possibilities of
the vast spaces awaiting development
in Queensland, especially in the Cen-
tral-western Division, and anxious to
apply his knowledge of the wool in-
dustry to land which he realized
needed only the initiative and capital
to bring its wonderfully productive
powers to full fruition, visited this
State with the view of obtaining
country. He arrived in Brisbane in
the year 1889, being then in his early
twenties. From Brisbane he pro-
ceeded to the Mitchell district, rail-
ing to Barcaldine, at that time the
terminus of the Central Queensland
railway. Thence he travelled by
coach to Aramac and on to Mutta-
burra, which centre he made his
headquarters while inspecting land
likely to suit his purpose. His choice
fell on the area since known as “Bex-
ley,” and which, prior to his selec-
tion, formed part of the resumption
of the historical “Bowen Downs”
Station. At this time also, on his
brother’s behalf, he selected from the
MR. E. C. BLUME.
same resumption the area now desig-
nated “Camoola Park.” Time
proved the “Bexley” venture to be
all he anticipated, and eight years
later, in 1898, he purchased “Needle-
wood,” comprising 40,000 acres. This
property he subsequently disposed of.
His next Central Queensland pur-
chases were “Kankania” and
“Thorby,” acquired in 1899 and
1907, respectively, and eventually
sold. In 1908, the year following
the disposal of “Thorby,” he pur-
chased “Oakleigh Park,” a freehold
lying about 40 miles from Toowoom-
ba and six miles from the Bowen-
ville railway station, and a year later
added still further to his pastoral
interests by purchasing country
adjoining “Bexley,” known as
“Yanburra,” and, at a subsequent
date, three adjoining grazing farms,
the area of which, added to that of
“Bexley” and “Yanburra,” makes
an acreage of 100,000, “Yanburra”
containing 40,000 acres. “Oakleigh
Park,” his Toowoomba freehold
property, is comprised of 17,000 acres
of the best farming lands on the Dar-
ling Downs. It has a double frontage
to Oakey Creek, the splendid natural
water afforded by this stream being
supplemented by wells put down
since Mr. Blume became the owner.
At “Oakleigh Park” excellent
supplies have been obtained at depths
varying from 50 to 100 feet. “Bex-
ley,” “Yanburra,” and the adjoin-
ing properties are furnished with a
fine water supply from flowing bores,
numerous dams, and the Thomson
River, on which they are situated.
In addition to the various holdings
already mentioned, Mr. Blume owns
“Woodlands,” a very fine Hunter
River property devoted to stud pur-
poses and adjoining several other
well-known stud farms on the Upper
Hunter, and in Central Queensland,
“Dunrobin,” “Glenrobin” (adjoin-
ing properties), “Forrester,” and the
adjoining property, “Wallaroo.”
“Woodlands” is an ideal breeding es-
tablishment and bears a notable
reputation throughout the Continent
for the class of stock produced on its
pastures, the well-known racer,

“Paris,” and several others of his
calibre having been bred here.
“Dunrobin,” purchased in the year
1910 has an area of 257 square miles
situated 50 miles from Aramac and


70 from Jericho, and “Glenrobin,”
comprising 38,000 acres, carry herds
aggregating 10,000 head, and horses
to the number of 300. “Wallaroo,”
his latest Queensland investment,
and “Forrester” are stocked with
9,000 cattle and 150 horses. “For-
rester” lies 11 miles from “Dun-
robin” and is situated on the
Belyando, being bountifully watered
by this stream, Sandy Creek, and
Lake De Gulla—a fine sheet of water
21 miles in length and having a depth
of 28 feet. All Mr. Blume’s rune
are most highly developed, and on
most of them horse, sheep, and
cattle-breeding operations are carried
the price commanded by fats and for
wool—both scoured and in the
grease. He usually puts 70,000
sheep to the shears annually, this
work being done by contract and con-
tinued practically the whole year
round. His long and thorough ex-
perience of the industry has taught
him how to secure the best results,
and these he has certainly attained
in all departments of his extensive
operations. The “Bexley” wool sold
up to 33fd. per lb. in the grease in
June, 1923, topping the market for
the sales and the season. His stud
cows run to 300 head of which
100 are on “Oakleigh Park,” the
“Woodripe.” “St. Savin” is a par-
ticularly beautiful specimen of the
“St. Simon” stock. This horse, like
“Persimmon,” was sired by “St.
Simon” out of a mare by “Hamp-
ton,” and was bought at the dis-
posal sale of the “St. James” stud
in March of the year 1913 for 3,000
guineas. “Earlston” is an imported
son of “Wisdom” and “Lovelorn,”
and is the sire of “Earl Kitchener,”
the winner of two Queensland cups,
and “ Ulandra” and other good per-
formers on Southern courses. He
won the Champion badge in the
blood section of the Brisbane Show
or 1920—a distinction well merited

on. He stocked “Bexley” originally
with ewes from “Darr River
Downs,” “Stainburn Downs,”
“Kynuna,” and “East Talgai.” For
the formation of the well-known
“Bexley” stud, he purchased all the
stock comprising Mr. Fairfax’s “Dal-
more” stud, adding further pur-
chases from “Glengallan,” Mr.
Slade’s famous stud, and from the
Sydney sheep sales. His penchant
for “Wanganella” plain-bodied
sheep is evident in the stamp pro-
duced at “Bexley,” which property
has as enviable a reputation as his
Darling Downs station for the pro-
duction of wool and mutton, and for
remainder having their home on the
“Bexley” pastures. For his cattle
studs he has made purchases of “Dal-
more” (Victoria), “Angas” (South
Australia), and .“Lyndhurst”
(Queensland) bulls, among the sires
used in the past being “Royal Bril-
liant,” “Royal Caledonia,” “Duke
of Babton,” “Bonnie Laddie,” and
many others, the reigning bulls being
equal in all respects to those men-
tioned. He has bred numerous fine
specimens of equine stock, owning
many studbook mares and stallions.
Among the latter are “Earlston,”
“En Haut,” “St. Savin,” “Flying
Machine,” “All Trumps,” and
according to the opinion in which
he is held, also, by recognized
Southern authorities on the breed-
ing of blood stock. “En Haut,”
by “Haut Brion” and “Trieste,”
“Earlston,” “St. Savin,” and “Fly-
ing Machine” are doing stud duty
at “Bexley”; “All Trumps” and
“Viscount Alwyne” are at “Dun-
robin” ; and “Sunline” is at “ For-
rester.” The stallions at present in
use at the “Woodlands” Stud Farm
are “Shepherd King” (imp.), “Duke
Humphrey (imp.), and “Piastre.”
“Shepherd King” was purchased by
Mr. Blume at auction in 1918 for
3,500 guineas. The chief events of

his fine record are the Caulfield
Cup, which he won in 191 G, and the
Melbourne Cup in which he ran
second to "Sasanof.” He is by
"Martagon,” the sire of the leading
New Zealand stud home, "Mar-
tian,” out of the "St. Simon” mare,
"St. Windeline,” a dam of the
English St. Leger winner, "Wool
Winder.” His first season produced
"Salatis,” for whom as a two-year-
old it is weil known that an offer of
10,000 guineas was refused, ‘Lorna
B” and "Shepherd Queen,” all of
whom have taken after him in good
looks and soundness of constitution.
"Salatis,” who is out of “Traquette,”
made a brilliant debut as the cham-
pion two-year-old of Victoria, where
he won the Maribyrnong Trial
Stakes at Flemington and was suc-
cessful at Caulfield in handicap
races in which he was weighted up to
9 st. 13 lb. These performances had
the effect of drawing attention to
"Shepherd King” as the probable
sire of great racehorses, and when
his second batch of yearlings went
into the sale ring in March, 1921,
they realized very high prices. In
1923, however, these prices were ex-
ceeded, for in that year one of his
sons out of "Miss Muriel,” the dam
of the great Queensland performer,
"Amberdown,” was sold as a "Wood-
lands” yearling for 1,300 guineas
—a record price for Queensland.

“Kingslot,” another of his sons
and who won the Queensland
Guineas, Derby, and Cup, was sold
as a three-year-old for 3,000
guineas. “Shepherd King” is
admitted to bo one of the finest-look-
ing stallions ever imported to Aus-
tralia, and bids well to become
famous. “Piastre” is the Austra-
lian-bred son of “Positano,” who
was for many years the most distin-
guished of the many fine horses pro-
duced by “St. Simon” at the stud

while his dam, "Chand Bee Bee,”
was one of the highest class of
imported mares. Among the many
winners of classic races and impor-
tant handicaps produced by her was
the great mare, “Chantress,” who
as a three-year-old won the New-
market Handicap for Mr. William
Brown and subsequently beat that
queen of the turf, “Wakeful,” in
the All-aged Stakes. “Piastre” was
renowned as a great stayer, his win-
nings including the V.R.C. weight-
for-age Loch Plate, 2 miles; the
Champion Stakes, 3 miles; the
A.J.C. Autumn Stakes, H miles;
and the Caulfield Stakes, 2 miles,
the final event in his glorious racing
career being the winning of the Mel-
bourne Cup in 1912. At the disper-
sal of the “Segenhoe” Stud,
“Piastre” was purchased by the
Defence Department for a remount
sire and for some time subsequently
was used at the Remount Depot at
Maribyrnong, Victoria. However,
wdien Iris son, ‘‘Millieme,” beat the
great "Artilleryman” in the A.J.C.
St. Leger Stakes of 1920, his great-
ness was emphasized, and the Gov-
ernment was prevailed upon to put
"Piastre” in the market for sale.
The result was that Mr. Blume be-
came his purchaser, paying for him
2,100 guineas as a sire for the
"Woodlands” stud. "Duke Hum-
phrey,” who is beautifully bred,
having been sired by the "Isinglass”
—"La Fleche” sire "John o’ Gaunt”
from "Valve” by the champion
stakes winner, "Velasquez,” from
"Gas” (dam of Derby winner,
"Cicero”) by "Ayrshire,” was pur-
chased by Mr. Blume some years
ago. His stock have all done well
on Queensland courses. "Wood-
lands” is the home of a collection
of the best mares to be found in
Australia, their names being suffi-
ciently familiar to obviate further
reference to their merits. The list
includes "Lady Medallist,” winner
of the Caulfield Cup, A.J.C. Craven

won in New Zealand, the remainder,
£6,786, being the result of her per-
formances since coming into Mr.
Blume’s jmssession, these including

that Mr. Blume’s blood stock have
continued to make his name and col-
ours (black jacket, white sleeves,
pink arm-bands and cap) famous on
the Australian turf, such racers as

ous good handicaps in Queensland,
and “Foremast,” a filly of his own
breeding who won the Q.T.C. Hope-
ful Stakes, “Irish Colleen” and
many others have reigned as public
favourites. The owner of “Wood-
lands” is not only an expert judge
of horseflesh, but distinguished as
having been an excellent rider whose
knowledge of his mount has been
apparent at many amateur meetings
including an occasion at Longreach
when he established a record by win-
ing every race on the programme,
riding his own horse in every event
save one—a hurdle race—which he
won on a friend’s mount of his own
training. Like the majority of suc-
cessful pastoralists, he has experi-
enced to the full the responsibilities
and anxieties that are the inevitable
accompaniment of big ventures, and
felt the brunt of adverse seasons,
changing markets, stock epidemics,
and other conditions which tax the
ability and resources of the station
holder so heavily. He was a great
loser by the drought of 1900-3,
which claimed from him large num-
bers of horned and equine stock, and
35,000 sheep, despite the big fight
which he made against the rainless
conditions —scrub being continuously
cut for feed, and heavy expenses in-
curred for agistment country, arti-
ficial fodder, and freight. The
demands made on his time by the
multiplicity of his affairs preclude
to any great extent his participa-
tion in public life, the undoubted
value of his citizenship lying in his
enterprise and powers of organiza-
tion as applied to the great industry
of which he is so prominent a repre-
sentative. He married in the year
1899, Florence Lucy, daughter of
Mr. E. F. Craven, of Roma, Queens-
land, and has a family of two sons

and two daughters. When in Bris-

from which a delightful view, em-
bracing the river and Moreton Bay,

also the owner of a fine seaside pro-
perty, “Morven.” at Sandgate.

without number, and which demanded
the full exercise of the qualities of
foresight, initiative, and persever-
ance with which he is endowed, Mr.
Moffat deservedly ranks as one of the

most enterprising and successful of
our pioneers. His determined energy
has carried him far beyond the goal
at which most men aim, and now he
enjoys at his beautiful suburban
aaa2
home the retirement which, in more
youthful years, he so hardly earned.
He is one of seven sons born to the
late Archibald Moffat, a Scotchman,
who hailed to Australia from the Old
Land in the year 1844, then enter-
ing upon a career that proved him
typical of the class representing the
young Continent’s most desirable set-
tlers, and worthy of the sturdy race
which gave him birth. Two genera-
tions ago the Moffats were closely
identified with the manufacturing
side of the wool industry in Glasgow,
the grandfather of the gentleman
under review having held interests in
this connection. Archibald Moffat
brought to the country whose devel-
opment he was destined to so materi-
ally assist, his wife and two-year-old
son, John, and originally settled in
MR. G. MOFFAT.
Adelaide, South Australia. After
two years in which were experienced
many hardships, he removed to the
young settlement then occupying the
sit© of the present great City of Mel-
bourne- —in those early days spoken
of as Canvas Town. Here he carried
on in business until the early fifties
when he became one of the pioneers
of Ballarat, which field, like the
other early diggings of Victoria, was
attracting a vast and continual flow
of population from all parts of the
world. With the realization that a
surer road to competence than that
which attracted the vast majority of
his fellows, lay in the direction of
carrying, he, however, entered upon
the arduous and perilous career that,
in those days, such a calling implied,
purchasing for his purpose a horse
and mare for which he paid, respec-
tively, the sums of £9O and £lOO.
Having thus equipped himself with
the necessary outfit, he soon became

ing to the goldfield, to which he con-
veyed the much-needed stores from
Melbourne. As he expected, the un-
dertaking turned out profitably, and

he was soon able to enlarge his opera-
tions by purchasing a bullock team.
While he continued to make the most
of the possibilities of the carrying
business, he became the occupier of a


farm on the Moorabool River, eight
miles from Geelong, but, for the car-
rying out of his progressive and con-
tinually expanding operations, this
property soon proving inadequate in
respect to area, he sold out and
bought land lying 14 miles from the
same centre. His later acquirement
he devoted to wheat-growing and
dairying, and continued to hold until
it also had to be relinquished for the
reason that a larger field was neces-
sary for the investment of such capi-
tal as he had by this time accumu-
lated. Choosing a block in New
South Wales, about 19 miles north-
west of Albury, he moved thither
with wife and family and imme-
diately inaugurated development in
acquired country on the Murrurnbid-
gee Plains. In 1872, when “Curran-
gundi” was sold, the Murrumbidgee
property, lying in the vicinity of
Narrandera and named by the fam-
ily, “Morundah,” became the head-
quarters of the Moffats. Here the
pioneer resided for 12 years,
“Morundah” passing from him by
sale in 1884. Six of his sons having
in the meantime launched out in pas-
toral ventures in Queensland, as
shown in the following pages, he then
took up his residence in the Northern
State, making at Toowoomba a
home which was his headquarters for
the 17 years preceding 1901, when
was closed a life that for nearly 60
years was interwoven with the early
large freehold station near Lock-
hart, Riverina, resides in New
South Wales. The last-named
gentleman, with his sister, Jen-
nie, now the wife of Mr. James
Cameron, “Arbost,” Snowy River,
Gippsland, Victoria, are the only
members of the family the lines ot
whose lives continued to lie in New
South Wales after the middle eigh-
ties. A second daughter of the late
Archibald Moffat became the wife of

named “Moffat Yale.” Subse-
quently, still with the view of expan-
sion, he sold it and took up land
from the Crown at a site distant 30
miles from Louth, thus becoming the
owner of two adjoining blocks aggre-
gating an acreage of 1,500 square
miles. This vast area, on which he
bestowed the name of “Curran-
gundi,” was formed under his in-
structions as a sheep station, three of
his sons, George (the subject of our
memoir), James, and Archibald, hav-
ing overlanded for the purpose 5,000
sheep from “Moffat Vale.” “Curran-

one year only, during which he

Of the family of 10 born to this nota-

studies having been conducted at

overland trip with cattle for the for-
mation of that station in the early
eighties. After a year at “Curran-
gundi,” during which, luxuries, and
in many instances, necessities, were
chiefly conspicuous by their absence,
the sale of the station was effected,
and Mr. George Moffat continned at
“Morundah” his training in the hard
ways of pastoral enterprise as carried
out in those early days. While here
he assisted his father in fighting the
1874 drought, which was the cause
of considerable loss of stock to the
original pioneer, and for the nine
years he was engaged on the station
his full energies were directed to-
wards its successful working. Some
years before “Morundah” was sold
he became aware of the exceptional
station known as “Bloomfield,” in
the Mitchell district, which was pur-
chased from Mr. William Jessop.
In 1882, at the time of the trans-
action, “Bloomfield” carried 14,000
full-woolled sheep, for which the
brothers paid at the rate of 12s. per
head. These were all good stock of
“Jlavilah” breed, and came from the
Archer Bros.’ well-known “Minnie
Downs” Station. At “Bloomfield”
George took control (James having
returned south for a period), and a
very strenuous time he had, the sta-
tion being at that time without fences
and otherwise very little improved,
and the only supplemental supply to
the natural water present on the run
was a 400 gallon tank. Hard work

strangely enough, had received good

flock of 7,000 was practically the
only salvage from the devastation
wrought by the drought, the evils of
which—difficulties in the way of
securing stores and fodder, the tre-
mendous price of carriage, the bare
and parched aspect of the landscape,
the muddied patches where once was
held good water, the continual sight
of dead or dying stock, and the hard
life and fare consequent upon the
times—are vividly recounted by the
pioneer. In those early years at

possibilities awaiting investment on
the land in the then young and
sparsely-populated Colony of Queens-
land, and, eventually, in 1882, the
conviction that capital and the ex-
pert knowledge of stock with which
long experience had equipped them
could not fail to produce desired re-
sults if applied to one or more of the
vast areas then on the market in the
North, he, with his brother, James,
took steamer to Brisbane, whence
they railed to Dalby. Purchasing
horses at this centre, they set out
upon a lengthy tour of inspection
through the Darling Downs and
Maranoa districts, and ended their
journey at the Barcoo. Here, after
having previously inspected many
properties, their choice fell upon the
exercise of foresight continually for
the proper working of the stock which
required most careful shepherding,
was the sum of his existence in those
days. The venture nevertheless con-
tinned to reward his judgment until
1884, when a severe drought neces-
sitated the turning of the stock adrift
owing to the serious water shortage.
Until 1885, which brought the much-
needed rain, the outlook for the
owners of “Bloomfield” was the re-
verse of cheerful, but with the in-
domitable courage which distin-
guished the founder of their line
they carried on in the face of the dis-
aster, much of the evil of the situa-
tion being saved by the sale of 7,000
sheep to the neighbouring station,

of rain were augmented by a disaster
v/hich occurred while Mr. George
Moffat was visiting New South
Wales, James being away at Black-
all, and Hugh engaged on work on
the run far away from the home-
stead. A large consignment of tim-
ber intended for the erection of a
new dwelling, and numerous pieces
comprising furniture all ready to be
fitted together, had been brought
from Rockhampton, and awaited the
leisure of the brothers to be put to
their uses. The whole however
shortly after being stored, was, to-
gether with their temporary home,
provisions, and other bclon<dno-s
totally destroyed by fire supposed'to
have originated by a spark from the
cook-house lighting upon the


thatched roof of the dwelling. In
the year 1885, with the coming of the
rain and the promise of normal sea-
sons, the Messrs. Moffat purchased
from Messrs. Budge & Nile, of
“Delta” Station, 6,000 ewes. This
flock formed the nucleus from which
“Bloomfield” was re-stocked, and
with the advent of a splendid season
in 1886, and the normal years follow-
ing, financial conditions, aided by the
wonderfully recuperative powers of
the country, rapidly improved, so
that in 1886 they were able to muster
a flock of 20,000, and cattle to the
number of 1,000 head. Endowed
with the enterprise which distin-
guished the late Archibald Moffat,

in the nineties the acreage under the
Moffat Bros.’ control aggregated a
figure in the region of 140,000, while
the sheep on their linked stations
totalled 50,000. “Moorlands” con-
tained 40,000 acres; “Prairie” and
“Thornleigh,” 20,000 each; and
“Aberfoyle,” 18,000 acres. The
properties, as purchased, were amal-
gamated, and all were worked as one
proposition until 1898, when a disso-
lution of partnership was mutually
agreed upon by the members compris-
ing the firm of Moffat Bros. Previ-
ously, Mr. George Moffat had centred
his energies chiefly in “Moorlands.”

of 4,000 feet, at which a splendid flow

the circumstance that Mr. Moffat
had been careful not to overstock in
years of plenty having safeguarded
the sheep to the extent that there
was not a mortality at “Moorlands”

trol of his pastoral interests, and set-

of 350, and 15 horses, was added to
their possessions. This was in 1888,
and four years later they became the
purchasers of “Moorlands” from the
Messrs. Murray-Prior. “Moor-

partially improved carrying sheep-

The late PATRICK JOSEPH
DOYLE, Cairns. In measuring
the indebtedness of the Empire
towards the men whose enterprise
and energy have so largely aided
development in Northern Queens-
land, the mind involuntarily reverts
to those whose achievements stand
out as marking the rapid strides
in industrial progress in our
own times. Among the builders
of commerce and industry here
during the past forty years, none
have played a larger part or
produced greater results than the
gentleman whose name figures at the
head of this article. Born at Tul-
low, Carlow, Ireland, on March 1,
1863, Mr. P. J. Doyle was the eldest
son of the late James Doyle, who was
prominently known as a representa-
tive merchant and grazier of Carlow.
His earlier progenitors peopled Kil-
dare, and in old records dating cen-
turies back the family is associated
with some of the most stirring inci-
dents of Irish history, its founder
being chronicled as a Huguenot who
established the line in the coastal
islands of Scotland over three and a
half centuries ago, and whose name,
handed down to his descendants as
Dohl and O'Dohl, was, as frequently
exemplified in cases of other histor-
ical families, spelt in a variety of
ways until the present nomenclature
became generally accepted. During
comparatively recent times the
family has contributed representa-
tives in prominent places in different
fields of activity in Great Britain and
her Dominions, in America and in
Africa, of the brothers of Mr. Doyle
of Cairns one having been well known
in banking circles of New York,
another as English professor at a
college in Algiers, and a third, dur-
ing a career of over thirty-five years,
in Australia. The last-mentioned
gentleman is now actively engaged in
New Guinea. A sister of the subject
of our memoir held the highest hon-
ours possible of attainment in the
Irish musical world, while others of
the name figured notably as educa-
tionists. Mr. P. J. Doyle was prim-
arily educated at the Christian
Brothers’ College in Tullow, and sub-
sequently by private tuition under
Mr. A. M. Church, M.A. Cantab., a
man well known in his day for
scholarly attainments and his apti-
tude for training the minds of those
entrusted to his care. From this
gentleman’s guidance he entered
Bell’s Academy, North Great
George’s Street, Dublin, where he
completed his school life in 1883, and
whence he viewed the world as an
unexplored region teeming with pos-
sibilities from which to choose the
basis of a future career. Australia
presenting the most likely, and the

most attractive, field for his energies,
his decision was soon formed and the
following year found him a new
arrival in the youngest State (then
Colony) of the great Continent which
was destined to become his country
by adoption; and which has been the
gainer by the virility of mind and
body which he brought to her service,
and the industrial achievements
which have evolved from his indom-
itable spirit and untiring energy
during the period which has elapsed
since his welcome to Australian soil.
He terminated his voyage from the
Old World at Townsville, and there
accepted a position, as confidential
secretary to the principals, with the
firm of Rooney Bros., Architects and
Builders, of that city. After three
years’ association in a secretarial
capacity with the business of Messrs.
Rooney Bros., he was offered a post in
the office of Messrs. E. L. Brown &
Co., at Thursday Island. Glad of the
opportunity of seeing a new aspect of
life in Australia, he accepted the posi-
tion in 1887 and immediately entered
upon his new duties in the pearl-
fishing centre lying in Torres Strait,
north-west of the most northerly
point of Queensland. On the con-
clusion of his first six months here,
learning that a better appointment
was available in the shipping office
of the local branch of the business of
Burns, Philp & Co., he decided to
identify himself wdth the interests of
this firm until he had secured a good
grip of the possibilities which the in-
dustries of the Island afforded. Hav-
ing achieved his objective, he made
an independent start on August 1,
1888, by establishing the business
v/hich has since become so well known
under the title of P. J. Doyle, Ltd.,
and which he personally directed for
the following eleven years, operating
principally in the pearl-shelling and
beche-de-mer trades, and, from 1890
onwards, as a wholesale wine and
spirit merchant. During his per-
sonal direction of the business here,
1888 to 1899, his operations w r ere on
a scale sufficiently extensive to merit
for him description as the largest in-
dividual pearl sheller on the Island.
He considerably widened the sphere
of his industry in the year 1899 by
opening up a mercantile establish-
ment in Cairns, thenceforward mak-
ing this town his headquarters and
operating the Tlunsday Island busi-
ness as a branch concern. At
this time he eliminated shelling
from the schedule of his interests, and
in Cairns he found a scope and objec-
tive commensurate with his energy,
which was applied to the extension of
his commercial interests and to the
sugar, dairying and mining industries,
his operations as a cane owner being
on a particularly large scale and com-
prehending a variety of interests. His
first venture in this connection was
the purchase of 1,000 acres of excel-
lent agricultural lands, situated
within two-and-a-half miles of
Cairns Post Office. Portion of this
land he put under cane and the
remainder under lease to those desir-
ous of becoming growers and whose
qualifications he recognized as being
of the kind likely to assist settlement
in a district whose prosperity largely
depends on the development of its
agricultural resources. Thoroughly
imbued with such conviction, he and
the company of which lie was princi-
pal, have largely assisted industry by
financing many now prosperous
farmers who thus equipped have
given considerable impetus to pro-
gression by their efforts and by their
success helped to advertise the
illimitable resources of the country
outlying Cairns. From the point of
view of increased population, merely,
over the fine territory previously
awaiting conquest, the result accom-
plished as the outcome of his initia-
tive surely deserves to be regarded in

the light of a great national achieve-
ment. His landed acquirements in-
cluded, also, a considerable acreage
of country on the tableland, which
proved a line field for investment,
particularly for dairying projects, in
which connection it should be men-
tioned that he was responsible for the
introduction to the district of the
Holstein-Friesian cattle—which have
been rightly described as “the largest
of the dairy breeds, excelling all
others in the quantity of milk
yielded’’—and the consequent im-
provement in the dairying herds
here, a subject which is referred to in
another portion of this work. En
passant it may be mentioned that
with a foresight and large-minded-
ness which looked beyond the pres-
ent, taking count for the benefit
of generations yet unborn, Mr. Doyle
fostered every form of primary pro-
duction, and for his untiring energy
in so many directions his name and
work will live in history as one of
the men to whom the development
of the great empty spaces of the
North was due. He was ever the
moving spirit in any endeavour to
resuscitate interest in the old Palmer
goldfield, backing up his conviction
as to the latent riches of these his-
toric mines by a considerable outlay
of capital and energy. An expendi-
ture of about £4,000 has, up to the
present, been applied to the under-
taking on the Palmer, in which
he was associated with Mr. M.
Boland. It is to be hoped that
the efforts of these gentlemen to
rebuild a great industry in the
North by the development of her
mining resources, will be crowned
with the success they so thoroughly
merit —a success which will bring the
Cook district once more into prom-
inence, infuse fresh impetus to all her
industries, necessitate the creation of
others, and, above all, by providing
employment for thousands, give to
the empty North the population she
so badly needs. Many will remember
the great promise of the Palmer in
the seventies, when the locality was
thronged with a population of the
cosmopolitan order that invariably
marks the early community of a dig-
gings. The river itself was discovered
by the late pioneer, William Hann,
when leading, uhder direction from
the Government of his day, an expe-
dition in search of territory suitable
for settlement. However, to Mr.
James Venture Mulligan, an
explorer to whom the State owes
much, belongs the honour of the dis-
covery of the first payable gold on
the Palmer, which some time ago was
recorded to have yielded metal to the
value of £7,500,000. A report on
Mr. Mulligan’s 1873 explorations
stated that he had found payable
gold for some forty miles in the bed
of the river; and on the strength of
this report was established and
opened up the port of Cooktown, an
event which was followed by further
prospecting on the part of the ex-
plorer and the discovery of payable
gold for eighty miles on the Palmer
and within a radius of forty miles be-
yond the river. After a brief period,
during which radiated from the
field a wonderful prosperity, it was
thought that the gold had practically
given out, an impression which
recent prospecting has largely dis-
pelled. Little has been so far said of
Mr. Doyle’s initiative, acumen, and
enterprise in the commercial world,
but the business of his founding
speaks sufficiently in this matter, the
same keenness and penetration which
he brought to all his ventures
having been fully applied to the
building up of the establishment of
P. J. Doyle, Ltd., whose principal
was so well able to distribute
his energies that the best results
seemed invariably to follow. Straight-
forwardness was perhaps one of
the most marked characteristics of
his temperament, and his averseness
to anything in the way of cant and
insincerity was as well known as is
the fact that men with high ideals
of honour, and combining energy
and perspicacity such as distin-
guished him, make the finest citizens.
He supported various local bodies in
pursuance of his principle of giving
of his best to the interests of the dis-
trict and community, among those
with which he has been connected
being the Cairns Chamber of Com-
merce, of which he was President,
and the Cairns Harbour Board. In
all forms of outdoor sport, his inter-
est could always be counted upon,
particularly such as tended to the
physical well-being of the younger
generation. His personal predilection
was for tennis, in which he more than
held hie own, not only with his
peers, but with the younger men with
whom he contested honours. As
a lover of the equine, he generally
had a horse in training, and his name
figured prominently in the racing
world of Northern Queensland, his
interests in this direction extending
to the metropolitan turf, where his
stock have also been successful.
Among the better known of his
horses are “Moulder” and “Narooa,”
with which he scored numerous
successes in leading events in Towns-
ville, Charters Towers and Cairns.
“Moulder” won the Sandgate Handi-
cap in 1911, while “Narooa” distin-
guished himself as the winner of
the Trial Stakes at Eagle Farm.
Mr. Doyle was for years president of
the local Jockey Club and held hon-
orary office in most of the sporting
clubs of Northern Queensland, in
many of which he fulfilled the func-
tions of patron or president. The
late P. J. Doyle’s residence stands
four miles from Cairns. In a
setting of beautiful grounds it nestles
at the foot of the Coastal Range and
possesses all the appurtenances
which mechanical science has evolved
for adding to the beauty and conven-
ience of a modern dwelling-house,
being besides a veritable repository
of works of art, curios from many
lands, and trophies from Indian
jungle and East African forest—
some of which, both heads and skins,
having come to him as trophies of his
daughter’s skill with the rifle. Most
picturesque are the grounds of this
home, well-kept lawns lending the
charm of contrast to the beauty of
blooms en masse, and harmonizing
with the greenery of tropical foliage
and the variegated tints of shrubs
and other plants. Features of the
place are a very fine tennis court and
Ferro-concrete swimming tank,
23 x 18 x 6. In reference to the
home it is but right to add that the
owner excelled in all the qualities
which proclaim a perfect host, as
many a royally welcomed visitor to
his home can testify. Mr. Doyle
married in the year 1889, Jane,
daughter of the late Thomas Brady,
formerly of Queen’s County, Ire-
land, and a member of a very old
Celtic family whose association with
that County dates back to the time
which has left little more than tradi-
tion as a guide in tracing its passage
for posterity. Of the union there
was one daughter, Alice, now the
wife of Captain Colin Maesmore-
Morris, who is attached to the Army
in India and to whom her marriage
occurred in the year 1920, at Bromp-
ton Oratory, London. The late P.
J. Doyle’s death occurred in August,
1923, and the funeral, which moved
from St. Monica’s church, was the
largest seen in Cairns for many
years. Thus was honour shown one
of the “big men” of the North whose
sojourn here has meant so much to
the development and progress of that
portion of the State.

from the town of Morven. Origin-
ally it formed part of the old
“Bureuda” Station, at a later
period being resumed, with other
blocks cut from the same big tract
of country, for purposes of closer
settlement. After the resumption,
a portion of the present “Allandaie, ”
was taken up by the Messrs. Allen
in 1909, the acreage of the new
station then being not more than
half of its present size. Shortly after
the acquisition of the “Burenda”
block, however, adjoining land was
secured by selection, and later, in
1914, Mr. J. D. Allen purchased the
‘‘Booka-Booka” lease to consolidate
the holding. The country consists
of well-grassed and park-like sweeps
of rolling downs, alternating with
mulga country, which has been
demonstrated by practical experience
as the safest kind of pastoral area to
venture upon “out west.” A good
body of grass is found on all parts
of the run, excellent feed for stock,
flourishing equally on the black-soil
country which prevails over about
half of the property, and upon the
sandy and light-red loams which
alternate over the other half. Hilly
portions occur here and there, these
being for the most part well
clothed with native timbers, which
afford good shelter for the stock.
Box, mulga, myall, and brigalow all
find a place on “Allandaie,” the
varying species of timber to the
initiated denoting the qualities of
the soil. When the run was first
taken up by the present owners no
improvement had been begun, and
the first business of the brothers was
to inaugurate a well-thought-out
system of development, which was
rigidly adhered to. The principal
drawback of the place was its
inadequate water supply, and this
being naturally regarded as a matter
of prior importance, immediate
measures were taken to secure
immunity from disastrous conse-
quences in the event of drought.
MR. J. D. ALLEN.
Suitable places for sub-artesian sink
ing were located, and every natural
facility taken full advantage of,
and at the time of writing
in . addition to the live bores,
which alone have a capacity sufficient
to supply the requirements of the
whole of the stock, there are four
large ground tanks on the property
—great excavations, capable of hold-
ing immense and practically per-
manent supplies of water. Windmills
of the latest and most approved
design are used to raise the water
from the bores, which average a
depth of about 460 ft., and in every
possible respect the arrangements in
this department leave little to be
desired in the way of completeness
and convenience. Close on 100 miles
of fencing mark progress in another
direction, the boundaries of the run
being rabbit-netted and dog-proof,
while the divisional fences forming
the 11 paddocks are threaded with
six plain wires. A modern homestead
was erected in 1914, with large, airy
rooms and wide verandahs, and in
its vicinity garden beds, shrubs, and
fruit trees add the finishing
touches to one of the most up-to-date
and picturesque station homesteads
in the western districts. The nearest
postal town is Augathella, 27 miles
distant, with which telephone com-
munication is established. Sheep

favoured, and the usual small herd
of cattle, with a few horses, are kept
for station use. In 1918 Messrs.
Allen Bros, purchased “Dungowan”
from Mr. W. A. Harding. This
property has an area of 40,000 acres,
with a carrying capacity of about
10,000 sheep. The water supply is
provided by three sub-artesian bores,
dams, and tanks located on different

Allen was not particularly blest
with the smiles of fortune, and at
the time of his death in the year
1871 his worldly possessions consisted.
At a later date he secured the con
tract for mails in the llunte
River district of New South Wales
which he carried out for some con
siderable time, and in 1884, comins


to the Maclntyre River country, was
the original selector on the New
South Wales side on the “Boobera”
run, near Goondiwindi. Starting in
a modest way, with mountains of
difficulty to scale, at the very outset
he met with an accident, breaking
his knee, which handicapped him
throughout the whole of his after
life. Despite this disability, and
the struggles he encountered through
drought, flood, and other agencies,
he bravely fought his way
until the time of his death, which
occurred as the result of another
accident in 1903. He left a large
in building up the proposition which
ultimately proved so successful. Of
the five sons and five daughters
resulting from this union, Miss
Elizabeth Allen devoted her services
to her country in its time of need,
and during the Great War was en-
gaged with the military hospitals in
the North of France, while Miss
Florence Allen did similar work
as a trained army nurse in Egypt.

cause of liberty and the national
ideals. The eldest son, Mr. James
Daniel Allen, was brought up
to pastoral pursuits and at the
age of 22, after his father’s
death, remained at home for a while
to watch over the interests of his
mother and the rest of the family.
In course of time, realizing that
there was not sufficient scope for
expansion on the home property, he
decided to go out west, where the
bigger areas at command afforded
almost limitless opportunities to men
of enterprise and initiative. For
some time he personally carried on the
management of “Allandale,” and
when this was established as a going
concern, resigned the reins to his
brother, Robert Mclntyre, who was
then a partner in the venture, but
whose interests have since been
bought out by the present pro-
prietors, and went to reside on a
property of his mother’s, adjoining
the old home, whence he controlled
his late father’s estate for some
years. In the beginning of 1915 he
returned to “Allandale," and has
since conducted this property, being
assisted by his partner, Mr. Daniel

the greater possibilities of a young
country, left London with his wife
and family, consisting of seven sons
and one daughter, in the sail-
ing ship “Light Brigade’’ for
Queensland, on December 3, 1871.
After a splendid voyage of 88 days—
a quick passage for those times—the
vessel landed her 321 souls at Rock-
hampton, on February 28, 1872.
Misfortune early attended the
family for the father passed away
but two months after hie arrival,
leaving Mrs. Parnell and her young
children to face the stern realities
of life in a strange land. To such
women as Mrs. Parnell the State
owes much of its splendid progress,
for their example has stimulated
effort and given strength of charac-
ter to the sturdy eons who have not
only conquered its vast spaces, but
made Australia’s name honoured
throughout the nations of the world.
Both the late Mr. Parnell and his
wife came of old and respected fami-
lies in the Motherland, and the good
education which Mrs. Parnell had
received prompted her to open a
small private school at St. Lawrence,
and thereby provide the means to
enable her to bring up her young
family. Realizing their responsibility
Mr. Donald Parnell and his elder
brother started out to look for work,
walking to Port Mackay, a distance
of 120 miles, where they obtained
employment at the Alexandra Mill,
the oldest sugar mill in the district.
Thus began a successful career dur-
ing which Mr. Parnell has been a
stock-rider, drover, mail contractor,
and engineer (for which he holds a
first class engine driver’s certificate),
has engaged in the butchering busi-
ness, farming, mining, and finally
became a prominent pastoralist. He
was in the big gold rush at Charters
Towers, in 1872, and helped to
build the first sugar mill, “Gair-
loch,” on the Herbert River. Later
he was employed in the construction
of a crushing mill on the Etheridge
goldfields. In 1881 he selected land
near Carmilla with the idea of grow-
ing sugar-cane, as Mr. Spiller, one
of the pioneers of the sugar industry
at Mackay, intended to erect a mill
at Scrubby Creek. However the
passing of the Anti-Kanaka Bill at
that time killed the project, and Mr.
Parnell tried growing maize, but the
price for this product fell to one shil-
ling per bushel and he was faced with
ruin, having to mortgage the selec-
tion and stock to meet the payment
of the instalments becoming due. In
the early nineties he was forced to
sell his stock to redeem the mortgage,
after which he packed his belongings
into a dray and started off for
Charters Towers where he erected a
sawmill. Whilst conducting this
business he completed arrangements
for the acquisition of a cyaniding

tablish other plants and purchase
the Fair Rosamond Mill and mining
properties at Millchester, eventually

and boys at the various works. Mr.
Parnell had every reason to be proud
of his achievement in connection
with mining for his cyaniding assay
laboratory and refining plants at


Millchester were recognized to be the
most up-to-date and complete in the
whole of the State. Having accumu-
lated considerable wealth from these
operations he returned to the old
selection which had been the scene of
his early endeavours, 18 years previ-
ously, and proceeded to purchase
many of the adjoining selections that
had been forsaken by the original
selectors and were then in the hands
of the banks, until he was soon hold-
ing an area of between 12,000 and
13,000 acres. The North Coast line
now runs through the property,
which lies between the range and the
sea, and comprises splendid agricul-
tural land, is well watered, heavily
timbered, and highly improved. The
cattle and horses for which “Eller-
slie” is noted are all of high class
imported stock, and the strain-is kept
the Million Club. He is a regular
supporter of Dr. Barnardo’s Homes,
and as an example of his big-hearted
generosity and practical sympathy
we are privileged in recording that
he has now offered to that wonderful
institution his old “Ellerslie” home-
stead and over 1,000 acres of free-
hold land together with all the
splendid improvements thereon, so
that they may use it as a depot in
Queensland for their boy and girl
immigrants to this State. He has
for many years been keenly inter-
ested in mining ventures, and at
present is director and holds an
eighth share in the Mount Coolon
Gold Mining Company near Charters
Towers. Of the surviving members
of the family the Hon. A. H. Par-
nell, J.P., of Brisbane, has an hon-
oured public career both in local
some time a member of the Aramac
Shire Council, and is at present a
member of the Central Division Pas-
toral Executive, and a director of the
Brisbane Gas Company. The young-
est brother, Mr. A. T. Parnell, J.P.,
owns “The Palms,” near Carmilla,
where he grows sugar-cane and speci-
alizes in the breeding of stock. He
is a member of the Broadsound Shire
Council. Being connected with the
pastoral industry and associated with
horses it is not strange that accidents
should occur, but rarely has such
misfortune attended a family as has
been the lot of the Parnells, for
three brothers, Ralph, Leonard and
Horace all met their death whilst
horse-riding. The only daughter,
Edith, married Mr. Elliott, of

up to standard by periodical impor-
tations of blood stock. The home-
stead is ideally situated and em-
braces all the comforts and conveni-
ences of the present-day station
home. In 1910 Mr. Donald Parnell,
in conjunction with his brother, the
Hon. A. H. Parnell, purchased
“Essex Downs” Station, near Rich-
mond. After more than 40 years in
his adopted country Mr. Parnell felt
the call of the Old World and
decided to take a holiday and revisit
the scenes of his youth. Accordingly
in 1913, with his elder brother, the
Hon. A. H. Parnell and his wife, he
toured England, Wales, Scotland,
Ireland, France, Switzerland, Ger-
many, Holland, and Belgium, pro-
ceeding by the Suez Canal route and
returning via South Africa. Mr.
Donald Parnell is a member of the
Royal Colonial Institute, the Em-
pire League, the Overseas Club, and
government affairs in the Rockhamp-
ton district and as a member
for many years of the State
Legislative Council. He was for
twelve years a member of the
Rockhampton Council, holding the
office of Mayor on three occasions,
was Chairman of the Kargoolnah
Shire Council, Blackall, the Living-
stone Shire Council, North Rock-
hampton, and a member of the Rock-
hampton Harbour Board. In 1908
he was called to the Legislative
Council and remained an honoured
member until the abolition in 1922,
receiving the King’s permission to
retain the title of Honourable,
granted to all members who had
served for ten years continuously.
Mr. E. G. Parnell, J.P., of Welling-
ton Point, is the owner of “Fortuna”
Station, Aramac, Queensland, and
part-owner of “May Downs” in
Western Australia. He was for
family of ten sturdy sons and
daughters to do credit to the State
of their birth. Looking back over the
many vicissitudes of fortune during
the past 50 years Mr. Donald Par-
nell is convinced that Queensland
offers infinite possibilities for the
man who wants to succeed and is
prepared to take whatever offers,
always striving with the idea of mak-
ing good. To quote his own words,
“I regard Queensland as one of the
finest countries in the world, but see-
ing that virgin country here costs
anything from £25 to £lOO per acre
to clear and bring to the state when
it becomes producing, I hold that
unimproved land, under certain con-
ditions, should be given as freehold
to all pioneers for the amount of the
survey fees. Every £1 in the pion-
eer s pocket when it becomes produc-
ing, is worth many times its value in
the Government Treasury.”


WILLIAM HENRY JOSEPH
KIRBY, “Bullindgie” Station,
Dirranbandi, is a native of New
South Wales, having been born near
Albury, in the Riverina district, on
MR. W. H. J. KIRBY.
February 23, 1877. He is the fourth
son of the late John Kirby, and re-
ceived his education primarily in the
place of his birth, afterwards attend-
ing a State school in the Golden
Valley district of Victoria, where he
assisting in the work of the properties
acquired by them in that district.
Here he remained until verging on
the completion of his twenty-first
year, when he joined his brother,
Mr. James S. Kirby, in partnership,
the two starting operations on their
own account on a property in the
vicinity of the parental estate, of
which, indeed, it previously had
formed a portion. The more serious
responsibilities which now had to be
shouldered by the young man proved
of considerable benefit to him, and
the experience gained in the connec-
tion referred to, together with the
advantage of being born and bred
to the calling upon which he was
now embarked in earnest, gave him
an excellent equipment for more ex-
tended enterprise of an independent
character. Upon the marriage of
the elder brother in 1904 a dissolu-
tion of partnership was agreed upon,
and the property was divided.
Thenceforward the gentleman under
review administered his own inter-
ests on independent lines, and in
1912, while still conducting the New
South Wales property, taking into
consideration the possibility of more
rapid advancement on an enlarged
area, he decided to make the experi-
ment of venturing across the Queens-
land border, there to inaugurate
operations on more extensive lines.
Accordingly he took up his present

land with an eye to the possibilities
of land settlement, and his inquiries
eventually brought him into the St.

portions of “Cubbie” Station had
been balloted for. He was fortunate
enough to secure at the ballot a

leases adjoining, the combined areas
running into over 220 square miles
of good grazing country. In earlier
days, at the outset of this partnership
account of drought conditions pre-
vailing at the time was unable to
occupy the land, and was compelled
to allow it to lapse. His acquaint-
ance with the country, however, had


inspired him with the utmost con-
fidence that under normal conditions
exoellent returns would repay the
pastoralist who should throw in his
lot in this district, and he after-
wards displayed this confidence in
the most practical manner upon his
return to Queensland by acquiring
his present property, which lies with-
in 5 miles of the block originally in

his possession. In its natural state
the country was abundantly clothed
with belar, box, sandalwood, pine,
coolibah, and mulga timbers, in
addition to a good deal of edible
scrub. Close on 20,000 acres of
the thickly-timbered area, however,
have been brought under the ring-
barkers’ axes, considerably altering
the general appearance of the
country. This work has been carried
out' under the most difficult of condi-
tions, as the greater proportion of
it was accomplished whilst the
(1913-14) drought conditions pre-
vailed, making it necessary to cart
water for the use of the men the

in progress, thus reviving the real

primitive times. Natural grasses
flourish in season, and the winter
herbage so invaluable for stock pur-
poses is also found in abundance.
When the property was first taken
up from the Crown by Mr. Kirby it
was practically in an undeveloped
state, the only sign of improvement
being that the sui'rounding settlers
had enclosed their own property, in
this way providing a boundary fence
for the future “Bullindgie.” Mr.
Kirby at the outset was confronted
with the pastoralist’s greatest diffi-
culty—want of water —a poorly-
supplied tank, which stood on that
part of the grazing farm which
foi'merly had been embraced in the
old “Cubbie” Station, and had been
resumed by the Government of the
day, providing the oxrly water
apart from the supply provided by
the bore, and as such add very con-
siderably to the value of the run.
Sinking for artesian water was com-
menced in the early part of 1915,
and the stream was struck at 3,057
feet, as a x’esult of which the “Bul-
lindgie” area has benefited by a
copious flow of over a million gallons
daily. The usual bore drains have
been excavated, by means of which
the water is earned to different parts
of the run, more than 20 miles of
these channels already having been
completed. When the whole of the
proposed system is completed it is
estimated that there will be over 80
miles of these drains on “Bullind-
gie,” forming a very efficient water
supply, both for stock and irriga-
tion purposes. Although Mr. Kirby
Kirby first came to the district in
1915 he erected a homestead on very
substantial lines, though with no
intention of using it as a residence
for more than a brief period. De-
spite the fact that the structure was
designed for temporary habitation
only, considerable care was taken in
its planning, and in every respect it
fulfils its purpose admirably, incon-
veniences which could be endured in
view of the fact that at no very
distant date it is expected to be
superseded by a building of a
superior type, being practically non-
existent. The permanent home of
the future was planned for at an
earlier date, but the prevailing
drought and war conditions making
the necessary materials practically
unprocurable, the erection has been
obtainable on the whole of the pro-
perty. His first efforts, therefore,
were directed to the overcoming of
this drawback, and accordingly ex-
cavations for five tanks were made
on different parts of the property at
an average cost of £2OO, the main
object of their construction being
the supply of water to the stock
until such time as a bore, which had
been arranged for in Mr. Kirby’s
calculations at the time that he took
over the property, could be sunk.
Unfortunately, however, before he
had attained a fair start the drought
of 1913 descended over the country,
and the tanks for the time being
were rendered useless, but they have
since justified their construction by
proving of considerable use as reser-
voirs of surface water, altogether

regards his property as being still in
the pioneer stages of development, a
large amount of improvement work
already stands to his credit. About
75,000 acres, divided into two pad-
docks, have been securely netted
against the inroads of marsupials,

provided with rabbit-proof netting.
The w r hole of the property is sub-
divided into nine paddocks, and a
further subdivision is now in course
of progress, Mr. Kirby intending to
confine his attention solely to the
raising of sheep. In this connection

the pastures of “Bullindgie” has
been built up with good flock ewes

time. The site upon which the home-
stead stands is 30 miles north-west
of Dirranbandi, the nearest point of
railway connection, and lies about
half-way between that centre and
the small township of Bollon. Mr.
Kirby has always manifested a live
concern in the general affairs of any
community with which for the time
he has formed a part-. At Collarene-
bri he was prominent in many charit-
able movements and organizations,
and as a committeeman of the local
hospital he did useful work for a
lengthy period. He was honorary
secretary of the committee of man-
agement of the affairs of the Roman
Catholic Church in that neighbour-
hood for many yeai’s, and it was
largely through his efforts that the


new edifice which was erected in
1906 was secured to the communion
to which for generations his family
has been devoted. At the present
time he is a member of the Balonne
Shire Council, and the circumstance

tance of 80 miles for the purpose of

trouble to which he is prepared to
go in the discharge of his public
duties. Mr. Kirby married in 1908
Edith Mary, daughter of the late
Thomas Carmody, who, himself a
native of Bathurst, New South
Wales, was tire son of an early
pioneer hailing from Ireland, who
settled in the Mother State, which
then was only in its infancy. Mrs.
Kirby’s fatlrer was associated with
the pastoral industry during the
whole of his life, and for many years
had full charge of the stock on the
old, historic cattle stations “Bun-
arba” and “Curragundi,” in the
Moree district. Of this union there
are two sons and two daughters
surviving.

ERNEST KERRISON HAR-
VEY, coachbuilder, Mapleton, was
born at Lowestoft, Suffolk, England,
and is a son of Mr. John Harvey,
a coal merchant and farmer of
Weston, in the same County, where
he shares a farm with several rela-
tives of the same name, and has won
considerable reputation as a breeder
of Berkshire and Yorkshire pigs,
winning champion prizes at various
shows in England. Air. John Har-
vey, whose father owned a fleet of
fisliing boats at Lowestoft and was
engaged in the herring fishery, mar-
ried Arabella, daughter of Air. John
Crickmore, of Norwich, also a sea-
faring man, and of the five sons and
two daughters of the union three
of the former fought for their country
in the recent Great War. One of
these, Sergeant-Alajor Thomas Edgar
Harvey, of the East Anglian Volun-
teer Artillery Territorials, was men-
tioned in despatches and recom-
mended for the V.C., while another
(Frederick Percy) was one of the
first to volunteer, having just com-
pleted nine years’ service in India
and retired from the Army when
war broke out. The third eon
(Albert George Gordon) followed the
example set by his brothers. The
subject of this notice, Mr. E. K.
Harvey, received his education at
the British Boys’ School, London
Road, Lowestoft, and having passed
the seventh standard examination
at the age of 12 left school and sub-
sequently served a five years’ ap-
prenticeship to the coachbuilding
and blacksmithing trades. Having a
leaning to military life, he decided
to join the army and enlisted with
the 9th Regiment of Foot, known as
the “Holy Boys,” stationed at Nor-
wich. After undergoing a course of
drill he applied for transfer to the
Woolwich Arsenal, where he started
work as a farrier in the artillery,
and later was with C Battery in
London at the time of the outbreak
of the Boer War. Proceeding with
the troops to South Africa in 1899
he was sent to the lower end of Cape
Colony, being attached to the 14th
Brigade, 7th Division, in charge of
Generals Chermside and Tucker,
under Lord Roberts. He had his
first taste of fire at Belmont, and
was afterwards engaged at Paarde-
burg, Kimberley, Johannesburg,
Pretoria, and Bloemfontein, being
present at the capture of Cronje at
Paardeburg, where he witnessed the
meeting of Lord Roberts with the
conquered general. Afterwards he
served for 18 months in guerilla war-
fare, and for his services received the
King’s and Queen’s medals, subse-
quent to which he joined the Orange
River Imperial Scouts as a farrier-
sergeant, and continued with this
corps until he obtained his discharge
just as peace was declared. Having
met with an accident whilst carrying
on the work of carpenter, he turned
to coachbuilding for a firm at Cape
Tcfwn, and worked out a new idea in
Cape fruit carts which attracted
some attention. Later, at Bulawayo,
he put in spare time in prospecting
for gold, and also indulged in the
shooting of big game in Rhodesia,
where he was engaged by an English
shooting party to take charge of the
native carriers, having acquired the
native tongue whilst moving round
the country. He next went to Lake
Tanganyika, in British Central
Africa, as mine carpenter on the
Northern Copper Works, and when
these closed down spent two seasons
at Sokoto Drift, on the Zambesi
River, eight miles above the Victoria
Falls, in Barotseland. In 1907 he
was contracting on Government
buildings in Bechuanaland and
various other places before pur-
chasing the Bellair Carriage Works,
in Natal, which he carried on for 18
months. Ultimately, on the repre-
sentation of Mr. G. P. Barber,
M.L.A. for Queensland, he em-
barked by the steamship “Salamis”
for Brisbane, and after arrival found
employment as a farrier, in connec-
tion with which he found his know-
ledge as a veterinary surgeon very
useful. In 1909 he started in busi-
ness for himself as a farrier and
blacksmith at Blackbutt, and after
moving to various centres finally
came to Mapleton, where he estab-
lished the first coachbuilding and
blacksmith’s shop in the district.
Mr. Harvey has also taken up land,
upon which he intends to settle at a
later period. As an exhibitor he
has been very successful, winning
prizes at the Nambour, Brookfield,
and Brisbane Exhibitions, and carry-
ing off as many as 13 awards at a
single show. He won special distinc-
tion for a “piano box” buggy at
Nambour, which was exclusively his
own work. Mr. Harvey married
Sarah Douglas, daughter of Mr.
Archibald Douglas, the pioneer of
Blackbutt, who arrived in Brisbane
some 35 years ago. It is interesting
to note that one of his sisters was
matron of Guy’s Hospital, London,
and an uncle, the late Harry Harvey,
who died but recently, was one
of the few survivors of the famous
Light Brigade in the Crimean War.
FRANCIS RICHMOND ROUSE,
“Noorindoo,” Surat, is a eon of the
late Richard Rouse, a descendant of
one of the earliest pastoral families
of the Mother State. Records show
that the original founder of this
branch of the Rouse connection came
to Australia by the sailing ship
“Nile,” in the year 1801, having
left his native home, Devonshire,
England, to assume the duties of
overseer of works in New South
Wales, on behalf of the Imperial
Government. He was accompanied
by his wife, and one of his children
was born at sea during the course of
the voyage. This progenitor of Mr.
Rouse continued to fill the official
position referred to at Port Jackson
until the time of his death, and
his descendants have since taken
their place amorg the history-
makers of New South Wales. The
late Richard Rouse may be said to
have been born into the pastoral
industry, and he became a well-
known figure among stock and sta-
tion owners of his day, the “Gunta-
wang” property, which only passed
out of the family in 1908, having
been in possession of the late gentle-
men as far back as 1825. He mar-
ried Miss Emily Barnard, a daugh-
ter of one of the oldest Government
officers in Tasmania, who occupied
the position of Government Printer
at Hobart for close on half a cen-
tury, and of this union there was
issue three sons and one daughter.
Mr. Francis Richmond Rouse was
born at “Rouse Hill,” Parramatta,
New South Wales, on January 20,
1869, and received his education at
All Saints’ College, Bathurst, where
he made a name for himself in the
field of athletics, and won renown
for his college by hie achievements in
the local world of sport. He shone
particularly on the cricket field,
and, while still in his early teens,
was the first chosen to keep wickets
against the English international
team, which visited Australia under
the captaincy of Mr. Alfred Shaw,
in 1883. Owing, however, to his
extreme youth, it was deemed inad-
visable that he should subject him-
self to the risk of so dangerous a
position, and he was forced to de-
cline the signal honour which had
been offered him. In the same year
he was awarded the Challenge Cup of


his college for scoring the major num-
ber of points in all branches of sport.
Upon leaving school at eighteen years
of age, he returned to his father’s
homestead, and during the following
four years devoted his attention to
mastering the various details asso-
ciated with pastoral enterprise, com-
mencing as jackaroo and working
through the whole gamut of station
affairs. In 1899, whilst conducting
the management of “Spicer’s Creek”
No. 2 Station, near Wellington, New
South Wales, on behalf of his par-
ent, he took a selection on his own
account, and worked it in conjunc-
tion with the other holding, con-
tinuing in this way for about five
years. He then disposed of all his
interests in the Mother State, and,
coming to Queensland, took up his
residence at “Noorindoo,” situated
in the neighbourhood of Surat, the
management of which had been of-
fered to him by his uncle, the
late A. A. Hangar. The property
at that time was held under the
title of Messrs. Hangar and Bell,
in which joint ownership it remained
until some two years later, when the
sole interest was acquired by the
former gentleman. Mr. Rouse com-
menced his duties on October 1,
1894, since which date he has con-
tinued to administer the affairs of
this well-known pastoral property,
and has met with much success in
the development of his principal’s
interests in that district. Huring
the period which has elapsed since
his arrival in Queensland, his name
has become familiar to almost every
pastoralist concerned in the wool and
mutton producing enterprise in the
Northern State, and he has earned
a deservedly high reputation as one
of the experts in his particular
branch of industry. Mr. Rouse is
also a landholder in his own right,
having availed himself of oppor-
tunities which have arisen from time
to time, to secure various valuable
freehold properties in addition to
some leasehold blocks, in the sur-
rounding district, which he uses for
grazing purposes. He is recognized
as one who takes a cordial interest
in the advancement of the general
weal, from the time of his advent
to Queensland, so far as the duties
of his position permitted, having
thrown himself whole-heartedly into
local public affairs. For the lengthy
period of over seventeen years he
occupied a seat on the Warroo Shire
Council, and, on one occasion, held
the office of chairman of that body
for three years continuously. He is
a Justice of the Peace, having been
gazetted to the Commission in
the late nineties by the Philp
MR. R. ROUSE.
Government. At the time of writing
he is chairman of the Surat Hospital
Committee, and takes a prominent
part in all local movements of a
patriotic or philanthropic character.
He finds his chief recreation in the
sporting field, wherein he is a pro-
minent figure, and the vivid orange
jacket and cap, widely known as his
colour, have caught the judge’s eye
in such important events as the
Stradbroke Handicap, the Brisbane
Thousand and the Carrington Stakes
(New South Wales), besides which
many of lesser importance have been
placed to his credit at various meet-
ings. Mr. Rouse races under the nom-
de-plume of “F. Barnard.” Among
the horses raced by him on his own
account may be mentioned “Hanny
Man,” “Merton,” and “Hart,” all
good performers, whilst he also held
an interest in “Malt Mark,”
“Oracle,” “Lolita,” and “Tedding-
ton.” “Teddington” achieved an
Australian record by winning four
races in a single day, at Roma,
Queensland. Mr. Rouse married in
1903, Maude, second daughter of Mr.
William S. Clendinning, for twenty-
seven years manager of the Too-
woomba branch of the Bank of
New South Wales, and prominently
known in banking circles for close
on half a century. Mr. and Mrs.
Rouse have a family of one son and
one daughter.
CHARLES WILLIAM LITTLE,
J.P., “Brooksby,” Lower Ocean
Street, Houble Bay, Sydney, was
born in Boston, Lincolnshire, Eng-
land, on July 22, 1846, and is a son
of the late John Caruthers Little,
then a well-known surgeon who was
engaged in the practise of his pro-
fession in the above-mentioned town.
The branch of the Little family to
which he owes his descent is an off-
shoot of the line which is represented
at the family seat of the Littles of
Pitchcombe, near Stroud, in Glou-
cester, in which County both the
paternal and the maternal ancestors
of the gentleman under review—the
Littles and Caruthers—resided on
their own estates and engaged in
professional callings during many
succeeding generations. Mr. C. W.
Little was one of nine brothers,
though the only member of the
family to seek his fortunes in the
land of the Southern Cross. Receiv-
ing a scholastic course at the Boston
Grammar School he left that institu-
tion when in his early teens and
proceeded to Canada, where he lived
with his paternal uncle for seven
years, having in the interval and at
the end of that period revisited his
native land, the latter occasion being
when he was but little past man’s
estate. After spending a short
time under the paternal rooftree,
acting on the advice of his father,
he decided to carve a career
for himself in Queensland —then
recently accorded her independence
as a separate Colony and holding out
bright prospects to young men
of intelligence, energy, and per-
severance who were willing to test the
possibilities of her wide acres —being
strengthened in his resolution by the
fact that a friend, Sir Maurice
O’Connell, one of the pioneer
pastoralists of the then Colony and a
distinguished figure in the military
and political history of the Contin-
ent, was already settled there and
willing to afford him such advice and
assistance as might be necessary.
Accordingly, leaving England in the
year 1869 by the "Young Australia,”
the young man started out on a
pastoral career that has occupied the
space of half a century, his first post
after arrival at his destination being
that of jackaroo on “Camboon,” a
pastoral property then owned by the
late James Reid. Here he obtained
his first insight into stock and station
work, gaining further experience of
the industry on “Logan Downs”


Station, where he subsequently
proceeded and which was at that
time in the hands of the late
C. C. McDonald, who also owned
“Cadarga,” and whose son, Falconer,
was a fellow-passenger of Mr. Little’s
on board the “Young Australia.”
Shortly after his advent thereto
“Logan Downs” was sold to Sir
Samuel Wilson and Mr. Donald S.
Wallace, who appointed him to the
post of overseer. Developmental
operations on systematic lines mark-
ing a new era in the industry at this
period, he energetically applied
himself to a similar work on this run,
which included fencing—the sheep
having been hitherto guarded by
shepherds—and other improvements.
Subsequently the property was
divided and the partnership between
Sir Samuel Wilson and Mr. D. S.
Wallace dissolved, the former gentle-
man taking as his share the portion
retaining its original name, and Mr.
Wallace the remainder, on which he
bestowed the designation of “Kil-
cummin.” Mr. Little was then given
the management of “Logan Downs,”
administering the area for eighteen
months, at the termination of which
period, being offered a partnership in
“Kilcummin” by Mr. Wallace, he
transferred his energies to that
property, where he was occupied with
the duties of managing partner for
some years, in the course of which
the first important development of
the industrv in the district was
effected under his administration. In
the year 1880 he took a trip to Eng-
land. and on his return decided to
dispose of his interests in
“Kilcummin” to Mr. Wallace, in
order to embark upon a venture of
greater importance. This was the
purchase of “Coreena” Station—in
the vicinity of which the town of
Longreach has since sprung up and
prospered—which was effected in
partnership with Mr. Wallace, Dr.
W. H. Syme, of Stawell, Victoria,
and the Union Mortgage Co. He was
engaged in the personal administra-
tion of “Coreena” until 1884, the
property and additional areas more
recently acquired being then formed
into a company concern of which he
became managing director. In the
same year he opened a business for
the company at Rockhampton, which
he conducted until 1892, this venture
being the parent of that well-known
institution, the Australian Estates
and Mortgage Co., Ltd. In 1892 he
accepted the position of sub-manager
of the Scottish Australian Investment
Co., at their Sydney offices, remain-
ing in their service for twenty years.
He retired in 1912, being then
appointed to a seat on the Dalgety
Board of Advice at Sydney. Mr.
CAPT. J. C. LITTLE, M.C.
Little sunk a considerable amount of
capital in the Mount Morgan gold
mines, these investments turning out
badly and necessitating the disposal
of the larger part of his interests in
the Coreena Pastoral Company, the
managing directorship of which he
still retains. Subsequently, however,
he purchased “Barenya” Station in
conjunction with Major Alex. Hay,
a member of the Hay family of Berry,
New South Wales, and is now
managing partner of that concern.
Apart from “Barenya” he has
interests in “Barfield” and “Claren
Park,” two grazing farms near
Augathella, which formerly were a
part of “Nive Downs” resumption,
and which are now under the manage-
ment of his third son, Arthur. He
married in the year 1884 Minnie
Mary, daughter of the late Mr.
Morgan, of Sydney, who, during
his lifetime, was well known in
commercial circles in the metropolis
of the Mother State. Of the union
there is a family of three sons and
three daughters. The eldest son,
Captain Charles C. Little, was
educated at Sherbourne, England.
Subsequently he selected “Barford,”
and was occupied with the conduct
of that property until the outbreak of
hostilities between the fighting forces
of Europe caused him to lay aside
matters of lesser import and attach
himself to the cause of his King and
country. Proceeding to England, he
obtained a commission in tbe Royal
Artillery, seeing active service and
winning his captaincy on the field.
Captain John Little, the second son,
actuated by motives which inspired
his brother and the flower of
Australian manhood to don the khaki
at the Empire’s need, became a
member of the Australian Light
Horse, joining up as a lieutenant.
He was afterwards transferred for
transport duty, and later he too won
his captaincy on the field, gaining
the added distinction of the Military
Cross for bravery in action. He
received his scholastic training at
Marlborough, England. Arthur, the
third son, was educated at the
Goulburn Grammar School, and at
time of writing is engaged in
tbe administration of “Barford” and
“Claren Park,” as already stated.
MONTAGUE BEAK, “Ulster
Park,” Moss Vale, New South
Wales, was born in Somersetshire,
England, in the year 1852, and is
a son of the late William Beak.
When quite a lad he was apprenticed
to a merchant in Bristol, where he
engaged in a round of duties that,
unrelieved by the prospect of
brighter conditions for the future,
were far from congenial to a tem-
perament essentially enterprising.
Better things, such as a moderate
competence and final independence,
seemed possible of attainment in the
far-off Continent of Australia, where
to his knowledge many men had
made good whose lives would have
been barren of achievement had they
remained at home, and hither Mr.
Beak was drawn when only sixteen
years of age by the promise of adven-
ture and prosperity which the young
land held out. Queensland was his
objective, and the year 1868 wit-
nessed his arrival in Brisbane. From
here he struck out in the direction
of pastoral life, in which he engaged
in various capacities, acquiring dur-
ing his early years in the country
a very thorough knowledge of the
industry in which he was later to
become so largely interested. His
first independent venture was made
in 1875, when he acquired a block of
country now comprised in his “Lake
Mary” holding. Here, he experi-
enced the usual “ups and downs”
which are the lot of the pastoralist,
overcoming obstacles which to many
would have seemed insurmountable,
enduring untold hardships and


accepting with fortitude the neces-
sity of continual sacrifice, until pros-
perity seemed on the point of
rewarding his efforts. As things
improved, “Sandringham” and
the Fitzroy and Mackay Rivers,
“Willangi,” near St. Lawrence,
“Salisbury Plains,” near Bowen,
and “Christmas Creek,” in the
vicinity of Charters Towers, were

itedness which, despite his many

enterprises. In addition to the
properties named above, Mr. Beak
has various landed interests in New
South Wales. Little need be said of
the courage, perseverance, and
Rockhampton district. Both the Liv-
ingstone and Broadsound shires have
benefited by his advice and experi-
ence when he was a member of their
councils, and sporting movements


received his whole-hearted support.

that he continues to hold a trustee-
ship in the interests of the
grasp, striking him severely on the
head. As hie doctor ordered a

eldest surviving son, MONTAGUE
CHARLES BEAK, is at time of
writing engaged in the management

vicinity of Mount Hedlow, a town-
ship in the Rockhampton district.
“Mount Hedlow” Station is the
Queensland headquarters of the com-
pany, which is playing a very impor-
tant part in respect to the pastoral
progress of the State. This old run
was taken up and named in the year
1860 by Edmund Atherton (whose
descendants to the fourth generation
are prominently known in the
Queensland pastoral world), the
township having been designated
from it. Mr. M. C. Beak married
Annette, daughter of John Clark, of
“Isla Park,” near Rockhampton,
and has two daughters. His brother
he was considered sufficiently com-
petent to take over the management
of the property, a work which oocu-
pied him for the five years preceding
his twenty-fourth birthday. About
the year 1915, he was transferred to
“Willangi” Station as manager, a
capacity in which he acted until
1917, when the company in which lie
is a shareholder purchased “Sails-
bury Plains” and placed him in
charge. He has since controlled this
fine Northern Queensland property,
which consists of between 500 and
600 square miles of typical coastal
pastoral lands situated between
Bowen and Ayr and devoted to
horse-breeding centre and has been
the home of fine sires, those now in
use being “Kenilworth” and “Cross-
leg” (a son of the famous
“Lochiel”). The Queensland Police
Service, which is noted for the
quality of its mounts, is regularly
supplied from this run, which bears
the enviable reputation of producing
the best horses in the district,

educated chiefly at a school at Mount

early age with the industry he now
represents, first assisting his father
and brothers at the home station,
and later, when in his early teens,
joining his late brother, John, at
“Prairie,” in the district outlying
Banana. In those years he was
much on the roads with stock of

since stood him in good stead. From

shorthorn and Devon cattle chiefly,
though the Black Polled Angus
breed has been introduced to the
pastures with a considerable degree
of success. Natural water in boun-
tiful quantities in the beds of the
Elliot River and several large creeks,
and artificial supplies from wells
equipped with up-to-date machinery,
ensure the run from the worst effects
of drought. The improvements in-
clude a very comfortable homestead
which occupies a site about 20 miles
north of Bowen. “Salisbury Plains”
is used chiefly as a breeding run,
stores being sent for fattening to
other properties owned by the com-
pany. It is well known as a
Lawrence district. “Willangi” is
one of the old-established holdings of
the coastal area lying between Rock-
hampton and Mackay, and occupies
country situated midway between
these two centres and within easy
distance of the recently completed
railway connecting them. Excep-
tional facilities for the transport of
stock are here afforded. The pro-
perty was formerly held by the
Christian family, who were among
the pioneers of this part of the
State. The youngest of the Beak
Brothers, MAURICE STEPHEN,
has charge of “Rookwood,” about
seventy miles from the Central
Queensland capital and within easy


distance of Marlborough, a township
on the Rockhampton-Mackay rail-
way route. “Rookwood,” like most
of the stations of the Beak Pastoral
Company is possessed of historical
associations, and like all of them,
has proved its value as a pastoral
proposition. The brothers all take
their part in the civil and sporting
affairs of the districts in which their
interests are centred and their
colours achieve considerable success
at local meetings. They have proved
worthy sons of their father, the
details of whose career tell of re-
markable achievement, for they are
incidents in the story of one, who,
when little more than a lad, strove
under the hardest conditions, amidst
strange faces and strange surround-
ings, and with no material assets,
towards eventual success, and has
succeeded far beyond the dreams of
most men, as the owner of vast
acres, big enterprises and the
founder of a race that will continue
to play its part in the history of the
country. Of the surviving daughters
of Mr. Montague Beak, sen., Sarah
Jane, Margaret Amelia, and Emma
Alary, the first-mentioned is married
to Air. Sylvester O’Sullivan and
resident in Clermont, Central
Queensland. Of the union there is
a family of two sons and a daughter.

tions past, have served their King
and country in various departments
of public activity, his grandfather
having been a coastguardsman in
the days of Napoleon, and lost his
life in the discharge of his duty;
while his grand-uncle served with
the British Army at Waterloo, un-
der the Duke of Wellington. His
father, at an early age, was appren-
ticed to a shipbuilding firm on the
Clyde, and, later, his inclination
turning towards sea-faring pursuits,
he joined the British Navy at a time
when the “wooden walls of Eng-
land” were the subject of song and
story, before steam had revolution-
ized the romance of the seas. The
late Mr. Nixon had an adventurous
early career in the Navy; and dis-
tinguished himself by boarding a
Spanish slave trader from the 18-
gun brig “Philidias” off the coast
of Africa, at a period when the
British showed themselves to be in
the van of progress and true civili-
zation by displaying a practical
antagonism to the traffic in human
life which was being carried on
wholesale in that part of the globe.
Leaving the Navy, Mr. Nixon for a
time joined the crew of an Amer-
ican whaler, and, eventually, after
arrival in Australia in the late
forties, was engaged in the survey
of the coast of Queensland by the
Admiralty. When the famous Ben-
digo gold rush occurred, the crew
of his ship deserted for the diggings,
and the captain and himself, being
helpless without men, took the op-
portunity to “follow the gleam”
themselves. Mr. Nixon found him-
self one of fortune’s favourites, not
only at Bendigo, but, subsequently,
in the Ovens district and at Ade-
long. He established the first hotel
at the latter place and conducted it
personally for some considerable
time. He was also the pioneer
hotelkeeper at Corowa, New South
Wales, his hostelry becoming the
centre of what afterwards developed
into one of the most successful
settlements in the Commonwealth.
The rise of Colambo Creek, now a
thriving railway town, is also' cred-
ited to his pioneering zeal, the first
selection in this district having been
taken up by Mr. Nixon; and here
he died, on April 25, 1875, leaving
an honoured name which is home
with jiride by his descendants in
the land of his adoption. The gen-
tleman under review, the present
Mr. Andrew William Nixon, leav-
ing Adelong with his parents during
his infancy, spent the greater part
of his boyhood on the banks of the
Murray River, and, eventually, was
apprenticed to the blacksmithing
trade at Corowa. At the conclusion
of his indentures, he proceeded to
Melbourne, where he spent nearly
three years in the trade, returning
to his old home at the time of his
father’s decease. Here he remained
until the affairs of the estate were
settled, and, marrying about this
date, he settled at Jerilderie, and
opened a blacksmithing business on
his own account at that centre. Mr.
Nixon was a resident of this place
at the time when the notorious Kelly
gang of bushrangers broke into the
local bank and robbed it of its
funds, and he took an active part
with his fellow-townsmen in endeav-
ouring to bring the outlaws to jus-
tice. He continued as a blacksmith
at Jerilderie until 1882, by which
time, desiring a wider scope for his
activity, he turned his gaze to- the
north, and, coming to Queensland,
took up contracting in the St.
George district—the present St.
George Bridge being a monument
to his skill. Having amassed suf-
ficient capital, by means of Govern-
ment contract work, he determined to
establish himself on a sound footing
and, previously having acquired
an interest in the Australian Steam
Sawmills, on the Balonne River he
purchased these mills outright, and,
for many years, devoted his atten-
tion to the conduct of his flourishing
enterprise. In the course of time,
as the supply of timber in the dis-
trict became reduced, and general
conditions were altered, the mills to
some extent experienced a natural
restriction of operations, and Mr.
Nixon relaxed his efforts in this
direction, though up to the present
day he retains the old mill,
which forms an interesting link with
the past. At the close of the nine-
teenth century, he began to direct
his energies to the pastoral industry,
and, being observant of the suc-
cess achieved by the princes of sheep
and cattle-raising enterprise, whose
operations stood as commercial land-
marks in the history of the district,
he decided that the land proposition
was the best avenue to prosperity
to which he could introduce his sons.
Accordingly he made his first selec-
tion of a block of 320 acres free-
hold, upon which he erected a home-
stead, and settled down with his
family to the development of this
small holding. His first efforts were
devoted to agriculture, and with
the assistance of his sons he put some
forty to fifty acres under the plough

what of a departure in a district

what was needed for home require-
ments had been reserved, finding a
ready market locally. Having
made a prosperous beginning, the
Nixon family next selected about
90,000 acres in the surrounding dis-
trict, the land taken up by them
originally forming portions of the
“Cypress Downs” and “Mona” Sta-
tions ; and upon this generous ter-
ritory the foundation was laid of
the pastoral enterprise which has
attained to such large proportions,
and which absorbs the full atten-
tion of Mr. Nixon and his sons at
the present day. The homestead —
known as “The Anchorage”—is
situated some six miles from St.
George, on the western bank of the
Balonne River, and is surrounded
by some 16,000 acres of land, this
being a portion of the whole area
of 90,000 acres, the greater part of
which is situated. near the township
of Bollon. The house is a very
modern, two-storied building, the
material used in its erection being
principally the cypress pine of the
George district, which was milled by
the Australian Steam Sawmills un-
der the personal supervision of Mr.
Nixon. The rooms —twelve in num-
ber- —are large, lofty, and well-
ventilated, every attention having
been paid to the important consid-
erations of health and comfort in
their design. The additional offices
and outhouses have also been
planned with a view to convenience
and fitness, each for the purpose to
which it is allotted ; and an attrac-
tive feature of the homestead area
is the surrounding plantation of
orange and other orchard trees,
and the flower garden, upon the lay-
ing out of which considerable time
and attention have been bestowed.
Mr. Nixon has always been distin-
guished for the active interest he
has taken in the public affairs of
the district in which he resides, and
he has occupied a prominent place
among those progressive spirits who
make the advancement of their own
particular corner of the country
their special and serious concern.
He served for some considerable
time on the Council of the Balonne
Shire, is a vice-president of the
Balonne Pastoral and Agricultural
Association, and for many years has
been a committeeman of the local
hospital. In his younger days he
was a recognised athlete, and, even
at the present time, displays that
excellent stamina which is an evi-
dence of good physical development
when the muscles were supple and
strong. He has always been a fine
wing shot, and still takes pride and
pleasure in displaying his skill in
this direction, upon which occasions
he is well able to hold his own with
the younger exponents of gun prac-
tice. Mr. Nixon married in 1878
Isabella Lehanna Buchanan, daugh-
ter of the late David Corkadale, of
Eaglehawk, near Bendigo, who was
numbered among the old pioneers
in the early days of Victoria where
he figured among the gold-diggers
who joined in the various “rushes”
of the early fifties, and was a well-
remembered personality for many
years after his death in that dis-
trict. Of this union there are three
sons and three daughters surviving.
The second son, Charles David,
joined the A.1.F., and had a fine
record of active service in France.
The other two sons, Andrew William
(eldest) and Marston Alma, were
also ambitious to serve their coun-
try, and presented themselves for
enlistment, but both were rejected
for some slight physical unfitness —
in the case of younger, resultant
upon a former gun accident—which
rendered them ineligible for accep-
tation by the military authorities.
ALBERT ERNEST SUDHOLZ,
“Ingaby,” Surat, is a son of Mr.
Frederic William Sudholz, a native
of Hanover, Germany, who left his
native land to settle in Australia in
the sixties. Alive to the advantages
offered by the freedom and wider
outlook of the British Colonies over-
seas, he became a pioneer settler of
South Australia, and, subsequently,
spent a brief period in Queensland,
during which the subject of this
memoir was born on November 22,
1883. At that time, Mr. Sudholz,
senior, was engaged in grazing pur-
suits on a holding in the vicinity
of Surat, but, eventually, he re-
turned to the South, and took up his
residence in Victoria, where he is
now living in partial retirement,
though he still retains an interest
in pastoral enterprise. He has placed
to his credit an excellent record as
a reliable and worthy pioneer, being
one of those to whom the business
of Empire-building could be safely
entrusted, and in whose hands the
honour of his country was secure.
Mr, Albert, Ernest Sudholz received
his education at Horsham, Victoria,
and, upon the conclusion of his
scholastic career, followed agrarian
pursuits in association with his
father, at a later date turning his
attention to mechanical engineering,
in which profession he served a four-
years’ apprenticeship. Having con-
cluded his indentures, he returned
MR. A. E. SUDHOLZ.
to his former occupation, and con-
tinued with his father whilst await-
ing a favourable opportunity to
strike out for himself. Perceiving
the possibility of more rapid ad-
vancement in Queensland, where the
liberal land laws gave the man of
industry and enterprise every en-
couragement, he decided to throw in
his lot in this State, and selected a
holding of some 4,000 acres at Ka-
toota, near St. George, which, after
three years, he sold to purchase his
present property. “Ingaby” com-
prises some 14,000 acres of good
grazing land, timbered with cooli-
bah, sandalwood, pine, box and
belar, and well clothed with a
variety of native grasses. It has a
frontage of two and a half miles to
the Balonne River, and is in every
respect admirably suited to the pur-
pose for which it is used by Mr.
Sudholz, whose vigorous measures of
development during the past few
years have greatly enhanced its
value as a stock-carrying area. Mr.
Sudholz, who resides on the prop-
erty and gives the whole of his time
and attention to its administration,
married in 1911 Florence Rosa,
daughter of the late Richard John
Underwood, of the well-known
“Warroo” Station, one of the oldest
pastoral properties of South-western
Queensland, and has a son and two
daughters.


ARTHUR HILL MURRAY,
L.R.C.5.1., L. & L.M., K.Q.C.P.1.,
medical practitioner, Cunnamulla,
and owner of “Nulbear” Station,
REV. J. E. MURRAY.
Western Queensland, was born at
Edenderry, King’s County, Ireland,
on July 27, 1859, and is the fourth
son of the late Rev. John Edward
five sons and one daughter, of whom
the eldest son was attached to the
Indian Civil Service, at the time of
his death holding the position of
Chief Inspector of Police at Assam,
Bengal. The second and youngest
sons entered the Church, and the
third, William Henry, for a time
followed the calling of a coffee
planter in Ceylon, subsequently re-
siding at Seattle, U.S.A., for 28
years, where he occupied a prominent
position in the malting industry,
and over an extended period filled
the office of Vice-Consul for Great
Britain at that place. The subject
of this notice, Dr. Arthur Hill
Murray, received his education at
the Kingstown School, Stackpooles,
and having decided upon medicine
as a career in due course graduated
from the Royal College of Surgeons
and College of Physicians, Ireland,
in the year 1880. His earliest
important experiences in medicine
and surgery were gained in various
leading hospitals, notably the Meath
Hospital, Dublin, and the National
Orthopaedic and Children’s Hos-
pitals in the same city. Among
honours gained by him were those
of first senior surgical prizeman,
Meath Hospital and County Dublin
Infirmary, prizeman and medalist in
time. Having decided to come to
Australia, upon arrival he took up
insurance work, chiefly for the pur-
pose of obtaining some knowledge of

appointment of House Surgeon in
Meath Hospital for some considerable
Hospital, situated at Cunnamulla,
which he has held ever since. Wdiilst
engaged in his professional duties in
this the centre of a big pastoral


district it was natural that his
attention should be turned towards
the industry as a profitable channel
for investment, and in 1914 he took
up a block of land with a view to
engaging in sheep-raising on his own
account. His earliest holding has

since been augmented to a consider-
able extent by the purchase of
further blocks, and he now owns in
the aggregate some 55,000 acres,
forming a valuable property, upon
which, in addition to the sheep,
both cattle and horses are grassed.
“Nulbear” is watered by an artesian
bore and by tanks of very large
capacity, which place the holding
practically beyond the fear of
drought, and in normal seasons the
pastures will easily carry 12,000
sheep. The flock is confined to
meriifos, a good type of animal being
produced. Dr. Murray takes a keen
interest in his enterprise, and con-
tinues the work of development as
opportunity permits, his professional
and public duties only being allowed
to have precedence to his attention
to the sheep station. Dr. Murray’s
term of residence at Cunnamulla
has now extended well over 30 years,
and during this lengthy period he
has become one of the best-known
personalities of the place. He takes
a leading part in all the various
organizations having as their object
the advancement of the district, and
for eight years in succession filled
the chair of the local Shire Council,
of which he has been a member for
over a decade. His efforts to promote
the health of the community are
of the most strenuous and self-
sacrificing order, and neither the
hottest sun of summer nor the coldest
night of winter are sufficient to deter
him from carrying out his duty in
this respect. The continual demands
on his time and his purse in the
cause of charity or patriotism are
met with liberal response, and in
another sphere of activity the
sporting field—he is also very promi-
nent. He has been president of the
local jockey club for many years,
and as honorary judge and starter
has done much to promote the
prestige of the course. At the
inception of racing in the district
no step was taken without his advice
and assistance, as hardly a committee
has been in existence in which
he has not held membership. Dr.
Murray married in 1885, Lydia
Elizabeth, daughter of the late
Andrew Williams, an identity who
was closely associated with land set-
tlement in the pioneer days of New
South Wales. Of the union there
are five sons and three daughters.
The four elder sons, viz., Charles
Hubert, Arthur William, Harry
Hill, and Frank Gerald, are all
engaged in the active administration
of their father’s pastoral interests at
"Nulbear, ” while the youngest, Guy
Lloyd, is a student at the Brisbane
Technical College in those depart-
ments which concern the work of the
pastoral industry.
SAMUEL ALEXANDER TAY-
LOR, J.P., "Bon Accord,” Dalby, is
the eldest son of the late John
Taylor, "Glen Alvon,” and was born
on an estate owned by his father on
the Macquarie River, New South
Wales, in the year 1858. Born at
Aird, Ireland, in 1834, the late John
Taylor, accompanied by his wife (to
whom he was married in Scotland)
arrived in Australia in 1857, landing
at Sydney. He subsequently became
a prominent figure in pastoral life,
owning many large properties in
various parts of the Mother State, it
being his practise to stock up and
then sell to the best advantage. He
had a family of four sons and
six daughters, one of the sons
(Hugh Corbett) who, at time of
writing, resides at his "Turanville”
Estate, Scone, New South Wales,
being now the owner of "Cullin-la-
ringo” Station, Central Queensland,
and part owner of “Katandra”
Station. As the eldest, Samuel
Alexander, approached to man-
hood, the late John Taylor placed
him in charge of “Wirrah” Station
on the Barwon River, and to provide
for the others purchased “Dobikin,”
near Narribri, “Glen Alvon,” near
Murrindi—which is still owned by
his third son, John —and “Toorable”
Estate, near Gunnedah, and actively
supervised the administration of all
these properties. In 1893, during
his connection with “Dobikin,” a
blizzard swept the surrounding
country and resulted in a loss of
200,000 sheep for the district,
“Dobikin” being depleted to the
number of 27,500. Sheep were
afterwards found packed three deep
in old dams and gullies, some of the
unfortunate animals being solidly
frozen, though many of those in the
second tier ultimately recovered, and
in one gully alone 900 odd were
saved after the top tier was removed.
The late John Taylor died at
Rothesay, Greenwich, in the year
1907. His eldest son, Mr. S. A.
Taylor, spent his boyhood at
“Zance” House—still one of the
well-known landmarks of Waverley,
New South Wales—his education
being conducted at Fort Street
School, Sydney. He concluded his
scholastic studies at the age of

sixteen, and proceeding to “Wirrah,”
entered upon the duties of manager
there, having under his control
20,000 sheep and 5,000 cattle. While
he was engaged in the conduct of
“Wirrah” the property was sold to
Mr. J. R. Lomax, and, as the result


of a visit of inspection paid by father
and son, “Kidgar” Station, a
property with a twenty-mile frontage
to the Castlereagh River, was
purchased from Mr. Thomas Fitz-

“Kidgar” adjoined “Euroka,” then
owned by Mr. F. Wolseley, brother
of Sir Garnet Wolseley, and the
inventor of the Wolseley shearing
machine. Mr. Taylor stocked
“Kidgar” with 3,000 head of cattle
In that year the rainfall record was
only six inches, the river drying up
for miles, while conditions became so
disastrous on “Kidgar” that it was
necessary to walk a distance of ten
miles to obtain drinking water, and
the stock horses had to be fed on
damper made out of flour costing £5
per bag, corn, oats, and chaff being
unprocurable there. The property
was sold to Amos Bros., railway
contractors of Sydney, in 1879, and
young Taylor then went to ‘‘Woolo-
broh,” a property of 72,000 acres,
containing thirteen paddocks and
shearing 20,000 sheep before his
advent as manager and part owner.
Under his control the number of
sheep put to the shears was
augmented by 40,000, and the
acreage of the property was extended,
the number of paddocks being
increased to thirty-six, while twenty-
seven large dams, taking over 80,000
cubic yards, were built to secure an
extra water supply. A bore,
producing a flow of 500,000 gallons
per day was sunk on “Woolobroh” by
a former Government of the then
Colony, and its output was consider-
ably increased during Mr. S. A.
Taylor’s regime. He remained on
“Woolobroh” for fifteen years, at
the end of which he disposed of his
interests to his brother, Mr. Hugh
Corbett Taylor, who had been
associated with him in the
administration of the property, and,
coming to Queensland, purchased
containing 70 square miles of
leasehold, 100 square miles of fixed
lease, and 30,000 acres of freehold on
the north and south sides of the

30,000 sheep and 3,000 well-bred
shorthorn cattle. In 1911 he sold
“Thorndale” and “Logie Plains”
to Messrs. W. and G. Hartnell


respectively, and in the following
year purchased “Bon Accord,” a
property comprising 24,274 acres of
freehold, from Mr. George Morris
Simpson, of “Stonehenge,” New
South AVales. He immediately
entered upon a policy of development
on this estate, which hitherto had
been neglected in regard to water
conservation, while the fences were
old and in bad repair; his system
resulting in the increase of the
number of wells from fourteen to
thirty-nine and the re-fencing of
every boundary and subdivision
except one, the fences being threaded
with eight wire
strands and some of
them netted, and
the paddocks fifty-
two in number.

England, and seven heifers and two
young bulls from Ireland, the most
valuable importations of their kind

among them may be singled out

a five-year-old his owner paid 300
guineas, and who has won many
prizes and championships. He is a

He died on March 25, 1877, at the
comparatively early age of forty-five
years, the cause of his death being
rupture of a blood-vessel, occasioned
by the lifting of a heavy weight.
By his wife—Mary Gleeson, of Ire-
land—Mr. Kennedy had a family of
five sons, two of whom are now
deceased, and six daughters still
surviving. Mr. Jeremiah Kennedy
was born at Fortitude Valley, Bris-
bane, in the year 1870, and came to
the district where he now resides
when a lad of eleven years. At the
conclusion of his education he be-
came engaged in droving, taking
charge of a mob of cattle, which he
successfully overlanded from “Per-
brook” Station, near Springsure, to
a place called Marsden, in New
South Wales, near the Victorian
border. After following this occu-
pation for some years he decided to
sail for Western Australia, but was
dissuaded from this step by a friend
who advised him to tender for the
contract for the line of coaches
carrying the mails between Cabool-
ture and Kilcoy. Mr. Kennedy was
successful in securing the contract,
and thereafter continued to run the
coaches on his own account for three
years, when he formed a partner-
ship with Mr. Hassell, who had

has proved of considerable benefit
to the district generally and gives
promise of still further extending


its operations. The mill has a
large output, the principal line of
manufacture being pine butter boxes
which are sold in large quantities
both at Brisbane and Sydney. Mr.
Kennedy identifies himself in a
practical manner with all the
organizations having for their object
the advancement of the district. He
was first elected to the old Caboolture
Shire Council about 1895, and occu-
pied the seat for six years. In 1901,
when Kilcoy was formed into a
separate Shire, he was returned as
a councillor and had the honour of
being elected chairman, holding office
for two successive terms. He still
a public man and citizen. We look
back on the commencement of your
life in Kilcoy some thirty years ago
and note that by dint of persever-
ance, together with business acumen,
you worked yourself into the position
of one of the leading citizens. Your
ability to handle public matters
resulted in your being elected repre-
sentative of the town and district on
the Caboolture Shire Council, and,
after a term of six years, and upon
the severance of Kilcoy from that
Shire, it speaks well for your popu-
larity that you were returned as
a councillor of the new Kilcoy
Shire, and were elected, by your
ceremony to welcome Sir William
McGregor on the arrival of the first
train to the town. To you and Mrs.
Kennedy, who has been your help-
mate in many of your social and
public undertakings, as well as to
your family, we extend our good
wishes, and trust that your future
may be happy and prosperous,
Signed on behalf of the residents of
Kilcoy and district.” (Here follow
thirteen signatures of leading resi-
dents.) Mr. Kennedy is a true lover
of a good horse, and takes a keen
interest in racing, being himself an
owner of some excellent performers,
including "Princess Bernie,” by
retains his seat on the Council, is a
committeeman of the local public
hospital, and gives cordial support to
every movement for the general weal.
A few years later Mr. Kennedy paid a
visit to the Old Country, and upon
the occasion of his departure from
Kilcoy was made the recipient of an
illuminated address from the towns-
people, worded as follows:—"Dear
Sir—On the eve of your departure
on an extended tour, we, the resi-
dents of Kilcoy and district, feel
that now is our opportunity to pre-
sent you with this slight token of
the regard in which you are held as

fellow-councillors for the first two
years in succession as its chairman.
Your great interest in all institutions
in Kilcoy which called for willing
hands is well known, and, to your
credit, these institutions are live
concerns to-day. Amongst them may
be specially mentioned the Kilcoy
Hospital; the Kilcoy Pastoral, Agri-
cultural, and Industrial Society,
and the Kilcoy Jockey Club. Your
tenacious advocacy of the extension
of the railway to Kilcoy bore good
fruit, and it was pleasing that you,
as chairman of the Kilcoy Council,
were privileged at the opening
‘ Little Bernie”; “Ballogie,” by
“Little Bernie'’; and “Venetian,”
by “Buckthorpe.” With “Venetian”
he won a Birthday Handicap and
several other important events, and
captured the St. Patrick’s Handicap
on two separate occasions through
the medium of “Princess Bernie”
and “Ballogie,” the latter carrying
the all-pink colours to'* victory in
1916. Mr. Kennedy married Mar-
garet, daughter of Mr. Michael
Kellehar, of Delaney’s Creek, a
pioneer who arrived in Queensland
in the sixties, and has a family of
three sons and one daughter.


ROBERT ARCHIBALD HAM-
ILTON, J.P., “Rockybar” Station,
near Hawkwood, was born in 1862
on the Darling Downs, Queensland,
and is the youngest son of the late
MR. R. HAMILTON.
Robert Hamilton, of “Calrossie”
Station, who came from Hadding-
ton, Banffshire, Scotland, in the
early fifties, his college career at
Edinburgh closing a youth spent in
the land of his fathers, to which,
after once leaving for Australia, he
never returned. Landing in Queens-
land, the late Mr. Hamilton en-
gaged himself as jackaroo to Mr.
James Ivory, of “Jinghi Jinghi”
Station, Darling Downs, where he
remained for a few years, gaining
an excellent experience, which fitted
him in 1863 to assume managerial
duties on “Auburn” Station, in the
Burnett district. At that time the
property was wholly devoted to
sheep, but the appearance of the
grass-seed and other troubles gradu-
ally caused the substitution of this
class of stock for cattle. Before this
era, however, Mr. Hamilton, after
six years as manager at “Auburn,”
had embarked on an independent
enterprise, purchasing “Calrossie”
in 1869. Here he was confronted
with the problem of reducing the
wild and untouched wilderness to
some state of order and civilization
in the face of many obstacles, not
the least of which were the hostility
and treacherous proclivities dis-
played by the aborigines upon this
intrusion into their happy hunting
grounds. As a first step towards the
accomplishment of his purpose, Mr.
Hamilton erected a homestead on
his new run, after which he intro-
duced the first flocks of sheep, these
having to be closely shepherded on
account of the depredations of
blackfellows and dingoes. It was
no uncommon thing at this early
period to see 500 natives gathered
together to engage in a corroboree,
and as their attitude was by no
means always friendly towards the
settlers the station-owners lived in
perpetual fear of the murder of their
shepherds by blacks who had turned
restive on their own or neighbouring
properties. Mr. Hamilton, however.
MR. R. A. HAMILTON.
from the first adopted a firm and
resolute manner of dealing with the
aboriginal, wdiich commanded re-
spect and saved him from much of
the annoyance and peril to which his
neighbours were subject. After the
timber had been thinned out on
“Calrossie,” and other improvement
work accomplished, he experienced
some encouragement in his proposi-
tion, although from season to season
conditions and values fluctuated, the
latter being, as a rule, compared
with present-day prices, absurdly low.
There was no sale for sheep as mut-
ton, the sole revenue being derived
from wool, the value of which varied
from 6d. to 9d. per lb., and any
surplus sheep were disposed of at
practically a nominal figure, a record
price once obtained by Mr. Hamil-
ton for a thousand fat wethers being
9s. per head, which was regarded as
splendid and excited great interest,
raising hopes that after all sheep
might be worth breeding to sell as
fats. In 1872 purchase was made by
the late gentleman of “Rockybar”
Station from Messrs. McFarlane and
Co., of Rockhampton, the area of
the property being about 150 square
miles. This haunt of the kangaroo
and blackman, like “Calrossie,” was
converted by Mr. Hamilton into a
sheep run, about 10,000 “woollies”
being grazed on the two stations.
It was still uphill work as regards
profits, the sheep of the day averag-
ing a clip of 6 lb., which at 6d. per
lb. gave annual revenue of 3s'. per
head gross, out of which all charges
and costs had to be paid and road
cartage of 200 miles to the nearest
markets. It was, however, a prin-
ciple of Mr. Hamilton’s never to
seek financial assistance outside, but
rather to depend entirely on what
he could make for development work
and other expenses, by adhesion to
which rule he avoided many of the
troubles incurred by other pas-
toralists, who availed themselves of
help from financial institutions. In
MR G. L. U. HAMILTON.
common with others he suffered from
droughts which, in 1874, severely
affected the whole of Queensland,
but by travelling his flocks about on
unoccupied country where a few


waterholes were found to be managed
to keep the sheep alive. In the
drought of 1886 conditions were
more difficult, as all the surrounding
country had been taken up, neces-
sitating long droving trips to secure
the necessary sustenance for the
stock, and for two years his sheep
were travelling round in search of
the grass which was lacking on his
own run. In the interval between
these two droughts—about the year
1877—cattle were introduced on the
run by Mr. Hamilton’s act in ex-
changing a beautiful draught horse
for six milking cows, which formed
the foundation of a herd of the long-
horned Durham breed. In 1887 the
discovery of gold at Eidsvold caused
a rush to the district, which resulted
in some increase in values, and
thenceforth prosperity crowned the
ventures of the fine old pioneer, whose
death eventually occurred in 1890 at
“Calrossie,” where he lies interred
with his wife. Mr. Robert Archibald
Hamilton—who was educated by a
private tutor at “Calrossie” home-
stead—being associated with stock
from his childhood on his father’s
station, naturally became an expert
sheep and cattle man at an early
period of his career. In 1889 he
assumed control of all the properties.

becoming general manager on behalf
of his parent, and under his regime
a solid course of improvement was
entered upon, much fencing being
erected and areas of country
ring-barked. The great flood of 1893,
which was the highest on record in
the Dawson and Burnett Rivers, had
hardly been recovered from by the
pastoralists when the big drought
of 1902 occurred, in which Mr.
Hamilton lost practically the whole
of his cattle. After the breaking of
the drought he mustered a pitiful 75
head out of 4,700 head of cattle, and
travelled them to “Spring Vale,”
a place he had purchased with all
the stock upon it, which was sup-
posed to number about 200 head,
but which when mustered only
tallied 50. With the 125 cattle thus
remaining out of two herds he con-
tinued breeding, and within a
few years had fully restocked

“Rockybar.” This property derives
its name from a bar of granite which
crosses the bed of the Auburn River
immediately at the rear of the home-
stead, forming a fine natural barrier
and damming back the waters for
over half a mile upstream. Dispos-
ing of “Calrossie,” Mr. Hamilton
purchased other property, and now
controls 200 square miles of well-
developed pastoral land, capable of
running an approximate number of
5,000 head of cattle. The country
composing the “Rockybar” Estate
is mostly of granite formation, being
timbered with ironbark on the ridges
and spotted gum and wattle under-
growth on the flats. The property is
watered by the Auburn River and
its tributaries. Mr. Hamilton takes
a keen interest in the public affairs
of the district, and is well versed in
matters of shire administration,
being a member of the local council.
MR. M. A. W. HAMILTON.
He holds the Commission of the
Peace, having been gazetted to that
office by the Philp Cabinet. He was
an active member of the local War
Council, and was instrumental with
other residents of the district in
promoting a special fund to be de-
voted to the repatriation of returned
soldiers, £l5O being collected in the
first year, which amount has been
distributed among those eligible in
the Auburn Shire. In 1890 Mr.
Hamilton was married to Lydia
Caroline, daughter of the late
George Donald, of “Spring Mea-
dows,” Darling Downs, of which
union there is a family of four sons
and three daughters, the sons—ail
six-footers—proving of great assist-
ance to their lather in the working
of the property. Two of these fine
young Queenslanders, George and
Cla renoe, offered their services to
the A.1.F., the latter being accepted
and served his country nobly at the
front. George suffered the disap-
jxhntment of rejection on account of
heart weakness, but undaunted sub-
sequently offered to provide and equip
an ambulance car if he should be
allowed to act as driver, an offer
which was reluctantly declined by
the military authorities.


Councillor JOHN GRIGOR,
grazier, etc., Wootha, via Maleny,
ie a son of the late William Grigor,
who was born in the North of
Scotland, where hie people for
generations before him had followed
farming pursuits at Elgin, in Moray-
shire. In the year 1853, at 22
years of age, he left his native land
by the sailing vessel, “William
Miles,” and after a three months’
trip arrived at Moreton Bay, Queens-
land, in January of the following
year. After landing in the infant
city of Brisbane, whither he was
conveyed by means of a lighter from
the bay, he looked round for employ-
ment, and eventually engaged him-
self for six months to the late Wil-
liam Bulcock, of “Eagle” Farm,
and the late lion. William Petti-
grew, at Yandina, in the timber-
getting industry, the firm running a
small schooner which was especially
installed with engines for facilitat-
ing the transport of logs onMaroochy
Inlet. Mr. Grigor undertook the
management of the timber cutters,
who numbered about 30 men, half
a dozen bullock teams being found
necessary to cope with the large
output of timber handled by the
partners. The financial depression
which occurred in 1866 affected the
firm very seriously, and the partner-
ship was dissolved, subsequent to
which the gentleman under review
found his way to Mount Buderim, in
which district he was practically the
first white man. He settled here
issue three sons and seven daughters,
Mr. John Grigor, the subject of this
notice, was the first white male child
born at Mooloolah, and subsequently
coming south, attended a school at
Pinkenba for a time. He finished
his education at Caboolture, and
leaving school at the age of 14,
began to work on his father’s farm,
at 16 being entrusted with the
driving of a bullock team. He con-
tinued operations on his father’s
behalf for many years in the
Blackall Ranges, where eventually
he selected some 320 acres, and was
the first to plant citrus fruits in the
district, which he considers good
country for fruit-growing. W hilst
clearing his block of timber he
formed a 10-acre orchard, and as
with whom he remained for double
the period of his engagement. Being
on the look-out opportunity
to better his position, he joined
forces with a partner named Cham-
kers in pit-sawing and shingle-split-
ting at Moggil, & and having con-
tinued successfully in this connection
for some considerable time, began
timber-getting on his own account
in the 5 same district. Later he
removed to Pine River, where cedar
was plentiful in those early days
before the country, even round about
Bald Hills had been thrown open
for selection and from here went to
Burpenga’ w h e re he still followed
the occupation of timber-getting.
His next enterprise was to enter
into partnership with Messrs. Lowe

with his young wife for a time,
building a house at Mooloolah, and
whilst continuing in the timber
industry, selected about 160 acres of
land in the Glass House Mountains,
which he cleared and fenced for
farming purposes. This district
became a busy place at the time of
the gold rush to the newly-opened
Gympie field, being on the coach
route taken by Messrs. Cobb & Co.,
and a stopping-place for the chang-
ing of horses occurring in the
vicinity of Mr. Grigor’s selection,
he has seen hundreds of men camp-
ing there at one time. Mr. Grigor
died in 1907 at the age of 76. By
his wife, Mary, daughter of the
late John Fenwick, of Scotland, his
shipmate on the voyage out, he had
he was able further to develop the
holding, started dairying with con-
siderable success. About 1903 the
question of inaugurating a local
butter factory was taken into con-
sideration at Maleny, and Mr.
Grigor was well to the fore in the
formation of a company to start
operations. He was one of the
foundation shareholders, and has
gradually increased his initial 25
shares to the maximum limit of 100,
and for the first three years of the
factory’s existence undertook the
carting of the butter by means of
his bullock team to Landsborough,
upon the return trip bringing goods
for the co-operative store, which
meanwhile had also had its inception
in the settlement. Recently Mr.


Grigor selected another 160 acres
situated about two and a half miles
from hie first holding, which he is
now clearing for grazing purposes,
and from this block he secured
splendid timber for the erection of
his present handsome residence, to
which he has given the name of
“Kildera.” He also owns a large
area of ground at Conandale, com-
prising 2,000 acres, which is fenced
and subdivided into four large pad-
docks, and is used by Mr. Grigor ae
pasture land for the fattening of
store cattle, and also as a breeding
station, his herd consisting of
about 300 cattle. He was first
appointed a Justice of the Peace
during the reign of her late Majesty
Queen Victoria, and has since been
sworn in twice—upon the accession
of King Edward VII. and King
George V. respectively. In matters
of purely local interest, besides being
a director of the butter factory
above mentioned, he occupies a seat
on the School Board, and he is also
a trustee of the School of Arts at
Peach erston, of which his father and
Messrs. Coyle and Page were the
founders. Mr. Grigor married Eliza-
beth, daughter of the late Joseph
McCarthy, of Wootha, and has a
family of four sons and one daugh-
ter. He is a trustee for his father-
in-law’s estate at Wootha, which has
some historic interest from the fact
that the eminent meteorologist,
Clement Wragge, erected there one
of his stations of observation. Mr.
Grigor’s two eldest sons assist their
father in the management of his
various interests, and the younger
ones are completing their education.
RICHARD CHARLES BOW-
MAN, “Willowdale,” Kin Kin, via
Cooran, was born in the town of
Braidwood, New South Wales, in
1862, and is the second son of the
late Richard Bowman, one of the
pioneers in the farming industry of
that State. He received his early
education at Aralaun, and after
leaving school continued for a while
on the home farm, assisting his
father in the various departments
of activity inaugurated by that
gentleman. Later he secured for
himself a wider experience by fol-
lowing other occupations on the land
and eventually joined the Bodalla
Dairy Company, where he was en-
trusted with the care of the stock,
and retained this position for seven
and a half years. In 1898 Mr. Bow-
man found his way to the Northern
Rivers country of New South Wales
and engaged in the dairy industry
I here for about seven years. Having
heard of the splendid possibilities of
the rich Kin Kin scrub lands, he

decided to try his fortune in
Queensland, whither he made his
advent in 1905, being one of the
first of the New South Wales farm-
ers who disposed of their holdings
in the Mother State for the purpose
MR. V. A. BOWMAN.
of starting afresh in a district which
held out such golden allurement to
those men of enterprise and industry
who were prepared to pay the price
of success. Mr. Bowman’s choice fell
upon an area of 240 acres of virgin
land which, in the first instance,
entailed an immense amount of
labour in the matter of clearing and
fencing before stock could be placed
upon it and dairying operations be-
gun. This accomplished, work along
the lines intended commenced in
earnest, the many hardships at-
tendant upon the carrying on of
the industry failing to deter the
plucky pioneer from pursuing his
original design. In the early stages
the cream had to be packed on
horseback and conveyed over un-
made roads to the nearest railway
station, and all other procedure in
connection with the proposition was
in keeping with this primitive means
of transport. Gradually, however,
conditions improved and prosperity
became assured, and as this happier
state of things advanced modern
improvements began to find their
way on to the farm, which in
natural advantages left little to be
desired for dairying purposes. A
windmill was erected which pumped
an unfailing supjfiy of pure, fresh
water from a permanently-flowing
creek; milking machines were intro-
duced, and these, four in number,
are worked by means of a modern
oil engine, which has proved a great
success. At the present time the
property comprises one of the most
important features of the expanding
butter industry of Queensland, and
the fine dairy herd of Illawarra
shorthorns commands universal ad-
miration. Mr. Bowman is the for-
tunate owner of the unbeaten
champion cow, “Flower,” for which
he was awarded a handsome silver
bowl for first and grand champion
prizes at the Brisbane National Ex-
hibition of 1913, in addition to win-
ning many other first awards at
agricultural shows at Gympie and
Pomona. He takes a practical interest
in all that concerns the welfare of
the district in which he resides, and
besides being an active supporter of
all patriotic movements is a member
of the Public School Committee, a
founder and very prominent worker
of the Kin Kin School of Arts, and
a member of the Noosa Agricul-
tural, Horticultural, and Industrial
Society. He married in 1885 Annie,
daughter of the late William Whe-
lan, a well-known farmer of the
Braidwood district, New South
V ales, and has three sons and a
daughter. His younger son, Vincent
Ambrose Bowman was born at
Bodalla in 1894. He served abroad
with the A.I.F. during the Great
War.


DAVID WATSON, “Montrose,”
Bundaberg, was born in the parish
of Guthrie, Forfarshire, Scotland,
in the year 1839, and is a son of
the late Travers Watson, of that
MB. D. WATSON.
neighbourhood, who farmed his own
property, known as “Kirton,” where
the subject of this memoir spent his
early days. David Watson received
his education at the village school
near the place of his birth, and at
the close of his schooldays remained
'under his father’s rooftree, assisting
in the varied duties of the farm for
a number of years. In 1860 he
undertook the responsibility of
working an agricultural holding on
his father’s behalf at Blackall, about
12 miles distant from Montrose,
and continued there for four years.
At the close of this period his health
became seriously affected, and for
the purpose of recuperating he went
to Dublin, Ireland, where he was
associated with his brother-in-law,
Walter Brown, principal of the
flour-milling firm of Walter Brown
and Co., and incidentally found
some employment in the mills. In
1866 the Fenian outbreak occurred,
and Mr. Watson distinctly recalls
being at Dublin Castle when waggon-
loads of the pikes used by the rioters
were brought into the grounds. On
account of the energy and prompt
action of the authorities, who were
anticipating active assault by the
Fenians, the outbreak was very
quickly suppressed, and few heads
were broken. In 1867 Mr. Watson
left Dublin for Australia, mak-
ing the voyage in a small brig
called “The Coonatta,” of 300 tons
burden, under the command of
Captain Begg, which landed her
passengers at Adelaide after an
uneventful trip of three months’
duration, a small barque which left
the same wharf in Ireland on the
same day as “The Coonatta” having
arrived at the South Australian port
precisely seven hours earlier than the
brig, which was regarded as an in-
teresting coincidence. Mr. Watson’s
first act in Adelaide was to attend
a meeting of unemployed workers
held in the Town Hall, which he
admitted had a rather depressing
effect on his enthusiasm in having at
last reached what was regarded in
the Old Country as a veritable “land
of promise,” but this natural feel-
ing of reaction fortunately in his
own case was counteracted by the
fact that before leaving the Old
Country he had secured a position
with the well-known firm of that
period, known as Whyte, Counsell,
and Co., merchants, of Adelaide
and was able to enter upon his
duties without any loss of time.
Four months later the tidings of the
discovery of gold at Gympie, Queens-
land, was noised abroad, and Mr.
Watson, unable to resist the lure,
resigned his position, and with
thousands of others found his way
to the field, where he was eager to
try his luck as a miner. Fortune,
however, withheld her smile on this
venture, and in the same year (1868)
he abandoned his claim, and pro-
ceeding to Maryborough, took up a
selection of 80 acres of land on the
Frankshire Road, near the river,
which he developed as an agricul-
tural and dairy farm with consider
able success. As prosperity attended
his efforts he acquired a good team
of horses, and started in the carry-
ing line of business, conveying the
produce from neighbouring farms
between the centres of Mount Perry
and Maryborough. In 1871 he re-
linquished carrying, and accepted
an offer to take charge of the horses
employed in connection with the
Irrawarra sugar mills, under a Mr.
Nixon, in which capacity he re-
mained at the mills for about nine
months. From there be entered the
employ of a farmer in the Bunda-
berg district, and about 1875 joined
Mr. William Davidson, who was
residing on a property owned by
Messrs. Dunn & Farquhar, who had
employed him to hold the land
whilst giving him the opportunity to
use it as he chose on his own account.
The new partnership went to work
with a will to make a success of its
proposition, and securing the ser-
vices of ten kanakas, they planted a
considerable area with maize, which
proved a profitable venture. This
evidence of the go-ahead qualities of
Messrs. Davidson and Watson led
the owners of the holding to employ
them in the development of a cer-
tain area, of which they proposed to
retain the profits themselves, re-
warding their representatives each
with 100 acres of land in recognition
of their valuable services. After
clearing 100 acres and planting it
with maize for Messrs. Dunn and
Farquhar, Mr. Watson and his
partner became ready supporters of
the sugar-growing scheme which was
then attaining such prominence
among landowners in suitable lati-
tudes. Putting their theories on
this matter into practice, they
accomplished the clearing of 500
acres, and planted it with cane,
under contract at £ll per acre—a
piece of work which took two years
to accomplish, and upon the comple-
tion of which, about 1878, they dis-
solved partnership. Mr. Watson
next took in hand the improvement
MR. E. D. WATSON.
of his own 100-acre block, and hav-
ing cleared the ground, he planted
40 acres with sugar-cane. The local
mill, however, was already over-
supplied, and his little plantation


had to wait for four years before the
cane could be cut and any return for
his labour obtained. When the Mil-
laquin Mill got going properly, how-
ever, this obstacle was removed, and
right on from 1882 Mr. Watson’s
prosperity as a sugar grower steadily
advanced. He became one of the
originators of the North Isis Cen-
tral Mill, in the first instance acting
as one of the provisional directors,
and after the formation of the com-
pany being appointed to the direc-
torate. This mill has the distinction
of being among the few concerns of
its kind which have fulfilled all their
engagements to the Government in a
financial sense. Mr. Watson ex-
presses the highest opinion of
kanaka labour for the opening up
of the tropical areas of Queensland,
and contends that the splendid work
that was achieved in the earlier
period of sugar production in this
State is rapidly being undone by the
inability of the white man to work
under the trying conditions of the
canefields at a reasonable wage. He
has witnessed many vicissitudes in
the cane-growing industry, and holds
that the employment of coloured
labour is the only solution of the
difficulty which, at the present
time is proving so serious a prob-
lem to the growers. Mr. Watson
retired from active life in 1910,
and has since lived in semi-retire-
ment at his home, “Montrose,”
Bundaberg. He has taken his share
of responsibility in the public organ-
izations of the district, and has served
as councillor of Woongarra Shire,
being elected chairman of the Coun-
cil for a term. In the early days of
the establishment of a divisional
board in the district, he was one of
the first loardsmen appointed by Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith, but resigned
this office shortly afterwards upon
the occasion of his departure for a
trip to Scotland in 1886, when he
revisited the scenes of his early days,
and had the joy of a temporary re-
union with his parents, both of
whom were then surviving. Mr.
Watson married in 1870 Jessie
Brown, of Edinburgh, Scotland, of
which union there was issue two
children. After the decease of this
lady in 1873 he remained a widower
for nine years, in 1882 taking to wife
Maria, daughter of the late James
Julin, of Maryborough, the latter
being one of the first immigrants to
reach the Wide Bay district of
Queensland direct from the Old
Country over fifty years ago, by the
vessel “Ariadne.” Mr. Watson’s
youngest son, Eric Douglas Watson,
in 1915 enlisted in the Australian
Imperial Force, and served his
country in Egypt and France.
WILLIAM ALBERT BLYER
WATT, proprietor of the Buderim
Hospice, Mount Buderim, is a son
of Mr. James Watt, who was born
at Greenock, Scotland, in 1841, and
coming as a young man to Queens-
land, became engaged in the farm-
ing industry in the Ipswich district,
where the gentleman under review
was born on July 7, 1880. There
were but few educational facilities
in those early days, and young Watt
at seven years of age began to work
for his living as a “boy” on a farm
owned by Mr. William Baxter, at
Baxter Creek. After six months in
this connection he was sent to
Northbrook Creek, and assisted on
the dairy farm of Mr. Duncan
Stewart for five years, at the close
pf which period he was placed by
his father in a biscuit factory at
Brisbane. The work here not prov-
ing congenial, after three weeks he
took upon himself to sever his asso-
ciation with the factory, and having
set his heart on outdoor work, left
home at twelve years of age, and
walking twelve miles to Cobble Creek,
obtained employment with a Mr. T.
Bryan, who remunerated him at the
rate of 2s. 6d. a week and his keep.
This continued for eighteen months,
when with sixpence in his pocket he
went to Bundaberg, and took a posi-
tion in Mr. W. Darlington’s aerated
water factory at 12s. as his weekly
wage. A year later he com-
menced cane-cutting for various
growers and having spent a couple
of seasons with Mr. Scott of Albion
Vale Sugar Mill, on the Burnett
River, returned to his parents, and
started mining pursuits with his
father on the auriferous country
surrounding Childers. After six
months of fruitless prospecting he
returned to cane-cutting at Nam-
bour, and for the three following
years was employed by Mr. Mitchell,
on the canefields and sawmill in that
district. He also picked up some
knowledge of carpentering from the
same gentleman, and at twenty-one
years of age started contracting on
his own account at Gympie, where he
remained for about twelve years.
During this period with commend-
able industry he gave a great deal
of time to evening study, after his
day’s work sitting down to books and
figures, in this way doing much
toward supplying the lack of early
education. In 1914 Mr. Watt
undertook the erection of a house at
Mount Buderim for Mr. 11. B.
Fielding, the well-known orchardist
and landowner, and whilst so
engaged he was impressed with the
idea that there was an excellent open-
ing for a hospice or coffee palace at
that centre. Accordingly, purchas-
ing a block of land of about 60
acres, he built to his own design a
house of 25 rooms, the completed plan
allowing for extension to 50 rooms as
soon as sufficient encouragement for
the larger building should be given
by the public. The hospice is situated
on the top of the hill, with a splen-
did outlook over the surrounding
country, including views of the
Mullolla and Maroochy Rivers, with
numerous motor boats plying up and
down these waters. The house,
which is two storeys in height, is
divided into suites of apartments,
and at the present time is capable
of accommodating about 40 visitors.
Wide verandahs to the north and
east provide ideal lounging places in
the marvellous climate which pre-
serves a wonderfully even tempera-
ture. The interior is well lighted
and ventilated, with large, lofty
rooms and modern appointments,
including hot and cold baths, and
air-gas lighting system, which are
found throughout. Home - grown
poultry, vegetables, and fruit add to
the attraction of a first-class table,
which is also supplied with milk and
cream from Mr. Watt’s own dairy.
For recreation purposes there is a
tennis court in. connection with the
hospice, which also has its motor
boat on the Mullolla River for the
use of visitors, while a vehicle is
kept for hire, trips to the Malcolm
River being one of the favourite
excursions afforded by the district.
The hospice under the capable man-
agement of Mr. and Mrs. Watt is
already becoming very widely
known, and visitors from all parts
of the Commonwealth and New
Zealand are finding their way to the
spot. Mr. Watt married Rebecca
Jane, daughter of Mr. James Jack-
lin, of Ipswich, and has two sons and
one daughter.


THOMAS BEHAN, “Garfield,”
Jericho, and of “Bilbah Downs,”
Emmet, was born near Kilrush,
County Clare, Ireland, in July,
1864, and is a son of the late
Michael Behan, a member of a very
ancient Irish family, the line having
been identified through many gener-
ations with maritime avocations.
The late gentleman, following in the
footsteps of his progenitors, pursued
the calling of a pilot on the Shannon
River for the greater portion of his
life and was fifty years of age when
he bade farewell to his native Isle
and sailed for the land of the
Southern Cross. He arrived in
Queensland with his wife and infant
son in the year 1865, and relinquish-
ing the sea as a means of livelihood
settled in Ipswich and devoted the
remainder of his life to landed
occupations, his interests being
chiefly in connection with cattle.
Mr. Thomas Behan received the
rudiments of his education at the
local Catholic School at Ipswich,
and later attended the Ipswich
Grammar School, terminating his
studies at that academy at the age
of sixteen, when he entered the
Railways Department as a cadet.
While thus engaged he took up the
study of surveying and civil engin-
eering, securing his certificate as a
surveyor for mines, lands, rivers and
harbours when in his twentieth year.
He practiced his profession in all for
about thirty years during which
time he was chiefly connected with
the Lands Department, and was
the principal surveyor of Northern
Queensland for a lengthy period, in
the course of his work exploring and
surveying the hinterland of the
district outlying Cairns, in which
locality he spent some sixteen years.
Here his energies were not merely
confined to his profession but were
actively concerned with agricultural
(such as rice and coffee growing, an
industry of which he was the
pioneer) and other phases of devel-
opment. His efforts as one of the pro-
moters of the Cairns-Herberton rail-
way line claim recognition as well as
the fact that he is the author of all
the original surveys of the town and
district, and the engineer of the
original waterworks scheme. During
1893-4 he was occupied with the
survey of mines in Croydon, and
from that centre he came west,
where he took up his duties as
Government surveyor in 1895, his
district extending from Emerald to
the South Australian border and as
DDD
far north and south as Cloncurry
and Windorah, all the grazing farms
in that area having been surveyed
under his direction. In the mean-
time he purchased his present hold-
ing, “Garfield,” from the original
ME. T. BEHAN.
owner, the late H. Bushell, who had
stocked the place with a nucleus of
400 sheep procured from “Amby
Downs.” On relinquishing his pro-
fessional duties lie devoted himself
to the development of this property,
which consists of 110,000 acres,
comprising grazing farms and pas-
toral leasehold lands, the area being
devoted principally to sheep, though
cattle and horses are also carried.
For a period Mr. Behan experi-
mented with ostriches, which he
imported from South Australia, but
owing to lack of facilities for treat-
ing the feathers for commercial
purposes he abandoned the industry,
giving the birds their freedom,
numbers of them being still at large
in the surrounding bush. In develop-
ing the property his experience in
mining proved an asset in regard to
the accurate location of under-
ground water, the previous owner
having depended on the rainfalls for
supplying the stock. Mr. Behan
decided, however, that the indica-
tions warranted the outlay necessary
for boring, with the result that the
first sub-artesian bore in the district
was sunk on the “Garfield” run. The
water from this bore, though quite
clear was found to be salt for the
first few hundred feet, but at a lower
level (the average depth for securing
fresh water is 600 feet) it proved to
be of first-class quality. His pro-
gressiveness in this regard was one
of the main factors in the conversion
of the so-called “desert” country into
valuable pastoral land, and his
example has produced results that
have proved of immense benefit to
settlers. In 1914 he added to his
landed estate by the purchase of
“Bilbah Downs,” which embraces
nearly 80,000 acres, in the vicinity
of Emmet. Sheep are the mainstay
of this property, though the owner
also specializes in the breeding of
draught horses. He possesses other
and varied interests, which include
the importation and breeding on a
large scale of the pure American
bronzewing turkey, a department of
industry in which he has been most
successful, his birds being distri-
buted all over the Commonwealth.
Many centres of historical and
industrial interest in the Old World
and America were visited by him in
company with his wife in the year
1913, and during the trip he made a
close study of industries bearing on
pastoral affairs and of others which
are already, or which might with
benefit be established in Queensland.
Since reaching manhood he has been
more or less connected with public
matters of local importance, and
cheerfully devotes such small leisure
as now falls to his share to the
progress and advancement of the
community. He is the founder of
the Jericho Shire Council, of which
he has been a member since its
inception, and for a number of years
held aldermanic honours at Cairns,
where his labours will be long
remembered. Both as an honorary
official and as an exhibitor at the
various pastoral and agricultural
shows he has been prominent and
successful. He married in the year
1899 Mary Beatrice, daughter of the
late Patrick Landy, who was one of
the pioneers of Dalby and Bowen-
ville, and who occupied the mayoral
chair in the former town for many
years. To Mrs. Behan should be
accorded the tribute due to the
Australian women whose lives have
provided so fine an example of
wifehood. A loyal comrade to her
husband, she shared with him the
sacrifices inseparable from pioneer-
ing work, her unfailing sympathy
lightening the many arduous tasks
encountered in life’s journey. Of
the union there is a surviving family
of three sons and five daughters.


LINKING UP THE GREAT NORTH COAST LINE.
On Saturday, December 1, 1923, direct railway communication was established
between the North and the South when the Minister for Railways drove the first
train across the connecting link at Proserpine. It is now possible to travel by
rail from Dajarra, in North-western Queensland, to Perth, in Western Australia,
a distance of nearly 5,000 miles —the longest stretch of rail in the Empire.
