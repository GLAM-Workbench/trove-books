PREFACE.
Tue publication of this New Edition of Longmans* Latin
Course was suggested by the appearance in 1930 of the new
edition of Dr. B. H. Kennedy’s Revised Latin Primer, prepared
by Prof J. F. Mountford now of The University of Liver-
pool, followed by a similarly revised edition of the Shorter
Latin Primer in 1931. The Latin Course has long since
established itself in wide use, but it was felt, in spite of its
continued popularity, that the time had come to submit it
to the same process of revision.
Accordingly, while the general plan and arrangement of the
book and even, as far as possible, the numbering of the pages
and paragraphs have been retained in order not to incon-
venience teachers whose classes may be partly supplied with
the old edition, a number of modifications have been made in
the details.
The quantities of the vowels, for instance, in accordance
with the best modern practice, are now marked on a uniform
plan. All Long Vowels are marked with the sign and all
vowels not so marked are short. This involves the marking
of all long vowels in closed syllables, including those that are
now called “ Hidden ”. The marking of the great majority
of these “ hidden ” quantities presents no difficulty; in doubt-
ful cases the consensus of scholars has been followed.
The wording of some of the rules and definitions has been
modified for the sake of greater accuracy or lucidity.
In view of the fact that so much stress is laid on the
quantities of all the vowels, it has been thought advisable
to transfer the appendix on pronunciation from the end of
the book to the beginning.
It is hoped that in its revised form Longmans * Latin
Course will continue to do good service as a brief practical
introduction to the ordinary accidence and syntax of the
language combined with a sufficiency of exercises both ways.

PRONUNCIATION: QUANTITY:
SYLLABLES.
1. The Latin Alphabet contained twenty-three letters ;
ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTVXYZ.
The sounds which make up the Latin language are divided
into
(o) Vowels, which can be sounded alone.
(6) Consonants, which can only be sounded in conjunc-
tion with a vowel.
2. Pronunciation of Vowels.
The vowels were represented by the letters a, e, i, o, u,
and y.
The letters i and u were also used to represent consonant
sounds. Consonant iis pronounced like yin yet: consonant
u is pronounced like English w.
In some books consonant i is represented by j, and con-
sonant u is still generally represented by v.
3. Quantity of Vowels. Vowels are called ‘ long ’ or' short.’
A long vowel takes approximately twice as long to pronounce
as a short vowel. In this book all long vowels are indicated
by the sign ~ : occasionally the sign w is used to mark a
short vowel.
All Vowels not marked are short.
The following is approximately the pronunciation of the
vowels :
a (pratum), as a in father.
a (rapit), the same sound shortened, as the first a in aha 1
e (meta), as ey in prey, or French ete.
e (freta), as c in fret.


I (fldo), as i in machine.
I (plico), as i in fit.
6 (notus), as o in note.
6 (nota), as o in hot.
u (tu), as oo in shoot,
u (cutis), as oo in took,
y (Lydia, lyra = A vßla, \vpa ), as Frendh u.
S Note. —Knowledge of quantities can only bo gained by experi-
j ence : but (a) a vowel is long (i) before nf, ns, e.g. Infans, (ii) as the
) result of contraction, nil for nihil ; (6) a is short, (i) before
v nt, nd, e.g. araant (except compounds b'ko nondum) j (ii) before
) another vowel or h, e.g. mfius, triiho.
4. Diphthongs. A diphthong (double sound) is formed by
two vowels pronounced continuously. The Latin diphthongs
are:
ae (portae) = a-f e, nearly as ai in oisle.
au (aurum) = a + u, as ou in howse, German Haws.
06 (poena) = o e, as oi in boil.
eu (sen) = e + n, 6-uo pronounced in one breath.
ni (huic) = u + i, as French oui.
This last and the diphthongs ci (as ei in rein) and eu are
rare.
The diphthongs are long.
H represents a rough breathing.
5. Pronunciation of Consonants. The pronunciation of the
Latin consonants was much the same as that of the English,
except that
b before s or t is pronounced as p ; so urbs.
C always as in cat, never as in cider.
g always as in get, never as in gentle,
Consonant-i like yin yet; so ius.
n before c, g, qu, like ng in sing.
r is always trilled or rolled,
s always as es in macs, never as a in teas.


t always as in ten, never as in motion.
Consonant-u (v) as w in wall.
x always as in axe (= ks), never as in exact ( gs).
z as z in lazy or as dz in adze.
Doubled Consonants were both pronounced; so cc, like
kc in bookcase.
The aspirates, ch, th, ph, found only in borrowed words,
were pronounced :
ch like kh in inkhom.
th like th in hothouse.
ph like ph in taphouse.
6. Division o! Words into Syllables.
A syllable consists of a vowel or diphthong either alone
or with one or more consonants adjoining it: e-ram, pra-vus.
A single consonant between two vowels belongs to the
same syllable as the second vowel: e-ram, e-ra-mus.
If there are two or more consonants, the last consonant
belongs to the second vowel: mag-nus.
The letters c, g, t, d, p, b, f, however, combined with the
liqu ids 1, r both go with the second vowel: a-grum, trans.
The separate parts of compounds are kept distinct:
ab-rumpo.
A syllable ending in a vowel is called an open syllable : a
syllable ending with a consonant is called a dosed syllable.
7. Length of Syllables.
A syllable is long—
1. If it ends with a long vowel or dipnthong.
2. If it ends with two consonants or a double con-
sonant (x).
3. If it ends with a single consonant, when the follow-
ing syllable begins with a consonant. All other
syllables are short.
A short vowel in a long syllable does not become “ long by position ” ;
it remains short in pronunciation, though the syllable is long.
8. Accentuation.
Accent is the stress which is given to a syllable in pro


nunciation. Thus in father the first syllable has the stress,
in return the second syllable has the accent.
9. Roles for the accentuation of Latin words:
f(o) In words of two syllables the first syllable is accented ;
e.g. mea, tandem.
<b) In words of more than two syllables the accent is given
to the last syllable but one if that syllable is long; e.g.
Romani, emendo.
(c) In words of more than two syllables-, when the last but
one is short, the accent is given to the last syllable but two,
e.g. dominus; Rhudanus.
The last syllable but one is called the penultimate or penult; the last
syllable but two is called the antepenultimate or antepenult.
In this book the sign “ is used to indicate that a
vowel is pronounced long, as in mensa; it is not used
to show the length of a syllable.


DECLENSION.
1. Latin nouns have different endings to show the relation
in which they stand to other words in the sentence. Thus
mensa means • table, mensae means of a table, mensdrum, of
tables.
2. Inflected words, such as nouns, adjectives, pronouns or verbs*
consist of a Stem and an Inflexion. Thus in mensa, mensae, men-
sdrum, the stem is mensa-.
3. The different forms of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns obtained
by altering the endings are called cases. There are six cases in Latin—
Nominative, Vocative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative, Ablative.
4. The nominative case is used when the noun is the
subject of a verb.
To find the subject ask the question Who ? or what f before the
verb.
The hoy runs. Who runs ? The boy ; therefore boy is the subject,
and will be in the nominative case.
The wind blows. What blows ? The wind ; therefore wind is the
subject in the nominative case.
5. The vocative case is used in addressing a person or
thing.
O judge, be just. Judge is vocative case, because the judge is the
person addressed.
6. The accusative case is used to express the direct object l
of a transitive verb.
1 In the sentence, The king gives money to the girl, the word money is
said to bo the direct object of the verb because it directly receives the
action of the verb. But the girl is also indirectly concerned in the action,
and girl is said to be the indirect object.


To find the object ask the question Whom f or What t after the verb.
The king praises the soldier. Praises whom ? The soldier ; therefore
soldier is the direct object in the accusative case.
7. The genitive case 1 denotes the possessor. It correspond
tp the possess! re .ease in English, and also to a noun preceded
by of.
The boy’s dog, or the dog of the boy. Here boy’s and of a boy show
the possessor, and both words are in the genitive case.
8. The case 1 is used to denote the person (o whom a
thing is given or a thing is done.
He gives a book to the boy. He makes a kite for the boy. Here to
the boy and for the boy denote the indirect object, and they are in the
dative case. r
9. The ablative case has many uses. Its meaning is often
expressed by the words from, by, in or with. It is often used
to denote the instrument by which or with which anything is
done.
He kills the bull with a sword. Here with a sword is in the ablative
case.
10. There are five groups or declensions of nouns in Latin,
distinguished from each other by the ending of the genitive
singular, and by the final sound of the stem.
11. First declension. Stems in -a. Singular number
Stem; mensa-.
Nom. mens-a 2 table (subject).
Voc. mens-a 0 table.
Acc. mens-am table (object).
Gen. mens-ae of a table or table's,
Dat. mcns-ae •to or for a table.
, Abl. mens-a by, with or from a table.
1 Other uses of this case will be shown later.
« Throughout this book the quantity is not marked in the case of a
diphthong. Diphthongs are always long.


Buie I.—The article is lacking in Latin. It has no words
for a, an or the : mensa means table or a table or the table.
Exercise 1. Voc. 1, p. 127.
(1) Write out with English the singular of casa and agricola.
(2) Viva voce. Say the accusative case and meaning of the
following nouns :
nauta agricola insula casa
regina aqua terra puella,
(3) Viva voce. Say the Latin nominative and accusative of
the following:—
. the queen water the land an island
a cottage the fanner a girl the sailor
12. Before translating English into Latin or Latin into English it is
necessary to find, by parsing, the case of each noun. Thus, The sailorf
praises the cottage : tho verb is praises, and by asking the questions
shown in §§ 4 and 6, pp. 1,2, we find that sailor is subject and cottage
thu object or accusative case. We translate therefore :
The sailor praises the cottage, Nauta casam laudat.
Rule 2. Order of Words. —In arranging the words in a
Latin sentence put the verb last.
Exercise 2. Voo. 2, p. 127.
A. Find the subject and object and then translate into

(6) The sailor loves water.
(7) The farmer loves the island,

(7) Regina nautam am^t.
(8) Puella agricolam laudat.
Rule 3.—The genitive case is often translated by o! or’s.
The dative case is often translated by to or for.
The word in the genitive case is often placed before the word da-
'noting the thing possessed :
v »
agricolae filia, the farmer's daughter.
Exercise 3. Voc. 3, p. 127.

1 Translate in two ways.
’ Since flat is singular the Subject must be singular. Hastam can-
not be the subject because it is in the accusative case, and if nautae
were the subject the verb would be plural. The subject therefore is
contained in the verb (see Ex. 6, B. 13, and Rule 30, p. 61), and is he,
she, they, according to the sentence.
* Words in square brackets [ ] are to be omitted..


sailor. 17. The farmers give water to the sailors. 18. The
inhabitants of the island terrify the queen.
15. The second declension. Stems in -o.
The second declension consists of nouns whose nominative ends in -ns,
-er and -um, with the genitive in -i.
(1) Nouns in -us (masc.). Stem : domin-o
Nom. domin-US lord
Voc. domin-e 0 lord
Acc, domin-um lord

Dat. domin-6 to or for a lord
Abl. domin-o by, with or from
a lord
domin-I lords
domin-i O lords
domin-6s lords
domin-orum of lords
domin-is to or for lords
domin-is by, with or
from lords
16. Special cases ;
(o) The vocative singular 1 of many proper nouns ending in -ins
contracts -ie to -I, and the same rule applies to Hius, son ;
Claudius (a Roman name) Claudi, O Claudius
fHius, son mi, O son.
(6) The vocative of Dens, a God, is the same as the nominative:
Dens, O God.
(2) (a) Nouns in -er (masc.). Stem : agr-o

field
agr-i fields
agr-i 0 fields
agr-6s fields
agr-orum of fields

agr-is by, with or from
fields
Note. —Nouns declined like ager drop the e of the nominative in all
cases except the vocative.
Most nouns in -er are declined lie ager.
1 The vocative of other words in -ins was either not used or was
regular.


(2) (6) Nouns in-er like puer (masc.). Stem; puero-
Nom. puer boy
Voc. puer 0 boy
Ace. puer-um boy
Gen. puer-i of a boy
Dat. puer-6 to or for a boy

boy
puer-I boys
puer-I 0 boys
puer-5s boys
puer-orum of boys
puer-Is to or for boys

17. In nouns of this class the e is part of the Stem. The chief
nouns declined like puer, ere : ... .
gener gen. generi son-in-law
socer ~ soceri father-in-law
vesper „ vesperi evening
liheri „ liberorum children
iigniler signiferi standard-bearer
18. Vir, a man, is similarly declined :—■
Sing, vir, 6 vir, virum, viri, viro, viro
Plur. viri, 6 virl, vir6s, virorum, 1 viris, virlfl
(3) Nouns in -um (neut.). Stem : regno-.

19. Rules for the declension of nouns :
(1) Except in nouns of the second declension in -us (like dominut)
the vocative is always like the nominative.
(2) In neuter nouns the nominative, vocative and accusative are
always the same in both singular and plural. e
»Or virum.


(3) In neuter nouns the nominative, vocative and accusative plural
always end in -a. >
19 (a). Gender of second declension nouns.—Nouns in -us
and -er are masculine ; nouns in -um are neuter.
Exceptions.—(a) Coins, distaff, and humus, the ground, are feminine.
(6) Pelagus, the sea, virus, poison, and vulgus, the common people,
are neuter.
Rule 6. —When an English verb is made negative it is
often broken up into two words. The farmer praises the land.
The farmer does not praise the land. In translating such
sentences remember that the verb does praise is represented
in Latin by one word. The sentence really means the farmer
praises not' the land.
Agricola terrain non laudat.

A. ADJECTIVES OF THE FIRST AND SECOND
DECLENSION.
21. Latin adjectives are declined just like Latin nouns, and they
have different forms to show gender. Many adjectives end in rU3 for
masculine, -a for feminine, -am for neuter. Thus the Latin for good
is bonus (mase.), bona (fern.), bonum (neut.).
Masculines like bonus are declined like dominus, feminines like bona
are declined like mcnaa, neuters like bonum are declined like regnum.
21 (o). Some other adjectives have the masculine in -er, feminine
in -a, neuter in -am. Thus black = niger (maso.), nigra (fern.), nigrum
(neut.).
The only difference between these adjectives and words like bmut
is that the masculine niger is declined like ager.

26. ACTIVE VOICE. PASSIVE VOICE
amat he loves amat-ur he is loved 3
amant they love amant-ur they are loved
terret he terrifies terret-ur he is terrified
terrent they terrify terrent-ur they are terrified
From the above examples it will be seen that in simple tenses the
3rd person singular and plural of passive verbs is got from the active
by adding -nr.
1 Homo means’a human being-, vir means a man (as distinguished
from a woman), a hero.
3 Hiems (stem, Mem-) is the only Latin stem in m.
3 When the pupil has leamt the complete passive voice (R. 55, p. 106)
be will see that amatur means he is being loved, i.e., the action is repre-
sented as going on, not as completed.


In the sentence The farmer is wounded by the soldier, by the soldier
denotes the doer of the action or agent, and it is in the ablative case.
Rule 13.—The ablative oi the agent (; person) requires the pre-
position a or ab. 1
The ablative of the instrument (§ 9, p. 2) has no preposition.
Agent. 2 The farmer is wounded by the soldier
Agricola a milite vulneratur
Instrument. The farmer is wounded by 3 a sword
Agricola gladio vulneratur
Exercise 21.
A. Put the following verbs into the passive voice, saying or
writing the English ;
dat vulnerat delectat mittit videt laudat
dant vulnerant delectant mittunt vident laudant
B. Say which of the italicised phrases denote agent and
which instrument ; then translate : ’
1. The girl is praised by [her] mother. 2. The girls are
praised by the father. 3. The island is praised by the queen.
4. The queen is delighted by the flowers, 5. The queen is
delighted by the horses. 6. The soldier is sent by Gccsar.
7. The soldiers are sent by the leader. 8. The soldiers are
delighted by the booty. 9. The boy is praised by the farmer.
10, The girl is terrified by the eagle.
Exercise 22.
A. 1. Legis ducem bonum habet. 2. Caesar multas

1 A is used before a consonant (including consonant -i, and -u (v));
ab before a vowel or h: & rege, by the king ; ab amico, by a friend;
ab hostibus, by the enemy. It will be seen later that ab has other
meanings. For the present, however, it will only mean by, denoting
the agent.
•It should be noted that the agent must be a living person or
animal.
• The instrument is expressed in English by by or with. Thegf
words do not appear in the Latin.

B. Stems in -i (Gen. Plur. in -ium):
For gender see Appendix II.
28. The point to bo noticed is that nouns with -i stems have -ium in
the genitive plural, sometimes -i in the ablative singular, and in the case
of neuter nouns -ia.in the nominative plural.
1 marum, as if from a consonant stem.
2*


29. There are four classes of stems in -i:—
(1) Stems with nom. sing, in -is, and in -er from stems in
-ri-, not increasing l in the gen. sing.: with gen. plur. in -ium 2 ;
e.g., hostis, civis, imber, uter.
Two exceptions to this rule are :
;
canis (c) dog gen. plur. canum
iuvenis (c) young person gen. plur. iuvenum
(2) Stems with nom. sing, in -es, e.g., nubgs.
(3) Stems which have two consonants before the -i.
These generally drop i before the s in the nom. sing., e.g.,
mons (stem: monti-), mountain; urbs (stem: urbi), city;
dSns (stem : denti), tooth.
(4) Neuter stems in -i.
The nom. sing, ends in -e, -al, -ar.
The i of the stem is changed to e, or dropped; e.g., mare,
sea; animal, animal; calcar, spur,
30. Notes on -i stems.
Some stems in -i have the accusative singular in -im, the ablative
singular in -I, and occasionally the nominative and accusative plural in
•is.
(1) The accusative -im is always found in names of rivers and
towns, e.g., Tiberis, the Tiber, Neapolis, Naples, and in the nouns sitis
(fern.), thirst, tussis (fem.), cough, and vis (fern.), force.
1 When the genitive singular has more syllables than the nominative,
as in dux, duc-is, the noun is said to increase in the genitive. When the
nominative and genitive singular have the same number of syllables,
as in hostis, hostis; imber, imbris, the noun is spoken of as not increasing
in the genitive.
Nouns which do not increase are sometimes called Parisyllabio (t’.e.,
equal-syllabled); those which increase are called Imparisyllabic.
1 The only common parisyllabio words which do not follow this rule
are pater, mater, frater, canis, iuvenis and senes, all having -nm in the
genitive plural.


The following sometimes have -im : febris (Ism.),,fever; turns (fem.),
tower; securis (fem.), axe; puppis (fern.), stem; navis (fem.), ship, anil
a few others.
(2) The ablative in i- is always found in those words which have the
accusative in -im, and sometimes in the following : avis (fem.), bird;
imber (maso.), shower; navis (fem.), ship; turris (fem.), tower, and usually
in ignis (maso.), fire. .
Exercise 25.
(1) Give nominative and genitive plural of:—
auris mensis testis canis
civia vulpes arx turris

(2) Put into Latin :

81. B. ADJECTIVES OF THE THIRD DECLENSION.
Most adjectives of the third declension fall under three
classes :
I. Adjectives of three terminations (rare): —
Masc. Seer, Fern, acris, Neut. acre, keen.
11. Adjectives of two terminations :
Masc. and Fern, fortis, Neut. forte, brave.
111, Adjectives of one termination ;
Masc., Fern, and Neut. felix, happy ;
Masc., Fern, and Neut. prudens, prudent.
All those adjectives have stoma in -i. They have therefore :
1. -i in the ablative singular.
2. -ium in the genitive plural.
3. -ia in the neuter plural.

32. There are only eleven adjectives declined like doer, of which the
following are the chief :
alacer, alacris, alaore, brisk
equester, equestris, equestre, equestrian
pedester, pedestris, pedestre, pedestrian
saliiber, salubris, salubre, healthy
celer, 1 celeris, celere, swift
33. Note. —Many words of this class end in -ns,’ e.g., prfldens (gen.
prudentis), prudent. They are dech’ned exactly like felix. Thus the
masculine and feminine would bo :
singular, prudens, prudent-em, prudent-is, prudent-I, prudent-I;
plural, prudent-es, prudent-es, prudent-ium, prudont-ibus, prudent-ibus.
1 The word oeleres, meaning the body-guard of the kings of ancient
Rome, takes -nm in the gen. plur. The adjective celer also has the gen.
plur. in -nm : but notice that celer retains the oin declension, because
the stem itself ends in eri-.
' * Many words of this class are present participles. They take -e in
the ablative singular in certain constructions to be explained later.
Used as adjectives pure and simple, however, they take -I,

84. There is also a group of adjectives of the third declen-
sion with consonant stems, which have the ablative in -e, the
genitive plural in -um, and the neuter plural in -a. Most of
these are comparatives like—Masc. and Fern, fortior, Neut.
fortius, braver. (See § 39, p. 47.)
34 (o). In addition to comparatives there are a few third declension
adjectives of one termination 1 with the ablative in -e, the genitive
plural in -um and the neuter plural in -a. The commonest words of this
class are : i-
Dives 1 gen. divitis rich
Pauper 1 „ pauperis poor
Supples l supplicis suppliant
Votus >, veteris old
1 Moat words of this class can be used as nouns : dives, a rich man.

the fighter is and says in; the Romans think of where the fighting comes
from and say out of or from.


38. Notes. —(l) A contracted form of the genitive and dative
singular in -e, for ei is found in Virgil and Horace.
(2) Dies and res aro the only nouns of the fifth declension which are
declined throughout in singular and plural. Most of the others have no
plural, though the nominative and accusative plural are found in a few
words, e.g., acies, facies, spes, etc.
(3) Gender of fifth declension : Dies 1 and meridies ( mid-day) are
masculine: all others are feminine.
(4) The meaning of res is always a trouble to beginners. It means
thing or things in the sense of circumstances or ailairs.

however, should always make it masculine until they have acquired
greater experience.

COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.
Adjectives have three degrees of comparison :
Positive. Comparative. Superlative.
dur-us, hard dur-ior, harder dur-issimus, hardest
39. In Latin the comparative is formed from the positive
by adding -ior (-ius) to the last consonant of the stem. Thus
durus (stem, dur-o-) comparative dur-ior.
The superlative is generally formed by adding -issimus.
(-a, -um) to the last consonant of the stem.
Thus :
40. Special cases.—All adjectives with stems in -ro, -ri
form the superlative by doubling the last consonant of the
stem and adding -imus. Words like niger have e before rin
the superlative.

41. Six adjectives with stems in -ili are regular in the
comparative, but form the superlative by doubling the last
consonant of the stem and adding -imus.
41 (a). All other adjectives in -ilis are regular, e.g.,
nsbil-is noble nobil-ior nobil-issimus
Rule 16. —All comparatives are declined, as consonant
stems, like fortior (masc. and fern.), fortius (neut.), p. 39 ; all
superlatives like bonus, -a, -um.

ment
a bold plan
a bolder plan
the boldest plan
a beautiful garden
a more beautiful garden

garden
a powerful leader
a more powerful leader
the most powerful leader


Rule 17. — In comparing one thing with another, the conjunction
qnam is used in the same way ns than in English. Things compared by
quam must be in the same case. This can be easily shown if we com-
plete the sentence. Thus The earth is larger than the moon means The
earth is larger than the moon (is), from which we see that moon is nomina-
tive to is (understood).
Rule 18. —When the noun after quam is either nominative
or accusative quam is more often than not omitted, and the
noun put in the ablative. 1
The sailor is stronger than Nauta mllite validior est
the soldier rather than
Nauta validior est quam miles
With every other case quam must he used.
Rule 19. —When more 2 and most 2 are used with adjectives
they merely indicate the comparative and superlative degrees,
and are not translated (as a rule 8 ) by a separate word, e.g.,
more beautiful = pulchrior.

Rule 20.—Comparatives and superlatives can be trans-
lated in several ways :
(а) Fortior means braver or rather brave or too brave.
(б) Fortissimus means bravest or very brave.
Rule 21. —Latin uses the superlative much more freely than
the English. Thus The brave leader was killed could be trans-
lated The very brave leader , etc.

43. IRREGULAR COMPARISON. 1
43. Notes. —(l) Multum is the neuter of multus. Its use is ex-
plained in R. 22, p. 53.
(2) In the singular plus is only used as a noun in the neuter; see
R. 22, p. 53. In the plural it is an adjective, and is thus declined :
1 Some comparatives and superlatives are formed from stems dis-
tinct from that of the positive.
* Remember R. 20 (6), p. 50. Maximus especially very often means
very great; plurimum, very much; optimus, very good, etc.
• Notice that the neuter singular of all comparatives is got by
changing -or into -us.

45. Notes. —(l) The adjectives senex, old, and iuvenis, young (often
used as substantives) ore the positives of senior and iunior. The other
comparatives correspond to adverbs or propositions from the same
stem: ultra, infra, intra, extra, prope, supra, though the positive
adjectives inferus, extents, posterus and superus are sometimes found.
(2) In natu maximus, etc., natu is the ablative of a noun meaning
by birth. Thus natu maximus means greatest by birth, i.e., oldest. In
declining, natu remains unaltered. Thus natu maxima, natu maximi.
(3) Natu maior can bo used for senior, and natu minor for iunior.
46. Words ending in -dicus, -ficus and -volus form the comparative
in -entior and the superlative in -entissimus, as if from -dicens, etc.
maledicus slanderous maledlcentior maledicentissimus
munificus munificent munificentior munificentissimns
benevolus benevolent benevoleutior benevolentissimus
47. Words ending in -eus, -ius, and -uus are generally
compared by prefixing the adverb magis, more; maxime, most.
Thus noxius, hurtful; magis noxius, maxime noxius.
Note. —In declining such words, magis and maxime being adverbs
(see note 2, Voo. 7, p. 128), remain unaltered. Thus the feminine is
magis noxia, accusative magis noxiam. etc., neuter magis noxium, etc.

to a very dutiful son
Rule 22. —When the words much, 1 more, most are used
with a noun in the singular number, the neuter nouns multum,
plus, plurimum are used, with the dependent noun in the
genitive:
Much money, Multum pecuniae
The genitive used with words of this kind is called the partitive a
genitive because it means a part of the thing spoken of. Compare
R. 24, p. 55.
With plural nouns the words many, 1 more, most are treated
as adjectives agreeing with their nouns in every way;
More bravery, Plus fortitudinis
More daughters, Plures filiae
Exercise 40.

adjectives.

depends.

The Demonstrative Pronoun, is, ea, id is used for tho Per-
sonal Pronoun of the 3rd person, he, she, it.
48 (a). The reflexive pronoun (3rd person) has no nomina-
tive. Its declension is the same for all genders and for singular
and plural.
Ace. se or sese himself, herself, itself, themselves.
Gen. sui of ,, ,, ,, ,,
Hat. sibi to ,, ,, ,, ,,
Abl. so or sese by „ „ „ „
Note. — (1) The double form sese is used emphatically for s3
(accusative and ablative).
49. Present tense of the verb To be.
Personal pronouns used as subjects of verbs are not expressed
except fhon emphatic. See R. 30, p. 61.
Rule 23. —When you refers to one person it must be trans-
lated in Latin by tu, and the corresponding singular verb must
be used.


Rule 24,— Nostrum, of us, and vestrum, of you, can only
be used when a number is referred to. 1 Nostri, of us, and
vestrl, of you, are used in other cases.
Many of us Multi nostrum
He is mindful of us Memor nostri est
Exercise 41.
A. 1. Mihi multos libros pater dat. 2. Nos sumus in horto,
vos estis in urbe., 3. Els libros dat, nobis equos (dat). 4. Me
mater culpat, te laudat. 5. Nemo nostrum vos laudat. 6.
Hostes audaces sunt; consilia ducis eis nota sunt. 7. Tibi
hortus gratus est, nobis urbs grata est. 8. In me est amor
patriae, 9. Stulti saepe se laudant. 10. Soror bona est;
fratres earn laudant.
B. 1. The leader praises us. 2. Who blames you, 0 son ?
3. Many of us blame her. 4. The city is not pleasing to us in
summer. 5. The children are always mindful of us. 6. In
you, 0 soldiers, there is great love of valour. 7. Which of
you blames me ? 8. Wise [men] do not praise themselves.
9. The plans of the enemy are known to him. 10. To me he
gives gold, to you silver. ‘
Rule 25.—Translation of it and they. In Latin it and
they may be masculine, feminine or neuter, according to the
gender of the word they stand for.
Thus it standing ior field, ager (maso.) = is.
it „ „ spear, hasta (fern.) = ea.
it „ „ war, bellum (neut.) = id.
Rule 26.— 15, ea, id is a demonstrative pronoun used adjeo-
tively and meaning that, 2 plural those.
At that time Eo tempore
In those times Eis temporibus
1 Nostrum and vestrum axe partitive genitives, i.e., they can only be
used when a number (i.e., a part) of us or of you is meant. All of us
is nos o nines.
* It will be seen from this rule that when is is used to translate be
it really means that man; ea means that woman, etc.


The plurals of is, viz., il, eae, ea, will therefore be frequently
translated by those as well as by they and them.
Exercise 43.
A. 1. Equus niger est; quia eum non laudat 1 2. Consilia
bona sunt; ea nobis nota sunt. 3. Fomina bona sese non
laudat. 4. Rex scutum militi dat; miles id amico dat. 5.

7. Patria els grata est, earn omnes laudant; 8. Ea nocto
comites in castrls erant. 9. Castra in conspectu urbis sunt; 1
in els 1 sunt multi milites. 10. Noctes hiemis longae sunt;
quis nostrum eas laudat ?
B. 1. The temple is in the wood; the maidens adorn it
with flowers. 2. To them the farmers give corn. 3. In that
summer the leader was in Italy. 4. That queen has many
islands. 5. In that island are many farmers. G. The wars of
the Gauls are known to you ; Caesar narrates (= ndrrat) them.
7. The women are brave; the citizens praise them. 8. He
gives those things (R. 15 (6), p. 41) to the leader. 9. To me
he gives water ; to her wine. 10. In us is love of [our] father-
land.
50. POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVES.
mens, mea, meum my, mine
tuus, tua, tuum thy, thine
suus, sua, suum his, hers, Us, their
noster, nostra, nostrum our, ours
vester, vestra, vestrum your, yours
Those words are all declined like bonus or niger, and like all adjec-
tives they agree in gender, case and number with their nouns. Thus
pater meus, accusative patrem meum ; mater mea, dative matri meae.
Rule 27. — The possessive adjective is as often as not placed
after its noun : our father = pater noster.
1 The pupil should remember the number and gender of castra.

51. How to translate his, her, etc.
There is some difficulty in translating the words his, her, its and
their. Sometimes suus is used, sometimes eius, eorum, earum.
Rule 28.—(o) Suus can only be used when it refers to the
subject l of the clause in which it stands.
The king praises his soldiers. Milites suos rex laudat.
The subject of praises is king; his = the king’s, i-e., his stands for
the subject of the sentence, and is therefore translated by SUUS.
In using smis it must be noted that suus must agree with
the noun it goes with. Thus 2 :—
his mother suam matrem his shield sunru scutum
his sword suum gladium their spear suam hastam
his friends suos amicos their spears suas hastas
%* Note. —Each of the words suus, sua, suuzn can mean his, her,
its or their, the gender depending entirely on the noun his, etc., agrees
with. Thus in the case of suus :
The father praises his son = suum fllium
The mother praises her son = suum fllium
The horse carries its master = suum dominum
The soldiers praise their leader = suum dueom
1 These rules will require a slight qualification later. For the present
they will cover all cases that occur.
* For the present it is better not to use suus in the nominative.


(6) When his, her, its or their do not stand for the subject
of the sentence the words eius, csnim, eamm are used.
I praise her daughters. Eitis filias ego laudo
Here lis the subject of the sentence; her cannot stand for I, and
so we translate, I praise the daughters ol that [woman]. R. 26, p. 66.
*** Note. —The following is a very good test for suns and
eius : If his, her, etc., can be turned into that man’s, that
woman’s, etc., eius, etc. (not suus), must be used.
Thus, I praise her (= that woman’s) daughter [eius flliam]. In the
queen praises her daughters, if her means the queen’s suus is used by R.
28. p. 58. If, however, her means that woman’s, eius is used.
Remember that suus is an adjective and agrees in number,
gender and case with the noun it is used with ; eius, etc., are
not adjectives, but the genitive cases of is, ea, id, and they
agree with the words they stand for in number and gender.
The women are brave ; I praise Feminae fortes sunt; eamm
their steadfastness constantiam laudo
(c) In cases like Ccesar and his friend eius is always used. 1
Ccesar and bis friend Caesar et eius amicus
Exeeoise 44.
Viva voce. Translate the following, using suus (R. 28,
p. 68): —
his friends (acc.) their garden (aco.) his arrows (aco.)
of his friends their bodies his slaves (aco.)
her brother (acc.) their mother (aco.) his swords (aco.)
her horses (acc.) of their sister his shields (acc.)
A. I. Pueri matrem suam laudant. 2. Puella aegra est;
eius mater tristis est. 3. Dux milites laudat; eorum 2 liberis
pecduiara dat. 4. In horto sunt multae arbores; edrum 2
fru-‘.as bonus est. 6. Dux suos (R. 15, p. 41) laudat. 6.
1 Ccesar and his friend are here means Ccesar is here and his friend is
here. Thus bis is in one sentence and refers to the subject of another,
and so does not fall under R. 28, p. 68.
• What words do these words refer to I Explain their gender.


Homo stultissimus sua (R. 15 (6), p. 41) semper laudat. 7.
Insula est magna ; eiua incolae sunt nautae. 8. Stulti verba
sua amant.
B. 1. My brothers always praise their friends. 2. Our
plans are known to our companions. 3. The girl loves her
father and her mother, her sisters and her brothers. 4. The
slave loves his children. 5. The islands are in the great sea ;
their inhabitants are very bold. 6. Your words, 0 Claudius,
are not always wise. 7. The hunter wounds the lion with his
spear. 8, Claudius sends his [men] into Italy. 9. Claudius
praises the girl and her companions. 10. The boys and their
companions are bold and brave.
52. THE VERB.
Latin verbs are divided into four classes or conjugations according
to the final sound of the present stem as scon in the present infinitive
active.
Ist conjugation (A-stems) ending in -are, amare to love
2nd conjugation (E-stems) „ -ere, monere to advise
3rd conjugation (consonant and U-stems) „ -ere, regero to rule
4th conjugation (1-stems) „ -ire, audiro to hear
53. Verbs have four principal parts, from whicli the various tenses,
moods, persons, numbers, etc., are obtained by altering the endings.
64. The principal parts of a verb are :
(1) The present indicative ( amd ).
(2) The present infinitive (amdre).
(3) The perfect indicative ( amdvi).
(4) The supine in -um 1 (amdtum).
Present tense of amo.
SINGULAR. PLURAL.
ams, l love or am loving. ama-mus, we love or are loving
ama-S, thou lovest or art loving ama-tis, you love or are loving
ama-t, he loves or is loving ama-nt, they love or are loving
It will be seen that the endings are obtained by changing the final
-a into -os, -at, etc.
1 The supine in -um, as will bo explained later, is only used to
denote purpose after verbs of motion ; the supine in -u is only used after
certain adjectives, e.g., hard, easy, etc.


Rule 29.—In Latin there is no separate continuous 1 form of
the tense. Am5 means / love and I am loving.
Rule 30.—The subject pronouns of verbs are not expressed
unless they are very emphatic. (We) love = amdmus.
Exercise 45.
A. Write out the present tense of culpd, I blame; 6m3,
I adorn; do, I give. (See footnote 1, p. 63.)
B. Give the Latin for :—
we praise
they praise
thou praisest
he wounds
we wound
they wound
they give
I give
thou givest
thou blamest
they blame
he delights
we delight
we lay waste
we adorn
you adorn
you delight
you wound
he ploughs
he wounds
thou praisest
we plough
we give
you give
C. Put into English :—
ornamus
ornas
delectant
aro
aratis
vastaraus
vastant
dant
das
culpas
culpatis
laudamus
datis
culparaus
vulnerat
vasto
Imperfect tense of amo.
ama-bam, I was loving
ama-b5s, thou wast loving
araS-bat, he was loving
amd-bamus, we were loving
ama-batis, you were loving
ama-bant, they were loving
Future tense of amo.
ama-bo, I shall love
ama-bis, thou wilt love
ama-bit, he will love
ama-bimus, we shall love
ama-bitis, you will love
ama-bunt, they will love
The imperfect endings of am-o are got by changing the -o into
•Sham, etc. ; the future by changing 6 into - abo , etc.
Euie 31.—The imperfect tense, e.g., amabam. besides meaning
I was loving (continuous), also means I used-to-love.
1 culpo, I blame, corresponds to two tenses in English: I blame
(momentary present), or I am blaming (continuous present).


Exercise 46.
(1) Write out imperfect and future of laudo, aro and do.
(2) Put into Latin :
he was blaming 1 they were pointing out, they were over-
we shall blame we shall lay waste coming
they were adorning we are laying waste they were entering
1 shall adorn we were laying waste I was entering
you will delight he was ploughing I was giving
I was delighting he will plough I shall give
I shall point out
A. 1. Nauta agricolam culpabat. 2. Galll Romanos super-
abunt. 3. Scipio Insulam superabat. 4. Agricola locum
militibus monstrabat. 5. Hieme agricolae agros arabunt. 6.
Dux urbem eras intrabit. 7. Romani fines hostium vastabunt.
8. Monstrabimus urbem pulchemmam militibus. 9. Cur,
miles, ducem culpabas ? 10. Priore hello Romani ex equis
(Ex. 34, A. 2, p. 45) pugnabant (R. 31, p. 61).
B. 1. Thou wilt overcome the Gauls. 2. The boys were
pointing out the place to the leader. 3. The mother will adorn
the girl with a beautiful garment. 4. The girls were adorning
the temple with flowers. 5. Why were you not ploughing the
fertile valley ? 6. [We] shall give rewards to the soldiers.
7. They were laying-waste the territories of the Gauls. 8. The
soldiers were entering the city. 9. The diligent husbandman
will plough [his] land. 10. The Gauls used-to-fight (R. 31,
p. 61) in (= out of) chariots.
65. When the verb means that an action is completed at the time
referred to, the tense is said to be perfect. Thus I write is present; I
have written, meaning that the action is completed, is perfect.
There are three perfects corresponding to the present, imperfect
and future.
1 The pupil should first say what the tense of the English is.


Simple Tenses. Perfect Tenses.
Present — I love Present perfect or perfect—/ have loved
Imperfect— l was loving Past perfect or pluperfect— l had loved
Future— I shall love Future perfect— l shall have loved
Note. —Have shows that the tense is the perfect; had the pluper-
fect ; shall have shows the future perfect.
56, In Latin verbs all perfect tenses are got by adding
different endings to the perfect stem. In the same verb this
perfect stem is found in all the perfect tenses.
Verbs like amo form the perfect stem by changing -6 into
-av. Thus amo-, amav-; laudb-, laudav-.
Note.—The perfect of do, I give, is ded-i. 1
The perfect tenses of amo. Perfect stem amav-.
PERFECT. 2
amav-i, I have loved or I loved
amav-istl, thou hast loved or thou lovedst
amav-it, he has loved or he loved
amav-imus, we have loved or we loved-
amav-istis, you have loved or you loved
amav-erunt or amav-ere, they have loved or they loved
PLUPERFECT. 2 FUTURE PERFECT. 2
amav-eram, I had loved amsv-ers, l shall have loved
am&v-er&s, thou hadsl loved amav-eris, thou wilt have loved
amav-erat, he had loved amav-erit, he will have loved
amav-eramus, we had loved amav-erimus, we shall have loved
amav-eratis, you had loved amav-eritis, you wiU have loved
amav-erant, they had loved amav-erint, they will have loved
Rule 32 (a). —The perfect tense has two meanings. Thus
amivi means I have loved and I loved.
1 This is the only verb which has a short a in the infinitive (dare).
The short a (the stem vowel) occurs throughout the verb, except in the
2nd person singular present indicative (das) and in the imperative
singular (da). Thus, damus, datis ; dabo, etc. ; dabam, etc.
* The endings -i, -isti, etc., should first be learned separately. They
occur in these tenses of all Latin verba.


Rul.s 32 (6). —When I loved is made negative it becomes
I did not love. I did not love means I loved not, and did love
must be translated generally by the perfect tense.
Exercise 47.
(1) Give the perfect stem of the following verbs :
culpo vasts 6rns do
porto aro superb regno
vulncro delectb intro parb
(2) Say the endings of the pluperfect and future perfect.
(3) Turn into Latin :

you had carried we prepared
ho has reigned we avoided
A. 1. lam nautae aurum in templum portaverant. 2. Galli

Britannia regnaverat. 4. Dux milites laudabat quod Gallos
bellb superaverant. 5. Priore anno in Gallia strenue pugnav-
imus. 6. Convocaverunt sapientes (R. 15 and 30, pp. 41, 01)
quod in magno periculo sunt. 7. Insulae incolae non in oppidis
habitavcrunt. 8. Cervus crura culpaverat; cornua laudaverat,
9. Duces servis anna dederunt quod erant in magno periculo.
10. Consul militum impetum laudabat.
B. 1, By [his] long legs the stag had avoided many dangers.
2. The allies have prepared arms. 3. They had dwelt for
many years in the island. 4. [We] have carried the swords
into the citadel. 5. The Gauls dwelt in the woods. 6. [ln]

Subjunctive Mood of amo.
PRESENT. PERFECT,
amcm, I may love amav-erim, 1 1 may have loved
ames, thou mayest love amav-eris, thou mayst have loved
amet, he may love amav-erit, he may have loved
amgmus, we may love amav-erimus, we may have loved
ametis, you may love amav-eritis, you may have loved
ament, they may love amav-erint, they may have loved
IMPERFECT. PLUPERFECT,
ama-rem, I might love amav-issem, 1 1 might have loved
ama-res, thou mighlest love amav-isses, thou mighlesl have loved
ama-ret, he might love amav-isset, he might have loved
ama-remus, we might love amav-issemus, we might have loved
ama-retis, you might love amav-issetis, you might have loved
ama-rent, they might love amav-issent, they might have loved
Rule 33. — The imperfect subjunctive can always be found
by adding the endings -m, -s, etc., to the infinitive.
Rule 34. —The present subjunctive is often translated by the
English may; the imperfect subjunctive by might (or should);
the perfect subjunctive by may have ; and the pluperfect sub-
junctive by might (or should) have. But the Latin subjunctive
is often used when the corresponding English is indicative.
57. The subjunctive in clauses of purpose :
He praises the soldier that he may fight well; the words
in thick type denote purpose, and they form a clause of
purpose, the verb being the subjunctive.
In clauses of purpose that is translated by ut; that .. .
not by no. 2
(а) He praises the soldier that he Mllitem laudat ut bene
may fight well pugnet
(б) Ho praises the soldier that he Militem laudat ne male
may not fight badly pugnet
1 Notice that the stem amav- is still the same os in the perfect tenses
of the indicative. See p. SG.
*ln English the infinitive ia often used to express purpose; in
Latin, never.
3 •


58. In negative clauses of purpose lest is sometimes used instead of
that .. . not. Lest is translated by ne, and always takes the subjunc-
tive.
59. The tense used in the subjunctive always depends on the tense
of the principal verb. For this purpose all tenses are divided into two
classes—(a) tenses which do not refer to the past, often called primary
tenses; (6) tenses which do refer to the past, called historic or past
tenses.
(a) Primary Tenses. (b) Historic Tenses.
Present Imperfect
Future simple Pluperfect
Future perfect Perfect (aorist), without have (R. 32
True Perfect with have (R. 32 (a), p. 63).
(a), p. 63)
Rule 33. Sequence of tenses. I—The 1 —The present subjunctive is used after
primary teases; the imperfect subjunctive is used after historic tenses.*
Thus (a) He fights that he may conquer.
(b) He fought that he might conquer.
Rule 36.—Since the perfect indicative has two meanings
(R. 32 (a), p. 63) it can be followed by either present subjunctive
or imperfect subjunctive, the one used depending entirely on
the meaning of the perfect.
(a) He has fought (pugnavit) that he may overcome
(superet).
(b) He fought (pugnavit) that he might overcome (superaret).
Exercise 48.
Viva voce :—
A. he may blame we may fight I may plough
we may blame we may enter I might plough
they may lay waste we may give you may delight
he might give they might overcome you might de-
they might give they might carry light
they may give they might avoid they may adorn
they might adorn
1 1.e., tho way in which one tense follows another.
1 This rule will be amplified later. It is given bere in this incom-
plete form in order that the pupil may see from the very first how one
tense depends on another.


Before translating B explain how R. 35, p. 66, on the sequence
of tenses is observed in the italicised verbs.

The Imperative Mood, of Amo.
PRESENT TENSE.
ama, love (Ihou) amd-te, love {ye)
FUTURE OR LEGAL IMPERATIVE.
• ama-to, thou must love ama-tote, you must love
ama-to, he must love ama-nto, they must love
60. What; is called the future imperative is chiefly used in wills and
legal documents. It is called future because it usually implies that the
action referred to will be done not in the immediate present, but at
Borne future time.
61. Rules for the imperative :—•
Rule 37.—(a) The imperative mood expresses a command.
(b) In all negative commands the word for not is ne.
Note.—A negative command is often called a prohibition.
(c) When the command is 2nd person and negative it is
translated 1 by ne and the perfect subjunctive. B
Praise the king Lauda regem
Do not praise the king Ne regem laudaverls
.Do not praise, do not blame, etc., is to bo translated therefore by
the perfect subjunctive with ne.
(d) When a command is Ist or 3rd person it is translated by
the present subjunctive. Thus Let us praise = may we praise,
Let him praise = may he praise.
Let us praise the king Regem laudemus
Let him not hasten NS festinet
1 That is in prose. In poetry ne is sometimes used with the ordinary
imperative.
• Other ways of translating a negative command will be explained
later. The explanation of this use of the perfect subjunctive; is' as
follows: instead of bluntly saying Do not praise, tho JRomana said
courteously May you not have praised /


Exercise 50.
Rule 38. —Whenever you is used in speaking of one 1 person
always translate it by thou in Latin, making the verb singular.
Put into Latin 2 :
call do not carry let him not wound enter

62. Shorter Forms of Perfect Tenses.
_. Alongside of Perfects in -svi, -evi, -dvl Shorter Forms are
often found, in which -vl, -ve or -ve do not appear.
(а) Thus in the first conjugation vi or ve is often omitted,

audiveram „ audieram, etc.
audlverim' „ audierim, etc.
audivissem „ audissem, etc.
Rule 39. —When two nouns of similar meaning (denoting
things which often go together) are joined by and, -que is used
instead of et, and it is joined on to the end of the second noun.
Flowers and trees Flores arboresque
Rule 39 (a). —He gives me money = He gives money to me.
After verbs like give, owe, offer, set, etc., to (used to translate the
dative case) is often omitted in English. In Latin the dative
must always be used in such cases.
He gives the boy money Puerd pecuniam dat.

1 The verb to have is used as an auxiliary in forming the perfect
tenses, j 55, p. 62, e.g., he has ploughed. But it con also be an inde-
pendent verb, moaning to possess, when it is translated by habeo.
• The imperfect must very often be translated by the simple past,
e.g., monebat = he was advising or he advised.


63. The clause introduced by si =if expresses a condition. If he
overcomes the enemy all will praise him.
Rule 40.—In English if is followed by the present even
when the future is really meant. In Latin si must bo followed
by the future perfect l or future 1 whenever the future is meant.
If he overcomes 2 the enemy Si hostes superaverit 2 omnes
all men will praise him. cum laudabunt.
The same rule applies to nisi, if not, unless.

1 Whether the future or future perfect is used depends entirely on
•the sense, ll'e will go out if thejsun shines, t.e., if the sun shall be shining.
Here the future simple is the correct tense. But He will repay me if he
succeeds means when he shall have succeeded, and the future perfect
must bo used in Latin.
a ln this sentence the “ overcoming takes place before the “ prais-
ing.” The prior action requires the future perfect.

The soldier obeys the leader Miles duel paret
Note. —Verbs like “ obey ” are transitive in English, but intransi-

as their only object.

THE INFINITIVE.
64.—The Latin infinitive being a verb noun may be used
(a) as subject or (6) as object of a verb.
(а) To praise is pleasanter Laudare quam culpare iu-
than to blame cundius est
(б) The soldier prepares to Miles pugnare parat
fight
If it is the infinitive of a transitive verb it can have an
object. He prepares to plough the field. Agrum arare parat.
Exercise 60.
On the Infinitives of the four Conjugations.
Rule 44. —T0 walk is pleasant means To walk is a pleasant
(thing). The infinitive, used as a noun, is always neuter.
Viva voce. Say with English the infinitive, present and
perfect, of the following verbs :
regno vasts doceo rego vinco audio
intro praebeo moved mitto custodio sepelio
A. 1. Pugnare pro_(= for) patria est pulchrum. 2. Rex
exercitum ducere in Italiam statuit. 3. Post pugnam dux
1 This means motion towards (R. 7, p. 12. footnote).


corpora sepelire parabat. 4. Militibus est turpe captivos male
custodivisse. 5. Erat difficillimum GallSs superare. 6. Galli
multos carros cmero statuerant. 7. Soci! statuunt auxilium
ad Remands mittero. 8. Exemplum bonum praebere est
difficile. 9. Ambulare in silvis iucundisaimum est. 10. Voces
puellarum audire est dulce.
B. 1. It is not easy to rule well. 2. To walk in summer
delights boys. 3. To plough the land is useful. 4. It is
difficult to write well. 5. The leader decides to send hostages.
6. The soldier prepares to set free the captives. 7. It is dis-

( =. love) to fight vigorously. 9. To have gold is very pleasant.
10. To have said wise words is always useful.
65. The infinitive continued.
Rule 45. —After verbs of asking, commanding, advising
and striving the English infinitive is translated by ut or ne
and the subjunctive. v
I ask the boy to read Puerum rogo ut legat
He asked the boy not to hasten Puerum rogavit ne festinaret
The reason for this is that in such cases the English infinitive ox-
presses purpose. I ask you to coma means I ask you so that you may
come.
The following rhyme is useful: —
With ask, command, advise and strive
By ut translate infinitive.
65 (o). The tense (see § 59 and R. 35-3 G, p. 66), number and person
of the subjunctive used can always bo ascertained by turning the
phrase in English before translating. Thus :
I ask him to come = I ask him that he may come
He asked me to come = He asked me that I might come
He asked us to come = Ho asked us that we might come
In Latin the infinitive is never used to express a purpose.
4


66. The commonest verbs which take ut or nS and sub-
junctive are;—
curare to lake care imperare to give orders
rogare to ask monere to advise
orare to beg persuadere to persuade 1
With imperd and persuaded the person is put in the dative.
The other verbs of this list govern an accusative.
Exercise 61.
Viva voce. Turn as in §65 (a), p. 89, and translate :
he asks me to hasten I beg the boy not to weep

books. 10. Let us beg the father to train the boy with very
great care.
PRESENT AND FUTURE PARTICIPLES.
67. The English present participle ends in -ing ; working, walking.
It is frequently used with the verb to he to form the continuous tenses,
R. 29, p. 61, e.g., he is ploughing. This is never so in Latin, and the
student must be careful to translate he is ploughing by he ploughs,
arat.
Rule 46. —The Latin present participle is derived from the
present-stem by the changes shown in the following table :
Ist amo ama-ns, -ntis loving
2nd moneo mone-ns, -ntis advising
3rd rego reg-ens, -ntis ruling
4th audio audi-ens, -ntis hearing
Rule 47. —The Latin present participle used as an adjective
is declined 1 like prudens, § 33, p. 38, i.e., ablative -i, genitive
plural -ium, neuter plural -ia. It must agree with the word
referred to in number, gender and case.
Who did not hear the shouts of Quis clamores Gallorum, fer-
tile Gauls fighting 2 bravely ? tissime pugnantium, non
audivit ?
Rule 48. —The Latin future participle is derived from the
supine-stem, § 54, p. 60, by changing the -ra into -rus. It is an
adjective of three terminations, declined like bonus. It agrees
in number, gender and case with the word referred to.
Ist amo amat-um amat-urus about to love
2nd moued monit-um monit-urus about to advise
3rd. rego rcct-um rect-urus about to rule
4th audio audlt-um audit-urus about to hear
1 But when the present participle is used in the ablative absolute
(to be explained later), or when used as a noun, e.g., a Sapiente, by a
philosopher, the ablative ends in -e.
• The present participle can be used in this sentence because
“ fighting ” means “ while they were fighting.”


To the slave atout-to-fight the Servo pugnaturo dux gladium
leader gives a sword dat
They are ahout-to-carry the Aurum in templum portatur!
gold into the temple sunt
Rule 49 —Unlike the present participle, the future participle is often
used with the verb to be to form a tense 1 referring to the immediate
future.
The girl is about to. give a flower Puella sororl florem
to her sister. datura est

68. ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOICE. 1
(а) Active. The farmer ploughs the land.
(б) Passive. The land is ploughed by the farmer.
When the Verb shows what the Subject of the Verb is or does it is
said to bo in the active voice.
When the Verb shows what is done to the Subject of the Verb it is said
to be in the passive * voice.
Rule 55.—The Latin present tense of the passive means
that the action is still going on, not completed. Thas-v—
Puer laudatur = the boy is being praised.
Similarly the imperfect lauddbdtur means that the action was going
on, not completed, at a given past time, t.e., he teas being praised,
69. In translating into Latin care must be taken to ascertain the
exact meaning. The letter is written means the letter has been written,
and it must be translated by the Latin perfect (R, 67, note, p. 107),
Exercise 60,

agricolae terra vastabatur. 4. Si bellum erit elves ad anna
1 Some grammarians only apply the term active to transitive verbs.
They then speak of intransitive verbs as being neuter.
4 Passive means suffering, from the Latin potior = to suffer.

tum frumenti (R. 22, p. 53) embus dabitur. 7. Virl peri-

delectabamini. 10. Nos superabimur quod via hostibus
raonstratur.
B. 1. Soon the victory will be announced to the Romans.
2. The flowers were being carried into the temple. 3. Why

lands will be ravaged. . 6. Great forces are being given to the
consul. 7. The fields of good husbandmen are ploughed in
winter. 8. You, Claudius, were blamed because our plans
were being announced to the enemy. 9. Swords are being
given to the slaves, 10. You, 0 Gauls, will bo overcome by
(R. 13, p. 29) the Romans, your towns will be given to tho
victors.
Rule 56.— The Latin perfect participle passive is obtained
by changing the -m of the supine 1 into -s.
PEES. TENSE. SUPINE. PEEF. PABT,
am-3 am-atum am-atus having been loved
culp-5 culp-atum culp-atus having been blamed
Verbs for practice : Give the supine and perfect participle (with
meaning) of laudo, vulnero, vasto, aro, dolecto, orno, monstro, supero,
portd, convooo, pard, nuntio.
Rule 57.—The perfect tenses of the passive voice are made
up of the perfect participle and the verb sum.
70. The perfect participle is an adjective like bonus, and it must
always agree in gender, number and case with the word it refers to.
1 § 54, p. 60. The supine of first conjugation-verbs is obtained by
changing the -o of the Ist person into -dtum.; am-o, am-stum ; calp-O t
culp-atum.


SINGULAR. PLURAL.
Puer amatus est Pueri amati sunt
Puella amata est Puellae amatae sunt
Consilium laudatum est Consilia laudata sunt.
Note.— The Utter has been written means that the writing is com-
pleted. If we say the letter is written it means the letter has been
written ; and just as the active perfect scripsit means he has written or he
wrote-, bo the passive perfect means has been or was written.
Epistola scripts est 1 The letter has been written or was written

B. 1. Com had been given to the allies by the consul.

1 Sometimes the perfect participle passive is used, with or without
the verb to be, purely as an adjective, e.g., doctus, learned ; paratua,
ready. Ex. 69, A. 3, p. 87.


(R. 40, p. 80) we shall not be overcome. 4. In that battle the
consuls had been wounded. 5. The temple was adorned with
many flowers. 6. The matter (= res) has been announced to
the consuls. 7. We have been called together, friends, because
the state is in great danger. 8. Why were you blamed, foolish
boys ? 9. They were carried into the house by the sailors.
10, The dangers had been avoided by wise plans.
Rule 58.—The perfect participle passive is often used as
an ordinary adjective, without the verb sum, to describe or
distinguish a noun with which it must agree in number,
gender and case.
Girls, adorned with flowers, Puellae, floribus brnatae,
were carrying the statue into statuam intemplum por-
the temple tabant
Note.—Order o! words.—ln phrases like adorned with flowers place
the participle at the end of the phrase, and place the whole phrase im-
mediately after the word it qualifies.
Rule 59. —A participle used in this way very often corre-
sponds to a complete clause or sentence in English.
The citizens of the city which- Gives urbis expugnatae in
had-been-stormed were in magno periculo erant
great danger
Here which-had-been-stonned is equivalent to stormed.

laudavit ut domus bene aedificetur (R. 36, p. 66).
B. 1. Let us prepare flowers that the temple may be
adorned. 2. The leaders, called * together by the king, were
hastening into the city. 3. The leader calls together the slaves
who-had-been-set-free. 4. They prepared gold that it might be
given to the consul. 5. The land, ploughed *in winter, will
give {= offer) corn in summer. 6. The spear, pointed * out by
the soldier, had wounded many [men]. 7. Do not be foolish
that you may not be blamed. 8.1 took care that the dangers
might be avoided. 9. Boys, praised *by masters, will learn
many things.
71. **• A very common error is to mistake a perfect participle for a
finite 1 verb. “ Having been ” can always be prefixed to a perfect
participle passive. Thus, called means having been called.
1 A finite verb is so called because it is limited by mood and person.
The verb infinite, made up of the infinitives, participles, gerund, gerun-
dive and supine is not so limited.

masters by the boy.
The masters are obeyed by the Magistris a puero paretur

each tense, an infinitive and a gerund. They do not have a personal
subject in the nominative. If the verb is used in the perfect passive the
participle is always neuter.

APPENDIX I.
IRREGULARITIES OF DECLENSION.
1. First Declension. — (a) The dative and ablative plural of
dea, goddess; filia, daughter, end in -abus, c.g., deabus, etc.
This is to distinguish these words from the corresponding cases
of the masculine, e.g., filils, to the sons ; filiabus, to the
daughters.
The same rule is sometimes followed, especially when a distinction of
sex is necessary, with a few other words, e.g., liberta, freed woman ; mula,
she-mule.
(6) An old genitive singular in -as is found in paterfamilias,
father of a family; acc. patremfamilias ; plur. patresfamilias.
This form, which is sometimes written in two words, is also used
with mater, Jilius and filia, e.g., materfamilias.
2. Second Declension. —(a) The genitive singular of words
ending in -ius and -ium sometimes contracts -%% into -I.
(6) An old genitive plural in -um is sometimes used instead
of -drum, especially with names of coins, weights and measures,
e.g., sestertius (a coin = 2Jd.), genitive plural sestertium ;
decemvir (member of a committee of ten), decernvirum.
(c) Deus, god, has vocative deus ; nominative and vocative
plural di (del) ; dative and ablative plural dis (dels) ; genitive
plural deorum, or deum.
3. Third Declension.— (a) Bos (masc. or fern.), bovis, ox,
has exceptional forms; genitive plural, bourn ; dative and
ablative, bobus or bubus.
(6) luppiter (= lou + pater), Jupiter, has Acc. lovem, Gen.
lovis, Dat. lovi, Abl. love.
(c) Vis (fern.), farce, in the singular has only accusative
vim, ablative vi. In the plural it changes its meaning and is
declined throughout: vires (mostly) physical strength, vires,
virium, viribus, viribus.

clined :
