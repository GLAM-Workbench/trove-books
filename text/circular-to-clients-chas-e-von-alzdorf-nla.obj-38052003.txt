Wellington, New Zealand, July 18, 1846.
Since the arrival of our new Governor, Captain Grey, a system of government, widely different from that adopted
% his predecessors, has been introduced. An attempt has at last been made to put settlers in possession of land, with which they
have for upwards of six years been tantalized. The intruding natives in the Hutt district have been driven off by a demonstration
of arms; and though consequent events have proved, up to this date, most lamentably disastrous to the Settlement, they have,
nevertheless, insured to us an ultimate, and I trust, a speedy settlement of our differences with the natives as regards the land question.
These events have been of such a nature, that an abandonment of the new, or a relapse into the old system, is rendered totally
impossible. Yes, we may say that we have arrived at an alternative, according to which the British Government must either maintain
this Settlement by means of a strong military force, or abandon it, as far as systematic colonization is concerned, entirely: for,
without the most efficient protection, cultivation can no longer be carried on; and the means for importing the necessaries of life
being completely exhausted, our settlers will have to look for their daily bread elsewhere. It can, however, not be expected that
any government will for a continuance suffer their soldiers to be slaughtered?their authorities scorned and defied?colonists to be
murdered repeatedly?their houses plundered, and laid in ashes?their cattle stolen, maimed, or killed?their crops destroyed, and
the whole district rendered so insecure by a comparatively small number of savages, that no place but the town, and scarcely that,
is considered safe. Our case being thus desperate in the extreme; from the acts of our new Governor, the impression I
have of the character of the British Government, and the forces at its disposal, I cannot otherwise conclude, but that the rebel
natives will be put down speedily and effectively, and a sufficient military force stationed here, to restore confidence and establish
security.
From this conclusion, I expect the time at hand when the exertions of a Land Agent, which have hitherto in this colony been
confined in very narrow limits, will be allowed a wider scope, and when they may produce beneficial results for owner and tenant,
as well as for the colony generally, provided certain clauses contained in most powers of attorney are abandoned ; and if, in consi-
deration of the immense distance at which an Agent here has to act, the fullest discretionary power is granted him.
For your guidance in your future proceedings regarding your speculations in New Zealand, and in the valuation of your
land, I beg to press upon your most serious consideration the following paragraphs :
1. That innumerable good opportunities for letting land advantageously are lost, from the want of power to let beyond a short
term, and the power to purchase,* at a reasonable rate, ?the maxim here being now established, that no man with common sense
would, after so much distressing experience, undertake the work and expense of clearing, building, &c., without it.
2. That a man desirous of going to work cannot wait a twelvemonth or longer for a decision from England ; and that very
few indeed can be persuaded to go to work meanwhile, repeated cases having shewn the imprudence of doing so.
3. That there are eleven hundred sections of land to let in this Settlement, with a small population, which is not likely soon to
increase.
4. That there are immense districts of fine land open, where the natives are friendly disposed, and settlers of any class may
squat, and occupy large tracts of land with much accommodation, for a comparatively trifling consideration.
5. That native chiefs offer to farm labourers and others to colonise their own districts, and grow wheat in partnership with
them.
6. That the new Settlement of New Edinburgh is springing up in our neighbourhood, holding out great inducements to our
settlers, upon terms adopted after experience of above six years in colonisation.
7. That after such experience, country land here, with the exception of some early and choice selections, is considered worth
little, while the labour to be expended on it is considered worth much; and that both will be considered so until such labour has
rendered the land valuable.
8. That in the North, near the seat of Government (besides the large quantities of land which the Crown had given grants for
previously in that neighbourhood), purchases of above 100,000 acres under Captain Fitzroy's penny-an-acre proclamation have been
confirmed by Governor Grey, which now, with the advantage of a Crown-title, are in the market at less than a quarter of the cost-
price of your lands, as yet without a title.
9. That from the importation of grain and flour from old established countries, where the field is worked with the plough, and
under innumerable other advantages, the farmer here, who has to clear the forest, and for many years to work the land with spade
and hoe, takes his produce on bad roads to a spoiled market, where the natives, whose wants are few, and whose clearings are
immense, can always undersell him in potatoes, and compete with him in wheat, which circumstances together render it difficult
for him to earn a mere living.
? N.B.?The powers of Attorney left me by Mr. Hughlings are sufficient in every respect, if according to the difficult circumstances of this
place, and the particularities of cases, a liberal interpretation is allowed, as hitherto, to meet exigencies too manifold to be provided for in a power of
Attorney.


10. That the greater part of this country, and the best land in it, the forest land, is fit chiefly for people of the labouring class,
who clear the forest with their own hands, who never bring any cash in their accounts, and never account for profit and loss as long
as they earn their living, and perhaps, by hard work, have added some little comfort to it; ?a proof of this assertion is, that all
persons here who have been farming with capital have lost it, even when on their own lands; and all, with a very few insignificant
exceptions, have given it up in despair. The cause of this you will find in my remark above, which is closely connected with the
disproportion of wages and value of produce in this market.
11. That it is your first interest to foster the interest and to encourage the industry of those most useful producing settlers who
have no land, and who consider their fortune made when they have a bit of land their own, if only in the prospect of a purchasing
clause; ?that without you do so, your own interest cannot be advanced without the most extraordinary freaks of fortune, as without
population, which is constantly decreasing, most of your land here will not be worth the taxes which are threatened to be imposed
as soon as a Crown-title is granted.
12. That with regard to valuing your lands, we are here?where we have been watching for upwards of six years the fluctuations
of the value, or better of the price of land?where we have been able to observe the true causes of such rise or fall?where an intimate
acquaintance with the most minute circumstances of all such causes aids us?here on the spot where the plain truth stares us in the
face ?we are, as a matter of course, in a better position to judge the value of land in this colony than you can possibly be at such
a distance, where the puffings of speculators, and statements of individuals or bodies deeply interested, misguide you, and have
inflamed the minds of many proprietors to the most extravagant imaginations, which are the greatest enemies to our progress, and to
your interest, and which are still vigorously alive in many letters lately received by me from different quarters, after so many good
and true informants had returned from this colony to England.
If I am permitted to offer such advice, as in my humble opinion I conceive practicable, it is?that you should allow your
Agent to let the country land with liberal purchasing clauses, or to sell them without delay at the best prices that can be obtained,
even with moderate interest on the cost-price (choice sections, of course, always excepted). Sections in the distant districts, lam
afraid, will only under extraordinary circumstances realize the cost-price, because of the vast tracts of unsurveyed land surrounding
them, as well as those in all other districts. After thus a population is fixed in the surrounding country, the town lands would in
time increase in value proportionally with the increase of population ; and therefore, if you are desirous of speculating further in
land here, I would advise you to reinvest the proceeds of the sale of your country lands in town lands, carefully picked, when
favourable opportunities offer.
To accomplish such sales and reinvestments, opportunities must be seized when they offer; and it is therefore absolutely
necessary that you should employ an Agent in whose capacity and integrity you would have the most unbounded confidence and
reliance, ?without which at such a great distance your Agent, bound to refer to you, is generally too late, and can neither do any good
for you nor for himself. If my view of affairs here should meet your desire for truth, and its unpalatableness not bias your
judgment, I have no doubt that I shall be honoured with your confidence further on, and that you will also meet cheerfully the
proposals I have to add for my own interest.
I have as little desire to impose upon you a tax without a proportionate advantage gained by me for yourself, as, I am
sure, any fair-minded Proprietor can wish to gain great advantages through my exertions, without a proportionate remune-
ration for the same. With regard to the percentage on money-receipts, lam perfectly satisfied with the arrangements made with
Mr. Hughlings when here, i. e. 10 per cent, on all rents and interest on mortgages, and 5 per cent, on all purchase-moneys, &c. But
in other instances, where the Proprietor gains very great advantages, and where my attention and exertions are most required, I am
entirely without a remuneration. It is customary here to let country lands from three to four and seven years at a peppercorn rent,
in consideration of the task of clearing the land, which, with a hundred-acre section, calculated at .�'l2 per acre (the lowest average),
amounts to �l2O bond fide increased value of the section. To see that the clearing clauses, and other covenants connected with
them, are fulfilled, is the Agent?s duty, and a more troublesome and lasting one than to write receipts for rents, or even attend suits
for the same. I beg of you to consider that the most populated district, and one of the nearest, that of the Hutt valley, is nine miles
distant, and that an inspection there requires at least one whole day, and if more, causes expenses likewise. Yet the Agent is expected
to attend this without a consideration; and as it might happen that, after the leases are got, and the clearings completed, the
Agent might for some circumstance or other be discharged, he would go unrewarded for all bis labour through years, and be placed
in the position to see another break the fruit off the tree he has planted and nursed. This position is not a desirable one for any
prudent man, and too crying a grievance not to attract your attention, and not to convince you of the necessity of a fairer arrange-
ment. The same reasons are applicable to buildings, fencings, &c., on town land.
I therefore propose the following amendment to the above-mentioned terms?that country lands made arable (brought under
cultivation) should be valued at �l2 per acre (the lowest average at which land can be cleared), and the Agent to receive 10 per cent.,
as if the value had been received in cash, such percentage to be paid out of the first rents received; but in case the Agent should
be discharged from his duty for whatever reason, then such percentage to be paid on such discharge. The improvements on town
lands to be valued by two competent persons, and 10 per cent, to be allowed to the Agent at the termination of the lease, 7| per
cent, if the Agent be discharged after three quarters, five per cent, if half, and 2J if one quarter or less, of the term of lease be

expired at such discharge ; and further, two guineas for every lease made by the Agent, of any quantity of town land, if the Agent
he discharged at any time before half the term, and one guinea if he be discharged at any time after half, and not the whole, of the
term of such lease be expired ; and provided always that such leased town land is built upon, and productive of a fair rental. And
further, two guineas for every whole country section leased, if the Agent be discharged at any time before half, and one guinea if
half, and not the whole, of the term of such lease be expired, and so proportionally with half, and down to one quarter of a country
section, whether leased to one or more tenants, and provided always that such lands are let on equitable terms, and are, after the pep-
percorn term is expired, productive of a fair rental. The spirit of these terms, I believe, cannot fail to impress you with the belief
that the Agent proposing them is desirous of exerting himself to the utmost for your benefit, but that at the same time he wishes to
be equitably rewarded for his exertions.
With regard to correspondence, I beg to remark that but very few opportunities direct to England have lately offered from
this place, and that letters consequently may have been considerably retarded. To clients with whose property, from the state of
this Settlement, best described in our papers, no progress could be made, to whom I had nothing to communicate, but that their
lands were still unlet, and unproductive, I have written few letters, as I did not consider it worth the postage ; but where any
thing at all was to be done, I have been on the alert, and whenever any thing worth reporting resulted from my attention, I have
reported it; and whenever rents to a remittable amount have been received, they have been promptly remitted. For the future, under
the proposed new arrangement, I propose to address every one of my clients once a-year regularly, in a circular, describing the
state of the Settlement, its progress, and its prospects, and at any time without delay whenever any thing of any consequence affecting
your property, or the affairs of our colony in general, should occur; and whenever there is any thing to communicate to indivi-
dual clients, or monies to remit, such to be done by the first opportunity that offers, as 1 have done ever since these agencies have
been entrusted to my management.
I have yet to state, that Agents here have often to hear great abuse of their clients, for not empowering the former to sub-
scribe to public improvements to be made, particularly roads, to which the poorest labourers subscribe, or contribute labour; and I
must add, that many sections in the neighbouring districts would be tenanted, if roads had made them accessible. If you were to
allow your Agent to subscribe ever so little, it would much allay the vexation so repeatedly expressed by resident owners and other
colonists.
Finally, I have to make an appeal to your charity for two widows, Mrs. Gillespie and Mrs,
victims to Maori revenge for taking possession of land after the savages had been driven off, and for a most resp\?.j\fe>ble and indus-
trious man, Mr. D. M'Hardie, a most exemplary tenant of mine, who, with his wife and children, has been robbed of nis aA'. J
have requested Mr. Harry Hughlings and Mr. Thomas Parkinson of Halifax, in Yorkshire, to receive the mite your sympathy may
award them.
Anxiously awaiting your decision, whether you have accepted or rejected the terms I have found it necessary to propose, I
must add, that I should be sadly disappointed if, with such terms as I propose, you should find it necessary to appoint another
Agent in my stead ; but that, though in such case 1 should, with many properties, lose all the fruit of my exertions during the last
two years, and with some during treble that period?it would, nevertheless, be better for me to put up with the first loss, than
further to employ my time in a business which, in many cases, holds out no hope of remuneration, and in other cases, even
where the strongest motives for such hope exist, always with a most unrefreshing and anxious uncertainty. Whatever may be your
decision, I beg you will accept my warmest thanks for the trust 1 have been proud so long to enjoy.
I remain, Sir, with due respect,
Your obedient humble Servant,
CHAS. E. VON ALZDORF.

Wellington, New Zealand, Sept. 9, 1846.
P. S. ?During the time my letter had been delayed in the Press, affairs here assumed so favorable an aspect, that I considered
it advisable to delay it a few weeks longer, after which I expected to be able to communicate to you more important news; and I
have now the great satisfaction to add, that Rangihaeata and his followers, after having been driven from one stronghold to another,
have at last been dispersed; and many from starvation, in a most miserable condition, have been taken prisoners. Te Rauparaha and
some of his petty chiefs are also prisoners on board H.M.S. Calliope, where it is expected he will be kept long enough to lose bis
inclination to disturb us any more :we may say the war in our neighbourhood is at an end. I say, in our neighbourhood, because
it is generally feared that the revengeful and blood-thirsty Rangihaeata, as long as he is at large, will strain every nerve to collect
another force, and attack settlements which are as yet unprotected, and surprise, rob, and murder outsettlers. This appears yet
possible, from the doubtful and suspicious disposition of some tribes on the Manawatu, Rangitiki, Wanganui, and Taupo, They
have ever declined to join our native allies against Rangihaeata, and have shewn a suspicious reserve, and even contempt, against the
former on every occasion. However, by the defeat of Rangihaeata, and the capture of Rauparaha, the spell by which they formerly
could raise an army at a call is broken; and if the natives adhere to their old customs, these chiefs are degraded, and their influence
lost.
The new roads from here to Porirua, opening the west coast, and up the valley of the Hutt, opening the Wairarapa district,
are in rapid progress ; several bridges and buildings have been contracted for by Government, and this expenditure, together with that
of the military and naval force collected here, are the only sources from which we get any money into the impoverished place. The
acts of our truly good and amiable Governor Captain Grey, and his sympathy shown to the settlers, have inspired the latter with
new and relying confidence, and the labouring men are scrambling for a piece of land with a power to purchase, and they are
putting in wheat wherever there is a cleared patch. The Phoenix is struggling to rise out of its ashes ! It wants a little aid from
the Absentee Proprietors, and it will rise to the sun ! But without this aid, the struggle will be beyond its strength, its efforts will
be unavailing, and it will only fall to the ground in its ineffectual attempt to fly.
In conclusion, I have to correct an error into which I had been led by an Auckland newspaper :?The purchases of above
100,000 acres under Captain Fitzroy?s Penny-an-acre Proclamation, referred to in paragraph Bth of my letter, are not yet confirmed
by Captain Grey. Applications, however, for Crown Grants to that extent have been made to Government by the purchasers under
that act.
