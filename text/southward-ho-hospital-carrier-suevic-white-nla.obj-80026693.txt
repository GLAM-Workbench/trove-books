Southward - Ho!
FOREWORD
Just a few lines as an introduction to
our little paper. I am indeed honoured
by this privilege.
What can I say? It almost borders
on impertinence for me to attempt this
with you, who have gone through so
much during the past three years. Dur-
ing this eventful period I have been
employed in ?cushy ? jobs in sunny
Australia, while you have been bearing
the full brunt of war?s terrible storm
and stress. Anything I say cannot
appeal to you so directly as if it came
from one who had shared your risks
and difficulties at the Front. So please
accept this, my apology, and pardon
what may appear to be presumption on
my part.
Permit me now to thank all ranks for
their loyalty and support during the
past four weeks. You have been called
upon to accept many discomforts while
passing through the danger zone, and
one and all have responded cheerfully.
Of course, there have been cases of
grousing, but those indulging in this
have only exorcised a soldier?s preroga-
tive.
The good feeling existing between all
ranks has made my job an easy one,
and certainly belies the statement, so
freely made by those who do not know,
i.e., ?That Australian troops will never
be well disciplined.? For more years
than I care to remember, I have been
connected with the Australian Defence
Force, and since the fatal month of
August, 1914, I have been in close touch
with high-spirited men in camp and
elsewhere. I, therefore, claim the right
to state that my experience proves that
tha Australian soldier is always prompt
and ready to obey, and his devotion to
duty is rarely surpassed by regular
troops.
When thinking what the past three
years have meant to thousands of Aus-
tralians, one cannot help but wonder
what effect the lessons, so sternly learnt,
will have on the future. You, who
have been through the terrors of hell,
must have a message for those who
remained at home. May it be one that
will make for the betterment of all
classes and have a sobering effect in our
nation?s domestic and political life.
Individual effort will be of little avail,
and you must use your combined
strength. The medium to do so is al-
ready provided in the Returned Soldiers?
Associations which are formed in each
State. Every man returning from the
Front should join this Association.
Work to keep it free from parochial and
parish pump politics, having always the
welfare of returned soldiers in view.
While many of you are returning to
take up positions that have been kept
open for you, always remember that
many, many more will be looking for
jobs. Here the Associations are doing
good work, and as time goes on so the
necessity for this work will grow and
the difficulty of placing men will become
harder. With all ranks combined, the
difficulties of the future should be largely
discounted, and promises glibly made
when you enlisted will be fulfilled.
Above all things, pull together, the for-
tunate ones helping as far as they can
their less fortunate comrades. Act on
the sentiment so aptly expressed by
Australia?s poet:
? Life is mostly froth and bubble,
Two things stand like stone ?
Kindness in another?s trouble,
Courage in our own.?
1 wish one and all success and pros-
perity. You deserve it. May your
future be bright and happy, never again
troubled by war?s alarms.
P. H. MEEKS, Lieut.-Col.,
O.C. Troops A 29.

EDITORIAL.
The object of this little book is to
serve as a souvenir of this voyage on
the ?Suevic.?
It has no literary ambitions, but, with
very few exceptions, the contents have
been written by men on board.
This opportunity is taken to thank
all those who have helped, in any way,
and the generous response to the call
for contributions is very much appre-
ciated.
The cost of production and also the
shortness of time in which to have it
produced at Cape Town have, of course,
made it absolutely necessary to keep
the volume within certain limitations.
It has been a great pleasure to com-
pile it, and if, in years to come, it may
remind one of old times and associa
tions, then, also, the time spent on it
will not have been in vain.
The Eternal Question.
My Own Darling,?The time has come
when I must ask you a question?one
which has caused me many a sleepless
night, and many an anxious day.
This is a question which I have hesi-
tated to ask anyone else; many a home
has been broken up, and many a bright
life ruined over the same trouble.
You will no doubt be surprised at
my approaching you, but in my distress
I must know the truth. I know that
you will appreciate my mental anguish
and that you will understand that my
troubles are yours.
I beg of you, darling, to put aside
all your own cares and pleasures, and
devote your whole time to earnest con-
sideration of the question I am about
to ask you. Answer it carefully and
after mature thought, always remem-
bering that it is between you and my-
self only. This is the question: ?When
is this war going to end? ? ?Your
own,
PHILLIS.
Second Nature.
Every soldier in France is really a
hero, but it is not always so easy to
impress one?s family with this fact.
A Erench soldier, whilst lying in
hospital recovering from wounds he had
? received by sitting on a hand grenade,
which, although it disabled him, was
the means of saving his comrades, and
for which he was duly decorated, re-
ceived the following letter from his
mother:
?My Dear Jules, ?I am not surprised
to hear that you have been decorated
for sitting on a hand grenade, as I
have never known you to do much else,
except sit down all your life.?

My Estaminet.
There?s a dirty little village on the road
to La Bassee
That I visit every morning, if we chance
to pass that way,
And the liquor that I quaff there comes
from Burton (yes, it may !)
To that dirty little cottage that?s
marked ?Estaminet.?
There?s a shrapnel-splintered doorway
where there?s hardly room to pass;
Still, it?s cosy in the parlour, with a
pint or two of Bass,
Hut the chief attraction in it is a lively
little lass,
As she smiles and takes your money ?
? Trete centimes, M?siors. par

You can drink the liquid freely, till
you?ve done in half your pay
(If it ever saw Old England, it has come
a long, long way),
For its weak and quite exhausted in
that small estaminet.
In that dirty little cottage on the road
to La Bassee.

THE RATIONALE OF THE
GREAT WAR.
It may be safely alleged, now, that
Germany desired to precipitate a Con
tinental war on a large scale, but it is
now evident, however, that she did not
at first rechon on or even desire the
active participation of Great Britain.
That could come later, but not till
Germany had Europe at her feet. Our
intervention, therefore, thwarted the
whole German military design. Had we
failed Belgium, all would have been
lost; but the German Western campaign
miscarried through our armed support.
The Germans have discovered that they
cannot wipe out ? the contemptible little
army,? and since then their attitude to
England has been one of ferocious hate,
rather more impotent than effective.
This hatred, however, is not new-born.
It has been cultivated with care by the
Kaiser Wilhelm 11., who consistently in-
sulted his English mother, whose fault,
in his eyes, consisted only in her nation-
ality. Jealousy of the position of the
British Empire has also fostered this
hatred for many years among the
German people at large. In German
opinion. Great Britain is in the position
of some great landowner who refuses
to sell his land. She possesses every-
thing the Germans want: colonies, sea
power, markets, cables, coaling stations,
naval bases; and the Germans know
that sea power is indispensable to de-
velopment, but wherever she has tried
to show her hand, English interests have
been a constant stumbling-block in her
way.
This war has threatened Europe for
ten years. It nearly broke out five times
before; yet neither England nor France
prepared after all the warnings they
received If somebody tells you ho is
going to fight you in three months, or
three years, but is going to learn box-
ing first, and still you take no precau
tions ?well, you are ?looking for
trouble,? and ?you get it.* That was
the attitude of England and France, and
that attitude was precisely what the
Germans counted on. However, they
mistook the French fighting power and
the British dogged spirit.
This war is the most terrible in all
history, and will be most fiercely dis-
puted till the end. No documents, paper
treaties, or conferences will end it; it
can only end by the military destruction
of the German race. However hard and
prolonged the struggle may be, we
should eventually obtain this, because
the three great elements of successful
warfare are with us, that is to say,
money, time and sea power, not to
speak of numbers of men. As the war
progresses, it docs so to the disadvantage
of Germany. The Allies are fighting for
liberty; the Germans are fighting for
existence. Are w� downhearted? No.
Nor have we any reason to be!
G. SIMONS,
Staff Capt., A.I.F.
There once was a girl in La Basse�
Whose face was a little bit passee;
I will not deny,
She?d a look in her eye.
But, gee whiz! What a terrible chassis.


GREATER LOVE . . .
It was at the Barracks I met him;
he was a mamby-pamby sort, a regular
?Mother?s boy.? We had gathered
there, quite a mixed crowd of humanity,
in answer to the Empire?s call. He
approached me with a genial ? Good
morning; I wonder how long they will
keep us waiting here. You know I?m
so anxious to go into training.? A
few remarks such as these brought
forth some laughter from the crowd
of recruits gathered around, one of
which said, ? Blime! who sent him to
be a Soldier? He should be at home
playing with the cat? ; and, in truth, I
was rather inclined to agree, for 1
thought he was no more suited for a
soldier?s life than a navvy is for needle-
work.
Maintaining an air of calm indiffer-
ence as he listened to his critics, he
reminded me of that well-known quota-
tion, ?A moral, sensible and well-bred
man will not affront me ?and none other
can.?
Time passed by, and, strange to say,
we became pals. He became quite a
well-known identity in our reinforce-
ment, and in course of time earned for
himself a nickname which followed him
to his battalion, everyone soon becom-
ing acquainted with the genial
? Blossom.?
?Twas after Pozieres, during the in-
terval when we were hung up at Moquet
Farm. Frozen almost stiff one day?
the next chilled and wet to the skin?
all this made no difference to my pal.
The rain and sleet failed entirely to
damp his ardour or in any way affect
his spirits.
Through the sticky, slithering, sludgy
mud we?d slowly make our way upon
? fatigue??sometimes it was rations,
sometimes duckboards; but, no matter
what it was, he never complained. He
might slip and slither, fall headlong
into the mire, but never a curse would
pass his lips?Blossom?s temper would
remain unruffled. . . .
There came a night when he and 1
were warned to go out and repair some
wire the Huns had blown away-?a
rotten job which no one envied us, the
position being continually searched by
one of Fritz?s machine guns. The
throaty crackling of this gun as_ it
traversed in search of working parties,
together with the unceasing procession
of flares, had us continually on the
?qui vive,? and were the cause of
frequent interruptions in our work, com-
pelling us to seek shelter in a near-by
shell-hole. The first streaks of dawn
coming faintly across the ridge in front
of Bapaume found us with our task still
incomplete. I was for returning to
the trench at once, but Blossom was
determined to finish the job. I argued
with him, but he insisted on remaining;
he was quite willing to stay on his
own if I cared to take the alternate
course and return, so in the face of
that argument I had to stay. All went
well; the job completed, \Ve gathered
together our few tools, slung our rifles
and made for the trench. ?Ping!?
?Ping!??we?d left it too late; a sniper
had spotted us through the gathering
grey of that chill, cold and (what later
proved to be) eventful morning.
?Down!? he cried, but before he had
spoken I was in a shell-hole up to my
waist in water, Blossom soon joining
me. There we waited, discussing the
pros, and cons, of our chances for a
safe return, both knowing full well that
every moment lost lessened our chances
of reaching the trench and safety during
that day. We eventually decided that
we would make a run for it while the
light was still uncertain.
Blossom made the arrangements. ? I?ll
go first,? he said. ? W T hen I have gone
20 yards, you follow.? There we both
waited for an opportune moment. The
machine gun having spent its bust,
Blossom moved quickly and started for
the trench some distance away. The
moment he had left, the truth dawned
upon me; this ?mother?s boy,? whom
I once thought more suitable for a
flappers? afternoon tea party, was draw-
ing the sniper?s fire in order to give
me more than a sporting chance of
getting through safely.
?Ping! Ping! Ping!? I could hear
the bullets whizzing by, but Blossom
was the target, not me. I reached the
trench, my pal just on my heels, but
it was evident from the look of pain
on his pale countenance that he had
been badly hit. He stumbled ?fell; I
caught him as he was falling.
We laid him down in the muddy
trench, only to realise that he had been
mortally wounded ?hit in the abdomen.
Slowly his hand stole to his neck, and
with painful deliberation he removed
his disc. This he handed to me, and
then endeavoured to reach his breast
pocket. I knew at once what he want-
ed, and withdrew his pay-book for him.
Slowly he turned over the pages until
he reached the one pertaining to ? Next
of Kin,? and, pointing with trembling
finger, he whispered, ? Tell?tell ?
Mother!?
DUNOON.
Bluffing It Out.
It -wasn?t Bill?s fault. He had mis-
laid his rifle in the line, and reached out
to replace -the missing- weapon on the
night we were changing over with the
relief. Also, it wasn?t his fault that in
place of a serviceable rifle he got one
festooned with mud, and encrusted with
rust, because even a good Australian
can?t see in the dark.
Back in billets the next morning. Bill
had hardly opened his attack on the
mud and rust when the order came:
?Fall in for rifle inspection!? There
was nothing for it hut to fall in, ?look
sweet,? as the boys say out there. Bill
took his place on the end of the line,
his shooting-iron held correctly at the
?port,? and a set expression on his face.
Slowly the inspecting officer advanced,
nearer and nearer, till at last he stood
before Bill, rooted to the spot at the
sight of the offending weapon.
At last he asked: ?What does this
mean, man? Have you worked your
bolt since you came out of the line??
?No, sir,? replied Bill; ?I?ve been
afraid of frightening the mice out of
the barrel! ?
SISTER.
When yer?ve finished with yer fightin?,
?Cos yer?ve stopped yer share of lead,
And the Sister comes and asks yer how
yer feel,
While she tucks yer in more comfy in
A ? dinkum? feather bed,
Yer kinder think th? whole thing can?t
bo real.
Yer feelin? pretty rotten, but feel half
afraid to speak,
For fear yer?ll wake and find its all a
dream,
But them?s yer arms and skinny hands,
shakin? ?cos yer weak,
Still things don?t seem to be just as
they seem.
Yer move yer right leg slowly, for yer
lyin? on yer back,
Just to see yer limbs are workin? down
below,
But yer left, yer cannot shift it, well,
it must have got a smack,
Seems a funny thing to say yer didn?t
know,
There?s a feelin? in yer ?Bingy? that
makes yer want ter ?heave ? or
burst.
But yer know its goin? to hurt yer if
yer do;
Th? taste of Krupps is in yer throat
and a forty horse newer thirst
Withers all yer vitals through and
through.
Yer ask a drink of water, and the
Sister from afar? ,
She?s a hefty smilin? daughter of th?
South ?
Shakes her finger as she tells yer:
?Now, remember where you are,?
And yer can only have a drop to rinse
yer mouth.
Then yer eyes they lose their focus and
the sunlight turns to brown,
Black depression creeps on yer like a
pall,
Yer sinkin?, but yer fightin? for yer
chance as yer go down.
While yer wonder if its worth while
after all.
And whenever bombs and rifles cracked,
with machine gun?s rapid fire,
Wherever Britain?s heavy guns have
roared,
Sister?s- work of mercy?s done ?she never
seems ter <tife,
And God alone can give her just award.
?TAVAGO,?

London reports state that this season's
kangaroos? eggs are hatching out well,
and that the yield of the world-famous
? kangaroo fevvers? will therefore be
very fine.
Several very fine treacle springs have
also been discovered, and large pump-
ing plants are being erected.
That men are working overtime in
the cheese quarries, and large Ship-
ments are expected to arrive in London
soon.


ANZACS.
What mean these great white ships at sea, ploughing their Eastward tack,
Bearing their mangled human freight, bringing the spent men back?
They mean that Australia has been there, they mean she has played the game
And her wonderful sons have won their share of everlasting fame.
Battered, and worn, and war scarred ?those who had left their land
Strong in their glowing manhood, by England to take their stand;
Those who have sailed, when the war cloud burst, out on a distant foam
To the tune of ?Australia will be there??thus are they coming home!
What mean these absent numbers, the gaps in the stricken line?
You will find the graves which tell you. on the trail by Lonesome Pine:
On the slopes of Aki Baba, on Koja Chemen?s brow,
They died the death of heroes, as Australia?s sons know how.
Eager for battle they leapt ashore at the cove where their name was won,
They stormed the cliffs of Sari Bair, where the death trap gullies run;
In the lead-rent scrub by Krithia, on the banks of Kereves Dere,
High on the shell-swept ridges?Australia has been there!
There is silence on the breaches now, the battle-din has fled
From the gullies, cliffs, and ridges where they charged up, fought and bled,
There?s a little cove that?s sacred?north of Gaba Tepe Hill?
To the glory of the men who died, and a name that never will!
There are great white vessels sailing, and they bear the joy and pain.
And the glory of Australia?s sons who have not bled in vain;
Tho? crippled, helpless, maimed for life, tho? more than death their loss,
There is more than life in the glory of the burden of their cross.
Greater than jewel-decked Emperor, greater than ermined King,
Clad in their faded suits of blue, the men that the white ships bring;
What tho? their crown a bandage, stretcher or cot their throne,
Splints or a crutch their sceptre ?the Anzac name is their own!
When our wonderful tale of Empire is written in far-off days,
Not least from its glowing pages, a little name will blaze;
A little name will echo in the paean of our fame.
In the glory of our annals, there will live the Anzac name.

BLIGHTY! GOOD-BYE.
A Last Impression.
It is a clear morning, but the air is
crisp and keen, and has the bite of
autumn in it, for the sun is not yet up.
But the camp, even at this early hour,
is fully awake and moving, and there
is much bustle and noise, for a draft is
just moving off, homeward bound to
Australia.
Back to ?Aussie? at last, so the long-
looked-for day has arrived. That one
which has ever been prominent in our
thoughts since the one, on which was
left behind the dear land of our birth,
and we sallied forth upon that long,
unknown road of Duty.
The Draft has already fallen in on
the road facing the Depot Orderly
Room at Monte Video, and it is a par-
ade that is full of pathos, and one can
well imagine the thousand and one
thoughts that must be flashing through
those who are present.
Glance along the ranks and look at
the motley crowd.
Colours of every unit in the force
catch the eye, for here are men from
all branches of the service.
Men with arms in slings, and those
who carry heavy sticks for support, and
there are those, too, who, though they
bear no outward sign of disablement,
tell, by their drawn faces, the same
story of self-sacrifice. There is grim
humour in it, when the order comes,
? Parade, ?shun! ? Then quickly fol-
lows, ?Move to the left in fours,? the
band strikes up, and the long, long jour-
ney Home has started.
And, as we march along in the early
morning, with the green fields on either
side of the hedge-bound road, covered
with a thin mist, there surely flashes
through the minds of all, memories of
the happy times spent at ? Monte ? and
Weymouth.
On our way through the streets to-
wards the station, many a man, and
many a girl, too, stand on the pave-
ment and call, or wave a last good-bye,
and now and then one runs out and
places a farewell gift in the hands of
some man.
At Weymouth Station the train is
quickly loaded, and Colonel Spencer-
Browne, the genial Commandant, stops
at each carriage to bid a last good-bye
and God-speed.
?Were moving,? remarks somebody
by my side, and the long train draws
slowly out of the station to the strains
of ?Auld Lang Syne,? played by the
Depot Band.
So Weymouth is left behind, a place
that must always have pleasant memor-
ies for those who have been lucky
enough to stay for a space at No. 2
Command Depot.
The broad sea Front, the Gardens,
the good friends we made, and the
pretty girls we left behind will often
pass through the mind of many a man
as he crawls along the dusty track be-
hind a mob of sheep, or wakes the
echoes with the ring of his axe in the
far-off bush.
It is a lovely day, and as the train
speeds on her way the picturesque
country of Dorset and Devon stretches
out, broad and fair to look upon. Let
us look well at this, the last we?ll see
of Old England, for a while at anyrate,
for it is very beautiful to-day in the
clear sunlight, and one forgets the rain
and the cold that so utterly depress us,
and see only that great charm, that soft
touch, that God and Man and Time
only have given to the land of our
forefathers.
One need not waste space over the
troopship, for she is much like any other,
but she has this great point in favour?
she?s going the right way.
? Where are you going for Christ-
mas? ? calls out a sailor from a vessel
alongside.
Then somebody makes the inevitable
?Coo-ee,? which is quickly taken up on
all sides. And as we steam slowly down
the harbour, the band on board a
cruiser strikes up ?We all go the same
way home,? and not till then, perhaps,
does one fully realise it all.
Feelings are, and must be, mixed, for
though we are homeward bound there
is a wrench at this parting from the
Old Land. From our pals we are leav-
ing behind to ?carry on,? and from
the many, many friends we have made.
But deep down in our hearts is ring-
ing the word ?Australia,? and the bush,
the station, and the old home, wherever
it may be, all seem very near again,
and in our minds we are once again
meeting face to face with our dear ones
who for Australia?s sake were left be-
hind so long, long ago.
?The London lights are far abeam,
So we drive her through the haze,
Towards the land we left behind,
Towards the Land of Never-Mind
And the old Australian ways.?
?KHIVA.?
To Scotland.
Fair land, farewell!
Thy rugged shores, grey, seagirt, free,
Dark mantling woods and heather hills
Where foaming burns leap to the sea,
Or flow through peaceful dells and rills
Where Nature?s beauty grandeur thrills
Fair land, Farewell!
Brave land, farewell!
Thy strong, deep breast, 0 Motherland,
Has nourished Britain?s bravest, best,
Whose blows fell fierce at Right?s com-
mand,
Or gladly yield each faithful breast,
To wounds or death at love?s request,
Brave land. Farewell!
Sweet land, farewell 1
The love-lit glance of maiden fair,
Is thy best gift: by Angels taught
?Tis fir from Heaven, pure and rare
In distant lands my dreams are fraught
Of glance and smile from sweet May
caught,
Sweet land, Farewell 1
IT. CLARK, Corpl.
A.I.F.
LAST DAYS AT WEYMOUTH
For weeks we had been on the tip-
toe of expectation, each day there were
rumours of a boat-roll to-morrow,
eagerly we watched our S.-M. as he
came on parade, to see if his hand
held the long expected roll. But many
times we were disappointed. . At last,
when one day he came, surrounded by
sergeants, we knew by the excitement
among the latter, that the long expect-
ed had arrived.
For once, at least, the S.-M-. had our
undivided attention.
He commenced to read: ? The follow-
ing men will answer their names and
fall out in front, they will be on J
carrier.? We each waited expectantly
with, ? Here, sir ? on the tip of our
tongues; but we were doomed to dis-
appointment, our names were not
called; in tfio vernacular of the troops
we had ?come a gutser.? We went
back to our hut, cursing our luck. For
a week we waited each day expecting
L roll, then on a memorable Monday
the S.-M. commenced: ?The following
men will constitute L boat roll. ?Pri-
vate Blank.? ?Right!? ?You?ll be
right in the clink if you don?t answer
properly.? For two days we were on
parade incessantly, medical kit and
other inspections following one another
in quick succession. Then on one event-
ful morning we rose at three, ipartook
of a hasty breakfast, and fell in at day-
light. There was joy in our hearts as
we passed through the gates of the
station, while the guard stood at one
side without asking the familiar ques-
tion: ?Where?s your pass??
On the station we were regaled on
tea and cakes provided, I believe, by
the Red Cross, and distributed by the
Colonel?s wife (Mrs. Spencer Browne)
and a number of other ladies.
We travelled by train across Dorset
and among the beautiful hills of Devon.
It was a bright sunny day, and every-
thing looked bright and green, hence
we carried away with us a pleasant re-
collection of our last day in England.
By 4 o?clock in the afternoon we were
all on board the troopship; it was the
time long dreamed of, ? The End of a
Perfect Day.?
Next morning we weighed anchor and
slowly steamed to sea, passing en route
three of England?s old wooden vessels,
which are now used as training ships.
It was farewell to Old England, which
many of us did not leave without re-
gret.
The way we had been treated by the
ladies of ?Blighty after returning from
France will long remain in our memory.
W.E.P.
Smile awhile.
And while you smile
Another smiles,
And soon there?s miles and mile* of
smiles,
And life?s worth while
Because you smile.

?ONE ROUND CAUCHEY.?
What, not heard of One round
Caughey? Thought everyone knew the
beggar. He can?t keep his bally eye-
glass in his eye. Oh, now you know
who I mean, do you. ?Bout time you
did, too. Here you?ve been on the boat
four weeks and his smiling face and
manly form has been wandering round
the decks from morning until dark, ex-
cepting the time he spends in the hos-
pital relating his exploits to the _ ever
attentive ears of the patient patients,
some of whom had not the pleasure of
seeing him knocked out by our ?new
light of the ring? Charlie Chaplin!
It was funny. On the night of the
9th of October, 1917. It was a gay
scene. Of course they had to have a
concert first to give the ?pugs? time
to arrange things behind the scenes,
and to decide between themselves who
was to be knocked out before they came
on. And when they did. Lor?, it
looked like a troupe out to drown kit-
tens, ?cause each second came on carry-
ing a towel and a bucket of water under
his arm. Captain ? Mac? was referee,
but foolishly forgot to bring a whistle.
The promoters were Corporal Mc-
Anderson, with his celebrated ? One
Round Caughey,? and Warrant Officer
Shaw, with his newly-found prize,
?Charlie Chaplin.? Our Orderly,
Sully, seconded Caughey, and Chidley
?Arris (commonly known so by his wavy
porcupine hair. Shorts, and bareness of
clothing) seconded Charlie.
The stakes were �1,000,000,000,000.
But as they would not be forthcoming
in any case, just for the look of the
thing it was mutually agreed that
Caughey was to undergo the operation
of being knocked out.
He faced it bravely. Braver man
never stood upon a concert platform.
The seconds stood by their water
troughs in case the boxers ?flared up?
too much. And then the Tun com-
menced.
Caughey stood with arms folded and
gazed pathetically through his eyeglass
at the grinning Charlie. That eyeglass
was part and parcel of himself, in fact
it is believed he sleeps in it. Certain
sure! And then like two wild beasts
they got to work to devour one another.
Charlie tripped lightly on a match
stick which some kind officer threw
accidentally in the way of our hero?s
feet, causing him to sprawl lovingly
into Caughey?s waiting arms. (Greater
love had no man than his!) He fondled
him so much that his opponent was so
?carried away? that his feet left the
ground and he deposited himself into
the bucket of water behind him. The
round was at an end.
The seconds got to work. Our order-
ly Sully helped Caughey to clean his
eyeglass. But Chidley was a little more
considerate and gave Charlie a cigarette
to smoke, and kept it alight by fan-
ning vigorously with his towel. Time
was called ! And at it again they went,
on the second round. It was much less
exciting than the first. The two waltzed
round about each other, vainly endeav-
curing to avoid the terriffic blows,
which were, by the way, never aimed,
and only caused Charlie to back himself
on to the very discordant piano?s key-
board, which resented his personal ad-
vances by spreading upon the gentle
breezes a series of ?lost chords.? And
as Charlie was foolish enough to start
looking for them, the round was post-
poned, and seats taken again.
By this time Charlie?s hair was slight-
ly ruffled. Our orderly Sully attended
to Caughey all right, but Chidley was
absentminded and nearly forgot the
waterworks. On being reminded by
Warrant Officer Shaw, however, he
calmly tilted half the bucket, or I
should say, half the water in the bucket,
over Charlie. As it trickled down his
back and front, it caused the beggar to
sneeze so vigorously that he nearly swept
Chidley clean off his feet. Nothing
ruffled, however, that worthy, keeping
a straight and serious face, produced?
oh no, not the ?Answer,? but a comb
from his pocket, and proceeded to comb
Charlie?s hair before the third and last
round commenced. Right! Time!
And off at it they went. It lasted
exactly two hits. One, which Charlie
landed on Caughey?s offside optic, with
such force that that worthy recip-
ient of the blow revolved wild-
ly on the ball of his feet, _ and
actually got his legs tied in a
knot. While he was untying them,
Charlie saw the opening, and attacked
in the rear. And landed the second
fatal blow, the amazing knock-out,
straight at his discomforted opponent s
sea l-
One Round Caughey, trembling from
bow to stern, and murmuring sadly in
a dazed sort of undertone, ?Am I sink-
ing? ? wildly clutched the open air for
support. Failing to receive any there-
from, he sank wearily to the floor, and
was counted clean knocked out!
He was then revived by his second
Sully, who promptly tipped the bucket
of watery fluid over him. Even then
Chidley finished it off by further flood-
ing him with his wanter tank.
The exhausted Caughey came quite
quickly to life, and sat up, and spread-
ing his arms breast-stroke fashion, and
blowing water from his mouth the while,
muttered softly: ? Gee, but do you take
me for a bally whale? ?
And then they all trooped off again,
to the tune of a tremendous applause
from the audience?to dry themselves.

Y.M.C.A.
Every soldier who has taken part in
the war has learnt the value of the
Y.M.C.A., though he may not have
known much about the Association in
his pre-war days.
But since the day on which he en-
listed the Y.M.C.A. is his constant and
ever piesent friend.
It has stood by him at all times, in
the training camp, on leave, and on
the battlefield.
The war has been its golden oppor-
tunity, and the Y.M.C.A. has been able
a t i as t p U t its principles into practice,
anc ] a rea ) help to those who have
fought for God, King and Country,
The Association hopes that every sol-
djer returning to Australia will see
his way clear to enter its full member-
ship, for it is just as much the man?s
friend at home in times of peace as
when he is far away from his native
land on active service,

MEMORIES OF HURDCOTT.
It is not long since the name at the
head of this page was to most of us nn-
known. It roused no memories; it
stirred no heart. But now to many
thousands of our Australian lads this
word has its significance of joy (r
sorrow. The present writer, who for a
considerable period was Senior Chaplain
of this area, has seen Hurdcott in all
its moods, and remembers it with affec-
tion and interest. Of all the camps
scattered about that region of Wiltshire
which has so strangely received the
name of Salisbury ?Plain? (so unlike
a ? plain ? as we know it in Australia),
Hurdcott is perhaps the pleasantest
from a scenic and sanitary point of
view. It lies on rising ground along
the Valley of the Nadder, with shady
woods adjacent, and in front, towards
the south, one of the numerous long
ridges or ?downs,? fringed with a
border of hazel bushes, from which one
may pluck the sweet nuts and eat. A
gorgeous avenue of oak, elm and beech
trees traverses the north side of the
camp. Here the sun, when it does
shine, can hardly penetrate the massed
leaves and branches, which meet over-
head and form a glorious arch. But it
must not be forgotten that this is m
summer only. We saw this scene also
when the frozen ground lay deep in
snow; when the avenue was covered
with white, and when, on a breezy
mornmg, I have often seen the words
of the Psalmist realised: He scattereth
the hoar-frost like ashes.? Beautiful,
as no doubt the snow of Old England is,
we find it hard to forget the bronchitis
and the pneumonia; we cannot forget
the hapless Australian boys who died
not in the shock of battle, but by the
hand of a cold and cruel fate, and a
colder and more cruel English winter.
How well I know the little churchyards
where they lie sleeping their last sleep
where they await the reveille at the
last day. They were buried with the
honours of war; their resting-places are
m d wooden crosses, with
wo ? rd ?Australia ?in large letters
them , have been set up, ?Lest wo
V' ? were potential heroes,
had hea / kened to the call; their
thoughts, their desires were to cross the
� ? ea which separate d them from

h and y ? obbed ther � of ? ho prid e and

the of a**loll-
- placing of an Australian camp at
Hurdcott is not without historic interest,
In fact, ancient and modern are here
side by side. Not far from the modern
camp, with its ceaseless tramp of sol-
diors, the regular call of the bugle, the
noise of bombs, the rattle of musketry
fire, the ? rat-a-tat-a-tat ? of the Lewis
gun, and the various activities of the
Army routine, are ruins of Roman
camps, with fosse and vallum, from
?WHEN WE ARE STRAFED.??(2.)
which, centuries ago, the Roman legion-
aries looked out upon the valley below,
It is strange to think that on such his-
toric ground the map of Australia is
carved in chalk on the hillside,
Q ne f eature Q { the present camp is
tbe con tinual change. It may be corn-
pare<j to a huge reservoir, ever receiv-
j and ever sen( Jing part of its store to
the laco of need Reinforcements
from Australia and drafts arc
sent a ?overseas,? but the work of
training goes on incessantly, with al-
ways changing bodies of men.
J
It is not all drill, however. Theic
are regimental concerts, regimental m-
stitutes, sergeants? dances, football and
cricket in due season, battalion and
group sports. In the evenings and on
Sunday afternoons the neighbouring vA
lages of Barford St. Broad
Chalk, Fovant, Dinton and Compton
Charnberlayne are invaded by khaki,
which may be seen at village inns with
ancient signs, in parks and public
.places, in churchyards and churches, in
rectories, houses and cottages along
every street and lane in the vicinity for
miles around.
But it is a world of change, and for
many those times have ceased. Some,
indeed, who were trained have
?taken the count ? in battle against the
Hun; most of those who live will never
see Hurdcott again with bodily eyes.
Yet with the eye of the mind they will
always see it, for it has been photo-
graphed there for ever.

? GROUSIN?! ?
We been grousin? since we started
And will grouse until we?re done,
We groused first for our uniform
And then groused for a gun.
We groused because they kept us back,
We groused at the delay;
If we didn?t grouse for want of leave
We groused for want of pay.
We groused on Egypt?s burning sands
And prayed for cooling climes,
We groused at mud and rain in France
(As well grouse at these lines!)
We groused to get to Blighty
And to leave the Somme behind;
We groused when we went broke
again
On wine and never mind !
We groused while up at Per ham
Downs,
We groused for ?final boards?;
We groused when cables never came,
We groused at cobber?s hoards.
We groused to get to Weymouth,
Monte, Westham, or the Verne,
When there we groused to get aboard
As we?ve groused at every turn.
Now that wo are on our way home,
Advancing league by league.
We always grouse like blazes
When we?re asked to do fatigue.
We groused on every battlefield.
We?ve groused on ship or train;
We left Australia grousin?.
And we?ll grouse back home again.
But although we are not ?A? Class,
And well, not over fit,
If we see a way to help the mob
We?ll hop in and do our bit.
D. P.
? Our Harbour!?
Why is Sydney Harbour considered
a monstrosity ?
Because it has TWO HEADS with
a GAP between. It is very MANLY
and would astonish any FARM COVE
from the country. It has only_ been
known to have one SPIT, and is the
only COMMERCIAL CENTRE in the
world that is opened by a CIRCULAR
QUAY.


THE ? FUST LINE WACIN.?
I.
You must speak of it in whispered
tones,
In hushed and bated breath.
You must never dare to try on any
gaggin?,
For the man who?d try to drive a
place,
Will surely court his death ?
You must learn to ride to join the
?Fust Line Wagin.?
11.
Australia breeds good riders, they?re
the pick of any land,
For skill and dash you?ll find they?re
never laggin?,
But the very cream of all them, for
nerve and steady hand,
Are the men who drive and keep the
?Fust Line W T agin.?
111.
Though the limbers stick in mud till
the tops cannot be seen,
Tho? the brakes are jammed, and all
the wheels are draggin?.
There?s a team will show the way,
where never yet a team has been,
?Tis the horse and man that form
the ?Fust Line Wagin.?
IV.
You can put it where you like, and at
any time you like,
Though for want of feed the horse?s
sides are saggin?,
But I?ll lay jiist what you like,
That they?ll make the flint stones
strike,
And they?ll do or die as one?? The
Fust Line W?agin.?
V.
So heed you well, and mark my words,
For what I say is true,
Tho? other teams may do a lot of
braggin?.
For a dinkum ?Ansie ? turnout, for
a team that?s all true blue.
You must doff your caps?salute tho
?Fust Line Wagin.?
VI.
There?s young Hat Lowers from Kyne-
ton Town,
In the sunny State of Vic.,
You?ll never see him with the reins
ajaggin?,
A true and trusty comrade, who
would chance his life to stick
And drive the ? wheel ? of this the
?Fust Line Wagin.?
VII.
And young Sid Butler, nicknamed
? But,?
A beauty with the reins.
Whose whip and voice are never used
in naggin?,
No matter how the Germans shell,
no matter pouring rains.
You can trust tho ?centre? of the
?Fust Line Wagin.?
And then there?s Farmer, nicknamed
? Buck,?
He comes from Borderland,
A good ?un, too, in' spite of all his
raggin?,
He?d ride through Hell and back
again, he?s made of proper sand,
And he drives the ?lead ? of this the
?Fust Line Wagin.?
IX.
So drink a toast and fill your glass,
Yes, fill it to the brim,
And out on jealous tongues that go
awaggin?,
To the honour and the glory, to the
fame that ne?er grows dim,
We?ll drink a toast ?Long live the
? Fust Line Wagih.? ?

How to Start a Farm.
On reaching the position selected, first
choose a site for your dug-out, then
put up your wire entanglements, and
place your posts.
Place snipers in suitable positions to
keep away agents, travellers, charity
collectors, and other enemies of man-
kind.
After getting the Sappers and Miners
to blow out all the timber and other
cover, send a G.S. wagon to railhead for
the firewood.
Stack this on the dump near the
cookhouse, handy for the Cookaburra.
Now start your trenching, not forget-
ting to dig in all such noxious weeds as
A.P.M.?s, M.P.?s and take great care
that these do not get a hold of the land.
Being soldiers, you will, of course,
know how to harrow the land, after
which you may drill it. If fertilising
with Bully Beef and Biscuit, remember
always that these want well burying.
After the crop is in you may apply
for 48 hours? leave, and afterwards wire
for an extension. This leave may be
profitably spent in the Bush with your
bayonette, branding any sheep found
A.W.L. At the same time a steer or
two could be sniped, but take great care
not to draw any hostile fire, and so get
a red stain in your pay-book.
By strictly following the above ad-
vice you should be able to keep your
feet warm till the next war comes along.
A Grievance!
A grievance I would like to air.
In fact I?d like to Rouse;
It really seems a bit unfair
The noise they make at House!
LOOKING AHEAD.
Some Practical Advice.
We are going home, most of us to
stop, a very few to return, so we have
to ask ourselves: What are we going
to do for a living? Most of us will have
a few pounds to start with, and it
should be put to the best use. Some
of us will go on the land, and our
Government will give us every encour-
agement and help in their power.
Those who decide for the land must
remember the essentials for success are
energy, perseverance, and intelligence,
the chief being the last. If fruit grow-
ing is chosen, study your markets and
best kinds of fruit to grow for it, and
the very latest kind of cultivation. If
cultivation of say, chaff, potatoes, peas,
beans, etc., secure the best land you
can, cultivate thoroughly, manure
liberally, and keep a strict record of
all incomings and outgoings.
If dairying, it must be good ground
and subsoil. In starting a herd oi
milkers a good plan is to buy poddies,
or yearlings, from a person who has a
good herd, and wait till they come
into profit. When they start producing
a test and a sample of their milk should
be taken at least once a week and a
record kept. At the end of the season
these records should be made up, and
all cows not coming up to a certain
return should be got rid of. Never
over stock, and feed up to the utmost
of the most milk-producing fodder. A
cow worth keeping will pay you well
for your trouble and outlay.
This paper will not admit of discus-
sion of the by-products of dairying,
such as pigs, calves, or fowls; but from
mv own experience of thirty years I
have found it pays well to concentrate
as much as possible on the pigs.
I would like to impress on those go-
ing on the land the great necessity of
keeping books. You must know what
everythiner is costing you and their re-
turns, to work with the directness of
purpose necessary for success.
Some of us prefer the city life. To
those I would say, make a start by be-
ing your own landlord. Buy an allot-
ment in a healthy suburb and put up
your own house according to your
means.
The question arises, where? In Mel-
bourne, we find in the south, right
down to Frankston. The eastern is
densely populated and rather low lying.
The west is swampy, but the north,
past Essendon, is not only high and
well drained, but the price is reasonable
too. The writer knows of several
allotments between Broad Meadows and
Essendon that can be secured from
10s. to �1 per foot, and in his opinion
must increase in value within a reason-
able time.
�250 should not only buy you an
allotment, but put up a house of a sub-
stantial nature, that could be added to
later on, and surely that is worth while.
Make no mistake, while in rented pro-
perty, your landlord will not forget on
Monday morning to call for his 12s. 6d.,
155., or �1 per week rent.


HOW TO BECOME A
SUCCESSFUL SETTLER.
Perhaps there is no political problem
occupying the public mind in Australia
to-day more than that of ? What to do
with the Returned Soldiers?? It is
never too soon to look well ahead, and
as there are many amongst us on board
our good troopship (A.29) who will
never see the fining line again the
question vitally affects us. No doubt
the State Governments will loyally stick
to the platform promises of three years
back, and see to our welfare to the very
best of their ability and knowledge.
It occupies the thoughts of every loyal
Australian who has not seen service, be-
cause he recognises the great sacrifices,
the hardships, that his brother country-
men have endured for the sake of their
homeland and those whose ties at home
have prevented their voluntary enlist
merit; it also occupies the shirker?s
mind, because he will be afraid the re-
turned man may be getting just a little
too much. Again, it occupies ours, to
a far greater extent. Many are return-
ing in impaired health, many more
crippled, maimed for life, and will be
permanently unfitted to ?carry on ? in
their former trades or occupations.
No man can estimate the value of
three years? hard service or its equiva-
lent in cash on the bloody fields of
France or Gallipoli.
Not a sane man in the army would
give one moment?s thought to the paltry
6s. per day for his service. But he has
faithfully done his duty, defended the
homes and honour of Australia, and
placed her on a pinnacle among the
nations of the world by deeds of daring,
by his unconquerable spirit and bull-
dog tenacity that has won the unstinted
praise and plaudits of the Commander-
in-Chief and the prominent military
critics of the day.
The question is, naturally, owing to
all trades having a representation, a
very Comdex o:ne.
Australia has one big asset, of which
she can and will give freely. There is
land, land and still more land; not in
its hundreds of acres, but in millions.
And wo can rest quite assured not only
land will be given but every assistance
absolutely essential to develop it also. I
am penning these few lines hoping I
may be able, with twenty years of prac-
tical and successful farming, to assist
some who are inclined to launch out,
not into the wilds and back blocks of
Australia, but into the fine wheat belts
of Riverina, which have already been
earmarked by the N.S.W. Government
and are already linked up by railway
connection or bordering the main lines.
Limited space prevents me dealing
with more than one particular class of
land, so I must avoid what a good many
would prefer, that is mixed farming or
dairying, where a greater rainfall is
required and heavier land, such as the
north and south-east coastal districts
of N.S. or Gippsland and western dis-
tricts of Victoria, where root crops and
dairying are carried on so successfully
and extensively.
Referring again to the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment, they have already, on the
Yanko Irrigation Settlements, fenced
the boundaries and built suitable home-
steads, and in many cases advanced
sums of money to prepare the land. But
far greater assistance will be given!
especially to those with a clean military
record. There are still millions of
acres with a good average rainfall
where crops are certain as it is possible
to be, and are equally good for orchard
or vineyard. Any man, therefore, who
wishes to live the remainder of his
days (even without previous knowledge
of farming) need only to be careful and
persevering under the conditions stated,
and become a prosperous farmer,
gradually surmounting all the little
difficulties by experience. He will not
require a greater banking account than
�3OO. More would be better, of course,
more is always better, but I could quote
hundreds who have started with far less
than half this amount in positions of
affluence to-day.
I will here give in detail his practical
requirements for twelve months, also
approximate returns.
Expenditure.
Four horses �lOO
One plough, �3O; one set Har-
rows, �lO 40
Necessary furniture for home ... 80
Two cows 15
Laying out orchard (100 trees)... 5
Living expenses 60
Total �290
Profits.
100 Acres of wheat at 15 bushels,
a low estimate; at Govern-
ment price, 4s. per bushel... �3OO
Profits from grazing, balance of
land 30
Total �530
It will be understood the Government
is providing seed, chaff and manure
for first year. No interest on value of
land or loans is charged for first three
years. During time between the sow-
ing season and harvest the prosperous
farmer would fallow another 100 acres,
and on a 500 acre farm would never
have under crops less than 200 acres.
It will be seen by comparison of
profits and expenses that the settler
already, with the low estimate of 15
bushels per acre, has all his stock paid
for and �330 to commence the second
year. He will now be well in hand
and be able by his keen business acu-
men to effect a few necessary improve-
ments ?lay out a little in stock, com-
mence breeding his own horses and
other stock. The ensuing harvest finds
him with two hundred acres in, double
the preceding year s returns. He will
be able to pay the small sum of 5 pbr
cent, levied by the Government on the
capital value of his land and other
loans. At the end of 33 years the land
becomes his own. All he requires is
tact, push and principle to become in a
few years a prosperous farmer.
He will always find willing agents
ready to deal on easy terms for his
machinery, if cash is not convenient,
for they know their money is sure.
Sometimes it will be found to be a
great advantage to work in conjunction
with a neighbour, to each other?s mu-
tual benefit. In any case, before many
years he will be rewarded for his en-
ergy and foresight by a gradually
swelling banking account, with a com-
fortable home, by a smiling, contented
wife and happy children, ever ready to
listen around the home fireside at
night the tales of ?what daddy did
in the great war.?

?THE TEN COMMAND-
MENTS.?
AS INTERPRETED ON THE A 29.
1. Thou shalt not worship at the god
Chance. Two-up thou shalt not play;
neither Cluff Poker, Banker, nor Crown
and Anchor; but Housey-housey thou
shalt be allowed to play, and call out
in a loud voice: ?Kelly?s eye,? ?Clik-
kety click,? and ?Top of the Wasser.?
2. Thou shalt not pinch thy neigh-
bour?s hat; and if thou hast already
done so, thou shalt immediately return
it unto him and thus brighten his days
on earth.
5. Thou shalt not eat of the forbidden
fruit, i.e., thou shalt not buy from the
natives pineapples or bananas, neither
cocoanuts nor vegetable marrows; for
beneath their rosy skin of thin exteriors
lurk the deadly germs of malaria, hydro-
phobia, influenza and mal-de-mer, ready
to dash out on their unwary prey.
4. Thou shalt not revile thine Officers
for going about at Sierra Leone. They
but obeyed the dictates of their hearts.?
5. Thou shalt not invade the Sergeants?
presence between the hours of 6 p.m.
and 6 a.m. For it is written that the
sheep shall not consort with the goat,
neither the ox with the ass.
6. Thou shalt not hurl thy abuse at
the heads of the Anzac Provost Corps
and liken them as roaring lions seeking
whom they may devour. They do their
duty according to their ideas of justice.
7. Thou shalt not confound the names
of Anzac and Australian. Between them
is a great gulf fixed: one is a super-
man, the other but common clay.
8. Thou shalt wear thy pyjama
suits, and not hoard them up and
gloat over them as a miser does his
gold.
9. When thou gettest paid thou shalt
see the amount in thy hand coincides
with the amount in thy book.
10. See that thou obeyest these com-
mands, or thou mayest linger long in
the Clinque to ponder over the error
of thy ways.

Da Boys at da front they are play a da
game,
And ebbera where you find it da same;
On da land, up in da sky, or on da sea,
All rush to da spot where a they hear
the ?Coo-ee?!
They use a da baynet, yet with plenta
da strength,
And give Hun and da Turk full a da
length;
If ebber da man was due a da praise,
It?s da one from Austra-da-Laish.
Now I think a da Boys they had a da
nuff,
But nebber one says its da hotta da
stuff;
So iback-a-da-up and play a da game.
And give a da chance to getta back
again.
I come a da end, my last a da verse,
My a-pen, I fear, it a do its worse,
So here I da stop with a da shout and
a da hail
For the boys of good Old Austra-da-
Ail.

Troop Deck Competition.
The competition among the troop
decks for the smartest and best kept
deck has been very keen, and great in-
terest has been taken by all concerned,
the result being that all the decks have
been beautifully kept and reflect much
credit on the troop deck N.C.O.?s and
the mess orderlies, who have put in so
much time and hard work on their
tables. The judging right through has
been no easy task, and in some cases
the scoring was very close. ?B? Deck,
which wins the first competition, has
been a picture of cleanliness, and Sgt.
Gove is to be congratulated on his good
work. The scores are: ?B,? 95; ?F,?
87- ?A,? 83; ?E,? 80; ?D,? 87, ?C,?
75.
Hadn?t Time.
It was during the height of Fritz?s big
attack on a certain Division near
Langnicourt. Everyone was shooting
and yelling, and eighteen pounders and
H.E.?s roared continuously.
Mick stood on the bank of a sunken
road, his eyes blazing and his mouth
agape, hurling Mills bombs into the
advancing mol) like one possessed.
?Mick, you idiot,? roared an officer,
?take the pins out.?
?Ter the divil wid the pins,? howled
Mick, ? let the divils take them out
themselves. Oi haven?t time.?
?Passed by Censor!?
?My own Dear, Darling Duck.
Dorothy.?
?The only ship that Fritz can?t sink
is the Censor-ship.?
? The Censor is a pest, and should be
classified with chats, bugs and poli-
ticians.?
?Excuse shortness of this letter, b t
there?s a stricture on our writing.?
?Dear Mother, ?I am in hospital
dying with dysentery. . . . Hoping you
are the same. ?
? Have you read ? Alice Through a
Looking Glass???
? This voyage is very monotonous,
but will end much sooner than we
think, I hope.?

An Appeal.
If you could anti-date a week
You surely would have had a squeak
About the ? Missing Shilling ? !
But that?s all o?er, now leave ashore
Is what our nappers filling.
When at the Cape, for our good name
We tell the Head we?ll play the game
Why? Arn?t we Homeward Bound!
Men that play the game too low
Their mates will up and tell them so
In language strong and sound;
So we hope the Heads will show no
fear
To grant us leave this trip
I?m sure they?ll find all quiessketeer
With all aboard the ship
No man you?ll find will absent be
No drinks will be on view,
For if a man has had enough
He?ll simply say ? Na poo ? !

? What?s the matter with you, my
man?? said the M.O. at the Medical
Board. ?Oh, bad sight, is it. Well,
what?s this?? (holding up a two franc
piece).
?Please, sir, I can?t see it.?
? Can?t see it, eh! That?s bad, very
bad. Can you see this?? (holding up
a tin plate).
?Yes, sir, 1 can see that; it?s ?alf a
franc. ?
?You?ll do.? smiled the M.O. ?If
you take that for half a franc, you?ll
take Prussian Guards for bantams!?
How Can I Comfort Thee?
How can I comfort thee, dearest friend?
What can I say? What can 1 do?
Ever my nearest and dearest friend.
One of the faithful few.
Can I not share, if I may not bear.
All thy great load of care?
Gladly I?d go to the world?s far end
To bring thee relief, O friend!
Oh, let me comfort thee, nearest friend;
Lean on my heart, give me thy hand.
Wilt thou not follow me, dearest friend,
Into a fairer land?
Out of the Valley of Tears and Woe,
Let us arise and go;
Let us together the hills ascend ?
Sunshine is there, dear friend!
?(Copied from a Letter.)
FAREWELL.
Farewell to the shores of England,
Though it?s pleased we are to be
Bound for Australia?s sunny clime,
And putting out to sea.
But into our heart comes stealing
A feeling of deep regret,
When thinking of friends wo are
leaving?
Friends that we can?t forget.
Friends that will never forget us,
Though we are so far away.
Who will look for our returning
And for our welfare pray.
Farewell to the shores of England
But wo hope in a future year
To receive another welcome
From friends that we hold dear.

? Medicine and Duty.?
If you go down to our M.0.,
It is a special treat,
You get the best attention,
His manner?s simply sweet.
He can cure the vilest headache,
And the toothache can dispel.
Our sick parade is always big,
For chaps not feeling well
Can have attention gratis free
From our M.O.?s Dispensary.
Though your head may ache awhile ?
M. and D.,
P?raps you?re suffering from bile?M.
and D.,
Hammer toes, flat feet or flu.
Fits which turn your features blue,
Our M.O. will pull you through?M.
and D.
He can question every patient.
And will diagnose each case.
Make a very big distinction
?Tween trench feet and swollen face,
Number nines and other ?kill-me-
quicks?
Are given liberally,
And you can?t complain about the cost,
Because there is no fee,
The M.O. with his numerous pills
Can kill or cure you of all ills.
But invariably it means ?M. and D.,
Note the flourish of his pen?M. and D.,
And for scabies, infatigo,
Just the same wherever I go
On the sick report it starts?M. and D. !
?But not on this ship!? Editor.
The Nurses.
They greet you in the morning
When you waken ?with a smile,?
There?s nothing ?too much trouble,?
There?s nothing ?not worth while.?
They watch you through the daytime,
And attend your slightest wish;
And if your face is drawn with pain,
They murmur then, ?Mafeesh.?
They come and wash your hands and
face,
And smooth your pillow down.
And if you don?t feel comfy then,
It makes their faces frown.
They straighten out your draw-sheet
To ease your troubled sore,
There?s not another on the earth
Could do for you much more.
And always in my memory
The brightest page will be
The weeks I spent in hospital,
\nd nurse attended me.

I Don?t!
The padre tells rne not to smoke,
So I don?t!
Or listen to a naughty joke,
So I don?t!
He made it clear I must not wink
At pretty girls, or even think
About intoxicating drink,
And I don?t!
To dance or flirt is very wrong,
And I don?t!
Wild youths chase woman, wine, and
song,
But I don?t!
I kiss no girls, not even one.
In fact I don?t know how it?s done,
You wouldn?t think I have much fun,
Well, I don?t!
