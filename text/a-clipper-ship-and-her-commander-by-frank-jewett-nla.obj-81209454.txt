The years 1830-33 were the romantic period of
the United States Commercial Marine. It was
before the days of cables or of transcontinental
railroads or of inter-ocean canals. Iron was but
little used in marine constructions, and steam
vessels were employed mainly in coastwise service.
The discovery of gold in California in 1849, and in
Australia in 1831, created a demand for vessels of
increased size and strength, and, especially, speed.
There was a rapid evolution in shipbuilding to meet
these requirements, resulting in the famous extreme
clippers which greatly abridged the long passages
around � the Capes �, especially important for
passengers and mails, made our country re-
nowned for nautical achievements, and created a
general public interest and excitement similar to that
shown over the present International yacht-racing.
There are many living who can recall the enthu-
siam with which were greeted the exploits of the
Flying Cloud, the Hurricane, the Sea Serpent, the
Sovereign of the Seas, the Nightingale, the Flying
Fish, the Westward Ho, the Comet, the Lightning,
the British Challenger, and others of similar class.
My purpose is to tell the story of a passage in the


Nightingale. She was an extreme clipper, built at
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1850, by a Swe-
etish count, named Hanscom, for exhibition at the
World?s Fair, in London, in 1831, and named the
Nightingale in honor of his countrywoman, Jenny
Lind, then in the zenith of her fame ; and the figure-
head was a finely carved bust of Jenny Lind, an
admirable likeness.
In the construction of the Nightingale only tht,
best materials were used, live oak and locust and
hard pine. In port she wore mahogany belaying
pins in her rails, which were replaced at sea by
stouter oak. Her rigging was capped with brass,
highly polished; her rail was finely carved and
gilded; her cabin was finished in mahogany and
satinwood ; her rigging was a-taunto, and her decks
were holystoned, as on a man-of-war. At sea she
was equipped with all canvas possible to be carried;
including skysails, staysails, outer jibs, and
stun?sails in successive suits. In all waters, as she
lay in port, she was the object of frequent inspection
and admiration. I remember in London showing
Dickie Green over her, clear to her keelson, with a
lantern, and the comments he made on her speed.
He owned three hundred ships afloat in all waters,
and used to say every morning that he did not care
which way the wind blew it was fair for some
of his boats.
Her first voyage was on the famous � tea and
silk � course, between Shanghai and London, then
employing the fastest ships afloat; and a race was


arranged between her and the British clipper
Challenger, from Shanghai to London, stakes of
two thousand pounds being placed by their respec-
tive owners on the result. The Nightingale was
defeated, and her commander, chagrined at the
result, and being somewhat in years, resigned,
leaving the ship in London Docks, in charge of the
chief officer, and took a Cunarder home. The
owners of the Nightingale, Messrs. Sampson and
Tappan, Boston, made light of the pecuniary loss,
but greatly deplored the lowering of the flag, and
immediately arranged another race, for similar
stakes, between the same vessels, over the same
course. After consultation with Commodore R. B.
Forbes and other leading shipowners, Captain
Samuel W. Mather trained and rapidly advanced
by Commodore Forbes, who greatly appreciated
him, then about twenty-nine years of age, of
New England birth, and familiar with the China
seas, was chosen to command her. Her passage
out from London to Angier Point, Java, at the
mouth of the China Sea, was by far the fastest ever
made. On her return from Shanghai, over the
contested course, she beat the Challenger to the
English Channel by more than a week. The inter-
national maritime competition, now pursued in
sport, was then conducted in sober earnest by the
largest, fastest merchantmen, along business lines,
for nautical supremacy for commercial advanges.
In the spring of 1833 the Nightingale, still com-
manded by Captain Mather, because of her speed


and general record was chartered by the Australian
Pioneer Line, R. W, Cameron and Co., to carry
mails, passengers, and freights to Melbourne, with
the understanding that she was to proceed from
there to China ports, where she would load with tea
and silk for London. The gold fever in Australia
was reaching its height, and the Nightingale s
accommodations were speedily taken.
Lieutenant Maury, then in charge of the Hydro-
graphic Bureau, Washington, had projected his
� great circle � theory for shortening the Australian
passage. The Cape of Good Hope lies in latitude
about 33� south, and for generations the China
traders, in doubling the Cape, had done so between
parallels 3 7� and 40�. Here the winds and currents
are light and baffling, from the east, making the
China passage to the eastward proverbially long
Melbourne lies in about 37� south, and it was
natural for the Australian traders, in establishing
their routes, to do so in the old China � lane �,
between 37* and 40�, meeting adverse winds and
tides while doubling the Cape.
Before the Nightingale?s passage, the shortest
time made by any vessel under canvas, from any
Atlantic port to Australia, was over ninety days,
and steamers averaged over seventy. Lieutenant
Maury said that that was all wrong that the true
way to reach Australia was to keep clear of the
African coast, avoid � the Cape �, and make at
once for high latitudes, say, parallels 33� to 60�
south; that there the mariner would find strong


counter currents of both wind and water, the meri-
dians of longitude short, and instead of delay from
light and baffling easterly winds and currents, he
would be borne swiftly along by strong, steady
westerly winds and currents till he reached the
meridians of Australia, and then could make his
latitude to Hobson Bay. In short, � the longest
way round was the shortest way there �. It seems
surprising now that, from the very scant materials
then available, Lieutenant Maury should have so
accurately and confidently laid out his (( great
circle � route and predicted its success. Only
three vessels, I believe, had left any record or
passage reaching above 30 south, prior to our time.
Commander Wilkes?s expedition had made one,
and so, also, had one German and one Frenchman,
but the materials furnished by them toward any
solution of the problem were very slight. Lieuten-
ant Maury and the Department were very solicitous
to have the route tried, and they enlisted the
Nightingale in the undertaking. Lieutenant Maury
personally solicited Captain Mather to try his
� great circle � route, and offered him all his works
and maps, and the government nautical literature,
to aid him in making the projected passage.
The Nightingale left New York harbor, May 19,
1833, with twenty first-class passangers besides
myself, over one hundred second-class, mails, and
freights of every commodity required by a pioneer
civilization, provisions of all kinds, wheelbarrows,
wagons, shovels, hoes, clothing, and nearly every


kind of general merchandise. She was officered
by as able, experienced men in their respective
ranks as ever trod a deck. Her captain was consi-
dered, by shipowners at least, to have no superior
in his profession. The chief officer, who had been
in command formerly on other ships, was much
older than the captain, had seen much service, and
was a typical � sea dog �. The other officers were
of similar ability and record. She carried a very
full crew. We followed Lieutenant Maury?s
instructions literally, avoided the African coast
and � the Cape �, and made at once for high
latitudes, till we reached parallel 57� south. We
were seriously delayed by calms and baffling winds
about � the line �. After we crossed the 45th
parallel south, there was a perceptibly stronger
wind and current from the West, and after Crossing
the 30th these greatly increased in strength. At
this point, with the temerity of the ship that carried
the Ancient Mariner, we plunged into unknown
seas, but his epithet � silent � could not be applied
to them. On the contrary, to an imaginative mind,
the billows, perilous and unexplored as those which
menaced Vasco da Gama when he essayed to round
southernmost Africa, well might seem to lift up a
foreboding voice, and, like the Spirit of the Cape
which rose between sea and sky to warn the
Adventurer back, to call on us to return.
But, in our case, � unseen hands were pushing
us behind �, and after crossing the 35th parallel,
and all the time we were above it, we had a gale of


wind, and a current that alone, as we estimated,
sent us ahead at the rate of six knots an hour. The
4th of July I wore a heavy watch-coat and boots;
the snow fell on an average over one foot in depth;
the air was filled with sleet and snow; the at-
mosphere was gray, the horizon close, the wind
blowing a gale, but steady for days. We carried
only the three � courses � and three topsails, the
main topgallant sail, spanker, and inner jib. Our
speed was terrific. By patent log and reckoning
both, we made over sixteen knots twenty statute
miles an hour, a mile in three minutes, under
short sail.
At an earlier stage of the passage the crew had
generally surmised and said that the captain, so
young, and looking even younger than he was,
must have married the owner?s daughter, or he
would never have been given, at so early an age,
so fine and important a command; but the owners
had been prudent enough to surround him with
some old sea dogs, for safety.
in parallel 37�, in the dog-watch, four to six P. M.,
when the chief officer came on deck to relieve the
second officer, he swiftly cast his eye toward the
horizon in the direction of the wind, then at the
struggling canvas, and particularly at the main
topgallant sail, which threatened every minute to
blow away. As nautical etiquette forbids the
officer in charge to alter canvas when the captain
is on deck, without his command or consent, the
chief officer, after his hurried survey, said, � Cap-


tain Mather, that main topgallant sail is laboring
very hard �. (( It is drawing well, let it stand,
Mr. Bartlett �, was the reply. At six o?clock,
when the second officer in turn relieved the first,
he also gave a rapid glance about, and said, � Cap-
tain Mather, that main topgallant sail is struggling
hard �. (( It holds a good full, let it stand, Mr.
McFarland �, was the reply. Even the old sea
dogs among the crew begged the petty officers to
send them up to take in sail, while it was held safe
to do so. As the helmsman turned his wheel,
every turn of a spoke would make the ship jump in
the water like a frightened bird. Men were sta-
tioned at every belaying pin, holding halyards and
clew lines by a single turn � under and over �,
ready to let go and clew up, at a signal. We were
making a record passage, and sail was to be carried
to the last minute, the utmost the ship could bear,
while every exigence of storm was anticipated.
Later in the evening the captain could not help
asking if the crew still thought that he had married
the owner?s daughter. Captain Mather illustrated
then, as always, a quality of mind usually exhibited
by those who succeed in almost any direction,
an extreme daring and extreme caution running
parallel.
The weird atmosphere of such a situation,
especially at night, is difficult to be imagined or
described. In July to be clad as in the cold of
midwinter; to look out on the steel-gray air, thick
with sleet or blinding snow; to look up to a starless


sky ; to feel shut in by a closely circumscribed dome
and horizon; to watch the huge, racing waves
furiously shaking out their foam and spray; to feel
the steady on-bearing impact of the swift rushing
current, hurrying unobstructedly like a resistless
fate, wide round the globe ; to be dinned by the in-
cessant roar of the sustained gale; to see, but not
hear, the night-watch, muffled against the rigor of
the cold and storm, moving like ghosts ; to hear the
grinding roar of the cordage and the report like
artillery of the bellying sail as it occasionally
flapped; to feel the fierce, bodeful, almost human
leap of the ship, as she answered to the shifting
wheel; to realize that you are in unknown waters,
on untried routes; that, in case of disaster, there is
not the slightest chance for rescue, these are
sensations, once experienced, never to be forgotten.
On approaching Australian meridians of lon-
gitude we changed our course to north by easterly,
heading for Cape Otway, which, on the south shore
of Australia, a little west of Hobson Bay, cor-
responds to Melbourne harbor about as Fire Island
does to New York harbor. As we emerged from
the region of gloom and storm, we ran into longer
days, clearer skies, and balmy air, till we had
been out about seventy-five days, when, at nine
o?clock one evening, the captain came down to his
cabin, where I happened to be. He seemed in a
brown study. Soon he blew his silver call for his
boy, and told him to call Mr. McFarland, who was
to have the second long watch, twelve to four


o?clock, from midnight. When he came, the
captain said to him, � Mr. McFarland, I wish to be
called at twelve O?clck to-night, I expect to
make Cape Otway Light �. It did not vary three
minutes from twelve O?clock, chronometer time,
whem McFarland knocked at the captain?s door,
and said, � Captain Mather, revolving light two
points on port bow �, We both rushed on deck,
and there was Cape Otway Light, first light, then
dark, and our passage was virtually over.
We had not seen land since we left Sandy Hook,
had sailed over twenty-five thousand � sailing
miles �, over unknown waters, and made our
objective point within three minutes of the calcu-
lated time. This was only one of many routes
pioneered and shortened by the Nightingale, and I
have been told by most distinguished naval officers
that the routes of the Nightingale are considered
classic in the United States ? Navy, and are now
generally adopted for sailing vessels.
From Cape Otway to Hobson Bay was a short
run, and we were soon in Melbourne harbor.
The were then no docks or wharves at which ocean
vessels could land, and we anchored some four or
five miles out, forming part of a large fleet of
various nationalities swinging at anchor. Our
unprecedented passage, over such an unusual route,
created great excitement. There was hardly more
in New York city on the first successful laying of
the Atlantic Cable. The time for passengers and
mails from the United States had been reduced


from ninty-two days to seventy-five, and our cap-
tain was feted by leading officials and merchants.
Except for the delays at the Equator, our time
would have been well below seventy days. We
had hardly anchored when the entire crew, unable
to get ashore as planned, refused duty, mutinied.
They had shipped to get a free-paid passage to the
gold fields, and their chagrin and anger were great
on finding their plans baffled.
Our signal was swiftly raised for the captain of
the harbor police, who at once came on board, and
learning the situation, summoned the official police
tugs which took the crew to the prison hulks in the
harbor, the only prison or places of confinement,
I believe, which the city then afforded. The ship
was then put in the hands of stevedores. Our only
means of communication with the shore was by
our own small boats. The captain?s gig of the
Nightingale soon became known as the fastest boat
in the harbor. With six oars steered by a
coxswain she fairly flew. As I was the
youngest, a boy in the teens, and the lightest
in weight, the tiller was usually given to me, and
I remember few more exhilarating experiences than
those � pulls � between the Nightingale and the
Melbourne shores.
The rude piers were thronged by people of more
different nationalities than I have elsewhere seen
in any one locality, and the confusion of tongues
would have done credit to Babel itself. Not only
men from the various European countries were


gathered there, but Turks, Greeks, Chinese, East
Indians, Malaccese, in varied, picturesque costu-
mes. Melbourne was then very quaint and pri-
mitive. I used frequently to go up to the city,
passing through � Canvas City )) a city of tents
only on the way, and I recall that I used to pay
a dollar and a quarter for a chop and a cup of coffee,
very poor and poorly served. The city proper was
built mainly in low brick constructions. Ido not
recall any building of more than two stories in
height; nor any, unless two or three public
buildings, that in our country would have cost ten
thousand dollars. The air was fine, and dry even
in the harbor. The activity and excitement gen-
erally were characteristic of mining enterprises.
After we were discharged and ballasted with
stone, we ran up the signal again for the harbor
police. The captain of the police came aboard,
and when he learned that he was summoned to
return our crew, he remonstrated kindly, but
seriously, with the captain. He said, � I beg you,
Captain Mather, not to persist in your demand. I
have never seen men so angry, bitter, revengeful,
they say, and I believe, that they will never turn
to; more than that, they threaten to kill you if com-
pelled to sail �. The only reply was, � I want my
men ; they shipped for the voyage to Australia,
China, Europe, and return �. To the further
earnest protest of the police captain. Captain Mather
simply repeated, � I want my men; they are good
sailors; I cannot replace them here except at


exorbitant rates, and perhaps not at all. I want
my men �. To the renewed predictions ot danger
the answer was the same : � I want my men; 1 will
take the risk of my life, and I will risk my ship,
you command the harbor police 1 want my
men �. Seeing that more parley was useless, the
police captain sent the men from � the hulks �,
under charge of the police. They came on board
in irons; sullen, angry, bitter. The police captain
said ; � Here are your men, Captain Mather; what
will you do now? � � Fly the signal for the tugs,
Mr. Bartlett �, was the only response. The tugs
came up and took our hawsers. The anchor was
raised, a few light kites were unfurled and set, and
we were under way for the port of Hong Kong,
through the Indian Pacific and the Bashee Channel
separating Luzon from Formosa.
It was a gloomy prospect, putting to sea with a
crew in irons. I asked the captain, � Are you
really determined to leave harbor, and put out to
sea, in this condition? � � Yes �, was the ansver.
� What will you do when we get outside? �
� Wait till we get three leagues from land, outside
British jurisdiction, and see �. The tugs took us
outside, and soon the headlands of Hobson Bay
were disappearing from sight. Fortunately, a few
of the men, finding themselves in open sea and in
danger, turned to before getting actually out of
sight of land, and in two or three days they were
joined by a majority of the crew. In less than a
week all but one had returned to duty. One man


remained in irons, in confinement between decks,
till we reached Hong Kong, where he was handed
over to the authorities. After the men had reported
for duty, I asked the captain what he would have
done if the men had held out. He said, �It would
have been mutiny, and probably I should not have
had to shoot more than one or two; then the rest
would have turned to �.
As we reached the northeastern coast of Australia,
the phosphorescent effects were wonderful, espe-
cially at night. I used to read without difficulty
at twelve O?clock midnight, on deck, any ordinary
type, unaided by artificial light. From nine to
twelve at night we used to play checkers on deck,
till sometimes it seemed as if I moved the men in
my sleep. Our wake was a broad band of
burnished gold, clear to the horizon. I would
hang over the bow to watch the golden spangles
as they were thrown up by the ship?s bow, as she
met and parted the waves; and every wave-cap.
over all the broad plain of waters, was a diamond
point.
After leaving the Austrialian coast we were in
smooth seas and light steady breezes, carrying a
cloud of sail the three � courses �, spanker,
staysails and jib, the three topsails, topgallant sails,
royals and skysails and stun?sails alow and
aloft. The Nightingale was more like a bird in the
air than like a craft afloat. We had only one sharp
squall on this passage, and I do not recall a finer
sight than watching the captian as he stripped his


ship, while he stood on the weather side of the
quarter deck, holding with one hand to the mizzen
rigging, sweeping with rapid glance the ship, each
sail, the furious seas, and driving blasts. His
commands were given in swift succession; the
helm was shifted at his word; the sails seemed to
furl as birds close their wings, while now and then
he was blown out, off his feet, horizontally, like
a ribbon, still holding by a firm grasp with a single
hand to the rigging. With the exception of this
squall, our entire passage of nearly forty days was
over smooth seas and with steady, light winds,
making about six knots an hour; floating lazily by
day under skies of ever deepening blue; at night,
beneath moon and stars of dazzling brilliancy,
over seas of burnished gold, soon reached
the Caroline group, and the captain, with charac-
teristic initiative, determined to pioneer a new route
between the islands, where, according to the charts,
navigable channels ran. During the day, as we
neared the islands, we were surrounded by small
boats with outriggings smaller boats suspended
from levers extending ten to twelve feet from the
main boat, on each of which a man rode to balance
the narrow craft. The boats were filled with
natives of both sexes, clad only with a tight cloth
about the waist. Ido not believe that finer forms
were ever seen, such pictures of health, vigor,
and alertness. They had fishing tackle, and a
variety of fruits and vegetables and of works in
coral. Their talk was a peculiar guttural, like the


quack-quack of the Malays. They made signs to
be taken on board and to trade, but we concluded
to keep on and not to let them board us.
At eleven o?clock at night, while the captain and
myself were engaged on deck in our usual game,
the second officer, Mr. McFarland, came up
excitedly, and said, � Captain Mather, there are
breakers ahead �. The islands had been visible
for a day or so, and now were not far distant on
either hand. We went to the bow, and looked and
listened. The roar of the breakers was as audible
as that of the surf on the south shore of Long Island.
The night was clear, and the light of the moon and
the stars was brilliant. The wind had almost died
away, the canvas was full spread; the sails hanging
idly, occasionally flapping. We soon found that
a very strong current was setting us in rapidly
toward the breakers, and that the wind whoIF/
failed to help us counter it. We at once equipped
two large boats with stun?sail halyards for tow
lines, manned the boats with six oarsmen each, and
lowered them from the davits. They instantly
took hold of the ship, and the twelve oars were
vigorously pulled. With the utmost exertion of
the oarsmen for hours, the ship only swung round,
head on to the current, and the men could barely
hold the ship steady. With the aid of the glass
we saw thousands of natives at points on the shores,
evidently waiting for our approach, and expecting
disaster. They were reputed to be cannibals, and
our chances were discussed with considerable


interest. The captain, then in reduced flesh,
assured the chief officer, unusually plump and
fleshy, that he (the chief officer) would be roasted
and carved first, and that he (the captain) would be
kept a while at least till they could fatten him. We
generously passed down good Jamaica rum to the
oarsmen and encouraged every exertion. After
several hours of toil and tension, a breeze a
blessed breeze, a favoring breeze sprang up,
filled our sails, and enabled us to claw off, and
slowly round the southern islands of the group.
Some thirty days had passed before we sighted
Luzon, the northernmost island of the Philippines,
and the Bashee Islands, through which we sailed
into the China Sea. We soon made the Limoon
Channel, and sailing through it was gliding through
fairyland. The bold, wooded, mountainous
shores, opened up by the tortuous channel, afforded
continuous surprises, and, as we came from open
sea, a bewilderingly magnificent prospect. Our
pilot was a Chinaman in full Chinese costume,
wearing his pigtail; and to hear and see him give
orders on such a craft, to such experienced seamen,
was a novel experience. The port and city of Hong
Kong are too widely known to justify detailed
description. Its selection and seizure were charac-
teristic of English sagacity and not excessive
scrupulousness, when, as William Black says,
� England was young and healthy. If she wanted
anything she simply took it. Now she is getting
old and nervous, and asking if this is right �.


It was a far cry from Melbourne to Hong
in 1833-34, somewhat like going in earlier days
from Omaha or Denver to Boston. Hong Kong
was the most highly developed of all British foreign
ports. The fleet at anchor, was unusually nume-
rous, and represented the finest ships of the com-
mercial marine of all civilized nations. It was the
port of entry, and of distribution, which brought to
it the <( racers � of all nationalities, to draw the
prizes on the famous lea and silk routes. The
army was well represented; so was the navy.
Hong Kong?s bishops were palatially housed; the
Chinese service was silent, efficient, and automatic.
The foreign captains, every day in fresh white linen
suits, the brilliant uniforms of army and navy, the
picturesque native costumes, all presented an
animated spectacle.
Orders arrived at Hong Kong, after several
weeks? delay, for the Nightingale to proceed to
Whampoa and take a cargo of Chinese merchandise
from there to Shanghai; and accordingly we sailed
for that port. Whampoa is about thirty miles
below Canton, and is really the port of entry for the
latter city, the nearest approach that commercial
vessels can make to Canton. Our comprador kept
us supplied with choice fruits, fine vegetables, and
rare flowers. There I first learned the great dif-
ference in quality and flavor between tropical fruits
served in northern climates and those served in the
climate where such fruits are raised and ripened.
We were always surrounded by acres of �sampan)> >


small squarebowed boats, witb bamooo-arched
coverings that telescoped into one another, ex-
panding or contracting the roof as desired. On
these large boats families lived the year round. I
soon observed that among the multitude of children
playing on and about the boat practically one half
wore gourds upon their backs between the shoulders
and secured by bands. 1 asked one of the
laundresses, who came on board frequently, why
the distinction was made. She answered that
those who did not wear gourds were girls ; those
who did were boys ; thus the latter could be rescued
when they fell overboard. The girls were not
considered worth the trouble.
One early morning I joined a party of American
captains, who were invited to make the trip to
Canton on a small United States steamer, the Tiger,
in command of Lieutenant Perry, a son of Com-
modore Perry, as I remember. We sailed between
miles of boats, lining the banks, occupied by whole
families, often from birth to death, who seldom
went ashore, and then only to exchange fish for tea
and dungaree. On landing at about eight A. M.
we went to the factory of Nye Brothers and Co.,
and found Mr. Gideon Nye, Jr., in his counting-
room, which was fitted up like a room in a palace.
There were eighteen of us, and we had hardly
entered before a Chinese servant appeared, silently
ran his eye over the company, apparently counting
us, and disappeared. In about thirty minutes he
returned and announced that breakfast was ready,


and led the party to one of the most elegantly
furnished rooms and one of the best appointed
tables that it has been my lot to see. No inquiry
had been made whether we had had breakfast, and
no invitation to one had been extended. On the
whole, among all the men 1 have met in many
lands and in various stations in life, Mr. Gideon
Nye, Jr., remains in my memory as one of the
most finished, yet natural, native gentlemen I have
gyer known. He was a counting-room king.
We loaded at Whampoa with a miscellaneous
cargo, largely of raw sugar, for Shanghai, and took
a number of native Chinese merchants as passen-
gers. It seemed strange to see Chinamen wea-
ring the heaviest, costliest furs, and attended by
a retinue of servants, one in each retinue kept con-
stantly employed in preparing opium for his master
and manipulating a small piece for hours.
Our experience at Shanghai rectified our ideas
as to the climate of China. I had supposed it
was generally warm all through China, but I never
suffered more from cold than at Shanghai. Our
first point of approach was Woosung, correspond-
ing to Shanghai much as Whampoa does to
Canton. At Shanghai, after discharging, we load-
ed with tea and silk for London. made a
fast passage through the China Sea to Angier
Point, then the western extremity of the island of
Java, which extremity was afterward submerged
by submarine, seismic action. Angier Point was
the last place we touched at, the last port made


either going from China or sailing to it. There
mails were left, supplies of fresh provisions
taken, and reports entered by each ship, its
name, commander, destination, where from, and
date of entry. Angier Point was the most
luxuriously tropical and in verdure and in display
of fruits, flowers, and bird life I have ever seen.
There was no road, not even a beaten path; the
rank growth of grass defeating the attempt to
make one. The grass reached nearly to the
shoulders, and to thrid it was like walking through
a field of high grain. The orange trees were at
once in blossom and ripened fruit; the bananas
hung in huge clusters; the tall cocoa palms bore
large cocoanuts, which the monkeys threw about.
On the branches of the trees were perched cock-
atoos, Java sparrows, and birds of the most
brilliant plumage in countless numbers, and the
monkeys jabbered and gamboled, but the climate
was deadly. The Dutch maintained a large fort
there, but it was garrisoned only by native troops
gathered from Sumatra, China, and on the island.
Two or three Dutch officers were kept there, and
they were relieved every few months. I saw one
of the officers, but he looked more coffee-colored
than even the natives.
We doubled the Cape of Good Hope on our
return, between latitudes 37� and 40�, to catch the
light but favoring easterly current and Breeze. Off
Lagullas Banks, southeast of the Cape, we were
caught in a tremendous gale, and were hove to for


nearly twenty-four hours. The sea pounded us
mercilessly, the shallow waters there affording a
leverage for seas of unusual height and severity.
In writing up the log, the captain held himself
firmly to the cabin table with his left hand, while
he wrote with his right. I gripped the table opposite
him with my left hand, while I held the inkstand
in my right, shifting its level to suit the motion of
the ship ; otherwise the ink would have been thrown
out and spilled over the cabin, I suppose my face
must have expressed some annoyance, which the
captain noticed, as he said : (( A great deal better
than a calm, Mr. Frank, a great deal better than a
calm �.
It is more of a science than is commonly supposed
to conquer currents and storms. Many a ship is
never heard from simply because she was hove to
on the wrong tack, against, instead of with, the
cyclonic wind currents. It is the nautical genius
utilizing nautical science that differentiates the
thoroughbred from the ordinary commander, who
lumbers along and occasionally loses his ship.
Captain Mather had an unusually full library of
nautical literature, of which Reid?s Law of Storms
was most frequently consulted. He was well read
in all of Maury?s very extensive nautical literature.
Maury?s works greatly interested me, and lam
firmly of the opinion that no other man has ever so
subtly explored, and so accurately, sympathetically,
and interestingly reported, the mystery of the sea.
The sight of St. Mary?s Island, the most


southeasterly of the Azores, with its mountain
shapes rich with verdure, the red-tiled roofs,
the indented shores, broke with a charm upon
eyes long fasting for a sight of land. It is a unique
experience sighting islands at sea from a sailing
'vessel, particularly in or near tropical latitudes.
First, the loom of the land, the appearance of
land, projected by refraction into the sky, then
the land itself, gradually enlarging in area, and
continuously disclosing fresh allurement. First
� sighting a sail � is an occasion of great interest,
the bare tip of the mainmast, less in height than the
length of a walking-stick, slowly rising, showing
one sail after another, till finally the whole hull is
raised.
Soon we were in London, among the clipper
But I must not spin this yarn longer. A
ship has a history, and many a history that would
make a thrilljng story. The Nightingale was sold
to Nye Brothers and Co., Canton, under whose
ownership Captain Mather continued in command.
During one of her passages to New York from
Shanghai the firm became embarrassed. The
daily papers, brought on board by the pilot, pub-
lished the fact. The captain anchored off Staten
Island, in the waters of Richmond County. The
ship was hardly anchored before the officers of the
law had libeled her and her cargo for one million of
dollars. Unfortunately for the first comers, the
processes had been made out for the County of New
York. The late comers, observing this, had libeled


the ship as in Richmond County ; the first were last,,
the last first. After lying two or three days at
anchor, the impatient officers who had domiciled
themselves on board, and the more impatient
counsel whom they represented, inquired of the
captain why he delayed and when he proposed to
weigh anchor. The captain replied : � The laws
secure every man, except the master, the payment
of his just dues. lam not secured, but lam very
comfortable here, and expect to remain quite a.
while �. Well, then, captain, we shall have to
try to make you take the ship up �, they rejoined.
� That is just what I would like to see tried, was
the captain?s reply. �My voyage is not up; not
only marshals and judges are powerless, but if the
President of the United States were to presume to
come on board and give orders, he would be passed
swiftly over the ship?s side �. As interest, costs,
and expenses were running rapidly, the captain was
invited to make out his account, and was paid in
gold. The voyage was resumed, and in a few
hours the Nightingale was alongside her pier in
New York city.
The Nightingale, so famous for speed, was
purchased by parties who engaged in the slave
trade. When the civil war broke out, she was
taken by the navy for government use. I wonder
where she is now, if still afloat, and what she is
doing.
The career of her commander was renowned.
When the civil war broke out in ?6l, the Union,


Defense Committee, consisting of the leading
merchants, capitalists, and other eminent citizens
in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and
organized as auxiliary to the navy in its then
helpless condition, concerned themselves with
selecting and suggesting to the government the
ablest men as commanders, and the most desirable
craft available. The first name sent up by the
committee was that of Captain Mather, then in his
thirty-sixth year, and he was the first man commis-
sioned by the Department. The first vessel, the
steamship Quaker City, noted for speed and
strength, was taken from the Havana line, and
included in Commodore Stringham?s squadron
blockading Chesapeake Bay. Captain Mather was
placed in command of her, and in spite of much
jealousy, retained it for about one year, in which
time the number of captures of the Quaker City, I
am informed, exceeded those of any other vessel.
The captain was transferred at his request to active
service, under Commodore Dupont. While under
detail to the coast of Florida landing with a party
of marines ?he was shot with three balls, and
instantly killed, in March, ?62, before one of the
Confederate forts near Fernandina. He was
reported to have slain many men before he fell, and
the traditions of his courage remain to this day.
His body and accoutrements were returned by the
Confederates under a flag of truce, with honor, as
they said, because he had fought them so bravely.
Commodore Dupont wrote me a long personal


letter of eulogy of him and affection for him-
Secretary Welles, in his general orders, among
other strong expressions of commendation, said,
(( Captain Mather had no superior among those
patriotic commanders who have been transferred to
the Navy from the Mercantile Marine �.
The good \nights are dust.
Their good swords are rust,
Their souls are with the saints. We trust.
