Hail Glorious Peace with smile for all the world!
Sheathed is the sword, and battle-flags are furled !
Loud peal the bells and mighty anthems rise,
To fill with gratitude the opened skies ;
Let all the nations lift triumphant voice,
With deep thanksgiving in the Lord rejoice !
Come Wondrous Love and soothe the quivering earth,
From dust and ashes bring immortal birth;
Cheer saddened hearts and on their sorrow shed
The light that glorifies their sacred dead ;
Turn desolations into chastened praise,
To celebrate this happiest day of days.
Past is the Shudd ring Night—gone thunder s roar,
Mom’s golden glory breaks on sea and shore ;
Heavn joineth earth in holiest embrace,
Joy poureth forth from high and lowly place,
Angels and men, all-jubilant, up-raise
Their great glad hymn of universal praise.
Lord God of Hosts ! by whose decree alone
Empires arise or kings are overthrown—
Humbly we bow—in reverence adore,
And own Thy Majesty for evermore.
Speak Thou with voice the world hath never heard,
That every soul obey th* Almighty Word.
Hail to the Prince of Victory and" Peace !
Christ is enthroned ! His Kingdom shall increase !
Earth’s melting crowns and falling thrones confess
His undisputed Reign of Righteousness.
Homage to Him—kings, peoples, all proclaim ;
In one vast Hallelujah laud His name.
