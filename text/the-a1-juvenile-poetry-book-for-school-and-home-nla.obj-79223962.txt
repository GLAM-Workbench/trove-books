TEA TIME.
[W. C. Bennett.]
CTING, kettle, sing,
AS/ Etty can hear
Your kind song bring
Nice tea time near;
Nice toast and tea,
Kettle, I know,
Not far can be
When you sing so.
Sing father here,
Now the room?s bright?
Bright, snug, and dear
With warm firelight.
Sing, bring him home;
We always know
He soon will come
When you sing so.
Here?s his soft chair,
Soon you will see
Us sitting there ?
I on his knee;
You, kettle, too
Your love must show ;
What can you do?
Sing on just so.


A Little Cock Sparrow
GOOD NIGHT!
JAM the smallest boy in school,
As you can see, just now ;
The audience will, I hope, keep cool
As thus I make my bow. (bows)
You can?t expect much of a speech
From such a little mite ;
Permit me, then, to bow to each,
And say to all?Good Night! (bows)
THE LITTLE GIRL TO HER DOLLY.
\ I / HERE, go to sleep, dolly, in own mother?s lap,
I?ve put on your night-gown and neat little cap
So sleep, pretty baby, and shut up your eye?
Bye-bye, little dolly, lie still, and bye-bye.
I?ll lay my clean handkerchief over your head,
And then make believe that my lap is your bed ;
So hush, little dear, and be sure you don?t cry?
Bye-bye, little dolly, lie still, and bye-bye.
There, now it is morning, and time to get up,
And I?ll crumb you a mess in my doll?s china cup ;
So wake, little baby, and open your eye,
For I think it high time to have done with bye-bye.
A LITTLE COCK SPARROW.
H LITTLE cock sparrow
A�l He sat on a tree ;
He hopped and he skipped,
So merry was he.


A little boy came
With bow and arrow,
And said, ? I will shoot
That little cock sparrow !
? His head will make
A nice little stew ;
His body will make
A nice pie too.?
? Oh, no ! ? said the sparrow,
?That never will do,?
So he spread out his wings
And away he flew.
WORK AND PLAY.
WORK while you work,
Play while you play,
That is the way
To be cheerful and gay.
All that you do,
Do with your might ;
Things done by halves
Are never done right.
One thing each time,
And that done well,
Is a very good rule
As many can tell.
Moments are useless
Trifled away ;
Work while you work
And play while you play.


The Little Beggar Girl
MY LITTLE DOGGIE.
IHAD a little doggie
That used to sit and beg ;
Doggie tumbled down the stairs
And broke his little leg.
Oh! doggie, I will nurse you,
And try to make you well ;
And you shall have a collar
With a pretty little bell.
Ah ! doggie, don?t you think
You should very faithful be,
For having such a loving friend
To comfort you as me 1
And when your leg is better,
And you can run and play,
We?ll have a scamper in the fields,
And see them making hay.
But, doggie, you must promise
(And mind your word to keep)
Not once to tease the little lambs
Or run among the sheep ;
And then the yellow ?chicks,?
That play upon the grass,
You must not even wag your tail
To scare them as you pass !
THE LITTLE BEGGAR GIRL.
H7 HERE?S a poor beggar going by,
I see her looking in ;
She?s just about as tall as I,
Only so very thin.


She has no shoes upon her feet?
She is so very poor?
And hardly anything to eat ;
I pity her I?m sure.
But I have got nice clothes, you know,
And meat, and bread, and fire;
And you, mamma, that love me so,
And all that I desire.
If I were forced to stroll so far,
Oh, dear ! what should I do ;
I wish she had a dear mamma,
Just such a one as you.
Here, little girl, come back again,
I pity you, I?m sure;
I wish I were but rich, and then
You should not be so poor.
THE VIOLET.
[Jane Taylor.]
SOWN in a green and shady bed
A modest violet grew;
Its stalk was bent, it hung its head,
As if to hide from view.
And yet it was a lovely flow?r,
Its colors bright and fair ;
It might have graced a rosy bow?r,
Instead of hiding there.
Yet there it was content to bloom,
In modest tints array?d,
And there diffused its sweet perfume
Within the silent shade.


Then let me to the valley go,
This pretty flow?r to see,
That I may also learn to grow
In sweet humility.
THE LITTLE MAIDEN.
[F. E. Weatherly, in Children?s Birthday Book .]
I ?YE read somewhere about a girl
Whose cheeks are rosy red,
While golden tresses, curl on curl,
Bedeck her pretty head ;
Her eyes I?m told are bright and blue,
Her smile is kind and sweet,
The errands she is asked to do
Are done with willing feet.
Tis said that when she goes to school,
She's just the sweetest lass ;
So quick to mind the slightest rule,
And prompt in every class.
To girls and boys she?s never rude
When all are at their play ;
Her ? conduct,? be it understood,
Is ? perfect ? every day.
Where lives this child, I cannot say,
Nor who her parents are,
Although for many a weary day
I?ve sought her near and far.
If you should ever see her smile
As o?er the world you rove,
Just hold her hand a little while,
And give her my best love.


NEVER GIVE UP.
@NE step and then another,
And the longest walk is ended ;
One stitch and then another,
And the largest rent is mended.
One brick upon another,
And the highest wall is made;
One flake upon another,
And the deepest snow is laid.
Then do not look so sadly
On the work you have to do,
And say that such a mighty task
You never can get through.
But only try each moment
To do your very best,
And then the task that looked so big
Will grow from less to less.
What seemed at first so hopeless
Will to your efforts bend ;
If you will but keep at it
The longest task will end.
A FAIR LITTLE GIRL.
[Lord Houghton.]
PFAIR little girl sat under a tree,
Sewing as long as her eyes could see ;
Then smoothed her work and folded it right,
And said, ? Dear work, good-night! good-night! ,!


Such a number of rooks came over her head,
Crying, ? Caw ! caw ! ? on their way to bed ;
She said as she watched their curious flight,
? Little black things, good-night ! good-night! ?
The horses neighed and the oxen lowed,
The sheep?s ? Bleat! bleat! ? came over the road
All seeming to say with a quiet delight,
? Good little girl, good-night! good-night! ?
She did not say to the sun good-night,
Though she saw him there like a ball of light;
For she knew he had God?s time to keep
All over the world, and never could sleep.
The tall pink foxglove bowed his head,
The violet curtsied and went to bed ;
And good little Lucy tied up her hair,
And said on her knees her favourite prayer.
And while on her pillow she softly lay,
She knew nothing more till again it was day ;
And all things said to the beautiful sun,
? Good-morning ! good-morning ! our work is
begun.?
THE SHEEP.
T @AZY sheep, pray tell me why
I?* In the pleasant fields you lie,
Eating grass and daisies white
From the morning till the night?
Everything can something do,
But what kind of use are you ?


Nay, my little master, nay,
Do not serve me so, I pray :
Don?t you see the wool that grows
On my back to make your clothes 1
Cold, and very cold you?d get
If I did not give you it.
True, it seems a pleasant thing
To nip the daisies in the spring ;
But many chilly nights I pass
On the cold and dewy grass,
Or pick a scanty dinner where
All the common?s brown and bare.
Then the farmer comes at last,
When the merry spring is past,
And cuts my woolly coat away
To warm you in the winter?s day :
Little master, this is why
In the pleasant fields I lie.
THE TRUTHFUL BOY.
ONCE there was a little boy
With curly head and pleasant eye,
A boy who always told the truth,
And never, never told a lie.
And when he trotted off to school,
The children all about would cry,
There goes the curly-headed boy,
The boy who never tells a lie.


And everybody loved him so,
Because he always told the truth,
That every day, as he grew up,
?Twas said, There goes the honest youth.
And when the people that stood near
Would turn to ask the reason why,
The answer would be always this?
Because he never tells a lie.
THE CATS? TEA PARTY.
[P. E. Weathbklt, in Children?s Birthday Book.']
OIVE little pussy-cats invited out to tea
i- b Cried, ? Mother, let us go; oh, do ! for good
we?ll surely be!
We?ll wear our bibs and hold our things as you have
shown us how?
Spoons in right paws, cups in left, and make a pretty
bow;
We?ll always say, ? Yes, if you please,? and ? Only
half of that.? ?
? Then go, my darling children,? said the happy
mother cat.
The five little pussy-cats went out that night to tea,
Their heads were smooth and glossy, their tails were
swinging free.
They held their things as they had learned, and tried
to be polite,
With snowy bibs beneath their chins they were a
pretty sight;
But, alas for manners beautiful, and coats as soft as
silk,
The moment that the little kits were asked to take
some milk,


They dropped their spoons, forgot to bow, and, oh,
what do you think !
They put their noses in the cups, and all began to
drink !
Yes, every naughty little kit set up a miou for more,
Then knocked the teacups over, and scampered
through the door !
THE DISOBEDIENT LITTLE FISH.
mother,? said a little fish,
J?/ ? Pray is not that a fly 1
I?m very hungry and I wish
You?d let me go and try.?
? Sweet innocent,? the mother cried,
And started from her nook,
? That horrid fly is put to hide
The sharpness of the hook.?
Now, as I?ve heard, this little trout
Was young and foolish too,
And so he thought he?d venture out,
To see if it were true.
And round about the hook he played
With many a longing look,
And ?? Dear me,? to himself he said,
? I?m sure that?s not a hook.
? I can but give one little pluck :
Let?s see, and so I will.?
So on he went, and lo! it struck
Quite through his little gill.


And as he faint and fainter grew,
With hollow voice he cried,
? Dear mother, had I minded you,
I need not now have died.?
THE GIANT.
pjO tell me why the kettle?s lid
Is moving up and down ;
And why that smoke comes puffing out
So fiercely from the kettle?s spout ?
It sprinkles, see, your gown !?
?Ah ! Charlie, boy, you do not know
That under that small lid
A giant, powerful and strong,
Who pushes ships and trains along,
Is in the kettle hid! ?
? A real giant ? Oh, mamma,
You must be in a dream.?
?No dream, my child. This slave of man.
Who does more work than horses can,
This giant?s name is Steam.
?Giants of old were mighty men,
Who mighty deeds could do ;
So when one does the work of ten ,
In digging mine or draining fen,
We call him giant too.?


THE PEDDLER?S CARAVAN.
[From Lilliput Levee.']
I WISH I lived in a caravan,
With a horse to drive like the peddler man;
Where he comes from nobody knows,
Or where he goes to ?but on he goes.
His caravan has windows two, [through ;
And a chimney of tin that the smoke comes
He has a wife, with a baby brown,
As they go riding from town to town.
Chairs to mend and delf to sell,
He clashes the basins like a bell;
Tea-trays, baskets, ranged in order,
Plates with the alphabet round the border !
The roads are brown, and green are the fields,
But his house is just like a shanty on wheels ;
The world is round, and he can ride,
Rumble, and splash to the other side !
W'ith the peddler man I should like to roam,
And write a book when I came home ;
Ail the people would read my book,
Just like the travels of Captain Cook !
GOING TO BED.
[Dora Greenell.]
(Canterbury Poets: Walter Scott, London.)
IT is time to go to bed !
Oh ! how soon the words are spoken ;
Oh ! how sweet a spell is broken
When these words of fate are said?


It is time to go to bed !
Is it time to go to bed?
Surely bed a time can wait
Till the pleasant tale is read
At our father?s knee. How cheery
Burns the fire ; we are not weary?
Why should it be time for bed
Just because the clock strikes eight 1
While they talk let us be hiding
Just behind the great arm-chairs.
It may be they will forget us;
It may be that they will let us
Stay to supper, stay to prayers,
Go at last with them upstairs
Hand in hand with father, mother?
Kisses given, ? Good-nights ? said.
?Twill be time for sister, brother,
Time for me to go to bed.
ONE MOUTH MORE.
[Tom Taylor.]
U TT is but one mouth more, father;
1 And He that can bestow
Wherewith to satisfy all needs
Will still provide, I know.
Hark, how outside the wind doth roar!
See, how chill drives the sleet!
He came for shelter to our door
Of all doors in the street.
When Willy ran home from the school
He found him shivering there ;


His eye looked up in Willy?s face,
Out of the draggled hair,
As if it said ? I have no food,
No sheltering roof have I;
If you?ll not take me in to live,
I must stay here to die.?
I know that you have sore to do
To keep us clothed and fed;
How mother?s bound to save and spare ;
How all eat caretul bread ;
But God, that blessed the widow?s mite
And filled the widow?s cruse,
Will not let miss the bone or crust
For which poor doggie sues.
I?ll save his portion out of mine,
And so will Willy too ;
He?ll watch your bundle while you dine, ?
We?ll find him work to do,
And when he wags his tail at meat
Or barks with us at play,
If there be one more mouth to eat,
There?s one more grace to say.
BILLY AND ME!
[James Hogg.]
YVJHERE the pools are bright and deep,
* * Where the grey trout lies asleep,
Up the river and o?er the lea,
That?s the way for Billy and me.


Where the blackbird sings the latest,
Where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest,
Where the nestlings chirp and flee,
That?s the way for Billy and me.
Where the mowers mow the cleanest,
Where the hay lies thick and greenest,
There to trace the homeward bee,
That?s the way for Billy and me.
Where the hazel bank is steepest,
Where the shadow lies the deepest,
Where the clustering nuts fall free,
That?s the way for Billy and me.
Why the boys should drive away
Little maidens from their play,
Or love to banter and fight so well,
That?s the thing I never could tell.
But this I know I love to play
Through the meadow, along the hay ;
Up the water and o?er the lea,
That?s the way for Billy and me.
THE LITTLE BROWN SPARROW.
7T LITTLE brown sparrow, contented and gay,
JOT Went hopping about on a cold wintry day
In search of a dinner, of porridge or bread ;
Or, if not to be had, then potatoes instead.
But never an atom of food could she find,
Save morsels of ice, which were not to her mind.


But what did she see 1 Only think! the old cat,
So snugly at rest on the kitchen door-mat.
And, close by Miss Pussy a saucer of food,
And, oh, it was tempting, so sweet and so good !
? Well, now,? thought the sparrow, ? ?tis really
vexatious,
That the wicked old cat should have food and to
spare,
While I am so hungry?Fm really voracious,
And nothing around me but snow everywhere !
I think I?ll just venture a little bit nearer
(The horrid old thing, I feel sure, is asleep);
And really I?d just like to see somewhat clearer
That food in the saucer?l must have a peep.?
So saying, she flew from the left to the right,
And gazed at the saucer with hungry delight,
Till growing more bold, she advanced with a hop,
Believing the cat to be ?sound as a top.?
But here let me whisper a secret to you?
Puss heard her quite well, and was watching her, too !
That night our brown sparrow had promised to go
With a friend of her own, on account of the snow,
Intending together to rest on a tree ;
But she never appeared : so, now, where could she be ?
MARJORIE?S ALMANAC.
[J. B. Aldrich.]
ROBINS in the tree-tops,
Blossoms in the grass,
Green things are growing
Ev?rywhere you pass,


Sudden little breezes,
Show?rs of silver dew,
Black bough and bent twig
Budding out anew.
Pine tree and willow tree,
Fringed elm and larch?
Don?t you think that Maytime?s
Pleasanter than March ?
Apples in the orchard,
Mellowing one by one,
Strawberries upturning
Soft cheeks to the sun.
Roses faint with sweetness,
Lilies fair of face,
Drowsy sense and murmurs
Haunting ev?ry place.
Lengths of golden sunshine,
Moonlight bright as day?
Don?t you think that Summer?s
Pleasanter than May ?
Roger in the corn-patch
Whistling negro songs;
Pussy by the hearth-side
Romping with the tongs.
Chestnuts in the ashes
Burning through the rind,
Red leaf and gold leaf
Rustling down the wind.
Mother ?doing? peaches
All the afternoon ?
Don?t you think that Autumn?s
Pleasanter than June ?


Little fairy snowflakes
Dancing in the flue,
Old Mr. Santa Claus,
What is keeping you ?
Twilight and firelight,
Shadows come and go,
Merry chime of sleigh bells
Tinkling through the snow.
Mother?s knitting stockings,
Pussy?s got the ball ?
Don?t you think that Winter?s
Pleasanter than all?
GRANDPAPA.
[Miss Muloch.]
RANDPAPA?S hair is very white,
And grandpapa walks but slow ;
He likes to sit still in his easy chair
While the children come and go.
? Hush ! play quietly,? says mamma ;
? Let nobody trouble dear grandpapa.?
Grandpapa?s hand is thin and weak,
It has worked hard all his days;
A strong right hand, and an honest hand,
That has won all good men?s praise.
? Kiss it tenderly,? says mamma ; ?
? Let everyone honour grandpapa.?
Grandpapa?s eyes are growing dim,
They have looked on sorrow and death ;
But the love-light never went out of them,
Nor the courage and the faith.
c 2


? You, children, all of you,? says mamma,
? Have need to look up to grandpapa.?
Grandpapa?s years are wearing few,
But he leaves a blessing behind ;
A good life lived, and a good fight fought,
True heart, and equal mind.
? Remember, my children,? says mamma,
? You bear the name of your grandpapa.?
RESCUED.
[Margaret Hatcraft.]
\ I /HE city is crowded and noisy,
� The clamour of noonday is high,
All eager for business or pleasure
The people are hurrying by.
A sweet little maiden is passing,
And stepping so gaily along?
But what is the merriment yonder,
Oh, what is that listening throng ?
? It?s Punch ! ? little Daisy exclaimeth
? For Judy and Toby I see : ?
Away in an instant she rushes,
Half over the road in her glee.
The people are pausing in horror?
Oh, list to that tremulous cry !
Down, down little Daisy is falling,
Where horses come galloping by.
The mother is hiding her vision,
The father seems stricken to stone?


Will nobody succour their floweret,
Their bright little blossom?their own ?
Will nobody rescue the baby
From under those clattering feet 1
Ah, see him?the brave little hero
Who rushes the danger to meet!
?Tis only a merry-eyed schoolboy,
With heart that is tender and brave,
What though his own life be in peril ?
He?s ready to succour and save;
For heroes of self are unmindful?
For others they strive and they pray ;
Ah, children, just hear me, my darlings
You too may be heroes for aye!
MR. NOBODY.
IKNOW a funny little man,
As quiet as a mouse,
Who does the mischief that is done
In everybody?s house!
There?s no one ever sees his face,
And yet we all agree
That every plate we break was cracked
By Mr. Nobody.
?Tis he who always tears our books,
Who leaves the door ajar ;
He pulls the buttons from our shirts
And scatters pins afar.
That squeaking door will always squeak,
For, prithee, don?t you see,
We leave the oiling to be done
By Mr. Nobody.


He puts damp wood upon the fire,
That kettles cannot boil;
His are the feet that bring in mud
And all the carpets soil.
The papers always are mislaid ;
Who had them last but he 1
There?s no one tosses them about
But Mr. Nobody.
The finger-marks upon the door
By none of us are made ;
We never leave the blinds unclosed
To let the curtains fade.
The ink we never spill ; the boots
That lying round you see
Are not our boots?they all belong
To Mr. Nobody.
THE CHILDREN?S LAMENT FOR BABY
[F. T. Palgkave.]
(By Kind Permission of the Author.)
OEAR little baby! Day by day
We watched as on the bed it lay ;
And oft it?s eyes it open'd wide,
And smiled to see us at its side.
The clothes are on the empty bed ;
But where is little baby fled 1
Its limbs were growing long and fine,
Its hands put out to clasp and twine;
The lips began to coo and call;
It sat upright and wish?d to crawl;
And brighter daily round its head
The golden hair like sunrise spread.


False Friends-like
When first within the cot it lay,
We ask?d if it had come to stay ;
And screamed for joy to hear them tell
?Twas sent from God with us to dwell,
And play about till it was grown,
And be our very, very own.
And when its eyes were sunk and dim,
And wasting seized each tiny limb,
We nursed it on our knees all day,
And begg?d it not to go away:
It moved its head and faintly cried,
And then lay still and sigh?d and sigh?d,
And now we cry and look in vain,
And cannot see it here again :
The cot is white, and still, and bare,
But baby smiles and sings elsewhere ?
Among God?s angels bright and dear :
Yet not more angel there than here.
FAT.SK FRIENDS-LIKE.
[Wm. Barnes.]
< 7y?HEN I was still a boy, and mother?s pride,
A bigger boy spoke up to me so kind-like,
? If you do like, I?ll treat you to a ride
In this wheelbarrow.? So then I was blind-like
To what he had a-working in his mind-like,
And mounted for a passenger inside;
And coming to a puddle, pretty wide,
He tipp?d me in, a-grinning back behind-like,
So when a man may come to me so thick-like,
And shake my hand where once he passed me by,


And tell me he would do me this or that,
I can?t help thinking of the big boy?s trick-like,
And, then for all I can but wag my hat,
And thank him : I do feel a little shy.
THE MISTAKEN STAG.
[Mbs. Sale Barker.]
P HANDSOME stag, one summer?s day
Was wandering near a lake,
And walking in to cool his feet,
Said, ? Here a rest I?ll take.?
And looking down into the stream,
Reflected saw his head,
His splendid antlers branching out,
His nostrils gleaming red.
Then glancing at his slender legs,
He thought them poor and small,
Felt angry at the slim, slight things,
And wished he?d none at all.
Just then an angry growl was heard,
A lion came in sight;
The stag, with beating heart sprang up,
And rapidly took flight.
The slender legs he had abused
Did him good service now,
The lion soon was left behind,
The stag knew scarcely how.


But so it was ; those active legs,
And little nimble feet,
Had galloped swiftly o?er the turf,
And made a good retreat.
Poor stag ! He reaches now a wood,
And thinks he?ll shelter find ;
He?s filled with joy?the lion too :
They?re of the self-same mind.
The savage lion sees the stag
Plunge in amongst the trees,
His horns are caught, he cannot move,
His blood now seems to freeze,
The lion quickly follows him,
And, when it is too late,
The stag, with bitter self-reproach,
Bemoans his hapless fate.
? I have indeed deceived myself;
Oh! Woe is me !? he cries ;
? My antlers, which I valued so,
Have wrought my death,? he sighs.
? My slender legs, my little feet,
Which I did so despise,
Did all they could to save my life.?
And so the poor stag dies.
A warning, children, we may take
From this old tale so sad :
We often think what?s bad is best,
And what is good is bad.


ON THE CLOCK.
CTEE the neat little clock, in the comer it stands,
And points out the time with its two pretty hands :
The one shows the minute, the other the hour,
As you often may see in the church?s high tower.
The pendulum swings inside the long case,
And sends the two hands round the neat pretty face;
And lest they should move on too slow or too quick,
It swings to and fro with a tick-a-tick-tick.
There?s a nice little bell, which a hammer does knock,
And when we hear that we may tell what?s o?clock ;
But we love twelve and five, as it then is our rule
Our lessons to finish and march out of school.
Hark ! hark ! now its strikes ; there?s one, two, three,
four,
Five, six, seven, eight?Will it strike any more ?
Yes, yes, if you listen, you?ll hear when ?tis done?
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, and the next will be one.
But the wheels would not move, nor the pendulum
swing,
Nor the hammer?s tap, tap, make the little bell ring,
Only two little weights pull the wheels round and
round,
And while they?re in motion they still make a sound.
So must I, like the clock, have my face clean and
bright,
And my hands while they?re moving should always
do right;
My tongue must be guided to say what is true
Wherever I go or whatever I do !


THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN.
QOME boys were once engaged in play
%!D In a noisy boisterous kind of way,
Like boys who are, as these boys were,
Brimful of fun and free from care.
It chanced that at that time of day,
Old Clem was passing by that way.
A rag and bottle man was he,
As dirty as any man can be;
The implement he used was hooked
And his ways, ?twas said, were just as crooked.
Just as old Clem was passing by,
A ball that accidentally
Was widely thrown, flew over straight
And hit old Clem upon his pate.
Now, Johnny Wise was standing near,
And to old Clem he said ? I fear
You?re hurt; but you yourself must own
The ball was not on purpose thrown.
I?m sorry, although it was not meant;
Pray, sir, excuse the accident.?
? Nay, boy,? said Clem; ? it?s done no harm ?
There?s no occasion for alarm :
I?m only pleased, my boy, to see
That you deem me worthy of sympathy,
Most boys abuse poor men like us ;
?Tis seldom we are treated thus.?
Then to his playmates John ran back,
And they, deriding him, said ? Why, Jack,
We really don?t see how you can
Politeness waste on a dirty old man ! ?
? Why not 1? said John. The question to me
Is not whether Clem may a gentleman be,
But whether I am one and so
I did what a gentleman ought to do.?


THE SAILOR AND THE DOG.
[A. L. O. E.]
\ I /HE dreary night had passed away,
?L The dawn was in the skies,
But senseless on his heaving raft
The shipwrecked sailor lies ;
Yet, sleepless, watchful, faithful friend,
His dog is striving there
To rouse the sailor from his swoon
To bid him not despair.
The dog had seen the distant sail
Across the rolling seas 3
The dog?s loud eager bark for help
Is borne upon the breeze !
And nearer, nearer comes the ship,
And gallant tars prepare
To launch the boat to reach the raft?
Oh, who would now despair ?
Saved ! saved they are ! oh, blessed day.
The dog and shipwrecked boy?
Companions once in sufferings,
Companions now in joy !
The sailor lived to tell at home
How God had heard his prayer,
And sent in mercy help to him
When all was deep despair.
Learn then, even in the darkest hour,
To trust the Almighty?s care ;
His eye beholds, His hand protects?
Oh, who would then despair ?


DUTIFUL JEM.
> I /HERE was a poor widow, she lived in a cot,
I She scarcely a blanket to warm her had got;
Her windows were broken, her walls were all bare,
And the cold winter wind often whistled in there.
Poor Susan was old. and too feeble to spin,
Her forehead was wrinkled, her hands they were thin ;
And she must have starved as so many have done,
If she had not been blessed with a good little son.
But he loved her well, like a dutiful lad,
And thought her the very best friend that he had ;
And now to neglect or forsake her he knew,
Was the most wicked thing he could possibly do.
For he was quite healthy, and active, and stout,
While his poor mother hardly could hobble about,
For he thought it his duty and greatest delight
To work for her living from morning to night.
So he went every morning, as gay as a lark,
And worked all day long in the fields till ?twas dark ;
Then came home again to his dear mother?s cot,
And joyfully gave her the wages he got.
And oh, how she loved him ! how great was her joy
To think her dear Jem was a dutiful boy :
Her arm round his neck she would tenderly cast,
And kiss his red cheek, while the tears trickled fast.
Oh, then, was not this little Jem happier far
Than naughty, and idle, and wicked boys are 1
For, as long as he lived, ?twas his comfort and joy
To think he?d not been an undutiful boy.


THE MISGUIDED LAMB.
[Frederick E. Weatherlet: Told in the Twilight.']
\ I /HERE were two little girls who had
A fond devoted mammy,
But spent their warm affections on
A most ungrateful lamby.
For spite of all the care of Ruth,
And all the love of Mary,
This lamb was a misguided youth,
Most crooked and contrary.
On Sunday, when they went to church,
And wished to be without him,
He used to wander up the aisle,
And stop and stare about him.
And when the parson and the clerk
Looked stern at Ruth and Mary,
They wished they did not own a lamb
So crooked and contrary.
He used to bleat most piteously
When they came up the mountain,
As if to say, ? I am so dry,
Td like to drink the fountain ! ?
But when they drew a pail for him
(You really scarce might think it),
He wagged his tail and winked his eye,
And simply wouldn?t drink it.
It chanced one day they went to pay
Their morning salutation ;
But though they called he never came,
Much to their consternation.


They sought him high, they sought him low,
But, no ! they could not find him ;
They said, ? He will, he must come back,
And bring his tail behind him ! ?
They sought him up the windy cliff,
And down the ferny hollow,
And still they said, ?He can?t be lost! ?
And still their feet did follow.
Alas! they found him dead at last?
Alas ! for Ruth and Mary ;
But then, you see, he always was
So crooked and contrary.
MARGARET WILSON.
{A True Story.)
[F. T. Palgbave.]
FOUR children at their little play
Across the iron-furrow?d way,
Joyous in all the joy of May.
Three, babies ; and one, Margaret,
In charge upon the others set
To lift and soothe them if they fret.
The sky is blue ; the sun is bright;
The little voices, pure and light,
Make music as they laugh outright.
The noiseless weight of giant wheels
Amongst them in a moment steals,
And death is rolling at their heels.


She ran with one to reach the side,
And reach?d it, and looked back and spied,
Where the dark wheels right towards them slide,
The other two, that were forgot,
Playing by Death and knowing not,
And drew them to the narrow spot
Between the rails and platform-side
Safe nestling down ; but as they glide
The wheel-rods struck her and she died.
By those she died for there she lay,
Nor any word could Margaret say,
But closed her eyes and pass?d away.
My little heroine ! though I ne?er
Can look upon thy features fair,
Nor kiss the lips that mangled were.
Too small a thing from Fame to have
A portion with the great and brave,
And unknown in thy lowly grave;
Yet thy true heart and fearless faith,
And agony of love in death
God saw, and He remembereth.
BILL IS A BRIGHT BOY.
[A. T. Blackie.]
BILL is a bright boy; do you know Bill ?
Marching cheerily up and down hill.
Bill is a bright boy at books and at play,
A right and a tight boy all the boys say.


His face is like roses in flush of the June,
His eyes like the welkin when cloudless the moon,
His step is like fountains that bicker with glee,
Beneath the green mountains down to the sea.
When Bill plays at cricket no ball on the green
Is shot from the wicket so sharp and so clean;
He stands at his station as strong as a king
When he lifts up a nation on victory?s wing
When bent upon study he girds to his books,
No frown ever ploughs the smooth pride of his
looks;
I came, and I saw, and I conquered at will?
This be the law for great Caesar and Bill.
As mild as a maiden where mildness belongs,
He?s hot as Achilles when goaded by wrongs;
He flirts with a danger, he sports with an ill,
To fear such a stranger is brave hearted Bill.
For Bill is a bright boy ; who is like Bill ?
Oft have I marched with him up and down hill,
When I hear his voice calling I follow him still,
And, standing or falling, I conquer with Bill.
END OF PART I.


PART 11.
VOYAGE TO THE NORTHERN SEAS
?TTP, up! let us a voyage take?
Vs*. Why sit we here at ease 1
Find us a vessel tight and snug
Bound for the Northern Seas.
I long to see the Northern Lights
With their rushing splendours fly
Like living things with flaming wings
Wide o?er the wondrous sky ;
I long to see those icebergs vast
With heads all crowned with snow,
Whose green roots sleep in the awful deep
Two hundred fathoms low ;
I long to hear the thund?ring crash
Of their terrific fall,
And the echoes from a thousand cliff's
Like lonely voices call.
There shall we see the fierce white bear,
The sleepy seals aground,
And the spouting whales that to and fro
Sail with a dreary sound ;
There may we tread on depths of ice
That the hairy mammoth hide,
Perfect as when, in times of old,
The mighty creature died ;


And while the unsetting sun shines on
Through the still heaven?s deep blue,
We?ll traverse the azure waves, the herds
Of the dread sea-horse to view.
We?ll pass the shores of solemn pine,
Where wolves and black bears prowl,
And away to the rocky isles of mist
To rouse the northern fowl.
And there in wastes of the silent sky,
With silent earth below,
We shall see far off to his lonely rock
The lonely eagle go.
Then softly, softly will we tread
By inland streams to see
Where the corm?rant of the silent north
Sits there all silently.
We?ve visited the northern clime,
Its cold and ice-bound main ;
But we gladly turn to a dearer land?
To Australia, back again !
FEIGNED COURAGE.
[Mart Lamb.]
�ORATIO, of ideal courage vain,
Was flourishing in air his father?s cane,
And, as the fumes of valour swelled his pate,
Now thought himself this hero, and now that ;
? And now,? he cried, ? I will Achilles be ;
My sword I brandish, see, the Trojans flee.
Now I?ll be Hector when his angry blade
A lane through heaps of slaughtered Grecians made !
d 2


And now by deeds still braver I?ll convince
I am no less than Edward the Black Prince,
Give way, ye coward French! ? As thus he spoke,
And aimed in fancy a sufficient stroke
To fix the fate of Cressy or Poictiers
(The nurse relates the hero?s fate with
He struck his milk-white hand against a nail,
Sees his own blood, and feels his courage fail.
Ah ! where is now that boasted valour flown,
That in the tented field so late was shown?
Achilles weeps, great Hector hangs his head !
And the Black Prince goes whimpering to bed.
PRIDE.
aOME, come, Mr. Peacock, you must not be proud,
Although you can boast such a train,
For there?s many a bird far more highly endowed,
And not half so conceited and vain.
Let me tell you, gay bird, that a suit of fine clothes
Is a sorry distinction at most,
And seldom much valued excepting by those
Who only such graces can boast.
The nightingale certainly wears a plain coat,
But she cheers and delights with her song;
While you, though so vain, cannot utter a note
To please by the use of your tongue.
The hawk cannot boast of a plumage so gay,
But more piercing and clear is her eye;
And while you are strutting about all the day,
She gallantly soars in the sky.


The dove may be clad in a plainer attire,
But she is not so selfish and cold ;
And her love and affection more pleasure inspire
Than all your fine purple and gold.
So, you see, Mr. Peacock, you must not be proud,
Although you can boast such a train,
For many a bird is more highly endowed,
And not half so conceited and vain.
SOWING AND REAPING.
[Adelaide A. Procter.]
(By permission of G. Bell fy Sons, London.)
CTOW with a generous hand;
A?/ Pause not for toil or pain;
Weary not through the heat of summer;
Weary not through the cold spring rain;
But wait till the autumn comes
For the sheaves of golden grain.
Scatter the seed, and fear not,
A table will be spread;
What matter if you are too weary
To eat your hard-earned bread :
Sow; while the earth is broken,
For the hungry must be fed.
Sow; while the seeds are lying
In the warm earth?s bosom deep,
And your warm tears fall upon it,
They will stir in their quiet sleep;
And the green blades rise the quicker,
Perchance, for the tears you weep.


Then sow ; for the hours are fleeting,
And the seed must fall to-day ;
And care not what hands shall reap it,
Or if you shall have passed away
Before the waving cornfields
Shall gladden the sunny day.
Sow ; and look onward, upward,
Where the starry light appears?
Where, in spite of the coward?s doubting,
Or your own heart?s trembling fears,
You shall reap in joy the harvest
You have sown to.-day in tears.
A FACT.
(From Good Words.)
IT was on an English summer day,
Some six or seven years ago,
That a pointsman before his cabin paced
With a listless step and slow.
He lit his pipe?there was plenty of time?
In his work was nothing new :
Just to watch the signals and shift the points
When the next train came in view.
He leant ?gainst his cabin and smoked away?
He was used to lounge and wait ;
Twelve hours at a stretch he must mind those points,
And down-trains were mostly late.
A rumble, a roar?? She is coming now ;
She?s truer to time to-day ! ?
He turns, and not far off, between the rails,
Sees his youngest boy at play !


Not far, but too far! The train is at hand,
And the child is crawling there,
And patting the ground with crows of delight?
And not a moment to spare !
His face was dead-white, but his purpose tirm,
As straight to his post he trod,
And shifted the points, and saved the down-train,
And trusted his child to God !
There?s a rush in his ears though the train has passed,
He gropes, for he cannot see,
To the place where the laughing baby crawled,
Where the mangled limbs must be.
But he hears a cry that is only of fear ?
His joy seems too great to bear;
For, his duty done, God saw to his son?
The train had not touched a hair.
THE MOUNTAIN AND THE SQUIRREL.
[Ralph Waldo Emebson.]
AI /HE mountain and the squirrel
a Had a quarrel,
And the former called the latter ? little prig ; ??
Bun replied,
?You are doubtless very big;
But all sorts of things and weather
Must be taken in together
To make up a year,
And a sphere.
And I think it no disgrace
To occupy my place.
If Fm not so large as you,


2he Concert in the Wood
You are not so small as I,
And not half so spry.
I?ll not deny you make
A very pretty squirrel track.
Talents differ; all is well and wisely put;
If I cannot carry forests on my back,
Neither can you crack a nut.?
THE CONCERT IN THE WOOD.
Q CONCERT once by Mr, Spring
Q Was given in the wood,
He begged both old and young to come,
And all to sing who could,
Miss Lark, the music to begin,
Her favorite ballad sang,
A well-known air, and liked by all,
So clear her sweet voice rang.
And next a gentleman appeared,
Come lately from abroad.
His song was short, but much admired,
And so it was encored.
He said that Cuckoo was his name,
His style was quite his own ;
He sang most kindly while he stayed,
But all too soon was gone.
The Finches then were asked to sing;
Would they get up a glee
With Mr. Linnet and his wife,
Who sing so prettily ?
And in the chorus many more
No doubt would take a part;
Young Blackcap has a splendid voice,
And sings with all his heart.


Now came the much-expected guest,
Young Lady Nightingale,
So late, that everybody feared
She really meant to fail.
At first she said she could not sing,
She was afraid to try;
But then she sang, and all the air
Was filled with melody.
The guests were charmed, and begged for more;
She said she could not stay;
But still she sang one other song,
And then she went away.
Then Mr. Blackbird a duet
Began with Mrs. Thrush ;
They sang so well, that all were glad
To gather round the bush.
And so they sang, and still sing on ;
And all who music love,
Should lose no time, but go and hear
The concert in the grove.
There is no entrance-fee to pay ;
All guests are welcome there,
Who come with simple, thankful hearts,
In joys like these to share.
BOYS? RIGHTS.
I WONDER now if any one
In this broad land has heard
In favour of downtrodden boys
A solitary word !
We hear enough of ?women?s rights,?
And ? rights of working men,?


Of ?equal rights? and ? nations? rights,?
But you just tell me when
Boys? rights were ever spoken of!
Why we?ve become so used
To being snubbed by everyone,
And slighted and abused,
That when one is polite to us
We stare with all our eyes,
And stretch them in astonishment
To nearly twice their size !
Boys seldom dare to ask boy friends
To venture in the house,
For ?tisn?t natural at all
To creep round like a mouse.
And if we forget ourselves,
And make one bit of noise,
Then some good Auntie quick would say
? Oh my ! those dreadful boys !?
The girls may the piano thum
All day, but it the boys
Play just one tune with fife and drum
It?s, ? Stop that horrid noise ! ?
Insulted thus, we lose no time
In beating a retreat,
So off we go to romp and tear
And scamper in the street.
Perhaps that text the preacher quotes
Sometimes, ? Train up a child,?
Means only train the little girls,
And let the boys run wild ;
But patience, boys, the time will come
When we shall all be men;
And when it does I rather think
Wrongs will be righted then.


THE OLD ARMCHAIR.
[Eliza Cook.]
ILOVE it, I love it! and who shall dare
To chide me for loving that old armchair ?
I?ve treasured it long as a sainted prize, [sighs.
I?ve bedewed it with tears, and embalmed it with
?Tis bound by a thousand bands to my heart?
Not a tie will break, not a link will start.
Would ye learn the spell ??A mother sat there ;
And a sacred thing is that old armchair.
In childhood?s hour I lingered near
The hallowed seat with listening ear,
And gentle words that mother would give
To fit me to die and teach me to live;
She told me that shame would never betide
With truth for my creed and God for my guide;
She taught me to lisp my earliest prayer
As I knelt beside that old armchair.
I sat and watched her many a day
When her eye grew dim and her locks were grey;
And I almost worshipped her when she smiled,
And turned from her Bible to bless her child.
Years rolled on ; but the last one sped?
My idol was shattered, my earth-star fled ;
I learnt how much the heart can bear
When I saw her die in that old armchair.
?Tis past, ?tis past! but I gaze on it now
With quivering breath and throbbing brow ;
?Twas there she nursed me, ?twas there she died,
And memory flows with lava tide.


Say it is folly, and deem me weak,
While the scalding drops start down my cheek ;
But I love it, I love it! and cannot tear
My soul from a mother?s old armchair.
THE FLAMINGO.
�AVE you ever heard
Of the creature absurd,
The ridiculous bird, the flamingo ;
With neck long and slim,
And legs lean and trim,
And the funniest sort of a lingo ?
When a fishing he goes,
He thrusts in his nose,
This humourous bird, the flamingo ;
Without bait or hook,
His long neck a-crook,
Aloft in the air see his wing go!
A plunge and a dive,
And a fish all alive,
This wonderful bird, the flamingo,
Brings out to the land,
And gobbles off-hand ?
In a twinkle he makes the whole thing go.
Then his mate, the old woman,
As though she were human,
And not an old growling flamingo,
For lack of her share
Sets up a great flare,
And makes everything in din go.


But a screech loud and shrill
Comes out of the bill
Of the masculine bird, the flamingo ;
His eyelids both close,
And he stands on the toes
Of one leg?he?s asleep, by jingo !
THE WILD CHERRY TREE.
[Babet Cornwall.]
@H, there never was yet so fair a thing,
By racing river or bubbling spring,
Nothing that ever so gaily grew
Up from the ground when the skies were blue,
Nothing so brave, nothing so free,
As thou ?my wild, wild, cherry tree!
Jove! how it danced in the gusty breeze !
Jove ! how it frolicked amongst the trees !
Dashing the pride of the poplar down,
Stripping the thorn of its hoary crown !
Oak or ash?what matter to thee ?
?Twas the same to my wild, wild cherry tree!
Never at rest, like one that?s young ;
Abroad to the winds its arms it flung,
Shaking its bright and crowndd head,
Whilst I stole up for its berries red ;
Beautiful berries ! beautiful tree !
Hurrah ! for the wild, wild cherry tree !
Back I fly to the days gone by,
And I see thy branches against the sky !
I see in the grass thy blossoms shed,
I see (nay, I taste) thy berries red,
And I shout?like the tempest loud and free?
Hurrah ! for the wild, wild, cherry tree !


Stay-at-home Travellers
STAY-AT-HOME TRAVELLERS.
I HAVE no need of a stately ship,
No fear of a rolling sea ;
In chosen books I take my trip
With the goodliest company.
And whether I read of southern skies,
Or the wealth of an eastern port,
I may see the world through an author a eyes
May dwell in camp or court.
Through wonderful sketch-books that belong
To an artist friend of mine,
I visit the places of legend and song
So famous along the Rhine;
I breathe the spirit of old romance
As I sail along the northern main ;
I tread the vine-clad vales of France,
And look for my castles in Spain.
The song of Venetian gondoliers,
As they guide their moonlit boats,
I seem to hear, or the mountaineer?s
Tyrolean echo notes ;
I may see the heather?s purple plumes
Among the banks and braes,
Or wander where the primrose blooms
Along the English ways.
I seek the land of the midnight sun,
Or trace the source of the Nile ;
I find the cedars of Lebanon,
Or study Crete awhile.
Whenever I tire of time and tide,
No matter how far I roam,


I have only to lay my book aside
To find myself at home.
The world is wide, and the world is fair,
And heroes good to see,
But a hearth and home, and friends to share,
Are all the world to me ;
And to sigh in vain for foreign sight
There surely is no need
As long as people live to write
And I may live to read !
THE AGED STRANGER.
[Bret Harte.]
(An Incident of the War.)
U T WAS with Grant ? ?the stranger said.
-*? Said the farmer, ? Say no more,
But rest thee here at my cottage porch,
For thy feet are weary and sore.?
? I was with Grant ? ?the stranger said.
Said the farmer, ? Nay, no more :
I prithee sit at my frugal board,
And eat of my humble store.
?How fares my boy?my soldier boy,
Of the old Ninth Army Corps 1
I warrant he bore him gallantly
In the smoke and the battle?s roar ! ?
? I know him not,? said the aged man ;
? And, as I remarked before,
I was with Grant??? Nay, nay, I know,?
Said the farmer ; ?say no more.


? How fell he?with his face to the foe,
Upholding the flag he bore 1
Oh ! say not that my boy disgraced
The uniform that he wore !
?He fell in battle?l see, alas !
Thou?dst smooth these tidings o?er,?
Nay ; speak the truth, whatever it be,
Though it rend my bosom?s core.?
? I cannot tell,? said the aged man,
? And should have remarked, before,
That I was with Grant ?in Illinois?
Some three years before the war.?
Then the farmer spake him never a word,
But beat with his fist fall sore
That aged man, who had worked for Grant
Some three years before the war.
THE WOULD-BE TRAVELLERS.
[Marian Douglas.]
Arthur ?
@H ! if I had only a pair
Of Indian snow-shoes I could wear,
The storms might beat, the winds might blow,
Across the drifts I?d northward go,
And see the Northland?s splendid sights?
The red and green and yellow lights,
That up the sky at night-time stream;
The icebergs on the sea that gleam,
And, peering from his hut of snow,
In walrus coat, the Esquimau ;
And with my loud hurrah I'd scare
From his den the grizzly bear !


Bertha?
And if I only had a boat,
I?d spread my sail and eastward float,
And see the far-off Eastern lands,
The palm-trees and the desert sands,
The camels and the caravans;
Tall shining towers and curious towns,
And men with turbans on, and gowns ;
And bring home, lovely to behold,
A charming dress of cloth-of-gold.
Dick?
And, if I only had a horse,
I?d westward, westward take my course ;
With flying feet and floating mane
He?d gallop with me o?er the plain ;
As lightly as the wind we?d pass
Across the waving prairie-grass.
And strange, tall blossoms, blue and red,
Would nod about my horse?s head.
Elsie?
And, if I had some wings to fly,
I?d southward soar along the sky,
And see the Southland all aglow.
With roses, when with us there?s snow ;
And flutter down to rest me, where
The starry myrtle scents the air,
And humming birds dart out and in
The blossoms of the jessamine ;
Where his green mate the parrot calls,
And oranges, like golden balls,
Hang on the boughs, I?d spend the hours
In gathering figs and plucking flowers.


Little Susy?
Oh, if you want to, and you can,
I?m willing you should roam ;
But I?m dear mother?s little girl,
I?ll stay with her at home.
WOODEN LEGS.
[By "A.?]
H7WO children sat in the twilight,
Murmuring soft and low :
Said one, ? I?ll be a sailor-lad,
With my boat ahoy ! yo ho !
For sailors are loved most of all
In every happy home,
And tears of grief or gladness fall
Just as they go or come.?
But the other child said sadly,
? Ah, do not go to sea,
Or in the dreary winter nights
What will become of me ?
For if the wind began to blow,
Or thunder shook the sky.
Whilst you were in your boat, yo ho!
What could I do but cry 1 ?
Then he said, ? I?ll be a soldier,
With a delightful gun ;
And I?ll come home with a wooden leg,
As heroes have often done.?
She screams at that, and prays and begs
While tears ?half anger?start,
? Don?t talk about your wooden legs
Unless you?d break my heart.! ?


He answered her rather proudly,
? If so, what can I be,
If I must not have a wooden leg,
And must not go to sea 1
How could the Queen sleep sound at night,
Safe from the scum and dregs,
If English boys refused to fight
In fear of wooden legs ? ?
She hung her head repenting,
And trying to be good,
But her little hand stroked tenderly
The leg of flesh and blood !
And with her rosy mouth she kissed
The knickerbocker?d knee,
And sighed, ? Perhaps, if you insist,
You?d better go to sea.?
Then he flung his arms about her,
And laughingly he spoke,
? But I?ve seen many honest tars
With legs of British oak.
Oh, darling ! when I am a man,
With beard of shining black,
I?ll be a hero if I can,
And you must not hold me back.?
She kissed him as she answered,
? I?ll try what I can do?
And Wellington had both his legs,
And Cceur de Lion too.
And Garibaldi,? here she sighed,
? I know he?s lame ?but there,
He?s such a hero ?none beside
Like him could do and dare! ?


So the children talked in the twilight
Of many a setting sun,
And she?d stroke his chin, and clap her hands,
That the beard had not begun ;
For though she meant to be brave and good,
When he played a hero?s part,
Yet often the thought of the leg of wood
Hung heavy on her heart!
A STORY BY THE FIRE.
[Doea GtEEENWELL.]
aHILDREN love to hear of children !
I will tell of a little child
Who dwelt alone with his mother
By the edge of a forest wild.
One summer eve from the forest,
Late, late down the grassy track,
The child came back with lingering step,
And looks oft turning back.
? Oh, mother! ? he said, ?in the forest
I have met with a little child;
All day he played with me?all day
He talked with me and smiled.
At last he left me alone, but then
He gave me this rosebud red,
And said he would come to me again
When all its leaves were spread.
? I will put my rosebud in a glass,
I will watch it night and day ;
Dear little friend, wilt thou come again?
Wilt thou come by my side to play ?


I will seek for strawberries?the best
Of all shall be tor thee ;
I will show thee the eggs in the linnet?s nest
None knoweth of but me.?
At morn, beside the window-sill,
Awakes a bird?s clear song ;
But all within the house was still?
The child was sleeping long.
The mother went to the little room?
With all its leaves outspread,
She saw a rose in fullest bloom,
And in the little bed
A child that did not breathe or stir?
A happy little child
Who had met his little friend again,
And in the meeting smiled.
THE LITTLE BOY I DREAMED ABOUT.
[Mbs. S. M. B. Piatt, from Harper's Bazaar.']
\ | /HIS is the only world I know;
It is in this same world, no doubt.
Ah, me ! but I could love him so
If I could only find him out,
The little boy I dreamed about!
This little boy, who never takes
The prettiest orange he can see,
The reddest apple, all the cakes
(When there are twice enough for three) ?
Where can the darling ever be 1


He does not tease, and storm, and pout
To climb the roof in rain and sun,
And pull the pigeon?s leathers out
To see how it will look with none,
Or fight the hornets, one by one.
He does not hide, and cut his hair,
And wind the watches wrong, and try
To throw the kitten down the stair
To see how often it can die
(It?s strange that you can wonder why)
If I said ? Go,? he would not stay
To lose his hat or break a toy,
Then hurry like the wind away,
And whistle like the wind for joy,
To please himself?this little boy.
Let any stranger come who can,
He will not say?if it is true ?
? Old lady ? or ? old gentleman,?
? I wish you would go home, I do;
I think my mamma wantsjyou to ! ?
No ! Fairy-land is far and dim :
He does not play in silver sand;
But if I could believe in him,
I could believe in Fairy-land,
Because?do you not understand ?
Dead ? dead ? Somehow I do not know.
The sweetest children die. We may
Miss some foot-print from the snow
That was his very own to-day?
? God?s will ? is what the Christians say,


Like you, or you, or you can be,
When you are good, he looks, no doubt.
I?d give the goldenest star I see
In all the dark to find him out ?
The little boy I dreamed about.
MEASURING THE BABY.
WE measured the riotous baby
Against the cottage wall,
A lily grew at the threshold,
And the boy was just as tall.
A royal tiger-lily,
With spots of purple and gold
And the heart of a jewelled chalice,
The fragrant dew to hold.
Without the bluebirds whistled,
High up in the old roof-trees ;
And to and fro at the window
The red rose rocked her bees.
And the wee pink fists of the baby
Were never a moment still,
Snatching at shine and shadow
That danced at the lattice-sill.
His eyes were as wide as bluebells,
His mouth like a flower unblown,
Two little bare feet, like funny white mice,
Peeped out from his snowy gown ;
And we thought with a thrill of rapture,
That yet had a touch of pain,
When June rolls round with her roses
We?ll measure the boy again.


Ah, me ! in a darkened chamber,
With the sunshine shut away,
Through tears that fell like a bitter rain,
We measured the boy to-day;
And the little bare feet that were dimpled,
And sweet as a budding rose,
Lay side by side together,
In the hush of a long repose.
Up from the dainty pillow,
White as the risen dawn,
The fair little face lay smiling,
With the light of heaven thereon;
And the dear little hands, like rose leaves
Dropped from a rose, lay still,
Never to catch at the sunshine
That crept to the shrouded sill.
We measured the sleeping baby
With ribbons white as snow,
For the shining rosewood casket
That waited him below;
And out of the darkened chamber
We went with a childless moan?
To the height of the sinless angels
Our little one had grown.
RED RIDING-HOOD.
[A. L.l
[Rhymes and Dialogues for Kindergarten Schools. London : George
Philip & Son.]
ONE summer day, long, long ago,
When beasts could talk like us, you know,
A little girl, called Red Riding-hood,
Went to her grandma?s through the wood.


She went to take
Some butter and cake,
And a posy of flowers she stayed to make.
Her little dog Fido ran by her side,
Or scampered before, her steps to guide.
A great big wolf lay under a tree;
?Good morning, Red Riding-hood,? said he ;
? Good morning, Sir,? said the brave little maid,
Although she felt just a little afraid.
? And where are you going, my little Red-hood ? ?
? I?m going to grandma?s through the wood ;
Poor granny is ill, and I?m going to take
This posy of flowers and some butter and cake.?
? I hope you?ll find her better,? said he;
? Oh, thank you, Mr. Wolf! ? said she.
Then off he ran at a gallopy trot,
And soon he came to grandma?s cot,
And tapped at the door as soft as he could;
? Who?s there 1 ? ? I?m little Red Riding-hood.?
? Come in, my child ! ? so in he goes,
And grandma trembled from head to toes!
? Now, out you come ! Get under the bed;
But lend me a night-cap first,? he said;
? A cap and gown just like your own; ?
Poor granny obeyed with many a groan !
Then she crept under, and he got in,
And pulled the bed-clothes up to his chin.
A tap at the door?? Come in, my dear,?
Says the wolf in a voice that was hoarse and queer.
So in comes Riding-hood up to the bed,
And stares at the wolf?s big night-capped head :
? Oh, Granny ! how big your eyes have grown ! ?
? The better to see you with, my own! ?
? Oh, Granny ! how long your nose has got! ?
? The better to smell the soup in the pot! ?


? Oh, Granny ! your ears are long to-day ! ?
? The better to hear what you?ve got to say ! ?
? Oh, Granny ! your mouth is large and queer ! ?
? The better to kiss you with, my dear! ?
? Oh, Granny ! what sharp, long teeth ! ? she said ;
? The better to eat you ! ? then out of the bed,
He sprang at the child with a terrible howl,
While Fido set up such an angry growl;
Barked ? Wolf! wolf! wolf ! ? then pulled him down,
His feet all entangled in grandma?s gown.
Gripped by the throat, he tumbled about,
While little Red Riding-hood ran out,
And hurried along as fast as she could
To the blacksmith?s forge by the side of the wood.
? Wolf! wolf! ? she cried ; ? Oh, come and see !
There?s a wolf at granny?s?do kill him for me!?
Off the smith went, though his iron was hot,
And soon got with her to grandma?s cot ;
He raised his hammer high over his head,
Then down with a bang?and the wolf was dead !
And grandma crept from under the bed,
And Fido was kissed and fondled and fed,
And the smith went home and told his wife
How he and the dog saved Red Riding-hood?s life !
MASTER JOHNNY?S NEIGHBOUR.
[Bbet Haute.]
IT was spring the first time that I saw her, for her
papa and mamma moved in
Next door, just as skating was over and marbles about
to begin,


For the fence in our back yard was broken, and I saw,
as I peeped through the slot,
There were ?Johnny Jump-ups? all around, and I
knew it was spring-time by that.
I never knew whether she saw me, for she didn?t say
nothing to me,
But ?Ma ! here?s a slot in the fence broke and the
boy that is next door can see.?
But the next day I climbed on our wood-shed, as you
know mamma says I?ve a right,
And she called out, ? Well, peeken is manners ! ? and
I answered her, ? Sass is perlite ! ?
But I wasn?t a bit mad, no, papa, and to prove it the
very next day,
When she ran past our fence in the morning, I
happened to get in her way,
For you know I am chunked and clumsy, as she says
are all boys of my size,
And she nearly upset me, she did, pa, and laughed
till tears came in her eyes.
And then we were friends from that moment, for I
knew that she told Kitty Sage,
And she wasn?t a girl that would flatter, ? That she
thought I was tall for my age.?
And I gave her four apples that evening, and took
her to ride on my sled,
And?? what am I telling you this for 1 ? Why, papa,
my neighbour is dead !
You don?t hear one-half lam saying?l really do
think it too bad !
Why you might have seen crape on her door-knob,
and noticed to-day I?ve been sad.
And they?ve got her a coffin of rosewood, and they
say they have dressed her in white,
And I?ve never once looked through the fence, pa,
since she died at eleven last night.


And ma says its decent and proper, as I was her
neighbour and friend,
That I should go there to the funeral, and she thinks
that you ought to attend ;
But I am so clumsy and awkward, I know I shall be
in the way,
And suppose they should speak to me, papa, I
wouldn?t know just what to say.
So I think I will get up quite early, I know I sleep
late; but I know
I?ll be sure to wake up if our Bridget pulls the string
that I?ll tie to my toe.
And I?ll crawl through the fence, and I?ll gather the
?Johnny Jump-ups? as they grew
Round her feet the first day that I saw her, and,
papa, I?ll give them to you.
For you?re a big man and you know, pa, can come
and go just where you choose,
And you?ll take the flowers to her, pa, won?t you ?
and surely they?ll never refuse;
But, papa, don?t say they?re from Johnny; they won?t
understand, don?t you see ?
But just lay them down on her bosom, and, papa,
she?ll know they?re from me.
?ONE DIP!?
[Chas. Lamb.]
mUCH speech obscures the sense ; the soul of wit
ls brevity?our tale one proof of it.
Poor Balbulus, a stammering invalid,
Consults the doctors, and by them is bid
To try sea-bathing, with this special heed?
? One dip was all his malady did need ;


More than that one his certain death would be ! ?
Now who so nervous or so shook as he,
For Balbulus had never dipped before 1
Two well-known dippers, at the Broadstairs shore,
Stout sturdy churls, had stript him to the skin,
And naked, cold, and shivering plunge him in.
Soon he emerges with scarce breath to say,
?Fmto be dip-dip-dipt .? ?We know it,? they
Reply. Expostulation seemed in vain,
And over ears they souse him in again;
And up again he rises ; his words trip,
And falter as before?still ? dip-dip-dip ! ?
And in he goes again with furious plunge,
Once more to rise ; when with a desperate lunge
At length he bolts these words out, ? Only once /?
The villains crave his pardon ! Had the dunce
But aimed at these bare words the rogues had found
him ;
But striving to be prolix, they half-drowned him !
THE PARSON?S DAUGHTER.
[Julia C. B. Doer.]
U rjj-xO! ho ! ? he cried, as up and down
. i iL He rode through the streets of Windham town ;
? Ho ! ho ! for the day of peace is done,
And the day of wrath too well begun !
Bring forth the grain from your barns and mills,
Drive forth the cattle from off your hills ;
For Boston lieth in sore distress,
Pallid with hunger and long duress?
Her children starve, while she hears the beat
And tramp of red-coats in every street.?


*' What, ho ! what, ho! ? Like a storm unspent,
Over the hill-sides he came and went;
And Parson White, from his open door
Leaning, bareheaded, that August day,
While the sun beat down on his temples grey,
Watched him until he could see no more.
Then straight he rode to the church and flung
His whole soul into the peal he rung ;
Pulling the bell-rope, till the tower
Seemed to rock in the sudden shower.
The shower of sound the farmers heard
Rending the air like a living word !
Then swift they gathered with right good will
From field to anvil, and shop and mill,
To hear what the parson had to say,
That would not keep till the Sabbath day ;
For only the women and children knew
The tale of the horseman galloping through?
The message he bore, as up and down
He rode through the streets of Windham town.
That night, as the parson sat at ease
In the porch, with the Bible on his knees
(Thanking God that at break of day
Frederic Manning would take his way
With cattle and sheep from off the hills,
And loads of grain from the barns and mills
To the starving city where General Gage
Waited unholy war to wage);
His little daughter beside him stood,
Hiding her face in her muslin hood ;
In her arms her own pet lamb she bore,
As it struggled down to the oaken floor.


?It must go; I must give my lamb,? she said,
? To the children that cry for meat and bread ! ?
Then lifted to him her holy eyes,
Wet with the tears of sacrifice.
? Nay, nay,? he answered, ?there is no need
That the hearts of babes should ache and bleed ;
Run away to your bed, and to-morrow play,
You and your pet, through the livelong day.??
But when the heralds of morning came,
Flushing the East with rosy flame,
With low of cattle and scurry of feet,
Driving his herd down the village street,
Young Manning heard from a low stone wall
A child?s voice clearly yet softly call,
And saw in the gray dusk, standing there
A little maiden with shining hair,
While, crowding close to her tender side
Was a snow-white lamb to her apron tied.
? Oh, wait! ? she cried, ? for my lamb must go
To the children crying in want and woe,
It is all I have.? And the tears fell fast
As she gave it one eager kiss?her last.
? The road will be long to it?s feet, I pray
Let your arms be its bed a part of the way,
And give it cool water and tender grass,
Whenever a wayside brook you pass.?
Then away she flew like a startled deer,
Nor waited the bleat of her lamb to hear.
Young Manning lifted his steel-blue eyes
One moment up to the morning skies,
Then, raising the lamb to his breast, he strode
Sturdily down the lengthened road.


? Now God be my Helper,? he cried, ? and lead
Me safe with my charge to the souls in need!
Through fire and flood, through dearth and dole,
Though foes assail me, and war-clouds roll,
To the city in want and woe that lies,
I will bear this lamb of sacrifice! ?
LITTLE TOMMY ON ?GHOSTS.?
TT7HESE ghosts, it seems, are like little boys, who
they say, ? Should be seen and not heard.?
That is, they don?t speak, but they stamp and clank
chains, which seems regular right down absurd.
For if they can glare, and goggle, and make shindies,
and rattle among doorways and dishes,
Why can?t they speak up like spirits and just
tell us their wante and their wishes 1
That?s why I don?t believe in ?em, though they frighten
me awfully ! This does seem ri-dik-u-lus, rather ;
But I find it?s precisely the same with the grown-ups.
For instance, there?s Billy Bumps? father,
He pooh-poohs all ghosts, in a big bouncing voice,
and says they?re all nervses and liver;
Yet when Uncle Jack was a-telling of ?em on Christ-
mas Eve, I could see he was all of a shiver,
Mr. Bumps, I mean, and his face went the color of a
pan of skim milk in our dairy,
And when he was a going he run against someone in
the passage, and he shrieked, and it was only
our Mary.
That?s how it seems with everyone. These ghosts
are too stoopid to believe in, but they do make
you creepy,
And?l?m almost quite afraid to go to bed after all
this, though I?m awfully, awfully sleepy !
