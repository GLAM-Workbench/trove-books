On, Australians, On!
(The poem from which our heroes who landed at
the Dardanelles adopted their war cry, ?On
Australians.?)
William J. Mac Donald.
Comrades, fighting foes are falling
In the face of fire appalling.
Hark! It is our Country calling?
On, Australians, on!
Our land hath been thrall to no men,
Ne?er hath known the feet of foemen;
On! It is a glorious omen?
On, Australians, on!
Grim the battlefield and gory;
On for hearths and homes and glory!
Kindle nations with our story?
On, Australians, on!
See our brothers nobly waging
Where the fiercest fight is raging,
Gallantly with hosts engaging?
On, Australians, on!
Myriads our ranks assailing,
Still we meet them without quailing;
All their numbers-unavailing?
On, Australians,'on!
Rock of lance and bayonet flashing,
Foes against it furious crashing,
Shattered are like breakers dashing?
On, Australians, on!
Us and liberty who?ll sever?
God, the cause that?s right, spurns never;
Freedom and our flag for ever?
On, Australians, on!
