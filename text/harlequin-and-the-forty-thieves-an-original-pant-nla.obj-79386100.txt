TO PURCHASERS OF
SINGER
SEWING MACHINES
With Triple-action Balance Wheel !
This improvement consists of an attachment to the shaft of the
balance-wheel by means of which the bobbins can be wound without
running other parts of the Machine, thus saving not only much wear
and tear to the more delicate mechanical parts, but also the most
tiresome labor connected with Machine Sewing. Another advantage
consists in the non-breakage of thread when by accident the wheel
as started in the wrong direction. The balance-wheel, with the
[ attachment added, is known to be as the
TRIPLE-ACTION WHEEL.
It is INSTANTANEOUSLY SELF-ADJUSTING- and possesses
most decided advantages over the fast and loose wheels hitherto
?offered the public
The cost of this attachment (which is a fixture on the machine, and.
cannot be added to a shaft and wheel not especially prepared for it)
is FtVfi SHILLINGS (ss-), consequently the Catalogue Price
of each
NEW FAMILY MACHINE
In any style, will be increased to that extent.
For example; ? _ _ ,
The Machine, on plain Walnut t able, is catalogued at <�7 103 Ofl.
Add charge for attachment aud the price will be 15s Q4
Knowing that the Triple-action Wheel possesses all the merit we
claim for it, we confidently recommend it to intending purchasers,
and though the necessity of the extra charge may be a source of
some regret to our patrons, a little experience will satisfy them how
amply they are compensated by the saving of wear to the Machine
r and of labor to the Machinist.
The Triple-action is not applied to Medium or Manufactueing
Machines.

THE FORTY THIEVES.
Scene I. ?Market Place at Pag dad.
Concerted Piece. ?? The Bi?igands.?
Abdallah i Some charity, good people,
Hassarac / We have nought to eat;
Even Paddy?s Market meat,
Or beef, or fluky sheep ?ll
Be to us quite meet,
And an unexpected treat.
Date, then, pro caritate?we are starving, jou are hearty.
Chorus Some charity, good people,
We have nought to eat ?
Even Paddy?s Market meat j
We are so poor and feeble,
We are starving in the street.
Abdallah Well done, good Hassarac ?no one believes
I am the captain of the Forty Thieves ;
In stonewall days of Parliamentry shame,
The ? Age ? declared McCulloch was my name ;
But in this new disguise I?m safe, no doubt?
I?ve got the Forty somewhere here about.
(Blows whistle; the Forty Thieves discover themselves .)
To pay for what we take is needless fuss?
That which belongs to them belongs to us.
Hassarac Than membeis of Assembly we?re no worse;
We but ? appropriate? the Public Purse.
Abd. Things straight are wrong ?the line of beauty?s curved
Hass. Like Berry?s conscience
Abd. Soft ?we are observed.
Hass. My word!
Fnter Ali Baba from his stall.
Ali 111 luck as usual. There, it?s no use trying;
I go on selling, no one goes on buying.
{Calls) Ganem, my boy, trade?s very flat.
Ganem {Advancing) Yes, rather;
Ali We may as well shut up, boy.
Ganem All right, father.
Ali Fortune has played your parent curious tricks,
Reduced him to chop wood and cut up sticks,
Hard work all day that very little pays ?
What very different fates have M.L.A.?s !
Ganem Then enter Parliament.


Ali ( Horrified .) Nevarr! That?s flat ;
Though pior, I?m honest; I?ve not sunk to that.
But, Ganem boy, draw near.
Ganem I'm drawing.
Ali Good!
I?ve a design.
Ganem Then cut it on the wood.
Ali The very notion that was in my head ;
Ganem Well, that mated il might be used instead.
Ali At early dawn we?ll seek the forest track
And bring a barkless load of faggots back ;
These in the mart may fetch good valuations,
One donkey?s left me?
Ganem No insinuations.
I'm with you, father ?never mind what weather,
It?s an appointment, and we chop together.
But Uncle Cassim?s very rich, and shouldn?t ?
Ali He?d see ire starve first, boy, and then he wouldn?t ;
He?s of the wealthy lower order kidney ;
He gave the Indian Fund no thousand.
Ganem Didn? he ?
(Abdallah and Hassarac, loitering and listening , deprive Ali
Ganem of their pocket handkerchiefs.)
Abd. Excuse me?ls this yours, sir, ?red and yellow ?
Hass. Dropped this I think.
Ali and Ganem A very civil fellow.
Abd. I thought it must be yours, beyond a doubt.
Hass. You should take cure ; so many thieves about.
When o?er the land revival frauds are sweeping
You on your purse close watch had best be keeping.
Ali Though Cassim?s rich, for aid I can?t rely on him.
Abd. Rich, is he ? Hassarac, we must keep our eye on him.
Ali Here comes my brother?s wife.
Ganem Yes, I suppose
When up in life, we show it by the nose.
Enter Cogia Baba.
Cogia Well, through the market-place a walk we?ll take,
And see what kind of bargains we can make ;
A Persian shawl, if marked in figures plain,
Might suit me. Oh, here?s brother-in-law again.
Ali I know I?m only a poor working man.
Cogia {Calls) Here, Morgiana, quickly bring my fan.
Enter Mobgiana with fan.
Morgiana Here is your fan, my lady.
Cogia We?ll you?ve said it.
Morgi. Yes, ma?am, I?ve got it, ma?am, but but a
Cogia Spread it.
Morgi. Yes, ma?am, but master hoped if things you buy
You wouldn?t spend a lot of money.

Extravagant! who brought him all his riches !
I?ll let him know the one who wears the??which is?
Ahem! ?The merchant here, and which the Jew ?
G-anem Oh, Aunty, glad to see you ; how d?ye do ?
Cogia Go away, little boy, your?e very rude.
Ali Sister-in-law, I hope we don?t intrude;
But times are very hard and rent is pressing;
Assist me, and accept a poor man?s blessing.
Qanem Uncle has got a lot?you?d never miss it,
AH Why don?t my brother my poor dwelling visit ?
Cogia Of course poor people never seem contented,
I wonder why they ever were invented.
Air?DON?T TAKE ANY NOTICE.
Ali A splendid shop my brother keeps,
Morgi. And I?m in his employ,
G-anem Of ready cash you both have heaps.
Cogia. Impertinent small boy.
Ali Although we live so very nigh,
Yet him I?ve seldom seen,
Q-anem. I see your game with half an eye,
Cogia Whatever can he mean.
Chorus Don?t take notice he?s only a nephew,
Don?t take any notice the lad may annoy,
I know that his coat is a garment to grieve you.
But pray take no notice, he?s only a boy.
Morgi. She thinks small boys would silent be,
If they have any nous.
Cogia That saucy lad will prove to me,
The Gaunson of my house.
Q-anem. Oh, come I say, pray draw it mild,
I can?t with that put up.
Ali It breaks my heart to hear my child.
Denominated ?pup.?
Chorus Oh poor Jamie Grant, of your brother-in-law sir.
Don?t take any notice ?Let Gaunson Annoy,
All know that he?s terribly given to jaw sir,
But pray take no notice, he?s only a boy.
Enter Cassim Baba.
Cassim What do I hear ? What hard up fellow see
Ali Fellow ! That brother is hard up?on me.
Cassim Begone ! a gentleman in my position,
Could?nt of course know one in that condition.
Ali Oh Ganem, Ganem? feelings I must smother,
How glad I am, you never had a brother,
At Caesim?s house I never meant to call,
But this is the unkindest cut of all.
Ganem Oh dad they are like those dinners that we owe.


Ali What means the boy ?
Ganem - Why stuck-up things you know.
Morgi. Excuse me I don?t hold with such behavings,
I get no wages so I?ve got no savings,
But if this necklace helps when cares pursue you,
Take it and welcome ?much good may it do you,
?Tis a gold collar?many carats fine.
Ali Gold collar?eh ?Fraps collared from Goldstein,
But isn?t she a beautiful young woman ?
She?s what I call a splendid girl,
Oanem Uncommon.
Ali No, keep your necklace, child, while I can work I
Would never take your trinket for all Turkey.
Enter Cadi and Gttabds,
Cadi Attend all ye in market place collected,
See that your goods are properly protected,
Whereas from information we?ve received
A band of robbers ?forty it's believed,
Have lately plundered various Turkish stations,
And otherwise committed depredations,
We must on all such doings put a stopper,
Hass I course sir?very proper?very proper.
Cogia I?ve lost my parcels or my sight deceives,
Cassim Help ! I?ve been robbed.
Chorus Those precious forty thieves
Chorus ?COMO QUADRILLES.
Soon these scoundrels rash,
Here will make a smash ;
For these forty larrikins cut a fearful dash,
Taking all our cash,
And with awful gash,
Settling in a brace of shakes, each Bagdaddy's hash.
Cadi, let martial bobbies? tread,
Fill the forty thieves with dread
Helmets procure like Melbourne traps,
To fright to death those robber chaps.
(Repeat)
Scene 2 ?The Date-Tree Grove.
Enter Ali.
Ali Ah, there?s the forest that provides our load j
Come along, Ganem, this way lies our road.
Come - come and cut away.
Enter Ganem.

How can I come if I?m to cut away ?
A road that lies and goes on without ending,
Appears to me a road in need of mending.
Ali Boy, where?s the]donkey ?
Oh, he waits my whistle ;
I left him yonder dining off a thistle.
Ali He is a Scotchman, or an ass?
Ganem That's true.
Thistles ?sweet Edinburgh, I smell the noo!
A graze will do him good ; ?he?s not built fleshily.
Ali He?s always grazing.
Ganem Grazing shins, especially.
Ali Ah, that reminds me. When?no, not when ?why?
Can you guess conundrums ?
Ganem Well, I?ll try,
Ali Why can a woodman never go astray ?
Because he always can enquire the way,
Ganem If that s a riddle, then it?s very bad.
Ali I know I thought it funny when a lad.
Ganem You haven?t got the proper answer quite ;
Isn?t it something about axing P
Ali Eight!
Of course, that?s it?he axes to be sure !
Ganem Well, don?t you ax conundrums any more.
But come, take too much time that Donkey?s feed does,
Look at his phiz ?you know it
Ali Don?t I ? Eather.
Ganem The very latest, Mr. Mirams? father.
Now then, Mokanna, if you?ve dined, we?re ready ;
Quicken your pace a bit, sir?gee up, Neddy.
Enter Mokanna, the Donkey.
Ali Bless his old ears ;of donkeys he is rex?
John Thomas Smith, with practical effects.
Ganem That joke age cannot wither, custom stale.
Ali Of coarse it can?t, and thereby hangs a tale ;
If in the court of bankruptcy we gets,
That Donkey will be our entire ass-ets.
Ganem His playful ways may seem to need correction,
But that's his way of showing his affection.
Ali Who could speak harshly to a creature mute ?
Now will you come along, you stubborn brute.
This Eastern question?s settled by one blow ;
Is that your ultimatum I would know
Than Eeuter?s telegraph he?s far from able
For nothing interrupts our donkey?s cable.
Ganem I?ll threaten him if you cause all this bother ;
We?ll sell you, Dobbin, and we?ll buy another.
Duet. ?? THE OUD DONKEY.?
When I was a lad I had an oud moke,
And a very fine bred ?un was he ;


His braying was good, and he'd swallow his food,
And he?d prick up his ears at a bee.
He seemed to have sense for a dozen or more,
Yer?d think as he even could talk ;
Yet say what you would and do what you could,
He?d never go out of a walk.
Chorus
You might hit him on this side, and hit him on that
You might pet him and coax him with ta ! k ;
Yet do what you would, it was all no good,
He?d never go out of a walk.
I says to my father ?come, father, and try
If you can make oud donkey trot.
He scratches bis head and looking that sly,
Says Ganem, I would rather not.
Says I, stuff and nonsense ! so at last he consents,
And he goes and he gets a big fork,
And gives the old moke a good thrust in ribs ;
But he wouldn?t go out of a walk.
Chorus You might hit him, &c.
[jExeunt Ali and Ganem, leading Mokanva.
Enter Cogia and Cassim, with Black Boy,
Cogia This is the {lace a picnic to enjoy ;
Under the date trees spread the cloth, my boy.
Only to think ?its just seven years to-day
Since we were manied. How time runs away.
Cassim And so does cash. You buy rich silks and choose them.
And then you like a stupid go and lose them.
Cogia I wouldn't lose the things on purpose, would I ?
If thieves did steal, I couldn?t stop them, could I ?
Cassim I gave the money for the dresses bought.
Cogia And all the money that you gave I brought;
But where?s our slave ? ?lf near I'd have a shake of her,
She?s altered so, I can?t tell what to make of her.
Enter Moegiana.
Morgi. How soft the air, how balmy is the breeze ;
Cogia Come, Morgiana, help me out with these.
Morgi. Why should we wake P.how crushing is reality?
Pickles profane this picturesque locality.
Here I could dwell with rapture on each leaf,
And ne?er ask bounteous nature for cold betf.
Cogia Whatever ails the girl?be moving faster,
Here, take this plate of victuals to your master.
Morgi. A lump of mutton and a crust of bread
Is it with this immmtal man is fed ?
Cassim Como, Morgiana, I say,this won?t do.
Morgi. I thought it wouldn?t?slice, ma?am, number two.
Cogia In washing up the p?ates you?ll find employment,
Wait till we?re done ; now this I call enjoyment.

G-anem I?ve scarcely slept a wink.
Cogia Young persons who
Are soon about to marry seldom do ;
G-anem Strange dreams disturbed me ;
Cogia So I should expect,
?Twas just the same with me, I recollect j
But Morgiana will all dreams dispel;
Ganem Behold, she comes !
Cogia And all becomes her well.
Enter Moegiana.
Morgi. Ganem, whatever you may see or hear,
However strange the strangest things appear,
Whatever stirring incidents may stir,
Whatever odd occurrences occur ?
You promise me ?
Ganem I do,
Morgi) To love me still,
*And take me for thy wedded wife,
Ganem will,
Morgi. What here has happened, it were wiser, rather
To keep at present secret from your father.

Daughter in law, I greet you with a kiss.

Ali Then nought remains, but in the usual way
With song and dance, to celebrate the day.
Abd. You may imagine what you now hare heard,
Is folly, rampant nonsense ?that?s absurd;
Full grown up people jeer at folly?s fling.
But then the children?they do no such thing,
For what we?ve done, and what?s to come hereafter
We?re amply paid, if we but hear their laughter;
And if we have unknown made some mistake,
Pardon our crimes, if but for childhood?s sake.

Morgi. Ganem now my hand receives.
Ganem As to yours say?can I gain ?em ?
Chorus Show of hands in usual way,
In this manner, in this manner,
Show, then in the good old way,
Hands for Morgiana.
Thus, years to come this tale will teach our youth
Naught can contend with fortitude and truth 5
Through you has Justice reached those knaves who steal
Through me the Peri's their bright home reveal.
To other scenes then roam ; this wand translates you
Where fancy beckons and where fun awaits you,
With blythe companions may we all succeed ;
In showing this year we?ve struck oil indeed.

A Cheap Excursion to the Paris International Exhibition and hick, is
said to be under contemplation by some well known speculators of Mel-
bourne. Should their idea be carri d out, a large portion of our com-
munity will, no doubt avail themselves of the opportunity of paying a
visit to the magnificent city of Paris, and to return not only greatly
benefited in health by the voyage, but improved in mind and experience
through their visit. 'lhe expense of such a holiday excursion will be
scarcely felt by those po-sessed of capital, and those who hesitate
simply from the Want of , Funds have only to cull upon
