Found In Circus
con Colleano. mentioned
here as the Australian
high tight-wire acrobat amazing America, was dis-
covered in a circus at Parramatta by Mr. Jack Musgrove,
back in 1923. As manager of the Tivoli Theatre, it was
then the practice of Mr. Musgrove to scout for talent
in unexpected places. When he saw Cooleano throw a
double back un" on the wire, £20 a week and a long
contract were offered the artist. Colleano closed at the
price, but refused to sign for any specified time. His
daring act. the only one of its kind in the world,
crowded the theatre, and soon the salary was doubled.

COMEDIAN FINED FOR
HIS JOKES
rOLICE NOTES MADE IN
THEATRE
Plow police officers in plain clothes
took notes of a stage artist’s “ patter ”
during a theatre performance was de-
scribed at Liverpool, when Alexander
Dennis McLeod, of Arundel-road,
Kingston-on-Thames, Surrey, known as
Tex McLeod, the rope-spinning cowboy
comedian, was fined £5 for using in-
decent language in Shakespeare
Theatre, Liverpool, on February 5. He
pleaded not guilty.
Mr J. R. Bishop, prosecuting, said
Sergeant David W. McKelvie and Con-j
stable Carson attended the first house, |
sitting in the pit stalls, and made notes
of yarns McLeod was spinning while
he was also spinning ropes
Indecency had been defined m the
dictionary as “ offending the
recognised standards of morality.
Sergeant McKelvie, in evidence, re-
lated ten alleged anecdotes from
McLeod’s performance referring to Mr.
Gandhi, Herr Hitler, Mr and Mrs.
Moll is on, a honeymoon couple at Black-
pool, Belisha beacons, Nudist colonies
and a wedding there Miss Mae West
the Invisible Man, and the trees in the
scenery of the theatre.
“CUTTING A GAG”
Sergeant McKelvie said that when
interviewed, McLeod replied It is a
monologue I have, been using in al the
leading theatres m England. This is
the first complaint I .have, had in the
show business. Sometimes if managers
request me to cut a gag, I do so.
McLeod told the court that he hac
been performing in . mus^ ] c i^ 11 T s Tn f t p 5
broadcasting m Britain and the United
States for 17 years without complaint.
“The police sergeant has got the
matter all wrong,” he sa,fJ-
sounds terrible the way he has ex-
plained it.”
JOKE "ALL WRONG ”
McLeod said that for the last two or
three years that type of. humour had
come into every theatre in England.
“ If you were the dumbest comedian
in the world,” he said, “ you would
eventually have to get mto the trend
of things. I have to go with the tide,
and my gags are mild compared with
some I heard in London/’
The stipendiary, Mr. Stuart Deacon,
found that five of the jokes were in-

Edward William James, the manager
of the theatre, was summoned for per-
mitting the language to be used, but in
view of the steps he took to prevent the
offence and his record of 31 years as a
theatre manager without complaint, he
wls discharged with a caution and
ordered to pay 4s. costs.
LIONS ESCAPE
MAN TORN TO PIECES
COOL ACTION SAVES RESCUER’S
LIFE
PARIS, November 22.
Two lions tore up the floor of their
cage and escaped from a menagerie at
Avignon. One tore a butcher to pieces
in the main street, despite rescue efforts
by a neighbour named Pieolet. The
lion abandoned his prey and sprang at
Pieolet, who threw himself down and
feigned death. The lion sniffed the
body and departed, to the relief ox the
horror-stricken villagers watching from
windows. The second lion attacked a
f armer named Ywanich, tearing his arm.
Ywanich scared it up a tree by flashing
an electric torch in its face. The police
later shot both animals.

FOUR CAGED LIONS
IN UNREHEARSED
TUMBLING FEAT
BELLINGEN (N.S.W.), Mon-
day.—A heavy lorry, drawing an
iron trailer cage containing four
lions, belonging to Perry's Circus,
crashed over an embankment into
the Bellinger River yesterday.
The lorry was almost completely
submerged, only the top of the cab
being visible, but the trailer re-
mained precariously balanced on
the very edge of the river. As
the lorry plunged into the water,
the driver jumped clear.
From Raleith station, where the
rest of the cfrcus had entrained,
two large elephants, one being
Jessie, formerly of Taronga Park,
were sent to the scene. One
elephant was hitched to the lions'
cage, which was then detached from
the lorry, and, exerting all its
prodigious strength, c the elephant
hauled the cage up the precipitous
embankment foot by foot until it
reached the roadway.
ESCAPED LIONS
CAUSE PANIC
IN ESSEX TOWN
The Herald Cable Service
LONDON, Wednesday. f
There was a wild rush for
safety when four lions es-I
caped from a circus at Brain-
tree (Essex). J
One of the animals jumped
over a perambulator in
which a baby was lying. Then
it smashed a window and en-
tered a house where it was
locked in the scullery until
the keepers, firing blank
cartridges, frightened it into
a cage.
Another lion attacked a
pony before it was stunned
by a keeper.
The other beasts were re-
captured after having wan-j
dered through gardens and:
orchards, terrifying the own-
ers of properties.
MAULED BY
TIGER
CIRCUS ATTACK
Mauled by a tiger which
sprang upon him when he
tripped during a rehearsal
at Wirth’s Olympia last
evening, Eric Flyger, animal
trainer, suffered severe in-
juries to his left arm.
FLYGER was kicking and shout-
ing to the animal in an effort
to frighten it off, when Mr.
George Wirth, jun., who had wit-
nessed the attack, rushed into the
huge cage with a long-handled
fork.
Brandishing this, he beat off the tiger
just as a second animal, participating in
the rehearsal, was about to join in the
attack
Imported from India only six months
ago, the tiger was a Royal Bengal, weigh-
ing 4cwt.
“Slipped Off See-saw”
“He is full of life, but has never given
us any trouble before,” Flyger said to-
day. “I was standing in the centre of
a see-saw with a tiger sitting at each end,
when I slipped.
“Immediately Prince, the larger of the
two animals, pounced at me, pushing me
over, and was making a nasty job of
mauling me, when Mr. Wirth rushed in.
“Pasha, the other tiger, leaped from
the plank, and was about to join Prince
when Mr. Wirth beat them both off.
“When a man is lying on the ground
a tiger will always attack, and, believe
me, I had a few uncomfortable moments.”
MYSTERY MAN
OF CIRCUS „
“Boss Tentman Tells
His Story
This is the story of the “mystery
man—the man who never sleeps,” the
mainstay of Wirth’s Circus, with which
he has been associated for 30 years.
His name is Joseph Nugent, and he
is known as the “boss tentman.” He
is an engineer by profession, and he
wears medals won in rowing, blue dun-
garee overalls, and a Stetson hat. He
can swing 141 b hammers in either
hand, and he can carry half a giant
tentpole.
But these are
not part of his
work. His work
is to supe: intend
the working stall
of 50 men, to see
that tents are
erected within two
hours after the
circus reaches a
location, and are
dismantled and
packed, ready for
the roads an hour
and a half after
the show ends at
10.30 p.m.
Mr. J. Nugent.
Strange work for an engineer, may-
be, but his profession stands him in
good stead in measuring circles and
the like, and in making quick calcu-
lations. Apart from all this, how-
ever, it is the glamour of the life that
holds him and men such as he.
Joe Nugent is the pride of Wirth
Brothers. “If you want to discuss
circus life you should speak to Joe
Nugent,” said Mr. Philip Wirth, jun.,
yesterday, as he looked on at the driv-
ing of pegs, the laying of sawdust.”
“A GREAT LIFE.”
“It is a great life,” said Joe Nugent,
“a life that I would not change for
any other. I superintend the work.
I see that the jobs are done thoroughly
and on time. And I see that every-
body gets proper rest and regular
meals. We are a self-contained com-
munity. We live in trains. We do
our own cooking.
“Take an average day in the life of
the circus. We arrive in a town early
in the morning. After breakfast we
begin at 9 o’clock to erect the tents.
In two hours the task is completed, and
he grooms have attended to the live-
stock. Then there is luncheon and
rest for a few hours. The men wake
up refreshed for their tea, have an
hour’s leisure and attend a roll-call
at 6.30.
“Bv 7 o’clock every man is in his
place ready for the evening perform-
ance. The show is over by 10.30, and
by midnight the tents are dismantled,
and the whole show is on the move to
the next town. Men and women go
to sleep in their vans and are awak-
ened at some town miles farther on
next morning. It is only when we
strike the larger cities that they
awaken for a few mornings to the
sights they saw when they went to
bed.”
WAYS OF ARTISTS.
“Artists ?nd their wavs? r ±hev vary
a good deal. The Americans are, as
a rule, the most difficult. They are
very assertive, want their own way in
and talk a great deal. The
Continental artists Mr. Wirth engages
every year are always men and
women with world-wide reputations,
and thev know their value to the
show. Often they are temperamental,
but they stead, aown after a while-
“ The personality of Mr. Philip Wirth,
sen., is a grevt influence—so great
that many of these artists stay on in
Australia al'te- their contracts are
completed. Others who go to the
Continent return to Australia time
aftei time.
“The' ‘draw cards'? Well, I should
place the flying trapeze act first. It
always ha,* been a great attraction.
But the elephants, too, cannot be
underestimated. The spangled ladies.'
the ponies, the menagerie—all these
have their appeal, ’but I think the
trapeze act is sunreme.”


NEVER MURMURS— Jessie hates to have her face washed by Mr. F. Lyons every morning.
But, like all good little girls, she never murmurs, even though the bristles of the scrubbing
brush do hurt!
BEHIND THE EARS.— Jessie purrs with delight when she is scrubbed behind the ears. The
parting on the top is getting rather thin; but some day Jessie means to have her hair shingled.
THURSDAY, MAY 22, 1924
USES A METAL FILE. —She is particular about her nails.
Mr. C. Camp, the gentleman with the file, considers it an honor
to manicure her.
SUFFERS FROM CORNS.— The poor girl has to stand all
day on her feet. She suffers from corns, but she is very brave
about them. How would you like to have a corn like that?
IMPROVES HER SMILE. —Every morning she has her teeth scrubbed, because she knows it
improves her gentle smile.
A SECRET GRIEF. —You would never think, when riding on Jessie’s back, that she has a secret
grief. Perhaps it’s her complexion. Kindly Mr. Camp wipes away that furtive tear.

Trapeze Artists in
Thrilling Tricks.
ESTERDAY , a woman and two
i •*- men Were photographed for the
| IVomen s Supplement flying through the
air sixty feet above the ground. They
passed from one trapeze to another per-
forming leaps and tumbles in mid-air at
a speed of sixty miles an hour. One s
heart leaped with the thrill of their move-
ments and sometimes with the fear that
one hand might not meet another.
The artists Were the Flying De Vards
Mitzi, Eldred, and Billy—who have come to
Australia from America under contract to
Wirth's Circus.
Here is Work indeed for the steady eye,
the body in perfect condition, and the mind
calm with confidence. Only their flashing speed,
synchronised with split-second timing for every
evolution, saved them from crashing to the
net far below. Behind this graceful and thrill-
ling Work are years of patient practice and
endeavour on the part of the artists. But
Miss Mitzi De Yard has Written her story
for the Women s Supplement —•
BY MISS MITZI DE YARD.
“I WAS born in Atlanta City, Georgia, the scene
I of Margaret Mitchell’s book, ‘Gone With the
Wind.’ I did my first trapeze act when I was six
years old. The previous year my four brothers and
four sisters had formed a circus troupe under the
direction of my parents. As ‘Moore’s Family
Circus’ we travelled about the States for years.
Like many children who have to share the house-
work from an early age, I had to l?am all I
could of the show business, and in those early
years did my best to equip myself as a circus
Jaek-of-all-trades. In that family show we did
clowning, stunt-skating, bare-back riding, and
trapeze acts, so there was much to learn.
“Nineteen-twenty-one brought me my first big
offer. I was engaged as a trapeze artist in the
John Robinson Circus, one of the great shows of
the day. Here I had a varied and rather excit-
ing life. In addition to the trapeze work I had
to manage a group of performing horses, and later
put in a year on a wild animal act. Captain
Pete Turner, who became famous as an animal
trainer, was under contract to Robinson’s, and one
day he offered me the control of a big animal act.
I thought it might be a break and took the work
over. This was a mixed animal act, and I had to
boss two lions, three hyenas, three bears, and a
puma in one big cage and put them through their
tricks. I was eighteen then. I used to control
the animals with kindness as far as possible, but
as a reserve one had to be able to strike fear into
them at times. The animals attacked me on seve-
ral occasions and gave me minor scars. The
bears were the most ferocious, and on two occa-
sions savaged my legs. I have the scars to this
day, but consider I was let off rather lightly. I
did not really care for this work and hankered
to go further ahead in ‘flying.’
"AS even one daily act is very strenuous train-
F\ ing, we do not rehearse during a season, and
so have some time for domesticity. We do all
our own household work, and enjoy it. For
pleasure we like to swim or walk or do something
athletic. Billy and my husband and myself all
love walking. We discard taxis when possible
and get endless fun out of hikes of exploration
Ithrough some of the places we travel to. We will
have more free time on this tour, and as we think
Sydney a marvellous place we are looking forward
to discovering it further.
“As for diet—l must deny all those fantastic
stories of strange diets for flying-trapeze artists.
I take care to live simply, but like good, food, as
does my husband and Billy, and all three of us
eat what we like three times a day.
“Do I ever feel nervous? No —and that is where
my husband comes in. You will notice if you see
us working that we talk to one another during
the tricks. This is not usually done, but is con-
sidered attractive in our act. Actually, it is the
means by which my husband, as ‘catcher,’ tells
us the exact moments for flight. It has been
estimated that when the act is in full swing
some of the tricks send us through the air at 60

Let’s All Go to The
Circus Again
UMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
ICOLIN
iWILLS
THAT’S THE CIRCUS ... something that belongs to childhood and to
all of us. Trained animals, trained humans ... pantomime ... ballyhoo
... magic.
TF you ever really
A want to know
whether you’ve
grown old, go to the
circus.
, For the circus does not
change. It is immortal.
If it doesn’t seem the
same, it is you that have
changed.
> If the clowns are not the
funniest fellows on earth,
if the lions do not waken fear
in your heart, if the ladies in
tights are not adorable and
the flying trapeze act doesn’t
take your breath away, you
have grown old, my friend.
But it won’t be so. I knBw it won’t
be so. There is youth in all of us,
only sometimes it is a trifle crushed.
The circus will bring it to life again.
Did I say the circus had not
changed? Why, it has changed com-
pletely. Every act is new. Every
act has never before been seen in
Never before were such
’ >reathless balancers, such slick trick
1 iders on bicycle or bareback, such
1 nighty strong men, such intelligent
animals, such death-defying tra-
pezists.
And yet this has always been so.
The circus, like the spring, renews
itself every, year, and yet is forever
the same.
The lion, my friends, is the king of
beasts —yet man is his master. It is
all done with kindness. These fero-
cious man-eaters, direct from Afri-
can jungles, have learned that man
is their friend. They trust him.
And yet—did you see that one
make a vicious swipe with his paw?
Did you hear that one growl? In
the base hearts of the audience there
is always a sneaking suspicion that
the lions would like to have a piece
of lion-tamer, if they only dared.
Sometimes they break loose. Will it
be tonight?
Consider The Clown
But it isn’t tonight. It never is.
And, of course, everyone is really
very glad. That other feeling was
just the Nero in us all.
Look at those clowns! Look, Bobby;
see the funny man playing the trum-
pet. Yes, that’s Joey. Look! See,
the other man is sneaking up to
frighten him with a big spider.
Joey, the clown, plays a saxophone.
The other clown sneaks up on him
with a giant spider. The audience
is all in the joke. Aha! Such howls
of terror —such pantomime of rage!
Joey stands on a chair to play. But
his tormentor has a chair, too. But
the chair has no bottom! He falls
through, tumbles to and fro . . .
helpless. The audience rocks!
Ladies and gentlemen—the Six
Australian Brumbies! Wild horses
from the Never Never! Yet they
Obey the word of command! In
single file! In twos! In fours! Each
in turn canters prettily round the
ring. One walks. Well, isn’t that
cunning? One turns his back. Did
you ever!
But, 100k —acrobats in green
tights!
One balances a pole on his fore-
head—a chromium pole. Another
climbs up it and balances in midair.
What’s this? Jumping greyhounds.
Look at them! Par over a man’s
head. And look at this! Pigs!
Trained pigs. Well, of all things!
But now another team of acro-
bats. A man hangs by his feet.
From his teeth hangs a girl. From
her teeth hangs another man,
twisting his body like a Catherine
wheel by the muscles of one arm.
Japanese balancers. One spins a
sunshade on his toes . . . another
climbs a ladder held up by a man’s
feet. Another walks straight up a
rope to the roof, slides down like
lightning.
Lady cyclists play basketball . . .
pigmy elephants parade and perform
. . . here's a hurdle race by ponies,
with monkey jockeys.
Everything is more incredible than
the last. Green tights, blue tights,
tights in Oriental embroidery . . .
strong men in dressing-gowns ar-
ranging the apparatus for the next
act while attendants in scarlet coats
carry out the debris of the last .
and always the clowns . . doing
conjuring tricks, shooting candles off
each other’s changing hats,
tumbling, slapsticking.
And now they spread the net . . .
the device of safety that announces
danger.
It’s the climax of the show—the
high trapeze act. Up to the roof
they climb, three figures in pink
tights—a big man with red hair, a
girl, and a daring young man.
High up swing the little trapezes.
Swing, swing! Suddenly the small
man takes off, let’s go his bar, somer-
saults ... by no more than an inch
his hands catch those of his com-
rade. They swing together ... he
is gone . . . back to his own bar.
Now the girl, launching herself
through the air, gracefully, as
though she were diving. She’s passed
him! But he catches her ankles
... it was all part of the trick.
i
It is as it always has been . . .
even the ringmaster with his im-
maculate dress suit, his cracking
whip . . . and yet—there’s just one
thing I wish they would do to make
it perfect.
Why doesn’t the ringmaster wear
his top-hat any more?
Please!

THE TOWER BALLROOM PAVILION.
“The most handsome and artistic ballroom in the world” was the description of a famous expert, when talking of the Tower, and the magnificence of the
stately chamber well deserves the proud encomium. The design of the Pavilion is magnificent. The parquet floor is remarkable for its beauty and resiliency.
Dancing takes place afternoon and evening to one of the largest and most descriptive Dance Orchestras in the Kingdom, aided by symphony from the new
mighty Wurlitzer Grand Organ. Children’s Ballets are a feature of the programme.

JUST ARRIVED BY AIRMAIL, this picture shows Captain Campbell

Unusual Circus Tricks Follow Young Men’s Dinner
Lions’ Cages Used
As Carriages
pOURTEEN young men who are well
known in Melbourne, dressed in
dinner suits, walked out of a hotel in
the city last night and entered two
chariots. The chariots were lions’ cages
from a circus, and with some seated
on chairs and with others on the roofs
the procession created a stir among
homeward-bound shoppers.
At Wirth’s Park an elephant was
hitched to the cages, and the train
entered the circus ring with a man
dressed as an Indian seated on the
elephant’s neck.
It was the aftermath of a farewell
dinner given to Mr. Dick Allen on the
eve of his departure for New Guinea.
Organ Recital At Caulfield

Road, Caulfield, tomorrow, Mr. Harold
A. Rooksby will give an organ recital

tralto.
AFTER A FAREWELL DINNER to Mr. R. Allen, the airman, at the
Hotel Australia last night, a party of 14 men, who entertained him, were
towed through the city to Wirth’s Park, where an elephant took charge
of the unusual procession and towed them into the circus ring.

i DINNER WITH LIONS.
UNIQUE JUBILEE MEAL
Wirths' 60th Anniversary
Celebrated.
Ninety-eight citizens of Melbourne sat
down to dinner with two lions last night.
The lions, to be strictly accurate, merely
sat down. They had already been fed.
In this fashion, with stuffed lions and
tigers on every table, watchful atten-
dants in uniform hovering by, with
powerful lights illuminating the scene,
Wirth Bros.' circus celebrated the 60tn
anniversary of jts founding. A steel
cage 45 feet in diameter encircled both
lions and diners, who sat on the floor
of Wirth’s Olympia. The guests in-
cluded Parliamentarians and leading
civic figures. Both the king and the
queen of beasts, for there was a lioness,
had been trained for this function for
the past two weeks. Prince was a bit
languid. He yawned widely. Elsie, the
honess, was bored. She behaved oadiy
and turned her back on the guests. The
situation was one pregnant with possi-
bilities. Suppose the lion suddenly let
out one of those earth-shaking roars.
What would be etiquette for a stout
near ted but cautious guest in that case ?
Suppose Elsie started some African
rough stuff. Would a hurried retreat
be in order ?
A terse recall to good manners from
*,Le trainer. Captain E. Flyger, restrained
any homicidal impulses the lion might
have had as he watched the diners, and
he moodily turned in the other direc-
tion to meet the undaunted gaze of the
Fire Brigade chief and a couple of lead-
ing police force officers. That efficiently
quelled him. It was a thrill to walk
into the cage with the lions, but what a
moment when the lions walked out of
it ! Strangely enough the conversation,
which hitherto had been subdued, now
became a loud and genial buzz.
’ Mr. White, M.P., who made a short
speech, said he expected he had been
chosen to speak because he was a mem-
ber of the Lyons Government.
Mr. P. Wirth, jun., on behalf of his
father, made a short speech, and a
number of toasts were drunk. After the
lions were taken away several stuffed
animals were sold for charity, and the
guests, caught on the rebound, sub-
scribed £9O for the Masonic Hospital.
A short-wave broadcast of the event
was sent out with the hope of telling
England, and a description was given
tnrough 3AW and other local stations.
Mr J. D. Porter was responsible for the
conception and presentation of the
dinner.
The man balancing on his hands
on a spot where most people would
be frightened to stand on their feet
is Balmus who does this sort of
thing for amusement. He is on
top of the Gap. 11 0 feet above the
rocks, where the suicides fall, and
took up the position to allow the
moving picture camera to supply
people with thrills by proxy.

BLIND CHILDREN AT THE CIRCUS.

It is the popular beliet that circus animals billed "wild” are as tame as pet canaries Whether these

Long Tack Sam anti his troupe of Chinese Wonder Workers are at present

similar attraction created widespread interest in this country last year, since
which time Long Tack Sam himself has scoured portions of China with a
view to securing the best available talent for a somewhat similar presentation.
Except for the principal, his wife and two daughters, the combination is an
entirely new one. Several old feats and many that are new and intricate form
the present offering of this famous troupe.

WHAT THE EYES SEE THE MIND MUST BELIEVE.
Not a fraudulent Imitation, but a genuine curiosity. One of old Mother Nature’s remarkable eccen
trlcities. Brother and sister in the one anatomy—the nearest approach to the complete upion of the two
sexes. Not a male impersonator nor a woman with a small figure, strapping down one side of chest to
give the appearance of a man, nor one side of the face stuffed with cotton to make it different from the
other side. Not a "stick”, but a person who gives an intelligent lecture, using female voice in con-
junction with the masculine side of the body.

The laughable antics of the clowns never fail to keep circus audiences
in a jolly mood.
“T AY-DEES and gen-tel-men! The
next act is the first of its kind
ever to be presented in Australasia!
As the artist literally takes her life in
her hands during the performance of
this death de-fying act, will you—ladies
and gentlemen—be as quiet as pos-
sible? Even the slightest noise ....
Thank you!”
Who has not, at some time of his or
her life, thrilled to intimations such
as this, shouted lustily over the circus
arena to the dense-packed, tiered-up
crowd beyond? Who has not felt the
odd tautness of expectancy as, the
music stilled, the people silent to the
announcer’s wish, the artist moves for-
ward under the spotlight, gay dress
a-glitter, to perform some special feat
of agility and nerve? And who has not,
the act over and the suspense lifted,
turned in happy relief to welcome the
homely foolings of the clowns? The
circus is kind like that. It gives one
spectacle and excitement, humour, ac-
tion, and strange sights, but in gentle
alternations, so that one is spared the
concentrated emotional grip of so many
modern entertainments. To witness a
circus performance is not to sit in one’s
seat under bombardment, as it were,
from the stage, but rather to settle back
in amiable content, prepared to allow
the programme to develop on any old
lines and enjoy it just the same!

The difference, perhaps, lies in the
old-fashioned atmosphere of the
circus. The circus is old-fashioned in
that it retains its characteristics from
year to year, yet it does not grow old.
It is the Fanny Ward of amusements.
And while its appeal to children is ir-
resistible, it is strong, too, for all who
are young at heart and have not en-
tirely suppressed instinctive delight in
unsophisticated things.
IYTELBOURNE and Sydney have at
least an annual opportunity of
seeing a circus—Wirth’s well-known
“greatest show on earth,” which timed
its arrival this year to coincide with
the Centenary celebrations. Fifty-two
other towns and settlements in Aus-
tralia and Tasmania are visited once
in two years by this company, while
New Zealand also comes into the itiner-
ary. At one time this circus travelled
to England, South Africa, Mauritius,
India, Burma, the Federated Malay
States, and South America, but now
quarantine restrictions prevent a trek
so far afield. However, a curtailment
in this direction has not meant a cur-
tailment in the enterprise of this old-
established firm, which continues to
bring the most up-to-date arenic fea-
tures to Australasia. Mr. Philip Wirth
has had 53 years of the sawdust ring,
and his wife and family of two sons
and five daughters both assist him in
some way with the management and
presentation of his circus.
Miss Madeline Wirth, speaking
of the part played in the circus
by her and her sisters, said that
they had all had college educa-
tions and it was not intended that
any of them should join up with the
show. However, Miss Eileen Wirth
(Mrs. A. Clark) was so interested in
an elephant act which she saw in
America that she decided to do
something similar herself in her par-
ents’ circus, and that, as Miss Made-
line said, “started the ball rolling.”
Mrs. Clark has now retired, but one
by one, with the exception of the
youngest, Miss Marizeles, who is still
at school, the sisters have “fallen”
for the life of the circus. Miss Doris
Wirth looks after the “front” —in
other words, she handles the book-
ing, office* work, etc. —as well as
joining with the others in such pre-
sentations as a thrilling aerial neck-
hanging act. Miss Gladys presents
six Australian brumbies in military
drill, and Miss Madeline is busy
adding a pad act to her repertoire.
Each sister practises for an hour and
a half each day, for new acts are

continually being worked out, and
naturally, rehearsing is necessary for
these as well as for the turns already
on the programme.
TN connection with training the
T animals Miss Madeline told an
amusing tale of a small fox terrier
dog who attached himself to the
circus, following it from place to
place. His attendance was not en-
couraged, but he refused to leave,
and finally Mr. Philip Wirth, Junr.,
asked “Funny Danny,” who already
had a small troupe of performing
dogs, if he could do something with
the poor unwanted. The newcomer
turned out the “best of the bunch.”
It was no trouble to him to learn
tricks, and in less than no time he
was “bossing” all the other terriers
and generally taking the lead
throughout the act. In fact, so
anxious is he to “do his stuff” that
difficulties are apt to occur through
his going on from one trick to
another in glorious succession with-
out waiting for orders!
Doing a toe dance in a cage with
eleven lions and bears is not every-
one’s idea of enjoying the terpsi-
chorean art, but this was one of Miss
Madeline’s usual contributions to the
circus programme. On one occasion
she had a very nasty experience.
“Bears,” she said, “‘are the meanest
of animals. They never make a

Needless to say, Miss Madeline
admits to having no fear of animals!
ONE of the most famous acts in
Wirth’s Circus is the statue act,
in which horse and rider, portraying
some special incident, remain in per-
fect immobility for the duration of
the scene. Curiously enough, it is,
according to Miss Madeline, always
the most nervy of horses which
proves “trainable” for a turn of this
type. A horse which may be far too
badly behaved to be of any use in
the circus ring will carry out this
item without difficulty.

tesy of Wirth's
Circus.
(VTUCH has been written of the
glamour of the circus, but there
is a strictly practical side to this
mode of entertainment, just as there
is to any theatrical enterprise. Over
£3 6,000 is paid annually in salaries
by Wirth’s Circus, while the trans-
portation and feeding of the circus
and menagerie animals entail very
heavy expenses as well as clever
organisation. Two special trains
over half a mile in length, the floors
of the elephant trucks heavily rein-
forced, are necessary to convey the
circus from one place to another.
The bears eat 100 loaves of brown
and white bread every day, as well
as fish, or juicy steaks, and cod liver
oil. One and a half tons of oaten
hay is the weekly portion of the
eight elephants, and a hundred-
weight of raw beef must be found
daily for the lions and the tigers.

Graveyard Humor
Unusual Verses on Tombstones
In New England Cemeteries
Early New England settlers had a well-developed sense of humor.
They also were deeply religious and looked forward to life after
death. Thus, death was not such a fearful matter that the pioneers
could not sometimes jest about it, as these old tombstones from
New England clearly show. Some of them date back to before the
Revolutionary War. Others are later, including one dated 1846.

The Mal Love of
ALFREDO CODONA
By Mrs. ANNIE BRUCE
The Mother of the Wife He Killed
(Reading time : 31 minutes 58 seconds.)
WHEREVER a circus tent is raised, in every
corner of the world, there is known the story of
Alfredo Codona, the greatest of aerialists, and
his beautiful wife and partner, Vera.
It is a story told with tears in the eyes, for it is a tragic
story. Yet it is a story of pity, too, and tenderness, and
the terrible driving force of a passionate love that could
not be restrained by reason.
Handsome, romantic Alfredo Codona, whose feats in j
the air were such miracles of grace, of daring, of skill; |
whose name was included among those of the circus im- j
mortals even in his lifetime—what a tragedy he brought |
about through his inability to win the love he so hungered
for!
Yes, they speak of what happened to Alfredo and Vera
Codona with tears in their eyes, and with hearts wrung by
sorrow. But who can measure the grief that T have
suffered? For I was the mother of the beautiful Vera
Codona, and I was a witness to a tragedy so terrible that
only writers of horror fiction can conceive its like.
To-day I weep and weep, and my nights are endless
horrors. But what is there to do ? What can one do when
faced with the devastating results of uncontrolled '
emotion ?
I can only find some solace in relating this terrible but
pathetic story of Alfredo and Vera Codona and hope that
every one who reads it will realise what disaster there lies
in the attempt to force love from one who cannot give it.
Both Alfredo and Vera came of circus stock. My
husband was bandmaster in a circus that toured the
Orient, and I was a trapeze artist in the same circus when
we married, having run away from my home in Australia
to join it.
Vera and my son, Clary, were born practically under
canvas. Before Vera came, I worked to within six weeks
of my confinement, and for a year after her birth she
travelled with us, sleeping in a makeshift cot in our
dressing tent. Later I took her back to Australia for an
education, but when she was sixteen she joined her father
and brother in the circus and took to bareback riding as
naturally as other girls take to some light sport. She was
a very pretty girl, with a fine figure and a courageous
spirit, and soon became a featured performer.
Alfredo’s father and mother were both aerialists, and
his father and his grandfather were also of the circus.
They were Mexicans and marvellous artists.
ALFREDO was the greatest of them all, probably the
most famous trapeze performer that the world has :
known. His work was so extraordinary that he became
almost a legend in the circus. He was as outstanding foi
the grace with which he performed his feats as for the l
difficulty of the feats themselves. He was like a bird in
the air, and his body was fit for a sculptor to model. His ,
greatest achievement was the triple somersault, in which
he turned three times in the air before reaching the
catcher. He was the first aerialist to do this sensational
act, and no one who learned it after him did it with the
same picturesque finesse. There never was a performer
like Alfredo Codona, and circus people are convinced that j
there never will be another like him.
My husband died about two years after Vera joined the
circus, and then she and Clary went to America, where |
they appeared with circuses and in vaudeville.
About eleven vears ago Vera, Alfredo, his first wife,
Clara, and Lillian Leitzel. the trapeze artist, were all with
Ringling Brothers. Vera was a member of the May
Wirth riding act, and doing odd bits, like riding in spec-
the opening parade spectacle—and posing with the living-
statues group.
Leitzel was the most famous of the women trapeze per-
formers. She was a very attractive and cultured woman,
earning a high salary, and popular in society. She had
been married and divorced, and was now admired » one
of the circus executives.
After Leitzel and Alfredo had been in the same circus
for a little time. Leitzel became infatuated with Codona.
It was no secret among the performers that Alt redo had
put himself out to cause this infatuation. He had heard
that the executive was fond of her and decided in his
impulsive, grandiose Latin way. that it would be good
sport to take Leitzel away from him.
That Alfredo was married did not trouble him e
and Clara were not too happy together, and quarrels be-
tween them were often heard by us. suppose ey
remained married only because she was in is ac ns
brother, Lalo, being the other member—and it would have
been difficult to train another girl to take her place
Soon Leitzel’s infatuation changed to love. Although
she - was highly temperamental and
imperious in the ring, she was glad
to wait on Alfredo, and served him
in every way she could. She even
prepared meals for him, and had her
maid look after his clothes.
ALFREDO was dazzled by this
attention. True, he, too, was a
celebi ity, but when he left the ring
he was a performer like the rest,
while Leitzel had a life outside the
circus. She was received every-
where, and her name was known
A°ir 3 , , much & reater public than
Alfredo s.
He had begun this affair as an
escapade, and that it should have
turned out so seriously for Leitzel
battered his vanity immensely. He
began to think of marrying her.
As for Clara, Alfredo had no
scruples. She could secure a divorce,
e would find means of convincing'
her that divorce was best for both of them.
Alfredo had a dominant personality. What he wanted
he was accustomed to get. Clara should not stand in his
wav. Soon the divorce action was started, and in due
time the Codonas were parted. In the divorce settlement
_ it had been agreed that Clara was to receive two hundred
pounds in cash and retain her place in the circus.
As soon as he was free. Alfredo married Leitzel.
Clara got the two hundred pounds. But when it came
to keeping her in the act. Leitzel objected. She could not
bear to have the ex-wife around constantly, and in inti-
mate association with her husband. She urged Alfredo to
get rid of Clara and get some one else in her place.
Alfredo protested, not from consideration for Clara,
but because he was unwilling to go through with the work
of training a new girl.
Then Leitzel thought of Vera. She had first met my
daughter when they were on the same bill at the New
York Hippodrome, and now that they were together again,
Leitzel had become very friendly with Vera.
“Why don’t you put Vera in?” Leitzel suggested.
“ She’s a promising girl.”
Alfredo was anxious to please his bride, so he went
to Vera’s dressing-room right away, and interviewed
her.
He and Vera had, of course, seen each other,
but had never spoken more than a few casual
words. Codona was the big star and, since
he had married Leitzel, was considered
a bigger star than ever. All the
newspapers were writing about the
pair, and the Codona reputation
was reaching new classes of
people. Vera was still a
little-known bareback
rider.
After talking to
her, and apprais-
al. ing her phv-
sique, Alfredo concluded that Leitzel was right. Vera
would make a good partner for him.
“ Clara is leaving the act.” he said. “ Would you like
to join me ? ” .
For Vera, this was an unusual opportunity, She was
always scrupulously honest, and possessed an innate fair-
ness'that made her the trusted friend of all who knew
her. If she had been aware of the true circumstances of
I Clara’s leaving, she would not have considered Alfredo s
offer. As it was, she was only too happy to accept the
opportunity. . . cu
The next day Alfredo began training Vera. She
learned quickly, and before Clara realised what was going
on, Vera was ready for the act and Clara had been pu
out, discarded as ruthlessly as she had been discarded as
Alfredo’s wife. . , . ,
Alfredo Codona was then, moving in a world of wnicn
1 he was the centre, and he could be callously indifferent to
1 the feelings of others. He was gay, romantic, a good
I companion; but it was always of himself that he first
! The season in America had ended, and the Codona
brothers and Leitzel were booked for a European tour,
the tour beginning in Paris. .
It was in Paris that Vera made her debut with Alfredo.
The “ passing leap ” was featured by him, and this was
• a dangerous act for a new performer. Vera had to fly
from Lalo’s hands, turn a somersault in the air, and catch
! the bar just vacated by Alfredo, who turned a somersault
; over Vera’s body and caught Lalo’s hands. The act went
through smoothly and Vera received enthusiastic applause.
From then on, my daughter was established as a per-
manent member of the Flying Codonas, and in the next
J three years travelled all over America and Europe with
Alfredo and Leitzel.
Alfredo’s marriage was what might have been expecte .
Two such temperaments as his and Leitzel s had to clash,
and sometimes Leitzel’s temper got the better of her, and
objects flew from her hands to Alfredo s head.
«•<»
Many of these squabbles were over
women, but they were not very
serious, and after Leitzel calmed
down, their life went on in that semi-
satisfactory manner so often found
among artists of their type.
NATURALLY, Leitzel could not
sustain her original love—or
what she thought was love—for
Alfredo. It would have been diffi-
cult for any performer so famous
and highly strung as she to preserve
love. But she was strongly attached
to Alfredo, and jealous of him.
To Vera, Alfredo was sometimes
very friendly and sometimes very
casual. Lie, Leitzel and Vera usually
dined together when thev were away
from the circus cook-tent, and often
went to cabarets and other places of
amusement. Leitzel was fond of
Vera, and Alfredo showed that he,
too, was interested in her, but no
more than that.
At the end of these three years of
work together, the Codonas and
Leitzel were in Europe. Alfredo
was booked for the Berlin Winter
Garden, but Leitzel had an engage-
ment at the Valencia Musica Hall, in
Copenhagen.
Leitzel was to be away for a fort-
night. No sooner had she left him.
lan (Continued on bn no 81 \
Alfredo became a changed man. The
first night he went into Vera’s dressing-
room.
“ After the show,” he said, “ we will
go out. I know a lovely place for
supper.”
Vera was startled by his tone. There
was an expression on his face she had
never seen before.
“ No, I don’t think I’ll go out to-
night,” she replied, trying to take his
invitation casually.
“ Oh, but you must,” he insisted.
“We can have a fine time together. I
want you to go out with me.”
“ Some other time,” Vera said, still
trying to be casual. “ I am tired
to-night.”
Alfredo put his fingers lightly on her
bare shoulder. “ You are very beautiful,
Vera.”
Then his voice changed. “ This is a
dangerous town for beautiful women. I
want to teach you how to protect your-
self.”
He took out a small pistol. “ Here,
take this and keep it under your pillow.”
Vera shrank from the weapon.
“ I don’t need it, Alfredo. I wouldn’t
know what to do with it. Take it
away.”
Alfredo laughed.
“ A charming, naive girl! Never
mind, I’ll see that you are protected.
No man shall touch you while I am
with you.”
The transition in Alfredo was amaz-
ing to Vera. She made light of his
remarks that night, and hoped she would
not hear them again. But the next day
he again insisted on her going out with
him, and this time tried to embrace her.
Vera resisted him, still trying to avoid
taking his advances seriously.
But the more Vera resisted, the more
impetuous and insistent Alfredo became.
He seemed to be much astonished that
any woman he admired could refuse his
advances. Women had been more than
kind to Alfredo. He had never lacked
partners for affairs. His magnificent
body, his charming manners, his extra-
ordinary grace, and his great fame made
him irresistible.
THAT night, after the show, Alfredo
again appeared in Vera’s dressing-
room.
“ Now, Vera,” he said, “ you know
you are going' to belong to me, so why
make all this fuss? Why can’t we have
a good time together ? ”
“ Because that’s not my way of
living,” Vera told him. “ Besides,"your
wife is my friend.”
“ Well, why should that make a
difference? You can still be her friend.”
“ No, Alfredo, I’m not like that.
There are others. You don’t have to
bother with me.”
He laughed. “Of course there are
others. But it’s you I want. I’ve
wanted you for a long time, and now
we have an opportunity.”
He tried to take her in his arms. She
fought him off. *
“ I’m not that kind of a ! ” she
cried over and over again. “ Let’s just
be friends. Don’t hurt me, nor Leitzel.”
“ Again Leitzel ”he burst out
savagely. Then he recovered himself.
“ You’re a funny girl! ” He looked at
her with amusement. “So pretty, and
so cold! ”
He left her. But Vera knew Alfredo
would not give up. Leitzel would be
gone for a fortnight.
But the next morning a startling
telegram came from Copenhagen for
Alfredo.
“ Your wife is badly hurt,” it read.
" Come at once.”


Alfredo and Leitzel’s mother, who had
remained in Berlin, immediately took a
’plane for Copenhagen. There they dis-
covered a dreadful accident had
occurred. Leitzel had been doing her
famous one-arm round ; that is, turning
her body around rapidly while holding
on with one hand to the end of a rope
fifty feet in the air. She always made
a hundred turns, sometimes many more.
As she was twirling around, something
broke and Leitzel crashed to the stage.
Attendants ran to her and were about
to carry her off, but she pushed them
away and tried to walk, unable to
believe that the great Leitzel could be
seriously injured in a fall.
But she collapsed. Doctors were
called. They pronounced her badly
hurt, and had her taken at once to the
hospital.
When Alfredo arrived, however,
Leitzel had already improved so much
that the doctors told him he could return
to Berlin for that evening’s perform-
ance. There were only a few minutes
in which to catch a train which would
bring him into Berlin in time for the
show, so Alfredo left Leitzel’s mother
in Copenhagen, and hurried back.
Just as he stepped off the train in the
Berlin station a messenger handed him
a telegram : “ Leitzel dead. Come back.”
That was the end of the great and.,
beautiful Lillian Leitzel. And for all
her greatness she died alone, without
one friend or relative at her bedside.
As Leitzel suddenly grew worse, her
mother became hysterical and had to be
taken away to her hotel room. There
was no one else in Copenhagen close
enough to the broken artist to watch
over her in her dying moments.
How the accident happened, no one
knew. There was a scientific explana-
tion of a fault in one of the steel parts
of the rigging, but all circus people were
puzzled. Every trapeze artist and
aerialist carries his own rigging, and it
is carefully inspected before each per-
formance.
BUT what did it matter how the acci-
dent happened? The world was
moved only by Leitzel’s death. It was
a shock for the millions who had seen
and admired her. I don’t believe the
death of any performer, with the pos-
sible exceptions of Caruso and Rudolph
Valentino, ever caused such sorrow
among the public as the death of Lillian
Leitzel.
Vera was stunned. She knew that, at
the moment Leitzel had crashed to the
stage of the Valencia, Alfredo was
either making love to her, or planning
to win her. This realisation tortured
her.
Then Lalo, Alfredo’s brother, came to
her with a big box.
“ Here are three gowns,” he said.
“ Leitzel bought them for your birthday.
She said to me, ‘ I won’t be here, so you
give them to Vera.’ ”
Vera’s birthday was on the 19th of
that month, several days later.
Leitzel’s thoughtfulness made her
death the more shocking to Vera, par-
ticularly since by a weird coincidence
Leitzel’s body was cremated on Vera’s
birthday.
Alfredo and Vera left Berlin, carrying
Leitzel’s ashes with them. A subtle
change had come over Alfredo. Not-
withstanding Leitzel’s death, his attitude
towards Vera was as ardent as before.
But he was no longer merely the
w'oman-hunter. When lie spoke to her,
when he looked at her, there was a new
tenderness in his voice and in his eyes,
a new gentleness in his manner.
But Vera was so stricken by what had
happened that she did not notice this
change. She could think only of the
poor, crushed Leitzel.
As the ship with Alfredo and Y era
aboard sailed into New Y ork Harbour
an aeroplane flew 7 over it, and dropped
wreaths for Leitzel. 1 his tribute had
been arranged by some of Leitzel s
admirers. Similar tributes continued
along the journey to California, where
Alfredo lived, and where, in Inglewood
Cemetery, he interred Leitzel’s ashes.
To-day there is an imposing statue of
marble over her grave, imported from
Italy at a cost of tw 7 o thousand pounds,
and all about it are markers placed by
those who had known and loved Lillian
Leitzel.
Alfredo and \ era went back to work,
and directly after the interment of Leit-
zel’s ashes, opened with Ringling
Brothers circus at Madison Square
Garden, New' York.
Circus performers cannot permit any-
thing to interfere w r ith their acts.
Alfredo was the same wonderful aerialist
he always had been, and Vera w r as an
expert partner. Under Alfredo’s train-
ing and guidance, she was acquiring a
reputation as one of the leading artists
in her profession.
At the same time Alfredo never left
her free from his attentions. He no
longer forced himself on her, and he did
not always demand that she yield to him.
He pleaded.
“ There is no longer Leitzel to con-
sider,” he used to say.
Vera could only repeat, “ That’s not
my way of living.”
Alfredo could not understand her. He
could not understand how any woman
could resist such passionate courtship
from the celebrated Alfredo Codona.
“ That’s not my way of living! ”
What kind of reply was that? Was
she a little schoolgirl ? Or did she
stupidlv want to seclude herself from
life?
It was amazing.
“ Vera,” he would say, “ I can go out
and get any woman I want. And I
can’t get you. Why is that ? ”
Vera was in despair. “It’s just
because I don’t like that kind of life.
That’s all I can tell you. Can’t you
understand ? ”
Alfredo couldn’t understand.
Vera often wanted to leave the
“ Flying Codonas,” but when Alfredo
suspected she was thinking of leaving,
he became contrite and begged her to
forgive him. And when he was contrite
and repentant, Alfredo was a very sym-
pathetic person. He had most charming
and ingratiating qualities.
So Vera stayed on. A year passed,
two years. During this time the change
that had begun in Alfredo after Leitzel
died increased. As Vera consistently
found it impossible to accede to Al-
fredo’s wishes, he did begin to under-
stand her reasons, and did begin to have
an insight into her character. And with
this understanding his interest in her
was transformed to love.
All his life Alfredo had skimmed on
the surface of emotion, and lived in a
world of glitter. Now, for the first time,
he felt genuine love, and into this love
went all the intensity that was in the
man.
TO him Vera now became an ideal, a
shrine at w'hich he knelt day and
night. She became to him the purity,
the nobility, the grace, the beauty, the
fascination that was in woman.
“ I have never loved any one but you,”
he told her. “No one can ever love you
as I love you. No one ever will.”
In one of the letters I received from
Vera at this time, she wrote, “ Mother,
Alfredo w r ants to marry me. I don’t
want to marry him, but he keeps plead-
ing and pleading. He treats me beauti-
fully, and gives me everything I want.
But I don’t love him. What shall I
do?”
Who could advise her what to do?
Only she could make the decision.
The act went on and Alfredo con-
tinued to worship Vera and beg her to
make him happy by marrying him.
How often can one say no ? Vera saw
him every day, and every day he told
her how much he loved her, and how
miserable he would be until she was his
wife.
Finally one day Vera said yes. But
she added, “ I don’t love you, Alfredo. I
respect you, but I don’t love you.”
Alfredo brushed away her words and
cried exultantly, “You’ll learn to love
me. I’ll make you love me! ”
They were married in San Antonio,
on September iBth, 1932. The marriage
took place in San Antonio because when
the local branch of the Circus. Fans
Association —a national organisation of
circus admirers —heard of their engage-
ment they invited Alfredo and Vera to
have the ceremony performed at the
annual meeting of the association, which
was scheduled for the day the circus
came to the town.
The wedding attracted world-wide
attention. It was held before the night
show in the grand ballroom of the
Gunther Hotel, and the best rooms were
engaged for the bridal suite. The whole
circus attended, and showered the
couple with gifts and good wishes. In
true show fashion, the bride and groom
had to return to the tent, and give a
performance as if nothing had happened.
But the real celebration came later,'
when every one quickly threw off his
circus clothes and accompanied Vera
and Alfredo to the hotel.
The trapeze performers, the aerialists,
the acrobats, the riders, the freaks, all
crowded into the bridal suite and feasted
until dawn. The giant had a hard time
to squeeze in and kept bumping his head
in doorways. But he didn’t mind. He
laughed happily and toasted the couple.
And when he raised his glass, it almost
touched the ceiling. The German dwarf
and his two sisters had to climb on a
table to kiss the bride and her husband,
and I remember that the dwarf suddenly
appeared as if from nowhere, shouting
triumphantly. He had negotiated a pas-
I sage between the legs of the guests.
IT was a beautiful, gay occasion. |
Whatever the circus people knew
about Alfredo —Clara, somewhere in the
background, perhaps a dismal back-
ground; the ashes of Leitzel under her
two-thousand pound monument —they
chose not to remember at this moment.
They wanted to remember only that
Alfredo Codona loved Vera Bruce, and
from their very hearts they wished them
a happy, happy life.
The marriage was followed by the
conclusion of the circus season in
America, and then Alfredo took Vera j
for a honeymoon in Europe, working
part of the time.
I received letters from both. Alfredo i
was divinely happy. Vera wrote that
she was happy, too. But when they
returned I could see that Vera’s fears
had been realised. Alfredo had said that
he would teach his wife to love him, but
he had failed. Vera respected Alfredo ;
she had always admired him as an artist.
But love him, she could not.
Why I will not venture to say.
Alfredo was a fascinating character, but
he was not for Vera. She knew that
whatever he had done before, no matter
how he had treated women, no matter
under what circumstances he had mar-
ried Leitzel, he truly loved her —more,
he worshipped her, idolised her. But
she could not love him. She tried to be
a good wife and gave him of her best as
a professional partner, but beyond that
she had nothing to offer.
Alfredo, however, was hopeful. He
did not allow himself to doubt.
“ Mother, she loves me now, but she
does not know it,” he used to tell me.
Then, as I did not answer, for I did not
know what to answer, his face turned
momentarily pale and he cried out,
“ She must love me! I can’t live if she
doesn’t! ”
But these moods passed quickly. They I
gave place to confidence. It seemed im- |
possible that any woman could not learn J
to love Alfredo Codona; especially when j
he offered her such a great, such a f
devoted love.
One night Alfredo was doing his cele- j
brated triple somersault. With the |
lightness of a bird he launched into the
air and, while the crowds stared up- j
wards at him in awe, as they always |
did, his body turned easily and grace-
fully three times. His hands reached
for the hands of his brother, who hung
down from his trapeze bar, tensed, ready
to catch him.
But as Alfredo’s fingers were about to
slip into Lalo’s fingers, that dread some-
thing which every circus performer
religiously tries not to think of, hap-
pened. The fingers did not meet. There
was a sickening wrench as only one hand
made the contact, and then Alfredo
dropped, writhing and twisting, into the
net far below.
A cry of horror went up from the
spectators. Attendants rushed forward.
Alfredo lay groaning in the net. He
could not move.
It is supposed by the public that the
net will prevent injury in case of a fall.
That is not so. It will save the per-
former from death, unless he bounces
out of the net, but it will not save him
from injuries, sometimes very serious.
Alfredo fell awkwardly on his left shoul-
der. The miss in the air, and the fall,
wrenched his shoulder and tore the
muscles.
For three weeks he lay in the hospital
and went through several operations.
When he was discharged he knew that
he could never again work as an
aerialist.
It was a tremendous blow. All the
glory that was Alfredo Codona’s had
suddenly vanished. All the applause, all
the renown, were gone. The high
salary, the huge publicity—no more.
Alfredo went about like a man in a
dream. He could not adjust himself to
this new existence. It was an existence
that he could not conceive as being real.
C LOWLY, the merciless realisation
in that he must no longer think of
himself as one of the “ Flying Codonas.”
He had come down to earth, and there
he must remain.
He tried to be cheerful. Fie was given
a position in the circus as director of
the riders and, at the same time, he
trained a performer to take his place
with the act. But he could not be the
old Codona, and the act could not be
the same. He became irritable and had
fits of moodiness, of brooding. It was
sheer bitterness for him to see another
man fly into the air, and to hear the
applause of the audience.
Vera’s heart went out to him, but it
was in sympathy, not in love. She tried
to mask her feelings. Alfredo needed
consolation and affection, and she sub-
ordinated all her own emotions to give
these to him.
But Alfredo was not deceived. He
felt that his wife did not love him, and
he both suffered and was enraged. Dog-
gedly, lie would not admit that he was
responsible for this unhappy relation-
ship. It was not possible that Vera
was unable to love him.
kts like
me once. “ I’ve had all the women after
me. What’s the matter with vour
daughter that she does not love me ? ”
Their life together went on in'this
fashion, Alfredo feeling more and more
keenly his downfall. He and Vera
made their home in Long Beach, Cali- 1
forma, and when they went into Los I
Angeles, and \ era was engaged by the |
film studios to double in trapeze work
for some of the stars, Alfredo heard
himself referred to as “ Vera Codona’s
husband.”
His face flushed, and he cringed. He
did not blame Vera, but he could not
help feeling miserably despondent. He
refused to go to the places where he
and Vera were invited, found no
pleasure in life which Vera could share
with him. Instead, he adopted an atti-
tude of scorn or contempt towards many
persons he met, and was often abusive.
It was now the beginning of the
second season after Alfredo had been
injured. He had worked for the Tom
Mix circus in a managerial capacity,
and would probably do something of the
same sort now. The “ Flying Codonas ”
had been disbanded, and Vera was
anxious to go back to Ringling Brothers
circus, in which my son, Clary, had an
important riding act, and where there
was more opportunity for her.
Clary was eager to have her, and
Alfredo could find no good reason why
she should not join her brother’s act.
He had to make a business trip to
Chicago at that time and it was agreed
that she should go to Sarasota, the
circus headquarters, as soon as she
could.
Vera did leave for Sarasota, but when
Alfredo returned from Chicago and did
not find her at home he rushed into my
room with the cry, “ Mother, where is
Vera ? ”
“ Why, with her brother,” I replied.
“ You agreed that she should go.”
Then Alfredo went mad. I never saw
him in such a fury. He stormed, he
cursed, he threatened. Vera had no
right to go. He forbade it. He would
bring her back. He would drag her
back.
I grew frightened. I tried to reason
with him. But reason could not pene-
trate his mind. Vera had no right to
go!
He would have been hateful, had it
not been obvious that all this wild rant-
ing was only because he loved Vera
desperately. It was pitiful, and I could
not help weeping. Alfredo was suffer-
ing so.
He tried to get Vera to come back,
but Vera had already signed with the
circus, and was about to leave for New
York for the Madison Square Garden
opening.
As soon as he learned this, Alfredo
jumped into his car and drove at break-
neck speed to New York.
THERE he had the further humilia-
tion of being barred from the per-
formers’ quarters. He appeared so dis-
tracted that the manager feared he
would create some disturbance, and
forced him to wait outside, on the street,
until Vera was able to join him.
Alfredo was unable to realise the real
reason why he was excluded, and could
only think that the great Codona had
fallen so low that he was even refused
the privilege of going backstage. This
was as great a shock to him as hearing
himself called “Vera Codona’s hus-
band.”
So he paced about furiously outside,
brooding, and torturing himself, until
Vera appeared. Then he angrily re-
proached her for leaving him.
Perhaps Vera’s outstanding trait was
honesty and straight dealing. She had
told Alfredo before she married him
that she did not love him. Now she
felt that she had reached a point where
she had to tell him that their marriage
was a failure. He had hoped that she
would learn to love him, but that hope
had not been realised, and she felt it
never could be realised.
“ Alfredo,” she said, “ I am not happy
with you. Honestly, I don’t even like
you to put your hands on me. This
can’t go on. The only thing to do is
to get a divorce.”
Alfredo stared at her strangely. 1
suppose he had often thought of the
possibility that Vera would ask for a
divorce, and had formed a plan to meet
this contingency.
Fie changed his manner.
“ I only want you to be happy, Vera,”
jhe said. “ I married you on condition
that I could make you learn to love me.
I’ll pay the penalty of my failure.”
He said this as if he were Convinced
there was no other alternative but separ-
ation, and with this understanding they
i soon afterwards parted. But in a letter
j to me, he wrote:


“ I have talked to Vera and finally
she told me that she had not been happy
with me for the last two years, and
would rather be away from me. Vera
does not always know, herself, what she
wants. She is not happy here or any-
where She is a strange girl—and
until. she finds herself, and finds what
her little heart wants, she will never be
happy.”
Alfredo was still deceiving himself,
living under the illusion that Vera did
not love him because she herself was in
an unsettled state—did not know what
she wanted. Later, when he came back
to Long Beach, I could gather from
he said, that he had agreed to
Vera’s divorce plans only to make her
come to her senses. He was sure that
when she was actually faced with taking
the step to separation, she would awaken
and realise that she loved him, and had
loved him all the time.
Vera continued with the circus and
Alfredo remained in Long Beach, rest-
less, brooding, hungering for Vera.
The letters he sent her during this
period pitifully mirrored his feelings.
“ Dearest Wife Vera,” read one. “In
front of your picture I have two beauti-
ful rosebuds, one white as snow, which
stands for your character, mind and
body, also your pure heart—the other,
red, which stands for my love for you,
and fierce jealousy for all the beautiful
things you own and which are mine
only.”
In another letter, he wrote:
“My darling, I do not discuss our
love with any one; outside of telling the
world that I have the best, sweetest, and
most faithful little wife in the world. I
do this because I believe it; in fact, I
know it.
“At seven twenty-five your sweet
voice came across 3,300 miles and it
made me so happy, I almost cried —I am
glad your cold is better. I could tell
that after our little three minutes to-
gether—l lay down on the davenport
and, lonesome and blue, fell asleep think-
ing of you. Maybe something will
happen over there to make you fed up
with it, and you’ll come home to the one
who loves you more with every breath
he draws.”
A FTER the circus season was ended,
-FA-Vera returned to Long Beach. She
was affected by Alfredo’s letters, and by
the great love he bore her, but site could
see no happiness for them. It was a
hopeless existence, and the longer she
was with him, the more he would tor-
ture himself into the belief that some-
time she might be able to return his
love. She was certain that that time
would never come, and she suffered
almost as much in living this deception
as Alfredo did in craving for her love.
So she decided to go through with the
divorce and sever for all time their re-
lationship.
But when she told that to Alfredo,
and he discovered he had been wrong to
believe she would change her mind, once
she actually determined to sue for a
divorce, he became panic-stricken. His
fear that he would lose Vera took the
form, as it often had in the past year
or so, of a wild anger. Vera was
frightened. She hesitated to begin the
action, and when Alfredo saw that these
tactics kept her from leaving him, he
applied them continually.
From morning till night, he watched
Vera like a hawk. He even tried to
prevent my speaking' to her. When I
wanted to take her breakfast to her in
bed, he took the tray from my hands,
and carried it in himself. If there was
a message for Vera, he hastened to
deliver it before I could do so.
I felt great pity for him, but the situa-
tion was growing desperate. Vera was
pale and nervous. I was afraid she
would be ill. Something had to be done,
and I took it upon myself to make the
first move. Through our family doctor,
I was recommended to a good lawyer,
and told him the story. The lawyer
assured me that a divorce could be ob-
tained, and asked Vera to consult him
at once.
I returned home, found an opportunity
to speak to Vera privately, and ex-
plained what I had done.
“ To-morrow,” I said, “ tell Alfredo
that you’re going to the beauty parlour,
and while you are out see this attorney.”
Vera agreed, and the following day
managed to get to the beauty parlour
without Alfredo’s following her. From
there she hurriedly called on the lawyer,
and the necessary papers were drawn
up.
The next few months were hell for all
of us. Alfredo was alternately in tears,
or raging like a madman,. One day he
would say to Vera, “ Sweetheart, you
don’t want me any more —so I hope you
will be happy divorced.” The next day
he would almost break the door down
to get into her rooms, and threaten her
with violence if she left him.
But the law took its inevitable course,
and when Alfredo saw that Vera indeed
was slipping out of his life, he became
strangely resigned, hopelessly, sadly
resigned.
“ You don’t love me; what can I do ? ”
he said. “ I can’t stand in the way of
your happiness.”
Finally all the settlements were made.
Although under the Californian law the
wife is entitled to half of her husband’s
possessions, Vera said she wanted no
more than twelve hundred pounds, much
less than half of Alfredo’s estate.
“ I am young and I can work,” she
said, when her lawyer protested. “ I
don’t want Alfredo to give me more
than that.”
THE decree was awarded, and Vera
was free.
Because of the strain she had been
under, and to avoid possible unpleasant-
ness with Alfredo, her lawyer advised
Vera to leave town for a while. Vera
said she would think it over.
That very night there came a knock-
ing at our door. I glanced through the
window and saw Alfredo’s car outside.
We wouldn’t let him in, and after
knocking for about five minutes, he
went awayi
I then insisted that Vera take rooms
in an hotel, and the next morning she
did so. I had to remain in our house
because of my dog, which the hotel
refused to take in. About 3 a.m. a
hanging on the door woke me up. It
was Alfredo, asking, to come in. He
sounded like a lost spirit.
In the chill of the night this seemed
like a nightmare. I was afraid. Quickly
I threw a dressing-gown about me, and
slipped out of the back door. I ran up
the road to a neighbour’s house and had
them drive me to the police station.
There I got an officer to come home
with me. No one was there.
I stayed awake until six, then rushed
over to Vera.
“ You’ve got to go away! ” I cried.
“ Alfredo tried to get in last night
again.”
Vera thought I was unduly frightened,
and more for my peace of mind than for
her own safety, she agreed to leave for
a short holiday.
Both of us packed up and drove to a
ranch about four hundred miles away,
giving our address only to Vera’s
lawyer.
A few weeks later, a letter came from
the lawyer saying the money Vera was
to receive from Alfredo was ready to
be paid, and asked her to return to Long
Beach to receive it.
We drove back, first to Los Angeles,
where we stayed overnight and notified
the lawyer when we would arrive, then
to Long Beach.
When we got into town Vera tele-
phoned the lawyer, and suggested that
I call at his office for the cheque. The
lawyer agreed. Vera dropped me off at
the office building, and said she would
wait for me in a restaurant nearby.
IN the office I found Alfredo. He
came forward to greet me. “ Hello,
mother, how are you ? ”
We shook hands.
“ How’s Vera ? ” he went on.
“ Vera’s Vera,” I replied non-com-
mittally.
We sat down. Alfredo was wan, his
eyes sunken. He seemed not to know
what to say to me, and yet he was
anxious to talk.
At last he said, “ Mother, you know
what you did? You didn’t pay for the
newspapers when you left the old
house.”
I didn’t understand at the moment that
he was just marking time, taking refuge
in a random remark, and I became
quite angry.
“ I paid all the bills,” I said, “ and it
isn’t nice of you to accuse me of run-
ning away, owing people money.”
I rose and instinctively took a step
towards the door.
“ No—please, mother —don’t go ! ” he
cried. “ Come back and sit down.”
I sat down. He was silent for a
moment. Then aimlessly he put his hand
in his pocket and drew out two little
ankle socks.
“ Look, mother,” he said, “ this is all
I have of Vera. She left them on the
line.”
He touched them lightly with his lips,
then rolled them up and returned them
to his pocket. Fie shivered and looked
up at me helplessly.
“ Mother, it’s all over,” he said.
“ We’re divorced. I love Vera. I love
her very much. But if she doesn’t want
me, if she isn’t happy, I don’t want her
to stay with me. But I’d like to say
good-bye to her. Where is she ? ”
“ She’s waiting for me near here,” I
told him.
“ Then will you bring her ? I want
to say good-bye and wish her good luck.
Let us part friends. Some day she
might want a friend —sometime I might
want a friend. Won’t you bring her ? ”
It would have been heartless to refuse.
“All right. I’ll get her,” I said.
I hurried over to the restaurant.
“ You’d better come over, Vera.
Alfredo’s there, and he wants to say
good-bye to you.”
Vera hesitated. -
“ Mother, I dofft want to go. I’d
rather not see him. He may be in one
of those moods.”
“ No,” I assured her, “ lie’s all right.
He just wants to say good-bye.”
Vera rose and accompanied me back
to the lawyer’s office.
The lawyer greeted her. Alfredo
I kissed her hand, and placed a chair for
| her.
| There were a few casual remarks,
then Alfredo turned to the lawyer.
I 1 “ Would you please go out for a little
while? I want to have a talk with my
| wife.”
“ That’s up to Vera,” the lawyer
replied.
“ You may go out,” Vera told him.
The lawyer went out. Alfredo got
up and shut the door. At the same time,
as he turned to face us, his hand rested
for a moment on the lock behind his
back.
He crossed to where Vera sat. With-
out a word, he dropped on his knees and
began kissing every part of her dress.
Vera was overcome by the suffering
jso painfully expressed by Alfredo’s
i actions. He was like a man who had
i been separated from his soul,
j She struggled to her feet.
Alfredo rose, too.
Suddenly he burst out into some inco-
herent words, and before my eyes could
follow what was happening, a revolver
in Alfredo’s hand was firing at Vera.
One shot—two —three—four !
I was paralysed. Every part of my
t body seemed turned to ice. Vera fell to
the floor, blood trickling' out of her dear
body, from her head, from her breast,
| from her side.
Alfredo ignored me. He raised the
gun to his head and fired. Silently he
collapsed at Vera’s side and lay still.
Shouts outside the door brought me
to my senses. I tried to open the door.
It was locked. Alfredo had locked it.
I turned the key. The door was pushed
open, the room was filled with people,
and I knew no more.
+ 4:
Vera died the next day in the hospital.
Her last words were, “ Mother, are you
hurt ? ”
And I said, “ No, dear sweetheart, I
am not hurt.” A few minutes later she
was dead.
Alfredo died instantly. In his pocket
was found a snapshot of Vera with
these words written on the back:
“ I loved her so much I couldn’t live
without her.”
AND so came to an end the story of
Vera and Alfredo Codona. I, the
mother of Vera Codona, had brought
her to her death.
“ Bring her to me. I want to say
good-bye.”
And I had brought her to him, and
he had said his good-bye. My beautiful
young daughter now lies under a block
of granite. On it are sculptured the
words:
Peace at Last
She has peace, God rest her soul.
But what peace is there for me, knowing
how her life was cut short ?
The story of V era and Alfredo
Codona is now a legend of circus life,
told with tears in the eyes and sorrow
in the heart. It is stark tragedy. And,
as in all great tragedies, those who are
guilty of the tragedy cannot be com-
pletely blamed. Alfredo Codona loved
my daughter; loved her with a passion
that possessed him with an over-
powering force. Circumstances dis-
organised him, and helped to drive him
deeper and deeper into the blackness
from which sprang his bloody deed.
Tragedy was probably inevitable for
Alfredo Codona. But others reading of
him must take warning which I, with all
the tears and sorrow which are my lot,
cannot too strongly impress. Love can-
not be forced, and those who enter into
a loveless marriage, hoping that love
will follow, run the risk of a devastating
sequel.
Alfredo Codona said to Vera, “ Marry
me, and I will teach you to love me.”
How often have those words been
spoken before! They are false and dan-
gerous, and the world is filled with the
tragedies they have brought about.
Vera and Alfredo Codona are dead.
My plea is that the cause of their
death shall be remembered.

A trapeze artist in Wirths’ Circus
broke his neck when he fell into a

August Mohwald, 24, a member of
the Flying Meteors troupe, was
attempting to reach another artist

The big audience did not realise
that anything untoward had occurred
until attendants, followed by the
local medical officer, carried Moh-

While the show was being set up
yesterday a trotting horse, owned by
Mr. Edward White, dropped dead in

REVOLUTION
ESCAPEE
IN SYDNEY
A 1918 Russian revolution
prison escapee, Mr. A. Ras-
mussen, arrived by the Orama
yesterday to join Wirth’s Circus.
Mr. Rasmussen, who is an acrobat,
said he was captured first by the Whffe
Army, and ~ again by the Red army;
when in Moscow during the revolti*
tion.
“During the four months I waa
imprisoned I lived in fear of my life,’*
he said.
Every day a batch of prisoners
was taken into the yard and shot.
“One night I ripped my blanket to
make a rope, and escaped through tha
window of my small cell.”
After suffering shocking privations,
he added, he reached Essen, in Ger-
many, and secured a fresh passport
from the Danish Consul.

jyjRS, AAGER RASMUSSEN, who

Until two years ago she was an
acrobat with her husband, who has
come to Sydney to join Wirth’s Cir-
cus as a vaulting expert.
Mrs. Rasmussen begap stage life |
in a German ballet at the age of
three, and for 16 years was in vaude-
ville on the Continent, finally ap-
pearing, with her husband, in Ger-
man films.
“Now I do not do anything except
assist my husband in his work,” she
said.
“I do not know how long he will
be here, perhaps one or two years,
but we will be travelling all over
the place.”

Elephant Fight
Elephant fights such as this, once popular in India, are now sel-
dom seen. This was in the province of Udaipur (00-DIE-poor).
1 Their Feet Are Chained. These elephants are about to engage in a tug of
war. The chains are long enough so that one elephant, if strong enough,
can pull the other one part way up on the wall, which is about five feet high.
This fight was staged for a visiting Indian official.
2 Sometimes the Riders Are Killed. The riders, or mahouts, in charge
of the elephants, must have the beasts trained to obey every command.
Mahouts have been trampled to death in such fights. Notice how the riders
in the rear are holding to the ropes as the elephants charge.
3 Here’s How It’s Done. The elephant on the left is about to win the battle, and smiles appear on his riders’ faces ... Elephants seem to realize the
honor of winning such contests, and sometimes trumpet in triumph afterwards. The chains are for the protection of spectators, to keep the big beasts
from running wild. Generally, however, a tamed Indian elephant is so gentle a child is safe with it.
Capybara Rat. Largest of rodents, grows four feet long, weighs 75 pounds. Has
webbed feet, good swimmer. Dives into water to escape jaguars and other
enemies in its South American home. Is harmless, hunts nothing, eats bark
and water plants. Likes to lie in sun. Hide is valuable for gloves.

ACCORDING to advices from New
Zealand, the forwards selected
for the All Blacks’ team which
is to go on to England after playing
Ihree test matches in Australia, have
given universal satisfaction, although
several think that more consideration
might have been given to the claims
of youth. The forwards are a solid
lot, and average nearly 13st 71b. The
hacks appear lo be on die light side
for the heavy grounds they are likely
to encounter during an English win-
ter. as they average list. The selectors have included
G. Nepia, of Hawke's Bay, in the team as the fulli-back.
Nepia, who is a Maori, is only 19 years of age, and he
weighs 13st lib. This is his first season in the full-
back position. His methods are said to be perilous.
Mark Nicholls, of Wellington, has been selected as a
five-eighth, but he is also a-capable
full-back. Nicholls played with dis-
tinction against the Springbok com-
bination. Many of the team have played
in Sydney, including the two players
who were here last year with the
Maori' combination —J. Mill and L.
Paewai. Mill will be remembered as
the capable full-back of Ihe team, and
he gave many sterling displays during
the tour. Paewai, who is only 19
years of age, was remarkably tricky
in attack, and has many brilliant
performances lo his credit. At the conclusion of the third
test match on July 19 the team will leave for New Zea-
land. and on July 26 will sail for England.

“ my lord THE ELEPHANT.”
BY F. B. FORESTER.
So Auckland’s Zoo, which has made so
excellent a beginning, is to name ere long
an elephant among its occupants. Before
the wonderful, sagacious, mysterious beast
anives in the country, a few notes re-
specting elephants in general, and a cer-
tain famous elephant in particular, may
not be out of place.
It was the writer’s good fortune as a
child to make the acquaintance of the
celebrated Jumbo, the largest elephant
ever known in captivity. His height at
the shoulder was close upon twelve fee't.
lie was thus almost the equal of the enor.
mous Father of Elephants whose stuffed
skin occupies a prominent place in the
Natural History Museum at South Ken-
sington, a specimen of the pigmy shrew
mouse between his forefeet, thus show-
ing the striking contrast between the lar-
gest and smallest land mammals in
existence. Being an African elephant
Jumbo was, of course, possessed of im-
mense ears; and it was an impressive
sight, seen from the vantage ground of his
back, when, at a brief word from the
keeper standing on his neck, “Sail
Jumbo,’’ the huge beast spread these
enormous ears, like gigantic. fans, and
advanced down the brood walk like a
ship in full sail.
Sagacity and Strength.
Wonderful, sagacious, mysterious. He
is all that, this enormous creature with the
long, senuous trunk, the sensitive instru-
ment with which its owner can pick up
a pin or tear a man asunder. No other
creature, however perfectly adapted to its
life and surroundings, possesses an organ
like it ; the trunk of the elephant is ab-
solutely unique. The nostrils traverse its
entire length; and the very real fear of
the huge beast as regards a mouse is
thereby easily explained,, his dread being
that the tiny rodent should enter and
run up his trunk. _ There is another
point wherein the elephant differs from any
other animal. The knees, so to speak, of
his hind legs are in front, he is thus
able to kneel down as a man kneels, in
a way impossible to any other quadruped.
“ A square beast with a tail at each
end.’’ Such was the definition of an ele-
phant given by a schoolboy in a recent
examination; and considering that Kip-
ling, in the “ Jungle Book ” calls the
elephant “ Two Tails,’’ the description
is far from being inapt. There, m those
wonderful stories, a marvellous Ihi
is thrown upon the complex nature of this
sagacious beast. Who that has opened
the book can forget how Two Tails, while
willingly using his immense strength to
drag the guns towards the. firing line,
reaches a point beyond which he will
advance no further. He is too intelligent
not to understand the danger, and too
nervous to face it, and the task of drag-
ging the guns into the shot-swept aiea
has to he left to the stolid and unimagin-
ative bullocks. Huge and ponderous as he
is. it would never be thought at hrsfc
sight that the elephant is capable of mov-
ing at such a pace that it would taae
a good horse all his time to distance him j
or that, mentally, he is the possessor of
a quicker and more active brain than any
other animal, excepting only the dog.
Volumes might be written telling of the
sagacity of this king of the forest, ihe
elephant has an excellent memory, and
never forgets either friend or foe.
One reads with indignation of the at-
tack- made by ignorant hooligans on the
inoffensive creatures already m the Auck-
land Zoo, and the senseless perpetrators
of such cruelty would he well advised to
their practices before the arrival of
the elephant. He is much too big and
nowerful to he teased with impunity, and
far too sagacious to allow the perpe rato,
of injury or insult offered to him to es
cape.
A Long Life.

roanf the interior of the dark Contine

' x 0 one knows where the elephant gives
un his life- The natives speak of a my-
sterious valley somqv'here in the un-
known regions of Africa to which the ele-
gants go to die, but this spot is known
phant g ihtv beasts themselves.
Su-nteS both f-hfte and black, believe
in the existence of such a sanctuary, and
cear ch has been made for the treasure of
ivory which must be there; but so tar
at least the elephants have kept the r
secret, and long may they continue to do
The elephant shortly to reach the zoo
is coming from India, She—it is a
young female—will accordingly have
small ears compared with those* of the
African species to which the mighty
Jumbo belonged, and her head, in place
of being convex between the ears, will
be flat, or slightly concave.
If these brief notes should do anything
towards increasing public interest in the
Auckland Zoo, that v.fill be a good thing.
But, if, in some slight way, they should
help to awake in the youth of the present
day a kindlier feeling* towards the creat-
ures that we, in our sublime arrogance,
term the lower animals, that will be in-
finitely better still.
THE MIGHTY FALLEN
Passing of Jumbo
SLAIN AT ZOO
About five years ago Wirth Bros,
owned a fru% r male elephant called
"Jumbo:'" Even then he teas of
mature age, but as the years piled
up his temper became dangerous
and malicious, and he was a me-
nace to those who had the hand-
ling of him.
He had a fine pair of tusks, and for
this reason the Taronga Park Zoo ac-
quired him for show purposes.
He was then the only tusked ele-
phant in Australia, and it was never
intended that he should carry children
or women round the grounds on little
joy rides. He was too dangerous.
Some, three years ago his temper be-
came worse, and in his fits of mad rage
he broke his two tusks against the
railings of his home. As a result he
is said to have lost about 20 gallons of
blood and incidentally most of his show
value.
Even this little accident did not cool
his temper. In fact, it grew daily
worse. So vicious did he become that
his keepers went in daily fear of their
lives when attending to him.
Every precaution was taken to guard
the public.
Finally, after lengthy deliberations,
it. was unanimously decided to pass
sentence of death on the animal, and
the police authorities undertook to
supervise the details of execution.
This was carried out in the early
morning by a service rifle in the hands
of one of the best shots in the force, and
the animal was despatched painlessly.
Later in the day several medical stu-
dents from the University tried their
’prentice hands in dissecting the enor-
mous corpse. They carried out their
work efficiently, but ordinary butchers’
knives had -to be substituted for the
more delicate instruments commonly
used by the faculty.
The Trust gave Wirth Bros. £250 for
the animal, and it had earned that
amount many times over.
The corpse.-for stuffing purpose, was
offered to the Sydney and Brisbane
Museums,* but was declined. These in-
stitutions have a plethora of dead ele-
phants.

FATAL SMASH
LOGAN VILLAGE
TRAGEDY
LENGTHSMAN’S WIFE
KILLED
In endeavouring to open the \
gates at a crossing near Logan Vil- j
lage, to allow a circus train to 1
pass through, the. wife of a rail- r
way lengthsm&n was struck by the *
train, and mortally injured.
BEENLEIGII, Friday .—A terrible I
tragedy occurred at four o’clock this j
morning, when Mrs. B. Scott,
a lengthsman, residing at Logan Vil-1
lage railway gates, was fatally injured. 1
The first division of Mirths’ circus I
train, proceeding from Bcaudcscrt to!
Beenleigh, had reached Taylor ’s gates
on the Tambourine road, near Logan j
Villages. As the gates were not opened,
Mr. and Mrs. Scott, on hearing the
train, rushed out to open them. Scott
succeeded in getting his half open, but j]
his wife was not so fortunate. She was |
caught by the engine, and, with the!
gate, was carried 30 yards down the j
line, sustaining terrible injuries. Her|
left’ leg below the knee was badly:
pulped, the right ankle fractured,!
several ribs broken, her face lacerated,'
and she also sustained internal in-
juries.
Dr. M* Gregor and the Beeaieigli am-
bulance proceeded to the scene. The
injured woman was attended to, but on
the way to the hospital in the am-
bulance she expired at Loganlea.
Deceased leaves a husband and four
children, the eldest a girl of 19 years,

“CARDIE” SHOT,
ELEPHANT’S FATE.
SEQUEL TO TREACHER A
WIKTH’S HEAVY LOSS.
UNIQUE SCENE AT ENQGGERA.
A green paddock on the banks of
Kedron Brook, Brisbane, was the scene
, yesterday morning of a unique event'
j • n the history of Queensland—-the shoot-
| tng of an elephant. The animal paid
the extreme penalty for savaging Ring-
| master Cook at Wirth’s Circus on
| Friday night. The huge brute had
offended more than once before, and
was deemed too treacherous to take
any further risWFwith, both in regard
to the staff and the public. Its sum-
mary execution means a loss of £l5OO
to the circus.
A strange procession crossed Victoria
Bridge and made its way out to Enog-
gera yesterday morning. “Cardie," the
performing elephant of Wirth's Circus,
could be seen unconcernedly ambling along
the roadway, ridden by its keeper (Air. Lee)
and followed by a large crowd of boys
and girls. The reason for the early
morning walk was that “Cardie," who
had become bad tempered of late, had
savaged his trainer at the performance on
Friday night (a report of the affair had
appeared in Saturday’s “Courier"), and the
management had decided that he '.should
be destroyed news spread quickly,
and the crowd had become" Swollen to
hundreds by the time they the
paddock of Air. A. E. Simpson on the
edge of Kedrovi brook. Tire execution
was watched by a very interested audience
who took up their position, on a hill
near by. “Cardie" was despatched very
swiftly. His two front legs were chained
to a tree and his hind legs to pegs. Con-
stables .Hall, of the Traffic Office, took
aim at his heart and Constable Ega»
of Roma-street at his left temple. The
General Manager of Wirth's Circus (Mr.
G. Anderson), blew a sharp blast on his
whistle, two shots rang out, and “Car-
die" sank slowly on to his hind legs, then
on to his front, legs, and rolled on his left
side —dead. As a precautionary measure
four more shots were fired into the body
A WONDERFUL ELEPHANT.
The circus was very reluctant to part
with “Cardie." He joined them twenty-
five years ago, as a five-year-old infant,
and they have watched him grow up
until he became the strongest elephant,
in the troupe of thirteen belonging to the
circus. His feats of strength as well
as his wonderful tricks on the sawdust
had become the pride of every acrobat,
clown, and hand in the show. Along an
ordinary road he could pull a load of 35 tons
or more, and could move from fifteen to
twenty railway carriages. On one mem-
orable occasion in Victoria be leaned his
bulk of three tons and lOcwt. against a
railway T- class engine, which had refused
to start, and gave it the necessary push
to set it going. A'o one was more sad
than Lee, Iris keeper, who had looked
after the animal for eight years, and
with whom the animal seemed to have
formed almost a human friendship. When
the time of the execution was reached,
unable to witness the death of his animal
friend, he left the scene five minutes before
the shots were fired.
SAFETY FIRST. . .
The safety of the public was the con-
sideration which finally settled the late
ot “Cardie," and for this reason Mi.
George Wirth, and the General Manager
(Mr. G. Anderson), decided that he
should be destroyed, although this meant a
loss of about £l5OO to the firm. ttwas,
of course, possible to have pun is *ed C
lie" for his misdeed, but the management
were very diffident of applying the
method which is used m India tor this
purpose. This consists ot stretching
the elephant by placing his legs on four
wooden blocks and extending tne legs
in different directions, and then making
another elephant lash him with chains
until he is completely coweu.
ONEROUS OFFENCES.
Friday night’s occurrence was by no
rwnis the first occasion on which Ldi-

FATAL EXPLOSIONS.
TWO CIRCUS MEN
KILLED.
ACCIDENT AT BLAYNEY
SYDNEY, dune 3.
A terrific explosion at Sole’s Circus,
which arrived at Blayney on Saturday,
| resulted in two persons being killed.
The circus was about to be lit up for
the evening performance, when ihe acety-
lene gas plant exploded. W. Sole (the 1
proprietor) and C. Eroni were killed.
PARTICULARS OF THE EXPLOSION.
The explosion occurred while repairs
were being effected to a leaky pipe on
the acetylene gas generator. A portable
electric lighting plapt having failed, it
I was decided to requisition an old acety-
-1“ lene plant carried for emergencies.
Messrs. Sole and Perry were working
together, and discovered a leak in the
pipe used for conveying the gas from
the cylinder. The pipe was bound round
with tape to prevent the escape of gas.
■ By this time it was quite dark, and one
g of the men, evidently with the intention
aof seeing if the leak had been stopped,
j| struck a match. There was immediately
Bi* loud explosion, and both men were
I thrown on their backs some distance
| away. William Alfred Sole was aged j
I 54, and married. He was one of the pro- !
I prietors of the circus, which was re-
I cently purchased. Charles Henry Perry
I was 55 years of age, and married, and
I was professionally know' as “Eroni.” i
| Strangely enough, one of the ladies
■ associated with the show had a present-
I ment, and had spoken oi it, saying the
I visit to Blayney would be ill-fated.
I Members of the company ran to the two
I men, and it was at once seen that Perry J
j was dead. His skull had been cleaved 1
( right down the centre. Mr. Sole was
' terribly bruised about the face and
head, and expired in a few minutes.
Both men were members of the Victorian
Constitution of the Masonic Order, and
were well known and highly respected ’
showmen right throughout the Common-
wealth and New Zealand. Mr. Sole left a
widow, three sons, and three daughters,
all employed in the circus, and Mr.
Perry _a widow and four sons, who as-
sisted in the circus management.
GAS EXPLOSION.
TWO MEN KILLED.
Another acetylene explosion occurred
on Sunday, the scene being outside
Sole’s Circus, at Blayney, N.S.W., when
a gas tank exploded and two men were
killed. The victims were William Al-
fred Sole (34), who left a wife and six j
children, and Charles Henry Perry, pro-
fessionally known as Charles Eroni
(55), also with a wife and six children.
The two men were respectively pro-
prietor and manager of a circus, which
was to have shown at the towm on Sat-
urday night.
When the accident occurred they
were engaged in repairing a cylinder,
containing acetylene gas, to illuminate
the circus arena and had a naked light
examining the union between the tank
and the reticulation pipes. The tank
blew up with terrific force, and an iron
bar, two feet long, struck both men on
the head, and shattered their skulls. 1
Perry lived for 20 minutes, and Sole for
one hour after the disaster. 1

Yesterday Mi. J. Washington Irving,
M.R.C-V.8., conducted a post-mortem
examination of “Cardie,’ 'Wiritis’ bi|
elephant, who was court-marshalled
and shot for having savaged the ring-
master on Friday.
The autopsy took place at Mr. A. E. 1
Simpson’3 paddock, at AMerley, where
the animal was executed on Sunday
morning.
Mr. Irving reported: “A heart as
large as a big bucket. One bullet
found in it. All organs perfectly
sound. Teeth superficially examined
and found not to be decayed."
Mr. Irving said that he attributed :
the strange outbursts to which the
annual was subject at certain times
purely to natural causes. The teeth i
of the elephant, he remarked, wera
like two great bricks.

NEW ZEALAND
PREPARES
POWERFUL INTER-ISLAND
TEAMS CHOSEN
The Players * Form Discussed
(By The Referee Special.)
WELLINGTON, June 23.—The inter-
island match is to be played at Christ-
church on Saturday, July 2.
North Island.—Full-back, Kingston;
three-quarters, Grierson, Algar and Ait-
ken; five-eighths, C. Badeley and Sven-
scn; half, Roberts; wing-forward, Lucas;
forwards, Carroll, Hughes, Kissick, Mof-
fitt, West, McLean and Beilis; emergen-
cies, Nicholls, Masters and Donald.
South Island. —Full-back, Evans; three-
quarters, Ford, Storey and Phillips; five-
eighths, Jeffs and D, McCormick; half,
Connolly; wing-forward, Baird; forwards,
Peterson, Whyte, Turnbull, McLean,
Richardson, Duncan and Ellis; emergen-
cies, Steele, Russell, Scott and Snow.
The North Island team is strong. A
lot of grumbling, however, is coming
from the country districts, especially
those on the East Coast, because no
players from those places are selected.
But it was ever thus, and many fine
players in the past who -\Vould have done
credit to New Zealand as Dominion re-
presentatives have been similarly passed
by.
Many people expected K. Ifwerson, the
ex-League player to get the full-back
position, but Kingston, who played in
Auckland last season, was reckoned then
to be on a par with J. G. O'Brien, the
New Zealand full-back. This young
fellow is in Taranaki this season, and is
an athlete of parts.
The three-quarter line is good. Aitken
has just returned from Sydney, where he
shewed his capabilities as a member of
the New Zealand University team. Grier-
son and Algar are both capable men.
The only complaint I have against the
back division is the non-inclusion of
H. E. Nicholls, the Wellington half-back.
I consider him the best man in tfcat posi-
tion in New Zealand to-day, and with a
fine, solid pack in front of him, such as
this North Island team is composed of,
he would have been in the limelight all
the time.
Of course. E. Roberts had to go in
the team, but it is as a five-eighth
where he is better than a half —that he
should have been played. C. Badeley,
the Aucklander, is a bright and dashing
young player, and so also is Svenson, the
Wanganui lad. But the latter could
have easily been the emergency instead
of Nicholls.
Lucas, the wing forward, was pre-
ferred by the Auckland selector for this
position last year, and he had Singe
available, a man who with the New Zea-
land Army team built up a big reputa-
tion for himself in England.
The only forward I don’t really like
is Carroll, from Manawatu, but he is of
the same build as Hughes, and that must
have weighed with the selectors. The
scrammage itself is a fine one, with fel-
lows like Beilis, Moffit, Wesby, McLean,
and Kissick —all big enough and fit
enough to fight for a kingdom. The ab-
sence of Jacobs, the burly Maori from
Hcrowhenua, and Fletcher, a fine Auck-
land forward, is noticeable, but there
were only seven places in the pack.
The South Island team is solid, al-
though the inclusion of one or two came
as a surprise. Evans, the young Canter-
bury full-back, pleased the critics last
year, and would have taken a lot of
leaving out. The tussle between Kings-
ton and Evans for this position in the
New Zealand team to play against South
Africa should be worth while.
The dropping of Steele, of the West
Coast, from the three-quarter line, is one
of the surprises. It is said that he is
not showing his form this season, but his
display in last year’s inter-island match,
seemed to stamp him as one of the finds
of New Zealand football. Phil’ips, who
has taken Steele's place, is a very fine
player, and in the Seddon Shield match
in Marlborough last year played a better
game than the West Coaster. Phillips
has been included in Mr. W. T. Parata's
Maori team to visit Sydney early next
month,
Storey’s selection was a certainty, but
I cannot understand the dropping of
Fea. of Otago University, in favor of
Jeffs. But as they both play in Dunedin,
the Otago men on the selection com-
mittee must have had good grounds for
the suggestion he made in this connec-
tion. D. McCormick, the Canterbury
Marist player, is a fine five-eighth, and
should get very near the New Zealand
team.
’There are a dearth of half-backs of
class in the South Island, as Connolly
(Marlborough) was the only one nomi-
nated for the position, and, of course, he
gel it. Baird, Feter.son, Duncan and
McLean are all fine forwards, and worthy
of their places. Ellis’ inclusion is chal-
lenged, but Whyte, of Southland, is highly
spoken of.
The New Zealand selectors of the team
to play against the South Africans have
claimed the right to go outride the players
in this inter-island match if they desire
to do so, but it would be a remarkable
thing if a man got Dominion honors, and
was not considered good enough for the
inter-island team. With the South Afri-
cans in Australia the interest in their
visit to these parts is very marked, and
the indications are that they will be re-
ceived everywhere by crowds in the na-
ture of a record line fofi New Zealand.
!Eroni Bros.’ Circus, now in West
Australia, has the following roster: —
►Shields & Warren, La Belle Zuida, Joe
Clarke, C. Ernoi, Nellie Stone, Stella
Ashton; Charles Durant, The Klentos,
George Eroni, Foolish Ford, Lottie
Mackay, and a fine lot of high jump-
ing horses and performing animals. E.
J. Clarke is representative, Claude
Phillips director. George Holmes master
of stud, Gus Lynch animal trainer,
and George Cooper boss canvas man.
SPRINGBOKS ,
VICTORS
NEW ZEALAND DEFEATED
IN SECOND TEST
Won by a Dropped Goal: Thirty
Thousand People Present ; A
Stern Struggle
(By Cable, from The Referee Special)
AUCKLAND, Saturday.
The second Test match between New
Zealand and South Africa under Rugby
Union rules attracted 30,000 people to the
Auckland Domain. The weather was per-
fect for football, there being no wind,
while the sun shone brightly, making the
spectators happy.
The teams proved well matched, the
scoring being small, with the Springboks
getting even with their conquerors in
Dunedin by scoring 9to 5. Each side
scored a converted try, but the South Af-
ricans added a dropped goal from the
field, which proved to be the winning
points.
SOUTH AFRICA.—G. Morkel, full-
back; Henry Morkel, W. Sendin, Clark-
son, and Zeller, three-quarters; Michau
and, Du Meyer, half-backs; Boy Morkel,
R. Morkel, Ellis, Vkn Rooyen, Mostert,
1 Kruger, Scholtz, and Du Plessis, for-
. wards.
NEW ZEALAND.—Kingston, fal-
lback; Storey, Aitken, Steele, three-quar-
ters; M. Nicholls, C. Badeley, five-eights;
,E. Roberts, half-back; Donald, Hughes,
Duncan, McLean, Moffitt, Richardson,
West, and Beilis, forwards.
' SPRINGBOKS SCORE FIRST.
New Zealand kicked off facing the sun,
' and play was at once rushed to the South
African 25. The ball went out at the
corner, following which a free to Africa
was the means of transferring play to the
other end.
After some even play R. Morkel made
a fine run from half-way, but was stopped
near the line. New Zealand rushed play
to midfield, but Meyer and Du Plessis
returned with dashing runs. Play was
in the New Zealand 25 for a quarter of
an hour. Then Van Rooyen broke away,
made a good opening and whipped a pass
to Sendin, who ran in to score a fairly
easy try, which G. Morkel converted.
Africa 5 to nil.
BLACK FORWARDS SCORE.
Brisk play preceded another move to-
wards home territory. Meyer then opened
out the game, and the centre three-quar-
ters got it to Harry Morkel, who, run-
ning well, looked like scoring, but was
stopped by the full-back, Kingston. After
gome loose play a good run by Beilis, who
was stopped by Zeller, meant danger.
The ball went to McLean, one of the for-
wards, who scored in the corner. Nicholls
converted —£ points all.
No further scoring took place up to
half-time. Play had been fairly open,
but lacked brilliancy. New Zealand so
far had shown a trifle the better form.
A£ the South African 25, early in the
second half, New Zealand got possession
of the ball from a scfummage, and the
halves and three-quarters put in some fine
passing, with Roberts, Badeley, Nichol s
and Storey in it. But Storey lost the
ball, and Clarkson, getting to it, kicked
back to half-way. A South African rush
was started by Michau, but ended with a
long kick over the dead-ball line.
South Africa attacked zealously until
a penalty kick taken by Roberts rcllevea
the home team. Then New Zealand at-
tacked, but Steele was downed in the
C °The ball was worked by the South
Africans back to half-way where Zeller
broke away with a splendid run down
the touch-line. Roberts dived and stopped
him within a few feet of the goal-line.
Michau and H. Morkel were prominent
in another burst, but Kingston and
Badeley returned the ball to tne other
end, it going out at the corner.
Play remained in the visitors’ quarter
for some minutes. The South Africans
were hard pressed till relief came from a
line-kick. From 30yds Roberts missed
with a pot at goal, and Africa forced.
Nicholls also had a shot ana the ball
dropped under the bar.
FULL-BACK WORKEL'S GREAT GOAL.
A long kick relieved the tension, and
transferred play to New Zealand terri-
tory, where Kingston slipped with an op-
ponent right on top of him, but Beilis
got there in time and kicked the &au
dC G L Morkel, the full-back, then kicked
a wonderful field goal from 40 yards out,
and South Africa led by 9 to 5.
A little later Michau kicked to the
corner. The bounce beat full-back
Kingston, but also evaded the Africans,
who were in hot pursuit, and went out in
the corner. South Africa got going
again just after, but were stopped by
Steele intercepting a pass from Clarkson.
With play at the South African end,
New Zealand tried hard to score in the
closing stages, but met a very resolute
and able defence. The game finished
with the Blacks still in attack. Though
New Zealand were the more aggressive
side, the South Africans on the whole
proved a trifle the better combination,
and deserved the win.
BETTER TEAM WON.
Though South Africa, on play, should
have won in any case, they would not
have done so but for the coolness and
accurate kicking of Gerhard Morkel
Apart from this, however, all impartial
critics admit that, on the day, the better
team won.
It was essentially a day in which all
the conditions favored the South Africans
showing their best form —and they did so.
And their best was almost, but not quite,
equalled by the New Zealand display.
They put pound for pound in the for-
wards.
But the South Africans really outlasted
the New Zealanders. They timed their
efforts better. They jumped into their
game early, and put more pace and snap
into the close passing than the Black
vanguard showed at any time.
Their bunch-passing too frequently had
the New Zealanders puzzled to fit‘d_the
ball, thus giving their scrum-half clean
opportunities to set his backs going. It
is true that it seemed to many that
penalties for obstruction and forward
handling should often have been im-
posed on the South Africans. But it is
their game, and came off. In the open,
ruck and loose dribbling play, the' Blacks
were superior. There was little between
the forwards in line-out play and scrum-
maging ability.
One place where South Africa laid the
foundation of the win was among the
inside backs. Snap and resource marked
their attacking work, and it was a shade
ahead of the game of the Black five-
eighths and centre, who, while sound,
lacked lightning initiative to punch holes
in the defence. This initiative was
looked on as a great winning charac-
teristic of New Zealand International
teams in the past.
[iThe bunch-passing mentioned is car-
ried out by the South African forwards
moving together, shoulder to shoulder,
and handing the ball to one another as
they run. The ball is not passed; it is
handed, on.]

Honors Easy in the Tests ,
Scoreless Draw m Final Match in
Wet Weather at Wellington
(By Cable from The Referee Special.)
Wellington, Saturday.—The third and
final Test match betv/een New Zealand
and South Africa, at Wellington to-day,
ended in a scoreless draw. Thus honors
are easy, each side having won, lost, and
drawn a match.
Public interest in the contest was un-
exampled in the Dominion, not that a
brilliant, thrilling, or spectacular game
was expected—for the methods of the
Springboks and the form of the New
Zealanders this year did not create hopes
of that nature. It was the winning of
the rubber that mattered, New Zealanders,
in face of the disappointing form of their
men in the other matches, fearing that
the South Africans might carry the day.
Rain had fallen all the morning, and
was still falling when the game began
on the Basin Reserve. The attendance,
nevertheless, was 30,000

forwards at once became aggressive. Bei-

Kingston saved splendidly. With play
still in the New Zealand 25, half-back
Michau passed to van Heerden, who was
thrown out near the corner. Still in New
Zealand’s 25, the Blacks were penalised,
but G. Morkel’s shot at goal was charged
down.
The ball was worked down the field
to full-back Morkel, who put in a splen-
did kick, the ball going out near the
corner. Here Roberts took a clever
n ark, and the kick saved the Blacks from
danger. Steel, the three-quarter back,
was in great form for the home team.
Twice he broke away along touch,
making fine runs, but was well tackled.
A little later New Zealand were de-
fending for some time. Then Siddells
changed the venue. But the South
Africans were getting the ball from the
line-out, and attacked again, and Roberts
forced just in the nick of time. Play
continued of a fast, strenuous order, with
New Zealand defending hard till just
before half-time, which ended with
neither side having scored.
STILL THE RAIN.
Rain was still falling when the second
spell was opened. South Africa attacked
at once, and Ifwersen forced. Then
South Africa opened up a passing rush,
with Michau, Meyer and Zeller in it
Zeller very nearly got over the line.
However, the Blacks broke away up the
field. But the South Africans were
playing a sound defensive game, which
was very close, but not spectacular. G.
Merkel, the full-back, was showing great
ferm for the Springboks. On several occa-
sions he saved his side. Eventually the
South African forwards came with a.
great rush right down the field to the j
New Zealand line, but Roberts forced
down close to the goalposts.
By neat forward rushes New Zealand
forced their way back and went close to
scoring, but could not get through the
defence.
REFEREE DOWN TO IT.
Play was still keen and of such a strenu-
ous order that the referee was tempo-
rarily knocked out. Towards the close
New Zealand’s play improved consider-
ably. They had the best of the rest of
the game. Keen excitement prevailed
when Ifwersen secured the ball in the
Springbok’s 25, cut in, and kicked, but
the ball crossed the goal line and the
Springboks forced.
SUMMARISED.
Play continued fast and hard, but there ;
was no score when time sounded. In
the first spell the South Africans mon-
opolised the attack, and in the second (
spell the New Zealanders did likewise.
Though the defence was not penetrated 1
in either half, the slightest bit of effi-
ciency would have given either side the
advantage. The Springboks’ champion
forward was Van Rooyen, who stood
out on his own. Of the half-backs,!
Michau and Meyer worked well with
their forwards, who were great in de-
fence. G. Morkel (full-back) played a
wonderful game. Line-kicking stood out
as a feature. Zeller, on the wing, got
few opportunities, but played a good
(game. Van Heerden, on the other
wing, lacked determination. A draw
was a very fair result of a game which
was far from spectacular, this being due
to the state of the ground.
SOUTH AFRICA IS PLEASED.
The cables flashed the following mes-
sage back from Cape Town very sharply
after the result of the third Test was
made known:—
“Capetown, September 17.—The re-
sult of Saturday’s wonderful match at
Wellington is received with unbounded
satisfaction, as a fitting end to the mag-
nificent tour. Whatever disappointment
may be felt at the indecisive outcome of
the Test matches was swallowed up in
gratification of a successful tour. It i«
regarded as a complete vindication of the
Springboks’ tactics. There is general ap-
preciation of splendid sportsmanship of
the New Zealanders, and their over-
whelming hospitality to the visitors.”
The tactics of the Springboks are no-
thing to rave about. If anything, they
mean heavy close forward play and the
use of the touch-line. Very sound, but
not spectacular.

SPRINGBOKS AND FINAL TEST : N.S.W. TEAM RETURNS
The Springboks and All Blacks will play the deciding Test match at Welling-
ton on Saturday next. As each side has won once, the final tilt promises to work
* up to a great tension in public interest throughout Rugby circles in New Zealand.
Matters appear to be shaping in the direction of a record crowd for New Zealand,
if the weather be fine. The other two matches drew exceptional attendances. And
1 while the struggle for mastery was tense, the class of football appears to have been
I inferior to that which New Zealand people were accustomed to prior to the war.
' This is possibly due to two causes, one the drop in the quality of the average player
compared with that of ten years ago, the other that the New Zealand forwards,
usually so dangerous, have not been able to break down the solidity of the South
African scrummagers and make openings to the chalk-mark for themselves o.r their
backs. On the form of the other two matches, the Springboks appear to have the
New Zealand selectors thinking hard. The visitors will probably be favorites, a
most unusual thing when New Zealand is in the field anywhere, but above all on
a New Zealand ground.
There has been some talk of the South Africans playing in Sydney again prior
to leaving for home. But there would be little interest in a match in cricket
weather, with all interest centred on the sports of Spring and Summer, unless it
could be played on cither of the next two Saturdays.


Twenty Years of Vaudeville
AT the Tivoli Theatre, Melbourne
every regular patron knows Mr.
Percy Crawford, who for just over
two decades has been identified in
one w r ay and another with 1 the
Tivoli Theatres circuit, commencing
first under the management of that
great old pioneer, the late Harry
Rickards.
Our Southern representative re-
cently had a most interesting chat
with Mr. Crawford, when it was
gleaned that the latter first joined
Harry Rickards in Sydney during
1902, when he occupied the menial
position of box office keeper. The
attraction of a vaudeville theatre
was always a strong pull to young
Crawford, and he determined to do
his utmost to work up to the high-
est position offering. How well he
succeeded is borne out at the pre-
sent da y.
“We had some wonderful per-
formers when I first joined the
circuit,” said the subject of this
interview, “and the first big act
during my time was Paul Cinque-
villi, billed as the Incomparable
Juggler. Never before or since
has his work been equalled on a
variety stage. In those days, the
first half of the programme con-
sisted of a scene done by the ballet
and chorus, in addition to the four
cornermen, and occupied a little
over half an hour. Amongst those
blackfaced performers were Charlie
Fanning, Ed. E. Ford, Frank
Yorke, Will Whitburn, George
Bentley, Les. Warton and several
coloured performers, including the
famous team of Sayles & Pope. The
second half of the programme was
comprised of a big star act, two
medium supporting acts, imported,
a few of the local singles sand-
wiched in between, with a farce
to finish, played by the first part
performers.
“One of the most successful of
these farces was that played by
Irving Sales, entitled, “Count Pon-
gowosky.’ Many funny stories could
be told of Irving, who was beloved
Iby all, and no doubt was a big box
office attraction. When on the
stage, he always did his best.
“Will Whitburn was also a big
; favourite, Melbourne being his
stronghold. T shall never forget
his return to the stage, if mem-
ory serves me rightly, in about
1912 or 1913, after an absence of
seven years. The ovation he re-
ceived that night was something
to be remembered. But this is get-
ting away from my own gradual
rise in the Firm. .
“After serving approximately
three years in the box office, I was
appointed on the clerical staff of
the Tivoli Theatre, Sydney, carry-
ing out general duties, and about
twelve months later was appointed
treasurer, under Mr. Fred. Aydon,
to tour New Zealand with a vaude-
ville show headed by Paul Cinque-
valli; and what a wonderful tour
it was —Success from the jump. It
was hard work, and evidently I
had pleased the management, for
I was retained in New Zealand to
look after the Harry Rickards’ in-
terests for another tour that fol-
lowed, headed by Chung Ling Soo.
Mr. Aydon having had to return to
Melbourne, owing to he being the
licensee of the Opera House Ho-
tel. This tour even eclipsed that
of Cinquevalli from the financial
point of view. At the conclusion of
this trip, I returned to Australia,
and was appointed treasurer of
the old Tivoli Theatre (King Wil-
liam Street), Adelaide, under Mar-
tin Marcus. That was in the days
when the horse trams ran down
King William Street.
“During the course of the next
three years I made an average of
two visits a year in charge of tour-
ing companies through New Zeal-
and, for the same Firm, always
returning to Adelaide to take up
my treasuryship duties there.
“During my first tour of New
Zealand with Cinquevalli, I be-
came very attached to Mr. Fred.
Aydon, -who gave me every chance!
and every assistance to make good,,
and, on my subsequent journeys'
from Adelaide through Melbourne!
to Sydney, to New Zealand, I al-
ways managed to arrange to spend
a day with him, which strength-
ened my friendship and made me
evermore eager to endeavour to
work under him in Melbourne, and
it is this gentleman I thank for
arranging my appointment as trea-
surer under him at the then Opera
House, Melbourne. Mr. Aydon was
very thorough, with the result that
one was always doing his best
which instilled into me that thor-
oughness was one of the finest
things in business. In those days,
his manner of dealing with artists
was just, although at times the
artists may not have appreciated
it; but he was always fair, and I
can honestly say that I have never
known him to do an action that
was not so. The artist always had
the benefit of the doubt.
“To-day, of course, the vaude-
ville world has altered considerab-
ly. Now the artists (lots of whom
are earning good salaries) are sav-
ing and take more care of them-
selves than they did ten to twenty
years ago. In those times, the ma-
jority of artists earned good money
and spent it freely. Still, that is
only by the way.
“During Mr. Hugh D. Mclntosh’s
regime, I still remained in Mel-
bourne, and business ran along on
similar lines until the great -war
commenced, when from vaudeville
we branched off into revue, musical
comedy, comedy, and the great
production of ‘Chu Chin Chow.’
It is the latter production that was
most wonderful. If the public
could have only seen how the suc-
cessful launching of this show was
brought about they would realise
this.
“I take my hat off to H.D.M. He
worked night and day, not only
directing, but in many other ways,
and there were many occasions
when his coat was well off to it.
To think that the time the produc-
tion was being produced no less
than three halls, apart from the
theatre stage, and dress circle
foyer, were in use, rehearsing, to-
gether with the store where pro-
perty makers were working, paint
frame, where scenic artists were
putting the finishig touches on the
scenery that had already been im-
ported from London; and whilst all
this was going on, the auditorium
of the theatre was re-decorated, re-
carpeted, seating re-upholstered,
and the whole achieved within four
weeks, it was really amazing, and
speaks most wonderfully for the
directorship of H.D.M. I could
talk probably the best part of an
hour on this production alone, but
space does not permit doing so.
“It was practically 6.30 on the
night that the production opened
that the last scene (lighting effects)
was rehearsed. There was an
enormous crowd waiting outside,
who eventually burst in the doors
and made way into the theatre,
they having procured their tickets,
of course, earlier in the day. I was
quietly reprimanded, which was
really not my fault, as the Govern-
ing Director had thought that I
had opened the doors; but this in-
stance was amicably adjusted over
a glass of wine at the conclusion
of the show. It was a memorable
night.
“After the opening of the pro-
duction, I was the recipient of a
gold watch and chain and a cheque
from Mr. Mclntosh and I was then
appointed business manager, Mr.
Fred. Aydon being appointed gen-
eral manager.
“As the general public know, the
production of ‘Chu Chin Chow’
ran 11 weeks of phenomenal busi-
ness. The figures would stagger
many if I were to put them in
print here, and, considering dur-
ing its run, Melbourne experienced
a coal strike, it would be even still
harder to believe.
“Just after this, of course, the
change took place—the business
then reverting over to Musgrove’s
Theatres Pty. Ltd., of which Mr.
Harry G. Musgrove is the Govern-
ing Director. Prior to this change
we played a two weeks’ season of
Gilbert and Sullivan Operas, which
l took charge of on behalf of the
J.C.W. firm, and, incidentally per-
mit me to state, during my years
of theatrical business, I have been
associated with vaudeville, revue,
musical comedy, comedy, Gilbert
and Sulivan operas.
“The first nine months of the
Musgrove regime were confined to
First National Films which even
added a further class of show to my
already long list—namely, pictures.
Gradually vaudeville acts were in-
troduced with the pictures, which,
no doubt, convinced Mr. Musgrove
of the possibilities of the Tivoli
shows coming back into their own
—vaudeville, hence the visit of
Wiilkie Bard which is still fresh in
the memories of lovers of good
vaudeville; followed by Ella
Shields, J. W. Rickaby, Tivoli Fro-
lics, Bert Gilbert, Talbot O’Farrell,
Two Rascals, George Carney, Wee
Georgie Wood, Lee White and Clay
Smith, Malcolm Scott, Ethel Hook
Gene Gerrard, Burr & Hope, Monks
of St. Bernard.
“You ask me how I would com-
pare the present day vaudeville
pi ogrammes with those of 15 years
ago ? Without hesitation T say
that the present vaudeville pro-
gramme as now appearing at the
Tivoli Theatre Melbourne, is far
superior.
“Every credit is due to Harry G.
Musgrove for his enterprising spir-
it in giving the Australian public
the best of oversea artists when-
ever oossible.
His desire also to assist local
talent has been borne out by the
many Australians who, from time
to time, figure on his programmes.
“Going back over the past, I have
many happy recollections, whilst
my association with artists of the
time has been most pleasing. Pro-
minent stars who figured on the
Tivoli bills since first I entered the
services, include the following:
Ernest Fitts, Seeley and West

(By “TRUDGEN”)
Not satisfied with the wonderful re-

beat trudgeon crawl stroke, America is
still experimenting with a similar stroke,
but with a ten-beat leg-thrash.
Miss Adelaide Lambert, a Baltimore
schoolgirl, has mastered the ten-beat

can schoolgirl, who recently won the
ladies’ championship of the Panama
Canal zone, swimming a ten-beat

crawl stroke, and recently won the cham-
pionship of the Panama Canal zone. Some
doubts were expressed as to her times,
but these were laid at rest when, in the
Kew York Women’s Swimming Associa-
tion bath, she covered 100yds. in 68sec.
Miss Lambert’s stroke is described as
beautifully even and slow, and she glides
through the water easily and without
apparent effort.
It is predicted that she will in all pro-
bability be one of America’s swimming
team at the Paris Olympiad.
“ CARDIE ” PAYS TIE PENALTY,
Savage Elephant Shot.
"Cardie,” alias Lord Cardigan, the
elephant who savaged Mr. J. W.
Cooke, Wirth’s circus ringmaster, on
Friday night, lias paid the penalty
with his life. On Sunday morning
he was led out to a paddock at New*
market and shot by two constables.
When Wurth’s decided to get rid ojj
tlie brute, attempts were made to dis-
pose of him to various zoological so-
cieties, but with no avail. He was
said to be worth £l5OO.
When he reached the place of exe-
cution he was secured by front and
hind legs to trees, while crosses weio
chalked on his hide to direct the
marksmen’s aim, and “Cardie” went
the way of all bad elephants.
The shooting was done by Constable
Hall, of the traffic police, and Con-
stable Egan, of Roma-street, with .303
rifles.
Cardie was about 30 years old, and
had been with the circus for 25 years..
He was an exceptionally powerful ai)s-
- and could pull 35 tons or mare
along the road.
The execution drew a big cr/nvd,
particularly of youngsters, many of
whom followed Cardie from the city
pn his last walk.
The museum authorities are’making
arrangements to secure Cardie’s
skeleton for reconstruction in th o
museum.
. A post-mortem examination of the
body will be conducted at 2.3,0 p.m. to-
day at the place of execution.
BULL VS. FORD
Elephant Wins Contest with a
Tractor
Kansas City, May 9.
An act not on the bills was pulled
off by an elephant with a small
circus at Lancaster, Missouri, last
week. The circus, a wagon show,
had started to leave town, when
“Tex,” an Indian elephant, balked,
and efforts of the circus people
failed to jget him started. A Ford
tractor whs hitched, by a chain, to
his fore feet, the.engine started and
the fun commenced.
“Tex” headed in another direc-
tion, walking away with the tractor
as though it was a toy. The driver
jumped in time to escape injuries.
When the “bull” was stopped the
tractor was out of commission.
About this time the elephant’s
trainer was brought from a sick
bed, directed the chaining pf the
rebel between two other elephants
and it was led away.
DIVORCE COURT TOLD
WIFE SEEKS ALIMONY
: An analysis, by affidavit, of the
fortunes of Philip Wirth, circus pro-
prietor, was the feature of a motion
regarding' permanent alimony
brought in the Divorce Court yester-
day by Sarah Jane Wirth.
In the affidavit, petitioner said her I
husband, from w r hom she secured a j
judicial separation last year on the I
ground of adultery with Alice Maude
Willis, derived a net annual income
of £lO,OOO or thereabouts from his
circus.
“My husband also has a large num-
ber of shares in the Hippodrome in
Sydney and the Olympia in Mel- !
bourne, which yielded large annual
\ dividends. He is also interested in
Wirth’s Skating Rink at Melbourne j
and the Saucer Track in Melbourne.
He also owns Towes Flats at St.
Kilda.”
Having said that respondent secured
large annual rentals from “certain
large and valuable properties,” wit-
ness continued, “As far as 1 know, he
owns various properties, consisting of
‘Louisa A T illa,’ in Sydney (Redfern);
'.‘Dudley Villa,’ Redfern; ‘Ocean View.’
•Coogee; and three shops in George
1 Street near Marcus Clarke's. He also
j has an hotel not far from Adelaide,
j which he is supposed to have pur- j.
! chased for the mother of Miss Willis,
' as well as a farm which he has pur-
chased with his brother for one Mrs.
Northy for her life. There is also
other property in Adelaide and Bris-
ibane.
“SHOULD BE £4 A WEEK”
Affidavits on behalf of respondent
said that the agreement entered into
between the parties provided that “in
case the petitioner should at any time
threaten to take any proceedings
against the respondent for mainten-
ance or divorce or restitution of con-
jugal rights or otherwise for compell-
ing him ot co-habit with her,’ then
the annuity of £312 a year should be
reduced by £lOO for ever such breach.
The original action was for divorce
and, the affidavits said, the respondent
had agreed to the payment of £lO a
week as alimony, pending a decision,
only on the assui'ance that the petition
would be proceeded with.
ORDER FOR INVESTIGATION
“It appears to have been the law in
| England for .very many years,”
said His Honour, “and is un-
questionably the law' here, that in
the case of dissolution of marriage the
whole of the financial circumstances
of the parties may be inquired into
and the Court, if it thinks fit, may set
aside or alter a deed of separation.
He could not see that the same right
did not exist in respect to a decree
of judicial separation and therefore he
made- an order referring the matter to
the Registrar Jor inquiry and report
on the means of the parties. The ques-
tion of alimony would stand over un-
til the report was completed.”
Mr. Hinton, instructed by Mr. H. E.
Mclntosh, appeared for petitioner, and
Mr. Alec. Thompson and W. Kidston,
instructed by Messrs. Stephen, Jacques
and Stephen, for respondent.
NOT A WIRTH
Mrs. Jennie Wirth writes: —
In your issue of January 5 (Friday)
you published a picture portraying
“Australians in the forefront.” “May
Vvirth, world’s champion lady rider,
riding ‘King Jess,’ a 15,000-dollar Hol-
stein.” Also adding, “Miss Wirth is a
daughter of the circus family.”
The lady calling herself Miss May
Wirth is no connection or relation of
the Wirths. Her father was a man
known as “Zinjar,” and Mrs. Martin
(nee Miss Marizles Wirth, sister of'
Wirth Bros.)' took her as an appren-
tice. She is now a Mrs. Frank White,
! having married recently in America
the one-time drummer of Wirih’s Cir-
cus.
In the whole of the Wirth family
there is only one daughter —Mrs.
I Blackmore (nee Miss Phyllis Wirth,
dancer and equestrienne), and only
daughter of Phillip Wirth, circus pro-
prietor of Wirth’s Circus.
-Tis said that Australian-born Maj j
Martin Wirth recently refused l,00(»j
dollars weekly to play in vaudeville j
in America, yet this brilliant perfor-
mer is credited with having left
Wirth Bros. * ring one night during ler
Melbourne season, without getting on j

“take a risk” in other countries.

Sensation at Circus
MONDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1922.
Huge Tent Collapses
Remarkable Escapes
Minor Casualties
A sensation of a most unusual char-
acter was provided at Wirth’s Circus,
which appeared near the La stern
liaths cm Saturday night a 1 ernlie
-■ale of wind causing the absolute col-
lapse of the huge canvas tent in which
a performance was being given.
Remarkable to relate nobody was
killed, and, as far as can *>e 'ascertain-'
od, no* serious injury was sustained by
any of the thousands of people wlio
were interestedly watching the pro-
ceedings when the collapse came. Quite
a score or more received nasty cuts-
aud bruises, others were tsruek by
falling timers, and many were drag-
ged out of their seats by the canvas a**
tlie wind swept it along. That the re-
sult was not much mote disastrous 19
almost miraculous.
STRONG WIND SPRINGS UP.
A strong intermittent wind sprang
up about hall-past 8, and the sides of
the tent swayed with it, but no appre-
hension was felt. An hour later the
wind increased in force, and carried
with it dense clouds of dust, which
blew into tile arena, and made things
somewhat uncomfortable. Stilt tlu*
| audience did not manifest any signs of,
| fear and continued to watch with
keen interest the particularly clever
balancing achievements of Evans and'
Perez. 1
It was at tins stage that the first
evidences of alarm were displayed. A
sudden burst of wind shook the tent,
and the canvas dapped! with a loud re-
port. Then thetre was an ominous
sag in the top of the tent, which dip-
ped two or three feet, the electric
light which brilliantly illuminated the
ring lowering simultaneously. A
particularly dense cloud of dust blew
through the tent immediately after-
wards. and fora some seconds it ogseur-
ed a clear view of what was transpir-
ing. This was quite enough for some
of the more timorous spirits—who
eventually proved to be the more pru- \
dent —and they hastily left their seats’
in various parts of the arena, and
made for the exit.
STAMPEDE AVERTED.
All the dements to cause a. stampede
were present, but a timely call from
one of the men attached to the) circus
that tliiere was no need for 1 alarm, ac-
companied by advise to! resume seat*,
had a reassuring effect, and any dan-
ger of a panic-stricken rush was soon
over. Most of those who had risen to
their feet sat down again, and others
who had partly made their way to
the escape door retraced their steps
with the intention of seeing the per-
formance through. A few. however,)
ted had ■ quite, enough, and quickly!
mado their way out. Meanwhile the!
canvas had been drawn taut again, the
lights had been lifted to their orginial
position, and the usual routine of th*
circus was proceeded with. By tbi»
time it was about a quarter to 10
o’clock. Alfred Clarke had just com-
pleted a .juggling on horseback turn,
in which hie introduced some navel and
attractive feats of expert, equitation
and acrobatic horsemanship, and Sliss
Isabal Polo was abotut due for her
hurricane hurdle act. As she gave
her contribution to the programme
scores of people unostentatiously slip-
ped out of the tent, the majority of
them dropping between the seats or
ever the back of them to the ground,
and then getting under the side of the
tent A few' adopted a more dignified'
way of retiring in the orthodox man-
ner. Miss Polo ted finished her work,
nnd the audience were expecting the
next artist when th© disaster happen-
ed.
SU DDES COLLAPSE
With cyclonic fore© tho wind rose!
again, and tho gigantic tent diook
and flapped and strained at the guy
ropes. Then a. massive tnanilla rope!
snapped like a thread of cotton, and I
tlio tension on other ropes was in-
creased. They proved unequal to the
fore© exerted upon them. What th*»
pressure on them was cannot he esti-
mated, hut that it must have heo»
enormous may 'well ho imagined when,
tho huge area of canvas is taken into
consideration, coupled with the fact
that the wind had then (according to
an official registration taken at about,
that time by Mr John Brittain,
F.R.A.S., at the Mount Pleasant Ob-
servatory), reached what, for Ballarat,
hi the abnormally high velocity of tiU
miles an hour. There was a loud re-
port as other ropes yielded, and the
western side of t.hie tent lifted in the
air. just as if a mammoth umbrella
was being opened up, and before the
audience:" had really appreciated the
situation the tent was floating. The
sides dragged over the: western tiers of
seats, dragging nut some of the occu-
pants, who were thrown against the
row m front of them. Men and
women had their hats torn from their
beads), scarves and overcoats were
wrenched away, and even spectacles
were dragged off, and hair ornaments
pulled cut of ladies’ hair. Ive an in-
conceivably brief space of time the
flapping side of the tent Had swept
over the spacious arena, and then
dropped like a: huge pall over the east-
ern tiers of seats. Substantial sup-
ports which .carped! the: weignt of the-
tent crashed to the ground, but for-
tunately the tangle of ropes and can-
vas served to retard their fall. To add
to the: confusion. the brilliant illu-
mination gave place to darkness, for
the inside electric light automatically
was extinguished. Meanwhile two or
three thousand people who were in the
eastern side otf the house: were endear
voring ,to release themselves, their task
being made the more difficult by the en-
veloping canvas, pulling and tugging
with every gust of wind 1 .
A STUNNED AUDIENCE.
There was nothing like the uproar
which might naturally have been ex-
pected. There were some loud cries
from all parts, but thei big majority of
the audience seemed too stunned and
strip!fied to make any great clamor.
Cries of “Keep your seats” and ‘‘Don’t
move” appeared to steady/ the people*
who were beginning to stampede from
the western side of the house. The
loose collapsible chairs were swiftly
and unceremoniously swung aside, and!
their former occupants slipped be-
tween the wooden supports to the
ground. rushed towards thei
centre of the arena, or helped ladies
over the back of the gallery to men
ivl*o wei> standing outside. Many
■i' omen and children were thus re-
moved .
On the eastern side there was no,
chance for a stampede, for the people I
there had been swept into: a struggling, |
wriggling mass, which feverishly but j
liiipoteatly clutdhed &t the imprisoning
canvas. '
ORDER.
Tlie circus attendants quickly pro-
duced hand lamps and set to work to
iVlease those who wore under the can-
vas. Hundreds had little difficulty in
treeing themselves, but others, par-
ticularly those who were in the front
ol the house on the eastern side, were
not so fortunate. Their movements
were hampered by hopes and timber*
and canvas, but gradually they f-njerg-
ed. In a remarkably short period,
taking everything into consideration,
everybody, teas got out. Strong elec-
tric lights wo ho turned oh to tile scene
of the wreckage, arid an opportunity
was afforded of realising what was the
extent of injury to individuals and
damage to property.
'\\ little to the left of the main
entrance a heavy timber had fallen
right across the stout planking which
was utilised for seating purposes, the
supports gave way, l and a number or
the timbers were splintered, and m a
trice 20 or 30 people were toppled
through to the ground, wondering
what had happened. The timber m its
fall caught an elderly lady a glancing
blow on the shoulder, and went with
a thud between her and her neighbor.
Two or three inches more to the ’ left
arid she would have received the full
force of the blow'. It was in this lo-
cality that the majority of those who
were injured—none of them seriously—
received then’ hurts.
NUMEROUS INJURIES.
A young lady in a white dress which
was bespattered with blood, appeared
to he nastilv cut, but it soon became
evident that most of the blood had
streamed from the gashed hand of 1 a,
man who was sitting behind her, ana
bad toppled over with her when the
seating collapsed. One man had a
cut 'to the bone over liis eye, caused
by his having come in contact with one
of the jagged ends of *a splintered
plank. Another narrowly escaped a
broken nose, • big red weal showing
across the nose and cheek. A school-
boy had his eyebrow split open. A
young lady was caught by the bead be-
tween two pieces of timber. She was
released with her face scratched and
her hair hanging down. Fifteen to
20 people in this one spot received cuts
and bruises.
Nearer the entrance another timber
came down. Right in its ray was a
young married lady, who was present
with "her husband: ft struck her on
the top ot the head, and sent lief reel-
ing to the ground, and as she lell her
knee and hip came in contact wit a pegs
in the ground. She Was assisted to
her feet by her husband and taken to
a doctor, who found that she had sus
.tamed slight concussion of the brain,
while there was a lump th-o size of an
egg on the top of her head. Her
knee was badly bruised. In the melee
she had lost her hah' comb, her hat, her
scarf, and her wallet. Several chil-
dren were squeezed during the crush
which ensued, and some of them were
separated from their .parents; but were
afterwards found,* crying, but little the
worse for their sensational and unique
experience.
One mau had a. remarkable escape.
As he fell tbs broken end of a plank
caught his watch chain, hist mfissing
penetrating his chest. Ibe chain
snapped, and the watch went flying out
amongst tire crowd. t
Meanwhile the attendanto were e»-j
deavoring to gain some idea as to u hat

Portion of the tent was rolled back,
and it was found that several ladies
had fainted. These were .canned out,
and so bn recovered. ' Others were in

CLEARING THE RING.
‘“Everybody out of the ring, was
tile order that went round as soon as it
was ascertained that the consequences,
compared with what might have been,
were virtually trifling. But the people
or a great many of them, were slow
;to obey the direction. Some were oou-
-1 suuied with curiority to learn whether
anybody had been killed,, and all sorts
of rumors' were 'circulated, the sight
of women being helped out causing a
report that somebody had been I‘atafly
injured. F'ortuantely the report was
without foundation. It was also said
that one of the elephants had been
struck and killed. That also was in-
correct, for the lour animals now oC*|
companying the circus were to be seen
yesterday morning near the baths'
fence quietly eating their breakfast ol
hay, wrenching off the heads of gram
and discarding a good deaf of the
straw. Others were anxious to see if
those who had accompanied them to
the performance had escaped harm. But
there was a third section—-and not a
small one—which was busying itself 'in
search for missing property. And
it was astonishing to find how miscel-
laneous that property was.
ELEAIENT OF HUMOR.
As soon as the newa of the accident
spread further police hurried to the
scene, and proceeded to restore order,
wlulc the ring-master, Mr J. W. Cook,
directed his staff to collect whatever
property could be retrieved. Tips was
no easy matter, for many of the articles
were mixed up with the wfteCkage, and
it took some little time to clear it up
sufficiently to gather in the stuff.
The atmosphere of tragedy soon gave
| place to one of amusement, duo to the
frantic efforts of Some people to find;
hats and overcoats 1 and scarvcj*. At
least 2-50 men had lost their hats. In
some instances it had fallen ay, they
attempted to avoid the oqcoming can-
vas, for a. good many on the eastern
side had time io jump down behind the
seats before it swopped; upon them. But
the vast majority had lost their- head-
gear when the tent inexorably had
descended upon them. In the crowd
were 15 to 20 women who were hatless,
a fid they, too, clamored for their pos-
sessions.
\ .‘‘Have you seen a new black velour
i hat?” called oat one well-known citi-
| zen. Instantly a child’s cap was thrust
I* into his hand, only to be promptly re-
ll jeeted. “Is this it?” called' out an
ij attendant, as he handed across a brown
felt which was several sizes too large.
The onlookers laughed 1 , and so- did the
man and the attendant. That was
the start of the relief, and in a few
minutes all thoughts of the danger
of the alarming occurrence seemed to
have been swept out of mind. Laugh
after laugh arose as men tried on an
shapes and colors and 1 sizes of hats.
Some were fortunate in quickly be-
ing suited, but others wander-
ed from consfbable to constable
standing with arms full of hats,
wraps, scarves, and overcoats —or stop-
ped the quick!v moving circus em
ployes with the constant query,
you seen my hat ?” (Somewhat timid-
ly the women joined in the quest.
‘‘Have yoiti a large check scarf?” ques*
tioned one. A large check scarf was
produced, but it was the wrong color.
‘‘My wallet is missing,” said another.
A third asked for a black silk wrap, %
fourth wanted a hair ornament, aju*-
other had lost a large white hat with
red fiolwers in it. And so the ques-
tions* were fired at the perplexed and
worried attendants. Several hoys
pushed their way forward. ‘‘Say,
mister, have you seen my cap?” wero
the first words their leader addressed
to. Mr Cook. The cap had not been
seen:.
An hour had elapsed by this time,
and enquiries were then directed to
the “office,” which was the van from
which tickets had been sold three
hours earlier. In the office werei piled
all manner of hats and! other articles.
More serious than the loss of a hat to
some pedple was the loss of spectacles.
The fact that spectacles had been
dragged off was an indication of how'
some of the crowd had been! pulled
about. One man who liad arrived!
from Melbourne during the afternoon
with the intention of enjoying his
Christmas holidays in Ballarat was
giving expression to his wonderment
as to how he was to fare witlwut his.
glasses.
Gradually the pile diminished, but
at the last there were claimants: for
things which had not been recovered,
and things for which there were n»
claimants. Finally it was announced
that the “office” would be opened yes-
terday morning, when further opDov-
tunty for securing property would b«
given.
THE INJURED PEOPLE.
While this humorous business was
proceeding those who had sustained
hurts went away most of them to
have home .treatment, others to he at-
tended to by the family doctor. Five
of the injured went to the hospital,
where two were admitted, while three
were treated and then taken home.
The hospital cases were: —

SENBATIONAL INCIDKNTS.
Soane sensational experiences wire
related when some semblance of order
had been restored.
A lady who had been sitting in the
eastern side of tile house said:— 1 !
was looking towards the opening in
the tent where, the performers were go-
ing out, when I heard a loud noise
coining from, the opposite sMe. Ihe
next thing I remember was that I wa-
out in the'' road with my husband. 1

man’s hat on my head. There were
half a dozen men standing near with-
out a hat, and I asked them if the one
I had belonged to them. Huy all

to a policeman, and I went liome.

ber struck his mate, who was sitting
next to him, and fractured his collar-

tor was one of the prudent ones, who
retired after the first excitement was

With daylight yesterday morning
IVirth’e staff was at work. The huge
spread of canvas was folded back, in-

Enquiries at the Hospital last night
brought the information that the two
children who had been admitted were
not seriously hurt.. The lady who had
sustained slight concussion of the
brain was much, better and had been

Wife of Three Millionaires
CHARGES AGAINST STAGE STAR
Temperamental Peggy Hopkins
Mr. J. S. Joyce, a multi-millionaire
lumberman, and third husband of Peggy
Hopkins, who is known as America’s
most temperamental stage star, has
started a suit for. the annulment of his
marriage. He also demands the return
o' £ 125,000 in money and property which
he has given to his wife since thqjr mar-
riage on January 23„ 1920.
Peggy Hopkins, who is- 27 years ot
age, has married three millionaires in ten
years.* Her first husband was Everett
Archer, one of the wealthiest residents
of Denver. Peggy Hopkins was then 17
years old. Six months afterwards she
and her husband parted.
Her second matrimonial venture took
place at the age of 19, when she eloped
with Sherburne Hopkins, junr., legal rep-
v-s-eitative of most of the great mining
and oil interests in Mexico. Peggy left
him in 191 o, saying that millionaires were
■ horrid things, all wrapped up in cou-
pons.” She went on the stage, and ap-
peared in A Sleepless Night,” “It Pays
i , Flirt,” and similar productions. She
was also a film star, au artists’ model,
and a dress model.
site then married Air. Joyce, and went
to Europe for the honeymoon. Mr. Joyce
returned alone, and inserted notices in
the newspapers saying that he would not

Joyce now declares that Peggy was still
married to Mr. Hopkins when she mar-
ried him. and hence his marriage should

wit lx ■ intimacy with many men in Ame-
rica. England, and France. She is ac-
cused of misbehaviour at Torquay in June
Mid .July, 1920. and a Pullman car epi-
sode in a train at Venice is cited.
Mr. Joyce asserts that other incidents
occurred at various places in Europe in
Julv, August, September, and October,

The Mighty Atom
How Mimi Juggles Men
“Ah, Mimi!”
Imagine a sigh here, for the eternal
deception of women and of this one in
particular—this Mimi Wharton.
A WISP IX WHITE
In the big arena at Wirth’s circus
she stands, dainty as Dresden china
in her abbreviated white dress; seven i
stone nothing, a wisp of a girl whose
beguiling is like Delilah's and whose
strength is as Samson’s. A novelist
would say she was the sort of girl who
needed a strong man to guard her.
Hundreds of sentimental idicts in the
circus audience would like the job.
But it’s all deception. So far from
clinging' like the ivy, this bit of a
girl could take you and, with a sudden
tension of slender wrist and the nex
of a childish elbow, swing you over
her head—and keep you there.
MIMI
She is Belgian. It is a pity that
in 1914 they did not launch her upon
Von Bissing. She could have thrown
him out of Belgium, child as she was
—a fearsome prodigy!
When she was a baby she was always
hankering “to be strong.” Perhaps
she'd read of the infant Hercules who
strangled serpents in his cradle! At
any rate she was giving a “strong-
child” act when she was seven and
made London w r onder if she was real.
REPULSED
In a world of rough men it is good
to be strong. There was once in Paris
a gentleman of Montmatre who
was too pressing in his at-
tentions and could not take . a
hint —a very persistent gentleman in-
deed. A compliment of course, but
Ala demoiselle Mimi does not like com-
pliments that are so pointed, she put
him out of action with a turn of the
wrist. . _ .
Then there was the gladiator m Bel-
gium. Mimi makes expressive gesture
with dainty hands to indicate the
grossness— oh. but he was of a gross-
ness inexpressible. Figure to your-
sehes this so large and heavy man
scoffing at the strength of Madain-
oiselle. _, , ...
A wager is laid that Mademoiselle
cannot lift the gross one and the whole
troupe comes to see the trial. Lattle
hands are clasped in the hairy paws
of the gladiator; the little body which
appears so frail is braced, and, pouf!
like-a rose-leaf up goes the man of
grossness incredible. baore horn dun
chien! She has done it, la p’tite!
THE VITAL SPARK
Merrily she goes through the world,
happy at eighteen as at se\en, hei
feet restless while the others perform,
her eager face alight and her eyes
sparkling. The moment comes, and
an eleven stone man is held up on her
hands, balances himself on her shoul-
der and unflurried and unhurried
Madamoiselle with exquisite grace
makes the “top man” look like a
featherweight. With a laugh she jug-
gles with him and sets him down, then
she shakes her mane of hair—kisses
her hands and darts off. Ah, Mimi!
Wee Georgie Wood’s
Appreciation.
On the eve of his departure from Syd-
ney, Wee Georgie Wood, the English
vaudeville star, made several valuable
presentations to many of those people
who had shown him every consideration
during his season at Sydney Tivoli.
Amongst those favored by Mr. W ood
were .Tames Kendall, manager of the
Tivoli, Archie Martin, chief of pub-
licity; .Tack Grant, stage manager: \\ ill
Quintrell, orchestra leader; Mr. O Don-
aghue, and several others.
This kindly consideration so prac-
tically evinced by Wee Georgie was
highly honored by the recipients, as it
was some time ere any visiting star has
given such a demonstration of his ap-
preciation.
ELEPHANTS’ PRANKS
FOUR BREAK FROM CIRCUS
INDIAN PERFORMER TEARS
UP PEPPER TREE
Lawn Littered With Debris
Early this morning four of the ele-
phants attached to Wirths’ Circus seem
to have heard the call of the jungle,
and done their best to answer it.
Cardie, Princess, Alice and Molly
snapped the heavy leg chains that held
them captive in the yard a't the rear
of the circus, reduced a drag to frag-
ments,' and finally thrust their huge
bodies through a panel of a galvanised
iron fence, and made off in the dark-
ness.
Of the subsequent doings of Prin-
cess, Alice, and Molly, there is little
to be said. They evidently did not
have the wit to make the most o
their dying start for freedom, as the
tii" were quickly found in the vicinity
cf the Olympia by the agitated train-
er. v. he. in res jor.se to an alarm
raised by the watchman, had beg: n
a search for his charges. They were
docile enough when he approached_,
and were led back to the dingy yard
and again fettered without any
trouble.
CARPI AT THE PORT
Cardi, the Indian male, who turns
the scale at about four tons, had, how-
ever, ranged further afield in search
of a jungle, and eventually found what
pleased him in the back garden of the
house of Mr. M. Rabinov, of Crock-
ford street, Port Melbourne, At the
rear of Mr. Rabinov’s property is a
vacant allotment, fronting Carton
street, and across this patch of swmid
lumbered Cardi until he came to a
palmg fence. By way of a prelim-
inary he coiled his trunk round a
great bough of a pepper tree which
projected over the fence, and broke
it off as a child would snap a biscuit.
A gentle thrust of his head made a
ten-foot gap in the fence itself, and
the way was open for his ponderous
pranks. . .
On every hand his spirit of mis-
chief found scope. A pepper tree
with a 15-inch bole was torn out by
the roots and throwm against a side
fence; a sturdy Cyprus by the house
was laid prone. Here an apricot tree
was stripped of half its branches, theie
a cherry tree avas rudely reduced to
small pieces; a vine-covered trellis was
torn down, and the lawn littered with
twigs and leaves as Cardie pursued his
delightful pastime. Curiously enoughj
a young lemon tree seems to ha\ e
been avoided by him, as amid the
wreckage it stood today with e\eiy
leaf intact.
household aroused
While all the turmoil was going on
Mr. Rabinov and his family slept
soundly, but a neighbor who arose
early to catch a country tram saw
the animal moving about in the cool
of the dawn, and arousea Mr. Rao-
iinov, who hurried into his yard anajj
i peremptorily ordered Cardie off the |
premises. The elephant thoughtfully j
(regarded him for a few moments,
[ and then lumbered out by the way he
had entered. Crossing the vacarit al-
lotment to the Methodist Church, he
I put his head over the fence, and ap-
parently not finding the view inviting,
he returned again to his now con-
siderably devastated bit of j_ungle, and
|refused to be*> shooed off.
The anxiety of the Rabinov house-
hold was soon afterwards relieved,
however, by the arrival of the trainer.
When he approached with his familiar
ear-hook the elephant quietly submit-
ted to his control, and was led away
without further incident.
HEAVIER CHAINS NEEDED
Mr George Anderson, general man-
lager for Wirth Brothers, explained to-
tlay that the breaking of the holding
chains bv the elephants came as a
great surprise, as they were of a very
strong type, and in general use for
tethering elephants. fin view of what
had happened, however, much heavier
chains would be procured today, and a
repetition of Cardie’s escapade prevent-
ed. - , -
“THE LAST CALL”
Death of Villiers Arnold
Mr. George Villiers Arnold, well
known throughout Australia as one of
the cleverest character actors, died yes-
terday at a private nursing home after
a comparatively short illness from
pleurisy and pneumonia.
Mr. Arnold, whose baritone voice had
given pleasure to thousands of music
lovers throughout Australia, had re-
cently been appearing at the Grand
Opera House as the Gobbler in “Chu
Chin Chow,” his artistic rendition of
the “Cobbler’s Song” in the third act
being one of the features of the pro-
duction. Mr. Arnold came to Australia
in 1914 with the Gilbert and Sullivan
Opera Company, and was induced to
extend his contract until the present
date. His experience in England was
mostly gained with the D’Oyley Carte
Opera Company. While in Australia
Mr. Arnold married Miss Pearl Ladd,
also a Gilbert and Sullivan artist, who
survives , him.
Dean Talbot has arranged to conduct
a funeral service at St. Andrew’s
Cathedral at 10.16 a.m. on Monday.
“QLD-TIMER” (Pennant Hills, Syd-
ney) encloses the following para-
graph from “The Sydney Sun”
“Poincaire, the mimic at the Grand
Opera House, is Marie La Varre’s
father. She has also a brother on the
stage, and her mother was a clever Eng-
lish show-woman, appearing with a big
cockatoo as Madame Marvelle. Re-
cently the family was presented on the
bills of four Sydney theatres.”
“Old-timer” continues: —
“It is a tribute to Poincaire’s ver-
satility that he has remained so long
in Australia. He has been here since
he was brought out, I think, by A. E.
Martin at the end of 1912 or begin-
ning of 1913. At any rate I saw him
in April, 1913, at what to-day is Fullers’
Theatre (Sydney).
“At that time he was known as Fritz

voice’). Madame Marvelle with her
cockatoos was in the same bill. ‘Henry
Abdy and his mind-reading dog, Mick,’
represented a third act in the pro-
gramme for which the family were
responsible.
“Poincaire—to stick to that name-
told me then that he was in Australia
forty years previously. He showed me
a photograph in which he looked a
grey-haired old man. ‘lt was taken,
he said, ‘twenty years ago. The doctors
assured me that there was no hope of
my living beyond a certain date. But
I struggled mentally against the com-
plaint from which I was suuffering.
The result was that I pulled through—
so much so that even to-day I never
felt better in my life.’
“Poincaire is a marvel for his age.
For the impression I got from him at
that time was that he must now be
approaching the 75-mark.
“Many besides myself will be inter-
ested to hear that Marie Le Varre is
his daughter.”
First are “The Five Wartons, a
little troupe of acrobats which has
been in existence for eighteen years.
They have introduced a peculiar
type of see-saw-like spring-board
( which enables them to bring double
or triple somersaults to a fine art.
| From this they have evolved a tru-
ily wonderful feat. It may be of in-
terest to note, in parentheses, that
they perform in neat riding kits, with
leather gaiters and stiff linen col-
lars—an outfit which, though un-
doubtedly smart in appearance, is
hardly one which most of us would
choose for the performance of such
a feat as the following.
One of the men stands on the
right-hand end of a board,
w'hilst behind him, at a dis-
tance of about eight feet, two
other members of the troupe,
the one mounted on the shoulders
of the other, are balancing
a padded chair ready to catch him.
On the word “Go” the man seen
on the extreme left of the group,
who has been standing on the
pedestal, jumps from it on to the
spring-board, the impetus of which
throws the other man into the air
like a stone from a catapult. With
his knees clasped the latter turns i
neat double somersault, arriving
in the chair with considerable force.
It is, in fact, difficult to understand
"now the men who catch him manage
io maintain their balance.
In conversation with Mr. Warton,
the leader of the troupe, who is seen
holding the chair, the writer learned
that this feat took several years to
perfect. “Since then, said Mr. War-
ton, “other performers have paid
us the doubtful compliment of imi-
tation; although I have not yet seen
anybody else playing this sort ot
catch-ball with a full-grown man.
“Accidents? Yes, sometimes; but
they are usually the result of sheer
carelessness. When presenting our
most difficult trick we are all of us
on the alert, and an accident is rari_,
but it is in the simpler tricks, which
have become so mechanical through
repetition, that we sometimes find
our minds wandering. Then, before
we know where we are, there is a
a sprained wrist or a broken collar-
bone. The chair trick which you
have illustrated is very difficult be-
cause the man who performs the
somersault never comes twice in the
same direction. My partner and I
often have to move very quickly
backwards, forwards, or sideways,
to catch him.”


Sensational Motor Accident
Car Drops into Coomera River
YOUNG LADY HAS NARROW ESCAPE
A rather sensational incident
occurred recently when a large
touring motor car containing a
party of men and women fell
from the vehicle punt which
plies on the Coomera River,
WALTER CORNOCK.
on the road between Brisbane and
Southport, and sank in deep Avater.
At the time of the accident, the
car, which was a Halley vehicle,
22ft. in length, was crossing the
ferry. Its occupants were nine
members of the Scarlet Runners
Entertainment Company, who use
the car in their travels from town
to town, and were proceeding from
Southport to Beaudesert.
The punt had reached the Bris-
bane side of the river, and as the
car was moving off the ferry chain,
which is alleged to haA r e been much
worn, broke, and the punt moved
out toward mid-stream. Just at the
time that the chains of the punt
gave way the motor car was started,
and before anything could be done
to avert a disaster, the vehicle,
Avhich, in addition to the party, car-
ried five tons of theatrical scenery
and properties, plunged into the
river. Realising that an accident
was unavoidable, Mr. L. W. Abel,
treasurer of the company, told the
members of the party to jump out
of the car. All were successful in
getting clear, excepting Miss Coutts
Du Valli, who went with the car to
the bottom of the river, some 15 or
20 feet below the surface. Diving
operations to rescue the young lady
were at once begun, and after a
strenuous effort Mr. Abel succeeded
in extricating Miss Du Valli from
the car, and brought her to the sur-
face. Both Mr. Abel and the young
lady were very much exhausted,
the latter being in a half-drowned
state, but after the usual methods
of resuscitation had been resorted
to, she recovered.
The members of the party were
as follows:—Misses Coutts Du Valli,
Ethel Walker, and Bertha Bush,
Messrs. L. W. Abel, A. Sharpies,
A. Hunter (chauffeur), D. King, AV.
Cornock, and L. Brinkley (pianist).
On Saturday, as soon as possible,
after the accident, efforts were
made to recover the ear, and the
services of a bullock team were re-
quisitioned. A chain was at-
tached to the car, and after much
trouble the immersed vehicle was
raised to within a few yards of the
shore. The difficulty of the job
was increased by the steepness of
the incline to the river, which is a
terror to all motorists who travel
that route. The car cost a sum of
£l5OO, and had not been long i,n
use. It had seating capacity for
22 persons, and Mr. Abel has esti-
mated that the damage will amount
to the sum of £5OO.
TRAINING ANIMALS.
Mr. George Wirth', of Wirth Bros.'
Circus, Olympia, proposes in a few weeks
to open to the public fhe menagerie
school. It is claimed that all the animals*
are taught by kindness, and Mr. Wirth
. sl J es to ?ive the public an opportunity
tor judging for themselves. Pictures pub-
lished on this page show some of the <
monkeys being taught their tricks, the re--
•ward for a good performance being a plum
ot which fruit they are particularly fond. •'
The big attraction at Wirth’s Circus
this season is Apdale’s Performing
Zoo. At present, eight clogs (six beau-
! tiful white French poodles and two
! fox terriers), three baboons, three
Chinese bears (beautifully-coated
black monsters), and a South American
ant-eater comprise the zoo, of which
Air. Apdale is the director. When the'
animals are upon the stage in the ring
Mr. Apdale is' kept going for over half
an hour as the ringmaster of what is
really a circus within an already great
circus. The fun is not allowed to flag
for a moment. The poodles romp and
play; apparently there is a fight for
supremacy between the fox terriers
and the baboons. The bears ride tri-
cycles; the baboons actually perform
upon bicycles; the poodles act as
horses and drivers of trotting sulkies
and Roman chariots. The animals also
are all proficient rope-walkers. The
zoo was for many seasons a topline
act upon the Grpheum circuit in
America.
A regrettable accident occurred
on Thursday, when John Steven-
son, a professional stunt actor, was
killed while doubling for Pearl
White. The occurrence took place
under the elevated station at 72nd
Street and Columbus Avenue. Ste-
venson, dressed as Miss White had
to jump from the top of a bus,
seize a rope of pearls that were
suspended from a rail, and reach
the ground safely. A miscalcula-
tion somewhere or other sent him
diving headling to the ground.
Death followed several hours later.
The stunt was for inclusion in a
serial which Miss White is now
making at the 134th Street studio,
at which place I am going to spend
a day before I leave, watching Miss
White work.
Masonic Presentation to Georgie
Wood.
A most successful concert was held
at the Masonic Club on Monday, the
16th inst., when his Excellency, Sir
Walter Davidson and Dame Margaret
Davidson were present, attended by
Mr. G. F. Blandy and Miss Henderson.
Bro. ,T. P. Ivess (musical director)
welcomed them on behalf of the club,
and congratulated Sir Walter on his
extended term of office and expressed
fhe pleasure of the members on the fact
that his son had been elected Wor.
Master of his lodge. By permission of
Bro. Harry G. Musgrove, of the Tivoli
Theatre, Bro. Burr and Miss Daphne
Hope and Wee Georgie AVood took part
and at the conclusion of Bro. Wood’s
turn, his Excellency made a presentation
to the latter of a life member’s gold
badge, and a gold brooch set with dia-
monds and rubies for his mother. Sir
Walter congratulated the club on the
magnificent concert, the success of
which was mainly due to the refined
items given by the artists from the
Tivoli Theatre, in consequence of the
generosity of Bro. Musgrove. Bro.
AVood replied, and thanked his Excel-
lency for making the presentation, and
caused great amusement by stating that
when leaving England he never antici-
pated being in the same cast as His
Excellency. A vote of thanks for His
Excellency was proposed by Right
Wor. Bro. Goulston, Deputy Grand
Master,
Dialogue of two patrons of Wirths’
Circus :—-
“What did you like best? The
elephants?”
“No ; not the elephants.”
“The acrobats?”
“No ; not the acrobats.”
“The performing animals?”
“No ; not the dogs and monkeys.”
“What then?”
“I’ll tell you. I liked the civility. It
started on the footpath outside, folloAved
us inside, and carried us outside again.
Wirths’ people seem gladder to see you
than any other people in the entertain-
ment business, and they take more
pains to please you. That’s what I liked
best.”
“I thought you said that if I were
sociable with the Judge I could" get off?”
“Were you?”
“Yes. I said, ‘G'ood morning, Judge;
how are vou to-day ?’ and he replied,
‘Fine —£5.’ ”
Con Colleano, the wire-walker on the
Tivoli circuit, is an Australian, whose
act would compare favorably Avith the
best act of its kind overseas. Some of
Con’s feats are almost unbelievable,
and, at the same time, both thrilling
and amazing.
THE CIRCUS
A GREAT SHOW.
IN A SEA OF Alt 0
liu. drawing power of the life and
paraphernalia of a circus was never
more amply demonstrated than it was
last night, when men and women, in-
lan/s m arms, young men and vouths.
girls and young ladies, made Wirths’
mammoth spread of canvas in the Main
ychooi grounds a gathering place for the
inspection of what the veteran circus
proprietors had brought from the ends
or the earth to show them. The circus
arrived at Timaru by special train from
ilie- south yesterday moiling, and all day
some portion of it was the cynosure of
all eyes within seeing distance. The
zoo., the best of its. kind which lias ever
travelled the world, was open between
4 and 5 o’clock in the afternoon, and
the show proper was tuned for 8 o’clock
last- night. Its magic had attracted
people from every district within a
radius' of fifty miles of Timaru, and it
wa an enormous crowd which sought
admittance to it. lint ranee to the
circus was off Urey Hoad, and by 7
o crock the street named was almost im-
passable owing to the congestion caused
i>y the crowd and the tong lines of
motor cars which “garaged" ‘on either
aide of it, while their occupants went
to the scene of the night’s attraction,
rain came down in sheets, but it
■emeci utter .y powerless to damp the
*douv of the signtseers, hundreds of
■iom were vet through before they
passed through the entrance door.
Th© crowfl got all they paid for and
a great deal more than, taey oargained
for, as' t so hanpeneii that tljere. were]
two shows, and tne one which was not
on the programme was as amusing and
entertaining, in its w. , as the real
one. The wncxpeetcu uu.v was unique
in the history of the town, and was pro-
vided by the people themselves, ity
■i use being the vile weather which pre-
pailed. The deluge of rain soaked the
ft*ig circus tent, and as the rain dripped
through it ah round the enclosure was
soon sopping wet. People did not know
this till they were admitted, and just
when they expected to find a comfort-
able seat and a safe haven from the
riotous elements mey fouuu tmemselv es
face to face with a sea. of mud to wade
through in order to reach the seats,
which were far too wet to sit upon. At
first it was thought that when the can-
vas was thoroughly wet the rain would
cease to- drip through it, but the storm
was too fierce for this; and, pelting
mercilessly down, the rain came tnrough
and streamed on to the people as if to
wreak vengeance on them for leaving
their homes on such a. night. First it
ran in streamlets all about the end en-
ure, till the people, churning up the wet
ground by wa king over it to got to
their seats and in a vain search tor a
dry spot, blocked its free flow and
caused it to form miniature lagoons of
the consistency of pea soup, and soon
mud and water made shooting boots a
necessity, and the manager of the show
wisely put his knee boots on. It can
be imagined what fate befell high-heeled
shoes and silk stockings. Even men’s
ordinary heavy boots were quite un-
equal to keeping out the water and tile
slush. O nsidera.ble amusement was ex-
tracted from the sight when “sweet
sixteen” was seen in hundreds hopping
here, stuck in the mud there, and part-
ing company from a shoe which refused
to leave the hole into which it had been
sunk elsewhere; and cheers were given
when gal'ant young men sought to
make the way easier for dignified wadies
in hundred-guinea fur coats by carrying
them, sometimes in their arms and in
some cases on their backs. “It’s worse
than France,” the Diggers said;'and it
certainly was as bad as it well could be.
The usherd at first directed people to
their different-priced seats, but in the
scramble which ensued they had to give
this up, and people went where they
‘liked or wherever they could get. By
the time the opening strains of the
orchestra (an excellent one, by the way)
were heard a good many hundreds were
seen seated on the water-soaked and
muddy seats, but a great many pre-
ferred to stand all night. There was
some speculation as to whether thej cir-
cus would show under such circum-
stances, but the people were not long
left in doubt. The Wirths have been
to- long on the road to be stopped
by trifles of that sort, and they vent
right through the piece, the resource of
the management and the grit of the
performers reflecting the greatest credit
upon all concerned, for both in and cut-
side the tent and all about it the con-
ditions were favourable only to water
fowl.
As to the show, it must he said that
it isi the finest of its kind that has ever
been here. The animals were all seen
in the pink of condition, and were wed
worth going to see, even had there been
no performance. All very evidently re-
ceive the best possible attention. In the
ringfmany of the old acts were wit-
nes and a great many hew ones; |
*lhe lions, elephants, horses,
ponies, dogs, goats, geese, etc., all
giving “turns’ 5 .which elicited admira-
tion and warm demonstrations of ap-
proval. How the animals, stood np to
their work in a ring which was ppracti-
cally under water was the marvel of the
evening. The lions included one whose
high dill
Thev ■h'rowlfrdjjlhnd pshow-
ed their teeti*, and though
their keeper fondled and petted
them, there was a sigh of relief
iyvhen he got) them safely kennelled up
Rgain. The elephants, as usual, did
■good work, one being particularly good,
Eh at the most/ amusing performance was
chat for which a flock of geese was re-
sponsib'e, the birds going through some
military manoeuvres at the command of
Danny, the clown; and finally they re-
fused to leave the ring untif a goat-
drawn carriage was sent for them. In
this they established themselves com-
fortably, and drove off in state, to the
i : accompaniment of much squawking,
which was taken to mean satisfaction
| with their performance or regret at
j leaving the “pond” which they so much
j appreciated in the ring. A striking
l novelty, and one which came in for
much admiration, was the imitation
statuary, composed of grouped men in
white, a white horse, and white dogs.
They were seen in a variety of poses; in
each all were as still as death, and the
effect produced _ was remarkably fine.
It was an artistic and' very pleasing
item. As to the artists on the trapeze
and the wire rope, the acrobats who
seemed to have bodies without bones,
the girls who appeared in a pretty
butterfly ballet in mid air, the flying
Winskills, and others \who figured in*
feats of daring and full of skill, their re-
spective turns require to be been to he j
appreciated and believed. No account i
on paper could do them justice.
It is satisfactory to know that Wirths
have resumed their pre-war itinerary,
and that their great educational show
iff likely to visit Timaru on some future
occasion. It will he the wish of every-
one that when next they come here they
will be favoured by weather suitable, to
their big undertaking 1 .
A George Gee Song.
Ed. A. Wylie (Gayndah, Q.). —The
George Gee lines respecting which you
inquire have already appeared in these
pages.
The song begins:—
I’m feeling fearfully bucked with life,
By Gad, I am —by Gad!
I found a simply colossal girl—
The best I ever had.
She went away this afternoon
To awfully Maidenhead;
The train was packed, so I found the
guard,
Saluted him and said.
Then comes the chorus: —
How do you awfully do, old thing?—
I’m Clarence Frightfully Vere;
Will you do all you can and see old
man
To this young lady here?
The train started off, so we pushed
her in,
No time to see what class;
Then I gave her a shilling and kissed
the guard—
I did feel a dreadfully ah-ss!
Love’s Young Dream.
The petition of Sarah Jane Wirth for
a dissolution of her marriage with
Philip Wirth (Wirths’ Circus) was be-
fore the court in Sydney during the
month.
The ground was adultery—a charge
which the respondent did not deny.
Petitioner stated that her maiden
name was Hodgson, that they were
married at Parnell (N.Z.), and that
there were two children of the mar-
riage—Phyllis Marizles Martha and
John Henry. The girl was still living.
The boy died when three months old.
Both were born in Adelaide.
Petitioner went on to say that with
an inquiry agent, George W. Rennie,
she visited a house in Campbell-street,
Sydney, and that with a woman they
there met the following conversation
took place:—
Rennie: Are you the real Mrs. Wirth?
■—The woman: I am.
Rennie: Are you Mrs. Philip Wirth
alias Alice Maud Willis? —Yes.
Here petitioner interposed, “I am the
real Mrs. Philip Wirth”; and Rennie
handed Miss Willis —for we now get
to the correct name —the divorce
papers. (
A THEATRICAL HITCH-UP.
The engagement is announced of
j Sadie Maguire, of “The Lilac Domino”
Co., to Billy Elliott, the American black-
face star, now appearing at Fullers’
Theatre. The marriage, which is to fake
place in Sydney during the week, is the
outcome of an interesting romance dat-
ing back to the time when Mr. Elliott
first arrived from America to appear at
the Tivoli in “Buzz-Buzz” and other pro-
ductions. Miss Maguire was one of the
Tivoli beauties at the time, and was
actually the first Australian girl with
whom ‘ Mr. Elliott became acquainted.
The happy friendship that s-prang up
led on to courtship and engagement.—•

Wee Georgie Wood finished his season
five days earlier than expected in order
to play a special fortnight's return in
Melbourne. The change in arrange-
ments will necessitate the little chap
returning to London via Suez, and fore-
going his trip through Honolulu, to
which he had looked forward with plea-
surable anticipation. Wee Georgie's
send-off on October 19, at the Tivoli,
was a wonderful tribute to a great

With an aggregate weight of two tons five, hundredweight, the All Blacks
are crossing the Tasman to meet N.S.W. in a series of test matches prior
to a tour of Great Britain. It is a youthful team, the youngest members
being G. Nepia, W. H. Brown, and L. Paewai, 19 years of age, and the
elders, A. H. West and A. White, who are 30. The team meets the
N.S.W. Rugby Union stars on July 5.
RUGBY UNION FOOTBALL
EVE OF THE TEST MATCH
IN NEW ZEALAND
L By RAMBLER)
All Rugby Union interest is centred
in doings across the Tasman. The de-
feat of the All Blacks came as a sur-
prise to most of those who had seen
the South Africans in action in Syd-
ney. When the New Zealand team was
over here last year it was not con
sidered up to the standard of its pre-
decessors, e»d the success of the Spring-
boks, coupled with the triumphs of the
New South Wales team, is convincing
evidence that the game in New Zea-
land has not recovered from the effects
of the war.
TEST MATCH AT CHRISTCHURCH.
To-morrow the N.S.W. team will
tackle the stiffest task of the tour —the
Test match at Christchurch. It was at
this city that N.S.W. gained their only
victory on New Zealand soil in 1894.
The general belief in Sydney is that they
will be successful in the coming game,
especially if the three-quarter line is
sound —that is, if the injured players
have recovered, or the two reinforce-
ments —Raymond and Shute —have not
been affected by the trip across.
SPRINGBOKS MAY PLAY HERE AGAIN.
There is a desire in Rugby Union
circles in Sydney to see the triumphant
tourists in action against the next best
on their return. Though the weather
will will be a bit sultry for Rugger, it
should “ draw fairly well if well
organised—something different from the
first round of the knock-out competition*
when people were fooled. It is also
officially stated that there is still a
possibility of the Springboks playing
again in Sydney. After the success oj. J
N.S.W. since they faced them last, such y
a match should be attractive. 1
"THE” ALL BLACKS.
A numbers of the famous wearers of
the Silver Fern o-f 1905 foregathered
at Dunedin for the first Test against
the Springboks. W. T. Glenn, who was
in Sydney playing with Wallaroo in,
1899, and who is now M.P. for Rangi-
tikeh invited them to a supper on the
evening of the game. Those present
(says Touchline in the N.Z. Free Lance)
were Billy Wallace, George Nichol-
son, J. W. Stead, Alex McDonald,
Steve Casey, Jimmy Duncan, and
the host. General Booth saw t.i©
match but was compelled to return to
Invercargill before the function. Of the
remainder of the great band, D. Gallaher
and E. Harper were killed in action, R.
Dean died soon after the return of the
team, and W. Mackrell passed away a
few years ago. Corbett and Newton
have not been heard of recently. George
Smith and Seeling are in England, but i
the rest are scattered over the Dominion.
N.S. WALES TEAM IN N.Z.
MARLBOROUGH BEATEN 19 TO 11.
The N.S.W. Rugby team defeated Marl-
borough by 19 to 11, after a good display
of Rugger, on Wednesday last Tries
were obtained by Wallace, Stanley (2),
and M’Kay. Mingay converted two and
kicked a penalty. Marlborough scored
three tries, one being converted, Mingay
has scored thirteen goals in fifteen at-
tempts. BULLER DEFEATED.
At Westport on Saturday New South
Wales defeated Buller by 25 to 11. It
was a fast and open game. At half-
time Buller led by 8 points to 3, but N.b.
Wales ran over them in the second half.

I THE CIRCUS SCRUM. |'|
I I
(To the Editor.) * j
A Sir, — I would like you to publish j
bur version of the trouble at Hastings
jbn the 13th February, as is under. J
when we opened the early door boxes |
they were simply rushed for tickets,
and before 7.30 p.m. the tent was j
crammed. The police told mp to close i
up the office, which 1 did, leaving two
thousand people outside, clammouring J
for tickets. If it had not been for |
the police, the waggon would have j
been upset; some two hundred people
rushed clean through the tents without
tickets, and monopolised the chairs,
and the would not go out, being even-
tually seated . Through that number
getting in, the remaining crowd caused
a lively disturbance,and by 8.10 p.m.
we had the people sitting on the side
walls, and curtains, and when order
was restored, the performance was pro-
ceeded with. If it was not for such
towns as lnvercargill,
Dannevirke, Timaru, Napier, Hawera,
New Plymouth and Hamilton, where
they thorouphly support a circus, it
would not be worth my while bringing
the circus to New Zealand.
We are sorry that the Council, and
people of Hastings, intend in inflict
such heavy penalties upon us, as vve
go to no end of expense, to secure the
best talent that the world can produce,
and we feel proud to visit New Zea-
land, to exhibit it. Our daily expenses
are heavy enough without more being
added to it. We did our best to
please everybody.
Hoping that the above explanation
will he satisfactory to all concerned
and obliterate tha grievances that are
against us. —I am, yours, etc.,

UQUOR AFTER HOURS.
Woman as Sentinel,
HOTEL LICENSEE FINED
BRISBANE, Monday. While
keeping the Hotel Atlas under ob-
servation, on the night of Saturday,
July 26, the police saw a woman sttu
tioned as a sentinel at the door.
Three men came Out of the hotel,
and two more entered, whereupon
Sergeant Shersby demanded en-
trance, but the woman on guard
pointed out that she could not help
him as the door had been locked
on the inside as soon as men en-
tered.
Shersby, finding no way of enter- j
ing the premises, made a search, and
as two men were leaving, gained en- !
trance by forcing the door ..pon the !
woman who had opened it. Inside j
he saw the licensee, Bessie Corbett,
standing behind the bar, and serving i
four men with beer. No lights were !
burning in the room, but sufficient |
light came from an office nearby.
The men made an attempt to escape,
but three of them were captured.
Bessie Corbett was charged before
Mr. H. L. Archdall, C.P.M., in the
Police Court this morning, that on
July 26 she kept her licensed pre-
mises open for the sale of liquor
after hours.
Mr. H. Bergin appeared for the
defendant, and pleaded guilty.
Inspector Brosnan said defendant
since her occupation of the hotel in
March last, had endeavoured to trade
after hours and on Sundays, and the
police had made every effort to catch
her, but on certain occasions they
could not find sufficient evidence.
Her efforts to trade illicitly had been
continued to the present. Defendant
had consistently attempted to break
the laws.
Mr. Bergin said defendant had
lost her chance of having the license
renewed, when it expired 2 years 5
months from to-day.
Mr. Archdall imposed a fine of
£5, with 3/6 costs, in default 14
days.
James Downes and Richard J.
Montgomery, both of Stanley-street,
South Brisbane, were each fined £2,
with 3/6 costs, on a charge of being
found in the Atlas Hotel on July
26* after hours.


TENTS IN THE RAIN.
A SODDEN CIRCUS.
ANIMALS; RAIN AND SLUSH.
Drenched —sodden—desolate. That was
the circirs yesterday afternoon. A more
dejected sight could not have met the
eye. The old dock site resembled a
glorified mud-flat. The tents and cara-
vans faded into insignificance, and all
that predominated was mud —and slush.
Dirty, slimy, yellow clay, black, gritty
silt, old straw and rain water combined
to make a slushy mixture, inches, and in
some cases feet, deep. The tents were
almost unapproachable. They were effec-
tively surrounded by a moat of the
filthy mess, and stood in the centre of it
all, looking for all the world like two
sailing ships, lying buffeted in a dirty
sea.
In all this mud and slush, when a
“Star” man arrived, the big elephant
chained ready to pull some wagons and
caravans out of a watery grave, was
lumbering happily, pulling his great feet
out of the mess with a swish-swish, and
hosing himself by his trunk, with the
dirty water. He was in his element, but
in the entrance to the animal tent stood
two attendants, wet through, with
trousers rolled to the knees, “cussing”
at the unheeding Jumbo. “Come out!”
they yelled, and the more he churned
about the more they roared, till
Jumbo, a big filthy mass, filled his trunk,
and with a perfect shot, drenched his
persecutors from head to foot in a stream
of the messy, yellow liquid. Their
“language” increased a thousandfold.
And in the animal tent. The centre
was a perfect reproduction of the outside
duckpond-water, mud and straw, with
the cages lined about it. The lions
walked backwards and forwards in their
prisons, roars occasionally went up, but
the sodden atmosphere was reflected in
everything.
To approach the main tent, one waded
up to the doorway, and continued wad-
ing through it. Inside, the actual ring
was dry, but all round the outside was
a continuation of the miniature sea—a
sort of additional discoloured harbour.
No clown or clever performers played
to a big and happy audience. The tight-
rope hung limply, cages remained empty,
and property and accessories lay round
everywhere—wet. In one corner the
zebra was tethered, while little ponies
were tied to poles in different parts of
the tent. One piebald fellow appeared
frightened of the incessant thunder of
the deluge on the taught canvas roof, and
walked round and round his tether, work-
ing the grass and earth beneath his feet
to a bog, as if to add to the already
superabundance of mud. Assistants and
performers, some wearing gum-boots and
oilskins, others barefooted, but all
thoroughly drenched, pulled vehicles
from place to place, or sal about in
groups and laughed and joked or swore
at their misfortune. A few children
gathered on a seat, while the whole cir-
cular scene was framed by silvery cas-
cades that flowed down from the roof,
inside the flaps and thence behind the
tiers of seats.
The rain continued to fall incessantly
and more heavily. The noise of the tor-
rents buffeting the canvas became deafen-
ing. The reporter thought it time to
leave, and went out into the downpour,
to the strains of a wet but happy circus-
man singing, “Rocked in the Cradle of
the Deep.” 1
An amusing incident was witnessed
at the Grey town railway station yes-
terday morning. Sonic twenty heavy
trucks required shifting to clear the
line for the journey to Woodside, and
the small Greytown engine could not
move them. The engine driver was
about to uncouple and adopt other mea-
sures when a man came along with one
of Wirth’s big elephants that had
been detrained at the station. Ho had
been watching the little engine’s fran-
tic efforts to move the trucks, and ad-
vancing he said: ‘‘Hold on a bit, we’ll
shift ’em.” Taking the elephant to
the rear of the line of trucks and giv-
ing it a word of command, the big
beast put his head up against the end
truck and pushed the whole train, en-
jjxne and all, to the required
Acrobats’ Romance
Little Mimi is married.
Known on Wirth’s Circus program
as Mimi, the Graceful Hercules, she
was married at St. Patrick’s Cathe-
dral on Saturday morning to Mon-
sieur Eouis Perez, another member
of the company.
Mimi, who is youthful, pretty, and
rather fragile in appearance. as-
tounded the audience on Saturday
night with her wonderful strength.
She throws her male partner (Perez)
into the air, and holds him suspended
upon her two hands. She is 18 years
old, and came from Belgium with her
father and mother in the acrobatic
troupe, The Marvellous Whartons.
When Monsieur and Madame Perez
entered the ring on Saturday the band
struck up The Wedding March, which
was greeted with joyous applause.
A new feature was the first appear-
ance of Prince Guiseppe Bigongi in
a rollicking comedy act on horseback.
He stands about 3ft. high.
The Aerial Lloyds, Captain Zapf
the lion tamer, performing elephants,
| boxing ponies, six Arab horses with
i almost human intelligence, jugglers
and the inevitable clowns were other
good things provided on this week’s
program.
The costumes worn in the parade
were designed by Mrs. George Wirth.
ANIMAL PERFORMERS
Cruelty in Training Unnecessary
From time to time the methods era- ,
ployed by animal trainers have induced
criticism, and recently there has been in ;
some quarter a suggestion that perfor-
mances of trained animals should be pro-
hibited.
A strong opponent of this proposal is
Miss Daisy Cooke, a member of the
well-known acrobatic performers, The j
Cookes, who insists that cruelty among
trainers is infinitesimal, and that it is
not necessary. ‘‘Animals, like humans.' 1 ’
she asserts, “do much better with kindly
treatment.” She quotes a recent inter
view with Col. Fillis, now in Ceylon, and
who has travelled with his own circus
for 40 years.
Col. Fillis declares that cruelty is ab-
solutely unnecessary in the training of
performing animals. ‘‘l know that some'
people do use cruelty,” he said, “but I
have never found it necessary. In train-
ing dogs I never even carry a stick or a
whip. With horses one certainly has to ,
carry a whip, but that is used for £uid-» j
ance only, and not for punishment. So '
far as elephants are concerned, I have
seen mahouts very cruel, going so far as
to drive a tomahawk right through one’s
ear, while another man was behind with
a long spear. We hav e to carry a toma-
hawk, but it is always blunted so badly
that it would not make a hole in a piece
of cheese : while the hook is only used
to catch him by the tip of the ear, with-
out breaking the skin, in case he wants
to go a different way.
“Cruelty is not only unnecessary ; but
it does not pay, because animals treated
kindly live longer and do better than
those in a constant state of fear.
“Rather than introduce legislation to
prohibit animals from performing, a
better plan would be to appoint inspec-
tors, whose salaries could be met by
circus proprietors, to supervise training.
That would weed out the cruel man and
give the legitimate performer a standing
to which he is entitled, and, at the same
time, permit the public to continue to
see trained animal's, than which there is
no more interesting feature in circus
life.”
OLD TIME SALARIES.
The following list (supplied by Mr.
Edward Maas) of some salaries paid to
a few well-known artists during the
Harry Rickards’ regime at the Tivoli,
will no doubt prove interesting to some-
performers of to-day: —Alice Leninar.
£4O a week; Peggy Pryde, £6O a week;
Billy Williams, £35 a week; Charles
■ Godfrey, £lOO a week; Haekeuschmidt,
£125 a week; Johnnie Coleman, £35 a'
week; Julian Roise, £175 a week; Carl
1 Hertz, £lOO a week; Chung Ling Soo,
£4OO a week; Marzella, £7O a (week;
Walter C. Kelly, £l5O a week; G. W.
Hunter, £6O a week; the Great Lam-
bert, £75 a week; Ugo Biondi, £125 a
1 week. The great Little Tich received
a cheque for £1,250 on landing here.
• This represented his salary for the five
weeks occupied in travelling from
England. Imagine collecting £1.2'50 of
the best for undergoing a five weeks’
pleasure trip! “Tuttle Fanny Powers”
on -the other hand only received “a
present” each treasury day, because
the law would not allow her to receive
"a salary upon account of her age (six
.years).
CIRCUS ENDS IN RIOT
Revolver Shot, Brick Thrown
MELBOURNE, Wednesday.
A circus performance at Mildura on
Monday night ended in an uproar
and a free fight. Towards the end of
the programme a companion of Con-
stable Donnelly who was there was
bumped by a circus employee carrying
a ladder. He resented the interference.
A free fight followed, and a revolver
shot was fired. A brick was also
thrown, and it struck Constable Don-
fielly on the back of the head, causing
severe injury. There have been no
further developments yet.
WORLD’S TALLEST
Dutch Giant Visits London
10 EGGS FOR BREAKFAST
(“Sun” Special)
LONDON, Tuesday Night.
The London crowds were startled
when Jan van Albert, a Dutchman,
and the tallest man in the world,
stepped from the Continental boat
train. He is nine feet three inches
high, and 23 years old.
He wore a silk hat size 9£, boots of
size 13, and his frock boat and striped
trousers required yards of cloth.
His luggage included a bed ten feet
long.
It was necessary to take the roof
off the taxi-cab, and Van Albert sat in
the car with his head towering over
the framework, which he used as an
arm-rest.
Van Albert’s breakfast consists of
two soup plates of porridge, 10 soft
boiled eggs, five mutton chops, eight
cups of coffee, and 12 bread rolls. Van
Albert will shortly appear at a music
hall, accompanied by a dwarf, wl:o is
reckoned the smallest man in the
world.
MAN DEAD
WOMAN GRAVELY HURT
IN TRAGIC AFFRAY
COWRA SHOOTING
WOULD-BE RESCUER
IS WOUNDED
COWRA, Wednesday.
ONE man Is dead, a second
rs wounded, and a woman
is believed to be dying as
the result of a tragic encounter
at the home of “Snowy” Flynn
to-day. The victims are:—
Dead: James Ryan.
Believed dying: Mrs. Grace Flint.
Wounded: “Snowy* Flynn.
At 5.30 this afternoon, the police ,
say, “Snowy” Flynn arrived at his '
home and heard screams from one of
the rooms.
Entering hurriedly, he found his
wife’s aunt, Mrs. Grace Flint, strug-
gling on the floor with a man.
Flynn seized a chair and swung it-
down on her assailant’s head.
FIVE SHOTS
The man drew a revolver and fired
twice at Flynn, whom he wounded iir
arm and leg, but not seriously.
Turning the revolver then on
Mrs. Flint he fired three times.
Two of the buffets lodged in her
neck, and ope, it is thought, pierced
her lung.
Mrs. Flint’s dying depositions have
been taken.
The police scoured the country for
Ryan, who is said to have been her
assailant. After hours of search they
found his body on the railway bridge
above the town.
There was a bullet-hole in his head.
Ryan is believed to have been in
love with Mrs. Flint.
1 SOLDIERS’ CHILDREN AT CIRCUS.
• Six thousand people, the majority of
whom were children, witnessed a full per-
formance of Wirth’s circus yesterday after-
noon. This was the annual treat gen-
erously given by the Messrs. Wirth and
their clever performers and stall' to the
'members of the Friendly Union of Soldiers’
Wives and Mothers and the Sailors’ Wives
and Mothers’ Friendly Union. Each mem-
ber was invited to bring three children.
Her Excellency Lady Eorster brought her
two small grandsons, the children of the
.Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers. Archbishop and
‘Mrs. Harrington Lees were also among the
■visitors- all of whom seemed to appreciate
the fine performance as much as those for
whom it was a special and wonderful treat.
During the interval Lady Forster went into
the arena accompanied by Lady Chauvel
* (president of the Soldiers’ Wives’ Union),
"Lady Clarkson (president of the Sailors’
Wives’ Union), and Mrs. V. Sellheim, and
thanked Messrs. Wirth and the assembled
performers and staff for their splendid
generosity, and for the promise that it;
would be repeated as long as Wirth Bro- j
tilers’ circus came to Melbourne. Her Ex- i
cellency gave a provisional promise that His I
Excellency the Governor-General should j
come next year. The committee of both 1
unions then distributed among the children j
’ice-cream blocks and buns, which in itself |
was no small undertaking.
FRANK WIRTH’S AGENCY
Secures Control and Changing
Name
The agency of Wirth, Blumenfeld
& Co. has been dissolved, Frank
Wirth having purchased the inter-
ests of the several others concerned.
The firm name wall be dropped
shortly and the new name of the
office known as the Frank Wirth
Fair Booking Agency, which will
also have vaudeville connections.
There were two separately incor-
porated departments in the agency,
one confined to vaudeville and the
.other to fair, park and circus book-
ings. Because of the number of
outdoor show contracts for this
season the actual change in the
name of the office may not be made
until summer.
Herman Blumenfeld, Max Lowen-
stein and A. E. Johnson were the
principals in the vaudeville agency.
The first two named also held some
stock in the fair agency company.
Recently W’irth absorbed the vaude-
ville department and then bought
the Blumenfeld and Lowenstein in-
terest in the fair department. With
Johnson the latter are forming an
agency for vaudeville, cabaret and
club bookings, though the Wirth-
Blumenfeld name will also be
changed for that Venture.
The new line-up of the fair book-
ing agency has Frank Wirth in con-
trol. Phil St. Leon has invested in
the office and with Wirth they own
75 , per cent, of the stock. George
_7lamid, the only member of the for-
mer group to remain, has a quarter
of as formerly. Phil is
of/the Wirth Famliy riding act and
v ill remain with the turn, his con-
'mtioH being financial only.
ALICE’S ADVENTURE
Night Oat After Circus
HOME COMFORTS SCORNED
Alice had been to the circus. She
arrived home last Saturday night with
the wanderlust strong in her heart.
She scorned the comforts of her home
in Redfern. Compared with the glories
of the circus ring her habitation seemed
deplorably commonplace. The other
members of Alice’s family settl: I down
Some of the damage
comfortably, but Alice suffered from
insomnia. Too many buns, perhaps.
When the household was still Alice
left her comfortable bed, with, it must
be confessed, very little on.
Outside the high galvanised fence
her vagrant and adveturous soul
heard the roar of passing trains. _ The
great world outside was eng ;ed in its
adventures. No wonder Alice wanted
to see the world. True, there was the
stout fence between her and her
wishes, but what was galvanised iron
to her desire?
She merely pushed the whole thing
down and contemplated the passing
trains with a brooding interest. How
easy it would be for Alice to take up
her stand on those shining rails and
bump the trains off the tracks! But
she refrained, because she was a well-
brough-up elephant.
Very soon her absence from the peg
to which she was usually tethered was
After the storm —the calm
discovered by the keeper of the ele-
phants’ stables in Hudson’s timber
yards; and she was glad to ho led
back to her humble bed.
The only result of Alice’s midnight
adventure this morning was a large
gap in the galvanised fence that sepa-
rated her stables from the railway
line. But she still goes to the circus;
you can see her at the Hippodrome
every night. You can pick her out
hv the wistful look in her eyes.

San Francisco, April 18.
George Barnes and his former
wife, Irene West, and his present
wife, Margaret King, sailed to-
gether Saturday for the Orient as a
three-act in vaudeville.
Barnes and his first wife were
married for H years, appearing in

vorce from Barnes
UYENO JAPS (5)
Risely act
6 Min.; ring 3
Seils-Floto Circus
Coliseum, Chicago.
Chicago, April 18.
The Uyeno Japs have been in
■this country before if memory is
not in error, but it was simie years,
ago. It is a three-men and two-boy
combination, running mostly to
risley, although a few tumbling
tricks are offered. There is some
bungling of routine for comedy,
which is effective.
The act ranks with the very best
in risley perfot'mance and has a
fair quota of fun in its construction.

WIRTH’S CIRCUS
CANCELLATION OF VISIT
SI II ABLE GROUNDS NO'I
AVAILABLE
After having billed the town this
week, the advance manager for Wirth’s .
Circus (Mr. R. C. Mannington) has]
found it necessary to cancel the pro-1
posed visit of the circus to (feraldtonl
this month on account of suitable J
grounds not being available. An in-]
ti mat ion to this effect will be found
in our advertising columns, this em-
bracing an apology to the people of the
town, an expression of appreciation of
services rendered, and the cancellation
of any business arrangements made by
the advance manager. Holders of
complimentary tickets, however, have
been granted the privilege of using
these during the visit of the circus to
Mullewa.
It was the intention of the circus
authorities to travel over the Midland
Railway by special train, visiting
Moora, Carnamah and Mingenew en
route, but on account of the altered
itinerary the visit to these centres has
also been cancelled.
REQUEST FOR MAITLAND
PARK
MAYOR S REASONS FOR REFUSAL
The Mayor (Mr. (J. Lester), on being
isked if be would care to make, a
statement regarding the cancellation of
the visit of Wirth’s Circus, said the
•easonwhy he turned down theapplica-
ion for Maitland Park was because
leraldton was very, very short of
sports grounds for cricket, football, and
)ther games. The ladies had been
ising Maitland Park for hockey, and
he Council, without calling to any ex-
ent on the finances, had endeavoured
o plant couch grass there. A circus
‘orning along would naturally, in his
opinion, undo that work, and the paltry j
"ew pounds they would get for rent j
vould not compensate in any shape or j
orm. He pointed out that at the pre- !
ent juncture there were only about j
our or live weeks of the regular win- j
‘r season to go, and there was not a I
ticket of water to be procured at
laitland Park, or within cooee of it,
» iise with sprinklers for the improve-
aent of the ground.
He added that lie showed the advance
lanaaer for the circus (Mr. Manning-
>n) a block of ground at the corner
f Durlaeher Street and Waldeck
treet, and understood that one of his
Injections was that tlie carnation weed
light poison the elephants, whilst
nother objection was that the ground
'as too dry, and that stakes driven
ito it would not hold the tents down,
he circus people, he said, definitely
anted Maitland Park, and would not
•cep* other proposals. The Mayor
ated that he told Mr. Mannington
? late as f> o’clock on Tuesday after-
ion that he would not alter his
vision, but that if he forwarded an
iplication in writing he would call a
»ecial meeting of the Council to deal
ith if, though he would do his level
‘st to persuade the Council not to
•ant the use of the ground. “Sports

WONDERFUL SIGHTS
For Darwin Aborigines.
ELEPHANTS AND LIONS.
CFROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.)
DARWIN, p’riday.
Eight elephants belonging to Wirth’s Cir- 1
cus, which is en route to the East on the
Marella, were landed at Darwin. When the
vessel berthed the elephants were taken out of
the boats in slings and driven along the jetty
to a hessian enclosure. It was necessary to
get the elephants off the vessel to facilitate
the unloading of cargo.
Aborigines gathered at the jetty, and
watched in amazement. “All the same pic-
ture show,” said one blackfellow, in astonish-
ment. He had remembered seeing elephants
on the screen at the picture theatre.
As the elephants lumbered down the jetty,
the aborigines followed at a respectful dis-
tance, apparently in readiness to take to their
heels at any moment. While the elephants
were in the enclosure dozens of blacks sat on
a fence and gazed at the beasts in admiration,
jabbering among themselves. Others caused
annoyance to members of the circus by lifting
up the edges of the hessian and taking a peep
underneath at the elephants. One aboriginal
gave his impressions of an elephant. “Colour
all the same buffalo,” he said, “but him got-
ten two tails, one back and one front.”
Wirth’s staff put on a short performance,
to which the Darwin children flocked. The
girls from the Darwin half-caste home were
taken to the jetty, to have their first glimpse
of elephants. A number of aborigines also
paid their sixpences to see the show.
Four lions and two tigers are on the-Ma-
rella. The aborigines are mystified by the
roaring, who is occasionally heard by night
and day.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
MUNICIPAL GROUNDS
REFUSED FOR VISITING CIRC'JS
Sir,—- I learned during yesterday that
the advance manager for a world-re-
nowned circus visited the town this
week, and I also learned with some sur-
prise that the visiting gentleman met
with obstacles in his search for a suit-
able ground for the local performances
included in his itinerary. In fact, 1
am informed that suitable grounds were
not available, and as a result the pro-
posed tour of the North Midlands, and
also a. visit to Geraldton en route to
the Murchison have been cancellet .
Now, sir, there seems to be just a littl
more in this matter than really meets
the eye, and from the standpoint of
citizenship I really think the subject
should he ventilated. I understand that
the town clerk was first approached for
the use of Maitland Park, but being
apparently more or less hamstrung in
his official duties it was necessary to
refer the application to the Mayor, who
very definitely refused, the use of these
grounds. In fact, after the first refusal
I understand a further appeal was
made to the Mayor, who still stood firm
in his dictatorial attitude, and simply
told the circus representative that the
grounds would not be available. Such
being the case, I really think that we
have just about reached a stage when
the affairs of the town should be a
little more than a “one-man” matter.
Just who is this “big” man who has
taken charge? As the town’s chief
executive officer 1 certainly think that
the jtmvn clerk should have the auth
ority to handle matters of this kind
without any reference to a “boss.” In
fact, if he is not permitted to exercise
that authority, then surely it is a mat-
ter for all the “bosses” —the members
of the Council. It seems to me to be
preposterous that any member of a
civic authority—Mayor or otherwise—
should be able to adopt such an attitude
and get away with it. We have laborer
rather too long under such tactics, and
the time for a change is long overdue.
1 have no brief whatever for the circus
or its representative—and much less
for a civic representative that is so
“high and mighty”—but I do think that
a grievous wrong has been created.
Ranking as one of the State's leading
towns, Geraldton is to be deprived of
witnessing a performance by one of the
best known circus combinations in the
world. We were perhaps fortunate to
be included in the itinerary, but we are
most unfortunate in that our town can-
not provide a suitable ground to accom-
modate the show. This touring circus
has the reputation of being a good show
with a good reputation, and it is some-
thing that provides good clean enjoy-
ment for the people, to say nothing of
the pleasure that it brings to the hearts
of tiie children. Of course, the people
have to pay for their pleasure just the
same as they pay for most other things,
and so do the circus people pay for
travel —and grounds, too. Maitland
Park is on the outskirts of the town —
somewhere in the vicinity of our rub-
bish tip—and is undoubtedly an ideal
situation for a circus. No ratepayers
want roaring animals quartered in the
centre of the town, nor do they want
the circus located in some inconvenient
locality in which the show cannot he
faithfully produced. Moreover, it is
necessary to have grounds that will not
present any danger to the public.
Maybe the objection of the Mayor is
that our “picturesque” reserve—[Mait-
land Park —was damaged on the
occasion of the previous visit of a
circus to the town, but was not this
damage made good by the persons res-
ponsible? And could not there be some
indemnity to protect the Council on
this or any future occasions? The
whole matter has really got me some-
what puzzled, for I cannot understand
the reason for such obstinacy. As a
lover of the circus for over fifty years,
I very much regret that we are to be
deprived of the visit of this show that
has been refused a municipal ground:
and I also regret to learn of the dic-
tatorial attitude taken by the Mayor.
In fairness to the townspeople I really
think the whole matter should be re-
opened and discussed by the members
of the Council. I would also suggest
that the Council show some confidence
in its executive officer by giving to him
authority to handle matters of this
kind. Had the Mayor been out of town
it can just be imagined what an ineffec-
tive picture the town clerk would have
presented by being more or less unable
to deal with the application of the
circus representative for a municipal
Vround on which to produce his show.
I do hone that some action will betaken
to prevent recurrence of this nature,
for it is certainly no advertisement for
our town. —Yours, etc.,
RATEPAYER.
CORRESPONDENCE.
A PROTEST.
(To the Editor “ Cairns Post.”)
Sir, —Through the columns of your
valuable paper, 1 wish to draw the
public’s attention, to the exorbitant
charge of £lO for licence fee, charged
by the Cairns Council to allow me to
show my circus in Cairns. Before the
advent of pictures, especially Ameri-
can, there were no charges such as
licence fees, my circus is an Aus-
tralian institution and not foreign,
and all profits (if any) are kept in
this country, and not sent overseas.
Mr. Stanley Bruce, when Prime Min-
ister, stated that over £15,000,000 was
sent yearly to America from the pic-
ture industry, and now circuses and
other entertainments are penalised by
having to pay licence fees. I have
travelled all over the world, and tl._ re
are no such charges as licence fees
for circuses to play in towns. In
America, when Barnum and Bailey’s
huge circus pays a visit to a town,
the day is made a gala one, and the
town is beflagged with banners by the
tradespeople, who write to their clients
informing them of the date of the
Visit of the circus. I ask my generous
patrons over here to do the same for
me. My circus should be encouraged
to pay a visit to a town, not charged
enormous fees, which tend to drive me
away. When we visit a town more
than 1000 people come in, and as these
people spend about £1 each, about
£lOOO or more goes to the shop-
keepers. For every 5/- I get for enter-
taining the public, the tradespeople
get £5. Over the past 50 years .1
have paid over £1,000,000' to the vari-
out railway departments and it costs
nearly £2OO a day to bring to and tour
Queensland with my circus. Some ig-
norant people say we take all the
money out of the towns but they for-
get what we bring in, as stated above.
The backbone of Australia, and lovers
of horses, are the graziers and farm-
ers, and they -always pay us a visit
and come hundreds of miles to see the
circus, because we always bring
thing new. We have agents all over"
the world to send us new artists and
wild animal acts, and all our foreign
artists are a great advertisement for
Australia, and they all, without excep-
tion, want to return here. I am proud
of my collection of wild animals in my
zoo, which the children love, and the
schoolmasters say that the children
learn more in five minutes at my circus
than they do at school in five years.
As we only come round once every
two years to entertain all lovers of
horses and wild animals we should not"
be “ fined” £lO by the Cairns Coun-
cil to be allowed to do so. These fees
should be abolished throughout
Queensland, and we should be charged
the same as we are in New South !
Wales, £1 per year registration fee, i
and I ask my generous patrons to as-
sist me in getting those exorbitant
licence fees abolished.
T am, Sir,
Yours, etc.,
PHILIP WORTH. Snr.

WIRTH’S BIG SHOW
Opens on Tuesday
Wirth Bros, circus has for just
on half a century filled a big place
in the amusements of Australia.
On a visit to South America the circus
while showing at Monte Video was burnt
out and everything lost. A big Estanciero,
Don Edward Moncrief, came to their aid
and presented Mr. Philip Wirth with a
wonderful troupe of bronchos, including
the famous Moncrief. This show went to
England, where it
GAVE COMMAND PERFORMANCES
then toured France, South Africa, India.
China and Japan. Big specialty acts that
have shown with Wirths include the fa-
mous Howard Bros., mind readers; the
Yokishama troupe of Japanese acrobats
loaned by the Mikado; Herr Pagel who
carried lions about: the famous Rislings
troupe and, so on. When the Bostock show
came to Australia, Mr. Phil Wirth se-
cured its best acts and animals. He took
over the Fitzgerald circus, and now lias
added the Ivan Bros. International circus,
fo-rmed by Major Condor, late of the
A 8.C.. into his big show. The big show
staits its Perth season on the Esplanade
at the rear of the Christian Bros. College
on Tuesday next. Nine night and three
day performances will be given. Its acts
include the Four Koebes, just
ARRIVED FROM BERLIN
where they performed at the Wintergar-
ten Mayeda, one of the troupe, slides
backward on a wire rope from the 90 feet
ring pole. The seven Hiltons feature Au-
gust the triple somersault performer.
!' rohn s, educated sea lions are unique,
and Carbine, is the largest mammal of
its kind on show. There is a trouple of
female tumblers. The four Onotos ride a
motor cycle suspended on a wire, and
Leonard makes nine somersaults whilst
his cycle is travelling at 90 miles an hour
The pigmy elephants will please the chil-
dren, and Miss Wirth’s golden statue hor-o
always appeals. The:, is a trained gorilla.
Lady Betty, who makes her own bed am 1
does other house keeping jobs. And of
course there are horses, ponies, lions,
tigers—and the clowns are a clever lot.


A LARGE MAT made by inmates of the Royal Victorian Institute for
the Blind being loaded on to a motor lorry for transport to the King's
Theatre, where it will be used by Mr. Philip Wirth, jun., for his in-
door circus. The mat, which has a diameter of 40 feet, is believed
to be the largest of its kind in Victoria.

CIRCUS TIGER TEARS
TRAINER’S ARM
Attacked After Fall in Cage
But for the intervention of Mr. George
Wirth, jun., Mr. Eric Flyger, animal
trainer, might have been seriously injured
by a tiger at a rehearsal at Wirth’s Olym-
pia on Tuesday night. Mr. Flyger had
entered a large cage with Pasha and
Prince, two Bengal tigers, and was train-
ing them in a performance in which the
animals balanced on opposite ends of a
see-saw. Standing in the middle of the
see-saw, he was directing their movements
when he slipped and fell.
Prince immediately bounded forward
and seized his left arm. Pasha, who had
sensed the trainer’s defencelessness, was
also moving forward when Mr. Wirth
entered the cage with a pitchfork and
i drove the two animals back. Mr. Flyger’s
arm was badly torn by Prince’s teeth. He
| received treatment at the circus.
DRAGGED FROM
BENEATH TRAIN
MULLUMBIMBY, Monday.—“l was
unlucky, but it could have been worse,”
said Ernest Clive Boldsworth, 19, when
dragged from underneath a goods train
at Mullumbimby railway yards this
morning.
Holdsworth, who was struck by the
wheels of a truck, received a fractured
thigh and probable fracture of the
ankle.
He said that he was trying to cross
the buffers of the truck while the train
was in motion, and the wet soles of his
i rubber shoes caused him to slip.
Eye-witnesses who called to the driver
to stop the train expected to see Holds-
worth cut to pieces.
He was taken to hospital, and it is not
yet known whether it will be necessary to
amputate his leg.
New Circus Ideas
A FTER serving a long and arduous! 1
apprenticeship with his father

circus for a number of years, Mr.
Phillip Wirth, junior, is leaving the
road and is going to tour the Aus-
tralian capital cities with a circus
that will be shown in a theatre with

old.
This young man is in his early
twenties and was educated at Wesley
College. He is recognised as one of
, the world’s leading equestrian per-
formers.
His circus will include elephants;
and horses which will do their -tricks-

WIRTH’S CIRCUS AT
OLYMPIC PARK
Trapeze artists flying through the air,
the firing of the human camion ball,
the tumbling of clowns ond the antics
of a host of performing animals corn-]
bined to make last night’s opening of’
Philip Wirth Senior’s circus at Olympia
Park a memorable one.
The seven Hiltons, on their trapezes,
provided the audience with whirlwind
action and the seven De Pauls, the <
woman acrobats and contortionists, add- ■
ed gratesqueness to speed.
One o fthe elephants, which perform-
ed is stated to be more than 140 years
old.
Captain Eric Flyger’s act was carried
out with skill and daring.
The circus is in town for a limited
period only. Night performances start
at 8 p.m. and Saturday, Wednesday and
holiday matinees at 2,30 nun.

otherwise the dare-devil, death-defy-
i \g acts on the trapeze, the lions and tigers
and performing elephants, the prancing-
horses, the acrobats, and the clowms are
blood brothers and sisters to the old order.

would educate us.
We can laugh and marvel and eat

The collection of ring turns which Phil.
Wirth, jun., presented at the King’s
Theatre on Saturday night was in keep-
ing with the best circus traditions.
In a long, smooth-running programme
the outstanding items were those con-
tributed by Andrew Sole with his trained
lions, tigers, and elephants, Hector Hills’s
performing dogs, Millie and Jack Williams
in a jockey act, the clown, Fred. Ashton,
the Flying Dunbars, “Bessie,” the trick
, pony, and George Shields on the tight
wire.
i
Typical ring turns, these, and all
good in their own particular way.
The circus, which is well dressed, and
traverses its routine to the music of a
band, will give two performances daily
during the season.
CIRCUS cc: TO
TOWN THIS WEEK
The circus—in this case, Wirth Brothers
Ttd.—comes to town on Wednesday, when
tne performing elephants, the bareback
riders and death-defying gymnasts will
enter the arena at Wirth’s Olympia.
The show has lately been reorganised,
and many new acts and animal turns are
promised by the management. Mr. Phillip
Wirth is in charge of the ring events and
the show’s general presentation.
Ring Thrills at Wirth’s
Olympia Circus
T H ® springboard acrobatics of the
Seven Hiltons, who are one of the
featured acts with Wirth Brothers
Circus at Wirth’s Park, are thrilling to
a degree, while the “human cannon-
ball” is- a turn well worth seeing.
Performing tigers and elephants,
clever wire-walkers, a riding pony,
funny clowns, bare-back riders, and a
troupe of clever girl acrobats are other
good acts.
CIRCUS TURNS ON A
THEATRE STAGE
Indoor Ring a Novelty
Ground and lofty tumblers, prancing
horses, funny clowns, and all the turns
associated with a show under canvas are
promised by Phil. Wirth, jun., when he
opens his indoor circus at the King’s
Theatre on Saturday.
This type of entertainment is npw to
local playgoers, and the circus should take
on new values when seen from the com-
fort of a theatre seat.
Vaudeville acts w r ill supplement the ring
“turns.”
Mr. Cass Mahomet, the Indian Anzac, and his bride, of the Arawa tr[?]
of Maoris, after yesterdays wedding at St. Barnabas Church. The gue[?]
included the tall lady, Princess Ponteus, who is eight feet high (in the back-
ground), Pole tta, the tiny Mae West, and Ison, the pigmy.
PIT, the intelligent elephant at the Dallas Zoo, Texas, tried to take off
some weight when he joined the young lady in her slimming exercises.

ATTACKED BY TIGER.
CIRCUS TRAINER INJURED.
Incident at Wirths* Park.
While he was schooling two Bengal
lgers for a see-saw act at Wirths’ Park
yesterday morning, Captain Eric Flyger,
a former member of the A.1.F., who is
mgaged as an animal trainer at Wirths j
Circus, was attacked by one of the ]
iigers and severely clawed on one arm. j
Flyger was in a large cage training the
.igers to balance on a see-saw. A tiger
■.tood on each end of the plank, which
nad been out in the rain and was some-
what slippery. As Flyger stepped on to
the middle of the plank he slipped and
fell to the ground.
Immediately one of the tigers sprang
upon him. Quickly regaining his foot-
ing, the trainer raised one arm to pro-
tect his face, and kept the tiger Pack
with a steel prong which he carried. His
arm was oadly cut by the tiger s claws,
out otherwise Flyger was not injured.
Mr. George Wirtb entered the cage as
the second tiger was about to join m
the attack, and drove the animals back
with an iron bar. Captain Flyger had
his wounded arm bandaged, and was
able to resume his work with the tigers
n the afternoon.

INDOOR CIRCUS
Many Skilful Performers
Mr. Phillip Wirth, junior, has performed
the seemingly impossible feat of intro-
ducing a circus atmosphere into a theatre.
Although there is a sharp reminder that
the circus is indoors, when the curtain
falls for the interval there is no sugegs-
tion that the performance is a mere
vaudeville show. Clowns still frolic, with
their slapstick, pantomime, and patter, as
clowns have always done, and horses, lions,
tigers, and dogs perform their tricks. Only
one thing is missing—coir matting replaces
the sawdust of the ring. Some of the
performers showed remarkable versatility.
Miss Dorthy Williams was skilful on the
trapeze, graceful on the wire rope, and
uncanny as a contortionist. One of the
clowns succeeded in being nameless, be-
cause he had so many aliases. He was
Ecquilla, the serious acrobat; Plattier,
the comic acrobat; and Storey, the
equilibrist. The three Flying Dunbars
were skilful on the trapeze and agile in
their acrobatic turns. Captain Andy Sole
seemed equally at home with elephants,
trick horses, lions, and tigers. Miss Millie
and Mr. Jack Williams showed many
tricks of horsemanship. La Belle Marie
performed cleverly on the trapeze, and
Hector Hill was able to show that dogs
could learn new tricks.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN.
On Thursday morning three railway 4
trucks, completing the Greenhalgh and ]
Jackson collection, arrived in Brisbane
from the north. Let’s take a short
stroll around some of the marquees in
the process of erection at the Show —
a glimpse before the curtain, so to
speak, goes up.
Here is Princess Pontus, the last of ]
the Amazon headhunters, the last sur-
vivor of a giant tribe of women that j
threw off the yoke of husbands and 5
fought their own battles. Standing Bft. j
2ins. in her bare feet, and weighing 48 j
stone, the Princess will tell us why the
women of her tribe became headhunt-
ers. Her mother stood some 6ft. 4ins.,
and weighed 40 stone, but her father
was only a*small man.
In the same marquee is Isom, the
Pigipy man from Africa, who dances
his tribal war dances, sings, eats fire,
and lifts a 561 b. weight with his tongue.
Nearby we come to the pitch
(appropriate word) of Hell’s Driv-
ers, who will be seen for the first
time in Brisbane. These dare-
devil motorists chase one another
around the inside of a globe, one
in the saddle of a motor cycle, and
the other at the wheel of a midget
car.
There’s no fake about this; at top
speed the two crazy speedsters roar ter-
rifyingly through their act.
AMAZING CHANG.
A little further on we come to the
stand of Chang, the Pin-head Chinese,
who is billed as the world’s greatest
curiosity. Chang is an amazing midget,
with a head no bigger than an average
orange—he has to be seen to be be-
lieved. He is supported by a troupe of
six artists, hand balancers, magicians,
a plastic artist and midgets.
And we mustn’t forget Dollita, the
miniature Mae West; nor Marge Van*
Camp’s performing pigs, always a big
drawcard.
For those who like actually to I
participate in thrills, Messrs.
Greenhalgh and* Jackson have
brought some of the latest me-
chanical novelties to Brisbane.
There is the Tilt A Whirl, which
cost £3OOO to land here;-that old
favorite, Fun on the Farm; and an
exciting Rocket ’Plane, which loops
the loop.
Mr. Greenhalgh is expecting a great
show this year, and undoubtedly he has
come prepared to give the public some
first-rate amusement. His* shows are
on the move all the year round, and,
as he says himself, his real worry be-
gins after the Exhibition—looking for
attractions for next year. Periodically
he travels in the East, America and
Mexico, picking up fresh wonders and
marvels.
TWO MONKEYS
“IN SMOKE”
3 Caught After
Rooftop Chase
Bozo and Jane, two of the five Rhesus
monkeys which escaped from Wirth’s
Circus yesterday and eluded keepers
over two miles of roof tops in South
Melbourne, are in hiding.
I Pursuers are confident that hunger will
force the fugitives to break cover today.
Food the monkeys stole from a provision
store is expected to be about exhausted.
At 10.30 a.m. yesterday, Trixie, the
female ring-leader, extracted pins from
two cage doors. Trixie and two others
were captured about 6 p.m. while sleep-
ing in an upstairs room of the Green
Mill dance hall nearby.
The chase was described today by
their trainer, Captain E. Flyger.
Elusive Quarry
“All of the circus staff except the ele-
phant watchman, were away,” he said.
“The watchman saw Trixie let herself
out of the cage and draw the door pin
of the other cage housing Bozo and
Jane. Trixie, Mick and Alby, the cap-
tured ones, are jockey riders and do
j tricks with horses in the ring. The
I others are being trained for the same
!act.
“When I arrived 10 minutes later they
were eating bananas on the circus roof,
having raided file store.
“Tom Hitchens and George Campbell
climbed after them, but the monkeys
were too quick. They slid and jumped
on galvanised iron roofs all day, with
the men in pursuit.
“Finally the keepers pounced upon the
monkeys sleeping in a room. Bozo and
Jane got away through the window.
“They will not be far away. We’ll
get them at feeding time. They are
quite harmless.”
Trixie, Mick and Alby, unchastened
after their escapade, gambolled happily
at the ends of long ropes today.

TIGER TAMER DOES
NOT WORRY
Circus Attraction —-
Captain Eric Flyger, tiger-tamer with
Wirth Brothers’ circus, who was mauled
by one of his charges on Tuesday, entered
the animals’ cage at the opening of the
performance last night. And “the daring-
young man on the flying trapeze” had
nothing on the captain. He put the tigers
through their paces with rare abandon —
despite the handicap of an, arm in a
sling.
Other turns on the circus programme
were up to the usual high standard asso-
ciated with Wirth Brothers’ shows.
Tumblers, clowns, wire-walkers, bareback
riders, acrobats, and a “human cannon
ball” all cor M good items, with the
work of the s- >T *■ Isons, ’''e De Pauls,
and the Tatteri ? ~r junei uihg special
applause.
The circus will play a short season only,
with matinees on Wednesdays and Satur-
days.
Circus In Theatre
For the first time in Australia a
circus performance is to be staged in-
side a'theatre. Beginning on Saturday,
September 21, Mr. Phillip Wirth, junr.,
will provide a full circus entertainment
at the King’s Theatre. Lions, tigers,
elephants and horses will perform on
the stage and visits to other capital
cities will follow. While travelling,
file circus will appear in country towns
under canvas. sr**


VALE! PHILIP,
WIRTH
By Randolph Bedford
The radio can deliver shocks. I
heard over the air of the death of.
Philip Wirth, and it came more sud-
denly than the same announcement in
a newspaper.
I met the Wirths —Philip and
George—years ago. when I was a
newspaper man, after their return
from a world tour in the earliest years
of the century. The four Beechworth
lads who were the Wirth brothers had
been, by death, reduced to two. The
brothers were tireless and devoted to
their business and succeeded as men
who love their work and do not dif-
fuse their energies outside of it must
succeed.
When George retired, Philip became
owner and executive, until his familv,
carefully educated as if they were in-
tended for orthodox professions made
the circus again a family affair; sons
and daughters trained to the work of
the ring as well as to the business of
the executive.
Early in the century Wirths had be-
come the great Australian circus,
Philip mostly with the show, and
George searching the world for “acts.”
A big man devoted to the life he has
chosen and the business he loves is
generally a simple man outside of nis
work. Philip Wirth and I were warm
friends from our first time of meet-
ing, and although we might not sea
each other for years together, the
friendship revived at our first new
contact. It was almost with the self-
consciousness of a boy showing his
playthings that at one of these chance
meetings somewhere in Australia he
proudly showed me 13 new elephants.
They impressed me little as they stood
stern on—tails lazily wagging—and
when I said that their trousers fitted
badly enough to have been bought
from a, blackbirder’s slop-chest he
was so far from smiling that 1 hur-
riedly withdrew the joke. That quality
of simplicity outside of their actual
work is characteristic of circus people
and other specialists.
Their work is too hard and con-
tinuous to permit them becoming
part oi a social function which the
flesh and blood actor was; a distinc-
tion now the property of actors of the
screen. There are not many relaxa-
tions permitted to circus folk. The
executive engages in a mass of detail,
necessary equally to the long city
season and the one night stands. Use
makes a property of easiness in which
danger almost disappears; yet the
work of the acrobat, the trapesist and
the trick horseman cannot brook im-
prudences in wining and dining that
would one night find out the per-
former in his work in the air. Hard
work and the necessity for careful-
ness keep them from growing tem-
peraments.
The dramatic stage has lost to the
cinema much of its function of en-
tertaining people who can see with
greater ease than they can hear, and
can understand the words of the talkie
script more easily than the flesh and
blood drama, because there is move-
ment of both scene and dialogue to
explain it. But the circus is eternal;
closer to nature and to the romantic
adventurer that is in almost every
healthy boy and girl.
The circus, old in the days of the
Caesars, is new in 1937; childhood
•loves it, and so do men and women
who are mostly only children grown
up. The fascination of the tent; the
menagerie, the sawdust, and the
angel who rides the deliberate prancer
in the ring are changeless and ever-
lasting; even the grotesquerie of
clowns who have rediscovered the.
jokes of Grunaldi. Circuses die, but
the circus lives for ever.
Philip Wirth had a full life and he
loved his work. He had been in every
playable settlement in Australia and
the Pacific, and many people are un-
nappy for his passing. He had the
right philosophy—and that, reduced
tc elements, is that work is a fine
thing and that our difficulties are'
onlp challenges of our quality.

DEAD
Prominent Circus
Figure Passes
r PHE death in Sydney on Sunday of
-*• Mr. Philip Wirth, sen., for many
years head of Wirth’s Circus, has re-
moved from the entertainment business
in Australia one of the most colourful
and vigorous personalities which it has
ever known- There was not a town in
Australia, from large cities to wayside
hamlets, in which his circus had not
played in the last 50 years, and in every
centre he was equally well known. From
the most obscure of beginnings in the
country districts of New South Wales
and Victoria he and his brothers, only
one of whom now remains, built up the
circus which bears their name until it
ranked alongside the best of its kind in
the world.
Late Mr. Phillip Wirth
The late Mr. Wirth was a native of
Victoria, having been born at Beech-
worth in 1864. He had his first intro-
duction to the circus business before
he had reached the age of ten years,
and it was not very long after
that that he and his three brothers.
George, Henry and John, had become
proprietors of a “road show” of their
own. In those days there were few
lives harder than that of the circus
showman, but the “big top” possessed
always 'bn irresistible attraction for
Philip Worth and his brothers, who set
out upon a policy of always building
up their show by the addition to it of
fresh features.
WORLD TOUR.
In Australia they prospered continu-
ously and towards the end of the last
century had reached a point at which
with confidence they embarked upon a
world tour, a thing then never contem-
plated by even the most ambitious of
Australian circus proprietors. Unfor-
tunately the same good fortune which
they had encountered in this
country did not accompany them abroad
and their tour was marked by one mis-
fortune after another. At Buenos
Aires, in the Argentine, their tents and
most of their equipment were destroyed
by fire. In another part of
South America they met with
a disturbed political situation and
eventually they reached Africa with
only their horses, the nucleus of that
feature of their show which has always
been one of its most popular depart-
ments.
IN AFRICA DURING BOER WAR.
From Africa they continued their world
t ? ur^via England and then returned to
the Cape just in time for the outbreak
, e . E°er War. ,After a further series
of vicissitudes they arrived back in Aus-
tralia, where, shortly afterwards, they
combined with another
one success to another until to-day its
name is a household word throughout
the Commonwealth and New Zealand,
which has always been regularly visited
by it.
EOf the last seven years the late Mr.
Wirth had taken little active part in the
management of the circus, the conduct
?, which he had left chiefly to his son
Philip. He is survived by his widow
and five daughters, Mesdames G. Muh-
mel and E. Clark, and Misses Doris,
Madeline and Mamies Wirth, and two
sons, Messrs. Philip and George Wirth.
SON LEAVES BY PLANE FOR
SYDNEY.
To make arrangements for his father’s
funeral, Mr. Philip Wirth, together with
c j G ‘ .Christie, his cousin, left for
Sydney by the Douglas plane, Kyeema,
this morning.
“My father's death was a great shock,
not only to me, but to all those associ-
ated with the circus,” Mr. Wirth stated.
We have cancelled the performance at
Dalby to-night, but, to keep faith with
the public, we will show at Toowoomba
to-morrow night.”
Although for the past four years he
had managed the tours, Mr. Wirth added,
he had acted under the advice and ex-
perienced guidance of his father. The
circus has been on tour since May last,
and was shortly to return to Sydney.
For the many expressions of regret and
sympathy, he was extremely grateful.
SHOWMAN BORN.
Wirth of the Big Tent.
SAWDUST AND ROMANCE.
To be a circus performer and defy
death in tights and spangles has
been the dream of generations of boys,
the world over. Even in this sophis-
ticated age, the “big tents,” which dome
the magic sawdust rings, stir the ima-
gination of healthy youth as no cinema
or theatre can ever do.
The blare of music, the roar of lions,
the thrills, of the high trapeze, the
mummery of clowns, the mastery of
wild beasts—all these appeal as strongly
as ever to the romantic in us, and
make the heart beat faster.
It was the happy fate of Philip Wirth that
his boyhood dreams should be realised, and
end only with death. The love of showman-
ship was born in him, and he shared with
his talented brothers and sisters an inherited
zest for the open road and the excitements
of a circus life. His father, John Wirth, was
himself an adventurer in the heroic sense of
the term, and never allowed his private quest
for fortune to subdue, his passion for music.
Philip, too, was a musician of parts, but
from his earliest years found time for other
accomplishments. He trained himself to be
an acrobat, a clown, a horseman, a tent-
maker, and a business manager of uncommon
acumen. Though of heavy build, and accus-
tomed to “rough it,” he was a sensitive lad,
with a keen sense of pride. Thus, in the old
sideshow days, when he was appearing with
a partner billed as “Como the Jap,” his bro-
ther John humorously informed the audience
on one occasion that there would be a comic
stilt act by the “Crummy Brothers.”
This so offended Philip that he took off his
stilts and refused to go in, with the result
that John paid forfeit by becoming one of
the “Crummv Brothers” on the spot!
Work and Drama.
The genesis of that notable circus, which
the hoardings eventually proclaimed to be the
“Greatest Show on Earth,” was sheer hard
work, allied to pluck and imagination. Philip
and the other members of the Wirth family
practised every moment of the day, taking
falls and bruises as the inevitable penalties
of perfection, and having no teachers but
their own grit and perseverance.
They discovered that trick riding was the
hardest and most dangerous lesson of all,
notwithstanding that in the eyes of the
audience it was not nearly so thrilling as
feats on the flying trapeze. The latter,
according to Philip, can be performed in a
few weeks, whereas it requires months, and
sometimes years, to conquer the art of somer-
saulting, pirouetting, or jumping through a
hoop from a horse’s back.
Philip Wirth’s career was packed with in-
cident and drama from that auspicious night
in the eighties when the family presented its
first full circus to the people of Ararat.
Fighting against competition, sudden storms,
which levelled and tore the canvas, and the
innumerable vicissitudes that beset a travel-
ling show, the circus thrived as the years went
on, and opposition melted away.
Once, however, it narrowly escaped being
the scene of a major tragedy. That was
on January 23, 1894, during a performance
at Fillis’s Amphitheatre, in Johannesburg.
As part of the “Wild West” programme, a
“settler’s hut” was set on fire, but, to every-
body’s consternation, the flames spread to
the decorative curtains in the dome, 70 feet
above the arena. The audience promptly took
fright and rose in horror to its feet.
Realising that the fate of the building was
in the balance, and that a stampede was likely
at any moment, George Wirth and an assist-
ant, Edward Murphy, “shinned up” ropes and
poles among the blazing fabric, beat the fire
with their gloved hands, and tore the burning
rags from the rafters.
Fascinated by the spectacle, the spectators
forgot their panic, and cheered. Philip and
other members of the troupe had meanwhile
led out the horses and other animals, and
concentrated upon calming the general excite-
ment. Many human lives were undoubtedly
saved that evening.
In Foreign Parts.
There was scarcely a country in the world
that Philip Wirth did not visit with the cir-
cus, but it was in South America that he and
his brothers came to the conclusion that their
show was not all glamour and success. They
got into trouble with the authorities for al-
lowing their Zulu performers to go about in
their native costumes—that is, almost naked
—and the Zulus created even more trouble
by disappearing into the void, rather than
wear trousers and boots.
Next, a theatre in which were stored all
the wardrobe, harness, and paraphernalia of
the show was burnt to the ground, and, as
if this were not enough, there were difficul-
ties in other places with swindling interpre-
ters and contractors, and fights, in and out
of season, with swashbuckling members of the
public.
Wirth’s was the first Australian circus to
tour Britain, or any foreign country, and its
visit happened at a time when powerful rivals
were in the field—Lord George Sanger, Lord
John Sanger, Claud Genette, and several
others, all of whom were then at the height
of their glory. But the season was a triumph
from several points of view, and was graced by
the patronage of the Prince of Wales, after-
wards King Edward the Seventh. It seemed
even more triumphal in retrospect, for, only
a little later, the circus had to flee to the
Orient from South Africa on the outbreak
of the Boer War.
Philip Wirth was always in agreement with
his brother George that there was no place
in the world where the physique could be so
strongly developed and the mind so broadened
as under the “big tents” of a travelling circus.
He invariably proclaimed that circus folk
everywhere, were the most morally clean, the
happiest, and the healthiest. His life, ac-
cordingly, was not only the one of his choice,
but congenial to his taste and nature, and his
enthusiasm endured to the last.
The “Greatest Show on Earth” was not, of
course, the first circus to play before the
Australian public. The first of importance
was Cooke, Zoyara, and Wilson’s “Great World
Circus,” which astonished the citizens of Mel-
bourne and Sydney in 1866, and this was fol-
lowed in later times by Cooper and Bailey’s
circus, Ashton’s circus, Hiscox and Watkin’s
“Royal Tycoon Circus,” Charini’s, Sells’s, and
Fitzgerald Brothers’ circuses. The last was
contemporaneous with Wirth’s, and even occa-
sionally excelled it in wonders, but of them
all only the “Greatest Show on Earth” now
survives.
WORLD'S OLDEST
SHOWMAN DIES
Romantic Career Of
Philip Wirth, Sen.
The death in Sydney yesterday of
Mr. Philip Wirth. sen., marked the
passing of one of the most romantic
figures in Australian entertainment,
who, at the age of 73, claimed the
distinction of being the world’s old-
est showman.
Mr. Wirth, who was forced to flee
from South America during anti-
British demonstrations m the ’9o's,
who toured South Africa when the
Boer War was at its height, and who,
in his old age, invited his friends to
a jubilee dinner in a lions’ cage, began
his career as a side-show proprietor
at the age of 13. He lived to employ
more than 100 persons in a circus and
zoo, for which, in the darkest days of
the depression, he refused £70,000.
The late Mr. Phillip Wirth
Bom at Beechworth. Victoria, Philip
Wirth was the son of a travelling
musician. At the age of nine he
joined John Ridge’s circus in New
South Wales, but four years later he
and his brothers, John. Henry, and
George, pooled their slender resources
and bought a side-show.
In a few years the giant tents at
Wirth Brothers’ circus were famous
throughout Australia, and in 1893 the
brothers embarked on a world tour,
Which was to give them an inter-
national reputation. They met disas-
ter early, for about a year later the
greater part of the show was destroyed
by fire at Buenos Aires. They had
not well re-established themselves
when they were forced to flee from
another part of South America when
anti-British feeling ran high.
They were able to take with them
only their horses, but once more they
built up their show, and, after a visit
to South Africa, they spent more than
a year touring England, where they
gave a command performance before
King Edward VII.
Returning to South Africa they
found the British and the Boers at
war, but the Wirths made their neu-
trality clear, and they were left un-
molested —although on one occasion
their circus train narrowly escaped
demolition, as it had barely crossed
the Modder River before the bridge
was blown up by the Boers.
The two older brothers died abroad,
so that, when the circus returned to
Australia in 1907, only Philip and
George remained.
Since then the company has visited
New Zealand in each alternate year.
The only other tour abroad was made
to Java two years ago.
In 1930 Mr. George Wirth, who still
lives in Sydney, retired, leaving Philip
as the controller of the show. Al-
though he has not taken an active
part in the tours for about six years,
he continued to control the policy of
his organisation.
Late last year Mr. Wirth gave a
practical demonstration of his 'love for
the picturesque by inviting a number
of his friends to a jubilee dinner in
the lions’ cage in his Melbourne circus.
Many of the invited guests did not care
to venture into the novel dining room,
but Philip Wirth presided over the
gathering in an inner cage, while the
lions watched from within an arm’s-
length of the diners.
The circus paid more than 30 visits
to Queensland, and when its present
tour began, in May last, Mr. Wirth
decided to accompany it. He became
ill during the journey, however, and
was obliged to return to his home.
Sinc£ then he had been in indifferent
beam.
He is survived bv his widow, five
daughters, Mesdames E. Clark (Syd-
ney) and G. Muhmel, and • Misses
Doris, Madeline, and Marizles Wirth,
and two sons, Messrs. Philip and
George Wirth. Until her marriage
Mrs. Clark was connected with the
circus, and, with the exception of
Miss Marines Wirth, all the other
cnildren are still actively associated
with it. ,
When the news of Mr. Wirth’s death
was announced, his circus was at
Roma. Mr. Philip Wirth, jun., flew
from there to Brisbane by chartered
’plane yesterday, with Mr. G. Christie,
his cousin, who has been 35 years
with the circus. They will leave by
service ’plane for Sydney this morn-
ing.
The funeral will take place in Ade-
laide.


Lea Bols, the live wire theatrical mana
ger, still continues to branch out somewhere
afresh. He has now under hismanagemen
an imported Italian tenor. Cavalier Gius
eppe Giorgi who he presented last week in
Melbourne for a series of three em ?erts or
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, thing
being so good ana successful. He has nov
arranged to run a further two concerts &t
Assembly Hall, and then intends to tour
Australia, running concerts in all leading
towns throughout the States.
The Colleano Family, now known as the
Akabah Troupe, are having a very success
ful time in South Africa. They arrived in
Durban early in August after a delightful
voyage. On arrival they found that city
billed out of sight for The Akabah Troupe.
They certainly know how to handle pub-
licity there. Every tram-car carried a
single sheet, front and back, and every
corner displayed a good poster on the act.
They established box-ofiice records at the
Durban Criterion theatie, and the news-
paper reports of the performance were very
eulogistic.

Are Contortionists Born or Made ?
The Genesis of Ferry the Frog.
William James Ferry (Ferry the Frog) is appearing under the management of the Fullers in the pantomime, “Bluebeard,” at the Grand
Opera House (Sydney). Mr. Ferry is a contortionist of international repute. “Ferry the Frog” is his billing, because it is in imitation of
a frog that he dresses, with a pond for a stage setting in the way of completing the frog character of the act. The illusion is further
heightened by his performing most of his feats seated on a pedestal set on a stump. The pedestal-seat is in diameter. But that is
nothing- It would be the same to Mr. Ferry if he were working with nothing under him larger than half-a-crown. It is a thrilling act —in
the beauty of its surroundings no less than in the skill of the performer. Artistry could not further go in either respect. Mr. Ferry gives
in the following article his own stage history, together with his views on contortionism generally. He considers that acrobatic compared with
other acts are poorly paid. At the same time he has the distinction of having received the highest fee ever commanded by a contortionist —
300 dollars a-week. The illustrations in Mr. Ferry’s article —as interesting as it is comprehensive—afford some idea of his marvellous
flexibility of limb and body. But to appreciate at its full value what is probably the greatest all-round contortionist presentation of all times
readers must see his performance for themselves.
I WAS born in Philadelphia in 1872. William James Ferry is my full
name. I believe I come of Roman stock —the race, if I may repeat
what I have often remarked to my friends, that originally taught all
other races to walk on their hind-legs.
S
I have been supple from childhood.
From the time I began to walk I could do the splits, tie my legs
around the back of my neck, and perform other similar feats—with perfect
ease. So at any rate my parents assured me in later years.
For it was not until I was nearing fifteen that I became con-
scious of possessing any capability as a contortionist.
At that age I got the idea of joining a circus.
The opportunity to do this came to me while I was still
in my fifteenth year. “Peggy O’Brien’s Fly-By-Night Circus”
was the name of it. “Fly-By-Night” was not inspired by any
elusive method on the part of Mr. O’Brien in the treatment
of his creditors. The title stood for nothing more than an
intimation that it was a one-night show in one town
to-night, and another the following evening. Mr. O’Brien
played around Philadelphia all the summer. “On the lots”
is how we put it. “Suburbs” is the English equivalent of
the phrase.
I went along to Mr. O’Brien’s manager.
I had a singlet and a pair of tights—green and yellow.
Told him I was a contortionist. He did not ask for a try-out.
There was nothing of that in those days.
“You start right away!” was his cheerful reply.
Salary was not mentioned. I was more than satisfied
to leave that to him. All I wanted was the start. At the
end of the first week I received 15 dollars. My pay remained
at that during the comparatively brief period I was in the circus. I just
did what is known as a straight contortion act.
Then I joined in Philadelphia, the same summer, a physic show.
Ever heard of them here? They are given in a tent. The idea is
free admission, with an entertainment to attract the public, and for the
doctors controlling the venture to give—at intervals —exhibitions of the
cures they are capable of effecting. Briefly it is their way of advertising

themselves. There were half-a-dozen acts. My salary—2s dollars a-week.
Nor was the summer (June, July, and August) yet at an end.
During the winter I appeared for the same money with a little vaude-
ville show in and around Philadelphia, New Jersey, and Delaware.

Close to where we lived in Philadelphia there is a frog pond.
As a boy I spent many hours in the vicinity of it. I think it was
through seeing the frogs that, later, I adopted the stage setting with which
I have become identified —myself a frog, with a pond back-
ground. My earliest, tentative effort in this direction was
with the physic show to which I have already alluded.
But it was in the following summer (to be exact —July
8, 1888) that I consider I definitely adopted the frog
character.
This was in vaudeville at Boker’s Pavilion, Atlantic City,
New Jersey. My make-up consisted of a frog mask, with the
same colored tights and singlet in which I had made by
debut with Peggy O’Brien —green and yellow. But I did no
more than hop on to the stage in the mask. Having made
my entrance I would take it off and go through my act in the
ordinary way.
Improvement came with my appearance not long after-
wards with Forrester’s Burlesque Co.
When at night I returned to the hotel where I happened
to be staying I practised in my room till nearly daylight.
The cuspidore was invariably clean, for at that time I was
not smoking, and never used it. Working one night in this
way my foot more or less accidentally came up round my
neck in the manner shown in the illustrations on the fol-
lowing page. Instantly I realised the value of performing
some of my feats from a circular seat of a similar character. The first
things used by me in this innovation were a beer mug and a Japanese
saucer —the mug as a rest for the saucer.
So far I was doing only half my act as a frog.
Gradually it dawned on me that it would be better if I preserved the
creation right through. I felt that when I removed the head I broke the
illusion. I was with the Forrester Burlesque Co. for sixteen weeks. Be-
fore I finished I was doing the act without showing my face till the end of

the performance. has there been any departure from this present-
ation, except in added effects, since I then introduced it —well over thirty
years ago. Originally I got others to assist me in the making of the
costumes.
But for a long time now I have pre-
pared them myself. Apart from the
papier-mache head, everything I wear is
silk, colored with dyes. We found these
better than water colors. In one of my
experiments I used ordinary house paint.
The tightening up of the material was
such that I could not get into the cos-
tume a second time.
The life of a suit? About six months.
It is around the joints that it then goes.
I have been playing the Keith time at
intervals for nearly thirty years.
I opened with that firm at the Bijou
Theatre, Boston, on June 6, 1891. That
was my first important engagement.
Later they built a second house in
Philadelphia—the Bijou. Beginning in
that way Keith’s to-day control 200
theatres.
1 was just completing my fourth
consecutive year with them when Mr. Fuller engaged ‘me for
Australia.
From the time I first became associated with Keith’s I have per-
formed in many other countries—Canada, England, Belgium, France Ger-
many, Austria, Russia, Italy, and South Africa.
Nearly twenty years ago I was in Australia, first with McAdoo’s
.Tumlee Minstrpls pnd Hior wi+n
Joints loose, stretchable cords and sinews, and the
gristle in the back soft.
There you have the three essentials in contortion-
ism. Given these there are varying possibilities of
development. But without such natural qualifica-
tions to begin with it is hopeless to think of achiev-
ing distinction in that line of business.
Born, therefore, are contortionists —to the extent
indicated.
At present I neither drink nor smoke. I found I
could not smoke without doing so to excess. From
fifty to sixty cigarettes a-day was my indulgence. For
years I participated in the drinks of the country
in which I happened to be —for example, in Germany
a little beer, and in France a little wine. Never to
excess!
But however moderately taken I found I was bet-
ter without it.
I do not think the claim is likely to be challenged
that I have been longer before the public than has
been the lot of any other contortionist.
Perhaps the explanation lies in three things—the
care I have always taken of myself, the good, robust constitution with
which I was undoubtedly blessed, and the precaution ever observed bv me
in working along safe lines.
For there is nothing in contortionism itself to shorten one’s life, pro-
vided you are built that way, and re.
frain from over-taxing yourself.
From this pronouncement I exempt
women. To them contortionism is phys-
ically injurious.
The greatest feat that I ever wit-
nessed by a contortionist of either sex
was performed by an Australian girl,
Rosie Aquinaldo, then a member of
“The Tasmanian Troupe” in Ringlings’
Circus. First, it consisted of what is
known as a teeth spin. By this I
mean that, holding in her mouth the end
of a strap, she circled round —face down-
ward —the upright rod to which it
was attached. But whilst thus revolving
in mid-air her legs and body were so
thrown back over her head that her
toes might be said to be point.
TT » . , , * n g to the rod in the centre of her ambit.
Lnfortunaely rt was not long after I saw Miss Aquinaldo that I heard
of her death. For myself I can’t help thinking that it must have been in
some svay due to the fearful strain of the feat I have sought to describe.
d*
As a back-bender the younger of the Groh brothers—the two with their
sister appeared in Australia with the Fullers —is probably without a rival
m the world. Contortionism demands slimness. Stoutness is an insuper-
aole bar to success in such work. You had an illustration of this in the
Famous Selig Zoo Chimpanzees in the First Horseless Carriage in U.S.A.
Mary is at the wheel and Mike at the brake of the First Horseless Carriage in
the United States, before automobiles, in 1883. The carriage is owned by Colonel
Selig.

Acrobatic are the poorest paid of all
acts. I have been exceptionally fortun-
ate. At the Casino Municipale, Monte
Carlo, I received 300 dollars a-week over
a month’s engagement—the highest sal-
ary ever paid to a contortionist.
The men who top the salary-list in
vaudeville are comic singers. U you
don’t believe this ask Harry Lauder. Yes;
I would place the money-makers in this
order: —Singing comedians, patter com-
edians, and eccentric comedians. After
them, say, sketch artists.
For many years my daily routine was
(so far as circumstances permitted of my
adhering to it): —Contortion practice for
three or four hours, followed by gym-
nasium exercises for two hours, and
then a Turkish bath.
My dieting is an easy matter. At m-f>
sent I am doing two performances a-da>
—afternoon and evening. I eat a light
breakfast. Nothing then till after the
matinee, when I may have, say, a small
piece of steak. That sees me through the performance at night. After
it is over I eat anything I can get.
jt
Climatic conditions change the whcle system.
For a contortionist, summer is the ideal weather. Th. it is that
in this respect Egypt and Australia „ c best
countries in which I have worked and Canada and
Russia the worst. . But despite such extremes in
weather 1 have always got through my act withoul
any great effort.
Before coming on to the stage I invariably do a
little limbering up in my dressing-room.
Appreciation of my efforts varies with the theatres
in which I am performing rather than the countries
in which I have appeared. The intimate touch, with
artistic surroundings, is what. I like.
My success at the Palace, London, was just as pro-
nounced as it was at the Palais de Te, Brussels, or
the Royal Theatre, New York.
. 1
When I lose my seat on the pedestal (as I some-
times do) I generally land on the stage on all fours
—like a cat. Apart from such mishaps—and others
—I would say that contortionism has never interfered
with my health in any way. I work better to-day—
with more ease than I ever did at any other period
of my life. I have no fear of age affecting me as a
performer. I expect to go on till I am sixty. If I
retire then it will be because I have the means to
do so. I have affidavits as to mv introducing
the frog make-up at Atlantic City away back in the year' al-
ready stated. There are performers still living— Needham and
Kelly —who saw me appear there.
Almost about the same time my act
was seen by a man I have just
had the pleasure of meeting in Aus-
tralia-Torn Haverley (Haverley’s Revue
Co.). All the same I have had imitators in
pretty well every country I have visited.
I am well protected in America. The
Vaudeville Managers’ Association sees to
that. Only recently that body intervened
in the case of an imitator —an imitator, I
should say, to the extent of my costume.
For I am alone in some of the feats I
perform. One of these is my side dislo-
cation from a trapeze.
Another excellent body in America is
the National Vaudeville Artists’ Associ-
ation. It has absorbed the majority of
the White Rats, and has to-day a member-
ship of 12,000. Theatrically speaking its
club house in New York is the finest in
the world.
The N.V.A. is a creation of the past
few years.
Its success is largely due to E. F. Albee,
the head of the Keith firm, and the master-mind in American vaudeville,
bmee the formation of the United Booking Office, the work of Mr. Albee,
it is possible for an artist, to secure a hundred weeks’ consecutive engage-
ment where previously the limit was from ten to eighteen weeks- —
consecutive. Mr. Albee has put his heart and soul into the N.V.A. The
many advantages for a light membership fee include the payment on the
death of a member of 1000 dollars to his or her nearest relative Veiyf
nice, I consider—in view of the high cost of dying.
? n r , th , e associatlon is fulfilling beyond all expectations the purpose
Mr. Albee had m view when he became its guiding star—the welfare of the
individual artist, a better understanding between performers and man-
agers, and the uplift of the whole vaudeville profession. Thus has he
earned the thanks and gratitude of us all.
Mr. Albee does not permit from the stages he controls the ridiculing
of any race, creed, or nationality. -*■
Ihe range of his benevolent activities is shown by his giving on the
one night no less than three benefit-performances for the firemen and
pobcemen of New York in three of the biggest theatres in that city.
For several reasons I am glad to have had the opportunity of re-
visiting Australia.

DIVORCE DRAMA.
A DRESS REHEARSAL.
• Leri . Lady at Legal Loggerheads.
Allegations of Adultery With “An Italian
Gentleman”.
What may be d . , bed ar a full
dres-s re heartof .. liVoreo court
drama was staged at the Central' Sum-
mons Court on Tuesday last.
The leading lady was Vera Heller, 1 ,
who \vi>i ’figure as the respondent in.
the divorce suit, and the hero of the
piece, John Heller. Vera’s ini.- baud,;
who will be the petitioner.
It seems that there has been some
question about the payment of alimony
pending the hearing of the suit, and
oh August 2 Heller went along to see
his wife. Apparently hot words pass-
ed between then so A ; . the end John
ride use of ■:< oa that Vera de-
clared put the* car cf death in her
heart.. Accordingly she ran off to-
a C nber Magistrate and took out'
a summons against hubby for using
threatening words.
The words she alleged her husband
used ..rid -hich sent a series of icy
shiver s down her spine were,- “I will
ihill you”, and she prayed that he be
hs> • ■d over to keep the peace towards
Mr. J. W. Abigail appeared for, her,"
anl M" load docks Cohen defended the
husband. vno idea led m.t &•?!-r.
Vera is a n>,l. .crmim .ek-
ing woman, with a mouthful of to id-
filled teeth.
Smilingly, she entered the witness-
box, and in matter of fact tones ex-
plained that the trouble arose out of
a matter of money—alimony. Her hus-
band was bringing a suit in divorce
which ?he .was defending, and she
had made an application for support
pending the hearing of the suit.
.Following cn this, hubby called at
her address, 88 Devonshire-street. Her
cousin.* refused to let him in, but, in
order
TO AVOID A SCENE,
she went out to see him. By way of
greeting lie informed her that he
wasn’t going to give a prostitute £1 a
week, ard t’iefi - atoned to shoot her
ana hm aut.iio uo wall if they inter-
fered.
Hy way of showing there was some
foundation for her belief that, her hus-
band would carry out his threat, Vera
dated an incident that occurred at the
Theatre a few weeks ago. She
was there with a .cousin named Mrs.
Broi n, and her husband thumped b. r
on fhe back and made a scene.
Mr Cohen f cross-examining) : Your
husband has in: tiluAd p ccc digs in

adultery with a “gentleman from

M’-s. Heller (carelessly): I do not

Do you know Mr. Bernasconi, an

Was Bernasconi Jiving there? —No.
What i Weren’t you actually caught
in the act of adultery in this house in

gested paying her i per week, and
she answered, “No, you dir,y mong
She also denied saying, *’l don -:, want
to know you. I have got

than ever you wire”.
Mr. Cohen: Didn’t he say to you
eventually, “All right, stick to your
‘dago’”?—No. '
And didn’t you cry out, “You will
shoot me, will you?” and run inside m
a dramatic manner?;: —No.
This threat was made fourteen days
ago, arid you . • still alive?—-Yes.
Have you seen your husband since
he made this terrible threat. Yes,
nearly every day.
And he ha'sn’t' shot you yet? —No,

shattered that you have had to con-

Mr. Abigail: he saw her solicitor
instead!
Mr. . kited: That is why she is
here, The must .ave plenty of money
to sperc”.
Aubr Fuiford, a cousin of the com-
plain r v a id that he closed the door
when he found Heller there cn August
2 but afterwards Mrs. Heller wen.
out and her husband threatened to put
a hole in her.
Mr c .in n: You work at the ■ accs
No, at home, cleaning my
machines and making buttons.
So you’re a buttoner? —No.
You do go to the races frequency.

Why. are you a pugilist?—No.
Bid you ever do any boxing or fight-
ing?—Yes.
I thought you are not a pugilist?—
Neither I am. It is twenty years ago
since I boxed.
Even how you would be prepared to
take your own part?—Yes, against
him. He can only take his part
against a woman.
You know he is
SUING FOR DIVORCE
and claiming, £lOOO from “a Dago gen-
tleman”? —Yes.
Do you know that gentleman’s name?
—No.
Have you heard the name Bernas-
coni?- —No.
Do you know a man named John
Seale, alias Beranseoni? —Yes.
Mr. Cohen: Well, that is the gen-
tleman .
Fulford: He is a gentleman, too!
Another cousin of the complainant,
Elsie Brown, a single woman, corrobo-
rated Mrs. Heller regarding the Ly-
ceum incident.
• Unlike his wife, Heller, who is an
acrobat, looked dead serious when he
i- veered the witness-box. His version
ct : w affair differed entirely from his
wife's.
He said that some fifteen or eighteen
;months ago he instituted proceedings
in divorce against his wife, and re-
cently the question of alimony had
cropped up. His wife wanted 30s per
week, but as things were slack in his
line, he didn’t want to pay more than
£1 per week. He went along to see his
wife, end sho greeted %im with "What
,do you want, you mongrfel?’ Quietly,
ho inquired Sf she expected Ttjin to
pay 80s per week when he was
in constant -work, and then went mi;
“You know you are living in adultery*
with this Bernasconi, and he is keeping
you. Surely you don’t want more
than £1 per weelf from me”.
Her reply to this was amazing.
"You shoot me. you mongrel. You shoot
me!” she cried, and ran inside. Her
cousin, Aubrey Fulford, came on the
scene then a.nd wanted to fight him;
but he indicated that he preferred: legal
weapons to nature’s weapons, and
walked off, _
"Did you oaLl your wife a pros-
titute?” inquired Mr. Cohen.
“No”, replied Heller, seriously, “I
know she
IS STILL MY 'WIFE
and owns my name, even if ehe is
living with a Dago”!
‘‘Have you any intention of shooting
your wife?” pursued Mr. Cohen.
‘‘Certainly not”, replied Heller. “I
have never been to prison yet ”
"Everything comes to those who
wait”, chimed in Mr. Abigail.
“Always to a woman, but very sel-
dom to a man’, countered Mr. Cohen.
“T’m not going to prison over her’,
declared Heller, jerking his head in the
direction of his wife.
Referring to the Lyceum incident.
Heller said his wife approached him
there and said, ‘*Hello, you flash mon-
grel. Aren’t you going to 'keep me
Instead of taking women to afternoon
tea?” There was no truth in that
insinuation.
Mr. Abigail: How long have you been
married?
Holler was understood to say nine
years.
How many children have you?—None.
And you an acrobat?—My wife
That Will do. Didn’t she leave you
because o’’ your acrobatic cruelty to
her? —No. She left me
Is Miss Brown a decent respectable
girl?—l leave that to you.
I am giving you a chance to paint

she isn’t.
Do you think she i • % Ija: " —Yes.
Questioned as to the cause of his.
wife bringing the proceedings, Heller
said she wanted to get rid of him
because of the loVe she had for "the
Dago” with whom she was living
IN OPEN ADULTERY.
Mr. Abigail: Living in adultery with
your wife and he is not dead yet?
Heller: res. I don’t
You haven’t even sent him an un-
dertake r’s card?—N >. 1 have no dead
lying about and I don’t intend to have
any.
Y r ou don’t work in the day time?—
No.
Arc you one of those gentlemen
who go out at night with your imple-
ments of trade? —T work at night on
the stage; not in the way you suggest.
Do you suggest anything against
Aubrey Fulford? —I suggest he has
never worked in his life. He lives on
the racecourse. He has taken me out
and made me lose my money many
times.
Don’t you live or the races? —Me?
I ’haven’t been there for six weeks.
Your wife tells me she has patvned her
wedding ring to furnish you with funds
to go out punting?—Then I must say
she is a lady!
Y"ou mean she is a liar?—(Satiri-
cally): No, she’s a perfect angel ‘of a
woman.
That is why you want a divorce?—
(Feelingly): It is!
Mr. Abigail (bowing): /
, Heller (politely): Thank you!
The Magistrate convicted Heller, and
ordered him to find a suylv of £?0
to 4 *keep the peace for six months, in
default a month’s imprisonment. He!-,
Her was also ordered to pay £1 3s,
costs.

SAWDUST AND SPANGLES
Wirth’s Entertain 5,000 Mothers and Children
CLOWNS AND GRIZZLY
In 1916 Mrs. V. C. Sellheim, wife of Brigadier-General
Sellheim, enlisted the sympathetic interest of Messrs. Philip
and George Wirth for the members of the Friendly Union of
Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers.
Since then, when Wirths’ Circus
visits Melbourne each year, mem-
bers and their children are given
great pleasure by an afternoon at
the show. Last year members of
the Friendly Union of Sailors’
Wives and Mothers and their chil-
'dren also attended.
This annual entertainment was
repeated yesterday afternoon, when
the vast Olympia building held 5000
delighted mothers and children.
Every available seat was occupied,
and extra chairs had to be re-
quisitioned.
The atmosphere became very
heated, and when members of the
committees distributed icecream
and bath buns the refreshment was
much appreciated.
VICE-REGAL INTEREST
Lady Forster is the patroness to
the unions, and closely follows up
the lead given by the wife of our
former Governor-General, who,
when the war began, originated the
movement.
Yesterday Lady Forster was
among the interested audience,
and with her were her two small
grandsons, and Lady Digby’s little
daughter. Later Lady Digby
joined the party. Others included
Dame Mary Hughes, Lady Chauvel
(president of the Friendly Union of
Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers),
Lady Clarkson (president of the
friendly Union of Sailors’ Wives
and Mothers), Lady Glasgow and
her daughters.
On arrival Lady Forster was re-
ceived by Messrs. P. and G. Wirth.
the two presidents, two of the vice-
presidents (Lady Bridges and Mrs.
geilheim) and the hon. secretary of
the Soldiers' Wives (Mrs. Musther).
Bouquets of beautiful red roses
presented by Miss Jessie Wise-
man (Mr, and Mrs. George Wirth’s
niece) and two small girls—Elaine
Knox Knight and Rosemary
Downes.
ARENA WELCOME
Mr, Philip Wirth welcomed Her
Excellency, and spoke of the plea-
sure it gave Wirth Bros, to enter-
tain the women and children of the
men who fought.
~ His brother and himself were de-
termined not to forget all we owe to
those men, and would always con-
sider it an honor to entertain their
mothers, wives, and children. He
asked Lady Forster to persuade the
Governor-General to make one of
the audience at next year's circus
party.
Lady Forster who stood in the
arena for this welcome, and faced
the members of the circus com-
pany; said she deeply appreciated
M" Worth's welcome, and on be-
‘ ijalf of both unions she expressed
sincere thanks for the splendid en-
tertainment. She promised to give
Mr, Wirth's message to Lord For-
ster,
WONDERFUL DAY
The programme was wonderful.
It embraced an almost endless
variety of star turns by men, girls,
horses, dogs, lions, elephants, a
grizzly bear, a goat, and some geese.
The clowns evoked peals of unre-
strained mirth from small boys and
girls. The beautiful JhorseS- and
ponies and their riders were gazed
at with admiring eyes.
A kind mother of a soldier called
at the Children’s Hospital for little
Jean McDonald, who lies crippled
in a cot on wheels. Jean had a
happy afternoon, as her friends
wheeled her from the hospital to
’ the circus.

“SEEING” BY TOUCH.
Unique Nature Study.
At the invitation of Messrs. Wirth Bros,
a number of blind children from the Royal
Victorian Institute for the Blind A'isited
Wirth's Circus yesterday. Many of the
animals in the menagerie, particularly the
elephants, were paraded, and members of
the staff took considerable paing to allow
the children to “inspect” the animals. They
were lifted on the backs of the elephants,
they stroked their heads, their ears, and
their trunks, and the various characteris-
tics of the animals were explained to them
by their teachers. “Peggy,” the baby
elephant, performed a few tricks, which
were explained to and evidently enjoyed
by the sightless audience. A monkey
was brought out, and several of the chil-
dren, running their hands over his head, ex-
claimed, “Why, it is just like a human
being!” Mr. James Angus, a vice-presi-
dent of the institute, proposed a vote of
thanks to the management, and said that
the visit would prove a great education
to the children, who heartily appreciated
I the kindness extended to them. In second-
ing the vote of thanks, the treasurer (Mr.
W. H. Edgar) said that it could be realised
! what such a visit meant to the children,
who had the opportunity of touching live
animals. Their visit would long be re-
membered. It had brought the circus
to those who see through the tips of their
fingers. The superintendent (Mx. J. W.
Hedger) said that the visit would help
the children in their natural history train-
ing.
BLIND CHILDREN LISTEN AT
CIRCUS
Children from the Royal Victorian
Institute for the Blind visited Wirth
Bros.’ menagerie today. They lis-
tened to the noise of the animals, and
tried to visualise the appearance of
the harmless ones by touching.
The 11 elephants came in for a
good deal of attention. They seemed
to hold no fear for the children, who
felt their trunks by way of shakung
hands.
One of the elephants caused great
delight by playing a mouth orgpa.n.
Some of the children were given rides
on the back of one of the elephants.
Mr G. Angus expressed thanlCs to
Messrs Wirth and the circus sta.££ on
behalf of the children, and said that
it had been a pleasure and an edu-
cation to them.
LITTLE MAYS BIG SALARY.
Circus Rider Issues Writ.
Standing 2ft. Bin. high, and weighing 4st.,
Guiseppe Bignoli, who adopts the ring name
of Prince Bighongi, has bepn a conspicuous
figure at Wirths’ Circus. The little man
used to perform some startling equestrian
feats. Recently the condition of his health
demanded that he should retire from the
circus ring for a while.
Yesterday Mr. F. E. Bateman, acting on
behalf of Bignoli, issued a writ against
Wirth Bros, claiming £lOO, which Bignoli
said was underpaid. He was entitled to
£2,600 a year, and, .-ecording to Ins claim,
he had been paid only £2,500. Wirth Bros,
claim that under the agreement Bignoli was
paid in full.
BABOON HUGS GIRL
BALLARAT, Friday.
A baboon attached to a side-show in
the Ballarat Show Grounds, broke
away from his keeper yesterday and
made an attack on a girl who was
near the tent.
It threw its arms round her waist
and violently shook her, hut was cap-
tured before the girl was injured. It
was led away growling with anger.
CIRCUS ROMANCE
Wooing of Mimi
WHIRLWIND COURTSHIP
. . . And so Mimi and Louis were
married. . . .
They met in the Bohemian atmo-
sphere of circus life. The reeking
aroma of the tan, the roars of lions
and tigers, and the prancing of the
show horses was the setting for the
romance. She was a shy little Bel-
gian maid, the belle of the circus. He
—one of a champion hand-balancing
double.
Before his advent into the lists of
love, all the young bloods of the com-
pany had their eyes on her.
Then Louis arrived. He was a fast
worker, this gallant—and, after a
month of whillwind courtship, she
whispered “Yes.” They would have
gone off there and then to the nearest
parson, but her Pa was not ready.
And there was a small detail of a con-
tract with the circus proprietor.
THE GREAT DAY
The great day of the expiration of
the contract arrived last Saturday,
and Mimi Warton and Louis Perez
of Wirths’ Circus, after knowing each
other for just twelve months, entered
on a double turn for life the same
day.
Mimi was born at Brussels 18 years
ago. She is the charming little bru-
nette, with the bobbed, wavy hair
who, for one her size, performs mar-
vellous feats of strength at the circus.
In the act, although she weighs or
7st. 51b., she swings her husband, who
is much heavier, above her head as
though he were a kitten. Mimi’s feats
cause some misgivings on Louis’s
part. ... A husband does not need
to be detained too often at the club
with that kind of wife, you know. . . .
MEXICAN HUSBAND ’
Mimi was a member of the troupe
of acrobats known as the “Marvellous
Wartons.” The contract with Wirths’
having expired, her mother and father
sailed for Belgium by the Ceramic
yesterday.
Louis Perez was born in Monteriaz,
Mexico, and is 28 years of age. When
a baby his parents left the land of
revolutions and Bohemian cabarets,
and settled in France. There Louis
received his education, and, at 14,
heard the call of the footlights, and
started a balancing turn with a part-
ner. He has travelled over almost
all the world, and came to Australia
a little over twelve months ago-, under
engagement to Mr. George Wirih,
with his partner, Mr. Evans. Perez
intends to continue the show busi-
ness with M r . Evans, and will also
double in a turn with his wife. At
the expiration of the present season
they will journey to England to play
the music halls there.
“I wish everybody were as happy as
I am, and then the whole world would
be right,” he told a Sun representa-
tive to-day. Mimi echoed his senti-
ents.
MANICURING A LION
He Snarled and Roared
YET NAILS WERE CUT
Manicuring a lion! Not a job
to be done with nail scissors,
a file and polishing pad, espe-
cially when the lion in question is 25
years old and has never been done be-
fore.
Colombo’s nails needed attention as
they were growing into his feet, so
Mr. George Anderson, genera] manager
of Wirths’ Circus, called in Mr. H.
Kendall, and the operation was pre-
formed to-day.
Jammed up into one end of his cage
with boards to prevent his moving,
Colombo, the king of the circus, was
after some time, induced to put his
paw into a noose at the end of an
inch rope.
Then, to the accompaniment of roars,
growls and frantic snarlings at the
imprisoning. boards, his paw was
drawn through the bars and secured.
A preliminary examination —and a
pair of creeps 13 in. long .vere used. _
and off came the claw.
Very little pain was attached to the
actual operation.
“More difficulty was experienced by
Mr. H. Smith, the trainer to induce
Colombo to put his other paw in the
noose, but at last he succeeded, and
off came a second claw.
The end of a stick, which was i
placed conveniently near Colombo’s!
mouth to draw his attention from the'
boards pushing up against him, was
chewed to splinters at the finish of
the operation
Mr. Kendall explained that the oper-
ation on Colombo was only a simpl\ '
one compared to a similar operation,
performed on the lion at the Zoo re-
cently.
On that occasion the claws had
grown into the pads of the paw, but
Colombo’s nails —dew claws, as they
are called —are really *only supernum-
erary ones, and grow a little way up
j from the pads.
Freaks As Fortune-
Makers.
A DWARF WHO EARNED £l5O A
WEEK.
Whatever may he thought of the
taste of people who flock to gaze on
human monstrosities, there can be
no question that ministering to that
taste is highly profitable.
The world is scoured for “freaks,”
and there may be a fortune in a
single “find,” particularly if ire or she
be exceptionally diminutive.
Even some minor “freaks” are
great “draws.” At Nottingham Goose
Fair the public has paid in one day
move than £lOO to see a certain fat
woman, and another “freak” two
years ago proved that she was worth
£l3O a week in Scotland. The tak-
ings during four weeks she was ex-
hibited there amounted to £662 3s.
6d., and, in addition, 5000 of her
photographs were sold, as well as
more than 600 copies of her “Life.”
Prides of the Fair.
A third woman, who exhibits on
her own account, is an equally great
attraction at fair grounds. She is
known to the public as a mermaid
but she is merely without legs, anc
wears a tail in their place. She is
so well-to-do that recently she paid
more than £l5OO for a motor wag-
gon.
There is, too, a woman minus arms
and legs whom people have paid an
'enormous sum in the aggregate to
see. ' She has received £3O a week
for exhibiting herself in a travelling
show, and about a year ago she
bought an animal show for £lOOO.
But first-class “freaks” can com-
mand so large a salary that for many
years there were only three per-
manent exhibitions in the country for
which it was “business” to engage
them —and this number is now reduc-
ed to two. Yet the worth of such
monstrosities is less in Britain than
it is in America or on the Continent.
Some of them get about 25 per cent
less here than in the United States,
France, Africa, Asia, or Australia.
A Midget’s Salary.
One of the largest salaries ever
paid to a “freak” in England was
£l5O a week. It was drawn by a
well-known dwarf now living in re-
tirement. Generally the earnings of
“freaks” range from £5 to £lOO a
week.
Many “freaks” amass fortunes.
Chang and Eng, the original Siamese
twins, spent several years in Eng-
land, and returned to the United
States with a fortune. They bought
a farm in South Carolina, married,
and settled down for the remainder
of their days. But they were ruined
by the Civil War, and were obliged
again to make a tour of the world.
Just as they were on the high road
to a s'econd fortune they died.
The “ Pig-faced Lady.”
Another joined couple, Josefa and
Rosa Blazek, left £40,000, in addition
to a large farm in Czechoslovakia.
No less fortunate, from a pecuniary
point of view, was Mine. Stephens,
the “Pig-faced Lady.” She founded a
hospital in Dublin, and in the board-
room of that institution there used
to be her portrait, as well as a
silver trough which, when she was
on exhibition, was hung round her
neck, and from which she ate.
Big men and little men have like-
wise attained independence by exhi-
biting themselves. A successful mem-
ber of the mighty race was Patrick
Cotter, an Irish giant, who, having
made a fortune, retired to Bristol,
where he died. Joseph Boruwlaski,
the Polish dwarf, reached England
penniless, and made so much money
by showing himself there that he re-
turned to private life at Durham, and
there spent the remainder of his
days.

“NO EARTH TO REST
ON COFFIN”
Vault To Be Built Over
Mr. V/irth’s Remains
ADELAIDE, Wednesday.
By instructions contained in his will
no earth is to rest on the coffin of the
late Mr. Philip Wirth, governing direc-
tor of Wirth’s Circus, who will be
buried at the North-road cemetery on
Friday.
Mr. Wirth, who died at his residence
at Coogee on Sunday, wished to be
buried in Adelaide, and his remains
have been brought here. Instructions
in his will provide for a family vault,
but as there has not been time to com-
plete this a bricked-in enclosure has
been prepared for the coffin, which
will be covered by a granite slab. The
vault will be built over this.
It was at first intended that the
funeral should be private, but many of
Mr. Wirth’s associates and old-time
showmen will attend. Some will reach I
Adelaide on Friday morning from,
Queensland. His eldest ifm, Mir.
Philip Wirth, will arrive by ’plane to-
morrow.
CROWD AT PHILIP
WIRTH’S FUNERAL
ADELAIDE, Friday.-—The large crowd
| which attended the funeral of Mr. Philip

included many people who have been as«
sociated with Wirth’s circus during the
past 40 years.
There were two carloads of flowers.
Some old employees, now not in the best
of circumstances, walked from the city
to the cemetery.
One man said he was a billposter 40
years ago, and had kept in touch with
| Mr. Wirth ever since, although it wag
I years since he was employed by the
circus.
The principal mourners were Mr. Philip
Wirth, junr., who flew here today from
Sydney, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Clarke
(daughter and son-in-law), Miss M. Wirth
(daughter), Mr. George Christi®
(nephew), Mr. George Whitrow (.brother**

MR. PHILIP WIRTH
Death in Sydney
FAMOUS SHOWMAN
SYDNEY, Sunday.—Mr. Philip
Wirth, who for many years occupied a
leading position in the circus world of
Australia and abroad, died at his home
in Coogee to-day, at the age of 73. Mr.
Wirth had been associated with the
circus ring from boyhood. His father,
[ Mr. John Wirth, in 1878, organised an
acrobatic and variety troupe of which
Philip Wirth and his brother George
were members. In 1880 the troupe
bought its first tent, and produced its
first show under canvas in Sydney.
George Wirth retired from active;
business in 1930, but Philip continued
his association with the circus until-
as recently as last Easter.
The funeral will be held in Adelaide.f
West and Paterson were again the
shining lights in the Hawera pack, but
Robinson, Malcolm and Willia?ns did
their share.
Sam Cameron was the pick of the
backs. Young Hammond also shaped
well.

1 by Mr. Philip Wirth, sen.,
1 « VPn
and was unique even m cir-
cas history.
Captain Eric Flyger, the lion
trainer, stood by Prince with a whip
in his hand, but Elsie was left with-
out a guardian.
Most of the time she sat with two
inches of her tongue poked out, and
then, seeking some fresh way to show
her disgust with the proceedings,
turned her back on the guests.
Prince was different. His eyes are
too close-set to give a feeling of
friendliness. He showed his dislike
of the constant popping of photo-
graphers’ flashlights by snarling and
glaring at each new explosion.
“Down, Prince !”
Once he stood up on his perch, but
Captain Flyger tapped him on the
nose with his whip and a tense mo-
ment passed.
Spotlights of thousands of candle-
power blazed into the faces of the
lions while movie cameras whirred.
Elsie decided she would not be
photographed any more, and, turning
completely round, gazed with home-
i sickness at her wheeled cage on the
other side of the barred enclosure.
Meanwhile the guests, in awed
silence had got through their
oysters and soup.
Mrs. Philip Wirth, jun., brought a
platter of oysters for Captain Flyger.
Prince thought they were for him
and reached forward. When they
were withdrawn he signalled his dis-
approval by a display of amazingly
large and sharp teeth.
Guests Lose Appetite
Mr. E. Forde, the oldest vaudeville
artist on the Australian stage, who
was sitting directly in front of Prince,
decided he was not hungry any more
and Mr. Eugene Gorman, K.C., on
his right, remembered he was on a
strict diet.
But before the meat dishes were
brought on, Prince became as bored
as Elsie and they were both per-
mitted to retire.
It was remarkable how many funny
stories sprang to the tongues of the
guests as Jessie, the elephant,
dragged the lion’s cage away.

NOTABLE CELEBRATION AT
MELBOURNE.
This year Mr. Philip Wirth, senr.,
celebrated his 60th year as governing
director of Wirth Bros.’ Circus and to
celebrate the occasion he gave a
dinner to many notable persons in the
lions’ den. This is how the “Mel-
bourne Argus” of October 17th
reported the event:
Damocles, sitting at the banquet
of Dionysius with a naked sword sus-
pended above his head by a single hair,
did not have such a bad time, after
all. That, at least, was the opinion of
the 87 free citizens of Melbourne who
accepted the hospitality of Mr. Philip
Wirth, senr., last night, and dined in
a den of lions.
It vras a distinguished party—dis-
tinguished by the' company which
attended it, and distinguished, also,
by the number of persons of high
office who accepted the invitation, but
; decided to be represented, rather than
to dine on the same side of the bars
as a party of live lions of regal bear-
ing.
But the courageous 87 were well
, rewarded. They partook of a banquet
I which would not have shamed even
Dionysius himself. They had good
| company, and they heard witty
speeches. They saw the circus after-
wards, and that in itself was a treat.
They had the pleasure of honouring
Mr. Philip Wirth, senr., on the 60th
anniversary of his office as governing
director of Wirth Bros.’ Circus,
although Mr. Wirth himself was in-
disposed, and was not able to be pre-
sent. They had the distinction of
having assisted at a gathering the
like of which had never been beheld
before —for so it is claimed for the
banquet last night in the lions’ den.
And, not least, after more than 2,000
j years, they had the “low-down” on
I Damocles.
“Some Trepidation.”
J It was noticeable that the first
j guests entered the huge cage with
| some trepidation. It was remarked, too
i that the table reserved for the chief
guests was the table farthest from
the seats where the lions sat, alter-
nately licking their chops and yawn-
ing—the table nearest to the exit
! door. Soon, though, all the seats were
; filled —those next to the lions last of
Sail. Then dinner was served with
some pomp.
That was when the Damocles myth
was exposed. The lions took no more
than polite notice of the fact that the
diners were there, and eating. The
guests were relieved. Damocles must
have experienced the same feeling of
relief when he began his soup, and
observed that the hair held. After
that nothing mattered; the hair might
have been a rope. And the lions
might just as well have been roaring
dragons, so long as they acted as
politely as they did. Out of con-*
sideration for the lions, it appears,
rather than for the diners, they were
invited to re-enter their smaller cage
before the meat course was broUg’ht
on, and a large elephant sedately
hauled them out into the mysterious
background of the circus, amid
applause.
Minister’s Tribute.
One toast, other than that of “The
King,” was honoured. The Minister,
for Customs (Lieut.-Colonel White),
represented the Prime Minister (Mr,
Lyons) and proposed the toast of
the health of Mr. Philip
Wirth, senr., and the company
joined with him in expressing sym-
pathy with him in his illness, and hope
for his speedy recovery. “I gather that
the honour of proposing this toast has
fallen upon me because I am a mem-
ber of the Lyons Ministry,” Lieut.-
Colonel White said, amid laughter. “It
is a pleasure to me to be in the lions’
den; it is a refuge to me, as Minister
for Customs. (Laughter.) I hear such
a lot of growling in my official
capacity that it is a pleasure to
mingle with some lions who have every
right to growl, but don’t. (Renewed
laughter.) It is a pleasure, too, to
honour Mr. Philip Wirth, who has
created this great institution, and
who has always been so ready to place
it at the disposal of soldiers’ dependants
and soldiers’ children, to their great
enjoyment.” (Applause.)
Mr. Philip Wirth, junr., responded
on behalf of his father.
In addition to the menu cards,
tastefully and wittily prepared as
mementoes of the occasion, each
guest bore away with him a bronze
medal, inscribed with his name, to
commemorate the occasion. First,
however, they remained to see the
first performance of Wirth Bros.’ Cir-
cus in its jubilee season in Melbourne,
and they all agreed that the perform-
ance was. worthy of such a notable
occasion.
YOUTH’S FEATS OF
STRENGTH.
RAHMAN KHAN IN ORIENTAL
MYSTERIES.
By FREDERICK H.—U. BOWMAN
Some time ago in the “World’s
Fair” I made reference to Young
Maximo, described as the World’s
Strongest Boy—from Switzerland.
He was identified at that period with
crowd-pulling and incidentally ’bus-
pulling stunts at fair grounds, but I
had never seen him working- on a
stage, so I accepted his pressing in-
vitation to Friary Hall on Armistice
Night, when he was billed with Mons.
,J. Gamon’s International Enter-
tainers.
Young Maximo enters in leopard
skin trunks and a cloak He opens
by turning his back on the audience
and displaying his muscular develop-
ment, which is decidely spectacular.
He does the splits, falling repeatedly
in this difficult position, and then ris-
ing for a little contortion exercise
such as putting one foot behind his
neck. He executes a backward bend,
turns so that he is really looking
behind him, and picks up with his
teeth an object from the stage level.
Feats With Barbell.
I An independent committee
[ selected from the audience is now
I invited up to examine his barbell. This
f weighs 1501bs. Men try to lift it with
very indifferent success. Then Maximo
grasps it with one hand and lifts it
several times high above his head. He
rests the barbell on his shoulders and
drops it thence into his hands, and
on to his forearms. Lying on the
stage, he juggles the heavy objects
with his upturned feet and knees, and
performs a trick which he claims is
unique and dangerous by twirling it
round his loins. A man sits astride on
his shoulders while two others hang
on the barbell, Maximo supporting the
total weight of all. Slowly he turns
in a circle making his burden revolve.
He also bends tested lengths of mild
steel eleven and a half inches by
seven-sixteenths. A single knot in the
middle of a rope is placed round his
neck and six men pull hard, three at
each end till Maximo claps as a
signal for release. It is a sensational
Sight when with muscular tensity
alc.be be resists such powerful con-
striction.
DEATH BITES
HUNT FOR BOY WITH
“POISON FANGS”
(B.U.P. Special Service)
A GREAT hunt is being made in.
Fengtien Province for the
“Adder Boy” of Chuangchow, a,
seven-year-old, whose bite means
death. Four persons have died
after being bitten by the boy,
whom the people of Chuangchow
believe has poison fangs.
/-\RDERS have been given that the
“Adder Boy” must be taken alive
or dead. The boy’s own father had
intended to kill him, after the boy had
bitten three people, all of whom had
died. The father locked the boy in a
cage, but next morning found he had
escaped.
A woodcutter found him in the
forest, and, taking pity on him, took
him to his cabin. The lad bit his
benefactor, who died.
The young killer resembles a young-
ape in appearance. Villagers in "Chu-
angchow district have sworn to kill!

“Killer” Elephant Is
Destroyed
By Poisoned Apple
HrRUMPETING and fighting savagely, the circus
* elephant, which ran amok and killed his
keeper at Parkes, died at midnight last night, three
minutes after having swallowed enough cyanide to
kill 70 men .
•i
i It was administered in the ele-
■' phant’s favorite delicacy, an apple,
' two unpoisoned apples having first
been given to him to gain his con-
fidence.
{ Employees of Perry Bros.’ circus, to
! which the animal was attached re-
! Based the elephant from the massive
( chains by which he had been secured
]to oeos in the Forbes railway yard,
and took him to his truck shortly be-
fore midnight.
The elephant fought every inch of
the way, and when he reached his
truck, lunged heavily against it.
Two sound apples were then given
to him. He swallowed them greedily.
The third apple, which had been
scooped hollow and packed with
three dessertspoons of cyanide, was
proffered by a circus employee lust
before midnight, while Forbes police
stood beside the truck as witnesses.
The elephant accepted it with his
trunk and trumpeting loudly, ate it.
In three minutes he was dead.
Tlie body will be taken into the
nearby scrub and burned.
Tba ele Phant, which was known
as Tom,” was 24 years old.
During the inquest on Jack Stev-
ens, the keeper whom he killed j
in a fit of madness at Parkes on
Tuesday night, it was stated by work-1
mates that the animal had previously
been spiteful, and was likely to be-
come violent under provocation.
Be was imported from Singapore
at the age of eight, and was valued
at between £4OO and £5OO. He was
not a performing animal, but one of
the coolies” used to do work around
the circus.

medium with which to destroy the

TRAGIC SHOOTING OF
THE “FLYING CODONAS”
&
Supreme as Daring Trapeze
Artists
ENGAGED FOR AUSTRALIAN
TOUR
SAN FRANCISCO, July 3).
] Tragedy overtook the world-famous
; “Flying Codonas” today —but not in the
air, as timid onlookers often fearec
they would meet their death some day.
Alfred Codona shot and critically
wounded his estranged wife, Vera
Bruce, aged 31, and then committee
suicide. The Codonas had been booked
to tour Australia.
Alfred had met his wife at her
solicitor’s office to discuss her divorce
suit. The wife had received an inter-
locutory decree on June 28, and today’s
property settlement involved 50,000
dollars (£10,000).
Friends said that Codona broodec
about his inability to perform daring
feats since his fall two years ago.
The shooting occurred in Long Beach
(Caliiornia).
Mrs Codona’s mother was present.
Codona asked the solicitor to leave the
"room. He lit a cigarette and said.
“Vera, I guess this is the last thing 1
can do for you”—and he fired.
BRISBANE, August 1.
Mr R. C. Mannington, advance man-
ager for Wirth Bros’ Circus, who is now
in Brisbane, said last night that the
Codonas had entered into an agreement
to tour Australia and New Zealand
with Wirths’. They were to have
joined the circus in Melbourne in No-
vember, or in New Zealand in that
montl’ After a tour of the Dominion
they were to have been featured
throughout Australia.
“The report of the tragic shooting
will be received with deep regret by
showmen in all parts of the world,” he
said, “because the Flying Codonas
were supreme as daring trapeze artists.
Their daring and their great artistry
knew no bounds.”

GIRAFFES FOR
PAGEL’S CIRCUS.
SURMOUNTING A TRANSPORT
PROBLEM.
When Big - Native Chief Tschekedi
presented Pagel’s Circus of South
Africa with a few giraffes from the
Native Territory, he presented Herr
Pagel at the same time with an out-
size transport problem (states the
December issue of “The Leyland
Journal”).
How does one transport giraffes 355
miles from the wilds of Kalahari, over
roads which consist mostly of deep
dry sand ? To start with, how does one
catch a giraffe, anyhow?
A member of the Leyland service
staff in South Africa can answer the
latter question, because he watched
the process after accompanying a big
Leyland Terrier, Herr Pagel’s answer
to the first question, to Serowe, 355
miles away.
Excited natives slung a 400 ft. rope
across a number of trees, 10 ft. from
the ground, and, forming a horse-shoe,
forced the animal with wild cries,
stamping and beating the surrounding
bush, into the rope. The Leyland man
has not reported why the giraffe did
not step under the rope, but it
evidently did not occur to it, because
a few minutes later hobbled and with
a noose slung round his neck, he was
being enticed slowly into a box, and
similar strategy ended in the downfall
of his fellows. The box was specially
constructed for the purpose, just big
enough to take the beasts and small
enough to stop them moving about,
lying down, or kicking it to pieces.
Standing Only.
Once the giraffes were safely
aboard, the troubles of the Terrier’s
crew were by no means over. The out-
ward trip had been difficult enough,
necessitating the use of second gear
for most of the way to cope with
the deep dry sand of the route, and the
last thirty-mile stretch had taken 5h
hours and absorbed fuel oil at the rate
of 3.5 m.p.g., although the average for
the round 710 mile trip was 8.25 m.p.g.
The return was complicated by the
necessity of making a practically non-
stop run, since the giraffes were
standing the whole way and became,
quite pardonably, unduly impatient
whenever the engine was stopped.
Twenty-six hours saw the second half
of the run completed, and the period
w'ould have been shorter if it had not
been necessary, every time telegraph
wires crossed a section of the route, to
stop and lift the wires over the
animals’ heads. This was a job for the
native “look-out,” occupying a lofty
perch at the top of the box.
Pagel’s Terrier was not blazing any
new trail on this run, because the
South African Railway’s Leyland
Terriers regularly cover some 130
miles of the route, but they are able
to utilise bridges, which the height of
the giraffes made impossible. Ford-
ing rivers proved no handicap, since in
everv case but one they were dried up.

SHOWMAN BORN.
Wirth of the Big Tent.
SAWDUST AND ROMANCE.
By J. R. W. Taylor.
To be a circus performer and defy
death in tights and spangles has
been the dream of generations of boys,
the world over. Even in this sophis-
ticated age, the “big tents,” which dome
the magic sawdust rings, stir the ima-
gination of healthy youth as no cinema
or theatre can ever do.
The blare of music, the roar of lions,
the thrills of the high trapeze, the
mummery of clowns, the mastery of
wild beasts—all these appeal as strongly
as ever to the romantic in us, and
make the heart beat faster.
It was the happy fate of Philip Wirth that
his boyhood dreams should be realised, and
end only with death. The love of showman-
ship was born in him, and he shared with
his talented brothers and sisters an inherited
zest for the open road and the excitements
of a circus life. His father, John Wirth, was
himself an adventurer in the heroic sense of
the term, and never allowed his private quest
for fortune to subdue his passion for music.
Philip, too, was a musician of parts, but
from his earliest years found time for other
accomplishments. He trained himself to be
an acrobat, a clown, a horseman, a tent-
maker, and a business manager of uncommon
acumen. Though of heavy build, and accus-
tomed to “rough it,” he was a sensitive lad,
with a keen sense of pride. Thus, in the old
sideshow days, when he was appearing with
a partner billed as “Como the Jap,” his bro-
ther John humprously informed the audience
on one occasion that there would be a comic
stilt act by the “Crummy Brothers.”
This so offended Philip that he took off his
stilts and refused to go in, with the result
that John paid forfeit by becoming one of
the “Crummy Brothers” on the spot!
Work and Drama.
The genesis of that notable circus, which
the hoardings eventually proclaimed to be the
“Greatest Show on Earth,” was sheer hard
work, allied to pluck and imagination. Philip
and the other members of the Wirth family
practised every moment of the day, taking
falls and bruises as the inevitable penalties
of perfection, and having no teachers but
their own grit and perseverance.
They discovered that trick riding was the
hardest and most dangerous lesson of all,
notwithstanding that in the eyes of the.
audience it was not nearly so thrilling as ■
feats on the flying trapeze. The latter, t
according to Philip, can be performed in a
few weeks, whereas it requires months, and
sometimes years, to conquer the art of somer-
saulting, pirouetting, or jumping through a
hoop from a horse’s back.
Philip Wirth’s career was packed with in-
cident and drama from that auspicious night
in the eighties when the family presented its
first full circus to the people of Ararat.
Fighting against competition, sudden storms,
which levelled and tore the canvas, and the
innumerable vicissitudes that beset a travel-
ling show, the circus thrived as the years went
on, and opposition melted away.
Once, however, it narrowly escaped being
the scene of a major tragedy. That was
on January 23, 1894, during a performance
at Fillis’s Amphitheatre, in Johannesburg.
As part of the “Wild West” programme, a
“settler’s hut” was set on fire, but, to every-
body’s consternation, the flames spread to
the decorative curtains in the dome, 70 feet
above the arena. The audience promptly took
fright and rose in horror to its feet.
Realising that the fate of the building was
in the balance, and that a stampede was likely
at any moment, George Wirth and an assist-
ant, Edward Murphy, “shinned up” ropes and
poles among the blazing fabric, beat the fire
with their gloved hands, and tore the burning
rags from the rafters.
Fascinated by the spectacle, the spectators
forgot their panic, and cheered. Philip and
other members of the troupe had meanwhile
led out the horses and other animals, and
concentrated upon calming the general excite-
ment. Many human lives were undoubtedly
saved that evening.
In Foreign Parts.
There was scarcely a country in the world
that Philip Wirth did not visit with the cir-
cus, but it was in South America that he and
his brothers came to the conclusion that their
show was not all glamour and success. They
got into trouble with the authorities for al-
lowing their Zulu performers to go about in
their native costumes —that is, almost naked
—and the Zulus created even more trouble
by disappearing into the void, rather than
wear trousers and boots.
Next, a theatre in which were stored all
the wardrobe, harness, and paraphernalia of
the show was burnt to the ground, and, as
if this were not enough, there were difficul-
ties in other places with swindling interpre-
ters and contractors, and fights, in and out
of season, with swashbuckling members of the
public.
Wirth’s was the first Australian circus to
tour Britain, or any foreign country, and its
visit happened at a time when powerful rivals
were in the field —Lord George Sanger, Lord
John Sanger, Claud Genette, and several
others, all of whom were then at the height
of their glory. But the season was a triumph
from several points of view, and was graced by
the patronage of the Prince of Wales, after-
wards King Edward the Seventh. It seemed
even more triumphal in retrospect, for, only
a little later, the circus had to flee to the
Orient from South Africa on the outbreak
of the Boer War.
Philip Wirth was always in agreement with
his brother George that there was no place
in the world where the physique could be so
strongly developed and the mind so broadened
as under the “big tents” of a travelling circus.
He invariably proclaimed that circus folk,
everywhere, were the most morally clean, the
happiest, and the healthiest. His life, ac-
cordingly, was not only the one of his chr ->
' but congenial to his taste and nature, an,
enthusiasm endured to the last.
The “Greatest Show on Earth” was not,m*
course, the first circus to play before
Australian public. The first of importance
was Cooke, Zoyara, and Wilson’s “Great World
Circus,” which astonished the citizens of Mel-
bourne and Sydney in 1866, and this was fol-
j lowed in later times by Cooper and Bailey’s
circus, Ashton’s circus, Hiscox and Watkin’s
“Royal Tycoon Circus,” Charini’s, Sells’s, and
Fitzgerald Brothers’ circuses. The last was
contemporaneous with Wirth’s, and even
sionally excelled it in vonderr, but of ’ the
all only the “Gre.'*v'st Show on Earth” n r
THE CIRCUS IN
RETROSPECT.
FROM ASTLEY’S TO THE
GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.
By "SOUTHDOWN ”
I remember someone once describ-
ing a circus as a circular arena of
fourteen yards nine inches in
diameter, surrounded by benches.
That was no doubt because fourteen
yards nine inches was the regulation
size, the unvarying dimensions of the
area responding to a more or less
double necessity, the exigency of the
man and the exigency of the animal.
Among the ancient Romans, how-
ever, the circus was a kind of amphi-
theatre adopted for horse-races, the
exhibition of athletic exercises and
contests with wild beasts, but eques-
trian performances such as we now
understand by the term are different;
they are scarcely two centuries old
in England. It is, however, true that
manuscripts of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries give us repre-
sentations of the feats of clever
horses such as gambolling on their
hind legs to the sound of pipe and
tabor, or dancing on the tight rope,
while Banks’s dancing horse to which
I recently made reference in this
journal has obtained immortality
through Shakespeare’s mention of it
in “Love’s Labour Lost.”
In Queen Anne’s reign a horse was
exhibited on Tower Hill which could
fetch and carry and execute other
curious tricks, and a French author
records a grand ballet dance upon
managed horses, executed before
Louis XIII. at a court festival which
in all probability was the first com-
mand performance in connection with
any item presented, in the sawdust
ring. It was not however before the
latter half of the eighteenth century
that we find the circus proper. In
1767 equestrian performances were
given in a tea garden at Islington, a
district which is still rich for its cir-
cus associations.
Two Kinds of Circuses.
It may be well to explain that at
one period there were two distinct
kinds of circuses, firstly those that
performed in permanent buildings
only and those that “tented” in the
spring and summer, and occupied
buildings in the winter. Of the first
kind there was in this country in the
year 1879 five companies, namely,
Keith’s, Cooke’s, Hengler’s, New-
some’s and Adams’s. Of the other
class there were eight recognised
shows, their proprietors being Messrs.
Sanger, Myers, Pinder, Batty, Powell
and Clarke, F. Ginnett, G. Ginnett and
Swallow.
Yet another firm to tour the United
Kingdom about this period was one
which hailed from America, Messrs.
Howes and Cushing, who went into
the business in a wholesale manner.
Their company had been so greatly
increased in strength that it had been
divided first into two distinct com-
panies, then into three, and ultimately'
there were four American companies
belonging to this single proprietary
competing keenly, for popular sup-
port against British circuses.
Philip Astley.
But to return to 1767. About that
time one Philip Astley formed a ring
with rope and stakes in a field in
Lambeth from which he moved to the
site of the amphitheatre near West-
minster Bridge, establishing there a
circus only partially covered in.
Astley had learned some feats of
horsemanship while serving in the
army where he had distinguished him-
self by the capture of a standard at
the battle of Emsdorff. On obtaining
his discharge he was presented by his
general with a horse with which, to-
gether with a purchase of his own, he
commenced a form of amusement
which to a very late date, was almost
exclusively associated with his name.
He died in 1814, with the reputation
of being the best horse-breaker and
trainer of his time.
Old Bills.
In connection with the early shows
a Mr. Frost whose book was pub-
lished some sixty-five years ago gives
some amusing specimens of early
play-bills which are remarkable for
their personal allusions to rival estab-
lishments. Thus the proprietor of The
|Royal Circus, opened in 1783 in
Blackfriars Road, after thanking his
patrons for their support, acquaints
them that his antagonist “has caught
a cold so near to Westminster
B: e, and for his recovery is gone
to a warmer climate, which is Bath,
in Somersetshire. He boasts, poor
fellow, no more of activity, and is
now turned conjurer.’' In another bill
of the same establishment “Hughes
has the honour to inform the nobility
that he has no intention of setting out
every day to France for three follow-
ing seasons, his ambition being fully
satisfied by the applause he has
received from foreign gentlemen who
came over the sea to see him.” The
same Hughes “rides at full speed
with his right foot in the saddle and
his left toe in his mouth, two surpris-
ing feet.”
A newspaper of this period (1788)
reads strangely as it remarks of Sad-
ler’s Wells Theatre that it is the only
place of amusement at which “A man
may if he chooses get drunk. A pint
of liquor is included in the price of
admittance, but as much more may
be had as any person chooses to call
for. This is not permitted at Astley’s
the Circus, or the Royalty.”
Distinguished Performers.
Mr. Frost also tells us other cir-
cuses were subsequently established
on the sites of the Olympic and Prince
of Wales Theatres. Astley’s mean-
time attained a notoriety among all
classes.
Among the females to distinguish
themselves at Astley’s w r as Adah
Menken, an American of Jewish
extraction who wrote poetry and
translated the Gliad w r hen she was in
her early teens, and was proficient in
the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Spanish, and
German languages. Coming to this
country with a high reputation as an
actress she created some sensation at
Astley’s by appearing as Mazeppa,
strapped on a wild horse. During her
stay in England she brought out a
volume of poems, dedicated by per-
mission to Dickens. She had been
married to Heenan, the pugilist, for
some years previously to her death
which occurred in Paris. Lulu was
another lady who had commenced
public life at the Alhambra as a boy
on the trapeze, her sex being unknown
even to her fellow performers. She
was subsequently famed for her
execution of the triple somersault, and
a vertical spring of 25 feet from the
ring fence.
The Greatest Show on Earth.
At the beginning of the 19 th
century circuses began to travel. They
were on a very limited scale; their
stud consisted of only three or four
horses, nor did they always boast even
of a tent. One of these circuses
(Bannister’s) when located in
Edinburgh obtained the services of
David Roberts, the future Royal
Academician, who at a salary of 255.
a week was engaged to travel with the
circus as its scene painter. It is indeed
interesting to contrast these early
shows with the mammoth tenting
circuses of America such as Barnum’s
World’s Fair with which he took the
field in 1873. The transport of this
show which comprised 1,000 men, 500
horses, 1,500 wild beasts, and rare
birds, required 150 railway cars. Its
daily expenses were 6,800 dollars; the
show contained three rings and could
accommodate 14,000 spectators.
The great street procession which
paraded the town each day was nearly
three miles long. The museum depart-
ment, besides its hundreds of
curiosities, included a national portrait
gallery, and a collection of classic
statuary. Tickets for the show could
be issued by the lightning ticket-seller
at the rate of 6,000 per hour. The side
shows were run under independant
management, large bonuses being
given by their proprietors for the
privilege of accompanying the main
circus. The side shows consisted of
animals with a superabundance of
limbs, living skeletons, Daniel
Lambert’s or pig-faced ladies; or of a
minstrel performance, which
immediately followed the principal
entertainment.
Menagerie.
In concluding this peep at the early
history of the circus it may not be out
of place to mention menageries, since
nov/adays no circus is considered quite
complete without its collection of wild
animals. The earliest travelling
menageries were those of Wombwell
and Atkins, which were formed at the
beginning of the 19th century. Of
Wombwell we read that one year, on
the occasion of Bartlemy Fair, he
travelled to London from the north and
one elephant died on the journey.
Atkins, a rival showman, forthwith
placarded his canvas with the
announcement that he had “the only
live elephant in the fair,” whereupon
Wombwell, not to be out done, per ?
his show front with the words, pill
only dead elephant in the
elephants had been seen buy
had seen a dead one and com
Wombwell’s show was crowded.
The Trainers.
It is difficult to see how man would
have fared if he had not compelled the
animals to serve him. The science of
animal training must therefore date
back to the earliest stages of the
world’s history, and we may believe
that artistic training is almost as old.
In regard to the training of wild
animals Wombwell had a lion trainer
on his show before Van Amburgh
appeared, but the latter is generally
credited with the honour of having
introduced the art of lion training into
England. The Duke of Wellington
once asked him if he was ever afraid.
Van Amburgh replied, “The first time
that I am afraid, your Grace, or that
I fancy my pupils are afraid of me I
shall retire from the wild-beast line.”
The strength of Van Amburgh’s com-
pany was two lions and a lioness, a
couple of tigers and half-a-dozen
leopards. The leopards would spring
upon their master’s shoulders or,
spreading themselves on the ground,
form pillows for his head.

Ruined By
Money They
Never Had
YyHILE pulling down an old house
to make way for a modern
boulevard in Tirana, Albania, sur-
prised workmen recently dis-
covered two heavy canvas bags,
each containing 50,000 gold louis, or
a total of nearly £lOO,OOO. .
Authorities who investigated the iind
traced it back for several years, and un-
covered a most unusual story in con-
nection with it.
The money proved to be the long-lost
fortune of Ahmed Riza, and because of
its clever concealment in a built-in safe
in the thick wall of the dwelling, a
once happy family had been wiped out.
Fifteen years ago, Ahmed Riza, a
wealthy Tirana merchant, was cele-
brating" the wedding of his daughter
Rezina. To his son-in-law, Azaga, the
hanny father had made a promise of
50,000 gold louis as a dowry to be
handed over after the wedding cere-
mony.
But as the large party of guests,
mounted on horses in the traditional
manner, made its way from the mosque
after the wedding, the bride’s father fell
from his horse and broke his neck. He
died without regaining consciousness.
VAIN SEARCH
The hiding place of the huge dowry,
which was a personal secret of Ahmed
Riza, went with him to the grave, and
his family tried in vain after his death
to find it by digging up the garden,
ripping up the floors, and tapping walls.
His son-in-law, who had entered into
heavy business commitments, banking
on \the large sum promised to him,
went bankrupt soon afterwards, and
committed suicide.
Overwhelmed by the tragedy, his
young wife went insane. Her brother
was reduced to begging in the streeid
after the collapse of the business enter-
prise, and died of starvation.
When the authorities opened the long
missing bags of gold, they found that
Ahmed Riza had every intention of
carrying out his promises.


NEW CIRCUS LAUNCHED
;MAJOR CONDER
NTERESTED
V ENTERPRISE
"DNEY, To-day.—Major
Conder, formerly
manager of the Aus-
tralian Broadcasting Com-
mission, is associated with
the launching of a new
circus venture in Australia.
KNOWN as Ivan Brothers, the new
circus will tour all Australian cities
as a rival of Wirth Brothers, who
at present hold a virtual monopoly
of the “big circus” business in Australia.
No announcement has yet been made
of the location or opening date of the
new circus, but the arrival by the Makura
10-day of several headline circus acts
from America indi-
cates that the day
is not far distant.
These acts, it is
understood, will be
the only imported
acts on the opening
bill, the remainder
of which will be
recruited from the
cfrcu6 talent already
in Australia. Ac-
cording to the
management, many
splendid circus per-
formers in Aus-
tralia are awaiting
an opportunity.
Major Conder
With the exception of one artist, 1
Mrs. Dutton, all of the 22 performers
who arrived on the Makura are new-
comers to this country.
Mrs. Dutton has visited Australia twice
—once as a child in 1897 when her parents
staged the fan.:us “Flying Jordans” act
<tt the principal capitals, and later in 1899
her father, Lewis Jordan, established a
huge three-ring circus on the American
The tent was pitched on the site
where the Redfevn railway now
stands —then an open paddock, -f j -
“ Hoodoo Show’ ’
, “Although I was only a kid of eight,”
Mrs. Dutton said to-day, “I remember
that the enterprise was disastrous. Bad
luck dogged Dad every way, and he lost
v.ractieafiy all he had. Mother had a
terrible fall during the act, and there were
other accidents. It was a hoodoo show.”
In 1911 Mrs. Dutton again visited Aus-
tralia, this time as Nellie Jordan, a fully
: hedged trapeze artist in the “Flying Jor-
dans” act, being the one who was thrown
l through..,space from one performer to the
other. «*&*,
g Now. she is a bareback equestrienne.
’ .h age forced her parents to give up
their act. U ... married Jimmie Dutton
and starved all over again to learn bare-
back riding.
The other a/ which arrived were
j Dannv Mitchell, famous American circus
j clown; the Delcos, a high trapeze and
aerial act; and the Demrati Arabs, acro-
\ bats and tumblers.
t The Duttons brought with them three
| intelligent horses, which are used in their
• act. These and Mrs. Dutton’s pet Pome-
ranian will, of coifrse, have to spend the
required term in quarantine.

Judge
Mabeckhi Mayeba, Orien-
tal juggler, yesterday enter-
jtained Judge Betts in the Dis-
trict Court.
TXE juggled—with English.
- LJ - Mayeba was called as a witness in
a case in which Aage Rasmussen,
circus acrobat, claimed £2OO from a
circus manager for an alleged kick
in the face.
The defendant, George Christie, of
Wirths’ Circus, denied the assault.
He said that Rasmussen rushed at
i him and he put his foot out in self-
defence.
The incident occurred on a circus
train in Auckland, N.Z., on March
, 12.
“No Excited—Yes!”
Mayeba’s version went like this:
“Lasmussen, he in the train corri-
dor waving paper.
“Chlistie no sign yes. Chlistie his
face red.
“ N P exci ted yes. Lasmussen say,
Shut your mouthful,' and jump out
of carriage.”
“He step quick, very fast. Chlistie ,
stick out the foot.
“Lasmussen he push the face on
XU.
The Judge: We should have made
a talkie of this.
Humphrey, called for the
plaintiff, said that the nerves of the
acrobat’s face had been damaged.
Claim Fails
When flying through the air in his
act he couldn’t feel the wind on his
face, and so lost his sense of speed
The Judge found for defendant
Mr A. B Kerrigan (by S. E. Cook
and Son) for plaintiff; Mr. J. w
Shand (by McPadden and McFad-
den) for defendant.

of condemned beer emptied into the dry bed of the Leichhara t

had an orgy. »
The lorry which took the condemned;;
liquor out of town was followed by a i
speculative crowd, and others met it at
the river bank.
They were well supplied with billy-
cans and kerosene tins.
But the excise officer, after tasting !
the spouting cascade, pronounced it !
unfit for human consumption.
A delegate came forward, an eminent
connoisseur, and asked if he could taste ■
it-
He was allowed to do so. Anxious
eyes watched his face.
Rescuing The Milk !
He said: “It’s more sour than
Grundy’s breath.” f
Later 120 goats came along.
They imbibed.
Within an hour, those of the mob l
that were not asleep were fighting.
Then their owners dragged them, home.

Parkes, Wednesday.
A sensational occurrence
took place late last night
when Jack Brummett (54),
circus attendant, was attack-
ed by an elephant after the
performance of Perry Bros.’
circus.
Bmmmett was leading the ani-
mal in ni a vacant allotment w hen
the elephant forced him to the
ground with its' saw n off tusks and
with its head. Uruimnett’s' ribs,
arms, legs and skull were crushed,
and he died while being conveyed
to hospital.
People in the vicinity were chased
h.v the animal. Some ran into houses,
while nearly .‘lOO took refuse in a hotel
The elephant then rushed at a motor
truck and dragged it about 50 yards,
trying to smash it to pieces.
Eventually a member of the circus
party and other attendants, accom-
panied by two old female elephants,
persuaded the distracted elephant to
enter its barred cage.
It was decided by the police to shoot
the animal.
Altogether the elephant took posses-
sion of the main street for about two
hours.

“THE SHOW GOES ON’
TRAPEZE ARTIST’S
FATAL FALL
THE shadow of the “BE Top
loomed for a while over the
City Coroner’s Court last week
Mr. E. T. Oram sat to inquire
how August Mohwald, 20, “a com-
petent performer, an excellent per-
former, a - first-class performer,”
had met his death as a trapeze ar-
tist while “mowing at Wirth’ Cir-
cus at Narrandera recently.
“He was apprenticed to me + or the
first four years,” recalled Erwin Mut-
mel, himself an acrobat up >n t e
swinging bars above the saw-dusted
arena. “He was twenty and born at
Dusseldorf, Germany. He was a
trapeze artist all his life.
“About 9 p.m. he was doing a comedy
act with another artist named Takacs.
He took off to do a somersault-and-
catch with Takacs and he missed—
fell head-first into the net. He rolled
over and said, ‘Well, I am done this
time!’
“He was a competent perfo • ?
excellent performer, a first-clas.- p*

man’s fellow artist.
“It was terribly hot,” recalled San:’or

ELEPHANT ESCAPES
FROM CIRCUS
Puts Head Through Window of
Shop Before Capture
Sunday. In Stanley
Street, South Brisbane, last night,
Topsy, an elephant of 60, broke away
from a circus and
wandered in the
direction of the
city, greatly to the
astonishment of j
motor ists and j
pedestrians.
When chased byj
attendants the ele
phant ran across i
the road and
pushed her head
through the plate glass window of
a shop.
Before she could do further
damage, Topsy was secured and led
back to her tent.


Nor did we —that is, from the time it heard the music to which it was
accustomed to parade—have any further trouble with it.
Through the difficulty, if not impossibility, of insuring animals we
have sustained very severe losses. Among these were the seals brought
by Captain Huling from America and bought by us from him in Australia.
The whole five died in Adelaide one morning through the excessive heat!
We have had as many as eight elephants. Five is the number we have at
the present time. We have lost from six to seven, without recovering—as
in the case of the seals —anything in insurance.
The herd with which we are now performing includes Princess Alice,
who has something in the way of a history.
She was the mate of the celebrated Jumbo in the London ’Zoo.
Jumbo would not go anywhere without her. When he was sold to Barnum
for America the ’Zoo authorities took Alice along with him to the boat.
Jumbo followed Alice aboard. After he had been secured Alice was led
off again. The ruse was resorted to because it was the only means by
which Jumbo could be shipped away.
King Edward when a boy used to ride Alice.
The separation of Jumbo and Alice led to quite an outcry in England.
Songs were written and sung respecting the evident cruelty of it. Alice
herself became very moody, with the result that the ’Zoo, fearing she
would die, accepted the offer of an enterprising showman —Bostock. Such,
then, were the circumstances in which she was bought by Bostock. He
brought her to Australia, and from him she passed to us.
Alice is credibly reputed to be 210 years old. But this is nothing for
an elephant. Once when in Java I saw an elephant that was known to
he twice that age.
Despite her years Alice is still a very active performer. Further, she
serves the useful purpose with us of keeping the other elephants in
order. She is ever on the alert as to their good behaviour, and when a
little physical punishment is deemed necessary she does not hesitate to
administer it —a matter she seems to be singularly capable of doing. Con-
flicting reports have been published as to the fate of Jumbo in America.
Some state that he was killed in a railway accident. Others declare that
he became so vicious, evidently through the absence of Alice, that he
had to be shot.
To-day in addition to our horses, performing animals, and menagerie
we carry fifty artists, together with a hundred hands —from the managerial
staff to the attendants generally. The size of the show may he still bet-
ter gauged by the fact that for the tour of New South Wales which will
follow our Sydney season we shall have to engage for three months two
special trains to take us from town to town.
1880 to 1920!
Consequently we are in the forty-first year from that in which we first
started in Sydney. The show has been a continuous, going concern all
that time. But we have not confined ourselves wholly to Australia. We
were in Africa for two years; South America, eighteen months; and Eng-
land, two years. From England we went back to Africa. But this time
we had to hurriedly leave there through the outbreak of the Boer war.
From Africa we played India, China, and Japan. Returning to Australia
in 1892 we have been here ever since.
J*
Plainly there is nothing in the amusement line to compare with a
circus in being the sport of the elements.
I could in this respect relate many harrowing experiences. But the
wor l(i — as Thomas Hardy phrased it—has a way of getting used to things.
Certain it is that, to give this an individual application, we have come to
take anything climatically as a mere matter of course. We have had to
miss Narrabri (N.S.W.) three seasons running because of bad weather.
Not so much do we mind the rain, or the resultant sodden state of the
ground.
It is the winds that beat us —the blow that simply defies you to erect
your canvas, or tears it to pieces if you do contrive to get it up.
Rain, however, involves the somewhat minor trouble of making your
tent-hands discontented. But where these refuse to work —or leave you —
we call on the artists and the members of the band. There is always a
ready response on their part in any such emergency. In addition we have
at our command the boys in every town. Hundreds are eager to assist,
—in return, of course, for a free pass; and a team of twenty to twenty-five
of these can give you most appreciable service.
Needless to say they are not there when it comes to pulling down
the tent!
I could dilate for a day on the star circus acts seen by me in Australia
during the long period I have been in the business. But even then this
enumeration would not be complete—or fair.
Take tumblers, for example. There have been so many of these,
equally excellent in the direction in which they specialised. Coma, the
Japanese we had with us when we were boys, has never been surpassed
as a flip-flap thrower. By this I mean a man who works from his feet
to his hands and back from his hands to feet. He threw flip-flaps so
fast that he looked like a wheel. Then there was Chilie Gonsalez, who
was similarly the limit in cross-tricks and high somersaults.
And so I might go on.
I can add, however, that the greatest triple horizontal bar performer I
have ever seen was a man named Mora, who was with us in England. He
never came to Australia. Among horsemen I give pride of place to John
Welby Cooke, who for many years has been —and still is—a member of
our combination. But even he had his superior in May Wirth. In this
comparison I make no allowance for sex. American and English opinion
is with me when I say that she is probably the best rider the world has
ever seen. ,
Would I with my forty odd years’ experience to guide me go through
it all again? Yes.
Not in the sense of taking up the circus as a commercial speculation.
It is one of the riskiest of ventures, viewed from a money-making stand-
point. We have been very fortunate. With us there may be fluctuating
periods. But since we years ago attained the status we continue to hold
our position financially has always been assured. What attracts me is
the pleasure the life brings with it. Joy begets joy—the joy we give others
having, so to speak, its counterpart in the joy we thus come to feel
ourselves.
Perhaps to others it may not sound much. But to us there is a fur-
ther comforting reflection. This is that as Australians, catering for Aus-
tralians, we have ever striven to leave behind us a clean and honored
name, and thus in our own small way lend respect and dignity to those
whose calling it is to make brighter and happier the lot of their fellow-
creatures. /v

When a letter comes home from the boy.
How to hide her emotion all vainly she tries,
As she forces a smile to her tear-bedimmed eyes.
Does she guess what within that plain envelope lies ?
Is it sorrow, or comfort, or joy?
With a tenderness no one blit she can command,
She opens the seal with a tremulous hand,
And those few pencilled lines from a war-stricken land,
As she reads, what she feels we but half understand
When a letter comes home from the boy.
' FATHER.
There’s a feeling of pride about duty that’s done
When a letter comes home from the boy.
And a grim sort of hope that a well-beloved son,
Tho ; the work to his hand is but barely begun,
May keep well through it all till the vict’ry is won,
And return home the fruit? to enjoy.
There’s a pang of regret that ambition and greed,
Running loose in the world should create such a need.
That our sons leave their homes war’s great hunger to feed,
Just for what? There’s the rub! Still, there’s solace
indeed
When a letter comes home from the boy.
WIFE OR SWEETHEART.
There’s a rift in the clouds, and the sun seems to shine
When a letter comes home from the boy.
How she searches the wording of every line,
Hopes are mingled with fears as she looks for a sign.
Is there something concealed which she cannot define ?
Terse expressions he seems to employ.
Not the old-time love-letters she used to receive,
Nor containing a thought over which she need grieve,
Just a soldier’s brief, message her mind to relieve,
Reaches many a brave-hearted girl I believe,
When a letter comes home from the boy.
THE BOY.
“ Over there,” anywhere, when the mail-bags appear
With a letter from home for the boy.
As tlhe call of his name strikes his listening ear,
There’s a click in his throat and his sight isn’t clear,
For his far-away Home seems just then very near,
And the foe has no power to annoy.
Watch the look on his face as he’s reading it through,
See his chums gather round, perhaps they’ll read it, too
It’s a letter from “ Blighty,” and letters are few;
Oh, you little imagine the good you may do
With a letter from Home to the Boy.
—E. G. Beckett in Lincoln Chronicle.
The Wizard of the Wire
QOLLEANO’S dancing
on the slack wire at
Fullers’ Theatre (Sydney)
is the prettiest thing to
watch.
His small feet twinkle
gracefully in pirouette and
entre-chat, alighting al-
ways on the wire with an
effortless sureness that dis-
guises the difficulty of the
act. A silver thread to
match the silvei posts
would enhance the general
effect. The black wire is
partly lost against the dark
green of the painted drop
scene.
Colleano’s dressing is
admirable. His slim figure
and almost Italian dark-
ness of face and hair are
fittingly set off by the
white satin suit.
Colleano —his Christian
name is William—is ar,
Australian. He spent sev-
eral years in the back-
blocks perfecting his act,
wisely refusing a number
of offers to come city-
wards until he was able
to present something which
could compete with—if not
surpass—headliners from
over-seas.
His forward somersault
is his star feat.
He explains that the
danger lies in the fact that
his feet, coming over his
head, usually obscure his
view of the wire, and he
has to land in mid-air
without seeing his objec-
tive. He has had a slow
moving-picture made of
the somersault so that the
public may realise the sig-
nificance of it.
Colleano’s performances
generally would grace any
vaudeville bill in the
world.
Names that are recalled
by the work of Colleano
are Mademoiselle Yetta,
La Belle Victoria, Hugh P.
Lloyd, and Paul Gorden—
world performers on the
wire, the lot of them.
Gorden’s billing was “The
drunk on the wire.”
’Tis gratifying to think
that in Colleano Australia
has produced a wire-
walker right abreast with
this galaxy of stars.
BABY RHINO, which arrived from South Africa by the Medic
yesterday to join Wirth’s menagerie was so tame that the South African
children made a playmate of him, and loved his very ugliness.

WIRTH BROS. CIRCUS.
OPENS AT KALGOORLIE.
A MAGNIFICENT SHOW
The great tent of Mirth Bros.*
Circus and menagerie erected on
the Commonwealth grounds, Kal-
goorlie, surged with thousands of
amazed spectators last night when
the performance that has elevated
the combination to the forefront rf
Australian entertainments was
given in all its varied detail. Every-
thing tbit tradition demands of the
circus was there, and it wak all won-
derful and pleasing to the ycurg
and old who have been dcni.'d the
privilege of this most popular
amusement for such a long period
The menagerie, the first tent vb.t-
ed, is a perfect wonderland.. Within
a confined space arc gathered a con-
gress of wild beasts from almost,
every section of the world. From
the farthest north to the farthest
south, from the hot lands ot U*c
equator, from the most remote dis-
tricts of India, Asia, arc gathered
together the quaintest of animal re-
presentatives presenting a hook .J
natural history,illustrated', not. with
pictures but with living beasts.
Long, before the circus opened with
its never ending stream of thrills,
the menagerie provided half hour
of complete enjoyment to hundreds
of people, who passed the big line
of dens in awed wonder,
In the main circus tent the perfect
equipment was an attractive fea-
ture. Uniformed attendants were
everywhere watching the interests
and comfort of the patrons, and
when the grand ptarade of the entire
circus talent led off round the arena
practically every seat and chair was
occupied by an expectant patron.
Years of experience had brought
with it many features pleasing to an
audience, and not for a moment did
the show flag. It was a continuous
stream of events, the last appearing
to almost eclipse the first, and all
earning the responsive reward that
merit demands. Succeeding the
w-and {Tirade, with its picturesque
: ses and riders, massive but gentle
’elephants, draped with gaudy rugs,
wa.s an introduction by the ring-
master of “Lizzie."the enormous Af-
rican blood-sweating hippopotamus,
and the gentle female who nad been
a. subject of unabtated interest in
the menagerie tent. The most
distinctive item at the opening was
M. M ussa Mamiev, a Russian Cos-
link, whose skilful and daring horse-
manship. while baffling description,
commands that admiration which
goes with courage. Perhaps it
would be more easy to name a
position he failed to hike in his
many ways of riding. In a re-
markable exhibition of his native
equestrianism M. Mamiev conveyed
an (idea of the incompar-
able horsemanship now being
practised on Polish battlefields,
and which has struck fear into the
hearts of jhe troops of the Kaiser.
He was, as is usually said of the
Cossack, born in the saddle, and
would even now be fighting along-
ide his brother Russians were he
not exempt from military service
by the fact of his being the only
son and support of His mother. He
displays perfect ease at-riding and
a masterful influence over the ani-
mal. man and beast acting in the
utmost h-armonj. ’ Maximo, the.
Cuban wonder, revolutionised the
art of slack wbe Walking. In r-
protended state of intoxication he
behaved in an acrobatic manner that
an ordinary—and sober-mortal
would find difficulty in emulating
with a few million tons of earth
as his support, and not a wire rope.
With all his endeavour to
one of those fabled cluibites who
attach themselves to lamp posts at,
the “witching hour,’’ he walked a
straighter line than - any of the lat-
ter have been known to accomplish
when in their best. form. Maximo
was accorded a rousing reception,
and left an entirely new impression
regarding the tight-rope art. Fol-
lowing in order of (merit Were
Wozzen’s Bedouin Arabs, who. it is
said, are direct from Genoa. There
are eleven in the troupe, and they
are natural born acrobats, gifted
•with strength that might well be
envied. The agility wa,s remark-
able. Alt were equal in point of
ability with the exception of the
leader a powerful Arab, who accom-
modated the whole ten others formed
in pyramid groupings around him.
Throughout the remaining act his
was also detected and
comm r ntpfl upon. Madaroe
fcßrrzao is billed on the programme
■F “The millionaire lady horse-
f rainer, who educates hotses for a
hobby, and will give £5! to any
human being who can s-and tw*
minutes upon the revolving table
upon which her ponies perform.”
Whether she is n milliotairess or
not, the faet remains fh.tt- no per-
son did retain his equilib’im on the
tabic, which the graceful little pony
rode with ease. Her string of ponies
I and a stubborn mule Tore an in-
teresting addition to the pro-
, gramme, and Madame was loudly
applauded for her graceful act,
while the laughter that at tended
the . attempt of five assistants to
j catch the mule, whose persistent
obstinacy was characteristic of his
i species, was evidence of its merit.
| The Ha-ssans* two girls and a man,
in their wire walking performance,
arc distinct from that of Maximo.
Tt consists chiefly of alarming cycle
and motor-cycle trick work on a
tight wire twenty feet from the
ground. They ai> direct from Paris,
and the national French melodies bv
the band gav c a fascinating atmos-
phere to a daring and clever
act. Many of the achievements
looked almost impossible, but
were accomplished with an ease,
that was remarkable. The sen
sational turn of the evening wan
stowed coylv away a.f the conclu-
sion of the programme, when The
Flying Cadonas went through a
hair-raising collection of trapeze,
swing, and somersault work right
in in the do me of the great tent.
Their marvellous work, so accu-
rately gauged, so daringly attempt-
ed, and so neatly accomplished,
moved the entire gathering of
spectators to admiration. Swing-
ing from a frail trapeze many feet
above the ground, the four mem
berg at various periods release their
hold, fly through spare and grasp
a second traneze in mid-air. A
second's miscalculation wofild spoil
the feat, and place the lives of the
performers in danger despite the
net stretched below. Alfredo put
the final touches on a, grand per
formance by turning a double
somersault in mid-air whilst blind
folded a,nd with a, bag over his bead
Thus handicapped, he left his own
trapeze 50 feet above the ground,
•somersaulted, and was caught
by Ilia partner. His own trapeze
was again caught, and he landed
back on the platform. The first
attempt failed but he f p H out ot
the net uninjured. There were many
other turns, too numerous to men-
tion in detail. Several clever feats
of horsemanship were revealed by
Alex. Christie, Les (two) Gennetts,
Edith Welby, Cooke. George
Christie and the Howlands’ Family
Society Circus. Earl Ludley, the
only riding pony in the world, and
trained by Mr. P. Wirth, was given
a large share of applause. Taken
altogether, it was a unique show,
something unusual to Kalgoorlie,
and last night’s audience was more
than satisfied. No circus would, of
course be complete without clowns,
and “Joey” and Georgy,” whose
frequent appearances were ever
welcome, provided all that was
necessary on the .humorous side.
To-night the performance will b*i
repeated.
“FID.”
Wirth’s Famous -Clown.
The fnost happy-go-lucky chap around
the Wirth Bros.’ Circus is “Fid,” the
Charlie Chaplin comedian. Always jolly,
and full of fun.
He is an Australian by birth, but h'a<
spent most of his life in U.S7A., and',
proud to say. he has not caught the nasal
speech. “Fid” has returned to his
native country just to see how they have
been getting along without him. He is
the principal comedian of the New York
Hippodrome, and can only stay in Austra-
lia for a short season, as he must return
to New York for the 1917 production. In
an interview with this comedian I asked,
“What made you go in for impersonations
of Charlie Chaplin?” The answer was
very short, ‘'They wanted it, and they
got it.” On being asked his experiences
while in U.S.A. “Fid!” smiled and said he
never had any. They were all events.
His principal comedy number was with
a kangaroo which had escaped from the
circus while in Madison Square. The
kangaroo had cleared and 1 scared all
Broadway until “Fid’” made his appear-
ance and caught the tail of Australia’s
emblem and safely lodged it back in its
cage. “A policeman then made his ap-
pearance and wanted to arrest me for dis-
turbing the peace.
“Where do we get our comedy from?
Well, it just seems to be hanging around,
Most of _ ifc is taken from life. Simply a
burlesque on nonsense.
“Why do clowns always appear during
the riding acts? That is to give the horses
a rest; also to give him bis bearings.
Horses can only go so many times round
a ring before begin to get giddy,
which is only natural when one comes to
think of the size of the regulation cir-
cus ring. Oh, yes. the circus rings in all
parts of the world are the same size—42
ft. diameter. All comedians with the cir<
1 cus have a section of the dressing tent
to themselves, and it is called “Clown
Alley;” and the name is very sacred to
the boys of that section.”
ROBINSON TEN BIG SHOWS

dappled grey and all evenly matched. They are
sleek and impressive, and evoke many compli-
ments from bystanders in the parade. The
wagons are painted tastefully and the train is
decorated in a bright red.

WIRTH’S CIRCUS.
Wirth's Circus opens in the Domai,
this evening. The circus arrived a
Hobart last evening by special trains
from Launceston, and the services of
the elephants were requisitioned to
unload the waggons. Messrs. Mirth
Bros, have with them the pick of the
world's artists, among them Desperado,
:lig man who defies death-every night
in his thrilling" dive of 80ft. On ac-
count of the risk ho takes the insurance
companies will not insure him. La
Belle Victoria gives a performance on
the tight and slack wires, and amongst
other artists are Alfredo, described as
the Hying man. the Flying Cadonas, the
Original Nelson Family of nine mem-
bers, the crack American acrobat com-
bination, the Bastien Family, also of
nine members, a wonderful French
troupe of acrobats, the Hobson Sisters,
America’s wire-walking prodigies, the
Stair Sisters, contortionists and gym-
nasts, and Dare-Devil Desperado, and a
score of others. An incident occurred
at Launceston while Worth Bros.’ cir-
cus was unloading at the railway sta-
tion which illustrates the sagacity and
usefulness of the elephant. One of the
heaviest and biggest waggons crashed
through the platform-into such a posi-
tion that it seemed impossible to move
it under several hours. Mr. C. West,
the circus transport officer, and Captain
Burroughs, who lias charge of the ele-
phants, called in the aid of the ele-
phants, and in less than a quarter of
an hour had the waggon raised, and on
the way to the ground.
Cass Mahomet, Vera Murray and Parker
(Rojal Comedy Coy) on Sunday night were
the guests of the Musical Weatherlejs at
Fullers’ Hotel. And some host is Dad. No
dull moments pass. A very entertaining
and interesting bunch this family, and result
was a right royal time eD joyed by everybody.
TOO REALISTIC
ACTRESS’S NARROW ESCAPE
Mock tragedy very nearly became real tra-
gedy at Wirth’s Hippodrome yesterday
afternoon. Miss Connie Martyn, who plays
the part of the German spy in the drama
Kultur, was going through her performance
at the matinee, but in the sensational scene
in which she is thrown into the floodwaters
by Miss Muriel Dale as the Red Cross nurse
she was unable to rise again from the water,
as her clothes became tangled over her head
and imprisoned her arms. After the lapse
of two or three minutes the other performers
became alarmed, and one of them dived into
the tank and brought her to the surface in
an unconscious condition. Resuscitation
methods were adopted, and in about 20 min-
utes Miss Martyn recovered. She was able
to resume her performance last night.
KULTUR
HIPPODROME WAR DRAMA
The greatest praise is due to the Messrs. Wirth
Bros, for their courageous attempt to reproduce in
Sydney the magnificent spectacular shows which
have made the New York Hippodrome famous
throughout the world. The house which witnessed
Kultur, the Aqua drama, which Messrs. AVirth pro- ;
.duced for the first time at the Hippodrome last ''
evening, was not worthy of the entertainment pro-' j
vided. It is true that the production was some- !
what loosely knit, that the lines could be cut and
brisked up without any sacrifice, ( and that the
stirring climax was reached somewhat Daltingly.
But these are blemishes inseparable from the first i
production of a show which has the merit of being j
both novel and thrilling, and which should not b£. r >
missed by those who value pluck and enterprise and
who seek new sensations.
In times of peace, when thoughts find resting
place in sport and dance and song, such a produc-
tion as Kultur would receive little welcome. But
now, after the world has been shocked by the de-
tails of the invasion of Belgium and by stories of
the butchery and barbarity of the Huns, the piece
strikes a responsive chord, and it serves the same
purpose as do illustrations through an absorbing
novel.
It is probable, too, that Kultur has a recruiting
value. Indeed, it was written by Mr. Leonard P.
Durell, the producer at the Hippodrome, with the
idea of spurring- listless youths on to the realisation
of their national obligations, and if vivid represen-
tation of suffering could assist to that end, it must
have done good when it was produced in London.
The incidents of KultvJC are said to have actually
occurred on the occupation of Brussels by the Huns.
Representatives of the church are shot, women are
cruelly ill-treated, succor is refused wounded enemy
soldiers, and many more of the German methods
of warfare in relation to the civil population are
reproduced. There is a story running through it
which relieves the dire picture, and there are seve-
ral exciting situations, culminating in the opening
of the dykes and the flooding of the countryside
as a defence against the enemy.
The scene is a remarkable one, for sufficient
water is released to fill the old circus ring (now a
great tank, which can be adjusted to any depth
down to 10ft.), in which houses float, soldiers fight,
and horses dash about, making altogether an im-
mense spectacle.
The leading parts are taken by Mr. Prank Haw-
thorne and Miss Muriel Dale, who, with Mr. Mes-
senger Beilis, supply the love story. Mr. Harry
Leston (hotel proprietor), Mr. W. E. Adkin (Father
Sebastian), Mr. Donald Cornwallis (burgomaster),
Mr. C. Donald (King of the Belgians), Mr. J. Good-
all (German spy), and Mr. Benson North and Mr.
David Drayton (German officers), The Kaiser
(Mr. D. Wallis) and the Crown Prince (Mr. C.
Dayton) were also in the cast. The scenery was
charming.
The first part of the programme was supplied by
Maximo, an exceedingly clever slack wire walker;
the Proveanies, trick cyclists; and Mr. Jack Wal-
ler’s company of delightful entertainers, including
Mr. Waller (comedian), Miss Cecilia Gold (musical
comedy and burlesque artist), Mr. Gregory Ivanoff
(violinist). Mr. Frederick W. Dennett (an accom-
plished pianist), and Miss Ada Smart (balladist).
Kultur will be played nightly, and when it gets
into its stride certain defects common to first
nights will no doubt disappear. It is a long step
from elephants and lions to classical music and
drama, but Messrs. Wirth Brothers have accom-
plished the feat, and they deserve the public’s ap-
preciation.

Barmaid Barbara’s Bitter Complaint.
HUSBAND GETS HER SACKED FROM VARIOUS HOTELS.
Bench Says She Has Been Driven to Take the Wrong Turning.
Kirk Accuses Her of .Immorality—While Living in Adultery
Himself—Police Give Barbara a Good Name—Kirk
Fined and Bound Over to Keep the Peace.
Many hours were occupied at the Fblaroy >
Court on Friday in listettting to a somewhat
unusual dispute between a young married
couple. Barbara Kirk, of 87 Moor-street,
who was represented by Mr. N. L. O Con-
nor, charged her husband, Ernest Alfred
Kirk, with having used threatening words to
her on divers dates in a public place. Mis-
Kirk also sought to have her husband bound
over to keep the peace, the allegation being
that Kirk had declared that ho would Ouj
a revolver and shoot his wife. Mr. J- J*
Carroll appeared for defendant.
Mr. O’Connor told the justices (Messrs.
W. White, chairman, and J- Hardy) that
the life of a hard-working and industrious
young girl had been ruined by a husband
who had picked up with another woman, and
had had love-children to her. Kirk had
even gone so far as to threaten to
WHITE TO TRUTH ’
about certain la censed victualler? employ ng
his w' s ?e, a married woman, as barmaid,
Sri-om testimony was teddered by M:s.
Kirk, who said the: after marrying her hus-
band, a miner, at Maryborough, in HXrir.
they Lived together for 12 months. Her
husband then obtained employment at the
Korunsburra coal mines; but as he
sent her 15s. per fortnight, and she had no
clothes worth talking of, their happy home
in the country had to be sold up. Mot omy
that, but her husband was always runnim;
after all sorts of other women, and often
told witness that it way a. mistake fru a
man to ever marry. Witness, win bad been
a dressmaker, then obtained ■ situation m
Uio city as a barmaid. First she lost o'i«
situation, and then another, through her
husband t urning up at each place am cn ,u,-
ing a disturbance. In addition to that, her
husband got into the habit ot oaLmg wn-
oess names, implying that she was a pros-
t tute, as well as alleging that her mother
had a number of
ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN*.
There was not the slightest foundation lor
either of .these allegations. Now that the
hotels closed up so early, witness was never
out late at night, as she, .invariably burned
home to her lodgings. She was so afraid of
meeting her husband that at times sne had
, to get a constable to escort her home. Gn
die night of February 12 her met
her in Moor-street, threatened to disfigure
her face so that she could never work be-
hind a bar again, and wound up by dec.ar-
ing that he was going to shcot her with a
revolver. Her husband remained outside
the house for over two hours, calling witness
ill the filthy names he could lay his tongue
to. Witness thought, there was every proo-
•ibiliiy of her husband shooting or dishgur-
inc her as his threats were becoming worse
and worse. Kirk had been living with Ger-
tie Wilkinson, one of the women in court,
and he had owned up to being the lather
of one of her two children.
The Chairman: 1 f this story is true, ana
I have no reason to ; doubt it so tar, e
woman in the witness bos
SHOULD HAVE A DIVORCE*.
Witness: Even when I walk out wuh any
af my gpntjeman friends, my husband stops
ns and threatens to /rake my companion a
in s j/ ,w actio a . \
To Mr. Carroll: I have been afraid of rny
husband for “seven long years,'• but lie has
only been threatening me and following me
about for the past 12 months. Just prior
to last Christmas Day, my husband dropped
across me with a gentleman friend, accused
me of being a common street-walker, and
declared that I did not earn my money
honestly.
Mr. Carroll -. Where did yon meet that
gen. tiem an friend ?
’ Witness: Just by accident in the street.
He knew I was married, and after going
into an hotel we went to the pictures.
How many times have you been out with
that gent? —Twice or thrice.
How long have you been living at 87 Moor-
street ?—A-bout two months.
With a man? —Yes, because my husband
h-as driven me to it by preventing me from
earning an honest living.
The Chairman: The indications axe that
this young woman has been driven to it
through the actions of her husband.
Witness : When we first parted I was still
REALLY FOND OF MY HUSBAND,
but it has been a case of incompatibility of
temper with him all along. I ceased to
love my husband when he wrote from
Ruthexglen about having such a good time
with the two daughters of a rodent there.
After hearing that I gave him up alto-
| getheir.
j M r. Carroll: And changed your name as
I well. I believe?
Witness: I only did that so as to try ana
j prevent my husband from finding out where
| x wa * employed, and causing my dismissal
1 He always found out where T was, and told
mv gentleman friends that I was a pros-
fcitute. There is no hope of any sort of a
reoonci.H-a.uon, as my husband liae now a
family by another • woman.
Did your husband write to you recently
asking that you meet him a.t the corner of
Exhibitions Gardens so as to fix up matters
regardine? a divorce? —I was afraid io meet
Him in daylight, let alone in the dark.
Mr. O’Connor: Especially if the husband
A REVOLVER IN HIS POCKET.
Mr Carroll (to witness): Who is the big
bloke your husband writes to you about?
_ I don’t know, but it’s ail bluff on Kirk’s
part lolking about divorce. He has even
gone so far as to write to nearly every
registry office in Melbourne telling those
people not to give me a job.
Have you ever got a man to give your
husband a thrashing in. the Exhibition Gar-
dens ? —Not me.
Or in Snowden Gardens?—l don’t know
of any such place.
Have you been going about and living
with a man named Albert Page?—l have
not.
Would you mind letting me know under
what name you worked in the Opera House
bars ?—lt was Miss Barbara Dorrington.
Why such a name? —I took it out of a
book.
Why go down to the house where your
husband is living - if yon are so frightened
of him?—l only wont down to the corner
to give his woman some underdotbLng.
JM4S&E9& .frts given by Ba-rtok* Mafferzomi,
'p&aan-c&otliea constable, who said he had
known Kirk and his wife ever since their
childhood. Mis. Kirk had always been a
bard work pg and
LITTLE WOMAN,
while her husband was a bud mam and a
km - scoundrel, who neglected his love child-
ren. Witness knew that Kirk had done
some dirty things in addition to getting
his wife the sack from various situations.
On di’ffetjtmt dates Mrs. Kirk had turned u>p
at the polio© station ail of a tremble to com-
plain about the brutal treatment she* had
received from her husband.
Mr. Carroll: You know, don't you, from
inquiries, that my client » always at
Witness: Even so he does not- keep RL
fhddreii. 4 He has starved £U.ui hcaasaaered
he wc«n-aso he is now living with.
Are you sure?—-The woman has complain-
ed to xna about Kirk’s brutality. He has
an illegitimate youngster under the care
of the Department for Neglected Children.
Mrs. Kirk is a hardworking girl, and helps
u> support her younger sisters.
Mr. J. Hardy, J.P.: Kirk is an awfully
mean specimen of a man, who does not eup-
j port his own wife, and in every probability
I has driven her to
TAKE THE WRONG TURNING.
Kirk’s sworn testimony was. to the effect
that ho fiad never kicked or beaten hiss wife
during the' v whole of their married life. The
onF thing be ever did was to push ius wife
aside when she introduced Albert Page to
him as her brother. Witness wanted hia
wife to get a divoroe so as he would then
be in a position to marry the other wo-
man he was living with. The reason for
one of their disputes arose through witness
asking his wife for a certain photo. To
this Mrs. Kirk replied i&ai she would have
to ask her young man for it. Never at any
time had witness seen certain hotelkeepers
: with the object of getting them to sack has
wife. On one occasion his wife got the
sack because she stuck u-> for the Germans
and ran down the Britishers. He had no
’ enmity towards his wife, and no desire to
jdo her a personal injury. When he called
I at the house in Moor-etreet o-n the night of
; February 12, his wife
FLEW INTO A PASSION
because witness heard of her getting into
bed with a man named Carter.
The Chairman: You complain of your
wife, yet you are living in adultery with
another woman.
Witness : My wife has rained my life.
In what way?—She asked me to marry
her so as to get away from her mother.
Why sion vour wife in the street or fol-
j low her about?—-I had not spoke.i to her for
sis. years, and just dropped aerpss heir ac-
| cidentallv in the street.
> Mrt O’Connor: Do you mean to say that
yon. want ’-aur wife back once more?
! Wi inoss Not after the way she has treat-
’ ed roc.
You know that your wife was sacked from
Lib? T-Watre Royal Bet!. r . ..gi^ybufg-No-
! tieng of the kmd happened through me.
D>d you not threaten Mrs. Coates, the
licensee, that you would write to ‘Truth”
SHOWING HER UP
j for employing married ladies as barmaids?
—-Nothing of the sort.
.- - - J • --.f* • 1
But you ’phoned to Mrs. Coates, telling.l
her what you intended doing in “Truth”? —j
Perhaps I did. ;
Wag your wife sacked from the Apollo 1
Hotel, Russell-sireet, and the Telegraph
Hotel, Little Bourke-street, through you?,—
I only ’phoned up the licensees to ask them *
if they knew my wife was a married woman j
How about the registry offices?—l only \
wrote to two of them years ago.
Why?—Because I wanted to get the wife j
back again with me.
The Chairman : How long have you been I
living with the other woman?—About four
years; but we have
ONLY GOT ONE CHILD.
Mr. O’Connor : Will you deny going down I
to the Ballarat Star, when your wife was i
employed there, and causing a scene?—That !
never happened.
And took Gertie Wilkinson down with you
as well? —But that was some time after the
wife had left the Rallarat Star.
In answer to the Bench, Kirk said ho
would eive an undertaking not to interfere
with his wife or her employment in the
•j future. He could promts® them that he
would never recognis' h's w'fe again.
For using threatening words, Kirk was
.fined 2<X; in default, seven days’ imprson-
ment. Costs, 265., were allowed. Kirk was
also, directed to find two sureties of £lO, as
well as a personal one for £lO, to keep the
. peace towards his wife for 12 months.
Mr. O’Connor announced that the sure-
j t : es would not be enforced as long as Kirk
j did not interfere with his wife.
Elephants to the Rescue.
During shunting operations at Gatton
on Thursday night a sleeper coach, form-
ing part of Wirtb’s circus special train,
became derailed at the points. Consider-
ably difficulty was experienced in replac-
ing the coach on the metals, and eventu-
ally the elephants connected with the
circus were requisitioned. By. pushing
or lifting at both ends and the side. of the
car the elephants gave valuable assistance
in putting the derailed coach back on the
line. It is stated that a bogie of the
coach was damaged, and the coach had to
be taken off the train, another carnage
being substituted. At least one tram was
delayed by the mishap, and the circus
special arrived at Toowoomba some hours
late.
J. Rougal, tiger wntifig from
Fort de Rock, Sumatra, 6/T>/19, says:—
“Dear ‘Hawklet,’ —Just a few lines to
let you know that 1 am still in the land
of the living. No doubt you have heard
of the escape I had with one of the
tigers, one which was caught in Malacca,
and which had been a voracious man-
eater prior to my purchase of it. This
incident occurred on the second time I
entered the arena with it, and I cam
assure you that if any of the eight
others had attacked me at the time it
had its claws on my body, I would have
been a ‘goner.’ My costume was torn
to ribbons, and the audience kept the
pieces which fell from my coat. So
severe was its attack on me that my
medals on my breast were scattered
all over the ring. The Australian pub-
lic would remember me being with
Wirth Bros.’ Circus, as an animal
trainer, for 12 years, after which I
joined Harmston’s Circus, and I have
been now with Fillis for the past four
years. We are at present touring
Sumatra, and shortlv return to India.
Best regards to all old friends. We may
visit Australia at any time.”
Mr. and Mrs. George Wirth, of “Rill-
worth,” Beach-road, Darling Point,
celebrate their silver wedding to-day.
They were married in Uitenhage, Cape
Colony, South Africa, June, 29, 1894.
Their friends and relations here in
Australia, as well as In England,
Africa. Cuba, and New Zealand, have
not forgotten the occasion, as every
mail lately has brought them some
pretty or valuable memento.

22nd BATTALION'S WAR RECORD.
Now that peace draws near, the bat-
talions of the A.I.F. are beginning to take
count of the their numbers, honors and
casualties. The 22nd Battalion A.I.F. has
just issued a circular memorandum which
shows that it had a total of f«406 casual-
ties, of whom 00 were killed in Gallipoli,
and 784 in France, making a total for this
unit only of 844 deaths. There were 2173
wounded, 285 gassed, 44 prisoners of war,
and 2C57 invalided. The battalion won
honors totalliing 289 for all ranks, and had
the, honor of being the last battalion to be
withdrawn from the firing line after the
armistice.
Wirths’ Great Circus.
The magnificent circus and
menagerie of Messrs Wirth
Brothers Limited, which will
visit Pittsworth on Monday Ist
September, for one niizht only,
took forty years to organise and
bring to its present position of
Australia’s foremost entertain-
ment institution. It has travel-
led twice around the globe, and
its proprietors have each circled
the earth six times in search of
novelty performers and strange
wild animals to bring back to
their native country for the bene-
fit of their brother Australians.
And with a whole lifetime be-
hind th-m of success added to
success, the Wirth Brothers claim
this year to have got together a
show that has never bee equalled
in Australia or out of it. Among
the novelties never before seen in
Australia, Wirths now present
I the Cevine Troupe, four ladies
nd two gentlemen, in an act
ntitled, “The Maniacs of the
V r ire,’’ running, dancing, leap-
rogging, and somersaulting on
ight-wires with as much appar-
nt ease as if they were on the
[round ; the Three Garcias.

ed lady gymnast on the high tra-

around in his trapeze Loop of
Death like a stone in a sling ; and
Silly Danny, the clown with his
flock of performing geese, the
only act of the kind in the world.
A welcome reappearance is Mr
Tex Bailey and his trained horses
dogs and sheep, in living statu-
ary poses, faithfully reproducing
the fascinating alabaster statues
of the world’s art galleries; the
marvellous Howards, thought,

man in the world. Accompany-
ing the circus is the finest trav-
elling menagerie of wild animals
south of the line, which will be
open to the public at 'a small
jharge from 4 to 5 p.m., when
he lions, tigers, jaguars, seals,
dephants, monkeys, bears and
lyenas will be fed.
A GBEAT ACHIEVEMENT.
The stinking fish “patriots” who are con-
| tin u ally decrying Australia’s achievements
j m the war should study the figures quoted
; bv the Minister for Defence last week
1 Senator Pearce stated that 366.523 men had
passed into the ranks, and of these 302,570
had been sent overseas. He added that
there were probably another 100,000 who had
volunteered, but had been rejected for medi-
cal reasons. This is a very low estimate,
as anyone who keeps tab on the recruiting
figures will admit. The rejections usually
pan out about 50 per cent, of the volunteers,
and often range much higher. Taking the
Defence Department’s estimate of 40 per-
cent. rejections as a guide, it would be safe
to say that fully 140,000 volunteers have
been,._rejeeted. This would bring the total
number of volunteers to over half a million,
cr more than 10 per.cent, of the population!
No other British Dominion car show such
a record. Conscriptionists admit that even
under compulsion a nation cannot, safely
put more than 10 per cent, of population j
into the field, yet when it is shown that 10 i
per cent, of Australia’s population has al- j
ready volunteered, and that recruits are j
still coming forward freely, their only an- j
swer is the howl, “We must have Conscrip-
tion.” What’s the use of reasoning with
such people?
AUSTRALIAN HEROES.
According to the Secretary of De-
fence (Mr. Trumble), the casualty list
for Australia from the beginning of the
war until May 21. 1917, for all ranks,
was: Dead, 24,106; wounded, 31,585;
missing, 5,102; total, 60.793. It was ex-
plained that the men listed as wounded
did not include those who had gone
hack to the trenches.
.73>sr1 By authority of the
Major-General Legge, Chief of the
General Stall', tells us (“West Austra-
lian,” November 24, 1917):
'there were abroad cn September
do last: —-At sea, 5,145; in Egypt
and Palestine, 17,73 d; in Mesopo-
tamia, 357; in France, 104,395; in
England, including hospitals, 71,- .
Su9; at sea, returning to Australia,
17,016. Those in England include
about 20,000 reported by General ,
Sir William Birdwood as fit and in I
various stages of reinforcements j
training. in Australia the number
training for service abioad on Oc-
tober 31 was 255 officers and 16,316 !
other ranks. ' ,


CYCLONIC STORM.
GREAT wind visits
straVford.
CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE RESULTS.
What is in all probability the most,
extraordinary storm effect to have, yet
been felt in'that part of the Dominion
struck Stratford at 6.15 a.m. on Tues-
day, when residents near the racecourse
and'along the line of Ariel Street, were
alarmed at a loud booming noise like
the sound of mighty rushing waters.
Those who looked out of their windows
saw a terrifying black cloud coming
from the direction of the racecourse,
and one man —the only one so far as can
be ascertained to be on the road right
in the track of the cyclone—thought
•his last moment had arrived. Hurled
from hi 3 ■well-laden cart he was unable
to see anything until the wind had
passed, and then discovered that his
frightened horse had bolted.
So far as could be seen this morn-
in" on going over the ground devastated
(says the “Stratford Post" of Tuesday)
the damage by the great wind com-
menced by the levelling of a fence on the
road near the racecourse. From thence
there is evidence of an undulating move-
ment as well as a forward rush, because
some objects in the path of the win!
have escaped untouched, while others,
apparently more firmly planted, are rent
and torn as by a giant hand. At Mr. J.
Sharroeh’s house a chimney was torn oil
and then a number of fences are cut
right through. The current appears to
have here taken temporarily a more
westerly direction and deviated to carry
away the side of the roof off Mrs.
Smith’s ftouse at the corner of Regan
and Ariel*Streets. The back portion of
the house was slightly damaged, some
of the weather hoards being torn adrift
from the framework. The current only
caught half of Mrs. Smiths house, hut
the roof of that portion was carried over
to the Recreation Ground. The tele-
phone wires in front of the house were,
broken, and a section of the roof left
suspended from the wires.
THE CROQUET CLUB SUFFERS.
The tennis anad croquet clubs pavilion,
in Victoria Park, appears to have stood
in the direct line of the cyclone, and the
building was torn off its foundations and
lifted bodily about ten feet from its
original site. In the course, of that
journey it was capsized, and it is now
resting floor uppermost. One door was
blown off and carried about a dozen
yards, while the resfi of the building has
been considerably damaged.
|| PILES HURLED FIFTY YARDS.
After passing over the croquet club’s
pavilion the cyclone appears to have
turned almost at right angles and swept
the fire brigade's competition stand clean
from the piles on which it rested. The
piles were torn out of the ground and
hurled a distance of 50 yards. The stand
and shed were absolutely demolished,
and stray timber is all that remains of
what once was the stand. A consider-
able quantity of timber from the stand
found a resting place in the lake in
Victoria Park.
DAMAGE TO THE PARK.
The Park at the corner of Cordelia
and Fenton Streets suffered consider-
ably, and about a dozen trees were
broken off near the ground. One tree
trunk, about 2ft in thickness, was cut
in two as if it had been partly cut and
then brought down in "a fall." A great
quantity of rooting iron found a resting
1 place among the trees.
PRIVATE PROPERTY DAMAGED.
Mr. Cecil Wright’s house on the
corner of Fenton and Cordelia Streets
was damaged to some extent. A num-
ber of sheets of iron were blown from
the back portion of the house and- the
skylight was torn off the roof of the
bathroom The back fences were all
Hovelled to the ground. The house next
jto Mr. Wright’s on Fenton Street also
j received the full force of the gale. The
i kitchen and scullery chimneys were
completely overthrown, and the bricks
falling on the porch at the rear of the
house did considerable damage. The
course of the cyclone altered after pass-
ing over Air. Wright’s house, a number
of trees and a house on the opposite
side of Cordelia Street being next to
feel the full force. Limbs were torn off
the trees and a number of fences re-
moved bodily.
At the corner of Cloton Road and
Cordelia Street the iron' fence on the
boundary of Newton King’s yard was
blown down, and the telephone wires
were all down. A number of the wires
were blown over on to one of Newton
King’s sheds. Much havoc and disorder
had been wrought here, and though none
of the main buildings had been over-
thrown, one small store collapsed alto-
gether. The yards were littered up
■with all sorts of debris from other
•people’s properties, while Air. Newton
King's iron from his building and plank-
ing from the walls was right across the
river. A section of tlie roofing iron of
the main building was removed, and
placed on the opposite side of the roof as
lif by magic. A portion of the iron fence,
facing Cloton Road, was carried a dis-
tance of about twenty-five yards and
trashed through the main door of the

BATTLE IN'WALKER .STREET
CIRCUS ROUSEABOUTS v. SYRIANS.
STORY UNFOLDED IN COURT.
FOUR MEN SENT TO GAOL.
So far ae the residents of Walker street
are concerned. New Year’s Eve will best be
remembered by the stirring contest or battle
which took place there about the time that
the minutes of the last day of the old yeai
were slipping past, between a gang of some
30 or 35 rouseabouts attached to Wixths
Circus and a number of the Syrian residents
in Walker street. From the story related
in the City Police Court yesterday before
Mr J. R. Bartholomew, S.M., it appears
that a number of men from the circus were
ih Walker street between 10 and 11 p.m. on
Friday, evidently intent on having a mix-up
with the Syrians, but when they beheld the
numbers of the enemy they retreated to the
circus headquarters, and having held a coun-
cil of war. an expeditionary force set out
to attack the foe. Before reaching Walker
street this time they sent out an advance
guard under the leadership of a half-caste
Maori named Dallas. True to the traditions
of the Native race, this young fellow went
straight to the point where he was to be
reinforced, and when Victor Roy Lee ar-
rived with the main body, and gave the
signal, the trouble began. One of the men
led by Dallas set the ball—or metal —roll-
ing by assaulting an aged Syrian, and this
was the sign for all hands to get busy.
Dallas wanted to be in the firing line, so
he said in court, and he selected a foeman
worthy of his steel, but to his utter amaze-
ment/ he had to face two, and rather than
take any risks he “ bolted.” A general
melee took place, during which sticks,
stones, and bricks were used. The Syrians
were damaged considerably when the in-
vaders withdrew, fearing that reinforce-
ments from the police would be coming to
the aid of the Syrians. When the police ar-
rived they gathered up an overcoat, left in
a hurry by Lee, and generally surveyed the
scene of the recent conflict, and attended to
the wounded. They were supplied with de-
tails of the struggle by the wife of one of
the victims, who did some smart detective
work and located the ringleaders of the
disturbance and accurately described them
to the police, thus enabling them to appre-
hend four members of the gang before the
circus left Dunedin. These men were
brought before the court yesterday.
William Branston was charged with using
threatening behaviour- in Walker street on
New Year’s Eve, within view of passers-by,
whereby a breach of the peace was occa-
sioned, also with assaulting John Peters,
and using obscene languege.
Dallas Gordon M‘Nicol was charged with
having, in Walker street, used obscene
language, and also with having assaulted
Antoni Josephs and John Peters.
Roy Lee _ was charged with assaulting
Antoni Callis in Walker street, so as to
cause him actual bodily harm, and also with
using obscene language.
Henry Dallas was charged with using ob-
scene language in Walker street, and with
unlawfully assaulting Antoni Josephs.
Each of the accused pleaded “ Not
guilty ” to the charges preferred against
them.
Sub-inspector Brpberg prosecuted, and all
the charges were heard together. The
charge against Lee, of causing actual bodily
harm, was reduced to one of assault.
Ruby Josephs stated that she was the
wife of Antoni Josephs. On New Year’s
Eve she, along with some other women,
was standing in front of her home in
Walker street waiting for the New Year
celebrations to begin. A big crowd came
up the street, of whom the accused was one.
Immediately they saw the women they used
the expressions complained of. They
walked up as far as Melville street, and
then came back, when the language was re-
peated. Mr Josephs remonstrated with
them for using bad language in the presence
of respectable ladies. She recognised
Dallas, Lee, and Branston as the chief
offenders in respect to the bad language.
Immediately Mr Josephs spoke to the men
forming the crowd Lee assaulted him, and
then there was a general melee. While it
was m progress Lee struck Antoni Callis
in the back of his neck with a brick and
felled him, Callis falling on his face. Lee
and Dallas punched witness’s father and her
husband, having pieces of bricks in their
hands at the time. The ringleaders of this
fracas were not in court, but she pointed
them out to the sergeant at the circus.
There was no provocation given.
In answer to Branston, witness denied
having used obscene language to him at the
corner of Walker street on Saturday morn-
ing. Notwithstanding the dark night, she
was certain that she recognised the accused
as the man who assaulted her father and
commenced the row. To Lee she denied
that the trouble was caused by some of her
people throwing stones and sticks.
Dallas asked her if she could see the
pieces of bricks in his closed hands in the
dark, ano she replied that she could.
Antoni Josephs, husband of the last wit-
ness, corroborated her evidence. He also
stated that the first man to assault him was
Dallas, and he could not see afterwards who
hit him, but there were several. It was dark,
and he could not see who they were.
John Peters, with a badly-lacerated ear
and a fairly extensive abrasion on his left
cheek bone, was the next witness, and in
reply to Sub-inspector Broberg he said that
he came out on to the street after the ro»
had been started. Branston struck him on
his ear and dazed him. He was struck
afterwards, but by whom he could not say.
To Branston, he said he recognised him
as the man who assaulted him.
John Divas gave evidence as to the open-
ing of the fight, and stated that Lee was
the leader of the circus gang. He saw Lee
strike Callis with a brick in his hand lie
also saw Dallas throw a stone, and Callis
immediately fell. He went away after see-
ing Branston assault John Peters.
Antoni Callis, one of the victims of the
affray, showing two black eyes, stated that,
between 11 o’clock and 11.15 on the night
in question, half the circus mob came up
Walker street, apparently looking for
trouble. Nothing happened, and- they went
back and got reinforcements. He heard of
trouble, and left his home to investigate.
When going down the lane leading from the
house he was struck in the back of the neck
with a rock, and he remembered no more
about the affray.
f Sergeant M’Glone and Constable Beer
gave evidence as to the arrest of the ac-
cused, the latter producing Lee’s overcoat,
in the pocket of which there was a quantity
of road metal. He also stated that he had
a revolver and some cartridges in his pos-
session when arrested.
William Richardson Branston, m ins own
defence, stated that, at the time of the dis- ,
tuhbance, he was in the reading room at I
the Masonic Dining Rooms. Some time after !
that a crowd of the circus men came in,
and were talking about the men they had
knocked out. In this way he sought to
prove an alibi.
Cross-examined by Sub-inspector Broberg,
he maintained that he was not mixed up j
in the trouble. He had never been in court
before, except as a witness.
Dallas Gordon M'Niool stated that he was
present for only about two minutes, as he
was knocked down, and when he got up
ho ran away. The only man he saw do any
striking was a man named Kelly. He went
up with the mob because they said they
were going to have a night out.
To Sub-inspector Broberg, he stated that
it was too dark to see who struck the blows, j
but he saw a man named Kelly hit at a 1
Syrian.
Lee admitted having a hand in the en-
counter, but stated that, when the Syrians
began to use sticks and stones, he, along ;
with some others, ran down into Prnces
street.
To Sub-inspector .Broberg, he admitted
having gone back to the cirous to get some
of the other men, but this was because the
(Syrians had called the cirous chaps a lot
of names, and had thrown crackers and
Chinese bombs at them. He did not have
a revolver on him during the fracas, but got
it afterwards from his boss to give to one
of the men, who owned it. He did not see
Branston there, and when he told Constable
Brer that he (Branston) was in the row he .
believed that all the cirous chaps were in j
it
Henry Dallas stated he was the first to go
into Walker street, but he did not have a
rro. He tried to get into the fray once,
but when he was up against two men he
“bolted” up the road to a lamp, and when
he turned round a brick landed at his feet.
He did not know who threw it.
The Magistrate said the charge of creating
a breach of the peace against Branston was
merged into the assault of John Peters.
1 There was one charge which had not been
proved, and this was the charge of assault
against M'Nicol, which would be dismissed.
He said that this was a blackguardly, at.taok
unon a peaceful body of citizens. This sort
of conduct could not be tolerated, and un-
desirables of this class, when they came be-
fore the court, must be shown that this kind
of an offence would be dealt with severely.
Emh of the accused would be convicted
and sentenced to two months’ imprisonment.
On the charge of using obscene language
th °v won l '! each be sentenced to three months
with hard labour, the sentences to be con-
current.
FINISH
Of the Bud Atkinson Shows.
Melbourne. Australia, April 4 (Special cable
to The Billboard).—The badly crippled Bud At-
kinson Shows was today purchast outright and
entire toy Messrs. Wirth Brothers, who closed
it.
The above cable puts a period to the story of
the Bud Atkinson Shows. The orgamzation was
nnt together in this country last fall and starred
for Australia with seemingly bright prospects
and everything promising. ' T ,
Its career was brief and full of trouble. s
end is final and complete. * ,
Messrs. Wirth Brothers mentioned in the
cable as the purchasers, are the circus magnates
of the island continent. They are very strongly
intrencht politically and in popular favoi.
Their supremacy has never been menaced or
even seriously disputed heretofore 1 r
chase and dismantling of the Atkinson outht
effectually prevents any attempt to galvan
it into life with new capital and ownership
The disastrous experience of Mr. Atkinson
will probably insure Messrs. Wirth Brothers
against opposition for many years to come.
They are fine fellows and receiving congratu-
lations from all over the world.

LjM DEVOUR A TRAINER.
A man named Dietrich was tom to j
piece? by liens in Onicago and partly de-
voured. Dietiieh was the assistant of
Senorita Castillo, a lion tamer and per*
former, attached to a circus. The
show had just arrived at Dearborn station,
and while Dietrich was helping to detrain
the lions he found it necessary to enter a
cage containing six of tine animals. It was
dark in the railway yard, and some of the
lions were asleep, but the presence of the
man in their cage aroused them, and as
they were not used to him they evidently
resented his entrance. One ol' them sprang j
at Dietrich and tore nis shoulder.
At once the other lions sprang on the
man, who was felled to the cage and killed.
! Excited by the smell of blood, the lions
began to devour the body, and it was neceir
sary to prod. tSieixi off with sliaxp irons and \
use a strong disinfectant to neep them
away while the body was withdrawn trom
the cage. , . , ,
While Dietrich s corpse was being ta: cn
out one of the lions escaped, and made
his way into the streets from the station
yard. He terrorised the neighborhood ior
a time, though he did no actual damage,
and after a while was captured and taken
back to his cage.


CIRCUS COLLAPSE."
COMPLETE AND DISMAL SMASH.
BUD ATKINSON’S PEOPLE STRANDED.
WHAT HAPPENED IN MELBOURNE.
Four weeks of uninterrupted bad weatheT
in Melbourne washed the Atkinson Circus
and Wild West Show off the map of Aus-
tralia. Many of the members of the big
company are stranded. Some are in actual
Ivant. And all of them are far from home,
md doubtful of their chances of getting
aaclc. .
Very dismal indeed are the stories of uhQ
trouble variously told by the luckless per-
formers. Very pathetic—for the element of
quiet self-sacrifice that tinged it all through
—was the account of the disastrous concent
that was given to-day by Miss Betty Parker*
one* of the lady riders with the show.
Miss Parker is a winsome young ladyj
whose big blue eyes spoke the sorrow that
her lips • would have concealed. A pretty
blonde, of graceful presence, she was a
figure to excite the warmest compassion as
she told her tale of desolation, in soft,
quaintly-moderated tones, just pleasant y
touched with the native Americanese. bne
has been hurt more than some of the others,
because she had further to fall. Though
a stranger in the Commonwealth, she is a
lady of much renown in the world of mm
drama. A superb horsewoman, possessed or
much natural grace, conspicuous courage,
and a ready versatility, her face is we
known wherever the better class of film pic-
tures are showm throughout the world. Ana
her dainty walking costume of tailored navy
serge sits her slender figure with nil the
grace of the more picturesque riding costume
° f “lt e is Pl such a pity,” she says, ‘There was
so much bad luck, because so many ot ua
wished to stay quite a long tune heres i
Australia. We all like the country, borne

made it all the harder for the rest. But we

“It was fierce times, certainly. I am so

We went on for five weeks, doing our best,
hoping for the best. But then the end

in the big blue eyes—“now we are here. Ana
our homes are such a long way away.
“It cannot be helped, but, oh, it is such &

52 weeks, and we all wanted to be—wanted
to see this wonderful new country that w r e
knew 7 so little about. ,
“No! I won’t go back yet if I can help it.
■ I hope something will turn up. There is to
be a film-producing stock company formed
here, I believe. I hope so, because that is
where I am right at home. I have played
with the principal Western companies the
Nestor Motion Picture Co. and Pathe
Freres, &c. Also I have had lead in musical
comedies— Charley White’s ‘Babes in Toy-
land,’ for instance. Besides that, with the
Rochester Musical Comedy Company ana
the Jessie Bonstella Company. I was play-
ing lead with the Nestor Company for nine
months, and the company ‘featured all the

ROUGH-RIDING SCHOOL.
“I began life in New York State. I got in

California to learn riding—not the flat riding,
but the mountain work. The San Verdino

with the pi ct ure s—We stern pictures. Those
are the ones I like—l’m at home m them.

“We came up from Melbourne this morn-

love and cameraderie was exchanged be-
tween the two young people, “we’ve got each

there was a power of courage and deter-
mination in her voice.
There are eight of the Wild Westerners
stranded in Sydney at present. They have
had little or no money paid them for a long
while, and most are “on the rocks.” Steps
are being taken to arrange a benefit per-
formance for the relief of their more pressing
| necessities.
It was by the Ventura that the luckless
Wild Westerners came to Australia. The
Ventura leaves for the States on Saturday.

people went down to see the mailboat —to

beheld her, probably.

THEATRICAL TRAGEDY.
DEATH OF WELL-KNOWN
RUSSIAN DANCER.
A tragedy, resulting in the death of Alex-
ander Yakavoleff, well known as a Russian
dancer in Sydney, and his wife, occurred at
a residential establishment in Margaret-street
last night. Yakavoleff, according to the
story told by the eight-year-old boy of the
deceased woman, fired at his wife, and then
killed himself.
Madame Yakavoleff had been living in a
residential fiat at 42 Margaret-street. She
and another tenant occupied the fiat with
tioris, the deceased woman s child, as Mon-
sieur and Madame Beaudowin. Yesterday
evening, at about 6.30, Yikavoieff called at
the flat and asked for his wife, who, at the
time, was in the basement talking to a
friend. She came upstairs and joined her
husband, who was in the bedroom of the
fiat. He pleaded with ter to return to him,
whereupon she began to cry but refused.
Boris, trie boy, states that Yakavoleff then
went into the adjoining dining-room, loaded
a five-chambered revolver, and turned to the
bedroom, as he did so firing at his wife; and
then turned the revolver on himself. The
boy rushed to the elevator, and came down
to tell a friend of his mother’s, whom he
knew as “Auntie.” This lady, in company
with another tenant, went upstairs. Madame
Yakavoleff ' was lying flat on the floor in a
pool of blood, whilst Yakavoleff was in a
sitting posture beside the bed. The latter
had a bullet-wound in his temple, and the
revolver was lying between the two of them;
whilst his wife had been shot behind the
right ear. The police .vere immediately in-
formed. and Sergeant Batson, of the George-
ptreet North Police Station, went to inves-
tigate the matter. The bodies were removed
to° the City Morgue.
Yakavoleff was well known here as a Rus-
sian dancer, a.nd liad appeared at the Tivoli
Theatre and elsewhere. Madame Yakavoleff
was a singer, but had not appeared recently.
During the evening Monsieur Beaudowm
rang up from an hotel to inquire after his
wife. He was informed by Sergeant Batson
that his wife was dead, and that he wanted
to see him at No. 4 Police Station, George-
street North. Beaudowin promised to do
this; but instead returned to Margaret-street
in a demented state shortly after If o'clock,
he was taken to George-street North Police
Station. Here he was charged with being

LORETTA TWINS TO RETURN
The Loretta Twins, who are with Wirtl
Bros ’ Circus in Sydney, Australia, expect t
return to the States about 2o on th.
Sonoma. They report that the Wirth Bros
Hippodrome at Sydney, is a thing of beautj
and that business is fine.
STRANGE FAMILY GATHERING
New York, May 12.—0 f all the strange
“mothering” there never has been one to equal
the strange case occurring at Wm, Bartels’ Com-
pany, 44 Cortland street, this city. Four lion
cubs were born to Spitfire, the lioness, which
formerly occupied an important place with Bar-
num & Bailey’s Circus, and Nero, the big African
lion in the Central Park Zoo. Spitfire refused to
have anything to do with the cubs, so the re-
sponsibility fell upon tlie Bartels Company to
discover some way to feed the little lions. They
brought the four from the farm in Jersey City
to New York. Tw t o were given to a hound dog
and the other two were given to Nell, a small
fox terrier. The hound dog cared not for the
new charges and during the night killed them
both: but Nell, she is the heroine of the hour.
She took to the cubs immediately, and at the
time of going to press both "mother” and
children are doing nicely.
Mr. Tony Transfield to Miss Nellie Rowland.
A wedding of interest to the circus, world
was celebrated at the Sacred Heart Church,
St. Kilda, on Saturday, November 24, when the
parties were Miss Nellie Rowland, daughter
of Mrs. Amy Rowland and the late Mr. George
A. Rowland, England, and granddaughter of
Mr. William Ginnett, and Mr. Tony Transfield,
son of the late Mr. Thomas Transfield, Eng-
land. The bride and bridegroom are both
popular artists with Wirths’ Circus, and come
from circus families famous for many years
past. The ceremony was performed by the
Rev. Father Byrne.
The bride, who was given away by her
mother, wore a smart jumper frock of white
crepe de chine, and a white hat, and she car-
ried a bouquet of lilies of the valley. Miss
Tina Rowland was bridesmaid, in a dainty
frock of pale pink ninon, with hat en suite;
she carried a bouquet to match. Mr. George
Christie was best man. Mrs. Rowland wore
an elegant coat and skirt of navy silk gabar-
dine, relieved with putty color; navy blue hat,
and carried a pale pink bouquet.
Wedding breakfast was served at the Cafe
Francais, after which Mr. and Mrs. Transfield
left by motor for their honeymoon tour.
FEATS OF STRENGTH.
“Apollon” writes: —On reading Billy
Williams’ interesting article on strong
men and tlieir feats, I was struck by
the fact that he omitted to mention
among those who have visited this
country, Emile and Otto Crotton, re-
cognised champions at their weights.
Emile, I think, while in Australia,
made a record of 300 lbs., two hands
Continental jerk, at 11 stone, which
beats Weber’s record at 14 stone,
which, I understand, stands at 275 lbs.
Otto, at the same time, established
a record at 10 stone.
Speaking of general strength feats,
I may mention that the recognised
standard of strength of the Continent
is a two-handed life of double the
lifter’s body weight. This" has been
performed by about eight men, in-
cluding Maxick, Kliment, Crotton,
Pullum and myself, but, I understand,
it has never been done in Australia.
The recognised strongest man in
the world at the present time (if be
is still alive) is Arthur Saxon, who
holds most of the heavyweight re-
cords.
I am prepared to' meet any man in
Australia for the lightweight lifting
championship at the recognised lifts
at 10 stone or at 9 stone 7 lbs., 11}
suitable arrangements can be made.
Sixty-two Children.
The Ladies’ Home Journal provides
this iri^brmation: —
“Two women, curiously enough, seem
to have the record for the largest families
that are known. And both lived across
the ocean. They each had exactly the
same number of children —sixty-two!
“One was the wife of a poor weaver
in Scotland, who bore her husband forty-
six boys and four girls, who grew to
manhood and womanhood, and twelve
others who died ere reaching their
prime.
“An English baronet adopted ten ol
the sons —rather a large order; three
other landed gentry took ten each, and
the remainder were brought up by their
parents. .
“The other woman was a peasant girl
of Tuscany, Gravata by name. She set
the seal on the family reputation and
assured herself of endless fame, although
she led off unostentatiously enough with
a baby girl, by presenting her husband
with six little boys, and followed that
the next year with five more!
“Then came triplets twice, which were
followed by a quartet. Then ensued a
long procession of ones and twos and,
as a wind-up, lest her reputation
should suffer eclipse, came four
more boys—all at once, bringing the
grand total of her living children to
sixty-two. Thus two women gave birth
to 124 children —a small village.”
WIRTH NEW HIPPODROME OPENS
Fidem Wirth sends The Billboard a letter _from
Sydney Australia, under date of April 5, in
which he says that the Wirth New Hippodrome,
situated in the heart of Sydney, opened on
April 2, and has proved a huge success. “The
building,” adds Mr. Wirth. “is considered one
of the finest in the world, including the sinking
ring for pantomimes and water spectacles. The
theater holds 3.000, and there is not a post in
the huge building. The stage is 90x60, room
enough to put on the largest of shows. Since
opening the house has been filled every night,
with booking far ahead.
“The real star attraction after her tour of
the world is Miss May Wirth. Her act is a
thriller and the most spoken of act in Sydney.
Miss May has just accomplished a lot of new
tricks that have set Sydney wild, including the
wonderful somersault from one horse to another.
The Wirth Family are also a big draw with their
seven-people comedy act. Captain Frank Huling s
Seals are making a big hit.
“The circus will play a ten weeks’ season in
Sydney, and then go on tour. The following at-
traction will be Kultur, with the huge lake show.
“The big American picture. The Birth of a
Nation, opens next Saturday at the Theater
Royal. It is well advertised and will sure draw
big.
“On Trial and Peg o’ the Ring both made their
first successful opening in Australia last night,
and can lay claim to be a big success.”
Captain Hilling's Seals.
THEIE ORIGIN AND TRAINING.
A “Manawatu Times” reporter
bad the opportunity of witnessing th.fr
marvellous performance of Captain
Hilling’s troupe of balancing seals at.
Wirth’s Circus during its Palmerston
North season, and he became rather
curious to know how the captain hud
brought them to the point of perfec-
tion.
While the seals were feeding on
their afternoon allowance of thirty
pounds of fish their master gave a
little of their history. “These chaps
came from the Santa Barbara Islands
off Los Angeles” the captain said.
“For over thirty years it has been
known that seals can be trained to
balance, and they have been experi-
mented with in America at different
times. They are protected by the>
United States Government and a spe-
cial permit has to be obtained to
catch them. The work of capturing
them is undertaken with nets by Jap-
anese fishermen of whom there nre
hundreds in these "waters. There is &
demand for them for zoos and parks,
and the Japs make a profitable busi-
ness at one hundred dollars each.”
“But how did you become inter-
; ested in them!” the reporter asked.
I“I was raised on a farm in Califor-
j uia” the captain said. “When I
grew up I became kind of uneasy,
t’.nd tried several things in the city,
but did not make much money at any
of them. I got an introduction
through a friend to a man in this
business and I have been at it ever
since.” ,
‘ ‘ Are they savage when they are
first caught,” the reporter queried.
“Yes they are fierce,” was the reply,
“and the fiercer they are the better
they turn out in the end. I have a
building with a full outfit of tanks at
a little town called Kingston out of
New York. The seals are from sev-
teen to nineteen months old when the
training starts, and it takes two years
to complete their education; one year
private tuition and another year in.
public before they can be relied upon.
We "wear leather leggiifs to the hips in
the first stages, to escape bites. The
process at first in taming as with all
wild animals is partial starvation,
then kindness and feeding. We’ve
tried the other way, but it doesn’t
act. If you get them sore of you
they won’t limber up properly again
for perhaps a fortnight. They know
when you are displeased without yon
acting it, and you must show your; .rjP-
preciation and give them encourage-
ment at first if they do a trick half
right. Next time they will try hard-
er. They are friendly when they
have succeeded in a trick they lose
them fed to make them keep going.
If you don’t feed them after they
have succeeded in a ti'icyq they lose
interest. Get it out of your head,
that balancing is natural to them. 1%
only comes with patience and train-
ing; only twnety minutes twice a day
because they won’t keep interested
any longer. You noticed those chaps
clapping with their flappers after a
trick. They started it one day and I
noticed it took with the audience so
I gave them encouragement. Now
they will always do it. That chap
playing that tune on the- bells was
fooling when I rapped him on the
flapper to warm him up. The riding
turn was most difficult to get. I had.
great trouble in getting a pony to let
a seal on its back. There are degrees
of intelligence with them as with hu-
man. beings. That chap you see ly-
ing down on his back does that intric-
ate ladder climb with tnree balls bal-
anced in this cups on the end of his
nose, and he hasn’t reached his limit
yet. It is only a question of invent-
ing something new. I was offered
three thousand dollars for him. That
fellow over there has reached his
climax and "won’t learn- any more.
They all answer to their names and
have very acute hearing.
“Well I must go and see to their
feed” the captain said, “but you
wanted to know how they fared in be-
ing carried about from place €o place.
Not so well as at home where they
get the same grade of fish all the time
but they keep very fit all the same.
They don’t grow in captivity. In
wild state they live from fffty to sev-
enty vears and some grow to weigh
a ton.”
VALUABLE CIRCUS ELEPHANT’S
DEATH.
Messrs. Wirth Brothers, Limited, sustained a
big loss early this morning by the death of
one of their elephants, Toby, which occurred at
the circus in Prince Alfred Park. Toby has
been a familiar figure in the ring for many
years, and in addition to the amount of work
she used to do, she was the best performing
elephant of the herd. It would be difficult to
estimate her age, but she must be eighty years
at least, while one statement makes her I.sft.
This morning she was placed on a lorry by
three of the other elephants, and taken away
to be disposed of. The carcase weighed over
two tons. She was worth nearly £2OOO. i

George Wirth from London, July
31 : —•
I have been pretty nearly all over
England, and have seen every theatre of
note; and 1 think I haA r e got some eve-
openers for Australia this time.
I won't tell you just yet Avhat they are,
for business reasons ; but I can promise
you this—that the acts I have engaged
have never been seen in Australia be-
fore. They ask big salaries; but we
must have something big for our Hippo-
drome opening, next March.
I am glad 1 got the talent together J
have for next year, as it is now more
difficult to get acts on account of the
Avar scare. It is nothing but war ail
over England ; and it is hard to get
artists to talk shop at all.
I go from here to America to get fur-

FRANK A. ROBBINS’ SHOW
By JAY KAY
The Frank A. Robbins Show, now on its
thirty-fifth annual tour, considering the un-
settled conditions throughout the country, is
reaping a harvest in being fortunate enough to
have booked substantial territory. With the
exception of a few stands in Connecticut busi-
ness has been up to the standard. Dismal
weather prevailed for a short period while the
show was in Connecticut, and, as a consequence,
the attendance was not as good as elsewhere.
Among the notable features added to the big
show is one Hillary Long, Avho seems to hold
the audience awe-stricken by his remarkable
exhibition of nerve and daring. After various
minor exhibitions he finishes with a slide on
his head from a highly elevated platform, leap-
ing a gap and landing on his head, a distance
of about three feet, and thence to the ground
on his feet. I dare say it is the only act of its
kind in America.
Herr Thompson and his elephants perform
Some very difficult and amusing feats to the
delight of the youngsters and grown-ups.
Dare Devil Price, in the cloud swing, Is
another nerveracking exhibition that receives
its share of applause.
The Mitchells, in a comic rube and ladder
act, are both clever performers and hard work-
ers.
The Lairds, aerial artists, are a clever team
well mated. Miss Winona Robbins, in the high
school numbers, could be justly termed the
Act Beautiful. This little lady from the
i noment she enters the ring is the cynosure of
ill eyes She seems to captivate the audience
instantaneously by her graceful masterness in
handling the equine. Will say more about the
show later.

GIRL’S RECORD RIDE.
APRIL 3, I£f*.
MELBOURNE TO SYDNEY.
MISS GRACE WAUGH ARRIVES.
A little girl in khaki, wearing a boy’s felt
bat, and riding astride a 14 hands grey pony,
was cheered all the way along George-street
to the post office this morning. It was an
unusual demonstration, but even if the pub-
lic did not know that it was Grace Waugh,
who had ridden all the way from Mel-
bourne, they would have judged from her
clothes and the pony’s sweat-covered coat
that she was concluding a long journey, and
would still have been interested in her.
The intrepid little girl went to the Post-
office because it was the concluding point of
the long ride she had undertaken. When the
journey ended, and with the knowledge that
she had arrived well within schedule time,
Miss Waugh rode to Wirth’s Circus,at Prince
Alfred Park, where she will join the com-
pany and give riding exhibitions.
The long ride was undertaken, she explain-
ed, because, firstly, she wanted to do some-
thing unusual; and secondly, she wanted to
eclipse the record of an American girl who
two years ago, crossed 500 miles of prairie in
12 days. She occupied exactly 11 days on her
long canter, and she is pardonably proud of
her achievement.
Though Miss Waugh had thought a long
time of the journey, it was hurriedly ar-
ranged at last—practically in a day. She
had not studied any maps. She had no know-
ledge of the road, because she had never been
out of Melbourne before. But despite that
fact, she cantered away from the Melbourne
Post-office last Monday week with just
enough money to Rive her hotel accommoda-
tion on the way, and no more luggage than
a road book and a few pieces of clothing.
The road book was her best friend, and if she
had had to travel ano|her 500 miles it would
have been worn out.
Miss Waugh calculated the distance nicely.
She reckoned upon an average of between 49
and 52 miles, and she kept close to those
figures, although between Goulburn and Mit-
tagong she covered 54 miles in one day.
The journey was not free from incident, al-
though it was not marred by accident. Be-
tween Billabong and Mundarlo, for instance,
the little horsewoman was told that a bridge
had been washed away from a creek, and the
thought of it affected her so much that when
she started to climb the several miles of Tar-
cutta hill she felt very lonely, very dejected,
and very homesick, and she cried. Half-way
up the hill she met a man, who tried to cheer
her up. But that made her feel that she
wanted to be home even more, and she cried
on. until she reached the top of the hill. The
creek was a little further on, and when she
drew up to it she was in that frame of mind
whieh would have stopped at nothing. She
therefore put her pony at it, and he swam
through it splendidly, while she tucked her
knees up on to the saddle, keeping clear of
the water. The incident did Miss Waugh the
world of good, and she was not “blue” after-
wards.


The R. U. New Zealanders
Clean, Breezy Combination: Home
Forwards Good : Backs Creak
in Defence
(By THE CYNIC)
The New Zealanders of the Rugby Union are always spectacular footballers,
Always an accomplished team in action. This they were in their first match of
1920 against New South Wales at the Sydney Sports Ground on Saturday. It was
a fine day for Rugby Union enthusiasts. They lined up in goodly array, old players
who have finade names in Rugger on both sides, older ones whose names are almost
a myth now, and the youngsters wearing the college badges on their hats. There
was nothing wanting in enthusiasm.
But the big public which came forth in its thousands in bygone days was not
there. The 48,000 or 52,000 of other times has diminished to 9500. Crowds were
over at the other two big grounds watching the Rugby League clubs fighting for
the Premiership. They tell you candidly they admire the New Zealanders, and
that they have no doubt the Blues led by W. T. Watson are excellent footballers,
too. But they just as candidly tell you they cannot stand the old game of Rugger
after getting used to the new brand. And I for one do not blame them, for the
old game possesses too many crudities, too many kinks that ought to be smoothed
Or polished out of existence.
The first half of the game was very interesting, changeful, breezy football,
nevertheless, with the New Zealand forwards playing on to the ball, and ever on
it, worrying it towards the goal line with characteristic New Zealand vigor, dash,
and persistency, and the home forwards getting into them and putting them hard
upon their broad backs and making a better showing than Blue forwards generally
do against the Blacks in the first match. Here and there, too, the home backs did
things that disclosed plenty of excellent talent and speed for attack, but they were,
alas, more than a trifle w’eak in defence behind the pack when the ball was on the
ground and the Blacks were using their feet. Here solidity, accuracy, and grit
were needed.
New Zealand scored four tries and two goals and the home team two tries and
two goals up to the interval. Each side showed splendid football now and then,
with tlje New Zealand forwards taking and giving passes with very fine speed and
accuracy, considering the great height of some and the great girth of others.
The home backs here and there got in some slippery attack, and if their defence
had been of the same quality New Zealand would not have had a first-half lead, for
the Blue forwards were tip-top individually, and a pretty slick machine. The
referee, Mr. Bosward, was too lenient in viewing off-side, and it jarred one accus-
tomed to the strictness in this respect of Mr. McMahon, of the Rugby League. At
first he was precise and excellent in detecting the knock-on, but later, when the
game got into its swing, he let it go too much. Each side was lucky in having
breaches leading to a try unspotted. The first home try was preceded by a big |
knock-on, a deliberate one, for it was low, and the ball was forcefully propelled j
some yards. And at least one o£ the New Zealand tries was preceded by a pass
forward.
However, the football was good, that of the home team astonishingly good,
and, in some directions, not inferior to the Blacks’. The New Zealand backs were
very nippy and clever in their combination, yet in that first half they were scarcely
superior in this respect to their opponents. They were better in defence against
the dribbling movements, and much superior in'team defence, the men getting in
and assisting one another, or backing up a defensive movement with greater speed
and consistency than the home backs. This is a matter of team work and tactics.
The Rugby Union is to be congratu-
lated on having got together such a cap-
able fifteen after the moderate form of
last season. That these All-Blacks are
equal to the champion combination of
pre-war times I do not for a moment
think. But they are quite superior to the
team which played in Sydney in 1914, the
forwards being faster and possessing
greater devil, with the backs more slip-
pery and machine-like in attack. The
great pity is that these teams are playing
a typ« of game for which the big public
will not stand, no matter how ably they
might play it. When the home backs’
defence, and especially behind the scrum-
mage, is tightened up (Dr. Beith as full-
back was a keen, sound defender), the
teams should give a very breezy exhibi-
tion in the next match.
I THE MEN OF OTHER DAYS.
Many masters of Rugger in other days,
Smiling in the sunshine, beamed when the
home team put on those first-half tries.
'‘Why," said one, “we never scored a try
ftt all against Jimmy Duncan’s team in
1903.” But what a team to quote! Has
{he wlole history of Rugby Union foot-
ball known a better team than the All-
Blacks of that year ? They were the
finest Rugby Union combination ever seen
in these parts, every forward a skilled
back, and a huge sprinting gentleman at
that. And only one try was scored
," s against them in their several Sydney
| matctieS. But attack in concert by the
local backs of that period was hardly so
variable and penetrative as it is to-day,
though the quality of the defence was
much better. Anyhow, the 1903 team’s
stars became the stars of the better-
known and more famous All-Blacks of
1905, and the basis on which that, the
greatest Rugby combination —measured
by results—the world has seen was built.
Mr. Richard Arnold, looking very well,
Messifc. H. Y. Braddon, H. D. Wood, J.
R. Henderson, Tom Pauling (one of the
1897 All-Blacks), J. McMahon, George
(Jumbo) Walker, Hyam Marks (who
played for Australia against Mullineux’s
team in 1899), I. C. O’Donnell (who skip-
pered New South Wales so many times
against all manner of opponents), R. A.
Warren (of the 1886 N.S.W. team in New
Zealand), T. P. Carr (who keeps young
by following the game of his sons), D.
Waiker, Edward (Happy) Eyre (whose
son was among the possibles for the
team) Malcolm McArthur, W. W. Hill,
C. E. Murnin, Dr. H. M. Moran, Frank
Row, Dr. W. F. Matthews, E. E. Booth,
J. Clarken, and H. R. Baird were
among a few sighted in the crowd. There
were lots of other Rugby brigadiers of
old. .Their cup of pleasure would have
been filled if the home backs could have
defended with skill in keeping with the
general form shown by the sturdy eight
who made the scrummage.

The Royal Australian Military Col-
| lege team appeared in the Referee on
Wednesday.
Thi All Blacks overwhelmed the Man-
ning River Branch 70 to 9 on Wednes-
day. )
New Zealand footballers always com-
mence their tour in these parts with
victory, and. of course, the team now
with us did not depart from the cus-
tom. They won by a fair margin, yet
supporters of the' Blues found much in
the football of the home team to give
them pleasure. N.S. Wales will go on
the field to-morrow with practically an
even-money chance of victory, in the
, opinion of most of the fans of tht
Rugby Union. Seldom has a Rugby
U nion following left the ground after
, the opening match against N.Z. so
1 satisfied and full of confidence regarding
coming games. Probably 1907 was the
only occasion. Then the All Blacks,
under Jimmy Hunter, won by 11 to 5,
, but Waddell, the speedy winger from
'Varsity, actually crossed the line twice
[ with the ball in his possession, but was
i forced into touch in goal, and in other
respects the Blues were unfortunate. So
‘all went out again on th e Wednesday
‘brimful of optimism which was just-
ified for Messenger and Co. beat the
Blacks pointless (14-0). It had only
happened once previously that the
flower of N.Z. Rugger had failed to
.score against their opponents. That was
in the famous match against Wales in
1905. And it has happened but once
since when Australia won 11 to nil in
1910. The return game in N.S.W. has
often proved fatal to the visitors, and
history has a habit of repeating itself.
A CREDITABLE RECOVERY.
It surprised many who have not been
keeping in touch with games under the
old code to see the fine form of the
Blues despite the many defections suf-
fered in recent years. Good players
were being lost very regularly and the
chance of a recovery did not appear
bright. The A.I.F. team was expected
to become the nucleus of a fine side,
especially with their brilliant forwards,
,but some of these were lost. It was
therefore somewhat of a surprise to see
the standard of play so much in ad-
vance of that of 1919. The selectors.
Dr. Matthews, H. R. Baird and T. H.
Bosward, are to be congratulated on
getting together such a capable team.
At full-beck Dr. Beith played finely.
We did not see him with the soldiers
last Winter, and when told he was
superior to the Geelong player, Rankin,
who had such a liking for dropping-
goals, we realised the ex-’Varsity player
must be a champion. He has given
some excellent displays in club football
and more than maintained this form in
the big game.
Lawton revealed alb the trickiness in
attack shown in premiership games, but
was hardly solid enough in defence. It
was fortunate for him that the N.Z,
captain was not at his best, taking
passes and handling the ball generally,
otherwise the stand-off halves of the
Blacks might have found their wav
through. Lawton has now joined the
band who have represented both
Queensland and New South Wales at
Rugby Union. With Bananaland out of
the game the list should be practically
completed now. R. L. Raymond, the
strong-running University centre, and
Wogan were the best of the three-
quarters.
NSW ZEALANDERS’VrRENGTH.
A very fine 1 well-balanced side are the
men from Maoriland —good hustlers in
the forwards and smart in the backs.
The two wing three-quarters created a
very fine impression. Storey received
more opportunities in the first term,
and Steel received the chances after
the interval. The latter was very bril-
liant and Sydneysiders will be glad to
see him again. Beiliss and Carroll
were to the fore in every rush in the
forwards. In line-out play the Blacks
were the superiors of the home side.
A POPULAR MANAGER.
No New Zealander In charge of pre-
vious teams made himself more popular
than Captain T. H. Jones. Naturally
delighted to win on Saturday, he was
unstinted in his praise of the home
! team's play, and he meant every word
he said. In no earlier visit has the *
selection of referee been carried out i
so happily by the All Blacks. When «i
the names were submitted to Capt. Jones i
he decided to make no distinction, but
*to give the three a chance, so Bosward,
Brown and Randle will all be heard
with the whistle. E. C. Brown, an old
Eastern Suburbs player who has been
showing fine control in the games he
has been handling, is always up with
play and prompt, in his decisions, he
i should b e qifite up to the big contest.
: Freddy Randle is a man of many
I parts, an able referee, and old swim-
ming enthusiast, and the life and soul
of the Sydney Bicycle and Motor Cycle
Club, for whom he produces a very
readable monthly magazine.
To-morrow’s contest will be preceded
by one between Royal Australian
Military College and University. The
Duntroon cadets are brilliant foot-
ballers. They showed it in their pre-
vious visits and as most of last year’s
players are still in the team we can con-
fidently expect something.
TO-MORROW’S TEAM.
There have been some alterations in
both the New South Wales and New
Zealand teams. In the home team
Chambers, Elliott and Marrott have
been replaced by Farquhar, Wyld and
McKay. The backs will be strength-
ened by the alteration. The visitors
have omitted Badeley, Jacobs and Car-
roll, who give way to Algar, Shearer
and Hasell. Beiliss will play wing' for-
ward in lieu of the Maori. Some of
the visitors are suffering minor injuries
as a result of the first contest. The

ALL BLACKS VISIT.
VICTORY AT SYDNEY*
SYDNEY, Saturday—The firrt All Black
Rugby Uniou combination to visit Austra-
lia since 19i4 played the opening match
of the tour this afternoon at th© Sydney
Sports Ground. The teams were: New

forwards. Carroll, Duncan, Moffitt, West.
Beilis. Baird, Donald. Referee, Mr. T. H.
Bosward.
Shortly before the big game commenced
the Governor and Dame Margaret David-
son arrived. Considering the importance
of the match, the attendance was small, a
strong indication that there ia little possi-
bility of the Union game again booming.
When the sturdy New South \V a tollmen filed
on to the fields followed by the big New
Zealanders, it was estimated that there
were about 8000 people present. Tilyard,
the All Blacks’ captain, carried a kewpie.
The New Zealanders paced the main
pavilion, and gave their war cry. Jacobs,
the burly Honowhenue player, was the oniy
Maori in the team.
The game commenced by the Welshmen
immediately attacking. Wogan intercep-
ted a pass in the centre of the field,
speeded goalwards. and punted over the
lull-back’s head, but fell in the race for
tho ball. Bradley started the invaders
by dodging his way through to th© blues,
where he was upended.
NEW ZEALAND SCORE FIRST.
The play was soon snifted to the All
Blacks’ quarter, where a scrum near the
line looked dangerous, but a line puiet
saved tnsm. Beiliss started a vreat drib-
bling rush. Near half-way the 1 all
bounded into his hands, and he whipped
it to Baird, who dashed across. Roberts
converted, and New Zealand led by 5 to
nil.
Play had scarcely been resumed when
Steels, a speedy winger, put in A fast
run, and almost got over. Play of
scraggy nature followed in the centre of
the field. Things looked unfavourable for
New Zealand, the gam® continuously being
in their territory. Again fiellisa figured in
a short dribbling rush, and, picking up,
punted short ana crossed at the corner.
Roberts added two more points, and the
All Blacks were 10 to nil.
The New Zealanders were penalised, ai d
Wogan failed in an attempt at goal. Activi-
ties were transferred to the Welshuc
25, where Donald took part in a fine rush,
and sent a forward pass to Brad'ey. The
Blues again attacked. Chambers and Molten
were prominent in a splendid dash. Cham-
bers toed past Steele and O’Brien. YW.gan
gathered the ball and went over, i twluo
tncKeo a great goal, and the New Zea-
laode.ro led by 10 to 5.
Elliott cross-kicked right into a nest of
All Blacks. Storey secured, and sent a
good pass. The ball came back to Storey,
who scored an easy try. Roberts failed
at goal.
W alker secured, and. sent to Lawtoo, who
to Raymond. The latter was
hela up, but he cot in a good pass to
i scored. and converted his try.
Ail Blacks pot? had a lead of 13 to Id.
Scarcely had the game been resumed ,
when the giant New Zealand forwards
made a sweeping dribbling rush. The Welsh-
men stumbled badly. Carroll picked up and
sent to Beiliss, who again scored. Roberta
failed to convert, and the New Zealanders
led by 1/5 to 10. The blues’ tackling w&a
deadly, they going solidly for their op-
ponents’ legs. At half-time the scores
were: New Zealand 16 points. New South
Wales 10 point 3.
FAST AND OPEN PLAY OF NEW
ZEALAND.
The game was fast and open. The use
of a reserve ball was to a great extent
responsible for this. In the 9econd spell
the Welshmen had the sun in their eyes.
The New Zealanders —particularly Carroll,
Beiliss, Baird, and Donald—proved their
reputation of being great forwards-. Mayna
sent a pass to Walker, who was *jing
along the touch line, but he fumbled-
Bradley snapped the ball up near half-
way, and. put in a wonderfully tricky
run. but was downed. The captain (Tib
yard) picked up, and the ball eventually
went to Duncan, who whipped to Steele.
The lattei raced from halfway. A tackier
grabbed him. but he fell over. Baird missed
the goal, and New Zealand led by 19 to
10.
A FINE FIELD GOAL.
.The All Blacks continued to attack, but
Were penalised. This relieved the Blues. Do
spite th© heavier weight of the New Zea-
land forwards the home team's backs held
them well. The game shifted to half-
way. where Ne\v South Wales were penal-
ised. but Roberts missed. Tilyard took
a long pass, and sent to Colby, who
dropped a fine field goal. New Zealand
led by 23 to 10.
Shortly* after Wogan panted, and Bar.
mond, following on, picked up and raoed
to the New Zealand 25. He passed to
Mayne, but the ball went a*tray. Fox.
however, was handy, and he picked up
and scored. Lawton converted, and the
score was. New Zealand 23 points, New
t South Wales 15. Then Donald scored for
New Zealand, but the goal was missed,
and New Zealand led by to 15. these
I being the final scores
ALL BLACKS AGAIN.
A WIN BY 31 POINTS TO 18.
The New Zealand Rugby Union footballers added
another scalp to their Bella by beating a New South
Wales Second Fifteen at the Sports Ground yesterday
afternoon.
After running up 8 points to nil in first half hour of
the game, the New South Wales side failed to score an-
ther point till the closing five minutes, when they
rattled up ten more. Bright, fast, and interesting at
first, the game in the latter part of the first and the
whole of the second degenerated into a scramble. Both
sides handled badly, New South Wales being particu-
larly noticeable in this respect. The tackling of the
home side, except in a few isolated cases, left much to
be desired. The outstanding man on the field was
Badeley, the New Zealand first five-eighth, who made
his reappearance after being injured in the first match.
Of the trio of wingers, Storey played well, but Steele
had few chances. Carroll and Jacobs, and easily dis-
tinguishable pair, stood out among the Black vangard.
Of the home side, the pick of the backs was undoubtedly
Mingay, who stood head and shoulders above his com-
rades, while among the forwards, Eyre -aijis the most
prominent. As an international contest, the game was
a poor one, and, since the ground was dry, there is no
excuse for the mulled passes, and far too frequent
failures to pick up the ball.
Mingay kicked off with the sun in his eyes, and the
New South Wales forwards dribbled to their opponents’
line, where Tilyard was compelled to mark. Baird, of
New Zealand, broke away, dribbling, but New South
B ales wero soon back attacking, and the Blacks were
compelled to force twice. In the centre, M’Donald
picked up, nad streaked ahead to the full back. He
lost the ball, but .Vlingay got it, and sent it out to
Friend, who scored near the touch line. Eyre failed
at goal. New South Wales kept on the offensive, but
twice certain scores were lost through faulty handl-
ing.
New Zealand now took a hand, and a good rush be-
tween Beilis, Wilson, Tilyard, and Storey ended in
the latter centreing to Beiliss, who had a clear field.
The ball bounced badly for him, however, and Dawson
saved. A find kick by Pym found touch in the
corner, and Mingay obtaining sent to Quinlivan,, who
scored between the posts. Mingay converted. Shortly
after Badeley picked up in thej N.S.W. half and,
beating the defence, scored a fine individual try.
Resell missed the goal. A good rush among the’
visiting backs ended on the N.S.W. line. Here a
free kick to the home team, which should have re-
lieved, hit a Black forward, and in the mix up
Hasell forced his way over, but again his kick was
pointless. They were in again almost immediately,
Baird scoring after a struggle on the line. This time
Hasell made no mistake, and at half time New Zealand
led by 11 to 8.
The second half opened- with a period of scrambling
play, both sides handling badly. Then the ball went
out to Storey in his own territory, he punted over the
opposition, followed up, and, after evading efforts
at tackling by Shute and Dawson, ran in under, the
bar. Ha.,ell converted. Following the drop out,
Badeley, playing finely, broke away on his own, but
Dawson tackled him well. There were several patches
of bright play. Eyre dribbled well down field, and
from an ensuing scrum Mingay came round on the
blind side, drew the defence, and passed to Pym,
who was pulled down just at the line. New Zealand
were penalised for illegal interference, but Mingay’s
kick, though a good one, fell short. Eyre once
more broke through well, but a forward pass spoilt
the movement he initiated. Back at centre again,
where Badeley obtained, and beat the defence a second
time to score at the goal. Hasell converted. They
, came again in a few minutes. Wilson ran well, and
when tackled, passed to Carroll, who evaded a tackier
ond scored for Hasell to goal once more. Shortly
after Dawson fielded a kick, but the übiquitous Carroll
took the ball out of his arms and scored for Hasell to
again convert.
New South Wales tired of their role as defenders
and attacked. Byrnes snapped the bail up in New
Zealand’s half and cutting in well gave to Piggott,
who scored. Mingay’s kick was successful. From the
drop out the forwards dribbled down field, and Friend
j picked up in tire ruck, and crossed in. Mingay’s kick
made the score 31 to 18, but New South Wales’s rally
* had come too late, and when no side sounded soon
1 afterwards New Zealand had won with the scores un-
altered.
UNION TEAM Fait SATURDAY.
The selectors have chosen the following- team to re-
present New South Wales against the All Blacks at
the Sports Ground on Saturday: B. M. Beith (E.S.), A.
V. Ma.vne (G. 8.), L. W. Wogan (W.S.), T. Lawton
(Uni.), J. Shute (W.S.), N. Mingay (Manly), O. Humph-
ries (N.S.), W. T. Watson (G. 8.), J. Bond (G. 8.), T.
Davis (W.S.), C- Fox (N.S.), W. S. Friend (G. 8.),
I. W. L. Ormiston (Gunnedah), V. A. Dunn (Junee),
R. Marrott (E.S.); reserves, A. S. Walker (E.S.), R.
Chambers (Manly), G. Marshall (Urii.), G. R. M‘Kay
(Newtown).
Of the backs, Raymond, Farquhar, and Walker, of last
week’s team, are not included. Raymond is unavailable
on account- of examinations, and the selectors have sur-
mounted the difficulty by placing Lawton at inside-centre.
Mingay has played excellently in the two games this
week against New .Zealand, but Humphries, reserve in
the two previous New- South Wales games, has been
sitting on the line. He should know the All Blacks’
weak spot. In the forwafds, W. S. Friend displaces
Wild, of Manly. He has earned the position, like Min-
gay, on his form in the last two matches, and.
played in the second row with Fox in the metropolitan
tour to New England early in the season. The selec-
tors, after trying M’Kay last Saturday, have reverted
to R. Marrott for the breakaway position. M’Kay had
a great chanc® in the second game, when the ground
was heavy, but failed to make good.


New Zealand R.U. Team

Wins All Along the Line in Sydney
AUGUST 11, 1020
_With opposition in tne shape of” the
big G.P. Schools’ match, only about 2500
enthusiasts attended the final N.Z. ana
»N.S.W. game at the Sports Ground on
Saturday. A keen wind right across the
ground into the stands did not add to
the enjoyment of a dull game. The
Blacks fielded a team only slightly dif-
ferent from that which defeated the
Blues a week earlier, Brown, Shearer,
and Algar standing down for O’Brien,
Carroll, and Badeley. The home team
underwent several changes, Mingay, after
his good form during the week, replacing
Walker at half, and. Shute, Marrott, and
W. S. Friend also were included. Lawton,
the consistent Blue five-eighth, was re-
placed at the last minute by Chambers.
NEW ZEALAND.—,T. G. O'Brien, full-back ; J.
Steel, V. W. Wilson, and P. \V. Storey, three-
quarters ; J. T. Til yard (capt.) and C. E.
Badeley, five-eighths ; E. [Roberts, half-back ;
I. A. Beiliss, wing -forward • W. 1). Duncan, E.
W. Tlasell, J. E. Moffitt, A. H. West, D. T.
Baird. J. G. Donald, and A. Carroll, forwards.
NEW SOUTH WALES.—B. M. Beith, full-back;
A. A'. Mavne, 11. Chambers, L. W. Wogan, and J.
Shute, three-quarters ; N. Mingay, five-eighth ;
0. Humphreys, half-back ; W. T. Wat-on (capt.),
J. Bond, T. Davis. C. Fox, W. S. Friend, I. W.
L. Ormiston, V. A. Dunn, and It. Marrott, for-
wards.
BLUEjS SCORE FIRST.
The game opened with the sides tak-
ing turn in attacking, but with good posi-
tions being lost through weak handling.
The forwards mostly had control of the
game, and Moffitt, Hasell, and Carroll in
turn broke through, but the defence was
sound. Wogan, Chambers, and Shute
carried the ball to the N.Z. line, where
from a scrum Mingay passed to Hum-
phries, back to Mingay, who scored be-
tween the posts, and converted. N.S.W.
5 to nil.
The Blacks replied with a good run by
Storey, who beat Shute and passed to
Roberts for an easy try. N.S.W. 5-3.
Beith, playing grandly, saved several
times, but the Roberts-Storey combina-
tion was too good again, and the latter
put N.Z. in the lead, 6-5. After give and
take play, rendered lifeless through the
use of the line and bad handling, Storey
just missed taking a high punt, but Car- j
roll dashed up and racing through gave
to Steel, who made no mistake, and
scored between the posts. Roberts con- i
verted and half-time was blown with
N.Z. 11-5.
CLOSE SCORING.
*
A try seemed certain when six Blacks
got away with only the full-back to beat,
but the ball was dropped. Again Wilson
was unsupported, and a good chance lost.
Then .the Blues shone in a good rush,
Mingay cleverly beating the opposition
round the blind side, passed to Hum-
phries, to Mayne, back to Mingay, who
went over. Wogan goaled. N.Z. 11-10.
For a period the game became specta-
cular, with both sides playing better
football. Then Moffitt used his bulk
to advantage and Roberts kicked a mag-
nificent goal. N.Z. 16-10. From ruck 1
work Beiliss struggled over, and Roberts
again added the goal. Going at his top,
Steel was brilliantly tackled by Beith,
but fell with his left arm under him and
broke it. N.S.W. now returned to the
attack, and Fox punted high and Watson,
following fast, passed to Marrott, who
showed speed in getting over. N.Z. 21-15.
The same player beat the field in a solo
effort, but was interfered with by
O’Brien, in a good position. Just be-
fore full-time Beiliss was tackled by Beith
just short of the line. Mingay put his
foot to the ball, Roberts got it and
scored, placing N.Z. in the lead 24-13.
NOTES ON THE PLAY.
The game was not notable tor sparkle,
the Blacks only appearing to be willing
to keep the Blues out. This is hardly
surprising when their large number of
games in a. short time is taken into con-
sideration. It is quite possible that, had ■
the home team shown any polish in the j
backs, the men from New Zealand would
have had a defeat on their record ; but |
faulty handling and passing ruined many
good chances on both sides. The for-
wards seemed more at home with the
ball than the backs.
The weak link in the visiting backs
was Tilyard, who had every opportunity-
but, as a rule, either dropped the pass
or gave a bad one. With Roberts play-
ing a very heady game and making
splendid openings, the ball rarely got
beyond the captain, and throughout the
wiftgs were neglected. On several oc-
casions Roberts gave Steel and Storey
long passes, and got them moving ; but
the ball rarely went right through ail
the backs. Roberts, Steel, and Storey
were the best of the Black rearguard.
The home backs played fairly, and
started some very pretty rushes, but had
not the necessary polish to finish them.
The wingers played without the dash
which goes to make a first-class man in
the position, and did not seem to have
the experience to cope with their speedy
opponents. Beith, at full-back, was
sound, and once again proved his skill
in tackling. The star of the game was
little Mingay, whose form wa s truly first-
class. In both attack and defence he
was a tower of strength to the Blues,
getting the ball to his backs cleanly, •
making good openings, and judging the
right moment to pass. A fault with all
the home backs was the habit of passing
too soon, making it appear that indivi-
dually they did not want the ball, and
the sooner they got rid of it the better.
The forwards on both sides had a
great deal of heavy work, the Blacks
using their weight to great advantage.
Beiliss and Moffitt were very prominent, ,
and among the Blues, Marrott, by his
fine running and following-on, earned
the honors with Dunn, Ormiston and
Bond close up.
Both sides played the line too mucn,
though the strong wind may be blamed
to a certain extent ; but, generally,
players preferred to kick out rather than
risk what: looked a very fair opening.
The referee, F. A. Randle, wa s very
keen, but in scoring his second try Min-
gay obviously knocked-on. The most
palpable error was, however, when Beiliss
was tackled and grounded the ball just
short of the line. Roberts, following on,
took a pass from the man on the ground
and ran over to be awarded a try.
Steel, the crack New Zealand wing,
unfortunately dislocated his elbow in the
second half, and was conveyed to the
hospital.
N.S.W. SECONDS ALSO BEATEN.
The New Zealand teams fourth game
of the tour against N.S.W.’s second fif-
teen on Wednesday last at the Sports
Ground, was not a very inspiring con-
test. The home team led at one stage
by 6 to nil, but when the visitors exerted
themselves to the fullest they quickly
went to the front. Towards the close
N. came again scoring two con-
verted tries very rapidly, but the All
Blacks always held the game safe, and
won by 30 to 18. For New’ Zealand
Hasell (2), Carroll (2), Wilson, Storey
and Badeley scored tries, Hasell con-
verting five. For N.S.W. W. S. Friend
(2), Quinlivan and Pigott crossed, Min-
gay converting three. F. Huthnance
refereed.

GOSSIP FROM NEW ZEALAND.
Here are a few items from The Referee
N.Z. correspondent:
The Wellington Rugby R.U. F.C. held
a dinner and smoke concert to celebrate
its jubilee. This club—which bears the
name of the Empire City—was the first
club formed here, the game itself being
first played in Wellington in 1868. The
gathering was very enjoyable, a great
number of old-timers being present.
The Marist Old Boys having won the
championship of the Canterbury Rugby
Union ordinary games have been aband-
oned.
In splendid weather recently at Gis-
borne the Te Aute College met Gisborne
High School in the preliminary round for
the Moascar Cup competition, and won
by 13 points to 3. The game was fast
throughout, and was the most attractive
exhibition of Rugby seen in Gisborne
this season. For the winners tries were
scored by White, Peina, and Tibbie, two
being converted by Peina and Pine. Te
Arawau scored for Gisborne.
In New Zealand the North Island
country districts are being toured by a
South Island country team:—August 5..
v. Wairarapa, at Carterton; August 7, v.
Hawke’s Bay, at Napier; August 11, v.
Manawatu, at Palmerston North; August
14, v. South Auckland, at Hamilton; Au-
gust 21, v. Bay of Plenty, at Rotorua;
August 25, v. Thames and Goldfields at
Thames; August 28, v. Auckland,' (at
Auckland.
This is an excellent idea, providing
good football and sport for country
players and incidentally helping to deve-
lop their abilities.
With the New Zealand Rugby Union ,
footballers giving a good display in the ]
opening engagement, there were expecta-
tions of an increase in popularity for
the return match, but only 7500 viewed
the game on Saturday. Play was very
disappointing. The heavy ground was cer-
tainly responsible for much of the falling
off but after making due allowance for
this, better Rugger was expected. New
Zealand found it necessary to alter the
team. Roberts, at half-back, was an
improvement on C. Brown, who was
changed to the full-back position, but
the five-eighths wpre not up to the
standard one has been taught to expect
from Maoriland. Algar, here and there,
showed neat individualism, but Tilyard
was faulty. Perhaps Australians, hav-
ing seen Hunter, Mynott, Stead, Wood,
Duncan and other brilliant black-jer-
seyed five-eighths, have become too
exacting. The two wing three-quarters
were again fine. In this position, the
present team compares very favorably
with its predecessors. Beiliss—wing-
forward on this occasion—Donald and
Baird, were the ablest of the forwards.
If the play of the visitors was not up
to standard, that of the home team dis-
appointed to a greater extent. Beith
was very good despite the handicap of
the greasy ball. He made one serious
error in tackling when he failed to stop
Beit, but generally his work was
without fault. The forwards were fair.
The altered rules were appreciated,
but none, is effective in removing
illegalities." If a side is not permitted
a second kick from where the first lands
when the kicker has been interfered
with, at least some provision should be
made to give touch-judges power to
report infringements. It was stated be-
fore the coming of the Northern Union
game to Sydney, that rushing players
could hardly prevent themselves coming
into contact with an opponent after he
had got rid of the ball. This was quickly
exploded when the drastic law of the
new body was put into operation. A
referee cannot always watch closely the
happenings in these instances. He has
to keep his eye on the ball, but touch-
judges rapidly steady an offender. It is
so easy to escape detection 4n the Rugby
Union rules that a referee would almost
be justified in inflicting the severest
penalty when a player is discovered.
Whether referee R. C. Brown —one of
the ablest in club games—was having
his first experience of a wing-forward
one doesn’t know, but frequently the
ball, after being placed in the scrums,
was kicked out —forward —to Beiliss, who
whipped it away. As the official has
power to order the ball to be put in the
scrum from either side he may choose,
there were many occasions when he
should have exercised it. After leading
8 to nil at half-time, New Zealand won
by 14 to 6.

VIS3TQRS COMMENCE WELL.
After some even play the Blacks at-
tacked, bouts between Beiliss, Roberts,
and Tilyard and a number of good in-
dividual bursts by Roberts being mainly
responsible. In a good position the for-
wards heeled to Roberts, who came
around close to the scrum and passed
to Beiliss, vfho went across. Roberts
converted —5 to nil. The half-back was
doing excellent work for N.Z. Once,
following a high punt smartly, hfc jumped
and took the ball practically out of
Beith’s hands, and was only brought
down in the corner. The Blues came
along a little later. One piece of passing
by the backs was stopped through
Mayne knocking on. New Zealand’s
second try came just before the interval.
First Beiliss and Baird headed an attack,
then from a scrum Roberts passed to
Algar, to Tilyard, to Steel. Going hard
he shook off both Raymond and Beith,
crossed in the corner, and went around
almost to the posts. Half-time, N.Z.
8 to 0.
QUIET FOOTER CONTINUES.
* Play resumed rather tamely, then, after
a Black attack ended with Roberts fail-
ing at goal, Dunn, and Fox
changed the scene to N.Z. territory,
where Lawton landed a penalty goal—
8-3. Farquhar, whose showing was be-
low his club form, figured jn a sprint
along touch, but a dash by 'Brown and
Hasell sent N.S.W. back to half-way.
Soon the visitors scored again, Algar,
Tilyard and Storey were in the rush, the
—
last-named crossing—a good try; 11-3-
They soon came again, with Storey once
more finishing the rush —14-3. Towards
the end the Blue forwards heeled to
Walker, who dashed around the blind
side and kicked in-field. Bond, who had
come away smartly from the front row,
snapped up the ball and went across.
Lawton failed at goal. N.Z. won an un-
eventful game by 14 points to 6-

Keen Rugby League Games :
Boxing Championships r
The Amateurs
(By The Referee Special.)
WELLINGTON, July 15.
RUGBY {FOOTBALL.
The oniy defection from the N.Z. R.U.
team in Australia was M. Cain (Tara-
naki), who declined the trip. The place
was then offered to L. O’Leary, a young
and promising forward from South Can-
terbury, but he had the bad luck to in-
jure his foot. J. Shearer (Wellington)
fills the vacancy, and the team suffers
nothing by his inclusion. He should
nave been in the side from the jump, for
he i s a fine, hard-working forward, and
one rarely found on our Rugby fields to-
day, viz., an expert dribbler. Time was
when the dribbling forward was a fea-
ture of Rugby football, but he has gradu-
ally dropped out of the game and given
way to the hard-kick and follow variety.
Because Shearer has developed the drib-
bling habit, there should have been no
doubt about his selection.
The New Zealand team's gallop in
Auckland against the Aucklanders was
interesting. Between 1914 and 1920 no
International New Zealand R.U. team
has been selected, though th e Expedi-
tionary Force team kept their country s
color s flying in the forefront of military
football. Consequently, the appearance
in Auckland of the 1920 All Blacks was
an event of note, and their match against
Auckland drew between 10,000 and 12,000
spectators, the finest crowd that Eden
Park has seen since it became a site for
Rugby representative matches.
The New Zealand fifteen that took the
field had undoubtedly strong, fast, clever
backs and big, smashing forwards, aver-
aging over 13lst and fast. The Auck-
land team opposed to them had not the
same weight, but they had the advan-
tage of combination, and their speed
gave hopes that the All Blacks would be
extended.
The conditions upset all calculations,
and gave spectators and players first a
dry spell and then a wet spell, with a
totally different style of game in each.
Starting off with the ball dry and the
ground in fair order, though soft and
heavy, the All Blacks gave a display of
smashing forward rushes, and flashes of
handling, with occasional individual
dashes, which promised that they can
become a great side once they shake to-
gether. Auckland had a bad half-hour in
the early half of the game, and tries
were put on as the result of fine forward
work by Carroll and McLean, while a
brilliant handling bout of out-and-in
passing resulted in Algar scoring a try
that Baird converted. In the meantime
Auckland’s only score was a penalty goal
by V. Badeley.
The story was changed when, after a
heavy rain, the tearhs took the field for
the second spell. New Zealand had been
unfortunate to lose Moffitt, their lock
man, with a bruised rib, towards the
close of the first spell, his place in the
scrum being taken by McLean, and Bei-
liss coming on the field. After this Auck-
land saw more of the ball in the scrum,
where they had been badly beaten be-
fore. Without this control the Auck-
land forwards proved a formidable pro-
position in the mud. Bunching and
dribbling in massed formation, the Auck-
landers time and again broke through
the opposing pack, and the New Zealand
backs showed a decided disposition to
stand off the rush-stopping. Lucas,
Alexander, Singe, Fletcher, and Taylor
were repeatedly prominent in leading
these breaks, and were well backed up
by Ross, Prussing, and Grierson, while
Kingston played a great game at full-
back. One of these repeated dashes
ended in Lortias scoring a try, after
O’Brien appeared to have been illegally
pushed **a way from the ball. Badeley
! converted. A little later a similar try
by M. Hayward made the scores even.
The rest of the game was fiercely con-
tested, with Auckland having quite the
better of the argument ; but no further
score was put on.
On Wednesday the New Zealand team
beat a combination from the Wanganui,
Manawatu and Horowhenua Unions at
Palmerston North by 39 to 0. Tries were
scored by McLean (2), Donald (2),
Badeley (2), Algar, Wilson, Storey and
Steele. Carroll converted two and
O’Brien one, and Wilson kicked a
penalty goal.
In Wellington Petone are now leading
for the championship, with Poneke
Athletic in the second and third, posi-
tions.
Strange are the ways of selectors. A
H. Singe, who made a great name with
the New Zealand Army team as a wing
forward, was not selected for the North
Island team, Lucas, a fellow Aucklander
being preferred. In the match between
Auckland and New Zealand last Saturday
Singe was played in the Auckland team
as wing forward and Lucas in the scrum-
mage. Therefore the remark, “Strange
are the ways of selectors,” for if Singe
had been selected as the wing forward
or the North Island team he would un-
doubtedly have been in the New Zealanc
team.

New Zealand Rugger Team
Amateur All Blacks Arrive : SliouM
Equal Pre-War Standard
I PARTICULARS OF THE PLAYERS.
J. G. O’Brien plays full-back for the Marist
Old Boys’ Club in Auckland, and in the Inter-
Services Championships in England in 1919 won
much prise from English critics. He was full-back
in the New Zealand team which toured Australia
in 1914, and also in the New Zealand Army tour
Of South Africa after the New Zealanders had won
the King's Cup. O’Brien is sure in taking
the hall, has that little bit of pace necessary to
get out of a tight corner with a short dash, and
finds touch with a serviceable kick.
P. W. Storrey, one of the discoveries of war
Rugby, is a champion wing three-quarter, and
would hold his own in any company. Dashing and
fast, with a pair of hands in picking up the ball,
Storrey has the ability to make much fine play
without the way being made easy by men in front
of him. He is also built on the sturdy side, a
good essential for a man who wants to brush the
last opponent out of the way in bis dash for the
line.
B. Algar is a pupil of the great William James
I Wallace. At one time Beat promised to go as far
as his clubmate did in the world of Rugby.
He has abilities and cleverness, but just fails, for
some reason or another, to rise to true greatness.
At five-eighth or centre three-quarter he is
equally at home, and with beautiful side-step
makes a lot of headway. But —and it is a big but
—a passing rush of Poneke Club backs generally
finishes at Algar. That is his weakness —not
being able to properly gauge the. right time to
make his pass—and when he loses it he will be a
champion.
J. Steele comes from the wild and woolly West
Coast, and was unheard of, except in his own
district, until he took part in the inter-island
match at Wellington last year. Playing for a
beaten side, he scored two brilliant tries by dash
and cleverness, and since has been voted by every-
body a certainty for this New Zealand team. He
could not be left out on his form in the game I
am referring to, though he did nothing startling
last Saturday.
Y. S. Wilson. ..A competent authority declares
that he is tbs bestowing three-quarter Auckland
has produced'for many a long year. I don’t think
Wilson would thank the authority for it. for he is
an unassuming lad. Memory travels back oyer
the years, and names like R. Whiteside, C. Madi-
gan, E. McCausland, F. M. Jervis, G. W. Smith,
H/G. Absolum, W. E. H. Mackenzie, J. A. War-
brick, W. Warbrick, J. Breen, J. V. Macky, F.
R. Wilson, R. McGregor and W. T. Wynyard come
readily to one, but still the greater majority of
them are a long way back. Wilson is the main-
stay of the College Rifles team, the jiresent Auck-
land champions. He scored two tries in the
inter-island match last year, but last Saturday ndt
one solitary attacking opportunty came his way.
With all due respect to the authority mentioned,
1 think Wilson will be the extra three-quarter.
C. E. Badeley is a delightful little player to.
watch. He makes his run straight every time,
and directly he makes the opening shoots out the
ball. These are the essentials that go to the
making of a class five-eighth—l don’t like the
player who tries to run round and jams the men
behind him out to the touch-line, or the one
that keeps going until it is better for the side
for him to bold the ball than pass it. Badeley’s
methods get the men behind him going to good
purpose, for they know they will get the ball,
with the opportunity of making the most of it.
J. T. Tilyard (captain). Although there is not
much of this Poneke player, he is, with the ex-
ceptions probably of Cain, Hasell and Moffiitt, the
veteran of the party, and the remarkable part is
that he is playing better football this season than
at any previous time in his career. He has a
nippy, straight run. and passes neatly and quickly
to his followers. He was a member of the New
Zealand team defeated by Australia in Christ-
church in 1913.
E. Roberts was a member of the 1913 New
Zealand team, which toured California, and the
1911 team to Australia. He is a son of Harry
Roberts, the 1834 New Zealand team half-back,
but is no relation of Fred Roberts (All Black
half) or W. Roberts (1897 New Zealand centre
three.-quarter). although the quartette have all
been bom in Wellington. Ted is a good half, but
not as brilliant as Fred, of that ilk, and prefers
the five-eighth position to half. I consider him
a fine utility back, for be has the happy knack of
knowing where the play is going, and generally
,gets in the road of the ball. But he is a better
half-back than a five-eighth, for the reason that
in the latter position he is inclined to run across
the field. But he is a clever ani resourceful
player.
C. Brown is a very useful half-back, although
he will probably be understudy to Roberts on
tour. He played twice for New Zealand against
Australia—in Dunedin and Christchurch—in 1913,
and took part in the inter-services championship
in 1919, besides acting as captain of the New
Zealand Army team n the South African tour. If
the selectors had taken the form in the inter-
island match into account D. M. Sandman (She
South halO would have been preferred to Brown.
And if such had happened it would have been a
unique thing, as Sandman has already represented
New Zealand in an Australian tour at cricket, and
it would have been a big feather in his cap to
have won the honor at Rugby.
As to the forwards, they are as fine a body of
sturdy young New Zealanders as I have ever seen,
and for stamina and physique will bear favorable
comparison with the All Black vanguards of the
part' It was a delight to see them stripped—
beefV brawnv. and full of muscle, fit to play for
a kingdom. What the selectors thought of them
is guaged from the fact that they picked both
rets of front-rankers in the inter-island game, and
their biggest trouble must have been not who to
put in the touring team but whom to leave out oi
it*
E. A. Beilis, from Taihape, is a find of the war,
and is a great forward. He scored two tries on
Saturday in brilliant style.
J V ' Moffitt. the lock of the scrummage, pro-
portioned after the style of W. Cunningham, the
pivot of the All Black scrum. The remarkable
'n;r~ rtnoui Moffitt is that he was apparently done
.a a Ru-rby player when he went on active ser-
vice, and the camp life, physical drill and so
on so developed him that he was accounted one of
the best forwards that took part in the Army
Services competition. And when this New Zea-
land team wa3 picked nobody doubted that be
would be given control of the scrummage.
A H West. 0. Fletcher, D. 1. Baird and F
MoT.ec n are all fine forwards, Fletcher being, if
anything, the best of the quartette. A Carroll
and W Duncan will take it turn about going
down in the front with Cain, with the pre-
ference lor the former. He is a stocky little chap
with a fiery forelock that singles him out for
Maori, and a splendid specimen
of New Zealand’s native race. be-
times as wing-forward and at others at five
egl th “ club matches, and this gives him the

than Carroll—captained the Wellington College |

By 20 to 11

New Zealand continued the sequence of
victories by defeating Metropolis at the
University Oval on Monday about 4000
witnessing a hard game, in which the
home team led by 3 to nil at half-time,
but were surpassed afterwards and beaten
by 20 to 11.

G. AVyld, W. S. Friend, G. Marshall and T.
Davis, forwards.
Opening with the Blacks attacking the
hospital end, play was lacking in brilliant
touches. It was hard at times, but never
very entertaining. The N.Z. forwards
did not appear to take matters quite so
seriously as in other games. M ingay land-
ing a penalty goal, Metropolis led 3-0.
Farquhar spoiled a few attacking move-
ments through not running with the de-
termination of his club football, and
Shute, on the other wing, twice dashed
back into the thick of the Blacks when a
sprint for the corner might have brought
tries. Half-time, Metropolis 3-0.
quick scoarrw.
Resuming, Roberts played at half-back,
Brown going to full-back and Algar tak-
ing up the five-eighth position. The
Sydney players soon scored. Raymond
broke away near centre and passed on the
right to Wogan, to Shute, who ran well
into the twenty-five and threw the ball in
over the head of Storey to Wogan, who
scored, but Mingay failed. 6 to nil. Then
the Blacks began, and in ten minutes
they had the lead. Storey and Steel
crossed with tries, and Roberts converted
one. Till near the end they had the
best of play generally, and tries were got
by Algar, after great passing, Moffit—
; after Jacobs had followed up and grabbed
the full-back in goal—and Steel two more,
mainly through Farquhar being out of
j position. A great run by Wogan fol-
-1 lowed by loose play finished with a. try to
Marrott, which Mingay converted. N.Z.
20, Metropolis 11.
\ N.Z. BACKS IMPROVED.
The second half redeemed the first.
The N.Z. centres and five-eighths showed
their best Sydney form to date, and the
forwards in the second half played with
vigor. Among the home team Farquhar
was the weak link both in attack and de-
fence. Wogan was the pick of the backs.
The forwards, though playing well,
missed Watson to lead them. F. J. Her-
lihy handled the game well.
From what I have written it is hardly
necessary for me to refer further to the
North v. South Island match in Wel-
lington. The two teams delighted the
spectators with the fine exhibition both
individually and in combination. North
Island won by 12 (two tries by Beilis,
try each by Barker and Fletcher), South

(By RAMBLER)
Sydney Rugby enthusiasts will renew
acquaintance on Saturday next after s
years—mainly stormy ones—with a r
presentative Rugby team from. New Zca
land. Time was when the visit of the
famous players from across the Tasman
would delight all footballers, and cnJ ™
Sasm regarding the _ game would be
worked up for weeks m advance. Now,
however, the forces of Rugger in Sydney
are divided, with the old code the les*
popular, though in the Dominion it still
has the greater grip on the public. How-
ever, New Zealand is a mystic name in
Rugby, and notwithstanding any
away 7 the side now with us should take
the field at the Sports Ground before a
great gathering.
THE N.S.W. TEAM.
Major Matthews, H. R. Baird, and T.
H. Bosward have reduced their
of 22 to the necessary 15. It is a goo.
side very representative of the btate,
though there will be criticism here and
there. If Mayne show no weakness in
defence, the backs ought not to
point. The solidity and all-round ability
of Humphreys would have been an asset,
but the" selectors’ task was not an en-
viable one. A. Walker showed signs oi
becoming a half-back resembling J
McMahon or Snowy Baker good, de-
pendable, gritty, but defensive, and lack-
ing in the rapid McKivat-like passing
that sets the backs moving. On the tour
through America he gave great promise.
If he demonstrates that years have not
brought stodginess, all wtll be weU
Dunn played ably in the mud at Mos
man on Saturday, and there should be
very little uncertainty regarding such a
brilliant forward. Ormiston also showed
out well. Evidently his form with the
AI F. though he was not in the best
eight in Sydney last year, was good
enough to satisfy Major Matthews and

Suburbs), full-back; A. V. Mayne (Glebe-

NEW ZEALAND OFFICIALS.
Apropos of the presence in Australia of
the New Zealand Rugby Union team, the
Referee N.Z. correspondent sends the fol-
lowing references to the men now respon-
sible tor the government of the game in
the Dominion:
A few notes about the men elected to
control the destinies of Rugby football
in New Zealand during the ensuing 12
months should be interesting enough to
print.
Mr. G. W. Slade (the retiring chair-
man) is the proprietor of a printing busi-
ness in Wellington. He came hither
from Taranaki, where he only had a
casual connection with the game. He
took hold of the affairs of the New Zea-
land Rugby Union when they were in a
state of “pi”—and has done fairly well
under the circumstances.
S. S. Dean is the Wellington manager
of the South British Insurance Com-
pany. While a resident in Poverty Bay
he was a prominent member of the
Rugby Union and Referees’ Association.^
R. T. Bailey is a factory inspector
under the Labor Department, and when
in Napier was a in the land
amongst the controllers of Rugby and a
leading referee.
J. T. M. Piki is an ex-Christchurch
resident, and played for the Merivaie
I Club them He was a member of one
of the Maori teams W. T. Parata took
to Sydney, where he had the misfortune
to break his leg, which accident finish :d
his career as an active player.
G. Howe and A, C. Kitto are well-
known business men in Wellington.
George Howe has played many parts in
Rugby—representative full-back, referee,
management committee, and so on —and
has done much good work. Dolph Kitto
is a keen enthusiast in amateur athletic
circles as well as Rugby.
~TFf.' Paton Ts 'frtß"’CiTTfei clerk inu!P
State Coal Department, a position that
carries with it a lot of worries these
days. He represented Otago (forward),
he gained a place in New Zealand
teams in Australia, and on settling
in Wellington played for the Oriental
Club for a while. Then he abandoned
playing for refereeing, and h2s won a
lot of praise.
T. H. Jones, re-elected hon. treasurer,
deserves the honor, as he is one of the
keenest enthusiasts Rugby has in the
Dominion, with a leaning towards
change.
A return presented at the New Zealand
Rugby Union’s annual meeting showed
that there were 20 unions affiliated to
that body, with 68 sub-unions and 20,064
players under their jurisdictions. This
return excludes primary schools.
Sydney Rugby Unionists awa.ted the
appearance of the New Zealanders with
a fair amount of if not actual uncer
tainty at least wonder, for six years
had elapsed since the Blacks had een
in Australia, and their rorm was not
definitely known to followers of „l_ e
game here, though the home skipper
(W. T. Watson) and others of the
Blues had met many of them m the
field at Bradford, where Australia com-
pelled the Silver Fern to acknowledge
defeat- Sydney was not kept long m
doubt, for the visitors showed them-
selves worthy representatives of the
great football country and though the
Blue went down, there was no dissatis-
faction at their display. When considera-
tion is given to the great inroads made
into the Rugby Union game within the
last ten years,, it will admitted that
a side which extended the Blacks a-
the home team did, played really ably.
Eleven points (26-15) divided 4e scores
at no-side, but it was admitted by tne
visiting manager that there was not this
margin on actual play.
With delightful weather, about 9500
visited the Sports Ground. Old-timers
were on every hand. The staunch ad-
herents to the old code were
about, each acting well his part. H. * •
Braddon and E. E. Booth, had worn
both the black and the blue.

tain), forwards. __
Referee, T. IT. Bosward ; touch judges, T. H.
Jones and J. C. Dunbar.
After the customary cheering, the New
Zealanders appeared about to dispense
with the war-cry, but the onlookers were
insistent, and headed by the Maori wing-
forward, Jacobs, they chgnted one new
to Sydneyites. Then the serious busi-
ness began with the visitors facing the
west side and a sun that handicapped
them. In the early scrums, the seven
pack secured possession, and Brown
showed himself a slick half-back. How-
ever, Wogan, by smartly intercepting a
pass from Roberts to Tilyard, changed
defence into attack. The local player
kicked up-field, but tripped when chas-
ing the ball. Play going across to the
southern touch enabled Storey to show
out. In the Interservices campaign he
made a name for himself, and onlookeis
were not disappointed in his first Syd-
ney appearance.
BURLY ONE MOVES GOALWARDS.
Already Beiliss, big of body and fleet
of foot, had shown great dash in the
open and again he broke through in a
piece of dribbling. The ball bouncing
was easily gathered by the Wanganui
player without slackening in his pace.
After continuing to the twenty-five he
passed out to Baird, who scored near the
corner. Roberts splendidly converted—
NEW ZEALAND, 6 TO NIL.
Here and there the Blues showed ous.
They were getting possession in the
scrummage, but the ball trickled out very
slowly to Walker. He tried to set Wogan
moving on the blind side, but the. Ho-
fence of Steel was too good. O’Brien s
line kick put the ball beyond centre, and
after a moment’s play here Beiliss again
secured, and racing on, scored a good
try. Another fine kick by Roberts neces-
sitated the referee consulting the touch-
judge, Jones, who raised the flag—New
Zealand 10—0.
N.S.W.’s TIT-FOR-TAT.
It was bright footer with the rapid
scoring of the visitors no indication of
the actual play. They were grasping
opportunities with typical New Zealand
readiness. The home team became ag-
gressive, and Lawton showed much
trickiness in attack. Again the black-
jerseyed men returned with Carrol) and
Beiliss in the van, but this time the de-
fence was impenetrable. After Brown
secured from the scrum the backs were
sailing goalwards wHen Tilyard (on the
twenty-five line) dropped a pass from
Roberts. Chambers burst through and
toed past the three-quarters near the left
wing. Wogan came up smartly, and kick-
ing hard, followed on and secured the
ball before reaching half-way. His kick
had beaten O’Brien, but Storey made a
determined effort to reach the Western
Suburbs skipper, who had cut in to the
goal. He slipped across right at the
post, just before the flying three-quarter
reached him. Lawton goaled—New Zea-
land 10 —5.


rot> THEM.
The Blues were soon at it' again, mak-
ing play along the left wing. Here
! near half-way, Elliott picked up, and
| kicking, almost straight across the field
j to the other side, gave a number of the
Blacks —practically unmarked—an excel-
lent chance of starting goalward again
Storey got the ball and attended by
Beiliss moved off at top speed. He
passed in to the forward, who continued
the good work, and sent it out again to
Storey, who scored the third try for the
visitors. This time Roberts failed—New
! Zealand 13— 5. They were missing noth-
! mg.
The home side was deterred by the
set-back, and soon attacked again The
forwards near the northern touch ’heeled
to Walker, who passed in on the right
to Lawton, on to Raymond. The old
Grammar boy shot across diagonally to
tne goai almost hurling himself across.
Right at the goal he passed out to Law-
ton (who had swung around outside his
clubmate), who crossed in an excellent
| position, and easily converted his own
| try—New Zealand 13—10.
N.Z. 16 TO 10 AT INTERVAL.
Interest livened with the reduction in
i mar J\n in favor of the Blacks, but
: u or f half ' tll ? e th e latter went further
anead. Carroll, a fine forward, was the
leader of a dribbling burst. Securing the
ball he passed to Beiliss— 'never very far
from the scene of action—and the great
forward scored. Roberts failed, and New
Zealand md 16—10 at the interval.
It was very attractive football, greatly
appreciated. In line-out work the visit-
xag forwards were somewhat superior to
the Blues, but again the 3-2-3 scrum for-
mation was proving better for securing
possession. However, this advantage was
practically nullified by the slow heeling.
When the Blacks hooked successfully the
ball came through much more smartly.
The home wing three-quarters were do-
ing their work well, but the centres were
hardly at their best. Five-eighth Law-
ton showed fine form in attack. Defen-
sively he was not up to the same standard.
BLACKS FORGE AHEAD.
In the second naif the sun troubled
the Blues more than it previously had
the visitors, Beith being particularly af-
fected by it. Time after time he would
shade his eyes with his hand in his en-
deavor to judge the flight of the ball.
Nevertheless he hardly made an error.
Lawton continued to show out in a
number of attacking movements, but the
Blacks were as solid as a brick wall.
They sent back the home team and Til-
yard, picking up, sent a long pass to
Steel, who obtained a good try, Baird
missing the goal left the figures 19 to 10
in favor of the Blacks.
The game was fast, with the visitors
showing the better cohesion. New South
Wales were aggressive again, and a pass-
ing bout between Walker, Lawton, and
Raymond appeared likely to bring points,
but the ’Varsity player’s transfer to
Chambers was intercepted by Jacobs,
and the scene changed very rapidly.
Play flitted from twenty-five to twenty-
five, always full of interest. Beiliss
chipped in with Storey in a dash only
to be sent back by Beith’s excellent line
kick. The Blacks returned and a de-
fender sent a low kick in-field. It went
to Tilyard in front of goal on the
twenty-five line, and the skipper dropped
a nice goal—New Zealand 28-10.
SCORING IN TURN.
The Blues were the next to cross.
Wogan kicking hard and racing after
the ball snapped it up and passed to
Raymond, who veered in across the
.centre and whipped a sharp pass, which
Mayne dropped. A moment’s stoppage,
then Fox secured and scored at the goal.
Lawton converted. N.Z., 23-15. New
South Wales died hard. They were at-
tacking till near no-side, when they were
sent back and Donald finished the visi-
tors’ scoring. Roberts failed at gaol,
New Zealand winning by 26-15.
STANDARD OF NEW ZEALANDERS.
“Well up to New Zealand standard,”
was the general view of the All Blacks.
Forwards and backs joined happily in
movements in the loose and the side is
well-balanced, and able in tactics.
O’Brien played cleverly at full-back,
kicking well and tackling soundly. The
two wings—Storey and Steel—figured in
many fine pieces of play. The former
was more prominent in the first term
with the latter at his best later. Each
possesses pace and runs strongly. One
j does not expect every New Zealand
j team to show us a Duncan, a Wood, a
Hunter or a Mynott in the five-eighth
position, nevertheless Roberts gave plea-
sure with his display, though he was
aided by Lawton’s uncertainty in de-
| fence. Tilyara was hardly the equal of
his fellow-five-eighth. Brown was smart,
and as a half-back shaded Walker. Onp
woulq not desire a finer forward than
Beiliss. We were told to expect much
from him, and he did not disappoint.
: Carroll, a great worker and always in
the dashes in the open; Baird, Moffitt
and the other forwards also did well.
Wing-forward Jacobs, big and fast, gave
a very good display.
HOME TEAM SHAPED ALL RIGHT.
The fifteen who wore the Waratah
justified the selectors’ confidence. As
Captain T. H. Jones, the manager of the
visitors stated afterwards, there was not
a margin of 11 points between the sides.
New Zealand had more readily grasped
opportunities. Beith played excellently
at full-back, and Lawton was smart in
making openings, though prone to take
the dummy. Bond hooked excellently,
and at different times all the forwards
shaped well in the open.
FOR THE RETURN MATCH.
To-day New Zealand will mee£ the
Manning Rugby Union team at Taree,
and on Saturday will play the return
match against N.S.W. at the Sports
Ground. Major Matthews, H. R. Baird,
and T. H. Bosward, at the conclusion of
Saturday’s game, selected for practice
the same fifteen, and O. Humphreys, C.
R. Farquhar, G. R. McKay, T. Wyld,
and F. Eyre. The final choice will be
made at the Sports Ground to-morrow
afternoon.
The Zandill Sisters
Delphine and Irene Zandill, the two daring
“human aeroplanes,” at Wirth’s Circus,
have met with innumerable thrilling experi-
ences “off stage” during their professional
career. On one occasion they were mem-
bers of a party of theatricals, who, whilst
returning from a steam yachting trip in Bar
Harbor, New York, had their vessel rammed
and sunk by a collier which broke its moor-
ings. They were in the only saloon car-
riage of a limited express which escaped
Mme. de Alma a elding (Wirths’
Circus)
being - wrecked by a collision on a steep grade
!in the Rockies, and, within a month, the
younger sister was capsized from a racing
automobile. But the most thrilling incident
of their career, and the only one in which
their professional talent helped their escape
from danger, occurred in Galveston, Pa.,
when they were occupants of a ten-storey
hotel, which caught fire at daybreak, through
a gasometer bursting. The sisters possess
a section of movie film showing both in the
act of sliding down, their hands being cov-
ered with motor gloves, a wire rope. They
regret, is their now smiling confession, that
it has never been possible for them to repeat
their daring act of that eventful morning,
as a show turn.
Wirth’s Big Circus.
There will be excitement for the child-
ren and entertainment for young and old
m Monday, September Ist, when the big
Arcus and menagerie owned by Wirth
Brothers Limited, and personally conduct-
id by the Wirths themselves, arrives in
Pittsworth. The special trains, three* in
umber, will bring the huge caravansary
0 town, in the early morning, and what a
mstle and shouting and trampling there
vill be as the five ponderous elephants
irag the lumbering waggons and. strings
ff animal cages from the station to the
jircus ground. Almost before one can
mm around the staff of a hundred work-
men employed by the circus will have
erected a canvas city of their own, cover-
ing an acre of ground, with 18,000 square
feet under canvas ; a huge “big-top” with
tier upon tier of seats to accommodate
thousands of spectators ; a great mena-
c gerie tent to house the elephants, lions,
tigers, bears, leopards, panthers, jaguars,
pumas, zebras, monkeys, seals, hyenas,
| and lynxes; stabling for 50 horses; an
engine and dynamo, with complete electric i
lighting and power plant; a kitchen and
mess tent; and half a dozen smaller tents,
used by tne circus company.. In the after-
noon, the menagerie, with all it 3 wonders
brought from foreign, heathen land and '
the waste spaces of the earth, all its en-
thralling interest and educational value,
; ke thrown open to the public for a
small charge to see the wild animals being
fed. At night will be thfi event of the
year for the children, aye, and for many of
the “children of a larger growth” ; for
who does not love the splendid horses and
their dashing jockeys and beautiful eques-
triennes ; the wonderful performing ele-
phants, as wise as most humans ; the rag-
ing lions, snarling at their tamer, yet
obeying his will; the marvellous feats of
the acrobats, and the drolleries of the
clowns ? Yet these are only the old stock
items of the circus programme. In addit-
ion, the Wirth Bothers will this year pre-
sent a galaxy of seven super-star attrac-
tions, imported at great cost, and with
tremendous difficulty, from America, where
Government permission had. to be obtained.
The Cevine Troupe, four ladies and two
gentlemen, run, dance, leap and somer-
sault on tight wires more easily than most
people could on the ground. The Three
Garcias acrobatic feats have astonished
three continents. The Zoe Sisters give a
spectacularly beautiful butterfly ballot in
mid-air. swinging from cords held in their
teeth.. The Flying Wihskills, with their
Charlie Chaplain Clown, provide a comedy
taapeze act. Leo Montfort, in the Loop
of Death, whirls around a fifty foot circle

Where love lives for ever —

MAULED TO DEATH
KILLED BY LEOPARD.
YOUNG ZOO ATTENDANT.
SPRANG ON BACK.
LIVERPOOL, June 25.
John Ashworth, 35-year-old zoo atten-
dant, was mauled to death by a leopard
he had loAed and cared for since its
birth. The beast’s name was Death.
Keeper Ashworth, before cleaning its
cage at Liverpool Zoo, Mossley Hill,
enticed it into the adjoining cage of
Satan, its mate. He slid to and locked
the iron communicating door before
cleaning Death’s cage.
Then he broke his usual rule. Instead
of leaving the male’s cage before open-
ing the connecting door he slid back the
door first.
He was not afraid when Death came
bounding out and crouched in a corner
behind him. Both leopards had eaten
out of his hands. He had cared for them
since their birth two years and a half
ago.
Keeper Ashworth moved towards the
sliding door calling softly to Satan.
Thinking the man was going to attack
its mate, Death gave a roar, sprang on
his back, clutched him with its great
paws, and buried its jaws in his neck.
A short distance away a hundred chil-
dren from Culcheth junior school were
watching a circus performance.
When their seven teachers took them
to see the animals a little later, they did
not know that the leopard they saw
pacing its cage and roaring had just
killed a man, or that the leopardess play-
ing with some sacking had. watched the
tragedy.
Mr. H. E. Rogers, owner of the zoo,
said, “Ashworth was passionately fond
of animals. Many times he has sat up
all night looking after some sick one.
He has taken small creatures home with
hi*» at night and kept them in his
bedroom.
“The leopards were his favourites.”
Ashworth was single and lived with
an aunt. A young woman friend who j
called to see him at the zoo collapsed
when she heard the news.

BRADMAN’S PLACE
AMONG GIANTS
So records stand to the credit of Don Bradman in
+i^ S a °^" er fii’st-class cricket, that there were few left for
. < A A o t !o tralian captain to break when he resumed batting today
with 248 not out m the third Test match at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground.
A.N astonishing feature of Bradman’s
phenomenal run-getting is that, al-
though he has been in first-class cricket
only since 1927-28, he has surpassed most
of the achievements of great cricketers
who played for much longer periods.
Bradman is now 28.
His principal records are:—
In Test Cricket
Highest score (334) in Australia v. Eng-
land Tests—at Leeds in' 1930
Most centuries (16) by Australian in
Tests (against England, South Africa,
and West Indies).

Tests against England.
Only batsman to score 300 in Test
against England— 334, at Leeds in 1930,
and 304 at Leeds in 1934.

Test —309 at Leeds in 1930.
Six scores exceeding 200 in Anglo-Aus-
tralian Tests— 334, 304, 254, 244. 232 and

in Australia, 1928-29.
Has twice made seven centuries in a 1
season in Australia. Hammond, who
performed feat once, is the only other
batsman to make so many. The seven
by Bradman, in 1931-2, were made in
successive matches —six of them against
the South Africans.
In 1929-30 scored a century and a
double century in one day in trial Test
match in Sydney—an unprecedented feat.

LITTLE GIRL KILLED.
Crushed by Railway Trucks.
BUSSELTON, Aug. 6—When she fell ,
between two railway trucks and was ter-
! ribly mutilated, Joan Enid Eastman (s£),
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. H. Eastman,!
i of Duchess-street, Busselton, was killed
■ instantly this morning. The accident,
which occurred when the unloading of
Wirth’s Circus was in progress, was wit-
nessed by a large number of women and >
children. :
With another little girl, Joan Eastman;
was standing on an empty railway track,.
which was part of a long rake, when,
. an elephant belonging to the circus which i
was being used for shunting purposes,,
■ caused the rake of trucks to move for-
‘ ward. As the trucks commenced to :
move, the two little girls attempted to
climb off. One child scrambled off the j
side and fell clear. Deceased, who evi- !
dently attempted to get off the end of •
the truck, fell between two of the trucks. 1
A wheel of one of the trucks passed 1
over the child’s head and body. Her -
head and neck were crushed, an arm:
was broken and one leg was almost j
severed. The truck, which was empty, |
weighed 11 tons. The accident occurred,
near the Kent-street crossing.
: An inquest was opened this afternoon;
before the Acting Coroner (Mr. G. L.
Edwards, J.P.) and was adjourned sine
die after the hearing of formal evidence
. from Samuel Charles West, traffic man-
ager of Wirth’s Circus.

A large number of people, including
dozens of children, witnessed the
tragedy.
Joan was the daughter of Mr.

weighed 11 tons.
The rake of trucks moved by the
elephant was about 100 yards iong.
DEATHS AT ZOO
ANIMALS AND BIBDS
INCIDENCE OF DISEASE
ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES
The extent to which animals and
birds are subject to the ailments that
afflict human beings is evident from an
analysis of the causes of stock losses
at the Auckland Zoological Gardens
as given in an appendix to the recently
published report for the year ended
March 31, 1937. Of 30 mammals which
died in that period, 10 succumbed to
various well-known diseases, while 40
out of 74 deaths among the birds were
due to similar causes.
Tuberculosis claimed a tiger and a
sea-lion, and two other sea-lions died
from broncho-pneumonia. This latter
disease also accounted for the death of
a blue duiker and a spider monkey. A
macaque monkey and two gibbon apes
succumbed to entiritis and a third gib-
bon died from an undetermined cause.
An ancient zebra, purchased in 1924
and suffering from a diseased leg, died
under anaesthetic when an operation
was being performed.
I Surplus Lions Destroyed
Three surplus lions for which there
| was no market and which were simply
j) 1 a charge on the institution, were among
i the seven animals destroyed. Two very
[ elderly monkeys were also killed, as
I was a diseased polar-sbear a red-
jj deer that was suffering from the effects
| of a rifle-shot wound.
A black lemur, which had been blind
for many months, was the only animal
I to die of old age. A coyote, a rhesus
monkey and a blue duiker were killed
jby other exhibits and two further
! animals, a polar bear and a red
kangaroo, died from accidents.
! Among the birds tuberculosis ac-
-1 counted for eight pheasants, four para-
| keets, three pea fowl and an emu
| chick. Two pelicans died of kidney
I trouble and 18 finches succumbed to
I entiritis.
Old Age and Accidents
| Only one bird was destroyed. Those
| which died of old age numbered 20,
J this total included a piping crow, a
I white cockatoo with a deformed beak, ,
land a wedge-tailed eagle.
I Five finches, a brush turkey and a
j pheasant were killed by other exhibits, j
I Victims of accidents totalled 15.
I Although mortality occurred among
I species of animals and birds, the total
I number of deaths was considerably
I below the normal rate for a year, and
gcompared more than favourably, on a
jproportiouate basis, with the mortality
lin overseas zoos. Mortality among the
animals was 9 per cent, which was the
lowest figure in the past 12 years.

ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT
MADDENED BEAST
A CIRCUS bull elephant
ran amok and killed
its keeper at Parkes late
last night
The keeper, Jack Drummett, 50,
of Perry’s Circus, was watering
the elephant when it turned and
gored him with its 2ft. tusks.
Drummett suffered terrible injuries,
including fractured skull, ribs, and arm,
extensive lacerations.
He was left bleeding on the ground
until his groans brought helpers from
the hotel near the circus tents, who
aroused circus hands.
Excited Animal
The excited animal charged the group
and crashed through four panels of
heavy fencing.
It lumbered up the street and
charged a policeman and a keeper
who attempted to divert it back to its
paddock behind the hotel.
Crowds which saw the circus last night
quickly returned to the street, but
shouts and warnings from the circus
i hands sent them to cover in shop fronts
and verandahs.
Circus hands released two ether docile
elephants to quieten the maddened beast.
Milling In Street
More than 50 gathered on the balcony
of the Railway Hotel watching the three
elephants milling in the street.
At 12.30 police, arjned with a service
rifle, attempted to manoeuvre the ele-
phant into a position where it could be
killed by one shot, without danger to
crowds watching from buildings on both
sides of the street.
The other elephants brought to
quieten the savage bull, hindered the
police, who hesitated to advance for
fear of provoking a fresh outbreak.
About 2 a.m. the elephant was enticed
back into its cage.
Drummett, the victim, had been with
Perry’s Circus for twenty years.

MAMMOTH KILLER
FORBES, Wednesday.
“FTIOM,” the savage bull ele-
X phant which attacked and
killed his keeper, Jack Stevens,
at Parkes last night, will be
poisoned.
He is securely shackled in a
truck at Forbes, awaiting the
lethal dose, which has been pre-
pared.
The animal is demented, and today his
keepers were frightened to go near him.
The carcase will be cremated.
At the inquest into Stevens’s death
today Eric Whinskill, business manager
of the circus, said that if Stevens was
drunk, or if it had been hit unneces-
sarily, the elephant might turn on him.
The elephant had been spiteful to other
people, he said.
Sergeant Stewart said a witness had in-
formed him that the elephant became
enraged when struck with a piece of iron
or gashed with the point.
The coroner returned a finding of ac-
cidental death.
Previous Attack
George Hill, a former employee of
Perry Bros, circus, was attacked by the
same elephant outside Ipswich (Qld.)
some months ago.
! “He used to pick up house bricks in
his trunk and hurl them at the crowd,”
said Hill yesterday.
“He hated drunks. He could smell
liquor fumes, and always became in-
furiated.”
Stevens was known professionally as
Jack Drummit.
I It has always been understood by most ,
.people that elephants are intelligent am- !
male, but it was quite surprising to see the
(wonderful knowledge of what was expeot-
ied by the keeper from the elephant be-
longing to Wirth’s circus displayed by
their beast yesterday afternoon on the ar-
| rival of this show from Melbourne by spe-
cial train. The unwieldy animal vyas
made to remove the cages oi wild beasts
off the trucks op to the platform ind did
so with remarkable sagacity and with ex-
treme care, never seeming to falter as to
| what should be done next. The .cages
l were then conveyed through the streets
‘to the location of the tents » Market

ceedings were watched with much in teres

ELEPHANT
AMUCK.
KILLS TRAINER.
Terror at Parkes.
DESPERATE CHASE IN
STREET.
Residents of Parkes took refuge
in their homes and other buildings
late last night when an elephant ran
amuck, killed its trainer, and
charged every person it saw in the
streets.
Circus attendants, with the assistance
of two tame elephants, shepherded the
elephant into a cage at 1.20 a.m.
The man killed was John Stevens,
46, who had been in charge of elephants
for 26 years. He was leading the ele-
| phant from a vacant allotment, where
a performance of Perry Bros’, circus
had been held, to the railway yards
when it attacked him.
Stevens’s screams were drowned by the
wild trumpetlngs of the elephant, which forced
him to the ground with its sawn-off tusks
and with its head. Stevens’s ribs, arms, leg?,
and skull were crushed. He died while the
Parkes Ambulance was rushing him to the
Parkes Hospital.
The streets were crowded with people who
had attended the circus performance and the
picture show, but no one was in the immedi-
ate vicinity of the Railway Hotel, in front
of which the attack occurred. Mr. and Mrs.
Griffin were in the hotel when they heard
the elephant trumpet. Immediately after-
wards there were screams. They ran down-
stairs and joined several young men and
Mrs. M. J. Kelly, proprietress of the hotel,
and her two daughters, Margaret and
Jacqueline. They risked their lives, as the
elephant had withdrawn only about 40 yards
from the spot where Stevens’s body was lying.
Calls were sent to the police and ambulance.
People approaching the hotel were chased
by the elephant, but everyone escaped. Some
of them ran into houses, while there were
nearly 300 people trapped in the hotel. Most
of them crowded on to the balcony and
watched late-comers running for their lives.
Constable Reddington was at the police
station when a circus attendant ran to him.
CONSTABLE’S ESCAPE.
“The man was out of breath and hardly
able to speak,’’ Constable Reddington said.
“Then he gasped, 'The elephant has got a
man. Have you a gun?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ and
we ran about a quarter of a mile to the Rail-
way Hotel. The elephant had approached
the railway yards. I climbed a fence and
saw him about six yards away. He was still
standing near the spot where he had attacked
Stevens. I clipibed back over the fence
and was joined by Constable Iverach. We
crossed the fence lower down. Then we
heard the elephant trumpeting. I looked round.
“He was only about 50 yards away, with his
trunk stretched towards us. As soon as he
saw us he rushed. Although he was so
big he seemed to run ten times as fast as
we could, as we ran to a motor lorry that
ha,, been left in the street. We reached it
just before him 'and dived into the driver’s
cabin.
“He did not look for us, but ran round the
, truck and began to attack the back. I tried
to start the engine, but it would not go. The
elephant shook the truck. Constable Ivc-ach
and myself decided to run for it. Luckily the
truck hid us when we started. When the
elephant saw us. it ran after us, but we
reached the hotel and slammed the door. The
elephant then rushed back to the truck and
dragged it about 50 yards, trying to smash it
to pieces.”
SCENE IN STREETS.
People continued to come down the streets
towards the hotel. They were forced to run
when the elephant chased them. One man
entered a door when the elephant was about
three feet behind him. Telephone calls were
made throughout the town in an attempt to
warn anyone who might approach the locality
Constable Reddington left the hotel and
climbed over back fences. He took a cir-
cuitous route, and entered the streets about
300 yards away from the hotel. He was able
to warn-several parties, and he left a guard.
Tommy Perry, a member of the circus party,
who was mounted on a horse and armed with
a stockwhip, and other circus attendants,
accompanied by two old female elephants,
persuaded the elephant to enter its barred
cage after long and anxious manoeuvring.
The men risked their lives, as the animal was
still excited and trumpeting continuously.
Sergeant Stewart gave orders that the
elephant was not to be shot while it was free,
because it was feared that if it became
wounded it would be maddened further. The
police obtained .303 rifles to shoot the animal.
The elephant, which had tusks about 2ft
long, had not given trouble previously. Stevens,
who was a native of New Jersey, U.S.A.,
appeared to have its confidence. Perry Bros!’’
circus had given a performance at Parkes last
night, and the elephont and other animals
were loaded on trucks at 2 o’clock this morn-
ing and taken to Forbes.

WF ■ LONDON, July 30,
Commenting on the death of Mr. Harold David-
son, former Rector of Stiffkey, from wounds received
after being mauled by a lion he was exhibiting at Skeg-
ness amusement park, the ‘‘Daily Mail” states that
his craving for publicity was unabated. Even when
dragged, bleeding and mauled, from the lions’ cage,
his first words were: “Telephone the London news-
papers. You mustn’t miss the first editions.” While in
hospital he asked for newspaper reports of the incident
to be read aloud, and among his last words were: “Am
I on the main pag*e?”
The Ex-Rector of Stiff key in the Lion's Cage
i The lion which mauled him remained
on exhibition after his death, but Mr.
Davidson’s daughter protested, saying it
was disgraceful, after which the show
was closed down and a long queue
turned away.
The manager said: “Mr. Davidson w
the bravest man I have ever known, b
was afraid of cows.”
The “Daily Mail” adds that Mr. Davk

5-Mile Chase
For Circus
Monkey
Alby, a performing Rhesus
monkey, attached to Wirth’s Circus,
had U hours of freedom overnight,
in which he climbed from house-
tops. hid under sleep outs, per-
formed on electric wires, and raced
over roads and across paddocks, over
five miles of the Box Hill district
before he was caught shortly after
10 a.m. today
Wirth’s gave a show at Box Hill last
night and Alby broke his lead when be-
ing taken to his cage at 11 p.m. In the
scuffle to capture him four other mon-
keys broke away, but these were recap-
tured.
The show moved off for Korumburra,
and a keeper was left to search foi Alby,
who is a star performer.
Early today he was found about 200
yards away from the circus site. His
keeper approached coaxingly, but the
monkey scampered.
Mr L. C. Barclay, of Station Street,
heard a noise on his roof, and found Alby
sitting there. The monkey then leapt
over fences to a yard some doors away.
As he landed in the fowl pen the hens
and roosters made a terrific commotion.
A pet cockatoo expressed its resentment,
and numerous dogs barked.
Children Enjoyed Chase
Children gathered in the streets and
as Alby raced along Alexander Street
into Bass Street he was followed by an
ever increasing crowd of voungsters or;
bicycles and scooters. Others ran. and
one pair followed in a billy cart.
Alby rested on the roof of the home
of Mrs E. Underwood, in Bass Street,
eating biscuits that some of the children
had thrown him, ar.d when his keeper
arrived he was on the lawn, eating grass
The keeper called out persuasively, but
Alby leapt to the roof again.
While two men were climbing to the
roof Alby jumped to the ground, and
raced to the shopping centre at the
corner of Station Street and Canterbury
Road.
Groups of women shoppers gave shrieks
of surprise as Alby dropped in among
them. When his keeper arrived he leapt
to the shop roofs, and, as the man
climbed after him, jumped down again,
and dashed up Canterbury Road.
The monkey then dashed over fences
and paddocks, and hid in long grass in
a drenching rain, until he was discovered
by a boy.
The keeper walked over to him, and
Alby jumped up into his arms.
ELEPHANT’S RAGE.

Evidence at Inquest,
ANIMAL DESTROYED WITi
POISON.
PARKES, Wednesday.
At the inquest to-day into the deat
of John Stevens, who was killed v/hei
a bull elephant ran amuck last nighl
Sergeant Stewart said that he had beei
told that the elephant had become en
raged when it had been struck or gashet
with the point of an iron goad.
It was also announced that it was intendec
to poison the elephant.
Sergeant Stewart said at the spot where
the elephant attacked Stevens, he found a
goad, a man’s hat, a pair of shoes, a tin oi
I tobacco, a comb, and a penny.
The Government medical officer (Dr. Hen-
derson) said that Stevens had suffered terrible
injuries. Four nbs and the right arm had
been broken, and the head injured. Death
was caused by a crushed chest.
Eric Hill, an employee of Perry Bros.’ Circus,
said that, about 10 o’clock last night he told
Stevens that the elephant, which was tethered
to a truck, had the door open and was pulling
articles out. Stevens untied the elephant, but
witness did not see him again.
Eric Whinskill, the business manager of the
circus, said that the elephant did not take
pari in any of the performances. Stevens had
sole charge of it. It was a bull elephant,
and spiteful to other persons. Whinskill said
that if Stevens was drunk and struck the
elephant unnecessarily It might turn on him.
It was intended to poison the elephant.
The District Coroner returned a verdict of
death by misadventure.
PUT TO DEATH.
FORBES, Thursday.
The bull elephant, Tommy, which killed its
attendant, John Stevens, at Parkes on Tues-
day night, was put to death at Forbes last
night in accordance with a promise made to
the Parkes police.
The animal was kept a close captive in
the railway truck all yesterday, and late last
night he was poisoned under police super-
vision.
In his death throes, Tommy drove his huge
tusks through the heavily reinforced side of
the railway truck. Great difficulty was ex-
perienced in removing the carcass from the
truck.
The death of the elephant represents a loss
of between £ 500 and £ 600 to Perry Bros.,
the proprietors of the circus.
' Two of the other elephants were brought to
Forbes by road because circus officials feared
that they would be attacked if placed in the
cage. . , ,
About 12 months ago Tommy gave trouble
in Adelaide, when it chased James Perry out
of the circus ring. ______

A TALK WITH MR. G. WIRTH.
Public entertainers who travel the
world are led strangely into the by-
paths of and the Messrs.
Wirth Bros., whose hippodrome, circus,
and menagerie open here on December
21 at the Theatre Royal, have had a
very fair share of the excitement of the
showman’s life. Their aggregation has
toured the Avorld, and in doing so have
occasionally got into some Avarm cor-
ners, interestjijg details of Avhicli were
gathe ed during a chat Avith Mr.
George Wirth. South Africa was their
first destination on leaving Australia,
and tl ey entertained President Kruger
at Pretoria. The Boers are fond of a
circus, but they are not prepared to
MR. GEOROE WIRTH. THE WELL KNOWN CIRCUS PROPRIETOR.
give file performers due credit, as they
implicitly believe that it is almost all
an optical delusion, the slioa\ t proprie-
taiy being invested with some myste-
rious power. Kruger thought the best
feat of the Avliole programme consisted
of a goat riding a horse. The Jameson
raid droA 7 e the circus to South America,
and splendid business avus done
amongst the Republics. At Monte
Video Wirth Bros, lost everything by
fire, except the horses, the Australian
and South African menageries being
destroyed. The principal of equality
is Avell carried out in these Republics.
The circus took over some Kaffirs from
South Africa for slioav purposes, but
the white man and the black man are
on the same platform in many parts of
South America. The Kaffir soon came
to understand this, and wouldn’t work'.
When the circus got to Paranar the
Chilians and Argentinos Avere quarrel-
ling, and a very lWely scene occurred in
the tent, one of the belligerents being,
Avith difficulty, prevented from having
a shot at the actor who Avas doing a
big jockey act. On another occasion
the Brazilians and some Englishmen
fought in the town where they Avere
showing, and the people connected
with the circus would possibly have
had a bad time had they not shoAvu
that they Avere Australians. The Bra-
zilians were not interested in colonial
affairs, so the circus passed along safe-
ly, after a good deal of threatening at
close quarters. Wherever things were
quiet, however, the circus Avas highly
popular. Mr. Wirth describes the au-
diences as enthusiastic. They hiss
when they approve, but whistle Avhen
they are tired of an act. or it does not
please, which is rather contrary to Aus-
tralian practices. While in South Ame-
rica the circus lost a number of men
from smallpox and yellow fever. One
very funny incident came under Wirth
Brothers’ notice before they left. There
are a number of small Irish colonies
amongst the Republics, and the owner
of a ranch, a typical Irishman, invited
them to see him and select a feAv
horses. They Avcnt out and Avere at-
tended by a number of red Indians,
who sat like sphinxes in their saddles,
immutable as the stone images tliem-
selves. One of the Wirths noticed a
fine grey horse in the mob and said.
‘‘We must have that one.” “Share. he'd
be no good to yez; lie’s as lame as tlm
divil.” came fro 7 one. of tl,ie Indians,
to the intense amusement of the Aus-
tralians. But the ox lanation was sim-
ple. The only English the Indians
picked up was Irish, for the colony was
all Irish when it was not Indian. The
circus had a very successful time in
England, and it was seen by Edward
VII., then Prince of Wales, at South-
port. France, Germany, and back to
South Africa, were the next moves.
The combination was at Matching and
Kimberley just before the war broke
out. and a week was spent at Pretoria.
While at the latter place an English
member of the circus ejected Eloff.
who has since come into prominence in f
the war for speaking disrespectful!''-'ape
the Queen. The circus reached ex cite-
Town to find it drunk with wa -de oyer
ment, and so Wirth Brothers ma d and

doAvn from Queensland they were put
to more trouble about their horses,
through official supervision, owing to
the tick plague, than In any other part
of the Avorld. Wirth Brothers have
shown a most enterprising spirit, and
have made great strides in their pro-
fession. They carry Avith them, in the
shape of medals, addresses, and other
presents, the good opinion of the people
from all OA-er the world.

Citizens Invited
Circus Memories
Many Daniels will come to judgment on
Caulfield Cup eve, October 16. They will
be in the lions’ den —or somewhere near
it.
Some of Victoria’s members of Parlia-
ment. some of Melbourne’s city council-
lors, and a number of leading citizens have
accepted the invitation of Mr. Philip
Wirth to take dinner with his lions on
Caulfield Cup eve. They will eat, not
with the lions, but in the presence of five
or six of them.
Mr. Wirth decided upon the dinner as a j
novel way to mark his completion of 50 ;
years of circus life. He issued 100 in- j
vitations. The tables will be set in the
shape of a horseshoe inside a large cage, i
which will fill the entire circus ring at ■
Wirth’s Park. At the open space in the!
horseshoe will be another cage containing
the lions, and during the dinner they will
be released to roam around the tables
under the supervision of their trainer.
The proceedings will be broadcast, and an
attempt will be made to relay the broad-
cast to England.
The Chief Secretary (Mr. Bailey) will
be chief guest, and those who have ac-
cepted invitations will include the leader
of the Labour party (Mr. Tunnecliffe), Mr.
Drew, M.L.A.; Mr. Barry, M.L.A.; Mr.
Hayes, M.L.A.: the chief officer of the

Where the ELEPHANTS
GO TODIES
By A.M. Mackenzie
The author is the only white man
who can throw any light on this pro-
found mystery —superstition curbs
the tongues of natives, if they know
anything.
Mr. Mackenzie is a noted "White
Hunter," and the tale he has to tell
is the result of chance.
THE elephant cemetery has long
been a bone of contention among
hunters. Most of them believe
that such a place does exist, but
there are others who laugh at this idea
and say that it only exists in the novel-
ists’ imagination.
Personally, I belong to those who be-
lieve in it, and I am sure that many of
these places are to be found. This jun-
gle mystery was one which never ceased
to intrigue me. I have hunted elephants
for a number of years in East Africa,
and never have I come across the car-
case of an elephant that has died from
old age or natural causes, except on one
memorable occasion. At other times
there has always been the bullet or the
arrow head to liow the animal met
its end.
When following a wounded bull I
found that he always headed in one
direction. For instance, in the Elgeyo
and Suk country, where I hunted for
some years, wounded animals went north.
Sometimes I came up with them and
was able to finish them off, and some-
times they got away altogether, but
always they headed north. They exer-
cised great skill and cunning in covering
their tracks, and often the spoor we have
been following has seemed to vanish
completely, and it has taken us hours to
pick it up again, and occasionally we have
never got on to it at all.
Only after being sure that he was not
being followed would the animal ease up
in his efforts to hide his tracks. It was
this habit of heading north that first
made me think that there was a place
somewhere that these animals made for
when they knew their days were num-
bered. I determined to look for it.
First I tried to imagine what such a
place would be like, and this was the
theory I evolved: It had to be a place
where the feeding was plentiful and
easily come by, and where there was an
abundance of water, for an elephant
must drink every 24 hours. Finally, it
had to be a place that hunters knew
nothing of. and where sanctuary was
certain. This theory seemed to me to
be quite a sound one, and I started to
look for such a place.
I spoke of my idea to the late Bill
Judd, who was, I think, the greatest of
all big game hunters, and he agreed
with me that there very probably were
a number of places of the kind I des-
cribed. He said that he was sure that
one existed in the Lorian swamp dis-
trict, and had himself tried to find it,
but without success. He thought that
if anyone ever found out they would be
led to it by the animals themselves, as
the chances of coming on one by acci-
dent were remote.
His advice to me, however, was not
to be too keen on following a wounded
bull for too long in the hope that I
would be led to the place, for he said
an elephant is the most dangerous ani-
mal in the world when he realises that
his number is up.
“You know as well as I do, Mac, that
a wounded elephant is not the thing to
take chances with at any time, and these
beasts when heading for their lost sanc-
tuary seem to be endowed with super-
natural cunning, so heed my advice and
take no risks.”
Bill was killed a few months after this
by a bull elephant in the Wakamba
country. Many times after this I took
trips into the Suk country, looking for
the cemetery which I was certain exist-
ed. Strangely enough, the natives could
give me no information at all about any
such place. They agreed that these

places did exist, but seemed in awe of
the spirits which they said lived there.
My efforts were at last rewarded, how-
ever, though my reward was not as great
as I had hopsd. I had shot at and
wounded a big bull near the foot of the
Elgeyo Escarpment. It was a bad shot
and had taken him too far back. He
was a big tusker, carrying over two hun-
dred pounds of ivory, and I had no in-
tention of letting him get away.
The chase was a long and arduous
one and led through some very rough
country along the foot of the Suk Es-
carpment and down towards the Turk-
well River. Twice we came up with
him, but I was unable to get in a shot.
On the second day he managed to lose
us.
One moment we were following a plain
spoor and we could not pick it up again.
We began to go round in ever-increas-
ing circles in an attempt to cut his
track again, and this we managed to do
about a mile farther on. I had begun
to hope by this time that this animal
would lead me to the place I had looked
for so long.
On the third day we were nearing
the Turkwell River at a place called
Marech. Big thorn trees and wild sisal
grew in thick profusion and our one
means of ingress or egress was along
the track we were following. The bush
and scrub round about was too thick
to penetrate.
I was on the alert all the time, for
we were close to the animal and expect-
ing to see him at any minute. At last
we came up to him and after a very
exciting few minutes during which I
nearly lost my life, I managed to kill
him. After he was down and I had
cooled off a bit, I noticed quite close
to where we were the skeleton of an-
other elephant.
It had been there for many years and
there was no ivory. The Suk natives
began to come in for meat, they seem
to be able to smell it, and I questioned
them about this place.
They then pointed out to me several
skeletons lying about. They said that
they had known of this place for years
and often came there to look for ivory.
I remained there for two days and dur-
ing that time my tracker and self found
nearly two hundred skeletons in an area
of, say, six square miles, but no ivory.
The natives had forestalled us. It was
just such a place as I had imagined,
with plenty of food and water, and I
suppose I was the first white hunter
that had ever been there.
The Suk natives told me some hair-
raising stories of fierce elephants that
had come there from time to time. Only
the very brave among them ever visited
the place and many of them had met
their death there.
Only the very old and very clever
animals came there, and these, they
solemnly informed me, lay in wait for
the unwary hunter, and having charged
home, they then kneaded their unfor-
tunate victim into pulp. My presence
there gave the natives a feeling of
safety. Normally the sooner they got
away from it the better they -were
pleased.
Here there was an elephant cemetery,
not a very big one, it is true, but proof
that such a place does exist. There
must be many more such places, and
these will, no doubt, be found in time.
In Abyssinia, for instance, there are said
to be two such places; the natives there .
firmly believe in their existence, and I
have hopes one day of finding them.
The search would be fraught with
danger, and the hunter’s chance at best
a fifty-fifty one, but the reward in ivory
if the locality had not been stripped
would be well worth the risk.
I have spoken to some old Masai Wan-
derobo, who live in the forests on Mount
Elgon, and they were quite sure that a
place where the big bulls go to die was
to be found in the Karamaja country.
They, like most natives, had the be-
lief that it was unlucky to go looking
for such a spot, and that it was pro-
tected by the spirits of the old bulls.
Often when a bull elephant is
wounded, another younger animal would
go with him to help him along. As
soon, however, as the stricken one
turned into the direction of thsir sanc-
tuary, the other one immediately left
him and returned to the hind. This is
quite true, and I have found it hap-
pen on many occasions. So it would
seem that only when he is sure that he
is to die will the animal turn to the
place that he knows instinctively will
afford him peace and comparative safe-
ty in which to spend his last hours.

OF CIRCUS LIFE
Defying Death on the High
Trapeze
TALES OF OLD TROUPERS—
BARNUM’S HEAD
ELEPHANT
(By GORDON W ILLIAMS)
THERE IS nothing in all the world of entertainment which
catches our imagination so effectively or compellingly as the circus
that glittering and garish parade of riders, clowns, elephants and
acrobats, of naphtha flares and menagerie noises that create a world
apart out of a mass of canvas and a tangle of ropes and poles.
Most of us hold cherished memories of circus visits in out child-
hood, and. if we be frank, most of us will admit that the lure of the Big Ring
still has power to take us in thrall. At the moment, there are in Perth depic=
tions of two circuses—that of the Roman era, with its grimness and tragedy,
and that of today, with its pomp, panoply and showmanship, let there is much
of the same spirit in both, of adventure and enterprise, as stones 1 elated in
the following article will show.
E HAVE it on the word of no less
tj-jC A 7 ,r ' an authority than Mr. Bertram
yy A m/p /*/ Mills that the circus artist’s pro-
f/ffl Wj mi j* fession is the most exciting and ad- •
venturous in the world —and it is
vCf l ,r °bably because of these very at-
Oz §£& tributes that so few performers
Hr m a m JjugL ever abandon their profession. They
.Ware caught in it as surely as though
the ringmaster, that tremendous
person who emerges from our
youth as some deified entity
around whom all the color, the glow, the cavalcade,
and the romance that is a circus, perennially re-
volves. had cracked his whip and sprung a trap
which will hold them close until they take their last
call. At any rate, they will be willing prisoners.
Go down among them now, where the Big Top
throws out its romantic challenge upon the custom-
arily calm and unemotional bank of the Swan, and
you will find almost that you move among a strange
people—certainly you will move among artists who
have no counterpart in the whole, vast world of en-
tertainment. They are wanderers; here today—to-
morrow they will, perhaps, be on their way to New
Zealand; they are elusive as they are mercurial —
and as shy as they are elusive. You can never get
to know circus folk by a merely superficial acquaint-
ance with them. You must live with them ; absorb
their psychology, realise the tremendous nature of
the bond that binds them together, rejoice in their
joys, and share in their sorrows before you can get
to know them at all well.
'Phis tendency to live so much within themselves
is in the main quite understandable. They are of
a world apart, in the first place; they move in a
unique circle, but perhaps, above all, their isolation
is largely atavistic. Perhaps they could hardly ex-
plain their shyness themselves, but there are factors
which seem to suggest its possible source. In the old
day of circuses the performers and the population of
the big tent had a language of their own. even. This
was, we are told, evolved as a necessary protection
for. by reason of their nomadic life, they were
looked on as little better than rogues and vagabonds,
and, as such, open to the attacks of the unthinking
and the loutish. They felt the need of close
friendship and a language which should not be un-
derstandable to outsiders as potential defences in
lime of attack. This language became known the
world over among the fraternity, aud persists, even
today, in America.
There are probably other places where this Gipsy
tongue of the circus may be heard, too, but _ its
.sharpest survival is undoubtedly in the United
States,’ where the cry “Hey! Rube” (which, by the
way, has been immortalised in a film of that name)
is sufficient to send every man of the whole circus
outfit scurrying for a weapon, for the import of
that strange yell is that au attack is being made
upon the circus folk.
The Two Circuses
At the moment in Perth we may see two types of
circus—the Circus of the Old Romans (which forms
•so big a part of the ificture, “The Sign of the
Cross”), and the modern circus, which had its
origin largely in the Amphitheatre of Philip Astley,
founded towards the end of the 18th century in the
Westmiuster-road, London. The Roman Circus and
its modern namesake were vastly differing organisa-
tions. The former was largely given up to its
chariot races and gladiatorial encounters; the latter
provides us with lighter entertainment, but beneath
it is the, same current of serious endeavor and hazard
which under-ran the terrible “acts” of Nero’s day.
But before passing on to the circus performer aud
his task, it would be well to discover to whom we
owe the modern tradition of the circus—for here we
will find that, even in its beginning, the “Big Top”
and its glamorous tradition were rich in romance.
Philip Astley, the founder of all circuses as we know
them, was originally a cavalry man, who rose to the
rank of sergeant while serving in his regiment, His
horsemanship was of a superb order, and, discover-
ing that his feats were the envy, admiration and
despair of his comrades, he decided that when he loft
the army he would commercialise them. In the
first place, whether because of pure coincidence or
whether because our military equestrian had a con-
tinual eye to the main chance, he married a trick-
rider’s daughter, and together they gave exhibitions
of clever horsemanship in an open field. The half-
pennies which the public threw into the couple, to-
gether with fees which they received for riding
lessens, enabled Astley to set about the construction
of a rough-and-ready circus building—“soon aiter-
wards, business being so good—there was no enter-
tainment tax or movie palace competition—he con-
structed an amphitheratre which became famous.”
The great travelling circuses of recent times —
Bertram Mills's, Ragenbenck’s, Sarrasini’s, and
better known still to Australians, Wirth’s —would
make Astley’s o.ves open with sheer wonder, admira-
tion and envy. The biggest of the Continental shows
25 or o 0 elephants (each of which, we are
told, costs, at a, conservative estimate, £400), each
boasts a contingent of often 500 human beings and
400 animals, packed away with tents, seating ac-
commodation, elaborate lighting apparatus, and
“props” in a hundred or more lorries.
A Kaleidoscope World
And this is the sort of world any one of these
shows might house —the sort of world Dr. A. H.
Kober, an extremely erudite German professor, de-
scribes in his fascinating book, “Star Turns": —-
“In a couple of glances one sees a dozen ro-
mances and material for several novels. _ There
is the haute ecole rider, whose wife, iu the
caravan, is a countess; farther along the
juggler, who won and lost a fortuue in Monte
Carlo, is practising. On the trapeze stands the
acrobat who changed his name for £lO,OOO
when liis sister was going to marry a lord.
There is a clown who has studied theology; a
lady acrobat on the shoulders of her fifth hus-
band. who shot the fourth at Constantinople; a
dancing girl who had an affair with a minister
which put all Paris agog; a jockey who fought
as a volunteer in six wars; a stable groom
who is the sou of a high Czechoslovak official;
a drink-sodden bill-sticker who once called a
circus with a hundred horses his own. They
all work together—they belong together. This
immense tent, where no one would risk opening
an umbrella for fear of bad luck, is their uni-
verse.”
'ls it any wonder there is a particular glamor
overhanging all the cities of the Big Top, with their
ever-changing kaleidoscopic populations? Dr.
Kober’s word picture is painted around a European
aggregation, of course, but that does not for a mo-
ment argue that a similar condition might not ob-
tain in any circus—yes, even in those with which we
are familiar.
Persons of the Drama
When one thinks of circuses, there inevitably come
to the mind those grotesquely garbed, grotesquely .
painted figures of clowns, and those whirling, shoot-
ing figures, known as aerial acrobats, who dttv
death in a thousand astonishing ways at each per-
formance. These two, in some fashion, are the higfi-.
lights of the modern circus—but they held not
always this high office in the world of the cncus.
In ancient Bgypt, and Greece, and Babylon, Ml,
Leonard Crocombe points out, clowns were un-
known. They probably originated in the need to
relieve the audiences in the theatres ot ancient
Greece aud Rome after the strain of blood-curdling
tragedies—in fact, they probably came as comic
relief, 5 * now universally recognised as an essential
of all well-produced drama.
And how we love clowns! Whether we are
capable or not of seeing ourselves “as the comic
fools and knaves of life,” we are well aware that
there is something essentially human m that weird
figure whose antics set us all smiling; yet today
will be reluctantly forced to the conclusion that
the great travelling shows have lost much ot tne
glamor with which Leoncavallo invested them in i
Pagliacci.”
There are few hazards your clown won’t undertake
in his quest of a laugh—and in this regard one
can do no better than quote some of the incidents
which the inimitable Grock (who, unfortunately,
we in Western Australia have seen only in the cel-
luloid mockery of the film) relates in his biography.
This is his uoble idea of fun: —
It is a burlesque bullfight, but a burlesque that
is filled with danger. Grock has infuriated the bull
* by seizing its tail —whereat the audience laughed—
and is now being hotly pursued:
“But before the hull had managed to impale
me from behind, I had swung myself over the
estrade aud was making a long nose at it.
The seat of mv
trousers had suf-
fered considerably,
none the less; those
develish horns had
torn a mighty rent
across them, and
torn much more
than that, too. T
could feel the blood
beginning to ooze
through the wound.
But once a| hr 1
leapt into the arena,
dancing around like
a cat on hot bricks,
both hands on m.v
injured part —and
the audience simply
adored me for it.”
One wonders what
would have happened
had our fun-makers been
a little less active, or
had the bull been a little
more he-adlong. But for
Crock, the typical circus
clown, it all meant just
another laugh “the
audience adored me for
it,” he says; and how
often do we of the audi-
ence fail to see the tra-
gedy that lurks below
the ripples of laughter,
ready to spring out and
engulf both the laugh-
maker aud the laugh-
in0 * ?
And here is the human
touch which lies almost
inevitably below the
motley of the clown, hid-
den and masked by the

paint and the patches of the traditional costume
of the circus jester .
“As for the Grock who is not Grock —the off-
stage Grock —he smokes 40 cigarettes a day. drinks
his glass of beer, wears patent underclothes, aud
wants nothing so much as a little peace and quiet-
ness. Such a very little peace and quiet. He would
like to be left to hoe his patch of potatoes, sow his
spinach, and plant his cherries . . . He is as homely
as were his beginnings ...”
Yet it is invariably true that when the “peace
and quiet” ideal is attainable, the artist cannot
resist the call of the ring, and continues with its
hazards and its daily tasks long after the need for
such exertion exists. In this regard, Bertram Mills
quotes the case of Catalini, the “hurricane rider,’
who made a fortune as a circus proprietor, and re-
tired. He came back. He could not resist the lure
of the sawdust track or the shine and sparkle of
the spangles. He had been inoculated with the
nomadic virus, and his destiny was indissolubly
bound up with the destiny of the Big Top—and
Catalini, once and for all, has discovered that the
only real and worth-while method of enjoying life
is to risk it twice daily! And there is no doubt
that circus life offers as many risks as active ser-
vice. . . , Mr Mills tells us, and none should know
better, that nearly every circus performer has had
a serious accident in his or her life, and yet they
go on performing. As soon as they recover they get
back to their jobs, “for the love of their profes-
sin”; yet every time an artist climbs up to the
trapeze, or enters a wild animal’s cage, death is
peeping over his shoulder. Yet what is the trapeze
artist’s philosophy?
Listen to Alfredo Codona, a member of one of the
most famous aerial acrobatic teams iu the world :
“There is a trick in taking a fall. . . . An in-
surance salesman once told me that a majority ot
his settlements for injuries came about as the result
of simple falls —a tumble downstairs, off a chan,
over a rug, or from a step-ladder. The average
step-ladder is about seven feet high—it breaks many
legs and arms each year. Yet, if the person who
tumbles off a step-ladder to a result of broken bones
only knew now to fall, it would be possible to climb
to the top of a forty-foot ladder and allow that ladder

then, with a quick twist, he jerks his head undei-
neath him, lands on his shoulders, and bounces up-
ward in a forward somersault. So there we lam
ridden by his urge lor a good act, diivm„ his
trapeze higher and higher until the limit ot its
swing is reached. Suddenly he shoots over the bar,
and commences his downward plunge in the dive to
the net. ... '
“Two feet above the net J jerked inward for tin 1
forward somersaulting position, struck the net and
wont straight through ! I was at the most, eight
feet from the ground, and in a position which meant
my death. In that eight feet I jerked out of the
forward somersault into a backward one. lit on my
feet, instantly turning another and a third and a
fourth, swung into a succession of roll-overs, and
came to my feet for my bow absolutely uninjured .
Taking for granted the possibility that the
slight resistance of the net broke my fall to a speed
of only 112 feet a second. I nevertheless had been
fortunate to pull myself out of a fatal position into
one of salvation in a quarter of the time necessary
to the tick of a watch.”
Fortunate is a mild expression under the circum-
stances. Yet that experience is by no means unique
-—there is, without doubt, no aerial acrobat in the
whole world of sawdust and spangles who could not
relate an almost similar adventure. Yet they have
learned how to fall, and the measure of their acquiie-
rnent. of this knowledge is the measure of their
ability to stall off death. ... If ever a clan lived
■ dangerously, it is these people of the high trapeze,
and the walkers of the high wire. Tot they could
no more keep away from the practice of theii
hazardous professions than a sailor can keep away
from the sea. And the risks of their callings are real
and actual.
Frequently oue will visit the picture theatre and
witness daring feats performed by the “stars, but
in many cases one is supported by the comforting
knowledge that it is probable a good deal of the
feat is faked. There is no mimicry of reality about
to fall with him to the
ground, without injury.
I .have fallen like a
plummet —not once, but
a score of times- —thirty,
even forty, feet straight
to the ground with no
more serious injury than
a few bad bruises.'' And
Mr. Codomi adds: —
“Please understand that
I do not mean to con-
vey the impression that
the falls of a circus per-
former are childish mat-
ters, or that they are
not dreaded. There is
time after time when, in
spite of everything one
can do, the ambulance
is summoned, when a
performer is carried out
of the big top. Tint there
are times when the am-
bulance might have been
called, hut isn’t owing
to the fact that a Her-
culean spasm of fumb-
ling tricks has saved a
life.’’
Let us look in at one
of the sessions where
such a “Herculean
spasm” .has cheated
death-—let us look the
better to appreciate how
these flying acrobats

OTHER CLEVER GIRLS
Two other young English girls, Miss
Mary Sykes and Miss Mary Dee, speci-
ally Vained for High School or trick
riding, were practising. “For a long time
trick riding in circuses has been con-
fined mainly to a few families,” an offi-
cial told a Daily Mail reporter. “Mr Mills
has decided that it would be an excellent
thing if the art could be revived in Eng-
land.”
Both Miss Dee and Miss Sykes have
hunted regularly since childhood, andj
between them have won many prizes for
; riding at horse shows.
Half the acts are making their first ap-
pearance in England. These include the J
Eight. Danwills, Baring’s comedy zebra,
Knie’s tigers, and the Four Albanos.

ELEPHANT SHOT.
PUBLIC SAFETY MENACED ?
RAJAH TO GO TO MUSEUM.
Rajah, one of the two elephants at the
Zoo, was shot this morning by order of
City Council officials, as it was believed
that he was a menace to public safety.
For some time past Rajah was regarded
as too bad-tempered to be allowed out
of the elephant house and in recent ‘
weeks he definitely “ turned rogue,” I
cnly his keeper being able to manage I
him. I
The great beast was bought for ‘
about £lOO from the Hobart zoo-
logical authorities about four years
ago, but his execution will not be a
total loss to the city, because the skin \
is to be turned over to the taxidermist j
and Rajah will be mounted and set up j

Jamuna, Rajah’s mate, has long been
required to do most of the work at the
Zoo. A docile beast, she has been ridden
by thousands of Auckland children and
little visitors, as her more surly-dispo-
sitioned companion was not entrusted
with the carriage of juveniles.
City Council officials are most reticent
regarding the execution, and nothing has I
i een reported concerning the manner of
Rajah’s death, but it is understood that
erasures were taken to ensure that his
ispatch was as quick and humane as

THE ELEPHANT
GOT A SHOCK
How two of Wirth’s Brothers'
pigmy elephants came to the aid of
one of their bigger sisters, when f
she suffered an electrical shock in
Kalgoorlie recently, was related to-
day by Mr. H. Mannington, ad-
vance manager for the circus.
The circus had established itself at
the Royal Hotel ground, Kalgoorlie,
and Mollie, the second biggest ele-
phant of the circus, weighing approxi-
mately three and a half tons, play-
fully put her trunk around an electric
light pole, on which a wire ran down
to a switch.
A short circuit occurred and with a
shrill scream Mollie was thrown to
the ground by the shock.
The two pigmy elephants, which had
! witnessed a similar experience in Wel-
lington last year, when Alice, the big-
! gest elephant, was rendered prostrate j
; for many hours, rushed to the side of;
the stricken elephont, and Alice, who'
was dragging a rake of waggons, also
hurried to her help.
It was only by the calmness of the.
transport manager, Mr. West, that what
might have been an awkward predica-
ment was avoided. As it was, Mollie
remained prostrate for nearly half an
hour.
• Mr. Mannington said that Wirth Bro-
thers had recently absorbed Ivan Bro-
thers’ International Circus, which
Major W. Condor (late of the Aus-
tralian Broadcasting Commission) had
brought from America at a cost of ap-
proximately £20,000. The acts of this
show have been incorporated into the
presentations which Perth will see on
August 11, and for the season of nine
nights and three matinees.
The circus, which will be located on
the Esplanade at the rear of Chris-
tian Brothers’ College, will be under
the sole direction of Mr. Philip Wirth,

LIONS’ cage banquet
By “ONE OF THEM.”
DAMOCLES, sitting at the banquet of Dionysius with a
naked sword suspended above his head by a single hair,
did not have such a bad time, after all. That, at least,
was the opinion of the 90 odd Melbourne citizens who acceptec
7he hospitality'of Philip Wirth, and dined in the lion s cage.
TT was a distinguished party and
1 one of the nicest functions ever
to be staged in Melbourne.
But the courageous citizens were
well rewarded. They partook of a
banquet which would not have
shamed Dionysius himself. They
had good company, and they heard
witty speeches. They had the plea-
sure of honouring Philip Wirth
senior, on the 60th anniversary of
his office as governing director of
Wirth’s Circus. They had the dis-
tinction of having assisted at a
gathering the like of which had
never been held before. And, not
least, after more than 200 0 years
they had the “lowdown” on Da-
mocles.
It was noticeable that the first
guests entered the huge cage with
some trepidation, and they only
after the originator of the function,
John D. Porter, led the way and
ushered the guests to their seats.
Soon, though, all the seats were
filled—those next to the lions last
of all. Then dinner was served with
much pomp.
That was when the Damocles
myth was exposed. The Hons took
no more than polite notice of the
fact that the diners were there and
eating. The guests were relieved.
Damocles must have experienced
the same feeling of relief when he
began his soup, and observed that
thi hair held. Out of considera-
tion for the lions, it appears, rather
than for the diners, they were in-
vited to re-enter their smaller cage
before the meat course was brought
in and a large elephant sedately
hauled them out into the mysterious
background of the circus, annd ap-
plause. Our host and hostess re-
mained on their dais for nearly one
hour before they retired. During
the whole time they never looked
at each other, and they never ex-
changed a word. However; when
the door closed on them I will say
that the gentle hum of conversation
in the cage rose about 10 octaves
and the sigh of relief that accom-
panied the applause nearly took the
roof off. From that moment the
attention and interest that the
guests had devoted to their glasses
was diverted to conversation and to
the good that deserved it. There
were only two doors at opposite
sides of the cage —2ft. door at that
—and there were 90 odd men inside

The man behind this memorable
function happened to be John D.
Porter, who was responsible for the
organisation, which embraced a
Commonwealth-wide hook-up over
the radio by the Australian Broad-
casting Commission; a Victorian
broadcast by 3AW, with Fred Tup-
pen at the mike; 500 feet of him
shot by Cinesound Films, London
and American daily newspapers re- :
presented by special men, and the j
visit of Interstate writers, who were
able to transmit their stories direct I
from Wirth’s Park. Columns ot
newspaper space before and aftei
the banquet were obtained by
John D., who exploited every angle
of publicity. Since the function a
meeting of those who attended the
banquet was held and a permanent
organisation formed. The idea is
to meet once a year in Melbourne,
when a novel menu will *>e pre-
sented. At the same meeting Philip
Wirth was presented by the Masonic
Grand Secretary (Mr. William
Stewart) with a donor’s jewel and
Life Governor’s jewel of the new
Masonic Hospital being erected in
Melbourne.

DINED WITH LIONS.
PROMINENT GUESTS SEND
DEPUTIES.
MELBOURNE, Friday.
Eighty-seven Melbourne citizens dined in a
den of lions to-night at Wirth Bros.’ circus,
to celebrated the 60th anniversary of Mr.
Philip Wirth as governing director of the
circus.
Mr. Wirth, who had conceived the idea of
the dinner among the lions, was, however,
unable to be present, owing to illness. The
party was marked by the number of persons
of high office who accepted the invitation, but
decided to be represented rather than to dine
with the live lions.
The lions took no more than polite notice
of the guests who, accordingly, were relieved.
The Minister for Customs (Mr. White), re-
] esenting the Prime Minister (Mr. Iwons),
proposed the toast of the health of Mr. Philip
Wirth, and the company joined with him in
expressing sympathy with him in his illness,
and hoping for his speedy recovery.
! “I gather that the honour of proposing this
toast has fallen upon me, because I am a
! member of the Lyons’ Ministry,” Mr. White
said, amid laughter. “It is a pleasure for
me to be in the lions’ den. It is a refuge to
me as Minister for Customs.” (Laughter.)
Each guest took away with him a bronze
medal, inscribed with his name, to commemo-
rate t-hfc. occasion.
ELEPHANTS PROVIDE NOVEL
GUARD OF HONOR FOR GOVERNOR
IjOORT, Thursday. Nine elephants from Wirth's Circus, with trunks
J raised in salute, provided a second and unusual guard of honor for the
Governor (Lord Huntingfield) and Lady Huntingfield when they arrived here
today. The first guard of honor was formed on the station by school
children and boy scouts, to whom Lord Huntingfield spoke.
r FHE Governor and Lady Huntingfield
were met by tho president, of Gor-
don Shire (Cr. C. Marfleet) and Miss
Marfleet presented Lady Huntingfield
with a bouquet. An address of wel-
come was presented to the Governor
by the shire engineer and secretary
(Mr. C. D. Graham). Tire school cap-
tain (Gladys Forster) also presented
■Lady Huntingfield with a bouquet of
wildflowers on behalf of the school
children and the Mothers’ Club.
The Governor asked that a special
holiday be granted to the children.
Lord Huntingfield alighted from his
car and with the manager of the circus
(Mr. Christie) inspected the elephants.
He then drove to the Sheep Show,
where he was the guest of the Agri-
cultural and Pastoral Society. |
Lady Huntingfield was officially wel-j
corned at the Fire Brigade Hall by Mrs.|
H. Coutes, group president of Boort
C.W.A., and was presented with flowers
by the secretary (Mrs. F. Leech). Lady
Huntingfield was entertained at after-
noon tea by the members of the C.W.A.
Auxiliary and the Mothers’ Club and
afterwards inspected the Bush Nursing
Hospital.

held at 5 p.m. to-day.
Circus employees attribute the ele-:

working “coolies,” was chained up all;
yesterday afternoon at the railway i
yards. Later it somehow got loose.

Brief Life Sketch of the Men
who made the name of
Wirth Bros. Famous
The life stories of the Wirth Bros., the men
who made the great Wirth’s Circus possible,
read like a romance. During a third of a
oentui’y this marvellous amusement enterprise'
has been the. wonder and delight of millions,
not only in this, their native country, but in
almost all parts of the world. To-day it is
more than ever one of the standard circuses
of the world, and its supremacy will un-
doubtedly continue for many years to come.
There are few persons indeed in Australia who
have not visited Wirth’s Circus at one time or
another, an dthere are, perhaps, fewer still
who do not feel that they owe them a certain
debt of gratitude for brightening their lives
or the lives of their children.
Originally there wei'e four Wirth brothers —
John. Harry, Philip, and George all Aus-
tralian born —John, the eldest, being born in
Ipswich, Queensland, which was at the time
of his birth N.S.W.; Philip, Beechworth, Vic-
toria; and George, the youngest, Sydney,
N.S.W. The two eldest, John and Harry, have
passed away—John dying in Alliwal North,
South Africa, in 1894, and Harry in Hong
Kong, in 1895. The two younger brothers,
Philip and George, are still personally con-
ducting Wirth’s world-famous show. World-
famous their names have become for they have
not only toured the world with their Australian
Circus, leaving behind them everywhere a
name a credit to Australia and Australians,
but nearlv every year one or other of the
brothers take a trip round the world in search
of novelties, spending heaps of money adver-
tising their wants in most of the leading pro-
fessional papers throughout the world; and
such is the treatment they serve to the artists
they engage, that now they are simply in-
undated with letters of appeal applying for a
season under their management in Sunny
Australasia. Therefore, is it any wonder that
they are able to present to the Australasian
public such artists of sterling merit and won-
drous achievements as they do from year to
year, for they have the pick of the world’s
greatest talent.
The four brothers started their circus in
Paddy’s Market, Sydney, in 1880. They were
all expert musicians as well as artists of ex-
ceptional merit, although the eldest was not
more than twenty-two years of age, while the
younger was bur thirteen. Talent was not
their only asset —chey had keen business in-
stincts, and when once they were fairly
launched on their own, they took no time in
gaining the top of the tree in their profession.
And many a hard fight they had in their early
days with concerns much bigger and longer
established than they, but they generally came
out on top, until their professional foemen
recognised in them hard nuts to crack, and gave
them a wide berth. Each year saw the Wirth’s
Circus bigger and better than the previous
one, until they were the complete masters of
circusdom in Australia.
In 1890 one of the brothers went to America
to organise a Wild West show for Australia.
The show arrived in September of that year,
and was a fac-simile of the Great Barnum &
Bailey’s Shows, putting under one huge canvas
a three-ring circus. Roman hippodrome races
and Wild West show combined. This was the
largest circus that ever toured Australia up
to that date, notwithstanding Cooper & Bailey’s
and Charini’s great circuses. It took three
special trains to convey it from town to town,
and consisted of over 200 people and 100 horses.
Even with this show they had opposition, as
Dr. Carver had also brought out an American
Wild West show, but once again the Australian
boys more than held their own.
In 1893, the banks failing and closing their
doors, made the country in such a state
financially that the brothers decided to take
a purely Australian circus and menagerie to
England. They embarked on board the
“Damascus” in October of that year with the
first and only Australian circus and menagerie
thar ever toured the world, and opened in Cape
Town in their new Opera House; from there
to Johannesburg, clearing an enormous amount
of money in thirteen weeks, after which they
toured the whole of Africa and Mauritius to
excellent business, making many friends and
leaving a good name everywhere they went,
but had the misfortune to lose their eldest
brother, whose grave is by the Orange River,
marked by a beautiful monument—a broken
marble column (a similar column covers the
grave of the late Mr. Harry Wirth, in Happy
Valley, Hong Kong). Many exciting experi-
ences occurred during their two years’ tour
through Africa which would fill a book four
times the size of this souvenir, but suffice it
to say that the Jamieson Raid put a stop to
their travels there. They chartered the S.S.
“Umona” and went to Montivideo, South
Africa. Here also many exciting events
occurred; they were caught in a revolution, and
in one town, Santa Fe, their whole show
horses and people were commandeered, and
were about to be sent to the borders of the
Argentine and Chili to fight the Chilians, but
were got out of the difficulty by the British
Consul. In Montivideo, in 1896, where they
were playing in a large theatre (the Novo
Polythama) they had the misfortune to be
burnt out, losing- all their tents, wardrobe,
gear, and menagerie, the only things saved
were their horses, which were luckily stabled
away from the theatre. After a thrilling-
twelve months in this country, where smallpox,
black and yellow fever raged, they at last
embarked on board the mail steamer “Ligura,”
at Pernambuco, in Brazil, for England, arriving
in Liverpool in December, 1896. They opened
in a circus building in Birkenhead, and made
such a success that they played there eight
weeks, all the time making a name for them- _
selves and Australia, their native country,H
which place most of their patrons were®
ignorant of, as many a curious question wasH
asked in regard to Australia. In Southport®

played there eighteen months, being visited and H

time he was touring with a Vaude-
ville Co. when the car skidded on a
steep mountain, overturned and fell
over an embankment 35 feet below.
This meant hospital treatment for a
few fractured bones. On another
occasion he was performing the
Monti Christo dive in Wellington
(N.Z.) where he was tied with ropes
then sewn up in a weighted sack and
thrown from the Queen’s Wharf.
As soon as he touched bottom a
small octopus seized hold of the bag.
Needless to say Raymond made re-
cord time in escaping and coming to
the surface. Another thrilling and
rather amusing experience happened
a few months ago in Kempsey
(North Coast district). At that
time he was showing with “Joy-
land” Raymond had arranged to do
a manacle dive off the passenger
bridge (which is a height of 61
feet.) This was to be done in aid
of the Kempsey Hospital. Now the
management of “Joyland” were only
advertising in one local daily paper.
When the Hospital authorities took
up the matter of advertising the
dive they advertised in both news-
papers. The one which "Joyland”
never advertised in, for some reason
or other, placed the advert, right
amongst the Funeral notices. Ray-
mond naturally thought this was
going to “Jonah” the act. Sure
enough a few moments before he
dived the plank which he was stand-
ing on broke and it was just by a
stroke of luck he managed to save
himself from a nasty fall. After he
performed the dive he was told that
he just missed the waiting boat by
about three inches. On another oc-
casion whilst touring with Messrs.
Wirth Bros. Circus he was doing
a manacled dive in Nelson from the
stern of the “s.s. Patena.” When on
coming to the surface the cry of
“shark” was heard he lost no time
in climbing the rope ladder, on

today who will regret to hear of the death of
Mr J. W. Cooke
Mr John Welby
Cooke, the familiar
ring - mastev of
Wirth’s Circus.
Born in America,
he lived his life in
that stirring atmo-
sphere of the big
tents, flying tra-
pezes and perform-
ing animals that
every Voungster
loves; and for 35
years he was With
"Wirth’s well-known
organisation. In his
younger days he
was a noted circus rider, but he is best
known to Melbourne as the distinguished
master with the long whip, round whom the
world of the circus revolyes.
A year ago, I recall that Mr Cooke was
attacked by the circus elephant, Cardie, in
Brisbane. The animal had eventually to be
shot, and Mr Cooke never quite recovered
from the shock of the incident. The ring
will be the poorer for his death.

, ing of accidental death by drowning,
at Edith vale last Sunday, of No rah

The rarty included Gus Franks, the
licensee of the Tam o’ Shanter Hotel,
and his family, and Roy Franks,
brother of the licensee. They motored
i to Edith vale. late, on Sunday afternoon
and went into the sea for a swim. Miss’
■ Gleason was apparently in the best of
health, and was a very good swimmer,
having competed in women’s cham-
pionships. She was seen swimming and
shewed no signs of exhaustion, and
was not seen to collapse. Later she
was missed. Her body was found by
Roy Franks, about 200 yards from the*
spot where she was last seen swim- 1

TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS.
' paragraph of to-day regarding
| the writ issued by "Prince’" Bignoli against
i Wirth Bros, may be misleading to the
public in the form in which it is set out. •
I The facts are that "Prince” Bignoli was
j engaged by Mr. Philip Wirth when in
i America under an agreement in writing,
which provided that Wirth Bros, were to i
retain out of "Prince” Bignoli’s salary
certain sums until £lOO was in hand, as a j
guarantee that "Prince” Bignoli would
perform his contract, the contract also
providing that on the expiration of the
! first year Wirth Bros, should be entitled
j to a renewal by “Prince” Bignoli as a,
I performer for a further year. Notice was v
1 given by our clients requiring the renewal,
1 but ‘ Prince"' Bignoli desired not to renew,
j! The sum which “Prince” Bignoli is claim-
; ing is the amount of the guarantee which
! our clients are entitled to hold pursuant
|to the agreement. Wirth Bros.’ per-
| formers and employees are all paid weekly, 1
and at no time in their very long and
successful circus can it be suggested that
they refused to promptly pay any per-
former or employee his .salary. We might
mention that under the agreement Our
clients have a counter-claim against
i “Prince” Bignoli.—Yours. &c.,
W. B. and McCUTCHEOX.

T HE death of John Welby Cooke,:
the well-known trainer and
equestrian director of Wirth’s Cir-
cus, is reported from Melbourne. Mr.
Cooke in his younger days was a
finished rider in the ring, and his
exposition of the bounding jockey act
was the last word in circus horse-
manship. , r j
Expression of Sympathy.
Circus Elephant Escapes.
IX a raging storm, in which :t big
circus tent was almost blown down,
and the animals were driven frantic
with fear by vivid flashes of lightning
and crashes of thunder, n bull elephant
from Perry Bros.' circus, in the
Domain (Hobart) broke loose last week.
The elephant charged down towards
the city, and oandemoninm reigned for
some time. The infuriated animal was
chased by several keepers, and as the
news of its escape spread pedestrians
and motorists, numbering some hun-
dreds. joined in the pursuit. But in r
the driving rain, with only the light- •
ning relieving the inky blackness, the
elenha nt got a good start.
The elephant is still at large, and
fears are entertained that he may do
damage, besides terrifying the people.
The death of Gus St. Leon, which oc-
curred at Junee (XkS.W".) last week,
removed one of the best-known figures
in the Australian circus field He was
the father of a clever family, all of
whom have made their mark under the
canvas top.
—October 17th, at Junee
N.S.W.), Augustus St. Leon, aged 74.
Deceased, who had been in circus
business virtually all his life, was
the father of the St. Leon troupe,
members of which are now playing
Australian vaudeville. For some
years deceased was associated with
Wirth's Circus.
ITOY BARTON, Mrs. Barton and the
Ashton family take this opportun-
ity of expressing their heartfelt sym
pathy to the St. Leon family in their
recent sad bereavement—the death of a
much beloved and highly respected
lather, who, with his family, was a
valued member of the Australian circus
world.
Circus Performer’s Loss
Miss Rita Betts, one of the per-
formers of Wirth' s Circus, Vv r as rob-
bed at the Hippodrome on Saturday
of a bag containing a string of pearls
and other articles, valued at £3O.
FELL 60 FEET
Much Better Now
Though still suffering pain from
head and abdominal injuries received
when he crashed 60 feet from a trapeze
at Wirth’s Circus on Saturday, Julius
Garcia is on the improved list at the
Homoeopathic Hospital to-day.
As assistant to Paul de Boult, whr
loops the loop on a trapeze, Garci?
was high above the ground when tin
swing threw him. .
baHc" mjvelty. <leVi 1,0 dat6S "’ ith an
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Groves, who, for
many years, had the refreshment rights
at the Haymarket Theatre, Sydney,
left for America last Wednesday. For
many years, as Niagara and Falls, the
act was prominent in vaudeville
throughout the world. Settling down in
Sydney, they amassed considerable pro-
perty, and their present trip is the cul-
mination of many years of arduous
work.
The Flying \\ inskillit are at present
in Schuman’s Circus, at Stockholm,
Sweden. They state that this is a fine
show, and that the trained stock is of
a very high order. The Winskills are
the only English performers . with the
show. They next do a month at the
Alhambra, Paris, and then proceed to
Germany.
JULIUS GARCIA'S MIRACULOUS ESCAPE
WOMEN shrieked and men shuddered as Julius Garcia was hurled
through space at' Wirth’s Circus on Saturday afternoon last.
MANY who witnessed the beginning of the accident closed their
in horror, and visualised a mass of manglea pulp, fam
acrobatic skill of the intrepid t rapeze performer saved his life.
i When the fitting failed, as Garcia
! was revolving at terrific speed, his
I active brain, trained to be ever ready
jto grapple with the elements of dis-
aster, worked with lightning rapidity.
Quick thinking and acting were
necessary. Below Garcia were the
heads of patrons, the circus band,
and the people in the boxes. Any of
these he might have struck, with
fatal results to himself and them.
LIFE’S SECONDS
In the few seconds from the time
the wire snapped until Garcia hit the
ground, all these obstructions loom-
ed gigantic in the man’s mind. At
all costs he must avoid them and land
clear.
And he knew also that he must
break his fall if Paul de Boult was to
retain his able assistant in one of
the most daring and thrilling acts
| ever placed before the public.
With deft twists of his agile frame,
! the acrobat veered clear of what
would otherwise have constituted hu-
man nine-pins, and he fell in the
main entranoe of the big amphi-
theatre.
PANIC
The horrified feelings of the people
rose almost to panic degree. An
awed silence reigned. Even the at-
tendants innured as they are to the
enticing adventures of such a show
r-s Wirths, seemed loth to approach
Garcia.
But it was only a momentary hesi-
tation. born of a dread of what they
might discover. Then there was a
rush to the fallen performer, an 1 a
few seconds later the ringmaster in-
timated that Garcia was not seriously
injured.
The groan that rose from the
throats of the hundreds who heard i
the announcement indicated their in-
credulity that a human could be !
dashed to earth with such tremendous j
force and escape death.
But it was happily so. Garcia’s 1
reckless courage and extraordinary'
skill had saved his life. When he
saw death grinning a>t him from the
sawdust, he began to somersault in
the air, and by this means lessened
the great momentum at which he was
travelling.
“MINOR” INJURIES j
He broke several ribs, and sustain- j.
ed other injuries, but Wirths and the
public will not lose the services if
this man, whose inimitable intrepid’ ty
is a big feature of a show studded
with thrills.
And no greater pulse-quickening :
turn than that in which Garcia figures
could be desired.
It is billed as the ‘death-defying
feat of looping the loop on a tra-
peze.’’ The performance represents a
huge wheel within a running wheel,
with both circling at a speed which!
compels spectators to hold their I
breaths in awe.
Paul de Boult, who presents the j
act, might be likened to the Earth, j
revolving, as it were, on his own < cis. i
Garcia resembles the Sun encircling [•
the Earth in orbital magnitude.
It was while swinging high that!
the accident happened, and faces
blanched sickly, and many women
fainted as the great performer hurtled
through the air towards the ground. ;
A fine sympathetic spirit was dis- ;
played by patrons of the creus, who, ;
although unnerved by the accident,
consoled themselves with the know-
ledge that, despite the extreme dar-
ing of such turns, fatalities soldo
occur.

• would pull up a few miles outside the town we proposed showing
m the following evening. -Thereupon we would select a suitable log and
get busy with the streamers that were to be put o.ut. Wall paper was
what, we used for these, with Reckitt’s Blue for the ink or coloring. The
wording we adopted was—“Wirths’ All-star Varieties Are Coming!” With
these the same night we would cover the town. Then the next day we
would enter with a band in one of the waggons.
We worked along in this way—pleasantly and profitably—till we
opposition with Ashtofi’s Circus at Kempsey. Have'l made it
cleai—that it was in the country districts of New South Wales we were
operprihg all the time? At Kempsey we decided to join Ashton. Ashton’s
1 . '' as that with us he would have a sufficiently strong combination to
visit Sydney. But the expectation was not realised.
The result of a rough-up was that we left him at Goulburn.
1 rom there we came to Sydney. Sydney was our home —all the
moie so as our mother was then living there. Finding we had nothing
else to do we decided to give a show a few yards from where the Hippo-
drome stands to-day. .We got ready—put up a tent, and arranged our
gear. All played in the band. The personnel of this was: —John the
cornet, Harry the bass, Phil the trombone, and I the horn. We could all
►.may pretty well any brass instrument. The band inside underwent all
sorts of changes, because of the work we had in turn to do in the course
ot the performance. This included tumbling, horizontal bars, Roman
rings, contortion, club-swinging, single trapeze, and double trapeze.
I was the contortionist.
• Tbe Polendric Ladder-act” was another direction in which I special-
f now that the word “polendric” has any special meaning.
But it looked and sounded well, and for that reason we retained it.
btrangely enough I haven’t seen the act done by any other performer.
. ; /bat was it? A P° le was set in the ground, with a head-piece on the top
for me to stand on my head. To reach'the top was another upright in the
form of a ladder. When I got there and was standing on my head I
would pull a hook and let the ladder fall. I would then be on the one
po's., standing on my head. Thus poised I discharged pistols, drank water
colored to look like wine, performed a series of balances, and as a finale
revolved round with fireworks blazing from me in all directions.
It was an experimental show that we gave on that occasion. We had
no idea what the outcome would be. Certainly it did not occur to us for
a moment that we were that evening laying the foundation of the enter-
prise with which we have now for years been identified.
J*
The entertainment of which I am speaking was given on New Year’s
Eve, 1880.
Such was the success of it that we opened again the following Satur-
day night. Then we continued from week to week until we were there
in all six months. The harvest we were reaping was indeed our own
undoing. Stimulated by the business we were attracting other shows had
so sprung up all around us that the place was like an English fair. The
great trouble, however, was that a lot of our rivals in their eagerness to
secure patronage gave practically the whole of their entertainment out-
side —free of charge.
My brother John often, used to sing out, “Well, now that you’ve seen
their show for nothing, come and pay a shilling, and see what we can do
—INSIDE!”
Meanwhile we had greatly strengthened our bill. The additions in-
cluded a Japanese troupe and a number of the people who had remained
behind from the Cooper-Bailey Circus. With the show we thus had we
then started out on a tour of the country towns. For this purpose we got
some horses and waggons in addition to those we already possessed—
the remnants, I mean, of the youthful venture to which I have already
alluded.
Penrith, I think, was the first town we played.
Still were we without any performing horses or trick animals. People
would call it a circus. Consequently it was a disappointment to many
that we did not have anything other than acrobatic attractions. The
outcome was that we resolved to buy and train a few ring horses.
Thus do we come to the next important development in the early
state of our affairs.
Within six months from the time we left Sydney we introduced our
first performing horse. “The Bob Walker Act” was what we did with him.
The ringman would call in a clown. “Here’s a horse for you to ride!”
he would tell him. Then followed a lot of gagging. Tremblingly the
clown would get up. Thereupon a man would call out from the audience,
“Pll show you how to ride!” —and stumble into the ring, in a pretend-
ingly tipsy condition. He would be thrown out by some of the circus at-
tendants. But, persisting in returning, he would at length be allowed to
moi.ut the horse, and thereupon give an exhibition of riding the opposite
ot what might have been expected from him. Harry was the “drunken”
man.
Of course the act could then be worked with much better effect
than is possible to-day through its having since become so well known
I have often seen the police interfere with the inebriated intruder.
Indeed at Echuca (V.) Harry was actually locked up through a constable
refusing to be persuaded that it was all in the programme—that the man
he had in charge was merely playing his part in the show.
Following this we worked up what is known as “The Indian Act.”
The routine here consists of a man aboard a horse giving an imitation of
an Indian canoeing, shooting, etc. The comedy lies in the incidental scar-
ing suffered by the clown. Then there was our third horse act, “Billy But-
tons Ride to Bradford,” introducing a number of bucking ponies, and
given as a finale to the programme.
Among our early efforts at training I must not forget the pony re-
specting which a wager is made between the ringmaster and the clown.
The ringmaster stands to win by the pony jumping a hurdle three times
m succession. The clown scores of course by the pony lying down the
third time it comes to the hurdle.
■
We worked down through New South Wales into Victoria.
AVe visited Melbourne, in the hope of playing on the flat during Cup-
day; but the people, we found, were much more interested in the races
than in us, with the result that there was nothing doing. But we didn't
mind. We joined in the gathering, and had a very pleasant day ourselves.
Afterwards we toured Victoria.
All the time we were buying more horses and waggons, improving
the quality of our acts, and building up the show generally.
Mathew Brothers’ Circus represented a formidable competitor in those
days. We dodged them wherever we could. The Mathews themselves
were brought to Australia for a pantomime by what is now the firm of
J. C. Williamson, Ltd. Then it was Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove.
The first time the Mathews were up against us was when at the outset we
were showing in Sydney. Having finished their pantomime engagement
they there embarked in an entertainment on their own account. But
while we didn’t mind them in Sydney it was different when later they be-
gan touring.
We come now to the year 1885. By that time we feared nothing.
But never for a moment did we ease up. The result was that in 1888 we
had 40 waggons, 125 horses, and 70 hands.
About this time we made our first train journey.
The circuit was Melbourne-Geelong-Ballarat-Bendigo-Melbourne. We
played all the intermediate towns in addition to the places named. The
reason why we travelled by rail was because in the meantime we wished
to get new waggons built. Shortly after this followed the discarding of
the waggons for good. The change was brought about in a very simple
manner. The horses had been left out so long that when we got going
again after travelling by train as just indicated they gave us no end of
trouble, particularly in the Gippsland district. They were in excellent
condition. But they had become so soft that we couldn’t do anything
with them. The outcome was that when we returned to Melbourne we
put the horses and waggons up for sale. “Service horses” and “perform-
ing horses” is the classification of those used in the waggons and those
used in the ring. It was of course the service horses with which we
parted. From that date (1888) we have travelled wholly by rail and boat.
I have never attempted a computation of the total we have since paid
away in fares in both directions. But it is plain that it must be something
of staggering dimensions.
The same year we went from Sydney to New Caledonia. We caught
the festive season at Noumea, beginning on July 12, and there had the
satisfaction of playing to six very big weeks. From New Caledonia we
returned to Sydney. Beginning in Adelaide with the horses in 1883 we
have since performed annually in every capital city in Australia.
, Pbe br st animal attraction we had was the riding goat, Beverley
inis was in 1889. “Beverley” it was called because that was the
name of the town in West Australia where we got it. The animal proved
a most apt student. I don’t suppose we had it a fortnight before it was
appearing in the ring. Besides merely riding the goat performed a
variety of feats on horseback such as jumping over banners and doing
headers through burning balloons. Then we got two Himalayan bears
and half-a-dozen baboons from the Melbourne ’Zoo. The baboons were
very responsive. The bears took a little longer to train. We taught
them to ride. An attractive act was that in which the baboons were
schooled. They rode, did waiters’ tricks, and walked a tight-rope. As
against these comparatively minor acts I think our most expensive animal
presentation was that in which were seen twelve polar bears, two Rus-
sian bears, and two Great Danes (dogs).
We got this from Carl Hagenbeck, Hamburg. Besides having there
the biggest ’zoo in the world Mr. Hagenbeck is unanimously conceded to
be the greatest animal trainer that ever lived.
Next I would place the act —imported from the same source —consist-
of six lionesses, two lions, two wolves, two Danes, and two ponies.
Ilnl had the training of our horses. Perhaps the most ambi-
tious animal act we ourselves produced—the Frenchman Soucie and I
were responsible for it—was that of three tigers. Two pulled a chariot
in which the other sat and drove. But the driver (“Kiddie” was his
name) was the star of the three. Besides driving he walked a tight-rope,
rode a horse, and jumped through hoops of fire.
Nationality is of no account in the training of animals. I mean that
there is no particular class of men—<for example, French, Germans, or
Italians—who can be said to excel all others in this respect.
A trainei must have no fear. If he has the animal scents it immedi-
ately. failure is the inevitable result. The quickest of all to recog-
nise any shortcoming of this character is the monkey. He knows instan-
taneously. Firmness, too, is required, with kindness and patience. Tit-
bits to eat in the way of showing approval play an important part
m the training of some animals. Horses are very fond of cut-up carrots
and loaf-sugar. Bears like milk and honey.
I regret to recall that we did not give Beverley anything, beyond a
ew pats, and telling her what a good girl she was. For Beverley bv the
way, was a nanny. ’
• , experl( ; ncb is th at all animals are very appreciative of anything
in the shape of a caress. They have a full realisation of what is meant
th ßr . avo! . T K liere is not the least doubt as to their being en-
couraged m their work by applause. I am inclined to think that they
mu sic—more or less. At any rate it has over them in turn 'a
stimulating and a reposeful influence.

The Big Parade
Who. having once seen the big parade of the circus
a its arrival in town, can ever forget the romftntie
•■ggestion of that exotic pageant and the unfailing
■ action of that mad medley of beasts, caravans,
omians, jfiants, dwarfs, freaks of all sorts, eques-
ans and equestriennes, and,, above all, the braie
hiring of a circus band? It was one of the great
veuts of circus life in the old days, particularly in
those countries where distances are not so great as
fia ■ are in this vast State of ours. It was cus-
tomary for the touring circus to stop on its way a
. 1 i 1 e or so out of the show grounds, while the artists
iodecked themselves in their finest array prepara-
trv to entering the town. First would come the
downs in their motley, then the artists, then the
menagerie. What a sight! Unhappy indeed is he
whose youth helds no fragrant memory of a circus
parade. . . . And today, the traffic problem in most
of our big cities would rule the parade out, if no
other circumstance arose to interfere with it. Still,
we are fortunate in that we are still permitted
brief glances at the anachronisms foti which circuses
are respond !jJc. Only this week, in the mundane
surround : ngs of St. George’s-terrace, a lordly ele-
phant i ggcu disdainfully at a jinker load of props
for the !>ig top. Here, we suddenly had Africa,
brought to our very doors; here we saw the might
of the animal world made the sport of a pigmy with
an iron prod, and once that peculiar, tiny cry of
the huge creature trumpeted ludicrously . . . and
the illusion of harnessed majesty was broken. Still,
there it was; for a second we had caught a fleeting
gli;, rbc vpirit. <v ■>,« Civ - . that .sneer world
of contradictions tha. are stranger tliae truths, and
of shams which often make realities blush.
The circus has altered greatly in the past decade
or so and if modernity has robbed it of some of its
romantic charm, it has also robbed it of some of its
less desirable influences.
Mr. Clyde Ingalls, one of America’s oldest show-
men, o in w, on the heels of every circus in the
old days, came a nondescript crowd of lemonade and
peanut vendors, together with pickpockets, card-
sharpers, and gamblers of various sorts. The show-
men. according to Mr. Ingalls, used to lease to these
rogues the pickpocket and gambling rights or conces-
sions, in return for a share of the profits. Indeed,
he says, many shows could not have continued to
pay their way without the income derived from this
sou re ■ The on. sfom was so well recognised that
whenever a show changed hands, the extent of the
profit - derived from t hese transactions often iu-
flueneeu the price! Those days have long gone. . .
The Happy Freaks
One feature of circus life that seems, at least to
the layman, to be fast disappearing, is that which
was contributed by the “freaks” —those dwarfs,
Siamese twins, bearded women, living skeletons, and
the hundred and one other strange personalities
that made this section of the entertainment weird
and wonderful. Of course, there are still freaks in
many circuses—they seem to have retained all their
popularity in America, much more, perhaps, than
they have in England—but the monstrosities and
repugnant prodigies of nature common to earlier
days of circus shows are no longer included. Many
of these latter had merely a physiological interest,
and might better have been left to the anatomical
museums and similar repositories, but the taste of
the age was not yet able really to discriminate
between the bizarre and intriguing and the repulsive
a’id horrible.
Among all exhibited freaks, possibly the most
famous, perhaps the best documented, appear to have
been the Siamese Twins, who died in America 50
years o. They were born near Bangkok in 1811,
and King Cbowpahyi, of Siam, hearing of their
birth, ordered them to be put to death for fear that
the existence of such beings portended evil for his
kiugdom. However, he was eventually persuaded to
let them live. They were taken first to 'Amorim,
then to England, by a British merchant named Hun-
ter, and they soon became world-famous. It is said
that despite their enforced propinquity, they quarrel-
led but. once, and that was when one wanted a bath
and the other protested because it was too cold !
Once, while on exhibition with a circus in New!
York, they noticed a one-eyed man among the
audience, whereupon they inquired how much he had
paid for admission. On learning that he had paid
the same as other people, they directed that half be
refunded, a. with one eye, he had not the same ad-
vantage as the others!
But this is a digression. . . . Freaks, of course,
make a perennial demand on our sympathy, yet they
are, according to the vast experience of Mr. Ingalls
again, not by any means as unfortunate as some
people, imagine. In the first place, he says, they
enjoy being looked at, and literally thousands of
men and women aspire to be among their number!
The scrutiny of thousands of more or less vulgar
sightseers is to the freaks what applause is to the
artist, and when they travel in public they will often
deliberately go out of their way in order to attract
attention. ” It is quite easy to understand that the
freak'in a travelling show or a circus hasi a much
better time than he would have at home, where lie
would be regarded and treated as an outcast. In
the circus a freak commands a big salary—Mr. In-
galls is responsible for the statement that a good
freak “act” demands £5OO a week on British and
American music halls —he is well housed and fed,
and -he enjoys the companionship of his kind.
Circus [Turns
The Kind of turn that novf seems suitable for
circus presentation embraces animal acts, feats of
strength and balance, clowning demonstrations of
physical skill and dexterity, and balance. It is not
always so.
Barnum, that great showman whose reputation is
still a vivid thing even to generation!? wlio did not
know him, once aroused a violent controversy in the
scientific world by exhibiting an cmidentified monster
of prehistoric days, with reliable testimony as to
how and where it was found. As ft matter of fact,
it: was constructed of horses* bones and the skeletons
of fishes! Barnum'was a remarkable exploiter of
every likely and unlikely opportunity. A pickpocket
was once arrested in bis grounds and taken to jail.
The jail was full, so Barnum offered to take charge
of him. The next day the circus’s great attraction
was the tent in which the pickpocket, wa« on show !
Authenticated tales of this 'sort do more than
anything else to color for us the picture of circus
life, with its vicissitudes and pleasures, and its
nomadic, independence of life which serves to sharpen
the wits to a metallic keenness.
Naturally enough, acrobatic venturings, equestrian
turns, clowning and its kindred manifestations of
humor are the most favored circps turns, but, as has
been shown, nothing that offers novelty is turned
away by the good showman.
For instance, the story is told of a famous circus
proprietor (either Barnum or Wombwell), who was
aggrieved on arriving late at an English fairtown to
discover his rival already in occupancy of the best
circus site in the place. To add to this grievance the
latecomer's elephant had died of the exhaustion of the
forced march that had been made across country, and
the rival sc.vn became aware of this happening, “The
Only Live Elephant in the Fair’” proudly announced
a placard, which soon floated ove* Ms show.
But then came a triumph of showmanship. The
owner of the departed beast immediately countered
with a larger, more glaring sign—-
“The Only Dead Elephant in the Fair I”
It was a howling success. He was right in his
estimate of crowd psychology. The people had often
seen a live elephant; few, if any, had ever seen the
pachyderm dead ... They flocked in. That is the
sort of showmanship that can and does make circuses
famous.
A hard life, this life of the Big Top—but do its
followers find'it hard? Go down now, near the Es-
planade, and ask them .... Probably you will hear
again that ideal of the farm or the poultry run, hut
if you were to encounter the same performers ten or
twenty years hence, and even though they have in-
herited riches in the meanwhile, the probability is you
will still find them somehow near the circus, in some
capacity or other.
It’s in the blood .....

FATAL EXPLOSIONS.
TWO CIRCUS MEN
KILLED.
.ACCIDENT AT BLAYNEY.
SYDNEY, June 3.
A terrific explosion at Sole’s Circus,
which arrived at Blayne.v on Saturday,
resulted in two persons being killed.
The circus was about to be lit up- for
the evening performance, when the acety-
lene gas plant exploded. W. Sole (the
proprietor) and C. lyroni were killed.
PARTICULARS OF THE EXPLOSION.
The explosion occurred while repairs
were being effected to a leaky pipe on
the acetylene gas generator. A portable
electric lighting plant having failed, it
was decided to requisition an old acety-
lene plant carried for emergencies.
Messrs. Sole and Perry were working
together, and discovered a leak in the
pipe used for conveying the gas from
the cylinder. The pipe was bound round
with tape to prevent the escape of gas.
By this time it was quite dark, and one
of the men, evidently with tlie intention
of seeing if the leak # had been stopped,
struck a mkteh. There was immediately
a loud explosion, and both men were
thrown on their backs some distance
away. William Alfred Sole was aged
54, and married. He was one of the pro-
prietors of the circus, which was re-
cently purchased. Charles Henry Perry j
was 55 years of age, and married, and i
was professionally know as “From.”
Strangely enough; one of the ladies
associated with the show had a present-
ment, and had spokeu of it, saying the
visit to Blayney would be ill-fated.
Members of the company ran to the two
men, and it was at once seen that Perry
was dead. His skull had been cleaved
right down the centre. Mr. Sole was
terribly bruised about the face and
head, and expired in a few minutes.
Both men were members of the Victorian
Constitution of the Masonic Order, and i
were well known and highly respected '
showmen right throughout the Common-
wealth. and New Zealand. Mr. Sole left a j
widow, three sons, and three daughters, j
all employed in the circus, and Mr. I
Perry a widow and four sons, who as- :
sis ted in the circus management.
“MAN IN BATH”
Death of Trooper Rolfe
VICTIM OF TERRIBLE GAS
SYDNEY, Tuesday.—Trooper !
Samuel Earl Rolfe. known as “the j
man in the bath,” died at the
Prince of Wales Military Hos-
pital, Rand wick, last night.
With bis death goes one of the
most pathetic relics of the war.
Poisoned by musatrd g as, he has
been without an inch of skin on his
body for more than five years. Dur-
ing that time be had lived in a bath
of tepid water, suffering indescribable
agony, but always bearing it stoically
with a smile.
“Well, anyway,” he would say to
visitors, “a bloke can't get much
worse.”
Rolfe went away with the 18th
Battalion in June 1915, fought at
Anzac, and later in France.
A herbalist at Newtown succeeded
in gating a new skin on him.
“I thought I was right,’ said the
digger not long ago, “but I peeled
again.”
LETTERS FROM ALL PARTS
The publicity given to bis s..nr.,
here and in other parts of the • or id
brought cheesing cm p m.dencc
from Alaska, Norm China, trioa,
Scotland, England and all parts of
America.
Recently one of his greatest friends,
herself suffering from a skin disease,
died.
A Macquarie street specialist, who
was helping the patient, recently im-
ported a new bath from Vienna, with
which to begin a new treatment.
AN ELDERLY ELEPHANT.
One of the pecs of Wirth’s Circus is the
huge elephant known as Princess AlLc
The princess is getting on in years, for
Messrs. George and Philip Wirth acquiree
her from Mr. William Anderson, the well-
known theatrical manager, about 20 years
ago, and he purchased her from Bostock
and Wombwell, at the time that organi-
sation broke up in Melbourne, dispos:ng
of one of the finest menageries in iht
world- There is a romance in connection |
with the career of Princess Alice, for it is
believed that she was the elephant wtiicu
caused an outburst of public indignation
in England many years ago, when the
famous Jumbo was sold to Barnum and
Bailey. Alice was Jumbo’s loving mate
at the London Zoo for many years, and
people who knew of the affection exist-
ing between the two elephants were hor-
rified when it was proposed to separate
them, and the newspapers were flooded
with letters of protest- However, the
contract was made, and Jumbo was duly
delivered in New York. He met his
death soon after in pathetic circum-
stances, for seeing a baby elephant stand-
ing bewildered on the railway line at
a level-crossing, as a train was approach-
ing, he rushed foxward and pushed the
smaller animal clear, but. was caught b>
the train himself and cut to pieces. Alice-
was afterwards sold to the Bostock and
Wombwell combination, and it is be-,
lieved that Princess Alice must be fully
120 years old.
Will Rogers Pays a Tribute
To Calvin Coolidge's Widow
To the Editor of The New York Times:
SANTA MONICA, Cal., Jan. 8.
—-To Mrs. Coolidge:
Mrs. Coolidge, your husband’s
head rests today not alone on his
Vermont soil but pillowed on the
sincere tributes of the millions
he served.
Every writer has written of the
amazing hold he had on his coun-
trymen and they attributed it to
various causes. Now, that he is
beyond the receipt of more honor,
what about the “amazing hold"
you have on our people.
Naturally you aided your hus-
band’s career. All wives do that.
But what made you so beloved
by the people? Overnight you
were swept into the highest po-
sition that can be held by an
American woman. Other “first
ladys” had had perhaps greater
advantages—training, background
and social distinction—but you
showed that which teaching,
travel and social association can’t
compete with something that
was born in you, a native dignity,
a serenity, a modest graciousness
that endears you to all.
Calvin Coolidge left a great les-
son to our government in “com-
mon sense.” Yours is just as
great a lesson to your sex, a
homely loveliness, and, above all,
a consideration for the feelings
of others, which constitutes a
real lady, be she pauper or
queen.
Yours,
WILL ROGERS.

Renewal of Wiliam Patrick
Kinney’s licence of the Centra’
Hotel, Bourke street, Melbourne,
was opposed by the police in the
Licensing Court today, on the
ground of alleged service of liquor
aft i e nspe°ctor J. J. Croagh explained
that two men were put in the'hotel
for a week-end to find out what was
t ’°C<fnstable Joseph Thomas White, of
Williamstown, said he went to Kin-
ney's Hotel on a Saturday at the end
of November,* and stayed until Mon-
day. At 6.15 on Saturday night he
saw in a passage about 40 men being
served with liquor from a cupboard.
The licensee was getting the men out,
but others were coming in.
When the bell rang Kinney went to
the door. If he knew the men they
were admitted. The men were asked
if they were booked up. Some re-
plied “Yes,” others “No.” To those
who answered in, the negative, Kin-
ney said: “I will have to get you
booked up.” If the men were not
known the glasses were cleared away.
The licensing police called about
7.30, but before they entered the
glasses were put away. There were
then three or four men sitting in
the lounge near the dining-room. One
man wanted' to erear out, but Kinney
said to him, “Stay where you are,
you ore all right. You are in for
tea if asked questions.”
“BUSINESS AS USUAL.”
“The police questioned the men,”
i witness continued, 4 and when they
| had gone the licensee opened the cup-
board again, and said, ‘Business as
usual, boys. They mean to get me,
but 1 don’t think they will. I might
ben.l the law a little, but .1 don t
break it.’ UA
“Later the .licensee said he vas
going to the Stadium, and added, 1
must get you boys who are not stop-

a little after 11 p.m. A good number
of men came in, and drinks were
served again from the cupboard m
the passage. _ n n __
“This continued until L4O a.m.

Mr E. Gorman (for Kinney): Did
it not appear that the hoik of
men were legitimate boarders. tint
Witness: No. My opinion is that
they were not' legitimate boarders.
Many of them were employes of
Wirths’ Circus? —Yes. . , . .
Allen Ernest Skiller, who said he
was “attached to the Licensing
branch,” gave evidence on sirnilax
lines. He said that he saw Kinney
pack two bags with bottles of
liquor. One was given to a man and
the other was taken into a lane.
The chairman (Mr It. Barr): Here
is & licensee who W3*s cli<illenffea rtu
the outset. He was allowed a licence
here, and immediately gives trouble.
This hotel has had a country trade
for many years. It is difficult to de-
tect this class of offence in such cir-
cumstances. 1 cannot see why an
inspector should take the trouble
that has been taken in this case un-
less he thought he had good reason.
My experience is that the average in-
spector plays fairly. He knows there
is temptation to licensees at times
which is hard to resist, and allow-
ances are made for human nature.
Mr Gorman: This was an isolated
occasion which would occur onL
once in a year,
BANQUET TO FRIENDS
Ivinney stated that he had gi\ en a
banquet to the circus people and it
was possible some liquor might lia\e
been served. He did pack a bag o
liquor for the ringmaster. He had
had the licence since August 1. The
police had visited his hotel about -s
j times. . i
I Mr Barr (to Mr Gorman): How
would it do if Kinney were put on
probation?
Mr Gorman: Yes, and Kinney
I might then be prepared to consider
the advisability of not resisting m
future if the licensing authorities in-
timate their desire that he should
cease to hold a licence,
i Mr Barr: The probation I have in
! mind is that we adjourn the renewal
| until the 'end of January.
This course was adopted.

For Wirth’s Circus
SOME HEALTHY APPETITES
Some eat meat, some eat gram
some eat hay, some eat nuts, some
mash— hut all eat heartily.
Catering for the inner lion, tiger,
hippopotamus, elephant, horse
what-not, is one of the big
-jobs in Wirth’s Circus. Individual
tastes have to be considered and ap-
petites must be fully satisfied.
The advance agent of the circus ar-
ranges to obtain locally, in each town
where the circus stops, the uecessaiy
supplies. ,
Consider the elephants alone. 11 esc

stantly—get through liewt ot hay a

break them open, throw the hay on the
turf in front of each beast, in eqiial
shares. Trunks wrap round adequate
mouthfuls. Alice, head of the band,
with her customary greediness, sly J
drags into her own heap of hay about
half of her neighbour s share, and be-
gins to eat as fast as she can. But even
though the neighbour does not protest

DEATH OF GEORGE L. PETERSEN
One who will be missed when
Wirths’ Circus comes around is Mi
George L. Petersen, who tor 35 years
has been advance agent for the big
touring organisation, and has just
passed away at Ohakune attei a shoit
illness. He arrived m Inv^ c
in advance of the circus at the end
of December, but a tew weeks ago
his health failed, and he wen- tc
May with his sister, Mrs. J. Kearns,
of Ohakune. Mr. Petersen had made
numerous tours and was well known
in all parts of Australia and New
Zealand. He is survived by his wife
and a grown-up son and daughter,
who live in Sydney. Mr. Rud Petei
sen. manager of the Tivoli Theatre,
Auckland, is a brother. Aijotliei b
ther Mr. O. Petersen, and a smtci,
Mrs Walter Scott, are residents o
Christchurch. A tribute paid the late
Mr. Petersen by Mr. Stanley Gran ,
business manager of the J. C. WilUai
son Comic Opera Company, sums UE
the general opinion concerning an
able and cheery personality wnenl
said' “He was probably the best
known advance agent in New Zea-
land and Australia to circus artists
and to the general public. What <
did not know about the cncuo busi
ness was not worth knowing,
helped largely to make Wiiths the
leading circus of New Z( >aland and
Australia, and he knew every inch of
the ground on which the tents could
be pitched. Moreover, he had a com-
plete knowledge of all the require-
ments of both staff and animals. The
public have no idea of the amount of
work entailed in acting as
aeent for a circus, and Mi. Peteisei
was very seldom known to make a
mistake. The sympathy, of the vhole
of the ‘show profession will go
to his relatives, and I am sure that
there will be universal regret «,t his
death.”
Mrs. Phil Percival, who has been
in Auckland for some time now, holds
down a nice position in one of the
business establishments of that city.

Ii is a tradition of the circus that
the manager is serenaded on the
morning of his birthday, and when
the word was given the bandsmen de-
cided that to break tradition was
worse than breaking a pledge, so
with instruments in hand they wend-
ed their way to the front of the Me-

COOTAMUNDRA SENSATION
ANIMAL ATTACKS STOCK
RECAPTURED AFTER SHOOTING
SYDNEY, Feb. 19.
During a circus performance at
Cootamundra a lion escaped while be-
ing returned to its cage. After pass-
ing the front seats, it made out of the
tent.
Gathering up some cows and calves
in an adjoining paddock, it commenced
to drive them towards town,
i It then attacked a, pony tied u£ ir.
& shed, and was sucking the blood from
a hole in its neck when it was dis-
turbed. The pony was destroyed.
A large crowd, afoot and in motor-
cars, engaged in the pursuit. Alter
passing down several streets, the. lion
crossed a bridge, where the spotlights
of two cars were focussed upon it.
A local resident landed a shot behind
the animal’s shoulders and partly dis-
abled it. The lion then took refuge
on the steps of to building, where the
keepers who had arrived with a. cage,
managed to capture it, after it had
been at liberty for an hour and a-half.
Mr. Val Royal, who died at the Prince
Alfred Hospital on Thursday, after a
prolonged illness, was musical director
of Fullers’ Theatres for the past tour
years. Mr. Royal enlisted in 1910, and
I served for three and a half years with
i the Mining Battalion, After the Armis-
I tice he was selected to lead a concert
' party with the 18th Batt., and conducted
! the first Australian Jazz Band m Pans.
Although only 34 years of age, Mr.
I Royal had been for some years promi-
j riently associated with many, principall
theatres throughout Australia in a musi- j
■ cal capacity. He was a brother of Miss
j Chrissie Royal, the well-known dancing

ROGUE ELEPHANTS
ALL-NIGHT FIGHT
TERRIFIES VILLAGE
Tlt*> unusual spectacle of a fierce
fight between two wild elephants,
lastingi for many hours, and ulti-
mately resulting in the deaths of
the co(mbatants, was witnessed at
the Raikha mines, about 20 miles
from Jahshedpur. The death
struggle of the huge tuskers, ac-
companied by loud bellowing and
trumpeting wild stampeding,
created consternation among the
villagers.in tfce neighborhood, who
adopted ewery (conceivable means of
defence against probable attacks.
The origin of the fight is unknown®
but it was evident: that the elephants!
had commenced fighting some tinui
during the day on a neighboring hill.
Eventually they came down from thßi
hills, and the struggle took a desperate
turn after dusk, when the combatants
reached the residential quarters of th 4
employees of the copper mines. There
they commenced to fight in earnest
The inhabitants fled *.n all direct
tions, only a few remaining in the®
houses, overcome by fear that at ans
moment the tuskers might crush theis
along with their homes (says th#.
Calcutta “Statesman”).
THE VANQUISHED 1
I. Throughout the night the fight xxm*
tinued opposite the hospital. As
light broke the noise subsided, and thi
frightened villagers concluded thai
the animals had disappeared into th«
jungle. On venturing out of doors
they were surprised to find one of thd
elephants lying dead in a ditch, be*
smeared with blood, with its head
smashed, and wounds and bruises all
over its body.
Both tusks were broken, and th«*
parts were missing. It was there*
fore suspected that some thought-
ful person had watched the fight
throughout the night, and when the
end had come had stolen the
broken tusks.
A number of aborigines arrived o 4
the scene with axes and knives in or-
der to profit from the fight by remove
ing the tusks, tail, and hide, but whets
they discovered that the most valuable
parts had already disappeared they
left.
Throughout the morning the roaringf
of the other elephant >yas heard in tha
jungle, but the villagers were too
scared to investigate. Next day in*
formation was received that the animal
had been found dead about 10 miles
off, and to the surprise of the dis-
coverers it was found to have foup
tucks. Besides its awn tusks, por-
tions of the other elephant’s tusks wer<|
found driven deep into the side of on#
eye and by the side of the trunk.
WILD ELEPHANTS
The presence of wild etephants is not
a very uncommon feature in these
parts, and they have bee© seen several
times in and around Ghatfcila, a health,
resort a few miles off £rom Rakha.
These herds of elephants visit paddy
fields, coming down fronp the hills
where tigers are also plentiful. On
several occasions one or twc young ele-
phants have been found loitering neap
the fields in the early morning, evi-
dently in search of the herd which ha 4
already left before dawn.
On one occasion a dead elephant
was found leaning against di hfHdcA
in a standing position attout 1%
miles from Ghatsila. Wild •!**•
phants also abound in tl«v hit®
south of Jamshedpur, and In (tttf
Dalma Hills northward. i

as to cause little or no inconvenience.
The petrol pipe broke and the machine

was done to either Miss Staig or the
machine, although the lady was sitting
on the machine when the flare-up oc-
curred. I would like you to publish
this statement of the affair, otherwise
some managements may be under the
impression that we use flaming hoops
in the act, and this may mitigate
against engagements in some of the

CIRCUS !M
WHO TRAINS ANIMALS
Kindness snd Severity
hat brutality does nothing but an-
..agomse the animal, while kindness and
severity- as distinct from cruelty—will
always have the desired result, was vhe
opinion expressed this morning by Mr H
Mooney, of Wirths’ Circus, when discuss--
Img Lie methods adopted when trainin'*
j animals.
I . Mr - M ooney said he had had an exten-
j siv.j experience in animal training, and bad
i round that a rebuke when necessary, and
a reward when earned, made the animal
riot h
Docile and Lovable.
He had been with Wirths’ for four years,
and had been closely associated with the
training of the elephants.
, * iave f. OUI, d the elephant a most in-
telligent animal,” he said, “and, like
most other animals, if you treat them
j kindly, hut are always strict, thev will
soon learn -what you want them to learn.
| y alienee is the main requirement, and
j trainer must he prepared to keep on
illustrating what he wants done. For m-
I stance, if you want an elephant to lift
; you must keep on lifting it vour-
yep until ho understands what you want,
eventually h- will understand, and pro-
vided ho is kept at it, will never forget.”
■Mr Mooney said he had also been en-
gaged in the
Training of Lions and Bogs.
! h ( - said, training was a more
j <.ifncu.lt .10 b than that of training ele-
! phants- It was first necessary to make
! !e . on ’ a naturally ferocious animal,
pudise tnat the man is the master, and
that could only he done by force.
_ Lut it is no good being brutal,” he
said. “Yon must combine force with
kindness, and, as with the elephant, when
nm [ion’s ferociousness has been over
come, you must lie patient and keep on
illustrating the tricks. As for dogs, all
Mint is required is kindness. Brutality
\nll only make the dog run awav every
time he sees you.”
Mi. Mooiwy said that the training of
animals was a business demanding pati-
ence, hut the reward came when the
trainer realised that the animal both loved
and obeyed him. “It is a great thin" to
see an animal working willingly,” he said,
and 1 would like to see more people in-
terested. A t present T know of only one
schoolmaster who
Appreciates the Education
the-e animals offer. He is at Beverlev, j
W estern Australia, and whenever our ole- i
phants are there, ho brings out bis school !
childion to watch them.”
WIRE WALKER'S ORDEAL
DIZZY FIFTY FEET FROM GROUND
GRIM FIGHT TO HANG ON.
‘‘ Everything went black my
eyes; I clutched at the rope with •both
hands, locked my arms round it, and
clung on as tightly as I could.”
This was how twenty-one-year-old
Lucie Wallenda, the high-wire walker
of the Great Wallenda troupe, attached
to Bertram Mills’ Circus, described to a
reporter a terrifying experience. She
almost fainted as she stepped off a nar-
row platform 50ft above the ring during
a performance in Bristol.
“ It was the heat at the top of the
tent and the sultry, thundery weather
that made me go dizzy,” Lucie said.
“ We had just finished our most diffi-
cult act, and as I started to climb down
my head seemed to go round and round.
“ I knew that I must not relax until
help reached me. I wanted to faint,
but I dare not. How long I hung
there I do not know, but at last I was
caught in the arms of someone and
lifted on to the safety of the little plat-
form. It was only then that I was
able to relax and fall back exhausted.
“ It was a terrifying experience, and
it was the first time that I have gone
dizzy while 1 have been aloft.”
Miss Wallenda soon recovered, and
resumed her daring acts.

£BOO DAMAGE
TO CIRCUS
Tent Wrecked
Beyond Repair
Wirth’s Circus was laid in temporary
ruin by the gales of last night. The
main tent, estimated to be worth £BOO,
was irreparably wrecked. Its stout can-
vas was like tissue paper in the grip
of fierce winds, which swept from the
river.
Wirth’s, while disappointed, was not
perturbed, and immediately set about
restoring order so as to avoid all pos-
sible disturbance with their schedule.
This morning huge gaping holes in
the canvas testified to the force of rhe
wind. The two massive king poles which
bear the weight of the main structure,
stood erect as if proud of their survival,
but from a high overhead wire the tra-
peze flapped forlornly in the wind. Every
stitch of canvas had to be removed,
every stage of seating dismantled and
the whole work of construction entered
upon once more.
None seemed to mind. The quality of
philosophy is deeply grained in the cir-
cus staff. Supervisors quietly issued their
instructions, and, wrapping themselves
in pieces of canvas, which one jocularly
described as his opera cloak, attendants
went zealously about their task as care-
free as though nothing untoward had
happened.
Wirth’s secretary (Mr. .f. Moore-
Murphy) estimated the damage to the
main tent at £BOO. There is always a
spare one with the show, and one re-
cently made in Sydney at a cost of
£l5OO is awaiting delivery. The damaged
canvas will serve now only for patch-
work.
The menagerie tent collapsed gently,
king pole and all, ripping where it came
into contact with the cages. Stitching
will repair it. The animals were un-
moved.
ONLY A TRIFLE
‘‘We have had worse blows than that,”
Mr. Murphy said, cheerfully, emphasis-
ing the point that not a single rope had
been dislodged, He recalled that on one
occasion at Ballarat, on a Christmas
Eve the tent collapsed during a gale,
while the show was in progress, but the
only real difficulty for the directors was
subsequently to restore the numerous
handbags and hats found on the prem-
ises to the rightful owners. At Napier
(N.Z.) two years ago, the tent was
levelled at 4 p.m. on the day of opening,
but everything had been got right and
the show went on four hours later.
“In our 50 years existence nobody
has been seriously hurt in such occur-
rences.” Mr. Murphy remarked when
pointing out that the dangers were ima-
ginary rather tlian real. He expressed
regret that the flood waters caused so
much inconvenience to the cars of pat-
rons last night. Members of the staff
had given a hand in getting cars into
action, a service for which the ele-
phants are usually found invaluable, but
in the stress of last night’s storm this
co-operation could not be granted.
It is a coincidence that when Wirib’s
were last in Perth two years ago floods
caused the postponement of one of the
night performances.
With the prospect of inclement condi-
tions continuing tonight, the directors of
the circus decided today to resume the
show at the matinee tomorrow. There
will be no performance tonight.
The re-splicing of ropes and the trans-
fer of fittings from the damaged tent to
that will take its place, caused a
burner search to be made in the city
today for sailmakers. of whom 14 were
immediately pressed into service.

I visit for one night’s performance. My
Circus will be playing in Hughenden
next week, and for the benefit of
your readers, also for your Hughen-

our last visit totalled £B9/12/, not over
±3OO as mentioned by your correspond-
ant, my books are open for his or any
other persons inspection to show that
my statement as to the takings is
correct. As your correspondent states
business is better lately owing to vari-
ous functions, and if our takings are
to exceed £3OO it will be a great boon
to the Hughenden business people, be-
cause for every 5/ that I get for en-
tertaining the public, the tradespeople
get £5 from the farmers and graziers,
the backbone of Australia. We should
be encouraged to visit these country
towns, seeing the number of bush
people who come into the town to
visit the circus, and incidently spend
money on their requirements in the
local shops. Yours, etc..
PHILIP WIRTH,
Governing Director Wirth Bros.’ Cir-

NAZI TERRORISM.
CIRCUS HISTORY.
Fifty Years on Tour.
j9on of a circus proprietor and father
of three girls who appear- in his present
show, Mr. Philip Wirth. one of the direc-
tors of Wirth Bros.’ Circus, yesterday
gave some interesting details of a family
connection, now extending into the third
generation, with that form of entertain-
ment which has made his name a house
( hold word through Australia and known
to many -thousands, overseas.
i . H-r. Wirth said that his father ran a
circus in Victoria numy years ago, hut
it was no-t a financial success and, after
a period which lie spent digging for gold,
he joined up with Barlow’s Circus a year
before his death in 1878. Jn 1878 Mr.
Wirth (then 14 years of age), with his
three brothers started a small aerobatic
show in which he and one of his bro-
thers provided the greatest draw with
their cornet solos. At first they had no
animals, but in 1880 they had acquired
a number of houses and had made a circus
tent, and in that year they started on
a tour of Victoria with a little circus,
which gathered strength as they went
along. . In 1889 they came to Western
Australia and spent a couple of years
touring this State prior to visiting New
Zealand, but they returned to Western
Australia at the time of the Oyolganfie
gold rush in 1892 and spent some time
81 .Albany. In 1890 his brother, Harry
Wirth, went to America and returned
with a troup of 10 cowbows and 10 Indians
, with two squaws and two papooses. Thin
show was run throughout Australia for
a couple of years until the bank smash
in Victoria drove the brothers to South
Africa. The director of the Adelaide
Zoo (Mr. (Minchin) fitted them out for a
tour of that country with an Australian
menagerie, including kangaroos (which
proved a great draw amongst the Boers),
dingoes, wombats, pelicqnn, etc.
1 While in South Africa, Mr. Wirth said
General Botha presented him with half-
a-d-ozen zebras and the stubborn brutes
almost caused the circus to miss certain
of its towns through the length of time
it used to take to 'get theim int-o the
trucks. As a return for what Mr. Min-
chin had done for them Mr. Wirth said
he gave him two of these zebras for the
South Australian Zo«o and four big ba-
booms, which had been taught by the Boers
\ O ... sn;K> ho pipes. The Jamieson raid in
1894 drove the circus out of South Africa
1 and the brothers decided on a tour of
South America which lasted until 1897.
During the latter part of that year and
in 189-8 they toured (England, amongst
tbear- patrons in the latter year being the
j late King Edward (then Prince of Wales j
i who was greatly impressed with the way
in which a team of brumby ponies in the
circus went through military drill by word
of command.
The circus then went back to South
Africa and was still -there when the Boer
War broke out. Theirs was the last train
to cross the M-odder Hiver bridge from
Kimberley before it was blown up by
Cronje, During the trouble which had
led *up to the outbreak of hostilities the
Wirth Bros, had remained strictly im-
partial and had refused the use of their
tent to -both sides. For that reason
Cronje refused to commandeer the circus
horses when the suggestion was put to
him. From (South Africa the brothers
toured India and Java where they saw
the use to which elephants were being
put sawing and transporting timber. Mr.
iVirlh promptly made up his; mind to ac-
quire an elephant to do the circus haul-
age and he has used elephants for that
purpose ever since. In 1900 the circus
returned to Australia and has not left it
since. “Nor do I intend to leave it
again,” added Mr. Wirth, “for there is
no ccjUntry in the world to equal Aus-
tralia either for climate otr of resources.”
For the present season of ten nights
in I- -th Mr. Wirth said the circus was
pres-e ting practically a new show. (Prob-
ably the most remarkable turn was the
performing bears which were almost hu-
man in the things they did on bicycles,
scooter:-! and skatee. As a final piece
of family history Mr. Wirth said he had
just returned from training hi*s third,
daughter, who V 20 years of age. in the
“bounding jockey” act as they called the '

ALLEGATIONS OF THEFT.
CIRCUS ATTENDANT’S GASE.
ONE CHARGE DISMISSED.
A circus attendant, John Mahuta Par-
ker, aged 25, was charged in the Police
Court yesterday with the theft of £5O,
the property of Golda Honey, one of the
performers.
Complainant said when the circus
arrived in Auckland accused helped to
remove some of the luggage from the > car-
riage occupied by her family. She missed
her vanity case containing £5O.
Alfred Honey said the case was re-
covered from a circus waggon. There was
then only £4 in it.
John Bernard said he saw accused hand-
ling the case. He deposited it in a wag-
gon.
Detective Knight said accused denied
seeing the C3se at any time.
The magistrate, Mr. Hunt: It is sus-‘
picious, but I will gve him the benefit of
the doubt. ,
The case was dismissed.
Accused was subsequently charged with
the theft of £l5 at' Timaru and of an
overcoat at Wellington. He pleaded
guilty to both charges and was remanded
for a week for sentence.


CIRCUS TRAGEDY.
TRAPEZE ARTIST’S DEATH.
Evidence at Inquest. ,
During a matinee performance at Wirth’s j
Circus on October 24 Valma Harvey, aged j
2(5 years, of the United States of America,
it member of the Lamar troop of flying
acrobats, received fatal injuries when she i
fell a distance of about 15ft. from a tra-'
peze, struck the edge of a safety net. and j
fell from there into some seats round the j
arena. The accident was caused by the j
fact that she failed to secure a firm grip of :
her partner’s hands and was dashed i
.against a wall of the circus. The city
coroner (Mr. D. Berriman, P.M.) held an
inquest on Friday.
Vincent Lawler, trapeze artist, appear-
l' : with the “Flying. Lamars” at Wirth sj
< ncus, South Melbourne, said: —On Oc-
tober 24 our troupe was doing a turn. 1
was standing on a pedestal waiting for mv
turn. I saw Valma Harvey, whose pro-
ssional name was Valma Lamar, strike ’
the western wall of the building. She then
fell and struck the edge of the safety net,!
and from there fell on to some seats be-
neath. She had just turned a somersault i
from the trapeze and had been caught by !
another member of the troupe. She
slipped, however, and fell. Valma Harvey j
had been with the circus for about two ,
rears. There is a safety net about oott
long and 10ft. wide underneath. I suppose
the net would be rather dangerous it one ,
fell into, it, but we never do fall into it,
This was an accident that would never
happen again. .. i
The Coroner. —How do you know that *
it would never happen again? ;
Witness.—Well 1 do not see how it could
happen again. 1 do not know how it came ,
to happen on this occasion.
Betty Phillips, a member ot the Flying
Lamars” act,, said:—On October 4 1 was |
on the catch trapeze, and Valma Lamar;
was waiting on the pedestal. She swung
towards me and turned a single somer-
sault. We caught hands and swung to-
wards the western wall of the arena
Talma’s hands slipped from mine, and she
struck the wall. She fell into the net,
and then bounced out into the seats.
The Coroner. —You know this accident •
might happen again. I understand that;
Vincent Lawler lias taken Y alma Lamars
place now. Suppose when you are doing
vour act to-night lie was to miss Ins grip,
would not he be killed also .
Witness.—l do not see how it could
Mr Berriman. —But it did happen, jou
know, and it might happen again
The coroner record : ending of acci-
dental death.
A LION AT LARGE.
EXCITEMENT AT HAWERA.
SMOTHERED IN A CARPET.
“Mummy, there’s a big dog in the back
yard,’’ cried a tiny tot as he rushed into,
his mother’s house, not old enough to
realise that Leo, the lion, and the king of
beasts, was wrathfully tearing around the
i cabbage patch trying to evade recapture
by his keeper. The lion was too intent
upon the movements of his pursuers to
take much notice of the child or the con-
sequences might have been disastrous, for
the brute was furiously angry and charged
; at bis keepers several times before he was
smothered with a carpet and finally
i secured.
The occurrence took place at Hawera.
j A travelling circus had pitched near tho
gasworks and a young lion and lioness
not much more than a year old, but fully
grown, were rehearsing ring tricks. With-
out warning, the lion, instead of jumping
through a hoop,' sprang with wonderful
agility to the top of the side of the cage,
a height of, about 16ft., and paused there
i for some time before making his final
plunge for liberty. The attendants rushed
for a pole to push him back into the cage,
hut Leo sprang to the ground and bounded
off in the direction of a private cottage
close to the gasworks. A crowd of
people gathered about the circus watch-
ing the animals pell-mell in
every direction, but the lion made straight
for the hedge surrounding the cottage and
cleared it into the garden, to the con-
sequent surprise and wonderment of the
small boy.
The circus attendants made great efforts
to capture the now wildly-excited animal,
but to approach it required no little nerve.
A carpet was requisitioned. While the
attendants ivere trying to ensnare the lion
in its folds, the beast fiercely charged
them several times. Finally the carpet
was thrown over the brute, which exerted
all its great strength to get free. Ten
men were all but inadequate to hold the
lion down, but a collar was at last fas-
tened abqut its neck, and it was dragged
back to its mate in the cage, very much
to the relief of the neighbourhood.
REVOLVERS FOR CIRCUS.
arms not registered.
Possession of two unregistered revolvers
Used for circus purposes resulted in the
prosecution of George Anderson, manager
of Wirths’ Circus, in the Police Court
yesterday.
Defendant explained that the arms were
registered in Australia. He was unaware
of his responsibility to register them m
New Zealand. ' , ,
The Magistrate: You understand that
this regulation is necessary to keep such
arms out. of reach of undesirable people,
1 v;ill not impose a fine.
Defendant was convicted and dis-
charged. ___
ELEPHANTS ANI>
RAILWAYS
WORK OF CIRCUS
ANIMALS
OFFICIALS IMPRESSED
Railway officials in Christchurch
are deeply impressed with the capa-
bilities of the elephant as a source
of motive power. After watching
the elephants which helped to un-
load Wirth Brothers’ circus on its
arrival on Sunday afternoon they
made the animals their chief sub-
ject of conversation yesterday. Ona
official told a reporter of “The
Press” that he had heard that an
elephant could move trucks weigh-
ing 120 tons, which would be a
rake of about 10 fully loaded
wagons, and he explained that th *
was approximately the load which
could be moved by one of the trac-
tors equipped with railway wheels
that are used for shunting.
Another official had watched he
elephants adjusting the loaned
wagons. Many of the wagons, he
said, had been so fully loaded that
the most careful adjustment was
necessary to ensure that they would
pass safely through the tunnels on
the route between Greymouth and
Christchurch, and he said he had
been amazed by the delicate way
i in which the elephants moved the
loads a few inches at a time with
their trunks, obeying the commands
of their drivers with complete
understanding.
The circus trains trip from Grey-
mouth was not within incident. An
engine breakdown near Aratiki de-
layed it 5| hours. This was we-
sponsible for the late arrival at
Christchurch, which kept so many
young people on tenterhooks
throughout a long Sunday after-
noon. One official, also enthusias-
tic about the possibilities of ele-
phant power, regretted that it had
rot been possible to unload some of
the animals to take over the engine *
job at Aratiki.
Particularly was the Railway De-
partment impressed by the care
with which the huge beasts did
their work. They put their shoul-
ders against the wagons and with-
\ out any bumping or jerking, moved
! them away gently and delicately.
I It is safe to say that if the many
children who watched the circus
train arrive on Sunday were thrilled
by the spectacle, the officials who
handled the train were themselven
no less interested.
LION KILLS LIONESS
Fierce Battle in Circus
Cage
TRAINER RISKS HIS LIFE
(Received January 30, 5.5 p.m.)
New York, January 20.
A Cleveland message states that tvw>
circus lions fought a battle to the
death in their cage to-day just before
a public performance was scheduled to
start.
Clyde Beatty, noted animal trainer,
risked his life by entering the cage
armed with a revolver loaded with
blanks, but was unable to separate the
beasts.
“Sammy.” a huge male, attacked a
young lioness and gained a death grip
on her throat which held until she was

SHOT IN BACK BY
A MONKEY
CIRCUS ATTENDANT IS
WOUNDED
j Charles Alfred Broomhall, 23, a
Tasmanian, was shot in the back by
a monkey at Wirth’s Circust last
night, and taken to St. Vincent’s
Hospital.
The monkey, known as Tarzan,
was doing an act under the control
of Madam Prince when the accident
occurred. Tarzan had been fixed
in position on a chair, ready to shoot
at a sausage-shaped balloon placed
before a target, 15 yards away, A
.22 rifle was fixed to its swivel, and
Tarzan levelled it and fired.
The bullet missed its target,
ploughed its way through a piece of
one-inch Oregon placed in position to
stop stray bullets, passed through the
tent, and struck Broomhall, who was
outside performing his duties.
He was taken to St, Vincent’s Hos-
pital, where a wound in Ills back was
treated.
CIRCUS TRAGEDY
KILLED BY TENT POLE
Interference With Guy Rope
*
was due to injuries caused by the tent
through some person’s unwarranted
interference. if the police elucidate
the matter, some further steps will
have to be taken. As far as the evi-
dence is concerned, I can only hi ing
in a verdict that the deceased s death
was due to injuries cauesd by the tent
pole falling upon him by the guy rope
being unloosed by some person wit.i-
out authority.”
The foregoing remarks were made by
the Coroner, Mr. E. W, Turner, today,
when the inquest was resumed upon
Laurie Raymond (a son of the Sydney
“handcuff king”), who was killed at
Wirths’ Circus on Wednesday uigiu.
The case was conducted by Chief De-
tective-Inspector Oakes.
Dr. Rattan’s F
Victor R. flatten, suigeon superinten-
dent of the Public Hospb ~ stated that
’Raymond was brought to the hospital at
8,45 p.m. on December in a (lying condi-
tion. He died 25 minutes later. In his
opinion, death was due to hemorrhage
of the lungs mainly, and through frac-
ture of the base of the skull. A crush-
ing of the body would cause hemorrhage
of the lungs.
Statement by Tent Boss.
Sydney Rose, tent “boss” at Wirth s
Circus, stated that he knew Raymond,
who was a native of New Zealand and
had been with the circus since Easter,
1924. On Wednesday evening, about 8.20,
the witness was outside the menagerie
tent, which was being taken down. He
wag in charge. The tent was lowered and
Raynmod was unlacing one' section. The
witness heard a crash and saw the de-
ceased on the .ground under the main
pole of the tent. It was about 36 feet
long and struck him about 30 feet from
the bottom. Raymond was removed to
the hospital. The main pole had four
main guy ropes fastened to pegs, 3ft. 6in.
long, in the ground. The peg which held
the hope that came loose was bent over
and burred at the top. The witness ex-
amined this peg three or four minutes
before. Pie could not ascertain who had
undone the rope. The ~ A . man, Miles,
would have undone it when the time ar-
rived. Any one of the 300 or 400 people
standing round might have loosened the
rope.
Mr. Turner: There was no weight upon
the pole at the time?
The -witness: No; had there been any
weight it would have helped to keep the
pole up,
“Appeared to See It.”
Vaina Tamppinen, second tent man at
the circus, said that he was supervising
the packing up of the menagerie tent.
He examined the ropes and gave the order
to lower the canvas. The guy ropes were
secure before the canvas was lowered.
About two or three minutes later he
heard the call to stand clear. Turning,
he saw the pole falling, and saw it strike
the deceased. It appeared to strike him
across the back of the neck and shoul-
ders. The helped to lift the
pole off Ra; who at the time was
engaged in uniacmg a section of i »*-• -ent.
He was standing upright when the pole
fell on him. He appeared to see it, but
could not get away. The witness had
made enquiries, but could not locate any
person wbo had touched the guy rope.
At the time there were about 300 people
standing round. It was the practice
never to lower the pole until the canvas
had been rolled up. The witness always
lowered the pole himself.
How It Occurred.
Mr. Oakes: What is your opinion as
to how this occurred?
The witness: All the men working on
the tent were experienced; some un-
authorised person must have touched the
rope.
Mr. Oakes informed the Coroner that
when the accident happened there were
several plainclothes police present, and
although they made enquiries immediately
they w r ere unable to discover any person
who had interfered with the guy rope.
MAULED BY LION
BOY AT ORANGE
ARM PRAGGED IN CAGE
! SYDNEY, Friday.—While standing
a ear the wheel of a travelling cage of
; a circa..;, which was visiting Orange,
Patrick Burke (1-). had his arm drag-
, ged into the cage by a lioness, which
came from the Malay States 13 months
I ago.
His cries brought the keeper, who,
>fter a fier. e attack on the infuriated
beast, compelled her to release her hold.
Passengers from Bourke, who were at
the station, where the scene took place,
were horrified as the struggle proceeded.
Tt was found at the hospital tha the arm
had been terribly mauled and cut, but,
, it was hoped to save the limb.
CIRCUS DWARF’S FLA*".
MEDICAL OPINIONS CONFLICT.
Verdict for Wirth. Bros.
The hearing was concluded before Mr.
Justice Weigall, in the Banco Court yes-
terday, of on action in which Guiseppe
Bignoli, a dwarf, proceeded against Wirth
Bros. Pty. Ltd. for £lOO, and for the re-
turn fare of himself and his brother to
America. Bignoli pleads that he was en-
gaged to do a certain performance for
Wirth Bros, at £5O a week. Wirth Bros.,
under the agreement, retained £lOO, and
when he declined to renew the contract
the firm refused to pay over the money.
The firm also refused to pay the second-
class return fare of himself and his brother
to America. To this he was entitled under
the agreement. Mr. T. C. Brennan (in-
structed by Mr. Bateman) appeared for
Bignoli, and Mr. Gorman (instructed by
Messrs. W. B. and O. McCutcheon) for
Wirth Bros. Pty. Ltd. Bignoli claimed
that the /condition of his health precluded
him from renewing the contract for 12
months.
The defendant firm pleaded that, in view
of Bignoli’s failure to continue in the ser-
vice of the firm, he was. not entitled to
the £lOO or the return fare. By reason
of the failure the firm had been put to
considerable expense, and it counter-
claimed £450.
Dr. Thomas Murphy, of Collins street,
giving evidence for the plaintiff yesterday,
said;-—I find that not- only is Bignoli a
dwarf in size, but there is a defective
growth in the bones. His bones are also
deformed. Bignoli complained of pains j
after a performance. There is evidence
of strain of the muscles. He is now
suffering from some injury, and, in ad-
dition to his congenital defects, he seems
to be losing his nerve. Something seri-
ous might happen to him if he continued
to perform.
Dr. J. W. Springthorpe in evidence said: J
—On October 30 1 saw Bignoli performing
at Wirth’s circus. He went around with j
a horse and also went around i the ring i
without a horse. I saw no sign of in- j
efficiency. ' I considered the performance j
wonderful. Afterwards I had a conver-
sation with Bignoli, and I did not see any
sign of anxiety about him. He gave me
the impression that he did not suffer any
ill-effects. r xarnined Bigndli on the
following day. iie told me that he
was 32 years of age, and that his gene-
ral health had been .good. He added
I that he usually performed for seven months
in the year and rested for the rest of" <e
! time. Bignoli had pains in the back. As
I far As I could see he could have done
! another period of service after a rest.
George Anderson, general manager for
the company, said: —I have seen almost
I the whole of Bignoli’s performances, and
■ I have never seen any sign of inefficiency
about him. W’ r -spoke about renew-.
ing the i ignoli said, that he
could not go on for another year, because
his back “was bad and his foot and ankle
were “not too good.” I told him to
“take it easy,” and to cut out a turn or
two until he got better. Bignoli said that
he would see what the doctor said. He
added that if he got the full profits out
of the sale’ of post-cards it would make a
difference. I pointed out that that was.
not in accordance with the agreement.
Owing to the failure of Bignoli to enter
into, a further engagement 2,500 posters,
which cost £35 a 1.000, £l5 worth of
postage-cards, And other printed matter
are thrown on our hands.
Mr. Justice Weigall gave judgment -for
the defendant company on the claim, with
costs. He awarded the company £122:
damages on the counter-claim, with costs.
From the damages will be deducted £lOO,
held as forfeit.
COSTLY TRIBUTES TO
“JOHNNIE”
Amy Johnson will be worth £30,000 or
£ l 000 at least by the time she leaves
bj .ney, and, if all the glowing off ”
could be accepted, the total would
far more*
In addition to the £lO,OOO prize awar
ed to her by the London “Daily Mail,’
there is another equal amount for the
rights of her story ofher flight—£2o,ooo
to start her fast-swelling bank account.
Then there have been many other
cheques—one for £lOO given to her in
Queensland, another for the same sum
to be given her next week at the Theatre
Royal gala performance, and others, such
as the Lord Mayor’s Fund in Brisbane,
and the considerable sum which was her
reward for appearing at the Palais Royal
a few nights ago.
VALUABLE GIFTS
Then come the valuable gifts 1 with
which “Johnnie” has been showered —a
magnificent diamond and platinum wrist-
let watch, worth about 300 g is., from Tat-
tersall’s Club, and a diamond-studded
cardcase worth about 80gns. from City
Tattersall’s, a diamond and golden sap-
phire brooch from Mr. Percy Marks,
worth about 50gns.; another, lovely and
valuable, given her at the Women’s Citi-
zens’ Luncheon; an opal ring from the
Hull residents in Australia, and another
opal jewel, a pendant, from Angus and
Cootes: and many others.
Clothes, too; every garment from
slippers to rich fur coats! How they
have heaped her rooms everywhere
until even the austere ballroom at
Government House here resembled,
for a moment, a packing depot of a
department store.
Even a glorybox—a lovely thing worth
about 30gns., from Robt. Bear and Co.—
is included. Gramophone, tennis rac-
quet, hats and shoes and bags and every
possible wish —thev are all there.

Shot From Cannon
MISHAP AT CIRCUS
Shaking: Bruised Knee
NARRABRI, Friday.
A circus artist who appears under
the name of The Great Prybill, now
touring with Wirth’s Circus, met
with an accident while executing his
sensational act of being fired from
a cannon during a performance here
last night.
After being propelled from the gun
tfce performer, instead of landing in the
net provided to break his fall, hit a taut
rope on the edge of the net.
Attendants immediately carried the
man Irom the ring and it was subse-
quently announced that on hitting the
rope Prybill suffered a severe shaking,
and portion of one knee was bruised.
The act is acknowledged as being
very dangerous, and has cost many men
their lives.
A Night Off
’yyHAT will go down in history as the great
Centenary storm was responsible for the
breaking of many records. The wind and
rain, though it did not stop the performance
of the play of the same name last night, pre-
vented Wirths’ Circus from showing.
None of the performers or attendants
could remember any previous occasion when
the weather in Melbourne played such a trick,
though in the country, under canvas, the
circus has had to close its flapping doors.
Having the night off, an exceptional event,
most of the troupe sought the movies, the
theatres and the dance halls, though some
of the women, reluctant to “waste the holi-
day,” busied themselves with washing, iron-
ing and mending their wardrobes in prepara-
tion for the country tour which begins in a
fortnight.
Captain Eric Flyger and Mr Emil Payer,
the wild animal trainers, seized the oppor-
tunity, in the absence of spectators, of giv-
ing a lesson to a pair of young Bengal tigers.
A circus is not mere tinsel, but hard, bard
work.

Monkey Raid.
Walking along the station platform
yesterday making towards the Riverton
train was a happy family, obviously
out for a picnic on the beach. A little
boy, determined to be useful, brought
up the rear carrying in his bucket a
pound of tomatoes. Suddenly from a
tin fence nearby there swooped down
on the youngster a monkey which with
its mates had evidently strayed from
the circus headquarters. With a fright-
ened squeal the boy dropped his bur-
den and sought the protection of his
parents. Into the bucket went the
monkey’s paw and out came a tomato.
Immediately down climbed the other
monkeys to share in the loot; and
although they hurriedly scrambled on
to the top of the fence again at the
approach of a threatening father, each
had a tomato in its
Tribute to Cornetist
Sir, —-During the broadcast of the com-
munity concert recently I could not help
feeling a pang of regret as I sat and lis-
tened to that greatest of all cornetists,
Hugh McMahon. It was many years since
I had heard him play, having been absent
from this country, and although he must
now be a fair age, I have yet to hear his
equal.
It is pathetic to listen to some players
who are regarded as champions in their
own particular land, and how they manage
to have their efforts recorded amazes me,
but still they do. I have not heard a
single record of McMahon’s playing, and
it is hard to think that he cannot last for
ever. When the time comes for Hughie
to put his instrument aside perhaps lovers
of music will realise what they have lost.

RIDING EXHIBITION.
Sir. —I was one amongst the crowd
at the Exhibition who witnessed the
display of so-called riding by Russian
Cossacks. I heard a comment, “Our
riders are much better.” That was
true, but imagine how I felt hearing,
that, and loo' ing at the caricature /
riding of Cossacks.
Later I met one of those “Cossacks,” 1
and spoke to him in Russian. He did
not understand me, and on my ques-
tioning him, he said, “We are Aus-
tralians, but call ourselves Cossacks,
just for advertisement.”
As I am a constant reader of your.
paper, will you please publish this let- !
ter, for the public should know that
they had seen, not the riding of Rus-
sian Cossacks, but that of Australians.
—I am, sir, &c.,

MAN MAULED
BY LIONS
Terrible Scene At
Zoo
WENT AFTER HAT
(Courier-Mail Special Cable.)
LONDON, June 7.
An attempt by Stanley Stenson (26)
to help a friend earned him a ter-
rible death at the Whipsnade Zoo
to-day.
Stenson, who was a van driver, em-
ployed at the zoo, was driving a friend
named Myhill on a tour of inspection
when Myhill’s hat blew off and fell
into the lions’ enclosure. Stenson
climbed into the enclosure to retrieve
the hat. “Don’t be a fool; get a
keeper!” cried a bystander, as Stenson
started to climb the barrier. Sten-
son, however, took no notice, and,
watched by a circle of horrified spec-
tators, amid a breathless hush, crawled
along the interior of the railings to
a small iron palisade, near which was
the hat.
He attempted to reach it. whereupon
ie of four full-grown lions,’ Jock, Nero,
aoe, and Prince, which were baskirm
in the sunshine, sprang up, and seized
Stenson’s hand. A second lion then
dashed up, and buried its teeth in
Stenson’s arm. Myhill, followed by
other men, tried to free the victim
but the lions, infuriated by the smell
of blood, maintained their grip. One
dragged Stenson’s boot off, and then
wrenched him from the hands of the
would-be rescuers as a cat snatches
a mouse.
FELL 17 FEET.
He fell 17 feet head first to the con-
crete floor of the pit, and lay ap-
parently stunned, or possibly with a
fractured skull. The lions dragged
him some feet, and began mauling
him as keepers, summoned by whistles,
rushed to the scene. They kept the
two remaining lions at bay with poles,
but were compelled to fire revolvers
before the others were driven off.
The spectators, among whom were
fainting and screaming women,
watched the keepers compel the snarl-
ing beasts to retreat to their cages,
where they were locked up.
Stensons body was removed for an
inquest. A doctor examined it, but is
not certain whether death was due
to a fractured skull or whether the i
lions finally killed him.
It was Stenson’s last day of duty;
he was to take up another job to-
morrow'. *
SEVERE GALE
WIDE AREA AFFECTED.
62-Miles-an-Hour Wind.
The terrific wind and rain storm which
struck Perth at about 11 o’clock on Wed-
nesday night continued throughout the
night and although it had abated consider-
ably yesterday morning, severe gusts con-
tinued to be experienced through the
day. The worst squall, which was res-
ponsible for the wrecking of the main tent
of Wirth Brothers’ circus, causing dam-
age estimated at over £GOO, occurred
shortly before 11 o’clock on Wednesday
night. The wind at this period travelled
at 62 miles an hour, while several other
times during the night gusts of up to 50
miles an hour were experienced. The
gale travelled through the country dis-
tricts and was especially severe along the
south coast where it was still blowing at
almost hurricane force yesterday morn-
ing.
Apart from the damage done to Wirths’
circus tent, there was surprisingly little
toll taken by - the storm in the metropoli-
tan area. In two cases houses were
damaged, an outbuilding at the Karra-
katta railway station was blown down
and some country telephone lines were
out of order. Otherwise the principal
effect was the wrecking of gardens and
the breaking of limbs from trees. The
sea front and pier at Cottesloe escaped
unharmed. The wind did not bank up
the Swan River, which did not rise to
any appreciable extent.
What had previously been the main
tent of Wirth Brothers’ circus was yes-
terday morning a mass of torn canvas.
The entire tent, which was valued at over
£6OO and which, it was stated, was not
insured, was torn to shreds and will be
of no further use. The menagerie tent,
blown down in the storm, escaped with
a few tears and yesterday morning men
were busily mending it. No performance
was given last night and the spare tent
which is always carried with the circus
will be erected in time for the matinee
performance this afternoon.

Tigers In
Back Yard
By a Correspondent
If Emil Payer can train a pair of
two-year-old Bengal tigers and
have them ready to go through a
series of tricks in the performing i
| ring during Easter, when Wirths’ circus,,
i plays its Sydney season, he will win aii
i £lOO side wager. r
1 Emil Payer has made this wager with
'the proprietors of Wirths’ circus. Payer
is no more anxious to win the £lOO.
j than are the proprietors of Wirths’ to!
| lose it, for they require this tiger-act j
i to complete their show.
; There may be many people who can
remember a tiger-act at Wirths’. but it
' is more than 25 yeai's since trained tigers
j have appeared on the circus programme.
Still Has Power
l During those years Emil Payer has!
been away from the circus, and has not
! had anything to do with tire training!
!of animals. But he is confident that
he still possesses the power to compel
j the tigers to do as he bids.
; For the last three weeks. Emil has
, been the two Bengals’ constant com-1
! panion.
He first approached them by poking |
| small squares of raw meat on a long j
pointed stick through the bars of their j
| cage. |
1 Slowly they began to recognise him. 1
and eventually they were taking the;
i meat gently from the finger tips.
Now. after a meal, or if in a par- j
! ticularly playful mood, they allow him j
to roll them over and treat them as;
though they were ordinary household
pets.
Takes No Risks
But Emil Payer does not take any un-
; due risks with them.
“As with all animals of the cat species,!
you never kno wwhen you’ve got them,” 1
I he says.
Emil Payer conforms strictly to the;
rules of Wirths’ Circus, which forbid any >
i act of cruelty in the training of animals.!
| While actually training. Payer carries!
:a unique v' ip made from the sinew of
a rhinocerc *'is is very flexible, and
| tapers down to « fine point. By bend- 1
| ing it over and holding both ends in his
band, sufficient pressure can be applied
to the tigers to gently force them into i
1 the position he wants. Rarely does he
i give them even a slight cut with the!
whip. Perseverance and patience are
more effective, he believes.
Payer, while working with the animals, j
wears sand shoes, shorts and singlet.
High boots, leather suit and thick gloves
do not appeal to him.
Scars From Teeth And Claws
He believes that if a savage beast gets
out of control a suit of armor would l
not prevent injury. But, careful as
Payer has been, scars from claws and
teeth on his arms, legs and body are
proof that he has come off second best
on several occasions.
During the latter stages of training,
he substitutes the uniform worn in the
ring for his singlet and shorts.
But Payer himself does not appear in
the ring. He trains the animals and
they are then taken over by Captain Eric
Flyger. Few will envy either man his I
job.
In a few days the circus will begin
its country tour, which has been delayed
by the floods. It will leave behind
Payer and the two Bengals.
One of the outer suburbs has been j
selected by Payer as his training centre. 1
Here he has obtained permission from
the local council to keep his “pets’ ’ aflirft
the plans of the cages and general safety!
arrangements had been approved.

EXACTLY 20 YEARS OLD
BORN AT NGARUAWAHIA
[by telegraph—OWN correspondent]
PUKEROHE, Monday
On the arrival of the Wirths’ circus
train at Pukekohe from Ngaruawahia
to-day, one of the performing lionesses,
Queenie, was found dead in her cage.
Queenie was a New Zealander, one
of a litter of six born when the circus
was at Ngaruawahia on St. Patrick’s
Day, 1914.
The animal’s age was thus 20 years
and one day, and her life ended almost
in the same locality where it began.
Of late, Queenie appeared to be
fretting after her cage mate, Maud,
another member of the litter of 20
years ago. Maud died in Dunedin at
Christmas.
Of the litter of six, only two lion-
esses are now surviving, and these two
were reared away from their mother.
A bulldog obtained in Auckland was
foster-mother to the two cubs, which
have remained with the circus ever
since.

This is the Maoris* team, which met
the Springboks. We are indebted to
Mr. J. R. Henderson for the picture,
which is a very fine one. In the centre
is Mr. W. T. Parata, so well known in
Australia for his enthusiasm in Rugby,
especially among the Maoris, an enthus-
iasm ever being shown in a practical way.
The Maoris made a fine showing
against the Springboks, who defeated
them by 9 to 8. The advantage of com-
bination was with the South Africans,
who had played so many matches to-
gether, whereas the Maoris had had little
match practice as a team. We in Australia
have a very high appreciation of the,
Maori footballers. We did not see the
famous band of 1888 without forming a
very high estimate of their football
powers. We know, too, that Billy War-
brick and Tom Ellison were Maoris
whose influence on Australian football was
elevating. Both men showed our players
how to do things in a very able way.
Warbrick as leader and tactician in
Queensland, and later in Sydney, and
Ellison as a wing forward of science
and strength. Well, the Maoris of to-
day are of the same type, and when they
determine to come this way again to play
the old brand of Rugby, they will find the
welcome as hearty as ever.

All Blacks Beat Springboks
At Dunedin by 13 to 5
Giant Forwards’ Grim Straggle :
Dogged Defence by Both Teams’
H~ (By Cable, from The Referee Special.)
The first Test match between the All Blacks, as representing New Zealand, and
the Springboks, as representing South Africa, is over. And the men of the Silver
Fern have triumphed. '
But it was a tense and bitter fight between giant forward divisions, the South
Africans averaging 14st 81b, and the New Zealanders about a stone less.
The South Africans established a lead of 5 points in the first half. But the
home team, playing with desperate energy and strength, put on 13 points to nil
after changing ends.
The Springboks, nevertheless, were not done with. Their big forwards fairly
hummed into the enemy, and, penning them, close to the goal-line, continued an
attack that, to sections of an excited crowd, seemed to last half an hour, though
really only about five minutes.
The New Zealanders, facing the heavier men, tired a bit under the stress of a
relentless struggle. But, fortunately for them, the big Springboks, being human
Jike themselves, tired too, and at the finish victory went to the better side.
The teams left the field holding one another in the highest possible respect.
BIG CROWD AND PERFECT WEATHER.
interest was tmprecedented for a Rugby game in Dunedin. The atten-
dance was 27,000, and the teams and all concerned were delighted with the perfect
weather.
In the opening stages the visitors had the home team on the defensive, owing
to their great pace—greater than anything shown in the matches with the provinces
—?and splendid kicking. A low sun was disadvantageous to New Zealand, who
had it shining in their eyes.
The big South African forwards were in perfect condition, and, pushing in the
pack like one man, had the power of a steam engine. Though the Blacks were
also men of striking physique, South Africa carried scrum after scrum, and this,
together with solid attacks by their backs, produced a wonderfully fast game, with
■South Africa ever aggressive, though their attacking combination was somewhat
deficient at times. This was probably due to the splendid tackling of the New
Zealand forwards, who, playing the traditional game of the All Blacks, were like
backs in the loose and open and demons in the tackle.
SPRINGBOK BACKS IN ACTION.
The South African machine improved after a while, and in some fine passing
rushes they left the home backs standing. The game was very tense, with the
New Zealanders at full stretch, game and glorious, and the South Africans the same,
with the confidence that so many matches together always generates. Just on half-
time a South African forward picked up at the edge of a scrum, and, swinging to
the blind side, passed to van Heerden, who forced his way over and scored first
try of the game, which G. P. Morkel converted. South Africa 5-0 at half-time. It
bad been a slashing battle, with the tackling beating the attack.
ALL BLACKS CHANGE THEIR TACTICS.
After the spell the New Zealanders introduced the high punt for the follow-up
by the forwards. This tested the South African backs, but their fielding was ex-
cellent, and they did not flinch. However, the Blacks scored their first try
through one of these punts. The ball landed over the line between three Africans,
but bounced back to Beilis, who touched down. M. Nicholls converted. It
was considered a lucky score, but as it is a typical New Zealand method of attack
it should not be depreciated.
__ The game now slowed down perceptibly, and for some time short rushes by
felther side were the only incidents.
STEELE’S BRILLIANCY.
1 However, the lull was only temporary.
It preceded the greatest spectacle of the
imatch. In midfield a short kick by A.
South, African back, was splendidly
fielded by Steele, the N.Z. wing three-
quarter, who threw off a tackle, and
then forged ahead for gioal with a big
sprint. He ran right round half-back
Michau and Morkel, the full-back, and
scored between the posts. M. Nicholls
Again goaled. New Zealand 10-5. This
success created unbounded enthusiasm,
for the South African’s seriousness and
solidity had impressed the crowd with
the fact that they were very valiant an-
tagonists.
SPRINGBOKS MAKE SUPREME EFFORT.
The South Africans, stung by this
change in the positions of the scores,
made the pace a cracker, backs and for-
wards rising to it in a supreme effort.
..The forwards surpassed themselves, with
the backs eager and active, and with
powerful attacks on either wing penned
New Zealand near their line. A des-
perate forward battle in this area lasted
for several minutes, till ‘a penalty gave
Morkel a shot at goal, which was fruit-
less. New Zealand forced down, thus
relieving the pressure. The defence of
the home team in this period was ex-
ceptionally determined and skilful, with
the forwards absolutely at their stretch.
By this time the New Zealand for-'
wards were showing the effect of their
bouts with the heavy Springbok pack,
and for a time seemed to be falling
away. . The Africans next came with
two stinging attacks. In.one van Heer-
den beat two men and then, with this
try looming ahead, he passed wildly to
Clarkson, and it helped the defence to
end the advance. The South Africans
were fighting it out with rare gameness.
BLACKS SCORE A THIRD TRY,
However, the New Zealanders having
the lead, were playing a safe game, and
• : -LL-‘—
using the touch line with excellent judg-
ment.
Towards the end the South African
forwards were no less done than the
home pack, for big as they are, and mag-
nificent as their condition was, they were
up against a pack worthy of the jerseys
they wore.
The Springboks towards the end fell
back a bit, and a series of New Zealand
forward rushes culminated in Storey,
the three-quarter back, being given the
ball, and he got over in the corner.
Nicholls missed goaL New Zealand thus
won by 13 points (3 tries and two goals)
to 5 (a try and a goal).
THE GAME’S FEATURES SUMMARISED.
The New Zealanders deserved the win.
The South Africans played their very
best team. The keynote of the igame
was the sterling defence. It wa s a clean,
open game, with deadly tackling on both
sides. The pace was not particularly fast
on the whole, though here and there it
was. New Zealand’s tenacity and bull-
dog courage won the victory for them.
The last thirty minutes of play was
tremendously exciting. After Steele’s
try, with the score 10 to 5 in New Zea-
land’s favor, it seemed as though noth-
ing could withstand the Black’s on-
slaught. The South Africans hung on
with grim determination, but had to give
way to superior stamina and skill.
The South Africans lacked finesse in
movement by the backs. The centre three-
quarters lacked thrust and penetration.
New Zealand’s victory was largely one
of the forwards’ physical condition and
tenacity, though two of the three tries
were scored by the backs.
The overwhelming play of the New
Zealand forwards and the points ma-
jority in the scores, allayed the South
Africans’ soreness over the try awarded
to BelHs, which they had questioned.
The game was very friendly, with the
spectators most impartial.

PE-FEREE COMMENT/ 1
THE ALL BLACKS GET FIRST LEG-IN
“And the stern joy which warriors feel
In foemen worthy of their steel.”
The special correspondent of the Referee elsewhere spins his cabled story
of the grim struggle for victory between the Rugby Union stalwarts of New Zealand
and South Africa on the Carisbrook Ground at Dunedin on Saturday, It was a
veritable battle of giants.
Ever since the All Blacks made history in the Old Country, by the manner
in which they whipped the greatest fifteens, and, incidentally, expounded fresh
fascinations in Rugby Union football, they have appeared to Australians and New
Zealanders as champions of the Rugby Union world.
But the South Africans, following immediately on the All Blacks’ trail, re-
peated history at the expense of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. A second
Springbok team over the same ground attained similar results, thus demonstrating,
beyond question that the Colonials of Africa and of the southern seas were rivals
for the Rugby Union honors of the world.
Possibly Australia, whose Wallabies had also made a wonderful name again3t
what may be considered awakened British football forces, would now be in line
with New Zealand and South Africa as aspirants for the world’s championship but
for the cleavage in the Rugby forces in Sydney, which has left the main strength
with the Rugby League. To-day Australians have to be content with The Ashes
of Northern Union Rugby, which, great in its way, is wanting in the universal re-
nown of its amateur parent.
®®®® ® ® ® ®
The war deferred the first trial of strength between South Africa and New
Zealand. But the war assisted as, perhaps, nothing else might have done, to bring
the South Africans to the Dominions of the South. The Imperial Services tourna-
ment, in which New Zealand won the King’s Cup, paved the way for a tour through
South Africa by the successful soldier boys of N.Z. And that eminently successful
tour, measured from any and every stand-'
point, led to this visit by the South Afri-
cans to Australia and New Zealand. The
South Africans were seriously hit in their
football strength by the war. But New
Zealand find Australia were hard hit, too.
Did not David Gallaher, the captain of
the All Backs, fall fighting in France?
SPRINGBOKS PREPARED FOR THE DAY.
The South African team enjoyed the
advantage of a preliminary programme
in Sydney, during which they had ample
chances of getting to know one another’s
play and to evolve those team-tactics
which mean so much in match winning
against high-class opponents. Having
gone through the Sydney programme un-
beaten, they shipped off to New Zealand
a quiet, determined lot of men, imbued
with a feeling that the serious play, or
work, of the tour was about to begin.
® ® ® ®
Without showing all their goods to the
enemy, they went in against the provin-
cial teams, winning most of the matches,
losing one to Canterbury, and drawing
another with Taranaki. They then had
a few days to put on the finishing
torches for the first Test match, at Caris-
brook Ground, Dunedin, on Saturday.
Though the New Zealanders had
chosen their fifteen some weeks before
the match, and the men were got to-
gether under coach William Stead, of the
All Blacks, the team were under one im-
portant disadvantage in having had no
match practice to develop their combina-
tion, or to weld them into a machine
such as that of the original All Blacks.
© ® ® ©
However, throughout New Zealand
confidence was felt in the home team,
even though there was a feeling that
the Springboks had subordinated every
other consideration with a view to being
able to go on to the field in this, the
greatest of all their engagements, in fit-
ting fighting trim, and with the con-
fidence that fathers success when all
things else are as they should be.
The contest appears to have been a
fitting realisation of what Rugby Union
enthusiasts expend. It was such a
struggle, with so little between the two
teams, that the next 'Test match will pro-
bably be even greater in every sense,
viewed either from the standpoint of
football skill or that of public interest
and expectation.
N.S. WALES DEFEATS N. ZEALAND
BY 17 POINTS TO NIL : DOMINION RUGGER GONE BACK
-1921
(By Cable to The Referee)
AUCKLAND, Saturday.—The Test
match between New South Wales and
New Zealand under Rugby Union rules
was played at Christchurch to-day in
glorious weather, with the ground hard
and fast. There was an enormous at-
tendance, the unbeaten record of the
team from Sydney having worked up
public interest.
NEW ZEALAND.—C. E. Evans, full-
back ; W. A. Ford, S. Ryan, F. G. Ward
Markham, three-quarters ; Algar and
Roberts, five-eighths ; Shearer, halt-back;
Carroll, Peterson, Fletcher, White, Cum-
mings, Brownlee, Cabot (injured and re-
placed by Turnbull).
N.S. WALES. —Nothling, full-back ;
Wallace, Wogan, Stanley, and Raymond,
three-quarters ; Humphreys, five-eighth;
Walker, half-back ; Davis, Bond, Smith,
Fox, Elliott, Dunn, Loudon, and Thorn,
forwards.
The home forwards early got through
the Blue defence, and a force resulted.
Then N.S. Wales attacked strongly,
Evans saving by marking. Keeping up
the attack, N.S. Wales figured in a fine
passing rush, and Stanley crossed the
goal-line, but the referee disallowed the
try.
New Zealand worked play down to the
25, but a free saved N.S. Wales, who were
later awarded a free-kick, from which
Loudon kicked a goal. N.S. Wales 3
to nil.
Soon after the kick-off a fine passing
rush by New Zealand carried play right
on to the goal-line, but a penalty relieved
the visitors. New Zealand kept up the
pressure for a time. Roberts had a
try at goal from a free, which missed.
Good work by N.S.W. forwards re-
turned game to home territory, but the
Black forwards soon forced it back again,
till a penalty brought relief. N.S. Wales
came again with a fine passing rush,
which ended in a force down by New
Zealand.
Immediately afterwards Raymond com-
pleted another passing rush with a great
try, which Loudon failed to convert.
New Zealand quickened up and at-
tacked. Then a penalty shot at goal by
Roberts missed. The New South Wales
defence was thoroughly tested by a solid
passing rush, which the Blues stopped.
The spell ended with New Zealand at-
tacking and the visitors leading 6 to nil.
HALF-TIME—N.S. WALES 6 TO NIL.
New South Wales opened up the second
spell with a strong attack, but a forward
pass spoiled the effort. Here Cabot re-
tired injured, and was replaced by Turn-
bull.
The visitors came again, and were only
stopped by sound tackling. New Zea-
land worked back to half-way, where
the fiery forward Davis started a move-
ment in reply which gave Carr a try
after a good run. Loudon converted.
N.S. Wales 11 to nil.
By this time the crowd had been
thoroughly surprised by the superiority
of the New South Wales team, whose
pace and combination were superior to
that of the Blacks.
A knock-on spoiled a promising N.Z.
movement. Then Carr secured the ball and
kicked over the heads of the opposing
backs. In gathering up again he knocked
on close to goal. From the resulting
scrum Walker, the half-back, secured and
got over the line. This try was uncon-
verted. N.S. Wales 14 to nil.
The visitors continued to attack, and
in a few minutes another try was regis-
tered by Smith, but it was unconverted.
N.S. Wales 17 to nil.
BLUES SMART METHODS.
By this time the New Zealanders were
a defeated team, and N.S. Wales domi-
nated the play, some of their passing
being very pretty. New Zealand at-
tacked, but met with solid defence.
The crowd carried the visitors off the
field amidst great enthusiasm.
New Zealand’s showing was con-
sidered to be not worthy of ordinary
grade football. The most notable
weaknesses were shocking tackling, bad
passing and inability to handle the ball.
New .South Wales threw the ball any-
where and everywhere. They made many I
mistakes, but took all the risks, and came
out easy winners. The game was fast
from start to finish, but there were too
many blunders on both sides.
Nothling played a great game at full-
back. Long line kicks and sure handling
were features of his play.
Walker (half-back) was excellent.
Raymond and Wallace both showed
plenty of speed. Wogan and Stanley
were also good, backing up well. Of
the forwards Loudon, who is a great
kick, was about best. Davis and Fox j
were fast and tireless in the loose. The i
whole pack, however, played very ably.
NO EXCUSE OFFERED.
No excuse can be made for New Zea-
land’s defeat. They were beaten on their
merits. New South Wales played better
football, and it would require a very
good team to have beaten them on the
day. They proved a smart, nippy team,
with some very fast and capable backs.
Interviewed after the match, the cap-
tain (Walker) said he was delighted. It
was a good game, and the result would
help the Rugby Union game along in
Australia. j
E. Roberts, captain of the New Zea-
landers, said the visitors had the better
of it in all departments. ‘‘We had no
combination,” he added, ‘‘there was some-
thing wrong with our fellows both back
and forwardk”


N. Zealand v. South Africa
Why Springboks IVon Second Test
Winners’ Better Side :: New Zealand
Below Old Standard :: Record Crowd
(By The Referee Special.)
Aurld^nrf CS j g:am A e ’ ew Zealand v South Africa, was played on Eden Park,
a clear 00 . a * urday ’ August 27, on one of Auckland’s best days—a bright sun,
in W ‘u f light easterly breeze. The ground was hard and fast, more
I ° W ,J . their , home grounds, so that it was anticipated that the South
fnl nne * W °* T , tke * r ' 3est exhibition of the tour. The crowd was a wonder-
N 7 ° r ew Zeala nd, Eden Park being a mass of humanity, eager to see the
k 3 3 j tean ?’ at the same time willing to praise anything that was worth
4n non ein ®“. °” e t^e South Africans. It is estimated that there were up to
40,000 pe °plc, the gate takings amounting to nearly £4OOO.
The teams took the field amidst wonderful cheering, with a moving picture
mac me grin ing out his tune, while an army of photographers chased them on to
e green. The New Zealanders kicked off with a light wind, and started off with
an impression that they were going to win out easily. But the game fell a long
W ? y s 01 * ° b est International standard. The teams were evenly matched,
with the South Africans the stronger in the scrummage and on the line-out, though
not to any appreciable extent, and the game as a spectacle did not soar very
ifk ■ WaS keCn 3nd hardly fou e ht ’ with the New Zealanders striving hard
a 1 the time to turn the tide that had set in against them, and not succeeding well,
the way I viewed things. My conclusion is that on the run of the play the South
Africans should have won by at least five more points than they did.
I am inclined to place an International team of Rugby footballers on a very
lgh st a nd a rd, but cannot help asserting that neither the present South Africans
nor New Zealanders can be classed as a great International team. This thought
was forced home on me while the first Test match was in progress in Dunedin,,
and it was added to on Eden Park on Saturday afternoon.
NEITHER A GREAT RUGBY COMBINATION,
The conditions were favorable to an exhibition of the highest standard, yet
the fine features of Rugby football were few and far between. As a matter of
fact, they can be summed up in a sentence or two, and by enumerating three in-
cidents.
The first was the try scored by Sendin for the South Africans. Meyer, who
was playing fly half for the seconds time in his career as a footballer, made a fine
straight run up the centre of the field, and when accounted for the ball went
begging for a shade of time. Then Van Rooyen picked it up and the South
African backs swung along in fine style. Michau, Clarkson, and Sendin all
made nice little runs and their passes at the right time, the last-named slipping
over the goal-line to the salvos of applause from the crowd. It was a grand
movement, well carried out and finished off.
The second was a great run by Zeller down the side of the field opposite the
grandstand. He broke clean away from his supports and everybody else, and it
looked all Lombard-street to an orange that he would score the try. Just as
the people rose in their seats to cheer him, Roberts had run into position* and
with a beautiful tackle stopped Zeller’s progress and the try at the same time.
The tackle was such a solid one that Zeller was bereft even of initiative for the
time being as he was lying on the ground but six inches short of the goal-line,
and had only to lift the ball up to put it over and score the try. But while Zeller
and Roberts were on the ground, Badeley came along and quietly picked the ball as
| it was lying in the crook of Zeller’s arm,
I and, putting in a short run into touch
and safety.
MORKEL’S GREAT GOAL.
The third inedent was the potted goal
by Gerhard Morkel, the South African
full-back. A hard kick by a Springbok
forward was stopped by Kingstone, and
as he started to make his run before
kicking the ball, he slipped, and two
South Africans were on him before he
could recover himself. For a second or
two the ball lay quietly, and then it
started moving towards the New Zealand
goal. The players were converging on
the ball from all quarters, and Steel,
for safety’s sake, gave It a boost that
sent it to the dead ball line. The scrum-
mage ordered for the West Coaster’s
act was carried by the New Zealanders,
and the ball dribbled out to Morkel, the
visitors’ full-back. He was between the
25 and half-way lines, close to the touch-
line, when he got the ball, and running in-
field a few steps, he let go with the right
foot, the ball sailing fairly and squarely
between the goal-posts, and high up over
the centre. It was unexpected, but was
nevertheless a fine exhibition of how I
points can be scored if the man behind
the ball has a hefty ana well-directed
boot.
THE BLACKS’ TRY.
The incident that led up to New Zea- j
land’s try was not of the standard of the
three mentioned, but it Is worth draw-
ing attenton to here. The New Zealand !
backs had moved well together in uni-
son, but Meyer sent them back with a
good kick, which Kingstone equalised
when his chance came to return it. Then
from a scrummage Roberts went away
on the blind side. His pass to Storey
| was well made, the Timaru man getting
up a full head of steam. After he was
accounted for, and another player on
each side had handled the ball, it lay
on thq ground dangerously near the
South African line. McLean, Bay of
Plenty’s representative, grabbed it, and
with a dive worthy of a swimmer, shot
over the chalk-mark. Nicholl’s attempt to
convert the try is also worth writing !
about. As the ball left his boot it sailed j
true for the far goal-post, striking it on;
"theTnside, and rebounding over the cross-
KEPT IT TOO CLOSE.
These incidents were the only point-
getting ones during the match, which
thus ended in a victoey for South Africa
by 9 points to 5. The game opened
brightly from the New Zealand stand-
point. They carried the first scrummage,
and then the backs got going with short,
quick passes that looked full of promise.
But as the game wore on, this promise f
was not fulfilled except in a few rarer
instances than those mentioned. The
South Africans invariably used the
touch-line until they got into an attack-
ing positon, but did not open the game
up «s sufficently as they should have
done considering that they had slightly
the better of the New Zealanders both
on the line-out and in the heavy scrum-
mages. In consequence, the game began
to drag, and lose much of its specta-
jcular brightness.
SECOND HALF IN TABLOID.
In the second half Zeller’s run and
Morkel’s goal were the outstanding fea- 1
tures. Steel had one glorious opportunity.
He shook off a tackier splendidly, but
before he recovered from his stumble
he crashed into another man—-H. Morkel
—who accounted for h;m. He was at-
tended by Aitken and Roberts, and if
he had shot the ball' infield before meet-
ing his second tackier anything might
have happened. A fine forward attack
by New Zealand, with Moffitt in front, ;
looked like a try, but Beilis got off-
side just when the chalk-line came into
view. Roberts had a pot at goal that
went low, and Nicholls struck the post
with a kick from a mark. A swinging
South African forward movement was
spoilt by Boy Morkel kicking too hard
just when it was becoming dangerous.
And these sum up all the things really
worth noting—the others were hard slog-
ging amongst the forwards, good line-
kicking by the South Africans, and weak
ditto by the New Zealanders, with some
flashes of individual play, andl very
little of combination.

Where the South Africans fall from
grace as far as their standing as an
International side is concerned, is that
they play a strictly orthodox game. It
develops along lines that were common
to the playing of Rugby football any-
thing from 30 to 20 years ago in New
Zealand, and they rarely give one the
impression that anything out of the ordi-
nary is going to happen. They seem
to be obsessed with the idea that the
only players who should score tries are
the outside wing three-quarters, forget-
ting for the time being that every man
in a Rugby 15 is part and parcel of a
scoring combination, and should be given
the opportunity of putting a score oppo-
site his name if the chance comes his
way.
ALL BLACKS HAVE DETERIORATED.
“Biit they beat the New Zealanders,
and that is all they wanted to do.” This
remark, if made, would be perfectly in
order, but there is no gainsaying the fact
that the present New Zealand team is
a long way below the standard I have
been wont to rank a Dominion repre-
sentative side. If the team has been
well selected —which is a matter of much
South Africans have caught
New Zealand in a lean year. A change
has got to be made in the team for the
third Test game. Where it wants
strengthening is on the centre five-
eighths and centre three-quarter. The
defence admits of no cavil, but in my
opinion attack is ever the best defence
at Rugby football, and it is in this fea-
ture that the New Zealand team is weak.
THE BEST PLAYERS.
After the match was over the selec-
tors declared that G. Morkel. the South
African full-back, was entitled to the
gold medal as the best back in the game.;
And it was a good finding. He came to
New Zealand with a great reputation
with previous South African teams, and
he played right up to a high standard
on this occasion. His fielding was
faulty on two occasions, but his line-
kicking was as good as it was possible
to be. He was not asked to do much
cellaring or rust-supping—th J £*l ew
landers were altogether too slow in fol-
lowing up—and capped his performance
with a wonderfully good potted goal.
The three-quarters amongst the South
Africans were an even set, with Zeller
as the most versatile, although inclined
to run across the face of his opponents
more than he should have done. Sendin
was quick and nippy, but failed to take
some of his passes cleanly. Clarkson was
the solid man in the three-quarter line,
and Henry Morkel was the least notice-
able. , , ,
I liked Meyer at half, as he showed
an inclination to run straight through at
times. Maybe he was playing to in-
structions, as I thought he could have
run many times when he satisfied him-
self with kicking. Michau was not as
prominent as the fly half, but he did
not go into the scrummage after the
ball as often as I noticed him do on
previous occasions.
The South African forwards were satis-
fying alike on the line-out, in the heavy
stuff, and in getting on to the New
Zealand backs. Van Rooyen and Ellis
were the best of these Springboks, al-
though one and all gave a good exhibi-
tion.
On the New Zealand side Kingstone
was in good form at full-back, getting
to the ball and taking it on the fly in a
way that pleased me a lot. He had bad
luck once in slipping down just when he
was getting into his stride to clear. His
display was a long way in front of that
given by him in Dunedin in the first
Test match.
Steel and Storey did not have too
much to do \in attack, the ball only
filtering out to them on occasions. In
defence they were both very sound.
A;tker> Centre 1 -W-i 1
Nicholls and Badeley (five-eighth) aid
not impress me greatly in aggressive
movements, although no fault could pc
found with the way they worked in
keeping the opposition from getting
through. ,
Roberts, at half, passed out well and
made some fine runs. He was undoubted-
ly the strong man in the backs on the
New Zealand side, and played right up
to his reputation.
Donald was in the limelight on the
side of the scrummage right through the
piece and kept, on the ball persistently.
The New Zealand forwards seem to have
forgotten, judging by this game, that an
essential in their work is the following
through of kicks by their backs, and
generally seemed to me to be yards
slower than I anticipated. The selectors
decided that Beilis was the best forward
in the game, but I do not feel inclined
to agree with the pronouncement. In
my opinion the honor belonged to Ellis,
and that Moffitt was the best on the
New Zealand side. He worked hard and
consistently all the way through; Beilis,
McLean and Richardson were the best
of the others.
The third Test match is to be played
at the Athletic Park, Wellington, on Sep-
tember 17. There are likely to be
radical changes in the New Zealanc
team, and it seems to me that if they are
to succeed —the contract now seems a
steep one, with each team the winner
of a match—different methods will have
to be adopted in regard to the housing
and the' training of the men, for with-
out a doubt it was the New Zealand
team that was looking for the bell to
ring on Saturday afternoon, and not the
South Africans. The Springboks were
| in much the better fettle.
IMPRESSIONS OF SECOND TEST
OLD NEW ZEALAND REPRESENTATIVE'S TABLOID
OF MATCH SPRINGBOKS WON
A New Zealand representative player
of standing writes me from Auckland :
Dear Cynic,—lt is of the second
Test that I would tell you in this, my
v first modest attempt as a critic of Rugby,
the grand old game which is the
national religion. Mr. Bennett , the
manager of the Springboks, was right
when he said the other day that foot-
ball was an obsession with New Zea-
landers, but I never realised the truth
of it until the far-famed Springboks
came north to spreadeagle Auckland in a
contest where they raked our representa-
tives fore and aft.
Auckland’s fame as a. Rugby province
has suffered somewhat of an eclipse
these last few years, but a decade or more
ago Pienaar’s team would have found
tougher nuts to crack in the northern
city, to which asseveration A. F. Harding,
of Wales, could bear eloquent testi-
mony. But defeat could not dull the keen
edge of the public for the second Test,
because on the result of it seemed to
hang for N.Z. the Rugby championship
of the world, and for South Africa the
hope of the third and deciding battle.
ENTHUSIASM.
And so in their thousands they came—
by boat, by train, by motor, on foot
—any way, so long as they could get
there: men from the gum-fields of the
winterless North, from the bush-camps
of the King Country, from every little
village and hamlet where Rugby is wor-
shipped with a frenzy that brooks no
argument. For if you were bold enough
to say that an All Black team could suf-
fer defeat on its own soil, believe me,
you would be inviting the direct trouble.
Your New Zealander would reach out for
something to throw at you, and then,
with a fierce vehemence, flash his cheque-
book in your face. And the girls are
every bit as bad—bless ’em.
So now you know why Gerhard Mer-
kel’s wonderful drop-kick was looked
upon almost as a national calamity,
bringing home to us the dreadful possi-
bility that when the chosen 15’s again
face each other at Wellington on the
17th of September, the laurels that we
think are ours may be wrenched from
our grasp.
A PERFECT DAY.
The gods were kind to us with the
weather. A lovelier day in early spring
has never smiled on fair Auckland, and its
beautiful surroundings — a warm sun
from a cloudless sky. beneath which was
scarce enough breeze to flutter the tiny
flags of the rival countries, which depen-
ded from either goalpost. There have
been few more impressive moments in
the history of a great pastime than
when the chosen of N.Z. filed out behind
Captain George Aitken, to be greeted by
a tumultuous roar from 35,000 throats,
and followed immediately by a deafening
applause as the Springboks faced them
for a preliminary cheer.
FLAWLESS DEFENCE.
Play began at a great pace. Africa
kicked oft with a strong sun behind them,
and N.Z. lined well. Then from the
line-out a hot N.Z. rush carried the
battle to African territory. For the first
ten minutes it looked as though the AH
Blacks, especially in the loose and in for-
ward rushes, had the measure of their
opponents, but the Springboks, by great
work in the scrums and ruck, helped by
flawless defence, and accurate tine-kick-
ing- among the backs, gradually worked
their way unfield. The N.Z. backs, too.
were tackling with deadly effect. Ensued
a scrimmage on the All Black 25 with the
ball quite out of sight of the spectators.
Then suddenly, from the thick of it,
emerged van Rooyen with the leather
under his arm and his long line of backs
moving up in perfect formation. From
Rooyen it travelled unerringly to ■
judges are of opinion that, allowing for
Meyer, to Michau, to Clarkson, who,
when faced by Storey, sent on for Sen-
din to score, with Zeller outside of him
in case of necessity. A very fine effort,
indeed, which was enhaned by a sure
kick from Gerhard Morkel.
PLAY SEE-SAWED AMAZINGLY.
Undaunted by this reverse, the A 1
Blacks returned to the attack more des-
perately than ever. Both sides were now
going at great speed, and the play see-
sawed up and down at an amazing rate
Attempts to open up the game came
mostly from the Springboks through the
agency of the scrum, where there is no
doubt they held an advantage, and from
the All Blacks in the loose, where they
showed superiority. But the tackling of
each side tvas too keen and sure for any
scores to come from back play.
From midfield Beilis broke away, wtih
McLean in hot pursuit. When tacklec
by the full-back he lost the ball, but Mc-
Lean recovered it, and in a twinkling
was over ten yards from the corner flag.
New Zealand gasped when Nicholls’ kick
struck the upright, but got to its feet
and yelled when the ball bounced in-
wards to make the score 5 all.
There followed, before the gong went,
12 minutes of Rugby that was too hard
and keen to be a brilliant exhibition of
the code, but much too exciting for the
onlookers to keep their seats for more
than half a minute at a stretch.
DEFENCE VERY SOLID.
On changing round the westering sun
was right in the eyes of the Springboks,
and probably a greater handicap than
it had been for the All Blacks. But the
ability to triumph over meteorological
conditions is part and parcel of the Inter-
national footballer's make-up, and, inso-
far as bright sunshine goes, at least, the
Africans showed that they can rise to
the occasion. A description of the second
forty-five would be almost a repetition of
the first, except that perhaps there were
more individual efforts, and also more
attempts at concerted play, all of which
came to naught by defence which never
for a second wavered.
One thrilling moment came when
Roberts sent his backs away in a fast
passing movement, which only wanted
Storey to receive—and it looked a cer-
tainty—-for a further try to N.Z.; but the
winger failed to hold Aitken’s transfer.
A ROBERTS TACKLE.
On a second occasion Africa heeled
smartly from a scrum near midfield, and
the ball reached Zeller going at top
speed for the comer. Outpacing Storey
and Kingston, a try seemed certain,
when, a foot from the line, he was
knocked spinning off his feet by a Black
figure which seemed to come from no-
where. It was Roberts, but how he got
there in time is a mystery that only he
can explain. Without doubt, it was the
finest effort in a game that bristled from
Start to finish with sparkling indivi-
duality, and I am not forgetting Morkel’s
great kick from 35 yards out. which
turned the tide finally in Africa’s favor
when it seemed they were weakening
under the All Black onslaught.
After that it was a desperate endeavor
by Beilis, Moffitt, and West, mostly, in
the forwards, and Nicholls, Roberts,
Steel, and Kingston, in the backs, to
save the day for N.Z. But Africa hung
on grimly to their lead by clean handling
and splendid line-kicking, which showed
Gerhard Morkel up as a great full-back
and the side generally as dour defenders
And so it ended 9 to 5. with N.Z. beaten
fairly and squarely, although there was
but little in it either way.
The game, as an exhibition of Rugby
was not what one could really term bril-
liant. But as a contest in which speed
determination, and desperate efforts to
break through a whirling defence by
either side, it surely reached the peak of
atnletic excellence.

The Circuses of the World.
Seen and Compared by George Wirth.
Wirths’ Circus had its beginning in a performance given in Sydney on New Year’s Eve, ISBO. The four brothers —John, Harry,
Phil, and George—themselves provided the band and the acts that constituted the entertainment. For many years the mammoth
enterprise into which the show has grown has been under the exclusive direction of Phil and George. World-visits—alternately by
the one and the other—have become almost an annual affair. The last to thus go in search of attractions was George, who recently
returned from a tour that embraced America, Great Britain, France, Belgium, and South Africa. With him was Mrs. Wirth. He
reports a most enjoyable trip, together with a number of engagements that will be seen during the forthcoming season of the circus
at Wirths’ Hippodrome, Sydney. Besides enumerating these in the article published below Mr. Wirth deals in an illuminating manner
with circus-life in America and on the Continent. A great change has taken place in England. There the circus in the true sense of
the word is dead. All that is to be seen are shows comparable to the smaller ones in Australia. The many other subjects covered
by Mr. Wirth—circus, theatrical, and general—complete a contribution that will be read with the keenest interest.
pTOR a long time America had two great
circuses in Ringling Brothers’ Circus and
the Barnum and Bailey Circus. To-day they
are a combined show. Mr. Wirth declares
it to be the greatest circus ever known.
The Ringling-Barnum-Bailey combination
carx-y a total of nearly 1500 people. ’Tis a
township in itself. Bewildering is the per-
formance. There are three rings and four
stages. But this does*not mean merely seven
acts at the one time. Sometimes there are
from twelve to fifteen attractions simul-
taneously before the audience,
“Your eye,” comments Mr. Wirth, “just
takes in as much as it can —or cares to.”
The best of everything in the world is
seen under the Ringling-Barnum-Bailey ban-
ner. They have their agents in every coun-
try. Whatever is offering—provided it has the
recommendation of merit and is to be secured
by money—will figure for a due period in
their progi'ammes.
Other circuses that Mr. Wirth saw in
America were the Sells-Floto Circus, the
Walter L. Main Circus, Sparkes’ Circus, and
Barnes’ Circus. Of course there are a lot
of smaller ones. But in those enumerated
you have America’s principal circuses.
“All the original Sells brothers,” says Mr
Wirth, “are dead. Among those who have
passed away are the three who once visited
Australia—Ephraim, Peter, and Louis. ‘Sells’
to-day is only a name.
“Sparkes has the finest lot of horses I
ever saw in my life. Black, white, cream,
and iron-grey. He matches them. By gad
they’i'e beauties! Not performing horses.
They’re used in the parades. Among the
artists are some who are the equal of anything
to be seen in the Ringling-Barnum-Bailey
Circus. They have grown up with the show
May Martin Wirth and One of Her Five Performing Greys.
Block by W. T. Baker & Co., Ltd.
—have been with it all their lives; and would
not leave it.
“Barnes specialises in wild-animal acts.
He has some wonderful attractions of this
character.”
During his four-months’ stay in New
York Mr. Wirth used to motor out to such
places as Atlantic City, Philadelphia, Balti-
more, and Boston —wherever in short he heard
anything special was to be seen. At the
same time he sought the pleasures of sight-
seeing.
“I always thought,” he says on this point,
“that I knew America. But I found that
this was far from being the case.”
Mr. Wirth went from America to Eng-
land, France, and Belgium. He considers
that the best circus acts —individual and' ani-
mal —are to be got in Germany. But he cut
out that country because of the refusal to
admit Germans to Australia.
There is no embargo of this kind in
England. Bui the artists there will not work
with Germans. Protection rather than
patriotism is the obvious explanation.
At the beginning of the war the Wirths
had some Germans with them in Australia.
But they had to get rid of them because of
the trouble they were causing. “One Ger-
man can eat five Englishman!” was merely one
of their pet boasts.
Ihe three principal French circuses are
the Cirque de Paris, the Nouveau Cirque, and
the Cirque Madrano. Mr. Wirth saw them
in Paris. The Cirque de Paris is the best.
‘Tip-top—the whole programme!” is how he
puts it. But the Nouveau Cirque is the
most popular, probably because it is in the
centre of the city.
Seventy-five per cent, of the circus perform rs are Germans! Of this the
French are fully aware, despite the a,ffectation by the Germans of Norwegian
and Swiss names. Nor do they mind in the least.
“Between,” proceeds Mr. Wirth, “the recognition of Germans by the English
Government and the refusal by English artists to appear in the same bill with
Germans comes this interesting fact—that half the theatrical agents in England
are Germans!”
Jt
There was really nothing in circuses for Mr. Wirth to see in England. A
few small ventures there are —comparable to the road-shows in Australia. But
beyond this the circus is unknown to the rising English generation.
The Wirths themselves showed in England in 1896-97.
Powerful opposition existed in those days. There were the brothers Lord
George and Lord John Sanger. Each had a fine circus. Fierce rivalry
prevailed between them. With them both “Lord” was merely a professional
designation At the same time there were two other large circuses—Hengler’s
Circus and Gennett’s Circus.
None the less the Wirths were well able to hold their own.
I realise, says Mr. Wirth, “that we could go to England to-day with every
prospect of su.ccess. But we ai*e no longer young, nor have we any desire to
leave Australia. Consequently it must lie with someone else to take advantage
of the undoubted opening there is in England for a circus proper.”
Mr. Wirth does not overlook the fact that last Christmas there was a six-
weeks’ circus season at the Olympia, with a second London circus on a smaller
scale at the Crystal Palace.
For these the horses and performers were bi-ought for the most part from
America and the Continent.
But spasmodic revivals of this character, he contends, in no way affect his
statement that circus-life in England in the true sense of the word is dead
Linked with American circuses ten years
ago was a very undesirable element.
By this Mr. Wirth means, even if he is
r eluctant to say it, a, lot of crooks. They
were favored in their operations by what was
then the carnival atmosphere of the shows.
But in this respect there has been a rigid
cleaning-up. Present-day circuses, besides
being conducted as honorable commercial un-
dertakings, are unattended by anything of a
remotely suspicious character.
Such is the outstanding change that Mr.
Wirth hos seen the business in America
undergo in the coui'se of his visits to that
country.
America has it over the rest of the
world in large-sized circuses. But in quality
Germany is supreme. At any rate that was
Mr. Wirth’s experience up to the time he was
last in that country.
Mr. Wirth’s engagements include the Aerial Lloyds (five men), Evans and
Perez (an Englishman and a Frenchman), the Morallis Family (two men and
four women), and Alfred Clarke. They were all secured from the Ringling-
Barnum-Bailey Circus, with the exception of Mr. Clarke, who was got from
Schumann’s Circus (Germany). The booking of Mr. Clarke, himself an English-
man, was effected by Mr. Wirth through Mr. Clarke’s father in England.
“Acts such as we want for Australia,’’explains Mr. Wirth, “are very hard to
get.”
There is so much work for them without coming here. Further, Mr. Wirth
saw performers by the dozen in America —getting good money, too —who were
not worth their passage-money to Australia. Generally it is because they want a
change that high-class people can be got for this part of the world.
Particularly was this the case with regard to Mr. Clarke.
“As a rider,” says Mr. Wirth, “there isn’t anywhere his equal. Somer-
saulting on a bareback horse is clever enough. But M!r. Clarke does —among
other things—a, front somersault from the ground to the horse’s back!”
Such a feat is declared by Mr. Wirth to be unique in circus history.
The Lloyds do what is technically known as a casting act —single, double,
treble, and twisting somersaults from the hands of one performer into the hands
of another; Evans and Perez will be seen in a risley-perch novelty; and the
Morallis —a most versatile combination—have a number of offerings that include
the trapeze, wire walking and sliding, and the trampoline.
One of the men does on the trampoline over a hundred consecutive somer-
saults !
Did Mr. Wirth in the course of his travels see anything better than what
at some time or other has been given in Australia?
Not a thing.
_ His comparison covers tumblers, acrobats, gymnasts, trapezists, flying tra-
pezists, wire-walkers, aerialists, ring horses, and performing animals. He leaves
out riders, wholly because of the world pre-eminence of Mr Clarke, whose riding
he. is himself seeing in Australia for the first time. With this exception Mr.
Wirth considers that the boy-riders in even the smaller shows in Australia are
as good as you will see in any other country.
“‘Tumbling,’” says Mr. Wirth, “is somersaulting on the ground; ‘acrobatics’
applies to the work of two or more men wherein they somersault to and from one
another s shoulders and to and from the ground; and ‘gymnasts’ are people who
take on the trapeze, the Roman rings, and the horizontal bars. Flying-trapezists
and aerialists are gymnasts, in a way; but they are more distinctively known
by those two terms.”
Because of the money she is making in vaudeville there is no prospect of
May Wirth, a niece of Phil, and George, and admittedly the greatest woman
circus-rider in the world, coming to Australia.
She has a beautiful stage setting. Her support comprises two men and
three girls. Five horses are introduced—all greys. Music, comedy, farce-
and-straight riding constitute the offering. The time occupied is from twenty
to twenty-five minutes. At the request of the managers she has eliminated a
number of her more daring feats, because of what they consider to be the danger
of them to herself, with the result that her performance on the stage is not the
equal of what it was in the circus ring.
All the same she is getting much more out of vaudeville for it.
The turn —it was worked out by the members of the family—can be given
on pretty well any first-class stage in America. The members of the combina-
tion include May’s sister Stella and the latter’s husband, Phillip St. Leon —a
son of Gus. St. Leon, and a brother of Gus., Reg., and Syl. St. Leon. Phillip,
a fine rider, is billed with May, due to the fact that he has made for himself
a name scarcely surpassed by hers. The rest in an advertising sense are nowhere.
Ah the same Mr. Wirth considers that Stella is as clever as either of them.
Her many duties include the writing of the words of the songs and the composing
of the music.
The combination will shortly play a ten-weeks’ season in England with Moss
and Stoll.
Mr. Wirth had the pleasure of meeting the Jordans —the mother and her
two daughters, Nellie and Josie.
The girls are doing a singing and double-wire act in vaudeville. Mrs.
Jordan lived for four or five years at hex 1 home in Jersey (New Jersey). She
is now travelling again with the girls.
It was only by a chance that Australia
had the opportunity of seeing the Jordans
through the Wirths.
Away back in 1911 Mr. Wirth was in an
agency office. With him was Mr. Wolheimer
—a member of the firm. They overheard a
voice in an adjoining room saying, “We want
an aerial act. We must have the Jordans.”
Mr. Wirth and Mr. Wolheimer both recognised
in the speaker John Ringling.
Mr. Wolheimer left Mr. Wirth.
Addressing Mr. Ringling he said, “You
can’t have the Jordans. They’re already
booked for Australia with the Wirths.”
Thus did Mr. Wolheimer stave off Mr.
Ringling. For the Jordans had not yet been
secured by Mr. Wirth. Later in conversation
with Mrs. Jordan and the two girls Nellie
asked Mr. Wirth if he didn’t want a press-
agent. Scenting an attachment Mr. Wirth
hastened the finalisation of matters by agreeing to the suggestion, with the result
that Ernie Bernstein —for many years now Nellie’s husband —was included in
the contract.
Mr. Wirth doesn’t think that he would ever have got Mrs. Jordan if she
had known Mr. Ringling was after her, because he could naturally have made
her lot much more comfortable in America. >-
John and Charles Ringling are the only brothers alive of a family of seven.
John s enormous interests include the ownership of a coal-mine and a
railway.. He is the man behind Tex Rickards, the promoter of the Dempsey-
Carpentier fight. Mr. Wirth was among the 100,000 who witnessed this contest,
the. arrangements for which—perfect in every detail —were made under the super-
vision of Mr. Ringling’s boss tent-man.

The Biggest Circus in Australasia, opening at Frome Road on Friday, July 14th.
Mr. Wirth saw a lot of the theatres in America, England, and France.
For daring in the paucity of dressing he thinks New York is beating Paris.
He was at “The Equity Annual Show,” at the Metropolitan Opera House.
The building was crowded from floor to ceiling with the elite of New York.
The minimum price of admission was lOdol.
“Many of the dancers,” remarks Mr. Wirth, “were almost nude. All they
wore was a pair of trunks. But the climax in this respect was reached in a
tableau wherein a girl, standing sideways to the audience, appeared in nothing
more than the covering with which she was born.”
A matter that particularly interested Mr. Wirth in America was the
exhibition at Fort Lee Ferry of what was described as “The Old Australian
Convict Ship”—in reality, the convict hulk, Success.
Depicted in the advertisements was a vessel, with a wealth of sails profusely
covered with broad-arrows.
The lettering was to the effect that it had been visited by “over 15,000,000
people,” and that in the boat were to be seen “all the airless dungeons and
condemned cells, the whipping-posts, the manacles, the branding irons, the
punishment balls, the leaden-tipped cat-o-nine tails, the coffin bath, and other
fiendish inventions of man’s brutality to his fellow-man.”
Further, it was “the oldest ship in the world,” and “raised from the bottom
of Sydney Harbor, Australia.”
Mr. Wirth sent some of the placards to W. M. Hughes, with the suggestion
that the Commonwealth should buy “the damned atrocity” and sink it. The
fact that he did not hear from Mr. Hughes in reply in no way interfered with
M; Wirth’s feeling that he at least had done his duty to his fellow-Australians. 1

AN EXCELLENT ENTERTAIN-

Of the 24 turns comprising the programme
submitted by Wirth Bros.' Circus, which
commenced their Christchurch season on
Saturday evening, on a site in Moorhouse
avenue, opposite the Railway Station, there
was not one that might be described as a
“dud.” The circuses that our grandpar-

this was the general verdict of the huge
audience that filled the capacious .tent on i

with rounds of spontaneous applause. Those

them at some distant period and believed i
that their like would never be seen again
were given cause to change their opinions
in the variety of wonderful turns presented
during the evening. The Uyeno Troupe of
Japanese presented the most remarkable
acrobatic feats ever seen in this city. If
there are Europeans, who can excel them
they have not yet appeared in the Dominion.
The variety of their tricks seemed almost
illimitable, and when they would execute
something that the audience was certain was
tile culminating point of their turn they
would next produce something just a littie
better. Their training is obviously com-
plete, and they commence where others fin-
ish. One member of the troupe proved an
adept on the trapeze, and took a keen de-
light in balancing himself on his head on
the bar of a trapeze high up in the tent.
In this perilous position he produced a
bottle of cordial, which he opened, poured
; into a tumbler, and, while still inverted,
drank it with obvious relish. Then, just 1
to show how simple it all was, he went _or.e |
better, and continued to balance himself in
a similar position, the trapeze meanwhile
being set swinging, and later spinning.
A muscular member of the troupe got on his
back on the ground, and balanced a stout
and length v pole on his feet. Up the
pole a youthful Japanese quickly climbed,
and, on getting to the apex, went through
a number of astounding stunts, the man
supporting the pole, although the strain
I must have 'been a heavy one, showing not
the slightest sign of distress. The whole
ti-oupe made light of tumbling and somer-
saulting back and forward, and, as an ex-
ample of what could be done in this con-
nexion, the smallest member turned 30 or
40 somersaults on a small table in a man-
ner which reminded one of the revolutions
of a windmill. It is an their footwork,
however, that the Japanese excel, juggling
by this means with their youths in a man-
ner that is nothing short of marvellous.
Three of the most powerful tossed the hoys
about as an ordinary juggler deals with a
ball. The boys were passed from one pair
of feet to another with unerring precision,
and occasionally, to make the Teat harder,
the lads would be tossed across to the far
pair of feet, the middle one® being _cut out,
as footballers often throw pact a m?n in the
playing field. Before they concluded their
wonderful performance the Uyeno Troupe
spun the boy 3 two or three times, the lat-
ter describing double somersaults a® they
passed on to the feet waiting to receive
them, and ultimately to land in an upright
position.
Some wonderful trapeze work was done by
the Aerial Flying Lloyds, four clever Ame-
ricans making their first appearance with
the management. They performed numer-
ous hair-raising feats new to Christchurch,
Henry Lloyd concluding a meritorious per-
formance by executing double and triple
somersaults in mid-air. The last-mention- i
ed stunt was remarkable in its daring.
From the feet of his brother, who was
swinging on a trapeze, he was sent through
space across to where another brother was
swinging. Catching the latter’s feet, he
swung therefrom until he had gained suf-
ficient momentum for his purpose. He then
released his hold and turned three distinct
somersaults before he landed safely on the
springing platform beneath him. Wirth’s i
troupe of Arabs, assisted by the Japanese, I
provided a wonderful exhibition of tumbling \
such as baffles description. Their agility 1
was astounding, and their trick® followed ®o
hard and fast after each other they
were bewildering and difficult for* the eye
to take in. Thunderous applause greeted •
the conclusion of the act
A remarkable display of horsemanship
was given by Alfred Clark®, who is described)
as the world’s champion jockey and trick and
somersault rider. His claim to the distinc-
tion was borne out by his performance. He
threw backward and forward somersaults
from the ground on to the back of a gallop-
ing bare-backed horse with the greatest of
ease. Numerous other feat® were also done
by him in the same masterly fashion. Later
in the programme he rode into the ring
standing on the hack of a horse, and while
the animal cantered round, the arena ne
| carried out .some clever juggling. Mis® Ethel
: Wirth, a dainty young lady, an equestrienne
of a high order, gained warm appreciation
of her excellent performance on a bare-
backed horse, and immediately established'
herself as a favourite. Lessons in how to
fall from housetops without injury to one-
j self was the subject of the turn given by the
strong man, “The Mighty Muldoon.” After
carrying out some clever acrobatic comedy
work, he placed a table on the ground, and,
piling two others on top of it, followed by
two solid-loking boxes, topped the lot with
a chair, on which he calmly seated himself.
At this dizzy height he commenced to sway
backwards and forwards until the whole
structure fell to the ground. Quite unper-
turbed, Muldoon rose, and with hi® cigar,
which he had kept smoking throughout his
turn, still alight, he walked off as if falling
from such a height was a most exhilarating
pastime.
The performance given by Apdale’s Zoo,
consisting of dogs, monkeys, bears, and ah
ant-eater, was in itself, most of the audi-
ence concluded, well worth the price of ad-
mission. Riding a cycle, playing a banjo,
to the strumming of which a dog danced, and
walking on their fore legs, were some of the
tricks done by the bears. The monkey, when
his mischievous antics at the expense of the
j other animals were temporarily desisted an
by him, showed that his ability as an enter-
tainer was second to none of his co-perform-
er®. Even the ant-eater, the first of it®
species that many of the audience had ever
seen, showed that the time and attention
spent in its training had achieved success.
It used to be said that it would be fatal to
a trainer of wild animals to take hi® eye®
from them when putting them through their
performance. Captain Lindo shows that this
impression is quite wrong. He frequently
allowed the four lions and a bear that have
been trained by l*im to get behind him. Al-
though one of the lions kept up a continu-
ous resentful snarl, the crack of the trainer’s
whip kept its ferocity within bound®, and
made it jump over hurdles and through a
blazing hoop. La Belle Onra gave a won-
derful exhibition on the trapeze, for which
she was rewarded with hearty applause.
Other numbers on the programme, "all of
which were popular, were a serpentine dance
by Miss Daisie, tricks by the miniature race-
horse “Brisbane,” by the performing ele-
phants, by Dan Goslin and his trained geese,
F. Freeman and six horses, eight ladies and
gentlemen on horseback, and Miss Polio on
horseback. The clowning turns of Dan, Joe,
and Fred kept the audience in a state of
continuous merriment. Prior to the per-
formance a procession of the member® ot
the company encircled the interior of the
tent. Mr J. W. Cooke, who in his day was
a great circus horseman, wa® chief ring-
master throughout the evening, and under
his experienced eye the whole performance
went off with wonderful smoothness. Many
people in the audience have been patrons of
Worth’s circus for many years, and to them
the appearance of the familiar figure of Mr
Philip Wirth, who acted as ringmaster for
Mis® Ethel Wirth’® clever turn, wa® one of
the outstanding incident® of a most ©movable
evening. J J
The animals in the menagerie will be fed
from 4 p.m. till 5 p.m. daily, to see which
a small charge will be made.
Evening performances will be given
throughout the week, and there will be ma-
tinees on Wednesday and Saturday.

LION TURNED
Mauled Tamer Escapes
SYDNEY, Wednesday.—A man
was badly mauled by a lion at an
exhibition at Lismore to-day. He
entered the cage, and was imme-
diately attacked. Many women
fainted.
There was a wild rush for th:
exits lest the lion got loose. The
tamer, however, managed to get ou
and slam the door on the infuriated
beast.
LION-TAMER ATTACKED.
SYDNEY, Wednesday.—There was ex-
citement in a large tent at Lismore Agri-
cultural Show on Tuesday. A man who
was performing with a lion was attacked.
When he entered the animal’s cage the
lion gripped him by the arm. He was able
to wrench himself away, and make for the
door of the cage. The lion pawed him on
the back, tearing his flesh with its claws.
He escaped, and slammed the door. The
spectators were alarmed. Women fainted.
The injured man, Lindon, was admitted
to Lismore Hospital suffering severely.
MONTANA BELLE WAS
“QUICKER ON DRAW”
Pleads She Killed Jordan
Murphy, Circus Rider, in
Self-Defense
Kansas City, May 9.
Mrs. Effie B. Griffey, known as
“Montana Belle,” shot and instantly
killed Jordan Murphy, a rider with
the circus with which they were
traveling, at Kennett, Mo., last Fri-
day. According to reports, the
shooting occurred about five miles
outside the town.
The woman is the owner of the
small show. The slain man, who
was also known as Jimmy Valen-
tine, was a stunt rider.
After the shooting Mrs. Griffey,
still in costume, rode on her broncho
to Kennett, where she surrendered
to the officials. She pleaded self-
defense, but was held for the action
of the coroner. She told the sheriff
she and her husband bad i*eared
the slain man; that he threatened
to kill her, but she was quicker “on
the draw.”
Frank Wirth is developing a plan
to book a series of summer parks on
the circuit plan. Those already
lined up for the season make it pos-
sible to start acts at the De Wal-
thoff parks —New Haven, Hartford
and Waterbury—for three weeks,
and going thence to Mid-City Park,
Albany; Sea Breeze, Rochester;
Williamsport, N. Y., Carlin's, Balti-
more, and. Rendezvous, Atlantic
City.' Other points are in negotia-
tion to extend the plan.

WIRTH’S CIRCUS
To-night at the Hippodrome there
will be a benefit performance given in
aid of the Children’s Home, Warra-
imoo, and a number of distinguished
c Iple will be present. The Govern-
ment House party will consist of Sir
Walter Davidson, Dame Margaret (
Davidson, the Misses Daphne and
Decima Davidson, Sir Arthur and
Lady Stanley, and the Acting Premier
(Mr. C. W. Oakes). The boxes will
be occupied bv Sir Arthur Rickard and
partv, Sir Denison Miller and party.
Mr. Theo Murks, Mr. It. B. Orchard,
Mr. N. Mend'es, and the medical stu-
dents.
The organiser (Mrs. J. A. Wilson)
has had numerous requests to enter
the lions’ den. She has consented to
do so, providing some good samaritan
will donate the sum of £lOO to the
homes.
CIRCUS LLFE
A PROPRIETOR'S EXPERIENCE.
THE UPS AND~DOWNS OF THE
ARENA.
Circus life, from the manager's point
of view is im great contrast to what is
seen of the performances by people, who
encircle the arena. Whilst the multitude
applaud the dauntless feats of a “queen
of the trapeze," the proprietor views
with almost a tragic seriousness the
success or otherwise of hie attempts to
please and entertain the populace.
A “Time's" repo iter sought out Mr
Philip 'Wirth, of Messrs'. Wirth Bros.'
big circus, which was in Wellington the
other day to obtain from him an insight
into the management of the concern. A
rehearsal was in full stung—a horseman
was practising a “bounding jockey" act,
so dear to the hearts of the juvenile
patrons of the circus.
The subject of cost was first broached.
“In Australia," said Mr Wirth, “our
menagerie and circus costs us over AlOO
a day inclusive of salaries, feed for the
animals, rent—in fact, everything. But
in New Zealand owing to a number of
extra expenses our liabilities run into over
A2OO a week more. The Union Company
charge us Al9OO to transport our show
from Sydney to Hobart, thence to Bluff,
Lyttelton to Wellington, hence to Picton,
Nelson, Westport, Greymouth, back to
Wellington, and to New Plymouth and
Onehunga, and finally from Auckland to
Sydney, W e have to accomplish the
whole round trip m ten weeks, so you
see we need the best of good luck to puli
ns through. On top of this there is rail-
age in New Zealand, which runs into
over 15s 6d a mile. In this connection
we feel that we might have been ‘let
down’ a little easier. In Australia we
pay 10s a mile and 7s 6d return, which,
whilst not crushing, is ample when other
contingencies lnuve to be reckoned up.
“We have forty ling attendants,
grooms, etc., and forty artists, musicians,
trainers agents. Our caravan com-
prises fourteen cages of wild animals,
nine great waggons for seating accommo-
dation and our own gas lighting appara-
tus. One vehicle weighs ten tons; it is
pulled with ease by the largest elephant.
“ Y\*b could create a famine in a small
community when we reckon on 1401b© of
raw beef, a day, half a ton of hay, half
a ton of chaff, three bags of oats and six
hags, of bran per day*. Here is an in-
ventory of our live stock —fifty horses
and ponies, six elephants, three camels,
two water-buffalos, a zebu J Ceylon ox),
guanaoo (somewhat resembling a diminu-
tive camel), three Japanese bears, Hima-
layan bear, a boxing kangaroo) Polar
bear, Indian leopard, jackal, baboon, ape,
hyena, two jaguars., five royal Bengal
tigers, a handsome lion bred in Mel-
bourne, five performing lions and two
lionesses, wildebeest©, wild boar, numer-
our monkeys, goats, performing dogs,
and a. zebrule (bred from a Scottish'
pony mare and a b»K»). { *v.r live freaks
are" a three-legged pony, a three-legged
goat, five-legged heifer, three-legged
sheep, and a pony with hoofs resembling
long horns."
Questioned as to their treatment in
New Zealand, Mr Wirth acknowledged
general kindness on .all sides. “But,”
he said with some warmth, “a very* un-
fair imposition of a five-guinea license
fee per night is taken from us by town
councils in places such as Timaru and
Oainaru, and added to that there is, of
course, a nightly rent of five guineas.
This is an unnecessary expense which
is never heard of in Australia. All we
do is to get a permit from the Premier,
which cost© nil. and we show this license
to the Superintendent of Police when de-
manded. _ '
“A few citizens in New Zealand have
a mistaken idea that we take away all
the money from a small town. This i©
quite erroneous. We really cause the
money to circulate. As a matter of fact
! we bring farmers into towns from sur-
I rounding districts, and you know that
• means the spending of money. Of course,
our own money also goes out in a steady
stream wherever wo are.
“Two of our tents cost A5OO each, and
the one we are using now for the circus
arena seats 1800 people. 'We have a
much larger ore—l should say the re-
mains of one—which could hold 2500
•people. We have visited Wellington
twenty-four times, and, incredible to
outsiders though it may seem, we have
been blown down on every occasion ex-
cept, this time —but we have not finished
here yet, so perhaps it is premature to
refer to our good luck. AVe carry our
whole show to the smallest towns, and
give the same class of programme every-
where. The elephants are'the most in-
telligent of all our animals. I would not
take AlOOO for any of them. They save
us A4OOO a year in haulage. No express
company in Australasia is able to handle
our stuff in one day as we do. One
animal pulls more than any eight horses.
I really believe it would pay farmers to
buy L them for ploughing and harvesting.
OLD FRIENDS
Kiama. —When the old elephant.
Princess Alice, performed here at
Wirth’s Circus last night, an interest-
ing reminiscence was related by Ser-
geant J. Blagrave, who is retiring from
the Police Force this month after
35| years’ service. Fifty odd years
ago, when a boy of seven, the sergeant
remembers riding on Alice, when she
and another elephant named Jumbo,
carried youthful passengers around
the London Zoo, and on the particular
day recalled the late Prince Edward
(King George’s brother), and other
children of the Royal family were
passengers. The old elephant, which
is known to he over 110 years of age,
has quite an interesting history. When
her mate, Jumbo, to whom she was
greatly attached, was sold, and was
being shipped to another country, the
only way they could induce him or.
board was to use Alice as a decoy
When she was led on the ship, Jum-
bo quietly followed, and when stall-
ed Alice was taken off again, hut she
fretted so much afterwards that the
Zoo authorities, fearing she would
die, sdld her cheap to Bostock’s. the
circus people, from whom Wirth
Brothers’ bought her. I
GIRL MARVEL
New 880 Record
AMERICAN CHAMPION
Fanny Durack s Case
By TRUDGEN |
America has unearthed still another 1
gill swimmer of world championship
calibre in Virginia Whitnack, 15-years-
old member of the New York Women’s
Swimming Association, who swam 880
yards at Nev York last Saturday in
13 min. 30 secs.
The accredited woman’s world’s re-
coil' stands against Claire Galligan’s
name at 13 min. 31 4-5 secs. She
achieved the record over a 100
course at Belmar, U.S.A., on August
18, 1918.
Virginia Whitnack first came into
prominence last year, when she carried
off the New York Metropolitan 220
yards junior championship, and swam
15th in the big 3£ miles “Joseph P.
Day” international cup ocean race,
from Jamaica Bay to Brighton Beach
in New York Bay. There were 52
starters, and all finished.
Miss Whitnack swims the American
trudgeon crawl stroke demonstrated
by Miss Annette Kellerman in “The
Guardian” last week—and is a pupil
of the famous coach, L. de B. Handley.
Her best time for 100 yards is about
69 sees. Helen Wainwright and Ger-
trude Ederle, the sixteen years old
clubmates of Miss Whitnack, have bet-
tered her time, but not under record
conditions.
FANNY DURACK
The great war was probably respon-
sible for depriving Miss Fanny Durack,
Australian and Olympic champion, and
undoubtedly the best all-round swim-
mer the world has ever known, of:
recognition for many world’s records,
and, if she had been justly treated, her
name would now appear on the world’s
record list against the 880 yards, for
she swam the distance at the Domain
Baths in 12 min. 42 secs!
This feat was endorsed by N SW*.
A.S.A. and forwarded to the Inter-
national Federation tor consideration
as a world’s record, but, strangely
enough, recognition has never been
granted.
A HUMAN FISH
Fan i iv' Durack, in her prime, was a 1
marvellous swimmer over distances.,
On one occasion, during a mile swim, ’
w s -r.ftov-ftd world’s records for every ,
intermediate distance. Some idea of
her speed and stamina may be gauged
>y comparing her present world’s mile
record of 28 min. 8 secs., put up on
February 23, 1914, in Sydney Domain
Baths, over 110 yard laps, when the
half-mile was passed in 12 min. 52
secs., with the 880 yards world’s re-
cords of Misses Galiigan— 13 min. .31
4-5 secs, and Whitnack —-13 min 50
secs.
'T'hes.'e half-mile world’s record times,
added together, total 27 min. 1 4-5 secs.,
wmen proves that Miss Durack could
have beaten the pair by 53 4-5 secs
over a mile, had they each swum a
relay of half a mile each, whilst she
covered the whole distance herself.
The Australian Swimming Union is
MISS FANNY DURACK, ex-World’s
and Australian and N.S.W. Champion,
who swam 880 yards 48secs. faster
than Miss Whitnack, but who gained
no recognition tor her wonderful
effort.
determined that a big fight will be
made to obtain recognition for Miss
i i.a ks performances, even at this
late date.

TEMORA THRILLS
SHOW TENTS TAKE WINGS
ROOFS CUT OFF
TEMGORb, Thursday.
A terrific cyclone has jeen raging
here and doing much damage. At the
showground tents were blown down in
all directions.
Jimmy Sharman’s boa. g tent' was
first to go. The two main poles snap-
ped like carrots. McCoy, one of the
boxers, was hit on the back with a
pole, and cut about one eye.
Small side-show; were blown like
pieces of paper.
Twenty or thirty men were helping
to keep the “Globe of Death” tents
down, when one standing on top was
lifted clean oyer. He was lucky, and
got off uninjured. The top of the tent
was saved by a man climbing up and
cutting the ropes.
In the lions' tent the animals
were exercising, but the manager
succeeded in getting the > caged
before the tent went with the hur-
ricane. The cage rose on two
wheels, but assistance at harm pre-
vented its toppling over. It is now
tied down.
Clara, the baboon, in the miniature
circus, sheltered herself by putting
bags over her head.
About 20 men took shelter beneath a
side wall, but it was blown down, and
it struck one man hard on the head,
inflicting severe cuts.
In the town ornr> Mental trees are
uprooted everywhere.
In Newtown, Pardy’s wheat shed was
unroofed at the western end, and me
iron was blown over into the railway
yards—a distance of 150 ft.
E. Cams had the roof and rafters
of his house cut off as if by a knife.
Several other places were dam-
aged. in the railway yard tne
wheat sheds were unroofed. Tne
verandahs are blown off a number
of houses in town, and a part of
the Ciub Hotel is gone.
RUN OF BAD LUCK
firths’ Circus Tour
THIRTEEN OF EVERYTHING
BRISBANE, Saturday.
Superstitious folk, who regard the
figure 13 as of special significance,
will henceforth be able to quote the
experiences of George V, irth. of Wirth
Brothers’ circus, in support of their
pet theory.
Mr. Wirth, who is accompanied by
ihis wife, left Brisbane by the Sydney
mail train tins morning for the sou' 1 h.
He stated that when t! circus left
Sydney for its Queensland tour its
complement inc’uded 13 ladies, 13 ele-
phants, 13 lions, and 13 ponies.
One of the lady members of the
company died suddenly at Merriwa,
New South Wales. Later the circus
lost by death a rhinoceros, a baboon,
a leopard, a lioness, a pony, a horse,
a hear, a monkey, a zebra, and an ele-
phant, and in addition half of the cir-
cus people were laid up at one time
or another as the result of the influ-
enza or accident.
Mr. Wirth became seriously ill with
influenza on July 13, and three davs ,
later had to be taken from the special
train chartered by the circus to a
private hospital in Mount Morgan,
where Mrs. Wirth stayed with him.
Mrs. Wirth was taken to a private
hospital in Brisbane on the morning
of the 13t.h inst., and the circus left
Queensland and opened its New South
Wales tour on the same day.
WORLD’S GIANT DEAD.
FORMER LONDON POLICEMAN
NVIIO WAS OVER EIGHT FEET.
Tallest man in the world- —he Mood
Bft 4in —George Anger, the famous cir-
cus giant, has m New lork from
indigestion. He was born in Cardiff,
and as a young man served as a police-
man in London, where he was a familiar
figure in Queen Victoria’s escort. Auger
was regarded as the king of freaks in
the United States, and his favourite
picture shows him holding a dwarf in
the palm of his hand. He was in the
bathroom when death, came, and the
weight of his falling body broke• the
floor. Auguer’s funeral brought to-
gether the strangest group of mourners
ever seen in New' York. Among them
were Lentini, a three-leged man; Car-
rie Holt, a freak weighing 42 stones 12
pounds; Air and Mrs Joe Short, famous
•midgets,- and other representatives ■o?
Hie Circus Hall of Human Curios.
Auger’s coffin was eight feet six inches
long, three feet wide, and two feet
deep, and weighed 36b pounds with his
body.
“Have you ever seen on the screen
a man climbing up the tekyscrapers?
“They call him ‘The Human Fly.’
Each time he climbs a building he
earns SOOOdol. (£400). East week I
saw him climb up the Flat Iron Build-
ing—about twenty-five floors. Oh, it
was a hair-raiser! Everyone just
watches. Well, yesterday the poor
chap did his final climb. When he
got up nine storeys of the Martinque
Hotel on Broadway lie lost his ftiot-

ney followers of Rugger were more
ootimistic about the prospects of the
team for the remainder of the tour,
th ugh few actually thought they could
.defeat New Zealand in the first Test.
The fields of Dunedin are not what Syd-
ney footballers are accustomed to, and
the absence of the rugged type of half-
back w uld be felt. Even slowness would
have been forgiven if the player in this j
positit n were one who could stand up to ]
the onslaughts of wing forward Beilis -
and the other fiery wearers of the Silver :
Fern. The defeat therefore, has not
bt, ;n a surprise—rather the other way.

fancies that N.S.W. would be favorites

the OPENING! SPELL,
In the first half the home forwards
had :he better of matters. Beilis scored
after the Bia-k forv ards hac carried
play 'to the line. For a time play wa:
'fair y even. Nothling missed a penalty
‘hot t goal, and a little later a penalty
pvas n against him for lying on the

jj Erasmus, who was injured, gave way
to Lour;on. Good passing by the Blue
backs, Sheehan, Stanley and Smith par-
ticipating, enabled the last named to open
the scoring for the visitors—6-3. Til-
yard scored another try for N.Z., Sin-
clair goaling. The latter also kicked a
penalty goal, and at half-time N.Z. led

Smith, the Manly three-quarter, dis-

/ ! blacks I'ile Up Record Score
for Test Match Old Clones
Revived: Sydney Rugger
(By RAMP'. FR.)
winning by 34 to 6, New
Zealand demonstrated that the
present New South Wales team
i? no match for them. The
tourists are not a powerful
team. If they had stretched
the New Zealanders in the Tests,
it would not. have been hearten-
ing for next season’s English
campaign. As it is, the prospects
cf the All Blacks must be con-
sidered excellent.
The performance of New South Wales
against New Zealand in the first Test,
even though beaten, did not. make Syd-
ney enthusiasts pessimistic, for there
were reasons to beli .ve they would do
better. The big defeat by Southland,
j however, was another matter. Now
: comes the record victory to the Blacks.
; The Light Blues left the field at Christ-
: church on Saturday well trounced, with
a margin of 28 points (34-6). It is plain
that New South Wales wants a few big
backs (especially amongst the insides)
to stand up to the rushes of the Maori- j
land forwards. Mingay, George, Shce- j!
ban and Stanley, clever and elusive jj
enough, evidently cannot stand up to j|
the sustained battering.
Conditions were not unsuitable to the j!
Sydney men, so no excuse can be <
offered. The team was beaten fore rid
aft. After the first Test at Dunedin, e
action of the home selectors in cbaogF'g
the personnel has been entirely justiued.
The goal-kicking by Sinclair Vv-aa very
fine. Of seven tries scored he converted
five, and ;dso kicked a penalty goal— - j
anothe-- Billy Wallace. Lucas (?), Bell, !
Williams, Pringle,^Richardson, and Pcina [
scored for New Zealand, and Erasmus
and Marrott for New South Wales.
Fourteen thousand witnessed the con-
test.

fly to Paris via Amsterdam, going
from there to Marseilles, sailing Aug.

of acts with Moss Empires and comes
back in November to see them started.
This week Wirth received a cable
from the Ringlings instructing him to
secure an attorney to enjoin a color-
able imitation of the Barnum & Bailey
trademark in this country. It seems
there was a touring tent show using
lithographs closely resembling the B.
& B. paper, reading: “Sylvester pre-
sents greater than” in small letters,
followed by “Barnum & Bailey” in
large type. Upon investigation Wirth
found the organization had already
gone to smash. He says there is also
a band of ex-soldiers on the Rhine
presenting a “Wild West” show and
billing themselves as “Barnum and
Bailev.”
Elephant Attacks Attendant.
CAbTLEMAINE.—WhiIst a huge ele-
phant, belonging to Wirths’ circus, was
being removed from its truck at the Castie-
rnaine railway station on Tuesday, the am-j
mal viciously attacked one of the attend-!
ants named Summers, who was standing!
near the truck. The elephant struck Sunei
mers with its trunk, and, rushing at him,j
knocked him down between the truck and 1
the platform. It then galloped wildly into!
Kennedy-street, and the crowd of people,!
including a large number of children, who 1
had been watching the unloading of the
animals, scampered in all directions. -V
number of horses a Lo took fright, and tore
down a panel of fe icing to which they
were tethered. The elephant continued
its mad career along Keunedy-streefc, but
gradually became pacified, and was recap-
tured by the keeper (Victor Lee). un-
rners was removed to the Castlemaine Hos-
pital, where it was found he had sustained
several broken ribs, a crushed lung and
hemorrhage. It will be several weeks be-
fore be, will be able t» leave Ihe institu-
tion.
xiic i L-Jing VvinskillH, one of the

a four-weeks’ season prior to sailing
for South Africa, where a 12-weeks’
contract awaits them. From there
intend sailing for England.

appeared were but a few of the

OPERATION ON AN ELEPHANT
ANIMAL KILLS SURGEON.
(United Service.)
LONDON, Thursday.
“The Times” correspondent in Rome
says Toto, the largest African elephant
in' the local zoo, savagely killed Dr.
Ganezza, who was operating on the
animal for an abscess. Canezza had
previously operated on a big orang-
outang, which seemed t<p realise that
the operation was beneficial, it quietly
submitted, lying motionless on a tabic.
Ganezza fully expected the elephant to
display similar intelligence, but the
attendants held Toto’s head m chains.
At the third incision the elephant jerked
its head free, dashed Ganezza to the
ground, and trampled him underfoot,
breaking every rib. The elephant then
lifted the body with its trunk and beat
it against this bars of the cage.
Mr. and Mrs. George Wirth, on their
recent travel of the world, visited South
Africa, and went to Port Elizabeth
(Mrs. Wirth’s home town) and brought
away with them Mrs. Vv irth s niece,
Miss Jessie Wiseman, who is enjoying
her six months holkiay in Australia
immensely. She says Australia is a
wonderful country. She, with her aunt
and uncle, has been visiting all the
places of note by motor car. She thinks
the Australian children are marvellous,
and she has spent some days at the
Exhibition inspecting their work, as Miss
Wiseman takes a great interest in cjnl-
dren, and had classes of them in Port
Elizabeth. y
Thirty-eight years ago the
Bros, worked a tent show throughout
Australia. The Agricultural Show
dates were secured, and money camej
to the popular Wirth family rapidly.
Their future was secured, as is evi-
denced by the vast, successful strides
the Wirth Family have made this side
of 38 years ago. Good luck to them!
At the inception stage. Harry. Phillip
and George and their two sisters were
in the show. Harrv p laved the
clown, George did ladder tricks. Phil-
lip played the trombone. Harry the
Gornet. and George the tenor-horn out-
side the tent before the show started,
while the sisters used to beat the
drums. In that period George Wirth,
in addition to his multifarious duties,
surprised the patrons with a clever
I jockey att..
Enrico Rastelli closed the first
half. ITe’s billed as “The Master
Juggler of the World.” And he un-
doubtedly is; for if there’s any
juggler who can top him he’ll have
to be more than a marvel. Rastelli
proves the old saw—that no one can
do more than one thing at a time
and do it well —is apple sauce. Ras-
telli does five things at one time,"
juggling with his feet, hands and
legs, and balancing something on
his.chin. • It takes a good silent turn
to hold the closing intermission
position and Rastelli is all of that.
He can hold any position.

MACK AY, July S.
Early yesterday morning one of the
elephants belonging to Wirths’ Circus
got loose. It strolled into the railway
station yard nearby where it came
across a truck of produce loaded for
north, and helped itself to two bags
of pollard after tearing off the tar-
paulin. After having as much pollard
j as it cared for, the animal seems to
have become thirsty and it pulled up
a .three-quarter inch water pipe. It
then continued its stroll and wan-
dered on to the railway station plat-
form, where it investigated the l ock-
stall, and liberally bestrewed the plat-
form with books, magazines, cigars
| cigarettes and other wares, besides
eating some fruit. Leaving the
wrecked stall, the elephant then
smashed in the crossing gates and the 1
1 goods shed gates, and then proceeded
I to another truck of produce, where it
helped itself to maize and potatoes.
A mango tree also received attention,
some of the branches being pulled off.'
When Mr Conway, manager of the re-
freshment rooms, arrived on the sta-
| tion at four o’clock, he noticed ' the
wreckage at the bookstall and drew
the attention of the assistant station-
j master, who informed the elephant
keeper. The elephant was recaptured
without trouble. * u
I V* ben the railway men came tb the
?Jackr,y -assenger station the other
morning they were under the impres-
sion a blizzard had struck the'place.
1 Worse than that had occurred, for one
of Wirth’s elephants had drifted over
and commenced business by eating
Ml the apples a.nd other fruit which
v r as covered on a stall. When that
was finished he absorbed some ehoco-
| MWs, but wrecked the newspaper and
I bookstall in search of further food,
j Tins of c igare*..tes were scattered far
j and wide, and a bag of potatoes show-
ed rough handling.

Soldiers and Girl Clerks Mua
Not Be Friends.
—Official Order,
I A bombshell has just been cast into t~~
big Australian military office iix Hor
ferry-road, Westminster. The office liasJ|
staff of some hundreds of girl clerks, as w
as a staff of soldier clerks, military poli
etc., all members of the Australian I
perial Forces, and many of them weari <
on their arms the big A which denotes ;
original Anzac from Gallipoli peninsula. 1
. The relations between the two staffs, tL
civil and the military, have been vei
pleasant and cordial. The girl clerks havfc
afforded many of the young Australian
the chance to visit English homes of tnf
righ. kind, and to form a circle of social
acquaintances such as they left behind
them in Australia. All over-sea soldiers in
London have pot been so fortunate, and, if
one is to credit the correspondence that
has recently been appearing in the papers,
have been fill the worse for the lack of
some outlet for their ordinary social in-
stinct.
, The friendly relations existing between
me two staffs, however, has come under the
roue© of the Australian Military Adminis-
rration, and the Administration has de-
uded that it will not do. Accordingly, the
allowing notice has just been issued to the
nembers of the two staffs:—
The following extract from office
orders is brought to your notice
The strictest discipline is to be main-
tained between the A.I.F. and the civi-
ban staff. This covers both the period
of office hours and AFTEE WARDS. No
communi cation should take place be-
tween the two sets of staffs, other than
that demanded by the exigencies of the
Service. If this instruction is not
strictly carried out, arrangements will
be made to place all the A.I.F. staff in
barracks. Individual failure to observe
the above rule will be followed by the
soldier being returned to Tidworth.
“A GRATUITOUS INSULT.”
Thus, while kindly British women are
intnvmg new means of providing a little
icial life for the over-sea soldiers in this
>untry, and while the controversialists
re disputing as to the best means of keen-
ig them away from Delilahs of the street,
us trail an officialdom steps in to close the
gitimate and honourable road to a little
?quamtance with home life. It backs its
with threats, which adds sting to
hai, both soldier and girl clerks regard as
gratuitous insult.
, ~tt is & scandal/’ said one of the
Idler cxerks, ' because I happen to know
at many ol the boys have been so much

JOE LEWIS HAS A BIG DAY
August 30 at Lincoln, Neb., was a big day
for Joe Lewis, the Yiddisher Cowboy, in the
way of meeting many old friends and making
new ones with the Singling Bros, and Barnum
6 Bailey Combined Shows. “I, for one,”
writes Lewis, "motored one hundred miles from
Columbus, Neb., to Lincoln a day previous
so as to be like the youngster, not even miss
the early arrival of the circus trains. The
show, having 59 miles from Omaha, arrived at
7 a.m. The last section, the one big feature
of all, rolled in at 8:30 a.m. The parade was
given at 11:45 and the procession was mighty
elaborate. The first one I met was Johnny
Agee, who carried a smile of welcome from
ear to car. Then I met Fred Bradna, the
equestrian director, one of the aces of cir-
eusdom, after which I visited Clown Alley.
Here they are: Jimmy Spriggs, the boy that
made Toledo famous (Ask Jack Dempsey);
George Ilartzel, a clown hard to beat; Mickey
McDonald (be tells mo the kid is walking
now), Harry Clemens, well known favorite;
The Bakers in their auto muubers, cleverly
performed; Paul Jerome, John Salter, Al Miaco,
Jules Turaoir, Herman Joseph, the little yicL
with the funny smile—positively the best line-
up of joeys I ever witnessed from a grand
stand. I enjoyed their work immensely.
“Miss Leitael was received heartily by her
audience. Her feature finish of sixty-seven
revolutions was wonderful. May Wirtb, the
equestrienne, has no equal in her line of work,
and her splendid offering brought forth volumes
of applause. Fred Worrell, the master mind
of this great enterprise, manager and super-
intendent, seems to be putting on some weight.
He sure looks the picture of health. Lew
Graham has the best side show in the world,
and from the executives to the work boys all
are enjoying a good iseason. Mer®e Evans
has a band hard to equal. All told it was
one great day for the missus and me.”
Con Coileano, whilst doing his wire
act at Sydney Tivoli, one afternoon last
week, slipped and broke one of his
toes. After having the injured member
attended to, Coileano went on with the
night show as usual. Coileano is pre-
senting one of the most hazardous acts
in present-day vaudeville.

“Joe,” the Wirths’ popular clown, is ex-
changing his capacious spotted garments for
khaki Joseph Bannister is his unprofes-
sional name, and he has followed his stren-
uous calling for 23 years, 15 of them in
Germany. While in Berlin he tried to
•popularise British methods of boxing, and
asked permission to run a stadium. He gave
an exhibition at Potsdam Palace, but \\ il-
hehn, after watching for a couple of rounds,
decided that there was not enough frightful-
ness in the game, and with a gesture of con-
tempt walked away. At the Anglo-American
Club, Berlin, Joe had a bout with Prince
Eitel and did some damage to the royal
countenance. Next morning he received an
urgent official tip to get out of the country
in twenty -four hours. He got. Now he
reckons he'll return via Broadmeadows.

A.I.F. UNIFORMS.
To the Editor fo The British-Australasian.
Sir, —In a recent number of the Bulletin ap- (
oeared the following:
“MiacAnzac” : When we get whacked over in
France our clothes are mostly torn and dirty, to ;
(Stay nothing of bloodstained. We come to hos-
pital in England, and when we are fit to go out j
we get an'.-Imperial uniform. If we want an
Australian outfit, we told to buy it. We get
a refund (if we are lucky and patient) <sf 14s,
on the tunic, nothing on the strides and hat*.
What is the matter? Why rub the dirt in be-
cause we are a few thousand miles from home
and wounded? A tunic alone costs £ 2 and up-
wards. The very lowest 'for a kind of one is
30s. For a hat the lowest price is 6s. 6d.,
strides 15s. That puts the purchase beyond most
of us. We are not ashamed of the Tommy rig-
out, but we reckon we ought to be issued with
our own. Call it swank, I don’t give a damn.
I'call it patriotism. The Scottie gets his kilts,
doesn’t he? Let’s have ours. We would if we
were home. Surely we are no less entitled to i
wear our own colours, so to speak, when we are
away.
Note. —The case albove-mentioned is not an
isolated one, and it is very hard on the men. They
have been fighting for months, and at last get
leave, and come to London. Their uniforms ar&
torn and dirty with the wear and tear of many
engagements, and they are ashamed to be seen
in London in that condition. Apart from this, it
is not a very good advertisement for the Common-
wealth that they should.
A large percentage of them have very little 1
money; they .have left wives and families behind, ,
and have allotted their money so that they have
only allowed themselves is. a day. How can
these men, out of what they are drawing, buy
themselves hew uniforms?
I have a case before me just now —a cousin is
coming over. A man who has lived all his life
in the Grampian mountains, and only allowed is.
a day for himself. He says, that he cannot be
seen in the clothes, he is wearing, and the first
thing he must do when he arrives in London is
to buy a new uniform. To do this he will have
to cable for money. He says his clothes are all
torn with the barbed wire entanglements, and are
very soiled.
Would it not be possible for one of the asso-
ciations to take this matter up, and, without let-
ting it appear to the boys as a matter of charity,
provide them with clean uniforms to wear during
their London leave? —Yours faithfully,
F AIRPLAY.
SIX DAYS’ HOLIDAY FOR ‘C.O.V
Life of Ease at Dartmoor with
Little Work to Do.
Six days’ holiday this Easter and their
railway fares paid to travel home and back
are some of the privileges accorded to the
700 conscientious objectors who are Living
their life of ease at Dartmoor.
The non-fighters who shirk work in the
trenches are mostly sturdy young men
from 19 to 29 years—just the age when
they could do good war work. But their
consciences debar them not only from risk-
ing their lives but also from doing morq
work than they are compelled.
Some disclosures of the leniency with
which these objectors are treated are made
by a correspondent of the Western Morn-
ing News, who says:
It has come as a shock to people of
the district, some of whose menfolk in
khaki have to remain on duty for long
periods without visiting home, that
these “ C.O.s ’’ get long leave.
Commenting on many of the men’s ob-
vious laziness, the correspondent states:
The crux of the whole matter is that
no effectual means of maintaining disci-
pline and of enforcing work upon the
shirker has been evolved. The agent or
manager is given little authority, and
at the most can only have an offender
out of the colony to be taken again by
the military or to be sent back to prison.
The stewards or foremen of the various
working parties have been elected by
the men themselves, and naturally as
they have to live with them and be of
them they are not anxious to fall foul
of any offender.
There is a rule at Princetown that these
men shall not smoke in working hours, but
that has practically gone by the board, and
those objectors who feel inclined to smoke
do so when and where they please.
Even in the cookhouse and bakehouse,
and even while food is being prepared,
“ fags ” are lit up, and the culprits take
no notice of words of expostulation. One
warder did express himself to the effect
that he thought smoking was not allowed
during work time, and •was met with the
rejoinder, “ I know it isn’t; but who is
going to stop us? ”
These conscientious fellows have now
petitioned against the working day of 91
hours, despite the fact that after the day’s
work has been done they are free to walk
out, make their private purchases, and take
their recreation.
A large number have bicycles and take
enjoyable spiffs on the moors. Others have
brought down their womenfolk to the
locality. With the arrival of spring they
will have a very enjoyable time.

THE KING’S MESSAGE TO
AUSTRALIANS.
THEIR PROUD RECORD.
The King looked on at a splendid spec-
tacle yesterday on the windy down above
Bulford, where he reviewed the Australian
troops now in training upon Salisbury
Plain His Majesty came to the great train- I
mg ground glowing with joy and pride over |
the progress of events in France, where j
Australian troops have so gloriously dis-
tinguished themselves.
Sunshine came with him too, and sun,
shine means much on Salisbury Plain to
those who inhabit its vast unsheltered
spaces. After bitter wintry weather yes- f
terday brought a touch of the joy of spring,
and the clear light in which the vast green
' spaces of rolling uplands open out into a
vision of splendour. It was a magnificent
setting for a magnificent spectacle. As to
the numbers of Australian troops in readi- j
ness upon the national training ground, it
is not desirable to speak too clearly. But
it was a proud day for the large party of
distinguished Australians who, with Mr.
Andrew Fisher, the High Commissioner,
had come to see the review.
They saw sweep past them saluting rank
after rank of the finest examples of the
human race the world can show. Troops
of all arms, horse, foot, and artillery,
cyclists, machine gunners, ambulance men,
transport and supply men, men of all the
branches and services that go to make up
an Army. But whatever their varying
. functions in the Australian forces, they
were all alike in the quality of physique.
There was scarcely a man among all their
thousands short enough to be called middle-
sized.
The King’s pleasure and pride at the
sight of them was obvious and unconcealed.
THE KING'S MESSAGE.
After the inspection the King sent the *
following message to Major-General Sir
Newton Moore, General Officer Command-
ing the Australian Forces in England:—
“ I am very glad to have had an oppor-
tunity of inspecting the various training :
units of the Australian Imperial Force,
and- lwish to express my satisfaction with I
the appearance of the fine body of men on
parade to-day
“You will, I know, acquit yourselves,
with credit when your time comes to re- ,
inferce those splendid Australian divisions i
at the front, whose deeds and fighting quali-
ties have won the highest praise.
“Do not forget your kinsman, who have
willingly given their lives for the Empire.
Emulate their example, and so preserve the
proud record made by them in the Great
War.”
Wirth's Circus
SUCCFSSFUL OPENING
Flushed with success" in New Zea-
land, Wirth’s Circus, which returned to
Australia by the Maheno on Monday, :
opened its Sydney season at the Hippo-
drome last night.
Foremost among the new features is *
the tight wire act of the Eddy Duo, Phil-
lip and Karolina. The turn is charac-
terised by grace of movement of the
performers, and the splendid dressing.
Karolina dances on the wire with more i
ease and grace than many dancers attain |
on the floor of a ballroom, and her
partner executes many • ‘‘stunts” that ,
are new to Sydney audiences. The piece |
de resistance, however, is provided by jj
Phillip, in a feat of which, it is claimed, |
he is the only performer in the world. \
He turns what is known in the profes- %
sion as a “flip-flap,” or back handspring
on the wire, as neatly as if he had a
stage to land on instead of a mere j
thread of steel. Another remarkable feat
is one in which he turns a back somer-
sault through a narrow hoop, landing
safely again on the wire*
Another clever act is that of Donzey,
a Chinese. In an inverted position he
lyuilds himself up on two piles of bricks
until he can no longer reach mere sup-
plies. His balancing, acrobatics, and
twirling of plates are performed with a
grace and skill which make his act a
pleasure to watch.
Of course there are the inevitable
clowns, headed by “Joey” Bannister, who
has just returned to the circus after long I
and arduous service at the front. !
Of performing animals there are many
Hons, dogs, and Danny Goslin and his
troupe of geese. During the week the
two lately-born lion cubs will be dis-
played in the vestibule of the Hippo-
drome. _
The Total A.I.F. Forces.
The Minister for Defence, speaking
in Melbourne recently, said that Aus-
tralia had sent 302,570 men to the front,
and 27,226 had returned. Twenty thou-
sand of these had been discharged, and
nearly 4,000 had re-enlisted ; while
10,000 were now oq the water.
In addition, over 27,000 men had been
sent away for munition work.
The casualty figures included dead,
26,000; wounded, 37,000; missing, 5,000;
sick, 26,000. The total number 'out of
action was 95,872.
RINGLING-B. & B. JOTTINGS
Big Show Playing to Fine Business All
Along the Line
Business with the Ringling Bros.’ and Bar-
ium & Bailey Combined Circus continues very
good. In fact, it has been so big since leaving'
Chicago that the management lias been com- ,
polled to add more ticket sellers, gate men and
ushers. At Watseka, 111., one performance
was given and thousands of people were turned
awav. Three performances were given at Kan-
sas City, Me., ore Sunday and two Monday
(Labor Day), to great business.
Mrs. Harry Hatfield and John Correa and
wife are new additions to the show. Charles
Bray has replaced Babe Taylor in the Jung
act' Jake Kogan left the show at Madison, Wis.,

trip to her home in Baraboo and returned at
Madison. Mabel Roberts is spending her vaca-
tion with her mother on the show. Mrs. Irving
Nelson joined the show at Rockford, 111., after
spending h»r vacation with her folks in the
New England States.
On account of giving a (Sunday performance
at Kansas City the Elks with the show had to
postpone the banquet and dance which was to
take rdace there at the Muelbach Hotel. The
Moose* Lodge on the show is progressing rapid-
ly, and nearly 300 members are in good stand-
ing. Secretary Frank Cook says “Boys, let’s*
make it ."00.” John Carson, who has become
quite popular in the ticket department, enter-
tained some friends at Milwaukee. At Rock-
ford Fred Schmnger. Col. Henry W. Rich and
M. C. Ward paid Charles Kanally a visit. O
D. Tibbetts, the oldtime showman, entertained
the writer at (Sioux Falls. /ion C. Rogers,
formerly of the B. & B. Show, visited Eddie.
Nemo at Milwaukee. At Terre Haute Major
Gagg took the following ' party to his home,
where a fine dinner was served: Fred Bradna
and wife John Agee and wife, Frank Mclntyre
and wife’ and Chick IBell. During the evening
Mr. Bradna sang a song Written by John Agee
that surprised the bunch, and Mr. Agee is some
entertainer himself. Mr. and Mrs. Major Gagg
witnessed the show and spoke very nicely of the
performance.
Walter and 'Paul Jung entertained their
mother anrl sister at Milwaukee. Joe (Kane,
who has been on the sick list, is back again.
Ollie Webb, the cookhouse caterer, has become
quite popular among the members of the show.
Poodles Hnnneford: Congratulations! The best
of luck to you and Grace is the wish of all.
Mickey McDonald’s sister paid him a visit at
Madison. Mable Kline was a welcome visitor
at Minneapolis. Joe I.ewis and wife saw

Bill Rice, of Rice-Dorman Shows, visited Chas.
Carroll and others at K. C. It wap rumored that
“Baby Doll” was killed in France, but Willie
Howe (Baby Doll) is still among the living.
Kenneth Maynard and Art Main wood are. going

can boast. He started out to achieve
his ambition when he was a lad of
seven in Switzerland and went thru
enormous, grinding hardships.
American audiences are consid-
ered the most hardboiled, or at least
the most critical of any nation, but
Grock made them laugh uproarious-
ly, and in the next moment had
them almost in tears.
It’s the gift he has, a universal
sort of gift, and to him the most
serious thing in his life and one of
those things impossible to explain.
If you don’t believe it is difficult
to make all nationalities laugh at
once listen to this one.
Young Lady to Station Master:
“Two to Loo.”
Station Master: “Pip, pip!”
Laugh .that one off. An English-
man would bust a gusset on it and
then chuckle for a week every time
he thought of it. I’ll never forget
the first time I watched a French
audience listen to its first jazz band.
There was a. moment of stunned si-
lence and then the crowd burst into
a gale of unrestrained laughter. To
them jazz was a huge musical joke,
and how many laughs do “blues”
get out of an Arperican audience?
Grock, who is soon going to New
York, had two huge difficulties to
overcome when he set out on his
youthful ambition. One was to de-
velop so keenly his sensibilities that
he could “feel" an audience the mo-
ment he left the wings. The other
was to find the common ground of
the risibles of all nations. How
he succeeded is an amazing story.
RTY-FIVE years ago he was
born at Neuehatel, Switzerland.
His father was a poor watch-
maker who, like the man in the
fairy tale, worked from morn till
night at his trade and made a bare
living for his family'.
The Swiss are famous for their
honesty and their watches, their
thrift and their yodeling. But who
ever heard of a Swiss joke? That
country has been very serious giving
the world its best time.
So when Grock first expressed his
wish to be one of the world’s fun-
makers his father looked at him
with a worried expression in his
eyes and said: “You will learn to
make watches.”
After thinking that over the boy
said: “All right.” For he figured if
he learned to make a watch he
could soon make a piano, and he
wanted a piano more than anything
else in the world as part of his
paraphernalia.
But he never made a piano, for
he never even learned where all the
wheels of a watch must go. But in
the solitude of his room little Grock
practiced making funny faces, twist-
ing his lean body into queer shapes,
and he learned to sing in a high
treble that had a strange way of
breaking just at the right moment
so that everybody laughed.
With that small beginning Grock
has made himself greater as a clown
than Paul Jury, the direct descend-
ant of the jester of Queen Eliza-
beth’s court, or Little Tich and the
famous Fratellini.
He had already been preparing
himself for his chosen profession for
five years when the first chance
came to him. A circus put up its
small tents in the town of Neuehatel.
The clown with the troupe was ill
and little Grock offered his services.
“What can you do?” the manager
gruffly asked.
Little Grock made a face. The
manager looked at him and
laughed, and then the manager
looked at him again and found
there was a lump in his throat,
tough as he was.
“What . . . !”
Little Grock grinned and started
singing. But the gruff manager in-
terrupted him with, “You’ll do,” and
offered him two or thfee pennies a
week.
OR THE whole summer little
Ty Grock traveled with them.
During the winter he returned
home to go to school, and kept up
his clown work after hours in
the town cafe, where he was al-
lowed to pass his hat and collect
whatever luck brought him.
The smell of the sawdust was in
his nostrils, however, and again he
went journeying with the circus.
All over Switzerland at first, the big
cities and the little dumps, Grock
made his funny faces, twisted his
body into outlandish shapes and
sang songs in his ridiculous voice.
He made people laugh, but not
heartily enough to suit him.
By the time he was 15 he knew
German and
French and set
himself to
studying what
made those two
nations laugh
the most.
Along with
studying the
sense of humor
of different na-
tions Grock be-
gan to improve
his act, to learn
new stunt s.
He had be-
come passion-
ately attached
to the accor-
d io n and
bought one on
the deferred
payment plan
from one of his
circus com-
panions. H e
also acquired a
violin.
H e earned
very little
money in those
days and
worked many
hours. The
only time he
had for prac-
ticing on his
musical instru-
ments was dur-
ing the night
when he should have been asleep.
“Night after night,” he relates, “I
used to creep away to some quiet
spot and practice for hours on the
accordion or violin. In some cart or
barn I would lie on the straw, shove
my feet thru the straps of my accor-
dion and try to play. The sounds I
first produced were weird enough to
kill a cat. I’ll never forget the first
time I played a real tune with my
feet on the accordion, tho. I leaped
out of the cart I had been lying in
and ran like mad to my room,
shouting with all my might. Evei’y-
one in the troupe thought I had
gone crazy, but I didn’t say any-
thing, because that would have con-
vinced them I was an idiot.”
Thru bitter winter nights, thru
days of little food and less shelter,
up and down strange countries
where unfriendliness was met as
often as a welcome, Grock jour-
neyed, and while he wasn't acting
he gave every moment he had to
studying. If it was not a new lan-
guage it was the accordion, or else
the violin, and when he had an op-
portunity he tried the piano and the
trombone, both with his hands and
with his feet. He tried twisting his
lean body into new and more gro-
tesque shapes and he practiced be-
GROCK
ing sad, so sad that the audience
would feel it and catch its breath.
He no longer had a warm house
in Neuehatel. He was a clown, a
funny laughmaker who belonged to
the world. And the pathos behind
it is that no matter how he felt he
must make others laugh, and if they
didn’t laugh it cut him more deeply
than any insult could. He must
make them laugh, all of them, so he
became more serious in his studies
than ever.
Cyr? 18 Grock joined an English
circus and received the mu-
V nificent sum o* three bob
(about 75 cents) a day for two per-
formances. He was compensated by
having a chance to learn another
language, seeing a new country and
hearing a different laughter.
He still kept up his nightly stud-
ies, practicing, as he .says, “a little
bit of everything till early dawn. ’
Then he would creep back to bed,
and pretend, when he was called,
that he had been asleep all night.
Then sud-
denly came
fame. It burst
upon him like
a flame. Every-
body was real-
izing that he
was laughing
his head off at
his antics, and
a s everybody
wants to laugh
as much as he
can, he was in
demand every-
where. In 1900
he was merely
a clown with
rare tricks of
his own. In
1927 he is a
clown par
excellence,
breaking rec-
ords in vaude-
ville houses all
over the world,
with a salary
.up in the thou-
sands and a
face that al-
most makes
you cry right
in the middle
of a big laugh.
Grock on the
stage is a gro-
tesque crea-
ture, with a
high bald head
and a monstrous month. He wears
baggy, super-baggy trousers and
carries, in an enormous portman-
teau, a tiny fiddle. Expressing con-
temptuous surprise at being asked
whether he can play the piano, he
plays a tune with his feet. Then he
thrusts them thru a chair and gives
a performance of extraordinary
brilliance on his accordion, his toes
moving as nimbly as anyone’s fin-
gers ever did.
It’s funny to watch his toes, it’s
sad to watch his face and it’s de-
lightful to listen to the music. He
combines nearly everything in that
apparently simple gesture.
Speaking of clowning, he says:
“You can learn most things, but you
cannot learn clowning. The Panta-
loons of this world must be born
Pantaloons to be successful. It is
no use for a would-be comedian to
ask if he can learn to be funny. He
must have funmaking in his nature.
It's a strange gift. If you were to
ask me to do something funny be-
tween my performances I couldn’t
possibly do it. I’m too serious. But
once on the stage I feel I’m just the
man. Sometimes, indeed, I don’t
know all that I am doing, it comes
so impromptu.” .
/OROCK is an actor, writer, corn-
poser and stage manager for ll
months of the year—then he
returns to the land of his birth to
renew his youth among his own
people, to rest by wandering about
in the mountains, or to spend peace-
ful hours on the lake in his own
motorboat, to read without paying
attention to the “call”.
Grock is slightly above medium
height, a fine healthy man in the
early years of middle life. Yet when
he first appears on the stage he
looks almost a dwarf, a weird old
man from—who knows where?
Nothing bothers Grock, nothing
ever has. Today he is rich, can live
where and how he pleases, so he
lives simply. He could afford sev-
eral chauffeurs, but prefers to di'ive
his own car, even in Paris. 'He has
none of the caprices usually ac-
quired by those have been
humbly born and suddenly become
rich. Everything new interests him,
and he works with the same en-
thusiasm that he did 33 years ago.
His act changes almost nightly, and
his partner never knows beforehand
what his musical program is going
to be. ,
While playing at the Palace Music
Hall in Paris the winter of 1926-’27,
one evening just as he was ready to
go on Mrs. Grock came to inform
him that his partner had disap-
peared. Any other star would have
been wild at the thought of his act
being ruined for that evening. Not
so with Grock. When his wife
fearfully asked him what he was
going to do he looked at her with
his rare smile and announced that
she would put on her evening froclc
and go on with him.
Mrs. Grock had a very lovely
voice, so, aided by that and the
quick ingenuity of both of them,
the act passed off beautifully and
no one in the audience was aware
of the improvised change in Grock’s
number. The next day a new part-
ner was found.
When asked if the incident had
not annoyed him Grock replied that
they liked him at the Palace and
that whatever he did was all right.
/O ROOK speaks seven languages,
and outside of his early school-
ing he has never had a lesson in
any one of them. He plays five mu-
sical instruments well and has never
had a music lesson in his life.
A superior intelligence, a musical
ear and the intense desire to make
something of himself, to get to the
top of the mountain, have been his
only masters, the only ones to help
him over the difficult spots of his
early career when he could not earn
sufficient to pay for a room and to
buy the food needed to feed the
growing body.
In the autumn of 1920 he played
a short engagement in New York.
Since then Europe has never been
■willing to spare him long enough for
him to make a return trip. For the
last two summers he has played a
month’s engagement in Berlin,
breaking records each time. But
this year he is expected to be in
America again.
“Laugh and the world laughs with
you; weep and you weep albne.”
With Grock that proverb does not
hold good, for he never laughs, yet
the world laughs because of him, a
heartfelt laughter that frequently—•
by the supremacy of his art —
merges into tears.
Grock accompanied us to the sta-
tion where we were to take a train
for a Mediterranean port. “Good-
by,” he said, “I’ll see you in your
own country in the spring.” And
as we looked into his sad face we
.felt an inclination to cry—to cry
from looking into the face of Grock,
the funniest clown in the world.


Around the World with Tiny Town —By Beaumont Smith
Arrival at Capetown.
We sailed for Africa by the “Per-
sic.” It \yas a long, tedious trip,
and we were not sorry when it was
over. We touched Durban first, and
remained there two days whilst the
boat coaled. Durban is a most Cos-
mopolitan city—white and black,
Gnglish, Dutch, German, Malay,
Hindoo, every nationality under the
sun. The sea-shore of Durban
would be an eye-opener for our
Manly, Coogee and St. Kilda Coun-
cils. Attractively laid out on the
foreshores are hotels, cinema shows,
baths, rotundas, side-shows, gardens,
cafes. Of course, it is not a Coney
Island for noise, bustle, excitement, j
but, architecturally, Durban beach
takes a lot of beating. Durban’s!
great season is in the winter. Then j
thousands of families come down
from Johannesburg and the interior,
and it turns itself into a pretty, gay
city.
Three days later, in the early
morning, we sighted Table Moun-
tain. There are few more imposing 1
things in the world than Table Moun-
tain. The Bay of Naples, with j
Vesuvius in the background (even
in eruption) does not beat it. Table
Mountain, with a gossamer of clouds j
over its head, brought by a sou’- j
easter, is an almost indescribable !
sight. Our season was one of three;
weeks, and was very successful
The only drawback was we struck
the windy season. I’ve never known j
such wind. Capetown invariably :
suffers from these sou’-easters from
November till March. The sign
that one is coming is the pouring:
of clouds over the top of the moun-
tain like an immense waterfall.
Then the wind comes, and it blows
everything—dirt, stones, tins, hats,
or anything that hasn’t got an an-
chor on it. You take no more notice
of hats flying about the streets in
Capetown than you do of loose
chaff. Capetown people tell me hat
catching is a pretty good sport. You
wait at a corner, and you take
your pick of hats as they fly by.
When you’ve chosen one that suits
you, you put it firmly on your head
and then just let your own old one
go. They call a Capetown sou’-
easter the “Capetown doctor,” as
it is supposed to blow away all
disease. I know this, that if a
heavy sou’-easter comes up in the
late afternoon, it blows a horrible
draft through your theatre. People
don’t like to venture out, for apart
from losing their hats, and women
having to put heavy weights on the
hem of their skirts, there is a
danger of windows being blown out,
and the glass falling on pedestrians
below. I remember whilst we were
in Capetown, Herr Pagel’s circus
was blown down by a sou’-easter.
You remember Herr Page!, the
strong man, and Madame Pagel, the
lion tamer, who were out here with
W’rth’s Circus years ago. They had
their own circus in Africa, up till
the beginning of the war. But sud-
denly the military authorities
swooped down on them and interned
most of their company. When last
T saw her, Madame Pagel still wore
huge ostrich feathers, and fed great
lumps of meat to the lions and
tigers during the interval in full
view of the audience.
Capetown’s surroundings are fine.
One of the grandest drives in the
world is round the Mountain. The
coast of Italy, and the Riviera don t
leave it far behind in natural beauty.
Up the side of the mountain glisten
clumps of silvery colored trees.
There grow the famous silver leaves,
which you have received from an
African friend some Xmas or other,
no doubt, with the Merry Xmas writ-
ten on it. Cecil Rhodes’ old home
(Groot Schuur), with its noble
memorial, stand out amongst the
oaks on the mountain side. A trip
through the grounds is of great in-
terest. Not the least interesting
thing we saw in the small Zoo was
a stork with a wooden leg. I sup-
pose broke the other falling off a
chimney.
The Tour Starts.
Our tour of. Africa started
at Paarl, which, with Stellenbosch,
is about the most Dutch town in
Cape Colony. This is a most pic-
turesque spot, and like every other
Dutch town in Africa, the Dutch re-
formed Church was the finest building
there. We discovered, even before we
reached Africa, that to successfully
tour that country, it would be neces-
sary for us to travel tents with us,
as halls were everywhere too small.
Accordingly, we brought a tent 145
feet by 90 feet, and another 60 feet
square, with us. We all had the
noble ambition of keeping Tiny
Town absolutely white, and accord-
ingly I engaged white men solely be-
fore' leaving Capetown. One was
drunk before the train started, so
was left behind. To erect two new
tents, which had never been up be-
fore, in a temperature over 100 in
the shade, with a new staff, which
was half the size it should have
been, was no easy job. Hundreds
of niggers stood by ready to help if
they were asked; Put nobody would
do that, as Tiny Town was a white
show, and was going to keep white.
Men began to drop with the heat,
but the rest plugged on, and by sun-
set things were about fixed. No
sooner were they fixed thap it be-
came evident that we would have to
start at once if we wanted to get
things down in time to leave by the
4 a.m. train for Worcester. So
evervthing that could be taken
down during the performance was
demolished. By working themselves
almost to a standstill, the white
staff had the railway trucks loaded
two hours after the train hacl passed
through. Duckily there was an-
other train, so we got away. Just
as the train was pulling out, the
boss tent-man came to me with
two niggers and broke the news that
he had had to accept their help. The
White Tiny Town idea exploded.
“Do you need them to go on with
you?” I asked.
“I’m afraid so,” said the worn-
out boss tentman, named Charlie.
“These white men we've got are too
lazy.”
“Alright,” I said. “Jump into
the truck, boys.”
And the two Cape boys jumped
in, and we never regretted having
departed from our ideals.
How We Travelled.
We travelled Africa with a saloon
with forty-four sleeping berths, a
covered truck for the ponies, and
three other small trucks for our
accessories. Thd niggers slept in
the open trucks, beneath the bun-
dles of tent canvas. The white tent
hands mostly made their home in
the horse-box. rigging up hammocks
made out of tarpaulins. We had an
orchestra of seven Germans, and
they took up the better part of two
compartments. At this period of
our tour there were not more than
four purely English people travell-
ing with the show. The midgets
were nearly all Austrian or German,
the band was German, and the boss
tentman and his assistant were Ger-
man, the grooms were German and
French, and the tent hands were nig-
gers and Dutcn-Africans.
Most of the time on that African
tour was spent on the train. It
soon became evident that there was
no time to go regularly to hotels
for meals, so gradually spirit and
primus stoves made an appearance in
the compartments, and many of the
company became capable cooks. The
only objection I had to that German
band was that it seemed to live on
garlic; the scent of garlic isn’t a
thing one can keep to oneself.
Travelling in Africa is very com-
fortable. Australia suffers chiefly
because of its various gauges. The
rolling stock on its inter-State ex-
press trains is some of the best in
the world. Its expresses are perhaps
faster than the African, but unless
one pays an extra ten shillings for
a sleeping berth, the comforts and
conveniences are not equal to the
African trains. Africa is a country
of distances. So is Australia; but
in the former one can go thousands
of miles without changing trains;
but in the latter, 400 miles without
disembarking, or changing to another
gauge, is quite unusual. In Africa,
sleeping bunks are provided not only
in first-class carriages free, but also
in second and third. Bedding for a
trip of any length is supplied for
half-a-crown. On the dining cars,
meals are cheaper than in Australia,
and wines are obtainable on the
trains.
Accidents.
At Worcester, it was hotter than
it had been the previous day at Paarl.
So hot, in fact, that it was impos-
sible to get the tents up in time for
matinee —men were collapsing all
round. The king-pole was just be-
ing raised when the pegs came out
and down crashed the pole, and nar-
rowly missed crushing some boys, who
were playing about underneath. Un-
happily, this was not the only acci-
dent. As our acetylene lighting
nlant was being loaded on'to a wag-
gon to go to the station after the
Show, it somehow exploded, and
Charlie, the boss tentman, and an-
other man were very .badly injured.
Almost everyone else was at the
train, which was waiting to leave.
Sqmeone brought the news that there
ha<j been a bit of an accident, and
that; the two men were only slightly
burned, and would be up from the
ground in a few minutes. But when
the train steamed out for Laings-
burg, there was no sign of them,
and we had the pleasant prospect to
go to bed with of no experienced
man to take charge of the tent, and
no lighting plant. It was not for
some days that news reached us of
the two injured men. They were
very badly burned, and it was nearly
three months before they were them-
selves again.
An angel in the guise of Andreas
Zaynard came along and offered to
take charge of the tent till Charlie
was well again. That was one diffi-
culty overcome, but the lighting was
another very serious matter. Laings-
burg is a little, dilapidated town,
dumped between two rugged ranges.
The only building that had an acety-
lene plant was the Dutch Reformed
Church. Thither we went, and be-
ing about mid-day, found the Dutch
parson in bed having his customary
noon-day rest. He talked to us in
his night-shirt through a crack in
the door, and we found the acetylene
plant was built into a w|lUndjo
could not be removed. The onl>
thing left to do was to scour the
district, and borrow all the hanging
lamps there were No has
ever had a collection of antique
lamps such as we gathered.
bably the good house we had was due
to the owners of the lamps coming
to see how their lamps compared
with their neighbor’s.
The Nigger Staff.
We gathered several splendid
specimens of Kaffirs for our staff
here. One giant, named Jacob who
drove some thirty iron (fou
feet long), with a sledge-hammer,
without the suspicion of fatigue,
commenced his engagement by acci-
dentally crushing his mate s foot
with a blow from his hammer. The
pay for niggers for this work is
about three shillings per day. out
of which they get their own _ food-
or “scoff,” as they call it. Foi the
first few days, we fed the niggeis
out of our own larder, but we soon
discovered that niggers did not ex-
pect tinned pork and baked beans,
salmon. asparagus and tinned
ovsters. Maurice Ralph, our trea-
surer. found he was simply develop-
ing into a niggers’ valet, and was
at their beck and call at all houis
for “scoff, boss.” He used to go to
sleep hearing niggers cries tor
“scoff” and would wake m the
morning seeing them patting then'
stomachs outside his window, the
meaning of which could not be mis-
interpreted. So it was arranged thej
should buy their own scoff. and
much worry was saved thereoy.
This country, that we were now
in was the famous Karoo-hundreds
of miles of barren-looking land, with
weird, rocky, flat-topped kopjes. Much
of the land is of a good quality,
but its rainfall is scanty, and it is
given over mostly to goats, sheep
and ostriches. The sun-set effects
in the Karoo are grand, but a coun-
try cannot live on sunset effects
When it does rain in the Karoo, it
seems to rain so hard, that all seed
and young plant life is washed away.
What a disappointment Africa must
have been to the early trekkers
when, after passing through the
fertile coast lands, they came upon
the interminable Karoo.
Beaufort West is well planted with
trees, and is a good imitation of an
oasis in a desert. Of course, the
Dutch Reformed Church rises above
everything else in the neighborhood.
Many cool, pleasant-looking homes
there are. But there, if the residents
do not take a Measure in their homes
there is nothing much else m the
district to interest them. Here, four
of our niggers went into a shop to
buy a pound of grapes, and it ap- f
pears that when the shopkeeper’s *
back was turned, one could not re-
sist the temptation of stealing three
brightly-colored silk scarfs. We
knew nothing of it till a threatening
letter arrived from the shopkeeper.
A court-martial was held on the sta-
tion at Hutchinson, and after a long
cross-examination, a Cape boy (Wil-
liam) gave in, and the three hand-
kerchiefs were found in three sonar- ;
ate places in the trucks. William
was given one chance more, but two
days later he had to be dropped for
drunkenness.
The War Country.
We arrived at Victoria West about
10.30 a.m. The station is in the mid-
dle of an inhospitable plain with no
town in sight. However, on the
side of a high kopje, formed out of
white-washed stones, is the name
Victoria West. We were met by the
mayor and citizens, who conveyed us
to the town in motor cars. We were
horrified to see the accommodation
that had been provided for the con-
veyance of our tent, etc., to the
town. Two old four-wheeled wag-
gons drawn by teams of tiny, un- .
derfed, coarse-haired donkeys. We
laughed at the idea of these little
things shifting our stuff, but the
Dutchman in charge told us to wait
and see. He piled the waggons up
to a great height, and away went
the team with comparative ease.
The following two days were days
of travelling. During the first we
passed through much of the war-
country roupd De Aar, and south of
the Orange River. We saw the
graves of hundreds of soldiers, most
of the men who did not die in bat-
tle, but perished of enteric and tv-
phoid fever whilst guarding the rail-
way lines in the thousands of block-
houses. Many of them never fired
a shot at the enemy, but their work
was just as-noble and just as bene-
ficial, if not as picturesque, as those
who died at Spion Kop and Majes- )
fontein.
We spent several hours at De Aar
Junction. Naanpoort Junction and
Rosmead Junction, waiting for train
connections. Thev all consist solely
of railway cottages, and refreshment
rooms. Middleburg was our next
town. It is well laid out. well plan-
ted, prides itself with having one
of the biggest shows in Africa, and
was formerly a military camp, but
the camp is now turned into an agri-
cultural college.
A Whirlwind.
Here we had our first meeting
with an African whirlwind. The
matinee was just being opened when
there was a terrible roar, rushing of
wind, and cloud of dust. The tent
began to bulge, and the quarter
poles danced like a ballet. It looked
as though the tent was going. An-
dreas Zeynard cried out to everyone
to rush outside. Everyone made a
movement that way except Tom
Thumb. He was just changing his
clothes, and was naked except for
his trousers, which were down round
his ankles, and served as a pair of
hobbles when he attempted to escape.
Blinded with dust, he staggered out
of the dressing room, crying for help.
In the confusion no one noticed him
till the whirlwind had passed on;
then he was seen standing like a dis-
tressed and portly cupid, with eyes
closed and holding out his arms for
succor. Christian, one of our atten-
dants, grabbed him, and putting his
coat about his little naked body,
bore him back to the dressing room.
At Graft Reinet, we could see so
many whirlwinds wandering about
the plains that we decided to give
up tents for a couple of days, and
return to halls. Graff Reinet has
a palatial new hall —palatial for an
African country town. Its council-
lors guard it like a woman guards
her first child, and it took many
hours of canvassing before we could
get permission to use our ponies on
the stage. Those same ponies had
been on the London Coliseum stage,
the New York Hippodrome, Sydney
Town Hall, but this did not count
with the councillors of Graff Reinet.
It was at Graff Reinet that a fight
between a circus and niggers took
place, and resulted in two niggers
being shot. What the exact cause
was we cannot say, but if it was
because the niggers had interfered
with the ropes of the tent, then no
doubt the shooting was justified. Sev-
eral times lately we had had ropes
cut —one rope being the main one
that held up the big pole. Luckily
on this occasion other ropes had
been put on, or in all probability
the pole would have fallen and per-
haps killed several people. Things
became so serious with us with this
continual cutting of ropes, that our
watchmen were given authority to
expel anyone who ventured inside
our ropes as roughly as they liked.
Should they repeat the trespass, then
they did so at their own risk.'
At a picture show the other day,
I saw a comedy Triangle picture
dealing with a circus. At the end of
it the comedy villain cuts the main
rope of the tent and down crashes
the tent, and its supporting pole.
People were to be seen floundering
all over the ship, and the audience
round me were screaming with
laughter. But it struck me how un-
funny such a happening was in real
life. It would have meant more
claims for injuries sustained and
compensation than a big railway ac-
cident. Poor Phil and George Wirth
know all about the worry cf .the
circus game. There is an everlast-
ing fear of an accident —tent fall-
ing down, or the seating collapsing.
They’ve had a pretty good dose of
it. We only had one claim for com-
pensation in Africa, and that was by
a man who was hit on the head by
a falling- sign.
Ostrich Country.
Graff Reinet to Willowmore meant
a day lost in travelling. On this
branch line from Klipplat to Willow-
more and Oudtshoorn there are con-
tinual washaways. Trains were held
up for days just before we came
along, and no sooner had we got out
of the district than floods came
again, and communication was cut
off for several days. Willowmore is
another typical Karootown, with a
market square, a newspaper with a
Dutch name. Between Willowmore
and Oudtshoorn the country im-
proves wonderfully. The railway
runs along a wonderfully fertile val-
ley, clothed in lucerne, on which
thousands of ostriches are engaged
at their daily occupation of growing
feathers. Oudtshoorn is a haven of
peace after the barren Karoo. With
us it was five days of rest and com-
fort. Most of that comfort was ex-
perienced at John Bowden’s Queen’s
Hotel, one of the homeliest iy Africa.
As someone described it, an Eng-
lish home with a touch of Oriental
luxury and comfort. Oudtshoorn is
a town that has grown into import-
ance of late years through the
- ~ _■ ■ tJTi ’ - *•', +<+i - - f
ostrich feather industry. Since we
were there the r&ilw&y to M.oss£ii
Bay has been completed, and this
pleasant town is much more acces-
sible. A new theatre was also
building, and Oudtshoorn should be-
come a very good show toyvn. All
the African towns I have mentioned
up to now were worth anything from
£BO to £l5O a performance to a tent
show such as ours.
Nowadays, one ostrich farm alone
in the district has from 6000 to 7000
birds. This belongs to Mess.rs. Poti-
ger Bros. The district is a district of
rich men, the biggest income in the
district being about £50,000. This is
not all derived from ostriches —
some comes from mixed farming.
Ground lately has been sold near
Oudtshoorn for as much as £750 a
morgen (two acres).
Most people have an idea that an
ostrich is a timid bird, that hides
its head in the sand when you go
near it, or lays eggs with badly
painted pictures on them. That the
ostrich is not a shy, modest biro
a certain cinematograph operator
will tell. Ho was under the popular
impression that they hid their
blushes in the earth, so ventured
into a paddock near Oudtshoorn
where some hen birds were sitting.
He did not have time even to focus
up wl en a cyclone of feathers, dust,
and beaks struck him. He ran as
he had never run before, and left
his camera to the tender mercies of
the wild cock ostriches, who took
quite a lot of revenge out of it.
About Feathers.
An ostrich is first plucked when
six months old, then again six
months later. The best feathers are
got from a birl when from 21 to 31
years old. Birds are plucked three
times in two years, and an average
plucking yields about £6 At Oudt-
shoorn about seven birds can be kept
on two acres, but the average in mos.
other parts is less than this. The
greatest mortality amongst birds is
from birth to six months, and from
ten to fifteen months old. Ostrich
farmers told us that it is the easiest
farming in the world when you get
accustomed to it. Lucerne is the
chief food, but an ostrich will eat al-
most anything. But plenty of crushed
bone and grit are essential. The har-
der the stone the better ostriches like
it Crushed flint is an ideal dish for
an ostrich. When quilling an ostrich
one has to be very careful. If it
is pulled out crooked, the new fea-
thers will grow crooked. The chief
trouble with ostriches is the ostrich
fly and lice. With the irritating lice,
the bird, with its hooked beak, bites
at the lice and injures the young fea-
thers. A good cock bird is wortn
£lOO, but some birds have been soru
for as much as £lOOO. The usual
price for a chick one month old is

Pardon this departure into figures
and facts. We found it information
that interested us, and trust it will
likewise interest you. We found the
mavor, Mr. Swemmer, and many of
the' residents most hospitable, and
when the time came for leaving
Oudtshoorn, we were loath to go.
Feathers we were given in dozens,
and everywhere kindness was thrust
on us from all sides.
An Interesting Story.
Before continuing our tour to Port
Elizabeth, this story told us at Oudt-
shoorn is worth telling. It illus-
trates the growth of the district,
the astounding increased land values,
and the simplicity of the Dutch-Afri-
can. It was early in the ostrich
farming boom, and a wealthy syndi-
cate offered an old farmer an enor-
mous sum for his farm. The old man
agreed to sell, but conditionally that
he be paid in gold, and not by che-
que—a thing he knew little about
and did not trust. The money was
to be brought to his farm, so accord-
ingly several bank officials, with the
gold on a waggon, set out with an
escort. The old man welcomed them
on the step, and ushered them into
the dining room, where the table
had been cleared for the counting.
The bank clerks sat on one side
busily putting the money into £lOO
piles The old man sat opposite,
with his arms folded on the table.
All through the * morning the count-
ing and jingling went on. Now and
again the clerks glanced across at
the stolid, motionless old Dutchman
opposite, who gazed fixedly at the
piles of gold. At length the work
was done and the bank officials rose.
“Well,” said the head clerk; “you
will find it correct, Mr. , I
think.”
The old man made no movement.
They thought, maybe, he had fallen
asleep, as most Dutchmen in Africa
do at mid-day, so someone shook
him lightly by the shoulder, and
then his head fell limply on to his
arms. He was dead !


EIIZABETH.
By >rt Elizabeth drains a fairly
7 ge tract of country of its pro-
Vducts, but this tract of country will
be considerably reduced by the com-
pletion of the Oudtshoorn-Messel
Bay railway. One of the most im-
pressive thing's I saw in Africa was
a piece of statuary. It is at Port
Elizabeth, and is a noble statue erec-
ted to the horses that perished in the
war.
‘ The greatness of a nation con-
sists not so much in the number of
its people, or the extent of its ter-
ritory, as in the extent and justice
of its compassion.”
This is the inscription on this
noble statue, which represents a
kneeling soldier with a bucket cf
water in his hands, from which his
horse stands drinking. At the base
of the statue three jets of water
11 ow from the rock, and these always
keep a trough full of water for pass-
ing animals. We saw this fountain-
statue under most favorable circum-
stances, early one morning. As we
passed, an old horse was drinking
the cool clear water. We wondered
if the old horse knew.
On Sunday afternoon, several of
our colored boys were arrested. It
appears* that they were crossing the
railway line, when they were all
seized and thrown into gaol along
with a couple of score of other
natives. They were crossing the
line to go to the beach where they
intended to bathe. The average Cape
Colony nigger has so little desire
to wash, that it seems almost a
crime to prevent him when he gets
the good intention.
Heavy rains came on the fourth
day of our Port Elizabeth season,
and it rained almost continuously for
two days. This was the commence-
ment of about two weeks of damp-
ness. The latter part of our sea-
son at Port Elizabeth was complete- 1
ly spoiled. Anyhow, Port Elizabeth
has a bad reputation as a show town,
and big companies frequently cut it
out.
Floods.
Grahamstown is essentially an
English town, as the fact that a
memorial erected to the memory or
146 men who died in the Boer War
will serve to snow. It rests in a
fertile valley amidst well-wooded
hills, and the climate is most ex-
hilarating. In the early days,
Grahamstown was the scene of many
big fights with the natives, but now
it is as peaceful as an average Eng-
lish village. Between Grahamstown
and Alicedale Junction, the load on
one of our trucks was so high that
it struck the top of a tunnel. We
heard the terrible crash in our
saloon, and at the next station, great-
ly fearing that some of our niggers,
who slept in the truck, had been
killed or injured, I rushed along to
see. I called them all by name, but
got no answer, so we were then all
certain they had been swept off.
However, after a chorus of calls,
they tumbled out from their nests
under the woodwork and tents, rub-
bing their eyes. They knew noth-
ing of what had occurred, and cared
less. When someone said: “We
thought you had been killed, Wil-
liam,” the native grinned and replied,
“You can’t kill a Kaffir, boss.”
Cradock was reached in a thunder-
storm, and we left it in another
one. We got our round-top tent up
nicely, but that is more than we can
say about the getting of it down. Dur-
ing our final performance a thunder-
storm came on that swamped the
whole countryside. We were pitched
on a very bad piece of ground, and
the flood waters from the neighbor-
-
ing roads and paddocks all came
through our tent. After half an
hour, the ring was the only dry spot
in the tent. A stream of water,
several inches deep, coursed through
the whole width of the tent. People
had to stand on chairs, and The mid-
gets were carried into the ring on
big men’s shoulders.
In On a Pass.
It was impossible to break down
our tent in the thunderstorm, so,
leaving men behind to take it down
when the weather cleared, we went
on to Somerset, where we erected
another of our tents. Apart from its
natural beauty, a thing that interes-
ted us was its newspaper, which
was called “The Midget.” It is said
that in Somerset East is an old Eng-
lish woman, related to nobility, who
lives at the Kaffir camp. Her rela-
tions are continually sending for her
to come to England, but the story
says she intends to end her days
amongst the Kaffirs. In the street
the day we arrived there a resident
pointed out a local celebrity to me.
“He’s a man who will see your show
to-night,” said the resident. “He is
sure to buy six 6s. tickets.” Sure
enough the affluent celebrity did
come, and as he approached, I said
to our cashier, “Get six six-shilling
tickets readv.” However, the cele-
brity walkeu past the pay box, and
inside—he came on a press ticket.
Sunday was spent on the train be-
tween Somerset East and King Wil-
liam’s Towns, passing through Kaffir
country. Naked Kaffir children
chased the train for miles when it
was on the up-grade, bent on glean-
ing anything passengers might dis-
card.
King Williams Town is another
essentially English town, and our
business during our two days was
enormous. There were few things
of any special interest in the town
excepting the picturesque tribe
known as the Red Blanket Kaffirs.
The color is hardly red —it is really
a tomato color. They buy ordinary
white blankets, and dye them them-
selves. The Red Blanket Kaffir is
a subject some artist would do well
to exploit.
Fast London.
We came down to the Coast again
at East London, and it was a wel-
come change after the hot interior.
It is a very progressive seaport,
Wing the outlet for perhaps the fin-
est arOf country in Africa —the
Transkei. Some of the surround-
ings are very picturesque, especially
the Buffalo river, the natural garden
reserves on ifs banks, and the beach,
one part of which is set aside by
the municipality for camps, and dur-
ing the summer season hundreds or *
people from up country reside there.
Five days’ rest put us in a fit state
to begin our 1000-mile journey into
the interior. We would see no more
ocean till we came out at Durban.
For its size, East London is re-.
garded as an indifferent show town.
We stayed one night at a little
town called Cathcart, with its pure
fresh air, and Government forest re-
serve. South Africa is naturally a
treeless country, and it was refresh-
ing to see a forest of dark pines, and
lighter Australisfn gums. As the
annual show was to happen two days
later, everyone predicted bad busi-
ness for us, but our tent was well
filled, most of the audience bringing
lanterns with them to see their way
home. Some serious-minded person
told us we ought to have arranged
to have come when it was full moon,
is several farmers outside the town
drive in then.
Wliat’s Asparagus?
At Catheart we set out to replen-
ish our store of tinned goods, but
soon found it impossible. Stale dis-
colored salmon, and tinned beef was
all we could get. I thought it hard-
ly likely, but I asked the shop-
keeper, “Have you any asparagus?”
“Any what?” he asked.
“Asparagus.”
“What’s that?”
It was a hard thing to explain.
We tried, anyway, but it was not con-
vincing. But suddenly the store-
keeper had a brilliant idea, “Ah, is
it anything you get from the chem-
ist. His place is two doors away.”
Check-mated.
Queenstown is one of the few
places we have visited that we do
not look back upon with any great
pleasure. It was not Queenstown’s
fault —it was Circumstance, and our
own mistaken judgment. The Queens-
town Gala had some weeks pre-
viously wired us an offer to appear
under their auspices. Negotiations
fell through, and we decided to carry
out our original idea of playing on
our own responsibility. Our advance
agent went to the town, and attempt-
ed to get a location for our tent,
but, strange to say, there was not
one available. It soon became evi-
dent that the Gala committee (which
was composed of almost every man
in the town) had no intention of let-
ting us in at all unless we played
on the gala ground. We even tried
to buy a block of ground, but they
check-mated us there, and finally,
having no other town booked, we
were obliged to play on the gala
ground, and permit them to charge
everyone who came to Tiny Town
a shilling admission before they could
reach our entrance. It was a de-
liberate hold-up, but we had to sub-
mit. Our prices were 65., 45., 35., and
25., but with the Is. extra charged at
the gate, they were Is., 55., 45., and
3s. We opened up to over £lOO, but
played down to almost nothing on
the last night. On the opening
night, at about seven fifteen, a hail-
storm came on and lasted for over
two hours. We waited till it was
over, and started the performance at
half-past nine.
Newspaper Explanations.
Molteno, the next stop, is a little
coal-mining town. We played many
small towns, but it was not the
towns that we altogether depended
on —the farmers from up to fifty
miles around would drive in in their
Cape carts to witness the show. Vv e
saw by the local paper that an al-
leged pantomime, ‘ Robinson Crusoe,”
had been staged a mgnt or two be-
fore, “but me attendance was not
as good as it might have been ow-
ing to our cricketers having gone
to somewhere-or-other that day.” We
could not help seeing the humor of
about fifteen cricketers and support-
ers accounting for a scanty audi-
ence. The report mentioned another
great calamity: “Owing to the rail-
ways over-carrying the gorgeous
scenery for the pantomime, the scenic
sine was not as good as it might
have been.” What a good old thing
the railway is to blame; but one of
these days the worm will turn and
say there was no scenery at all m
tne company s possession to be car-
ried on
Father of 23.
Aliwal North is on a branch line,
right on the banks of the Orange
River, which divides Cape Colony
from The Orange River Colony.
When the war broke out, one of the
first movements of the Boers was
to come across the river and occupy
the town, which they held for four
months. The town is well laid out,
with many nice homes, well watered
and planted streets, a pleasant park,
and excellent hot water springs,
which are some of the best in the
world for rheumatism and kindred
complaints. Aliwal North is an ideal
health resort, and it is regrettable
it is not advertised more. The. rea-
son, we are told, is lack of money.
It has a racecoure, golf links, hot
springs, parks and two fine rivers
at its doors. When Aliwal people
rouse themselves, and negotiate a
loan and boom their district, it will
become an extremely popular spot.
At Aliwal North the city inspector
is said to be the father of 23 chil-
dren. He does not call them by any
names—each has a number. We had
Number 14 acting for us as a ticket-
t3/k6r.
We heard of a neighboring magis-
trate here, part of whose duties was
to visit Pondoland at intervals and
try native cases —if there were any,
which was seldom. When he was
fatigued with city life, and felt like
a few days’ shooting, he would wire
this distant post, “Have you any
cases?” If they replied, “No,” he
would wire this emphatic order,
“Get one, arriving Tuesday.” So he
would spend a few days shooting, and
incidentally try the case.
War Memorials.
Little Burghersdorp, with its
charming wooded streets, pictures-
que market square, is a model Dutch
dorp. It rests between two ranges
of hills, and is naturally confined to
a limited area. There are few vacant
lots in the town, and the town is all
town, and in some 'ways resembles
strongly a Continental village. Be-
tween Burghersdorp and Springfon-
tein we passed through much war
country—country that we sped
through in a few hours, took the
British troops many weary months
to penetrate.
Almost every town in Cape Colony
has its memorial to its soldiers that
fell in the war, but there seems an
absence of similar things m the
Dutch towns of the two late repub-
lics Some of the memorials are very
beautiful, but the most noble of all
is the horse memorial at Port Eliza-
beth. Another great statue that we
did not see, but which should be
erected in some central part of the
Union, represents the British and
Dutch Afrikanders clasping hands
over the bodies of their countrymen.
Springfontein is e. scattered dorp,
whose only excuse for existing is
that it is a railway junction. Here a
Dutch woman endeavored to hold us
up again for £6 for the hire of a wag-
gon for three or four hours to move
some of our stufi. \V e eventually
securea a nigger with a cart tor
under £l.
Bloemfontein.
Bloemfontein we expected to find
the hot-bed of the mutch, nut were
surprised to observe it was becoming
very English. .English shops and signs
were everywhere, and most people
seemed to talk English. There are
tew towns in the world with the
small population of bioemiontem
(.15,000 ’ whites) that have such
magnificent buildings. But wnat will
be the future of Bloemfontein? The
Orange River Colony, with peace and
wise laws, should grow into a great
and prosperous part of the Empire,
its plunge into a disastrous war,
from which it couiu reap nothing,
simply out of pure sentiment ior its
neighbor, the Transvaal, is some-
thing no otner nation can ever under-
stand. One can understand some ot
those iri econciiaihe uack - veldt
Orange Coiony Boers chating under
the soft yoke of .British control when
they think of what they did out or
unselfishness, or Diindness, and bad
statesmanship. South Airica is be-
coming slowly but surely English. tt
cannot become other. Strive as the
old Dutch may to keep their chil-
dren Dutch by teaching Dutch in the
schools, they cannot obliterate the
nundred and one English influences
everywhere, tnhuences that are not
orought aoout hy .English conspn-
acy; Dor instance, advertising
Hoardings are one mass of English
posters, and printing, and nothing-
can prevent a child looking at these,
repetition is the best means of im-
pressing a thing on anyone’s mind,
and if you are toid often enough
that Jones’ Corn cure really cures
corns, you win believe it eventu-
ally. - .
Erom Bloemfontein we went VV est
to Beaconsfield- —a suourb of Kimber-
iey. Here it was raining so con-
tinuously that though the tent was
erected safely, the ground was so
nooued that we decided to pull it
uown, losje the night, and go on to
Kimberley. rn Dreaking uown the
tent, the ground was so soft that
tne pegs came out —the king-pole
crashed down, and broke into splint-
ers. This meant we could only open
m Kimberley with a one-pole tent in-
stead of two. However, it rained
ail the next day, and our Kimberley
season opened very badly, thougn
the next day we could not accommo-
aate the crowds. In Kimberley, some
of our company bought diamonds,
thinking they would get many bar-
gains, but it didn’t take them long
to discover that they had paid as
much, and often more, than they
would have in London, Iceland, or
Hong Kong.
Stranded Theatricals.
On this African tour we came upon
many dead-beat entertainers, and
stranded companies. Impecunious
Australian actors cailed on us fre-
quently. Many of them had come
over with a certain dramatic man-
ager a year or two before, and had
never been able to get away. We
came upon a troupe of entertain-
ers on the lines of The Dandies and
The Strollers, who had stranded in
the Cape Province. They were that
down that they were busking in the
streets of some of the country towns.
At one town we were at, we alloweu
them to busk outside our tents at
the intervals, to enable them to take
up a collection and get down to Cape-
town. A certain Australian enter-
tainer landed in a town we were
playing, after having had a disas-
trous tour with his show. He de-
cided to open after we had finished,
so we did our best for him, by boost-
ing him on our programmes, etc.,
and to the friends we had made in
the town, and furthermore allowed
him every night to address our audi-
ences on the merits of his own show,
which was to open immediately we
quitted the town. The result was
(so I heard afterwards) that he did
big business, and he got on his feet
again. A couple of years passed, or
maybe it was a little less. 1 met
him in a certain vaudeville theatre
in Sydney.
“Hullo, S ,” 1 said; “when did
you get back from Africa?”
The bounder leant on his stick, and
wrinkled his forehead thoughtfully.
“What’s your name?” he asked.
I told him.
“Hm! Now, where have I met you
before?” Puffing a large cigar.
This was too much for Maurice
Ralph, who had, been with me in
Africa, and had bought the bounaer
drinks without number there. ‘ln
Africa at O— —, when you were on
the rocks,” he said.
That Interesting’ Mayor.
I came across some funny mayors,
in some of these African towns, but
they were invariaoiy very fine fol-
lows.' The most interesting was the
mayor who met us at the railway
station, at 8 p.m., niceiy drunk, ana
received us as officially as the Doiu
Mayor of Sydney would (except he
didn’t wear a robe) and drove the
whole company to the hotel in his
o.vn and some friends’ motor cars.
Every lew minutes of tne day the
mayor kept popping in to see n
we would have one. W e stood him.
and his sociability, most of the
morning, and then I said I must go
uown the market square to see how
the tent staff was getting on. He
insisted upon coming with me, and
it wasn’t long before the Mayor or
V- was driving tent pegs with
a sledge-hammer, and was helping
the niggers haul up the tent. in
the afternoon he took the whole com-
pany to his house to meet a tew of
the leading townspeople. Here he
had much more whisky. That night
he proudly stuck to me at the tent
door, and watched the townspeople
coming* in. lie told me he thouglit
the theatrical business was a grand
business, and he would like to buy
an interest in it. He saluted every-
one who went in, and there was an
air of ownership and whisky about
him —mostly the latter. After the
show started, he watched me count
up the money. . o> ,
“How much have you got m.
asked the undignified mayor.
“Eighty five pounds, tour shil-
lings,” I answered.
He threw his cork helmet on the
ground and jumped on it disgus-
tedly. “That all,” he said, ‘ I would
have sworn it nearly £l5O. I’m very
disappointed —come and have a
drink J •
Our train left the station at about
3 a.m. next morning. The mayor
was there to see us off. I couldn t
swear to it, but in the darkness I
believe I saw big' whisky tears in
his eyes as the train pulled out.
Onward to Johannesburg.
For months we had heard nothing
but “wait till you get to Johannes-
burg ” It was Africa, we were toid
by travelling Johannesburgers!
There was nothing else in the coun-
try but Johannesburg! If gold gave
out at Johannesburg, it would be
good-night to Africa, so they said.
So, with the dream of Johannesburg
blinding us to most other things,
we hurried through Klerksdorp,
paused at Potchefstroom for a day,
and to our horror found we had sent
on a section of our big tent
to Johannesburg, so it was beyond
recall. The weather looked fine, so
we put up the side walls of the tent.
It was a blazingly hot afternoon, so
we were confident of a fine night, but
at dusk up came the thunder-clouds
and it drizzled dismally. To give a
performance was impossible, so we
returned all money that had been
taken, packed up, and made our last
stage for the City of Gold.
Johannesburg.
. Johannesburg is the great city of
Africa. Considering its age, it is
wonderful. Existing a thousand miles
in the interior of a country, out-
wardly with all the luxuries of a con-
tinental city, and at the same time
of such youth, one cannot help mar-
velling at it. Though a thousand
miles further from . London that
Capetown by communication and rail,
it is thousands of miles nearer
Europe in life, fashion, and comforts.
Its building's, shops, and hotels are
remarkably fine, and the class o
theatrical entertainment was better
when I was there than the town
should expect. However, things
have altered theatrically a great deal
in the last two years. .
There is no other town m South
Africa of 100,000 population, yet
there were theatrical managers who
were endeavoring to cater for it on
the London standard. The total
population of Johannesburg is about
240,000; of these, about half are
white, and the others are niggers,
Hindoos, etc. To make a compari-
son the white population is about
the size of that of Auckland, or
about four-fifths of the population of
Brisbane. Yet, at the time I speak
of, there were almost as many
theatres and picture shows as in
Melbourne or Sydney. There was not
a single management that was do-
ing any good, and yet others were
rushing in recklessly. The manage-
ments were B. and F. Wheeler (run-
ning Gaiety companies mostly),
Leonard Rayne (also in the
mate), The Empire Theatres, Ltd.,
Africa’s Amalgamated Theatres,
Ltd and The Palladium Theatres,
Ltd.’ (the last three being vaudeville
managements). As I said before the
country was full of broken or break-
ing theatrical companies at this
time. Business was everywhere
bad, yet a new company was formed
to run vaudeville in opposition to
the Empire Theatres, Ltd. This
company was called The Palladium
Theatres, Ltd. A fine new theatre
was built in Johannesburg, and the
opening bill, which included The
Banvards, Lucy Gillette, The K a >~
nos, and other high-salaried acts,
cost not a penny under £5OO per
week for artistes’ salaries alone, n
was a foregone conclusion that this
wild fight between vaudeville man-
ag*ers could not go on. The Pallad-
ium Theatres, Ltd., lasted only a few
weeks and collapsed; the Empire
went the same way. A very smart
little man named Slessenger engin-
eered the reconstruction of the whole
vaudeville business. He merged ali
the vaudeville shows under the one
control, and called it “African Thea-
tres Trust, Ltd,” and considering
wars, rebellions, and strikes in Africa,
the new organisation has made won-
derful progress, I believe. Its latest
move was to take over the J. C.
Williamson African interests. The
African firm of J. C. Williamson
came into the business at the time
I am writing about, taking over B.
and F. Wheeler’s interests. 111-luck
dogged the steps of the firm from
the start —-strikes, rebellions, ware.
Of the old managements, only one
remains, and that one is Leonard
Rayne, who has been a figurehead in
African theatrical life for many
years.
Australians in Africa.
Australian there are in thousands
in Johannesburg—in fact, they are
all over Africa. More than a few
did I find in newspaper offices. In
Johannesburg I engaged an old
friend, Bob Young, a New Zealander,
to go as our advance manager to
Canada. Bob has since returned to
Africa, and is now general manager
of The Empire Theatre.
Pretoria was one of the finest
towns we visited in Africa; and
being the old Dutch capital, had
many interests for us. Here our
mayor, Hayati Hassid, ran away from
us. We were obliged to sue him for
breach of agreement, and got a
verdict for £lOO damages, but it was
never collected. He had told us for
a long time that he was homesick
and pined to see his relatives in New
York. However, he didn’t go to them
for three years after. After Pre-
toria, we visited Heidelberg, Volk-
rust, Standerton and Ladysmith—at
the latter place we spent a Sunday
and saw famous Spion Kop and the
battlefields around it. Pietermaritz-
burg we found a very English town;
in fact, the whole of Natal is very
English. Then we saw Durban for
the second time, arid liked it as
much as we did the first. It has an
air of Oriental luxury, and it was
a joy to again live beside the ocean
after some months in the interior.
The African tour, lasting under
lour months, showed a profit of ap-
proximately £3,000. Next month I’ll
tell you how quickly and easily we
lost it.
In liondon.
There was no direct line of
steamers at that time from Africa
to North America, so we had to go
to London hrst, and then across the
Atlantic. We all had about ten
days' holiday in London, and the
midgets had a very busy time.
Some of their relations came from
Austria and Germany to see them,
for they had been away from then
homes for over two years. Many
of the midgets had been to America,
before —to New itork, and parts of
the United States, but none had
ever been to Canada. They had
showed with Shubert Bros, at lhe
New York Hippodrome. For the
American tour we renewed our
wardrobe, scenery and printing.
Canada had never had a show of the
Tiny Town kind, and prospects
looked great. Especially when one
studied the populations of the
Canadian towns, and compared the
number of good-sized towns there,
and the number in Australia, “if
we made so much in Australia,
what ought we to make in Canada,
with a bigger population!” one
naturally argued, it had been our
intention, after the tour of Africa
was completed, to go to India ana
The East, but 1 came to the con
elusion The East could wait, and
that w r e should go to Canada and
pick up all the spare money there,
ft w r as a bad day when 1 came to
that conclusion; 1 remember I ar-
rived at it at The Beach Hotel, East
London (South Africa).
Off to Canada.
Well, away we went to Canada.
“Bob” Young (now general man-
ager for the African Sheaton’s
l rust) had gone on ahead to ad-
vance the show. He met the boat
(the “Megantic”) at Montreal, and
a lonelv, unhappy man he was.
“Oh, I’m glad you’ve come,
he said. ‘T don’t like it here, or
at Quebec either, but they tell me
it’s better when you get out West.
I don’t seem to be able to make
them interested in the show, and


everyone seems to be trying to take
me down. Most of the theatres
are closed, and those that are not
are running stock. They tell me
people don’t expect to go to the
theatres in summer, and that we
ought to have come in winter time.”
I soon got the depression Boh
Young was suffering from; no one
seemed to care whether -we lived
or died. The town was as nicely
billed, and the press publicity was
as good as anyone could wish for
in Australia. Then came the first
blow !
Circus Opposition.
One morning we woke up, and
found Montreal practically covered
with Barnum and Bailey’s printing
—advertising their opening the
first week as we were. Our bill-
ing, of course, was absolutely in-
significant alongside theirs, and we
knew we were as dead as a door-
nail as far as our first week was '
concerned anyway. The afternoon
we opened, Barnum and Bailey’s
had their street parade. As is al-
ways the case, when the circus
comes to town in America, business
w'as suspended in the shops and
offices of the city, and the. streets
were crowded with scores of thous-
ands of sightseers. The circus
procession was three miles long,
and was bigger and more elaborate
than any Fight-hour procession
we’ve seen in Australia. We closed
up our show, and went to see the
procession ourselves. Whilst the
circus was in town we played prac-
tically to nothing.
MontreaL.
Montreal is the biggest city in
the Dominion of Canada, but I
cannot say it impressed us. It
strongly resembled a dirty Italian
town, or the dirty parts of Paris.
Its roads were badly paved, and
filthy in condition. Huge holes,
filled with evil-smelling mud, were
everywhere. However, we were in-
formed that contractors were at
work making roads. The tram com-
panies were also putting down new
lines, and the telephone authori-
ties were installing a new system
of underground wires. So you can
easily imagine the state of chaos
the streets were in. A great pro-
portion of the population is made
up of poor French. In MontreaJ
there seemed to be evidences every-
where of graft and corruption. The
advice given us upon landing was
to believe no one unless their un-
dertaking was put in writing. We
found this the best plan to adopt.
On our advance agent’s and man-
ager’s petty cash and other state-
ments, “Graft If) dollars —Graft 30
dollars, etc.,” are frequent items.
Canadians told me they loathed
Americans. But, strange to say,
they imitated them in their mode
of living, eating, drinking, think-
ing, and speaking.
Bad First Impression.
Our first impression of Canada
was not favorable. We had un-
ending trouble over the lease of
the premises we performed in. The
period of the year was July, and
most theatres were closed for the
summer, and many managers will
not open them under any consid-
eration. I herelore, we were obliged
io ht up a place tnat had been used
as an ice-skating rink. We spent
uiousands of dollars on seating,
etc., to make it comfortable, and
suddenly, just as the place was
looking nice and cosy, in popped
Mr. bailiff, and sat down in the
most comfortable chair. He had
been put in by the Municipality
for unpaid rates and taxes. Not our
rates and taxes, of course; it was
a debt of our landlords. We took it
as a joke, and treated the bailiff
most courteously, but —
Next day another came along
with a writ against the previous
tenant. We began to scratch our
heads. We paid the bailiff for
rates and taxes, and took it off
our landlord’s; rent. Then the
following day another bailiff came
along, so getting the name of a
good solicitor from a friend, I went
and put my troubles before him.
“Well, that’s strange, Mr. Smith,
you should come to me,” he said
as I finished my tale of woe. “I
have just instructed a bailiff to go
to the Airdome (that was the name
of the place we were showing at).
1 represent the original ground
landlord, and we have got an
unsatisfied judgment for 1500 dol-
lars for back rent against the
people you are renting from.”
It was necessary to make up one’s
mind very quickly, and I can assure
you mine was. 1 left the solicitor ar-
ranging to call back and see him
later. I made my plans on the
spur of the moment, and thev were
carried through with bewildering
rapidity. This was the position :
Writs and bailiffs were rolling in
with such daily regularity that one
couldn’t see where it was all go-
ing to end. Our landlords (The
Airdome was a limited company)
had nothing, and it looked pretty
sure that their creditors would
fight hard for the possession of the
property. I saw it ivas best to get
out whilst there was time. Of
course, had our property been
seized, we would have eventually
been able to secure its release, but
that would take time and money,
so—
Beating 1 the Bailiffs.
Jumping into my motor car out-
side the solicitor’s office, I chased
round Montreal picking up labor-
ers, and any handy men 1 could lay
my hands on. They were bundled
into the car, and whisked off to the
Airdome. In less than an hour
everything that could be shifted
was taken off the premises and
dumped in the street. Carriers
were secured, raihvay trucks order-
ed, and v’hen the bailiff arrived,
all that v’as left of our property to
seize was about 1200 dollars’ worth
of seating. He w r as particularly-
disappointed to find that my motor
car and the ponies were not on
the premises. That same evening
we went to Ottawa., leaving in-
structions with a solicitor to fight
for the recovery of our seating. We
haven’t recovered it yet, and I’d
sell our chances o, getting it very
cheaply.
Ottawa.
Ottawa, the capital city of the
Dominion, is splendidly built and
picturesquely situated on the Ot-
tawa River, with its rapids and ex-
tensive lumber mills. Tremendous
timber rafts are everywhere floating-
down the river. The people of this
towm are probably the best of all
Canadians. Their tastes, education
and manners all seem higher than in-
most other places of the Dominion
—though, of course, there are cul-
tured, highly educated people every-
where, but Ottawa has more of
them for its size than elsewhere.
This is due, undoubtedly, to the
presence of the seat of Govern-
ment, and the heads of department
that reside there.
For general theatrical attrac-
tions, Ottawa has not a very goon
name, but concerts, etc., are popu-
lar. We found our matinees were
extiemely well patronised by good
class people and their children.
Enormous Shows.
Canada, at this period of the
\ ear, was over-run with circuses
and big carnival shows. Amongst the
circuses were Barnum and bailey A,
and Rmgling’s, and Sells-Floto— the
three biggest in the woild. Alto
■.eether, we came across ten, some or
them carrying as many as 15UU
neople. They were huge travelling
canvas cities. It took four long
special trains to move some of them
from one city to another. The
seating capacity of their biggest
tent was 25,000. Besides travelling
performers, tent-men, grooms,
musicians and cooks, these circuses
carry walking-stick sellers, ice-
cream vendors, peanut kings, etc.
Everyone is fed by the manage-
ment, and the staff of cooks and
waiters is as big as the whole re-
tinue of most Australian circuses.
The dining tent is as big as the
main tent used by an Australian
circus.
Circus versus Circus.
it was a whole summer of fight-
ing for circus supremacy in Can-
ada, and one of the first to collapse
was the Buffalo Bill-Pawnee Bill
Wild West Show and Circus. They
went up against it to the extent oi
100,000 dollars. Many other cir-
cuses were in similar straits.
Amongst the creditors of a busted
circus was a well-known Chicago
firm of printers. Their debt was
50,000 dollars (,£10,000) for print-
ing supplied. This will give you
some idea of the amount of print-
ing used by a circus in a season
in America. In summer circuses
make for Canada, because of the
heat further south in the States. In
winter all the big shows go into
their winter quarters and reorgan-
ise for the next season.
Canvas Cities.
In this country we have little
idea of what a big circus really
ineans.
For instance, we are used to
Wirths’ Circus coming into Mel-
bourne or Sydney for anything up
to a three-months’ season. In Can-
ada and most places in the States,
no circus remains in the biggest
towns more than two days. Think
of it! Fancy Wirths’ coming into
Sydney for two days. In most
towns the stay is limited to one
day—two performances being-
given. The local authorities limit
the seasons in this way. You can
readily understand that the arrival
of a circus with 1500 people, hun-
dreds and hundreds of horses, and
goodness knows how many ele-
phants, lions, etc., make a big hole
in the foodstuffs of that town. If
the circus remained long there
might be a famine. Apart from
eating a town out of house and
home, there is the money side of
it to be considered too. With the
takings of its side-shows, refresh-
ments, etc., a big circus can take
anything up to £lO,OOO in a dav.
I his is a lot of monev to take out
of a town.
Circus Publicity.
Most aieatrical shows in Aus-
tralia oniy carry one advance man.
Even witn wirths’ Circus, just
George Teterson goes aheaa as a
rule, and relies on the local bill-
posting iirms to put out his print-
ing. but with a big American
circus there are on an average 100
advance agents, bill-posters, and
advertising experts. With Tiny
r own we nad three men ahead, and
we tnougm mat was mtting tnmgs
up. rust 1 went rignt aneaa uy

aous, alter examining them very

Bined While I Slept.
i remember coming across a
town mat hadn t a circus bill any-
where about it, so I reckoned we
would have a lair chance. 1 booked
tne local theatre, and that mgnt
went to sleep ano didn’t dream ot
circuses tor once. 1 was in the din-
ing room of tne hotel next morn-
ing about 8.45 for my breakfast,
and i noticed there seemed a great
deal of excitement amongst the
waitresses. i ordered ham and
eggs.
'•flam and eggs are off, sir,’’
said the girl.
•'Well, give me a grilled cutlet.”
“Cutlets are off, sir. In fact
pretty well everything is off. You
see the Barnum and Bailey’s No.
1 car came in this morning, and
all the advance men have been in to
breakfast.”
' Under my plate I found an ad-
vertising- novelty of Barnum and
Bailey’s. In the hall were their
iithographs. 1 went into the bar;
that was full of their advertising
printing. I went out the front
door, and right opposite was a forty
feet by ten teet sign.
BAENUM AND BAILEY’S.
Greatest Show on Earth.
The windows of the shops were
plastered with their pictorials. On
the side walls of buildings all the
way up the street were their ban-
ners. Their billposters, etc., had
been everywhere. They had ar-
rived at daybreak—some twenty-five
or thirty of them —by their special
railway car fitted up with boilers
to make their paste in, and their
printing all pigeon-holed. They
had billed the town while I was ly-
ing abed congratulating myself no
circus was coming to the town, and
not satisfied with eating up all the
advertising space in the town, they
had eaten up my breakfast. They
only remained a few hours, and
whisked on to the next town, but
they left no doubt in the public’s
mind as to whether it was true that
Barnum and Bailey’s Greatest Show
on Earth was coming to the town.
A few days later the No. 2 car
turns up. This, too, lets loose a
pack of billposters, etc., and any
available advertising space the
Number One car missed in the
town, they find and make use of.
Apart from these men, there are
others who travel by motor car by-
road, and they’ snipe advertising
matter along the country roads.
Farmer Cyrus Hank’s barn is beau-
tifully’ plastered by them, and Cy-
rus is very proud of it, and the
neighbors for miles around come
and study- it on Sunday afternoon
as though it were a panorama of
the Battle of Gettysburg.
Oh, dear! Oh, Lor’!
Well, this is what our modest
little show had to contend with.
We certainly learned things, but
it cost a lot of money in getting
the education. It was summer time
—gdorious Canadian summer time,
but they didn’t want theatre shows
then. Had it been winter, perhaps,
we could have had a very different
story’ to tell.
I bought a 15 h.p. Rover touring
car in England, and shipped it to
Canada with the Tiny Town Com-
pany. But in England I first had six
weeks’ joy with it, wandering
through the Counties, seeing |more
in a week-end tour than the average
Australian sees of the British Isles
in a six-months’ spell. Had I known
how bad the Canadian roads were, i
would never have taken the car over;
though I must say that, bad as the
roads were, the car proved very use-
ful to us.
In one week I travelled nearly 1500
miles by car through the provinces of
Quebec and Ontario, booking our tour.
In that week 1 visited thirty-six
towns and booked fourteen. At one
time, I had some wild ideas of motor-
ing right across Canada, but busi-
ness got so bad that I put the car
on the Canadian Pacific express, and
shipped it to Vancouver, then to
Sydney. Certainly, it was delight-
ful motoring through those rich
Canadian provinces in early summer,
with the corn-fields just ripening,
and the raspberries just ready to ,
pick, growing wild along the coun-
try roads in many places, the hedges
of maples acting as dividing fences,
cool blue lakes teeming with fish;
fields full of flowers, and all that
sort of thing. But, oh! how it was
all spoiled by the knowledge that we
were losing about £4OO a \yeek.
There were amazingly few English
motor cars in Canada. Practically
all had been manufactured in the
United States, though at a Canadian
town called Oshawa, I did see a
motor car factory, Ford cars were
everywhere; they swarmed along the
roads in the big cities like lice.
Bents.
The rents asked at towns that I i
decided were worth playing were ]
always extortionate. For little barn- i
like places, filled with vermin, people
asked anything from £6 to £25 per
night. Most of the places hadn’t had
a show in them for weeks; many of
them looked as though nothing had
been in them for years. One strange,
place we played at was over an
undertaker’s shop, and before we
could use it, he had to clear out
coffins that he had stored there. This
“theatre” was called THE GRAND
OPERA HOUSE —with emphasis on
the “Grand.”
There was another Opera House
we played in that was situated over
some stables. The proprietor came to
us just as Iwe were starting tnc
performance, and asked:
“Would you mind cutting out any
dancing, as the floor isn’t too strong,
and it might collapse.”
At one tiny Ontario town, with
hardly more than half a dozen
houses, the landlady of the hotel
(who had been rushing round doing
her utmost to make us comfortable)
was most apologetic when we were
leaving. , .
“I’m sorry I haven’t been able to
do more for you, but I’m short-
handed, you see. MY DAUGHTER
HAS GONE AWAY TO THE COUN-
TFtY 99 *'
It was about equal to a doctor
ordering a man away from Never-
tire to some quieter place, for a
rest cure.
Population Boosting - .
Canadians don’t know what it is
to be modest when talking about the
population of their towns. Though,
maybe, you are carrying the absolute
latest book giving the populations of
each town, not once in a hundred
times does a Canadian agree that the
figures are dnywhere near correct.
“The population of this town is
225,000, is it not?” you will ask.
And the Canadian invariably re-
plies :
•‘225,000! No, sir. The population
of our town is over 300,000.”
Certainly, populations of Canadian
towns have increased rapidly, but
this extraordinary growth is in the
West. I am perfectly satisfied that
these new Canadians who , flock in
year after year, are not theatre-
goers. Looking at it from my own
experience, and from the experience
of many others I have met who have
toured Canada, I must say Canada is
the worst theatrical country in the
English-speaking world. Talking
with Hale Hamilton the other day,
he said:
“I have played Canada several
times, and I don’t think I have ever
seen a decent house.”
Often when we had bad houses
(they were invariably bad), local
people used to say to us: “Oh, don’t
get disheartened—the people come
very late here.” We came to the con-
clusion that the people came so late
that they arrived after we had left
the town.
Honorary Stage Staffs.
In Canada, it is customary when
a theatre is rented, for the landlord
to supply stage hands, and men to
act as ticket-sellers, door-keepers,
ushers, etc.
At Napanee, when we arrived to
open the theatre, we wpre delighted
to And quite a good crowd of people
waiting at the doors. It was only
6.45 and it certainly looked very pro-
mising. We began to believe our luck
was changing. We unpacked our
tickets, and got ready to open up.
Then I called to the caretaker:
“Please send the front of house
staff in, Mr. Ryan.”
“Come on, front of house staff,” he
Of) 1 1 Pfl n-n d
THE WHOLE CROWD AT THE
DOOR STEPPED FORWARD IN A
.BODY. It appears the front of
house staff are not paid for their
services; it is reckoned a free look
at the show is sufficient payment.
Often the stages of the “Opera
Houses” we played at were over-run
with scene-shifters, who blocked the
entrances, and often, in their interest
in the show, craned their necks round
the wings, forgetful they were in
view of the audience. There’s a
great field there for Mr. Phillips, or
Mr. Huckerby (of the Stage Em-
ployees’ Union) to organise. Stage
hands and front of house staff were
the only two cheap items we found
in Canada.
Dressing Booms.
Dressing room accommodation was
very bad in many of these smaller
Canadian towns. This reminds me of
a good American story I recently
heard of a one-night ,stand tour.
The manager upon looking over the
theatre found there was only one
dressing room. He sent for the
theatre proprietor.
“Say, where’s the ladies’ dressing
rocm?"
“This is it, right here,” answered
the owner.
“Well, where’s the gent.’s dressing
room?” asked the manager.
“Right here,” was tne reply.
“But the ladies and gentlemen of
my company won’t dress in the same
room,” said the manager indignantly.
“Why’s that?” asked the other.
“Ain’t they speakin’?”
1 was in a shipping office one day
in Vancouver, when old gentle-
man and his wife entered.
“Whq.t can I do for j you, sir?”
asked the clerk. • '
“I want to know,” said the old
man, “the cheapest and quickest way
to get out of Canada, and back to
England.” ‘
' The End.
* .
■ That was just how tve felt about
it, too; and we all left by the first
boat for Australia. New Zealand
was re-visited first, and excellent
business was again done there- —until
the 1 big waterside Workers’ strike
forced‘ us to abandon-our tour. A
short country tour in Australia was
next done, and in January, 1914, the
midgets all left for their several
homes in Austria and Germany. It
had been our intention to tour the
East in 1915, but war broke out in
August, 1914, and- I’ve never heard
a word of the little people since.
Tiny Town was a unique show, and
I don’t suppose I will ever look upon
its like again. .

ABSOLUTE REFUSAL OF PR&OHERS TO WGR*
WITH MEN WHO WOULDN’T FIGHT.
A incident occurred op. W*d- ;
jucaday at a camp in the south of JfeigUusd I
where a largo number of German prisoner® [
are engaged in making roads. j
A number cf conscientious oWeotors wer®
detailed to assist the prisoners, but on their j
arrival the prisoners struck work. A Ger-
man non-commissioned officer who was I
delegated to speak to th© officer in com-
mand said: " These men are conseiention*
objectors and won't fight for their country,
and we work with them. Let them
go and fight—the cowards !**
The officer tried to reason with the dele-

accept any punishment, but they would
not work with conscientious t bjenters.
Eventually the objectors were withdrawn I
and the strike ended. i


How the World Crisis Was Turned
Monash and His Australians Achieve Fame
(By E. B. PEACOCK)
AFTER a continuous campaign of a
most strenuous character, ex-
tending throughout the spring,
summer, and autumn of 1918, the bulk
of the Australians were withdrawn
from the line for relaxation, the artil-
lery alone remaining in action to sup-
port the Americans, who are weak in
this aim of their organisation. Leave
was granted generously, and London
was crowded with the Australian boys
from the front. Numbers of the higher
officials also enjoyed well-earned rest
after their world-renowned accom-
plishments. Consequently, it is pos-
sible to get full particulars, and con-
nect together details accounting for
the astounding achievements of the
Australians at the crisis of great world
conflict.
FLESH FOR THE SACRIFICE
Picture more than 200 Divisions of the
enemy assembled on the Western frent
—a great Military Autocracy prepared
to sacrifice a million men to attain
their objective, the largest, most pow-
erful, and most highly organised mili-
tary machine the world has ever seen.
The force was in battle array, with all
the hellish devices and methods of sci-
ence and ingenuity at their disposal.
There were gas shells of various de-
scriptions. artillery barrages, and
every conceivable means of clearing
the ground before the great hammer-
head blow' was directed by division af-
ter division being hurled against the
retreating defence. The whole gigan-
tic machinery had five days’ impetus,
during which it had advanced miles
every day, and was then within a few
hours of the key position of Amiens,
which, had they reached, the crucial
objective would have been attained.
The French ard British Armies w'ould
have been separated, the latter threat-
ened with immediate destruction,
Calais reached, the channel dominated,
and Paris would have been again in the
grasp of the Hun. To look back on
it now is to feel the shudder of escap-
ing from some hideous nightmare. Two
generations of preparation, both men-
tal and physical, of the greatest mili-
tary power in the world had been
spent. All the resources of the study,
laboratory, workshop and field nad been
spent All the resources of the study,'
laboratory, workshop and field had!
been brought to the highest pitch and
accumulated on the selected battle
ground, moving resistless force to the
realisation of its vast conception and
elaborate plan for world domination. i
AUSTRALIA IN THE BREACH (
It seems unbelievable that our mere;
little handful of Australians could:
have met the onrushing hosts at such
a critical point and brought their pro-
gress to a dead stop, immediately turn-
ing retreating defence into persistent'
attack, attack, attack, without giving!
a moment’s respite, or yielding an inch '
of ground. On one day only did Her-
culean counter-attacks win back for a
few hbuis a single position. For the.
rest the Germans retreated continu-
ously ever since the Australians were
thrown into the breach, and the
atnazing records stand to the credit of
the five Australian Divisions that dur-
ing six months they met and defeated
73 German Divisions —equal to one-third
of tfie whole German and Austrian
armies on the western front. Six of
the German Divisions were so badly
cut up that they had to he dis-
banded. Twenty-eight thousand six
hundred and fifty prisoners, 332 guns,
including two railway guns (one 11.2'
in. and one 9 in.) and one lain, gun and
mounting, many thousands of machine
guns, mortars, search lights, vehicles
and kitchens, in addition to millions of
rounds of artillery ammunition were
captured, while a total of 116 towns and
villages, in addition to many fortified
farms, mills, sugar refineries, etc., and
more than 251 square miles of territory
were liberated from the power of the
invader. Those who do not know
the Australians appear to think that
they are half-wild men who got their
experience and training either as bush-, 1
rangers or hunting bushrangers. They'
cannot conceive that they are ordinary!
citizens of a free country—lawyers, en-
gineers. artisans, mechanics, bank
clerks, salesmen —all and sundry who
go to make the nucleus of a great na-
tion under wholesome, natural condi-
tions.
it took the Germans four years to
prepare their schemes, accumulate!
their vast stores of material, and bring |
together their enormous masses of
men, to develop their plans of attack,
and try to co-ordinate their efforts so
as to ensure that the utmost success
should be secured. All this was but
a stage in their long dream of ultimate
■world domination. Against this was
pitted at the crucial point the merest
handful of Australian volunteers
drawn from a population of less than 1
five million people, and it took them
about four months to dissolve the
dream.
MONASH’S GREAT FORCE
The writer is indebted to an inter-
view with our great Australian
General, Sir John Monash, for a peep
behind the scenes which gives some
explanation of the astounding achieve-
i»ents of the Australians during the
campaign. It is difficult even to
mention the incidents without the ap-
pearance of boasting. It cannot be
denied that the performances have
been decisive in the whole war. They
result from a decision of High Policy
arrived at early in the year which has
had startling and important effects. In
January the five Australian Divisions
were brought together as one corps,
and functioned as? suolp Previously
the Division nad been the Unit, and
as a result of this decision
both the Australians and Canadians
became fixed in administration and
lighting organisations. But the new
arrangement did not last long. Force
of circumstances led to their being
scattered again soon after formation.
They came together again during the
end of March and early April and by
the end of April developed into the Aus-
tralian Army Corps under General
Birdwood. About the middle of May
the supreme command of the Austra-
lian Army Corps was handed over to
General Monash. who was supported
throughout his whole newly created
fighting organisation entirely hv Aus-
tralian officers. The effect of this new
creation was an immense advantage in
fixity and unity of thought policy and
purpose. From time to time and for
special purposes British and Canadian
troops were requisitioned and combined
under General Monash so that his com-
mand at times exceeded 200,000
men. There was immediately a vast
improvement in fighting efficiency and
(file development of a policy of vigor-
ous offensive against the enemy. Dur-
ing April and May all other sections of
the front were on the defensive, while
the Australians were continuously on
the offensive, attacking all the time,
wearing down the man-power, re-
sources and moral of the enemy. In
this policy General Monash and his
Australian officers were in line with
General Allenby in Palestine and other
of the greatest Generals, who realist
that it takes quite as many men tc
fin'd a defensive line without the pos-
sibility of advantage as it does to at-|
tack with all the indirect influence as
well as actual possibilities.
NOVEL PLANS DEVISED
During this period of incessant at-
tack, the Australian Army Corps com-
mand was secretly studying and de-
veloping plans which when put into
operation constituted the surprise of
the whole campaign. They were
bringing to bear on the problem
the employment of the latest scientific?
conceptions and appliances. Quite new
j and novel methods were thought out.
| The plans were designed to protect and
conserve our limited man power to the
utmost, at the same time inflicting the
maximum of destruction on the enemy.
The latest types of tanks, working in
co-ordination and communication with
lov-flying air-force, entirely new infan-
try tactical methods for which a|
month’s special training had been
undergone, were among the ideas de-
veloped. Look in imagination into the!
sports chib room, where a picked lot of
Australian Captains of teams are work-
ing out every conceivable new stunt
and surprise tactic to play off against
an opposing international team in a
classic game. There you have the!
parallel.
The chief captaha is a great engineer.
The rules of the g*me are less rigid.
The players stake their lives. The issue,
is world freedom. Posterity the judge.
|At last the day came on July 4 to put
jthe carefully elaborated plans into
operation, as an experiment. The result
was an attack on Hamel. This was the
first occasion during tho year’s opera-
tion of a definite Allied offensive, and
was General Monash’s first Australian
Corps operation. The effect w r as magi-;
cal. Hamel became the model for all
subsequent operations. The High Com-
mand published the whole plan of!
battle In pamphlet form, which became
a new text book and had the effect of
turning the thoughts of the whole of
the Allied commanders from the defen-
sive to the offensive.
AMIENS MADE SAFE
This victory disengaged Amiens, and
discouraged any further thoughts of
the enemy in that direction. All these
activities, continuous attacking,
thought, planning, training, exper-
imenting, and example, led up to the
opening of the great offensive on August
8. From then onwards for ten weeks
, the Australian Army Corps was fight-
' ing every day, with the almost incon-
|ceivable results shown in the accom-i
ipanying tabulated and statistical state-j
ment. Daily battles were fought which j
will become classic. The two most con-i
spicuous successes were the forcing of
the line of the Somme, with the cap-
ture of Mont St. Quentin and the
breaching of the world-famous Hinden-
burg line at Bellicourt.
Both these achievements, while set-
! ting a pace for others, were effective
in forcing the enemy back towards his
own frontier, compelling withdrawals at
other points, and were unquestionably
quite decisive in the campaign.
MILITARY INSTINCT BORN
General Monash considers the Aus-
tralian nation has in a remarkable
manner developed the military instinct.
Officers and men rapidly acquiring the
fullest possible knowledge of the art of
war. He attributes their success to the
large number of gallant and able of-
ficers and particularly staff officers
who were able to co-ordinate and make
effective the instinctive characteristics,
self reliance, resourcefulness, intelli-
gence and energy of the whole force
rank and file. The long sustained ter-
rific effort was not possible without
efficient staff work. War is one-tenth
fighting and nine-tenths work, making
roads, railways, bridges, transporting
stores, supplies and the thousand of
constant cares that come within the
scope of general efficiency staff work
in a. great war. All the senior officers
of the Australian Army Corps were
Australians, whose work will bear
comparison with any in the world, It
was interesting, certainly compkmen-
ta.ry, and often amusing to see officers
from other sections coming round on
the quiet to “get tips.”
Then the General goes back still fur-
ther for causes. The ol
Australia has come into his own. The
pioneers of our great system of edu-
| cation builded better than they knew.
(The teacher working with his trouble-
Isome pupil in the public school could
not have imagined that he was build-
ing character which would determine
world destiny. State Education taught
'its scholars to think, and become in-
dependent, self-reliant and resourceful.
When all the officers of a unit were
out of action, the next man, a pri-
vate, took control and “carried on” —
la demonstration which crystallises the
soul of Democracy. Discipline was ex-
erted to the utmost limit, and intelli-
gence realised the advantage of the
highest efficiency in united effort.
Then came the spirit and the sporting
characteristic; a policy of vigorous of-
fensive.
Fighting all the time is cheapest in
man power. It wears down the enemy
land makes him yield. A footpad prowl-
ling about at night will not be likely
■to frequent the locality of the gym-
'nasium or athletic club, nor will he
attack a man whom he knows to be a
prize fighter. He will look out for a
softer material for his enterprises. So
it was not long before “Jerry got the
wind up about the Australians, and
would not face them.” Australians
truly have written a brilliant and
glorious page in the World’s history,
and have won for themselves the re-
spect, admiration and love of the lib-
erated peoples.
The performances of the Australian
Army Corps, during the spring, summer
'and autumn campaigns of 1918, cannot,
i be described with any pretence of doing
ithem adequate justice, except at con-
siderable length, and with the aid of
many maps and diagrams,
i It is possible, however, to enumerate
in tabular form certain statistics, which
are in themselves an index in part of
the character and extent of this series
of brilliant victories, whether con-
sidei-ed relatively to the performances
lof other British Corps, or absolutely
on their own merits.
These criteria may be classified thus:
| (a) Prisoners and guns captured.
(b) Towns and villages recaptured,
i ( C ) Frontages, depths and areas of
the successive advances.
(d) Enemy divisions engaged and de-
feated.
In order to aid perusal, several of
the above data have been subdivided
over nine arbitrarily chosen periods or;
phases extending from March 26, 1918 —
when Australian troops first arrived
opposite Amiens —until October 15, 1918,
when the Corps was withdrawn for
rest.
Each of the above criteria has, there-
fore, been tabulated in nine successive
stages, and the total is also given in
. each case for the period as a whole.

73 DEFEATS IXFJjICTED
It is usual to reckon that when a
division has been engaged more than
once, it is to be taken as two or three
divisions. On the above basis the to- j
tal number of divisions engaged and
defeated amounts to 73 during the
period under review, or more than
one-third of the total German Army
on the Western Front. Of these divi-
sions not less than six are definitely
known to have been disbanded as the
(result of the shattering losses suffered
during these engagements. There is,
however, very good reason to believe
that a number of others of the divi-
sions named have also been disbanded,
but it is customary to sift the evidence
very carefully and conservatively be-
fore drawing such a definite conclu-
sion.

Sixty-Four Australians Win Victoria Cross
Sister Dominion of Canada Outstripped in Contest
Sixty-four Australians have been
awarded the Victoria Cross in the pre-
sent war. Three of these are soldiers
who gained the distinction while serv-
ing elsewhere than in the Australian!
Imperial Force.
The three referred to, whose names
are included in the accompanying table,
ere the late Major Lance G. Hawker,
Royal Flying Corps; the late Lieuten-
ant Thomas William Dartnell, City of
London Regiment, and John Mayman.
who won the Cross while serving with
General Botha’s East African Force.
Australia’s total of Victoria Cross
winners in the war exceeds the record
established by Canada, 55 Canadians
having gained the coveted distinction.
The Canadian figures, however, cover
the period up to October 31, whereas
those for Australia extend to Decem-
ber.
Canada has a population of ap-
proximately 8.090,000 and Austra-
lia a population of approximate-
ly 5,000,000. Up to October Canada
had raised 552,601 men for war
service, all of whom, with the exception
of about 25,000, were obtained under the
voluntary system. The total enlistments
in Australia up to October 31 were
415,685.
Taking these figures as a basis of
calculation the enlistments in Australia
have been approximately two to every
24 of population, and the enlistments in
Canada two to every 29 of population.
The proportions of ' Victoria Crosses
won to the numbers enlisted in each.
country are:—Australia, one to every
6495; Canada, one to every 10,047.
The proportions of Victoria Crosses
gained to the populations of each coun-
try are:—Australia, one to every
78,125; Canada, one to every 145,454.
Australians have gained Victoria
Crosses in four theatres of operations
in the present war as follows:

famous lolephants of the Sho'W — b » m ™ ison «
(T N THE elephant’s heart there
qJ can surely be no other ambition
' than the humble one of proud
humility. Yet at least two of his
species have won fame, and neither
marble nor the gilded monuments of
princes will outlive their memorials
which consist simply of their own
bones.
One of these elephants was Chu-
nee, the other Jumbo. The skeleton
of the first has a place of honor in
the museum of the Royal College of
Surgeons, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, Lon-
don. That of the second is in the
natural history ’museum, of Tufts
College, America, which has the ele-
phant’s head for its emblem. But
tho similarly respected after death,
they were very dissimilarly treated
in life. Jumbo was the pet of the
world’s doting folly, Chunee the vic-
tim of its ignorant cruelty.
Nearly all elephants in the annals
of showmanship were docile crea-
tures and therefore unknown to
fame. Chunee and Jumbo were only
tame as a rule, and it is their sup-
posed tendency to must, more than
their exceptional size, which started
them on the road to celebrity. Per-
haps the name of Chunee may>sound
unfamiliar to modern ears even tho
Arnold! Bennett borrowed the de-
tails of his death to supply a vividly
realistic incident in “The Old Wives
Tale”. Anyhow Chunee created such
a stir in his own lifetime that to
declare you have never heard of him
would be a confession of ignorance.
“The Life, Death and Dissection of
the Largest Elephant Ever Known in
This Country”, published 1826, is the
most authoritative of his biographies.
The author, who describes himself
as “a person deprived of one arm’’,
was John Taylor, Chunee’s keeper.
He states that his charge was
brought to England in 1810.
About this time the managers of
Covent Garden Theater, desiring a
new sensation for “Harlequin and
Padmanaba”, their Christmas pan-
tomime, hired him and for 40 nights he
shared with Grimaldi the triumphs
of pantomime. Then he “evinced
symptoms of anger”, and was sent
to the menagerie at Exeter ’Change
in the Strand. Judging by the con-
dition of his tusks after death, the
poor beast had suffered for years
from toothache on a scale which
suggests the giraffe's proverbial
sore throat. Pain would probably
account for all poor Chunee’s mis-
behavior, blit in his life this was
supposed to be due to a thwarted
desire for a wild jaunt in the jungle.
He was always, even at his death,
fond of his keepers tho they were
not often so disposed towards him.
The first was Copps, later keeper
of the wild beasts at the Tower,
whose fault was simply that his at-
tentions were not as unceasing as
-an elephant expects. One day he
entered the cage while wearing a
new suit. Not being recognized, he
was pushed against a wall and a tusk
went each side of hist body. Cross,
the new proprietor of the menagerie,
rushed to the rescue with a pike,
and by thus engaging Chunee’s an-
ger—probably due to fright—en-
abled the injured keeper to crawl
away and resign his job to Dyer,
who seems to be the villain of the
piece.
In a school-girlish spirit, Chunee
decided to play a prank upon the
newcomer. Raising himself on his
hind legs and supporting himself
against the partition with his tusks,
he put his head over his cage, seized
Dyer’s clothes from the trainer’s
sleeping box with his trunk, tore
them to pieces and ate them. For
this he was brutally punished with
a spear. Unable to rest, in his nar-
row cage, Chunee thought of more
mischief. This time he again got on
his hind legs and pulling down the
ceiling, covered himself with plaster.
Once more he was punished terribly.
Taylor, who had been called in as
assistant keeper, now advised kind-
ness, which was tried for a time.
Then Dyer, ignoring the fate of
Copps, came on duty one morning in
a fancy costume he had worn at a
masquerade, and had his nose laid
open. Once again Chunee was pun-
ished, but Dyer retired and Taylor
became the occupant of the box be-
side the den.
Evidently Chunee could not resist
the temptation to play tricks on
newcomers. One night Taylor awoke
shivering to find his clothes and the
bed clothes gone; looking between
the bars, he saw all the missing
things on top of the elephant’s head.
Allowing full time for the. joke to
be thoroly enjoyed, Chunee permitted
her keeper to regain his blankets and
sleep.
“TUSKO”, the pride of the Al G. Barnes Circus.
CyT T LENGTH Taylor left. The
Cxi/ nex t keeper, a German named
Tietjen, was caught against
the wall when Chunee was turning
round, and killed. Chunee accepted
a carrot from the coroner’s jury, and
the verdict was “accidental death”.
Cartmell, the next, resembled his
charge in that both were too fright-
ened to be gentle. When Taylor,
paying for admittance, next entered
the menagerie, “the poor beast was
in a filthy condition, covered with
wounds received from spears, and
indeed scarcely a part of him but
what was covered with marks of ill-
treatment he had received.” The
next day, March 1, 1826, Chunee, be-
ing in his 23d year and having been
confined to Exeter ’Change for 17
j ears, began persistently to batter
the bars of oak, each about three
feet in girth, bound w T ith iron and
about a foot apart.
In an hour one had been started
from the crossbeam. If he should
step outside his specially supported
enclosure, he would crash thru the
floor to the shops, carrying with him
tigers and other wild beasts. The
alarm was given. TVhile Cross vain-
ly tried to tempt Chunee to eat ar-
senic, corrosive sublimate and
strychnine, disguised as dainties,
the Exchange beneath was cleared
and the gates locked. Still Chunee,
a red light (so they said) in his
eyes, battered and rammed. Cross
was in a panic. “Rifles! Rifles!”
he shouted and hundreds of voices
took up the cry. The sentry at
Somerset House was implored to
come, but refused. The) corporal,
however, presently marched his
guard to the attack. Friends ran
hither and thither, fetching pikes, a
saber and a poker. Others ran to
the gunsmith’s in Holborn. Cross
himself burst in upon Joshua Brooke,
lecturer on anatomy, and scandalized
his pupils by begging him to attend
an execution as expert adviser.
While the keepers stood under arms,
listening to instructions concerning
how best to retreat, cords were
passed around the bars which had
been weakened.
Here we may pause to question
the evidence. Everybody agreed aft-
erwards that Chunee was mad with
rage by this time. Nevertheless he
allowed the bars to be roped and
when his keeper called “Chunee,
Chunee, Chuneelah”, he came for-
ward in the hope of receiving fruit
from a friend. Instead he received
two bullets aimed at his heart. In
a fury which even a human being
should understand, he charged for-
wards and knocked down one of the
posts. The army of execution fled,
Outside, the crowd, thrilled with the
shots, the crash of timbers, the
shouts for rifles, the fearful yells of
the flying keepers, flocked from all
parts of the Strand to the gates
of the Exchange and were held back
with difficulty by Bow Street patrols,
People offered as much as two
guineas to see the spectacle of clum-
sy murder, but no one was admitted
until “the animal was so completely
exhausted as to preclude all reason-
able apprehension of danger”; and
this was not yet. After their first
fright, the armed gang inside ad-
vanced, uttering threats, with lev-
eled spears. Their leader fired two
more shots, which enraged Chunee as
before. As rifles were few, single
shots were repeatedly fired. Chunee
turned his back to protect his head,
but there was a small grated window
at the back of his den and thru this
the chief marksman took aim. Then
the poor beast raced round and
round, yelling and screaming, while
the two-legged brutes shouted tri-
umphantly. Amid cheers, the two
privates from Somerset House dis-
charged three or four rounds, which
was all the ammunition they had.
Then Mr. Brooke arrived with the
advice that the ear, the eye and the
gullet should be the targets.
C/V~T INTERVALS the keeper,
Q/l/ remaining in hiding to pre-
vent Chunee from knowing
that he also was an enemy, uttered
his cry of “Chunee, Chunee, Chunee-
lah”, and was obeyed. More than
once, when he called “Bite, Chunee,
bite”, the poor wretch knelt, and so
enabled the anatomist’s directions to
be followed. After the discharge of
about 30 balls, he sank and an exult-
ing voice exclaimed: “He’s down,
boys, he’s down.” He started to his
feet, only to receive 80 more balls
and fall again. For an hour and a,
half this discharge of musketry con-
tinued: 152 shots were fired. While
he lay with his head in a corner,
Cartmell thrust a sword into his body
up to the hilt. Again Chunee rose
and tried to keep his head out of
sight, which gave the gang a chance
to lash the gate of his den securely.
This done, shots were fired into his
ear.
Making a last effort more furious
than all the others, Chunee dislodged
the gates but did not break the ropes.
Then he gradually and deliberately
dropped into the “Bite, Chunee, bite”
attitude, and died, the chief marks-
man firing into the gullet and ear of
the corpse while eager spectators
waded thru blood to witness the end
of the famous victory.
This revolting demonstration of
the depravity of the mob had a fit-
ting sequel. Directly it was proved
that the elephant was really dead,
the public were admitted at the usual
prices, swarming past the cages of
terrified birds and beasts to inspect
his wounds and gashes. Thruout
Thursday, Friday and Saturday, in
they thronged. Butchers worked all
Saturday night at the flaying. The
skin, weighing a ton, was sold for
£lO to a gentleman who retailed it
in bits as souvenirs. So far had the
renown of this deed been bruited
that application for the skeleton was
made by an anatomical theater on
the Continent, but the Royal College
of Surgeons secured the trophy. Aft-
er that, apart from performances at
Sadler’s Wells during the summer
of “Chuneelah; or, the Death of the
Elephant at Exeter ’Change”, the
poor beast was allowed to rest in
pieces distributed thruout the land.
that time onward ele-
q/ phants became increasingly be-
loved. Menageries became more
healthy. Cross’s left the King’s Mews
for the Royal Surrey Zoological Gar-
dens, and the Royal Zoological So-
ciety’s in Regent’s Park rendered in-
door shows of wild beasts in London
unprofitable. There was, however, a
craze for performing elephants at
the theaters in the ’4os and ’sos.
They were often introduced into
equestrian dramas at Astley’s, whose
ideas were copied by the manager
(Mr. Honner) of the City of London
Theater, when he staged “The Ele-
phants of the Pagoda” in 1846. The
two elephants were from the Cirque
National of Paris; one had to select
the future sovereign, detect poison,
dance with “the Light of the Harem”,
walk over a sleeping slave and cross
a single plank until, joined with the
other, he helped to draw the Rajah’s
triumphal car.
Seven years later, in “The Wise


Elephants of the East; or, the Magic
Gong”, at Astley’s, two young ele-
phants first performed their new
conventional circus tricks, as the
critic of the “Illustrated London
News” described:
“These vast creatures are made to
stand on their hind legs, with their
fore feet, poodle wise, dangling in
the air; one of them also makes a
colossal bridge for the other to pass
under, and the latter ultimately is
seen standing, as it were, on its
head and trunk, with its hind legs
raised perpendicularly. Both ele-
phants also place themselves on
pedestals, and wheel round rapidly;
the female contrives, moreover, to
balance herself on two side legs on
a narrow pedestal, and the male,
placing his fore feet on the pedestal,
pirouets, in a circular direction, with
extraordinary swiftness, the atten-
dant being all the while on his back,
who still retains his position after
the animal quits the pedestal, and
during the time that he lies down
and rises again to his feet.”
Thus the understanding between
man and elephant grew, until the era
of Jumbo, In his youth he was
merely an African elephant caught
by Arabs and traded to a Bavarian
collector who sold him to the Jardin
des Plantes, Paris, who exchanged
him for a rhinoceros from the Zoo-
logical Gardens. Like Chunee, he
started growing in bulk and the un-
certainty of his temper. When he
had attained the height of 12
feet, length of 14 feet and weight
of 7 tons, Barnum grew covetous.
One day he called for Whimsical
Walker, a clown well versed in the
handling of animals, and sent him
to Paris with sealed orders. These
read:
“Go to the Grand Hotel, Paris.
There our representative, Davis, is
lying dangerously ill. Do the best
for him. Should he have gone before
you get there, get all his papers and
see him put. away regardless of ex-
pense. After doing your business
there go to the Zoological Gardens
and buy Jumbo. Don’t give more
than $5,000.”
Cyi S JUMBO was causing anxiety
at the Zoo, Barnum’s offer
was accepted. What happened
next is still a well-remembered 90
days’ wonder. The tale that he was
inclir.ed to “must” was questioned
by those who knew that children
were riding on his back at the time
the council of the Royal Zoological
Society was discussing the sale.
The Queen begged the Society not to
part with the elephant who had car-
ried the Prince of Wales on his back.
Ruskin protested in print against
the selling of a nation’s pet. The
public, not content with attending in
thousands to upset his temper for
the last times with gorges of buns,
bought souvenirs of a kind that con-
trasted strangely with the souvenirs
of Chunee still exhibited in London
shop windows.
“There were,” says M. R. Werner
in his “Life of Barnum”, “Jumbo
cigars, Jumbo letterheads, Jumbo
earrings, fans, hats and cravats,
Jumbo underclothing and Jumbo
overcoats, Jumbo boots and Jumbo
perfumes. On the menus of London
hotels were Jumbo soups and hash,
Jumbo fritters and stews, Jumbo sal-
ads and pies, Jumbo ice cream and
Jumbo kisses:.”
Delighted with the anguish of
Great Britian at losing Jumbo and
of America at the fear of not getting
Jumbo; Barnum prolonged the agony.
His partner, Bailey, cabled “Keep
Jumbo back until further orders”, to
Whimsical Walker, who arranged for
Jumbo to refuse to enter his travel-
ling box until the zenith of the
world’s excitement had been reached.
Day by day his lame increased until
his ship, the Assyrian Monarch,
berthed in New York harbor, where
before the scandalized gaze of the
pious Barnum the vanguard of
America’s admiring millions poured a
quart of whisky and a quart of ale
down the throat of “the Only Masto-
don on Earth Whose Like the World
Will Never See Again”.
That occurred on April 9, 1882.
After three years of indolence and a
regulated diet, free from the orgies
of buns that had formerly produced
signs of “must” as regularly as
Chunee’s tusk-ache, Jumbo died from
being too lazy to get out of the way
of an express train. But Barnum was
not daunted by this, and the “masto-
don” still remained part of his
“Greatest Show on Earth”. In the
gaudy program broadcast thruout
London during his season at Olympia
in 1889, a full page, illustrated with
exciting woodcuts, is devoted to this
subject. The opening paragraph de-
serves quotation:
“GRAND JUMBO
“Now Returns To You.
“A Double Prodigy, and Science's
Most Majestic Triumph.
“The tragic death of Jumbo the
Great, who was killed by a freight
train at St. Thomas, Canada, 1885,
in the heroic and successful effort to
save Matthew Scott, his beloved
companion and keeper, and his dear
little comrade, the dwarf Clown Ele-
phant, ‘Tom Thumb’, was regarded
as almost a public calamity, and
evpked world-wide sorrow.” “That:
“THE BIGGEST AND BEST-
LOVED BEAST KNOWN TO MAN
“Is Not a Memory
“BUT STILL A STUPENDOUS
REALITY
Is due to the patient efforts and rare
scientific skill of the distinguished
Naturalist and Scientist, Prof. Henry
A. Ward, of Rochester, N. Y., who,
after months of arduous labor, tri-
umphantly succeeded in perpetuating
Jumbo in unimpaired grandeur of
presence and absolute perfection of
form, so that we not only exhibit
the Colossal Lord of All the Beasts
“AS NATURAL AND IMPOSING
AS IN LIFE
But in strange and most Wonder-
ful Addition, and standing at his
side,
“JUMBO’S PERFECT AND TRE-
MENDOUS SKELETON”
HERE is another sequel to this
biography. In London Jumbo
had a wife named Alice. After
his death she was bought by Barnum
& Bailey who, advertising her as
“Jumbo’s Widow”, stood her next to
his stuffed hide and skeleton. After
Tufts College had been endowed with
these exhibits we hear no more of
the widow. But there are one or
two tales in print about a certain
elephant named Alice, belonging to
the herd of the Ringlings, and pos-
sibly taken over from the Barnum &
Bailey show. She liked to be led to
rubbish heaps in order to trample
empty cans, but one day she trod on
one while her trunk was still explor-
ing its inside. In 1918 Alice was sold
to the Salt Lake Zoo. Two weeks
later the circus received a telegram,
“Please send something from circus.
Alice is lonesome.” A female Chow,
named Meat, a hanger-on of the kind
elephants dislike, was all that could
be spared. But a year later, when
the circus was passing thru Salt
Lake City, the keeper saw Alice sit-
ting up to amuse Sunday visitors to
Liberty Park, with Meat balanced on
her head. The two were called “in-
separables”.
Actually Jumbo was not the largest
elephant even of his time. Samson,
an Indian elephant in America,
weighed more. His owner, Cole,
billed him as biggest of his kind in
the world, but when this showman
bought an interest in “The Greatest
Show on Earth” little further was
heard af this claim. In “The Ways of
the Circus”, George Conklin, his
trainer, describes his fits of bad
temper and stampedes that fright-
ened the circus men, and how this
brought about his doom:
“Sam lost his life in the fire that
burned the Barnum & Bailey winter
quarters in Bridgeport. I was away
at the time of the fire and there was
no one else .who could unchain and
get him out of the building, so all
they could do was let him burn. Aft-
er the fire his bones were recovered
and mounted and are now on exhibi-
tion in the Museum of Natural His-
tory in New York City.”
OT'NOTHER victim of that fire
Cyi/ was Toung Taloung, the sa-
cred white elephant, that
Davis, Barnum’s man, brought from
Siam. Since his “whiteness” con-
sisted merely of some pink blotches
near the head, he had not been a
great success. Sanger refused to buy
a genuine specimen of this species
and showed the public “a handsome
creature white as driven snow”,
keeping up the pretense until, in
answer to the question of the Prince
of Wales (Edward VII) he confessed,
“We give him a coat of special
whitewash twice a day.” Adam
Forepaugh, Barnum’s rival, tfied the
same trick and survived a call from
the Prince of Siam by slapping his
royal visitor on the back and thus
persuading him to leave hurriedly.
Nowadays, however, the public is
too well-informed on the subject of
elephants for such tricks to be
played, or for any particular speci-
men to engage the whole of the pub-
lic’s affection. Yet we may still draw
this distinction between the elephant
and all the other animalsi of show-
manship; namely, that while riders
are more celebrated than their
horses, tamers better known than
their lions and trainers more ap-
plauded than their dogs, it is the
elephant himself, and not his keeper,
who wins the public interest.
Courtney Ryley Cooper’s account,
in “Lions 'n’ Tigers ’n’ Everything”,
of Old Mom proves that personality
in an elephant is not merely a legend.
This is the day, as far as the big
American circus is concerned, not
of the single elephant but of the
herd. Now each has a female for
leader and females for her assistants.
Old Mom, once leader at Hagen-
beck’s and then of the Ringling
Brothers’ herd of 25, deserves fame
far more than either Chunee or Jum-
bo. For some time after her arrival
from Germany at the head of a new
'‘bunch of bulls”, she meekly fell
into line behind Bumps, the Ringling
leader. One day she struck a young-
ster who had been squealing at re-
hearsals. Immediately afterwards
there was some excitement in the
picket line. The next day Mom
marched first, followed by her friend,
Frieda, and Bumps was third.
From that time forward she ruled
the herd in all matters and brought
them back to the circus after a stam-
pede. Yet she could be as kittenish
as Chunee in her hours of ease.
✓7)OTH “The Ways of the Circus”
and “Lions ’n* Tigers ’n’ Every-
thing” testify that the quick-
ness to take fright which first gave
Chunee a bad name is characteristic
of elephants, a mouse or a squeaking
pig being enough to upset an entire
herd. It is also plain that they are
liable to outbursts of bad temper.
Nevertheless they are tractable and
seem to like to perform. To teach
an elephant to lie down, says Mr.
Conklin, is difficult: stakes' and
tackle have to be used to pull him
over by force until he understands.
To teach him to stand on his head,
all the apparatus needed was a rope
tied to his back legs., a pulley and
another elephant to walk away until
his hindquarters rose in the air.
Other accomplishments are mili-
tary drill and clowning—to sit at
table, ring a bell, fan himself, drink
molasses and water out of a bottle
taken from a waiter, ring the bell
again, throw the table cloth over his
head and sit down on his trainer’s
* hat. One elephant was taught to
walk on a row of big wooden bottles.
Another to walk along a plank laid
on the floor, then on a raised plank
with pieces of rope bound to the
timber, “so that at a little distance
it looked like a huge rope.”
Thus the circus was able to bill an
elephant who would walk the tight
rope. “So far as I know I was the
first man to teach it to an elephant,”
says our author. Alas to spoil his
pardonable pride, but it is almost
the oldest of elephant’s tricks. If
the modern showman were to dip in-
to Suetonius he would read that
when Servius Sulpitius Galba was
Praetor during the plays and games
called “Floralia”, ■he showed a new
and strange kind of sight, to wit,
elephants walking upon ropes.
The White Elephant
ryr SO-CALLED white elephant is merly an albinistic Indian
elephant, in which more or less of the usual dark pigment
l7 i s absent from the skin, giving it a pale color. Such ele-
phants are rare, and are venerated in Siam and Burma. The phrase
“white elephant” is used figuratively to mean a dignity or possession
that is costly to maintain; anything burdensome to support. Most
dictionaries say that the phrase is an allusion vo the sacred white ele-
phants formerly presented by the king of Siam to those members or
his court whom he wished to destroy. Since the elephant was re-
garded as sacred, the courtier would have to have it cared for ac-
cordingly; yet to do so would reduce him to poverty. That is what
the dictionaries say.
The Pathfinder addressed a letter on this subject to the secretary
of the Siamese legation at Washington. M. Pra Sundara, secretary
of the legation, replied as follows: “I have your letter seeking an
explanation of the phrase ‘white elephant’ used in English in the
sense of a burdensome and expensive dignity, originating in the
supposed practice of the king of Siam of bestowing a white elephant
upon a nobleman whom he desired to ruin financially by the cost of
its upkeep. It is obvious that the idea embodied in the English phrase
is a result of the perversion of several simple facts.
“In the first place, a ‘white’ or albino elephant, being very rare,
and, consequently, highly prized, has never been given to a noble-
man, the king alone being deemed worthy to own such a creature,
indeed, the reverse is the case, for anyone in the country finding a
white elephant, whether noble or commoner, is in duty bound to
present it to the sovereign. Again, the notion of a white elephant
being an expensive burden is doubtless derived from the fact that
such an elephant is never put to work, but is maintained in a
special stable, with its own keepers, at considerable cost, and brings
in no return beyond being regarded as a symbol of the royal dignity
and an ornament to the State.”


Circus ißancl eMusic —■
CT'Af'OiW that the bluebirds are
C /Y ready to greet the coming cir-
cus seagon in welcoming song,
it will also mark the occasion for
the circus band to strike up for
the first grand entree end that in-
cidental music so necessary to the
presentation of the big-show pro-
gram.
The variety and number of out-
door .entertainments and sports that
seem to depend upon music to add
the proper spirit and, zest are grow-
ing from year to year. No football
game, athletic meet, horse race,
hockey match, and, to a lesser ex-
tent, baseball game, boxing, or
wrestling bout is complete from a
spectator's standpoint without band
music. A bull fight in Spain or
Mexico would not get the right
start without the grand entree of
die contestant contingent to stir-
ring music. Even at the cock fights
in the Philippines I have frequently
found the town hand present ready
46 fclay at every interlude between
* matches.
✓DOING hack to early times we
the amphitheater games of
the Romans opening to the fan-
fares of numerous brass instru-
ments, and these were also inci-
dentally used during the various
contests and hippodrome races,
'.following the fall of Roman civili-
zation 'the progress of the Romans
in brass music was lost for many
fVears; even the art of bending
metal tubes in making the instru-
ments was not recovered until sev-
eral centuries later. However, dur-
' ing the 13th century we begirt to
bear of strolling guilds oi musicians
in which various brass instruments
began to appear. These crude hands
were often present at the knightly
tournaments and jousts of the
period, and as these contests were
interspersed with feats of tum-
bling, rope walking and juggling,
we there got what was probably
the first circus music.
On the continent and in Great
Britain the gradual evolution from
the bands of strolling performers to
organized companies found the cir-
cus musicians present taking part in
the program, tho we must not
neglect to mention that we read in
fcfie ola accounts and records that
the music rendered very poor
in quality. Some of these small cir-
cus companies gradually drifted to
America from about the middle of
-*tbe lsth cefitury, and from the
’meager information obtainable, we
find, picked up musicians locally to
* help out with the performance.
Later in the old Quick & Mead
Circus, which toured this country
in 1826, we read of the music being
fdrnished on the hurdy-gurdy by a
Dutchman named Sanders, whjje
the performers took turns at beat-
ing the bass drum. We have also
heard it that the music of the early
John Robinson Show consisted of
Uncle John Robinson (or someone
else) sitting with his back to the
one center pole fiddling away for
dear life. It is of record that on
the old Aaron Turner Circus in
1 835 the band put up the tent while
the performers made the ring; fair
enough. All indicates that the cir-
cus music of these times was like
everything else of the period, crude
and undeveloped.
HE quality of circus music be-
gan to improve in America
following the ‘Civil War, prob-
ably because many bandsmen had
been developed in the various regi-
mental bands, had formed a taste
for roving, and found service with
a circus band much to their liking.
The overtures and grand entree
were played on brass, but the in-
cidental music altogether on string.
Some of the old bands and their
leaders of this time were the New
York Brass Band, mounted on
caparisoned steeds, with the Mel-
ville Circus in 1864; Prof. Post’s
Silver Cornet Band, on the Yankee
Robinson Show of 18 07; E. M.
Parmelee’s Silver Cornet Band, with
Am berg’s Circus, 1871; A. E. Men-
ter's Band, with Dan Rice in ’72
Fritz Hartman’s, with P. T. Barnum
in ’73; Prof. Tony Frank and 14 men
tuned up the old Adam Forepaugh
Show of ’7 5. Nearly all were billed
as “Silver Cornet Bands"; that is, if
at least the leader had a plated
instrument. They ran from 10 to 15
men with a part doubling on string.
On towards the ’Bos the yellow
boxwood clarinets appeared, and
later gave way to better reed instru-
ments, and the bands began to
handle the entire program without
the aid of string. Old rotary valve
instruments gave way to those with
piston valves, tenor horns to trom-
bones, E-flat cornets to B-flat,
bell-front altos to uprights, in-
strumentation from 10 to 15
up to from 2 0 to 30. In fact, the
’Bos was the decade which really
started the American Concert Mili-
tary Band and the circus had its
full share in its development. The
progressive circus proprietors,
Clowes and Cushing, brought over a
high-class musician, James S. Rob-
inson, from Drury Lane Theater
and Alhambra Place, London, in
1875 to take over their circus band
and make a feature of it; he did,
and in a few years began a long
engagement which extended thru
the ’Bos as leader of P. T. Barnum’s
big show band of 25 pieces.
W. N. Merrick, solo cornetist on
the Sells Bros.’ Show of 18 82, was
shortly after appointed leader and,
greatly increasing it in size, soon
made it a splendid organization.
'Mr. Merrick probably holds the
record for continuous years as a
circus bandmaster. He had the
Sells Bros., Forepaugh-Sells and
Hagenbeek-Wallace bands for long
periods and was active until a few
years ago. Joseph Withers was a
real band leader, as was George
Lee, who had Forepaugh's band
dui’ing these years.
decade of the ’9os brought
} further improvement and
progress in attaining a distinct
class in circus music. No leader had
greater part in bringing out this
result than George Ganweiler, who
took over the Adam Forepaugh Cir-
cus hand. He had plenty of com-
petition from such men as Carl
Claire, with Barnum & Bailey;
‘Charlie Gebest, on the John Robin-
son Show; Wm. F. Weldon, of
Ringling Bros.; W. N. Merrick, of
Sells Bros.; Wm. F. Goetz and C. Z.
Bronson, on the Ben Wallace Show;
Mont Long, with W. L. Main; Ed
B. Lemen, of Lemen Bros., and
others.
The outstanding characteristic of
Ganweiler was his tremendous zeal
and efficiency. A master musician
himself, tie was a terror to incom-
petents and shirkers’ for the first
left in a hurry and latter stayed
only as long as they held up. No
matter what ability a musician had
he had to cut everything as clean
and watch his cues right up to
“Home, Sweet Home’’, as he did
the first week out in order to stay
on with Ganwfeiler. Yet men knew
if they had a season under Gan-
weiler that was the only recom-
mendation needed, and to good
competent men he was most con-
siderate and paid top money.
The Ringlings brought Ganweiler
over to their show in 1897 and the
combination of A 1 Ringling and
George Ganweiler made the last
word in fine circus program pres-
entation.
Ringling Brothers were
\C) always to the front in de-
veloping the music of the
circus to high standards. Being
practical musicians themselves, they 1
knew what they wanted and got it.
Without question Wm. F. Weldon,
who had their band in the early
’9os, was a real band leader with a
fine band. Working with A 1 Ring-
ling he had to bo for this master
equestrian director could, by expert
arrangement coupled with snappy
band work, make any bunch of acts
look great. However, in 1895 Ring-
lings added A. Liberati, the famous
cornet soloist and conductor, and
about 2 5 high-class men to Wel-
don’s band just for the two one-
hour promenade concerts at 1 and
7 p.m. Liberati conducted these
concerts of the combined bands of
'5O pieces, which included 22 reeds,
3 E-flat basses and 3 88-flat
basses, as well as the full comple-
ment of other instruments. With
solos by Liberati and other artists,
and the highest class of program,
this master band created a furore
up East in new territory and justi-
fied the heavy expense for the time
being. It may tie mentioned that
the entire circus performance was
played by Mr. Weldon’s regular mr'
cus band, as Liberati and bis men
retired after the hour concerts. The
very next year Queen Lilolukalini’s
Royal Hawaiian Band, under the
direction of J. S. Libornie, was en-
gaged as an added feature for the
•Coliseum engagement at Chicago,
where the Ringling Show opened.
Carl Claire had wonderful success
with the Farnum & Bailey band.
He followed after Tames Robinson
and came over from the King &
Franklin Show. Mr. Claire was a
thoro musician and knew the circus
program requirements. During the
five-year European tour his band
was highly praised everywhere, and
in Europe they know good music.
During his many years as band-
master Mr. Claire used from 24 to
33 men. Following with the Bar-
num & Bailey band were Fred A.
Jewell and E. H. (Ned) Brill, fine
musicians and great conductors.
On the Ringling Show Ganweiler
was succeeded by such men as A 1
Sweet and ,T. J. Richards, of which
nothing said here can in any way
add to their fame as splendid band-
masters.
Of the combined Ringling and
Bornum & Bailey Shows just one
man has had this band since the
consolidation in 1919. Merle Evans
combines all the qualities that go to
make a fine circus bandmaster, mu-
sicianship, tact, personality, indus-
try and originality. Nothing more
need be said. His band ranges from
8 5 to 40 men each season.
/ATHER capable circus leaders of
y_y the last two decades or so are
’Mont Long, T. B. Long, Park
Prentiss, W. P. English, Carl Neel,
Karl L. King, M. C. Rogers, C. L.
Brown, Don Montgomery, A 1 J.

Gilson, Henry Kern, F. P. Meister,
Everett James, J. Griffin, Ben

Jos. Palmer and doubtless several
others.
Bandmasters of Wild West shows
will always have a good man to fol-
low in Bill Sweeney, a barber, of
•Sheridan, Wy., that Buffalo Bill
picked up who he was organizing
his combination ye s ago. Sweeney
had been leader of ihe local band
and was a lucky find for th n’ace,
as he made good from the start
and originated the form of ga'lops,
charges, etc., that put this sty.v of
show over. Peter Sacheto, with the
old Pawnee Bill band, and D. G.
■Laßanca and W. H. Fowler, of Mil-
ler Bros.* 101 Ranch, are other
leaders in this field recalled by
name.
Q/LL of the band talent has not
CJr i/ been confined to the larger
shows. Many good musicians,
as w r ell as high-class circus talent,
prefer the small ones. H. A. Van-
dercook had the J. H. LaPearl Cir-
cus band and was a high-class mu-
sician, composer and conductor.
Old Dad Lewis, on the Norris &
R< we Dog and Pony Show, always
had a snappy, capable band. A
short while ago, on January 27,
•Eugene Wack passed away at his
home in Chicago. The notice simply
said: “He was a well-known musi-
cian.’' He was more than that, he
was a great musician, performer
and conductor, whose field of en-
deavor w T as the small show. He had
the Bob Hunting Circus band, but
is was his 12-piece organization on
the Sipe, Dolman & Blake Dog and
Pony Show that made his reputa-
tion. With this band he accom-
plished overtures that would have
taxed an average band of 25. To
see Wack himself cutting clarinet
cadenzas from “Orpheus” on his
cornet and conducting at the same
time was worth the price of admis-
sion there. His incidental music to
the various acts was most beautiful,
original and oleasing. Eugene
Wack never had a superior for get-
ting results from a small band.
There were many capable men in
the small show field, but lack of
space forbids their mention.
fT WOULD like to discuss Sidn-
ey show bands and music, but sui'
fice it to say, P. G. Lowery, a
colored man, who has, I understand,
returned to the leadership of this
band with the Ringling Pros., lias
brought this music to the highest
and most artistic plane it -has ever
reached. Prof. Low r ery laid off sev-
eral seasons and was greatly missed
by people everywhere who recog-
nized his worth.
I have written this article be-
cause I enjoy circus music and be-
cause since O. A. Peterson, splendid
musician and conductor, has ceased
conducting his column, “Musical
Musings”, in The Billboard I have
read little about it and hope some-
one will undertake to keep the
circus musician before us.
I read a lot of how glad the band
trouper is he doesn’t have to make
parades any more; but we had some
mighty clever band men who- would
have never had to troupe but did
troupe for $l2 a week and liked the
view mighty fine from up there on
the Golden Chariot of Orpheus
drawn by 40 horses —*0, count ’em.
WHY TIGERS ARE STRIPED
At an examination a boy, tolled to state
why a tiger is striped, wrote: “It is striped
because it makes it better for circus propri-
etors. If a tiger escapes from r .arcus, it is
easier to find him than if he had no stripes.
He will not go far without some one notic-
ing that he is not a horse or a dog on ac-
count of his stripes, and calling up and
asking the circus people if they have lost a
tiger.”—The Front Rank.
