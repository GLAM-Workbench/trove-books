PREFACE.
The outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain and the
South African Republics has rendered it desirable that some
record of the events which have led up to the war should be
placed before the public. In The Boers and the British an
endeavor has been made to do this. The volume does not pretend
to be a work of great historical research, but the information in
it is accurate, and every effort has been made that it should be
impartial. The sources from which it has been culled are too
numerous to specify, and range from standard works down to the
latest files of the South African and other press. The admirable
accompanying map has been placed at the disposal of the
publisher by the proprietor of the Melbourne Leader , and will be
found of great service in following the course of events.

INTRODUCTION.
Very few political acts have been more fiercely debated
than the peace made by Mr. Gladstone when ho handed back
their independence to the Boers of the Transvaal ; and even
in the light of nearly twenty years’ experience it is impossible to
say whether that measure was a wise and statesmanlike one, the
outcome of a profound conviction of what was right, or whether it
was a mere party expedient, arising out of a disinclination to face
a great responsibility. On the one hand, it must not be forgotten
that the great mining city, with all its varied interests, was not in
existence, and that, so far as the British Cabinet knew, all they
were dealing with was the future of the Boer farmers. Mr. Glad-
stone, when in opposition, had certainly denounced the annexa-
tion of the Transvaal as unjust and impolitic, but as soon as he
got into power he just as certainly refused to undo the work of
that annexation. There may have been an excuse for yielding to
an armed revolt what had been refused to a peaceful request, but
such a preceding is always dangerous, putting a premium, as it
does, on all such rebellions in the future.
There is another aspect of the case, too. The whole course
of national evolution for the past century has been in the direction
of national amalgamations. Beginning with the United States,
which, in face of the revolution of 1776, was forced into a federa-
tion, the world has seen the great kingdom of Italy and the great
empire of Germany created out of innumerable independent and
semi-independent States. Austria and Hungary have only found
salvation in unity, and Canada, and last, but not least, Australia
have followed suit. So strong is this tendency, and the evils of a con-
trary policy so great, that almost any sacrifice is considered worth
while to attain and retain union. Germany fought throe wars


before if, could be safely accomplished, and fir forty years the
German people have submitted to a crushing military burden in
order to get and keep it. The United States were threatened with
disruption, but the wise and far-seeing statesmen of the north saw
that to establish two nations side by side, each speaking the same
tongue, and each probably armed to the teeth, would be to lay the
s ij eds of future misery untold. The great civil war was fought to
prevent it; a civil war which shook the country to its very founda-
tions, but which has been amply justified since.
In South Africa alone has a contrary policy been adopted.
While the greater portion of the territory south of the Zambesi is
under the British flag, two miniature Republics have been allowed
to establish themselves in the heart of the continent, effectually
blocking, at all events for the present, a South African federation,
Nevertheless this is the dream of all who take an interest in that
great country. Every South African statesman sees it in the dis-
tance, and is more or less striving and groping after it. Cecil
Rhodes is fighting for it, and has probably done more for it than
any other man. Even Kruger and Hofmeyer, Steyn and
Schreiner, and all the men of the Bond are in favor of it; the only
difference of opinion being as to whether the federation shall be a
British one, under the Union Jack, or as to whether it shall be a
Dutch one, under the flag of the United States of South Africa.
The causes of the war between the Boer Republics and Great
Britain are detailed at length elsewhere, and it is unnecessary to
refer to them here, except in one aspect. Under present condi-
tions it is recognised that the force of public opinion throughout
the world counts for a great deal in every conflict; and much of
the work of diplomacy is to secure this. The long negotiations
and the protracted delay before decisive action was taken by the
British government is accounted for by this fact. Every effort
was made to accommodate the differences, but unless a great and
powerful empire was prepared to see a large body of its subjects
permanently treated very little better than slaves, war was


inevitable unless the Transvaal government gave way and granted
the reforms asked for. There is a class of Englishmen, admirably
typified by Mr. Stead and Mr. Labouchere, which always
assumes that Great Britain is always and under every circum-
stance in the wrong, and that the enemies of Great Britain are
always and under every circumstance in the right. On such
people argument is wasted, but no fair minded person who knows
the whole of the circumstances can doubt that Great Britain
was bound to go to the rescue of the Uitlanders. These circum-
stances are fully set out in this volume, and it is for the purpose
of laying them before the people of Australia that it has been
published.




THE BOERS & THE BRITISH.
Dutch Rule
In 1486 two little vessels, tinder the command of an officer
named Bartholomew Dias, sailed from Portugal in search of an
open road to India. Pushing his way down the western coast,
Dias passed the farthest point previously known, and, sailing
onward, with the land always in sight, came to an inlet of no
great depth, with a group of islets at its entrance. There he cast
anchor, and for the first time Christian men trod the soil of Africa
south of the tropic. The inlet has ever since born the name
Angra Pequena, or Little Bay, which its discoverer gave to it.
Here he set up a cross as a mark of possession for his king.
Proceeding farther on his voyage Dias soon reached an islet
where he found fresh water, this being the one in Algoa Bay
which is still called Santa Cruz, in memory of the cross he set up.
Here the sailors objected to go any farther, and after two more
days’ sailing Dias turned back. On his way he discovered a bold
headland, which he named the Cape of Storms, this being after-
wards changed to the Cape of Good Hope.
Ten years passed away after the return of Dias before an
expedition was fitted out to follow up the discovery which he had


made. Four small vessels were then made ready, and were
placed under command of Vasco de Gama, and in 1497 these
doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and, on the 25th December in
that year gave the name of Natal, in honor of the day, to a part
of the eastern coast of the continent. From thence he continued
his voyage, and finally reached the goal for which he had been
steering, India.
The highway to the east being now opened, every year fleets
sailed to and from Portugal, and in a short time the Indian seas
fell entirely under Portuguese dominion, and an immense trade was
opened up. In 1503, a landing was made at Table Bay, but it was
many years before any systematic effort was made to use this spot
for the purpose of a resting place for the ships rounding the Gape.
The island of St. Helena had been discovered in 1502, and it was
here the vessels called for fresh water, wood, vegetables and meat.
After a long interval, English, Dutch, and French ships
followed the Portuguese to India, the English flag being seen on the
further side of the Cape of Good Hope for the first time in 1591.
In 1601 the first fleet was fitted out by the English East India
Company, and about the same time a number of small associations
were formed in Holland, then at its commercial zenith, for the
prosecution of the profitable Indian trade. The fleets sent out by
these gained surprising successes over the Portuguese in India, who
were regarded as fair prize of war, but as they did not act in con-
cert no permanent conquests was made. For this reason it was
resolved to unite and form one powerful company, and the Dutch
East India Company accordingly received a charter from the
states general. The profits made by it, especially at first, were
enormous, and every year fleets of richly laden ships passed the
Cape of Good Hope, outward and homeward bound. Even then
it was not thought necessary to form a station on the main land of
Africa, and it was not until 1651 that steps were taken to effect
this. In that year three vessels set sail from the Texel, under the
command of Jan van Riebeek, and in 1652 a landing was made


and some wooden sheds erected for the accommodation of the firs'
settlers. The infant colony met with all the troubles usual to sue!
enterprises, but in the course of ten or fifteen years it was wel’
established, and many of the company’s servants were grantee
pieces of land to cultivate, their wives and families being sent oul
to them.
For a long time, however, there was no permanent settlemenl
of people on the land, such as had taken place in America, and such
as afterwards took place in Australia. The place was looked upon
simply as a convenient station where ships on the way to and from
India might stop to rest and refit. A castle was built and a garrison
placed in it; and the fresh meat required for the scurvy-haunted crews
from India was obtained by barter from the Hottentots. This
was at last found to be too cumbrous a mode of obtaining supplies,
and about 1650 a steady effort was made to open up a large extent
of country by the introduction of European immigrants ; but even
by the end of the century the white population did not exceed 2000,
while Capetown did not contain more than eighty houses. But if
slow, the immigration was steady, while the natural increase of
population was considerable. A number of slaves had been intro-
duced, and slavery was looked upon as a regular institution ; regu-
lations being drawn up for its management. For seventy or eighty
years the colony continued to progress, settlement extending farther
and farther inland. Two things only formed any bar to its
complete prosperity; the first being the constant troubles with the
natives, and the second the occasional outbreaks of small-pox
which swept over the land.
In 1781 Great Britain declared war against the Netherlands,
and that country entered into an alliance with France. The
Dutch Fast India Company at this time was declining in pros-
perity, and was unable to maintain a large garrison at the Cape.
Practically, therefore, Capetown was almost defenceless, and
Great Britain had cast a covetous eye upon it as a half-way
station to the great empire she was building up in Hindostan.


As soon as war was proclaimed an English fleet with a
strong body of troops was despatched under Commodore George
Johnstone to seize the colony. The enterprise became known to
the French, and a squadron was hastily fitted out to thwart it.
The two met, and a sharp action followed, after which the French
pressed on and landed a force of men at the Cape. The English
■'followed, but made no attempt on the colony, contenting
themselves with capturing a number of richly laden Indiamen.
This had a disastrous effect on the Dutch Company. For many
years the English had been gaining ground in India, and, as they
appropriated one source of profit after another, the Batavian
association found its revenues decrease with startling rapidity.
It was soon in a state of hopeless insolvency, and this reacted on
the Cape Colony. Discontent arose, and the land was for a time
in a state of anarchy.
But while matters were in this state in South Africa a series
of astonishing events were taking place in Europe. The French
revolution had burst on a wondering world, and the mightiest
convulsion of modern times was shaking civilization to its very
centre. France became a republic. The people of the Netherlands
were divided into two parties, one of which favoured the new
ideas, and the other an alliance with England. The infant
republic exerted all its force, and its arms were triumphant
everywhere. The English forces were compelled to retire from
Holland, the French army entered it and received an enthusiastic
welcome from the republican party, which, now in power, entered
into an offensive and defensive alliance with France.
The British Government immediately fitted out an expedition
to seize the Cape Colony, and in June, 1795, it arrived in Simon’s
Bay, Admiral Elphinstone and Major-General Craig being in
command of the sea and land forces respectively. The officials
of the Dutch East India Company were almost all in sympathy
with the defeated Batavian, or Orange party, but the burghers
were generally in favor of the French, or patriot, faction. The


former were, therefore, inclined to extend a certain amount of
welcome to the British forces, but the latter prepared to offer
resistance. From five to six hundred trained men were available,
while it was calculated that at least 2000 burghers would have
responded to any call. The officials, however, entered into
correspondence with the British commanders, but eighteen days
passed andjno arrangement had been arrived at. Eight hundred
English soldiers were then landed and quartered in some deserted
buildings. In the meantime a Dutch camp had been formed at a
place called Minzenburg, on the road to Capetown, and on the
7th August, 1795, General Craig, at the head of sixteen hundred
men, marched to attack it. But no attempt was made to defend
the position, and a large quantity of artillery and stores fell into
the hands of the British. On the 4th of September a second fleet
of English ships arrived in Simon’s Bay, this having with it three
thousand men, under the command of General Clarke. On the
14th, therefore, two columns were formed, together between four
and five thousand men, and set out on the march to Capetown,
about sixteen miles distant. But a slight resistance was made,
most of the burghers dispersed to their homes, and after some
negotiation articles of capitulation were agreed to. These pro-
vided for the surrender of the Dutch troops, the officers being at
liberty to either remain at the Cape or return to Europe. The
colonists were to be at liberty to exercise the existing form of
religion, and were to retain all their existing rights. Everything
belonging to the Dutch East India Company was to be handed
over to the British officers, but all other property was to be
respected. At three o’clock in the afternoon of the 16th Septem-
ber, 1795, fourteen hundred British soldiers, under General Craig,
arrived at the castle in Capetown, and drew up on the open ground
in front. The Dutch troops marched out with colors flying and
drums beating, passed by the British, and laid down their arms as
prisoners of war. In the evening General Clarke arrived with
"two thousand infantry and a train of artillery.


Thus ended the government of the Cape by the Dutch East
India Company, after a rule of nearly 150 years, and thus com-
menced the first British occupation. This was not to last more
than eight years, and during that time quite a number of men
acted as governors of the new dependency. The relations between
these and the Dutch were, on the whole, as good as could be
expected. One or two attempts were made by France and
Holland to recapture the country, but these were always defeated,
one fleet of nine ships, with nearly 2000 soldiers, being taken in
Saldanha Bay without even a fight. Napoleon Buonaparte,
however, was anxious for at least a temporary peace ; and in 1802
the treaty of Amiens was signed between Great Britain, France
and the Batavian Republic. Under the terms of this the Cape
Colony was to be given up, and in February, 1808, a Dutch
garrison of rather over three thousand men replaced the British
troops.
The peace in Europe, however, was of but short duration.
Napoleon was quarreling with every nation that he could not force
to do his bidding, and in May, 1803, less than three months after
the handing over of Cape Colony to the Dutch, war again broke
out. The newly formed Batavian Republic was involved, and one
of the first thoughts of the British Government was for a second
expedition to the Cape. This was fully anticipated there, but the
Republic found itself unable to spare more men for its defence,
and, in fact, recalled the best regiment there for home service.
Nothing was done by Great Britain, however, and a state of
suspense continued, until the last week of 1805, when tidings were
received that a great fleet were approaching. This arrived in the
evening of 4th January, 1806, and consisted of sixty-three ships.
It came to anchor at the entrance to Table Bay, and there were on
Board nearly seven thousand soldiers, under the command of
Major General David Baird, an officer who had already served at
the Cape in 1798. In a day or two six regiments were landed
eighteen miles from Capetown. As soon as it was known that the


English were landing on the beach, a mixed force of men composed
of burghers, Dutch soldiers, German mercenaries, and a number
of Hottentots, marched to meet them. On the Bth the two armies
met, but the German mercenaries turned tail, and a charge being
made by three Highland regiments, the Cape army was forced to
retreat. The loss on the British side was fifteen killed and eighty
nine wounded, while 337 of the Cape army did not answer to their
names when the rolls were called, most of these however were men
who had deserted. General Baird resumed his march to Capetown,
and on the afternoon of the tenth, articles of capitulation were
signed. By these the Dutch troops were granted most honorable
conditions. It was provided that they should not be considered
prisoners of war, but be sent to Holland at the expense of the
British Government. Seven transports were prepared, and the
troops, numbering ninety four officers, and five hundred and seventy
three rank and file, were embarked in them. All being ready, on
the 6th of March, 1806, the squadron, bearing the last represen-
tatives of the dominion of Holland over the Cape Colony, set sail
for Europe. At this time the white population numbered some
25,000, while the colored slaves were about 30,000. There were
in addition, about 20,000 free coloured servants, so that, apart from
the Hottentots, there was a population of about 75,000. Capetown
contained 6,000 white, and 11,000 coloured persons.


British Rule.
It was only natural that the colonists should feel dejected
when the British flag was again the symbol of authority in South
Africa. They had been ardently attached to the Batavian
Republic, and had enjoyed three years of good government,
combined with ample liberty ; and almost in a moment this was
gone, and they were at the tender mercies of a conqueror. There
was one hope left, and that rested upon the chance of war. If
Napoleon should succeed in the struggle with England, which
seemed very probable in 1806, they would once more be connected
with their fatherland. And so in a spirit of despondency, but not
of absolute despair, they submitted to the power which they could
not resist.
For some time there was fear of actual famine in Capetown.
The inhabitants were restricted to a small daily allowance of
bread, but with all speed rice and wheat were imported from India,
and as the crops of the following season were remarkably good,
the danger passed away. As soon as possible the colony was
again placed under the same form of government as during the
first British occupation, and under the same commercial regu-
lations.
The earl of Caledon, an Irish nobleman, only twenty-nine
years of age, was sent out as governor with very great authority,
though in matters of primary importance he was to act under
instructions from the Secretary of State in London. He could
fix prices for any produce required by the army, and assess the
quantity each farmer was compelled to deliver. He directed and
controlled the different departments, and his proclamations and
notices had the force of law. He had also power to mitigate or
suspend the sentences passed by the inferior courts of law.


Although strict, he was an upright man, and was guided in all
his doings by a desire to improve the country. His benevolence
was unbounded, and, indeed, his last act when leaving the country
was to present a thousand pounds in currency to the orphan
asylum.
The most important measure of his administration had
reference to the Hottentots. These people had always in theory
been regarded as independent of the European Government, and
subject to chiefs of their own race. Only in cases where white
people or slaves were concerned were they liable to be tried before
'Courts of justice, and they were neither taxed nor called upon to
perform public services, except when of their own accord they
unlisted. In reality they lived in a state of anarchy.
As far as land was concerned, there were reserves set apart
for their benefit in the long-settled parts of the country, and they
could use ground not actually occupied by the farmers. But
many of them preferred to live as dependants of the white men,
though they seldom remained long in the service of the same
person. To obtain brandy and tobacco they were willing to
perform light labour occasionally, but nothing could induce them
to adopt a life of regular industry.
The earl of Caledon, then, issued a proclamation which
removed all vestiges of chieftainship from the Hottentots in the
colony, made them subject to European law, and restrained them
from wandering over the country at will. Any one found without
a pass was to be treated as a vagabond. These measures had a
really beneficial effect on the natives, for the vast majority of them
were rescued by these apparently harsh proceedings from utter
ruin, if not from extinction.
In 1811 Sir John Craddock succeeded the earl of Caledon as
Governor. He, too, was a man of very high principle, so that
autocratic rule at this period was presented to the colonists in its
l)est form. It was thought desirable to establish a circuit court.
Three members of the high court of justice were therefore


appointed, and they left Capetown to try important cases, to learn
whether the landrosts performed their duties correctly and
impartially, to inspect the district accounts and buildings, and to
report upon the condition of the people and all matters affecting
public interests. These proceedings were conducted with open
doors, and no distinction was made between persons of different
races or color, either as accuser, accused, or witnesses. Throughout
South Africa satisfaction was expressed with the establishment
of this court, and everywhere the judges were received with the
greatest respect. Unfortunately an outcry had been raised in
England about the alleged ill-treatment of the natives by the
farmers, and instructions were sent out that an investigation
should be made by the second circuit court. In this, the black
circuit, as it was afterwards called, no fewer than fifty-eight white
men and women were put on their trial for crimes supposed to
have been committed against natives or slaves, and over a
thousand witnesses were summoned to give evidence. The whole
country was in a state of commotion. The serious charges were
nearly all proved to be without foundation, but several individuals
were found guilty of assault and punished.
In the meantime there was standing trouble with the native
clans outside the borders of the colony. Farmers were harassed,
and in some cases murdered. A strong force was therefore got
together in 1812, and the tribe of the Kosas, about twenty
thousand in number, were driven beyond the borders. A line of
military posts, garrisoned partly by European soldiers, partly by
Hottentots, and partly by burghers, was formed from the sea to
the second chain of mountains, and the expelled people were thus
prevented from returning. The principal post in the line, where
the head-quarters of the troops were stationed, was named
Grahamstown, in honor of the officer in command.
In 1813 the French met with great reverses in Europe, and
one of the first results was that the Prince of Orange, who had
been in exile in England since 1795, returned to the Netherlands


and was received by the people as their ruler. To this time the
British Government regarded the Cape Colony, not as a national
possession, but as a conquest that might be restored to its original
owner on the conclusion of peace. But now an arrangement was
made with the Prince of the Netherlands that for a sum of six
million pounds sterling he should cede to Great Britain the Cape
Colony and some Dutch provinces in South America. This
agreement was embodied in a convention signed at London in
August, 1814, when the claim of the Netherlands to South Africa
was extinguished for ever.
By this means the hopes that the colonists entertained of
coming again under the flag of Holland were dissipated., but time
had done much to soften their regret. To say that they were
reconciled to British rule would be incorrect. They were, how-
ever, becoming accustomed to it, and, as yet, nothing had occurred
to cause any friction. Their language was still used in the courts
of law and the public offices. Their churches ha i been increased,
and their clergymen were paid by the State. Six new magistracies
had been established, and the financial position of the Government
was good. In the Cape Peninsula, where alone Englishmen
were met in considerable numbers, intermarriages were so common
that race antipathies were rapidly dying out After the absorption
of Holland by France, also, the colonists lost the enthusiastic
attachment which they had felt for the Batavian Republic, so
that altogether the prospect was fair that in course of time the
Europeans in South Africa would forget their old aversion to
British rule, and that English and Dutch would live in peace and
amity together.
Though the colony had now become a permanent British
possession, no change in the form of its government was made,
nor was there any reduction in the high salaries paid to the
principal officials. Lord Charles Somerset, who succeeded Sir
John Cradock, drew a salary of £IO,OOO a year, and was provided,
at the public expense, with a residence in town, a country house,.


a marine villa, and a shooting lodge in the bush. He and the
heads of departments absorbed more than a fourth of the entire
revenue of the country. Buildings required for government pur-
poses in the country and at Capetown were erected, but they were
paid for by the creation of paper money, and not from the Trea-
sury. Such a system could only end in disaster, and discontent
to British rule began to smoulder.
A farmer was summoned before a court of justice on a charge
of ill-treatment of a native servant, but he refused to attend. A
number of Hottentot soldiers were sent to arrest him, and, as he
defended himself, he was shot dead. The result was that a
number of his friends and relatives took up arms, but a strong
force of burghers, who had no sympathy with such lawlessness,
assisted the troops sent to restore order, and the revolt was sup-
pressed without much difficulty. There were thirty-nine prisoners
taken, and these were tried by a special commission ; six being
sentenced to death, and the others to various other punishments.
Of the six sentenced to death, five were actually hanged in the
presence of their companions. This was felt to be needless
severity, and the burghers who had helped to capture them were
greatly shocked at this severe punishment. By them, as well as
by the families of those Avho took part in the disturbance, the
event was long remembered with very bitter feelings towards the
British Government.


The British Immigration.
We have now arrived at an important period in the history
of South Africa. To this time the colonists outside of Capetown
were almost entirely Dutch speaking, but soon after the year 1820
the English language began to be heard among the farm houses,
as well as in the villages and towns throughout the country.
For several years after the peace which followed the downfall of
Napoleon, much distress was felt by the labouring classes of Great
Britain, and emigration was spoken of as the only effectual
remedy. In the Cape Colony in 1819, according to the census,
there were only 42,000 white people ; so it seemed to the imperial
government that the country invited settlers, and parliament with-
out demur granted £50,000 to defray the cost of sending out a
large party. Heads of families representing nearly ninety thousand
persons, applied for passages, and from these a selection was
of the number required. The ships in which they left England
and Ireland, with one exception, reached South Africa safely, and
in April 1820, the immigrants commenced to land on the sandy
beach of Algoa Bay. A few hundred who arrived a little later,
were located first at Clanwilliam, but in a short time most of them
abandoned that part of the colony and followed the others to
the eastern frontier. Several were people of some means who
brought out a number of servants and apprentices, the others
were of various callings, men who had worked in the factories in
England, clerks and storemen. There were nearly twice as many
male as female adults.
The imperial government defrayed the cost of ocean transit,
and each head of family was promised a plot of ground one hundred
acres in extent, on condition of occupying it for three years. Those
who brought out servants were to have an additional hundred acres


Tor each. Nothing more than this was promised, hut means of
transport to the land on which they were located were provided by
the government, and for more than eighteen months rations of food
were provided for those who required them. With few exceptions
the immigrants were located between the Bushman’s and Fish rivers,
a pleasant land to look upon, with waving grass and many stream-
lets and patches of dark evergreen forest in the recesses of the
mountains. At the same time that these people were being sent
from Great Britain at the expense of the state, a few came to
South Africa without any aid, on the assurance of the secretary of
state that they would receive large grants of land if they paid for
their passages. Altogether nearly five thousand individuals of
British birth settled in the colony in 1820 and 1821.
For several years the immigrants were subject to much
distress. Most of them knew nothing about tilling the ground,
but they tried to live upon their little farms until they could get
title deeds, in order to be able to sell. Season after season their
wheat crops were destroyed by rust. Then there was a great
flood, which washed away many cottages and gardens. In
addition to their other troubles roving natives made their way
into the district and robbed the poor people of many of the cattle
which they had purchased. At the end of 1821 the artisans
began to disperse, and in the different villages throughout the
colony they obtained plenty of work at prices that soon placed
them in a good position. They were followed from their locations
by many others who were not qualified to make good farmers, but
who easily found openings in other pursuits. The government
then enlarged the farms of those who knew how to make use of
them, and better times for all set in.
It was about five years after their arrival before each one
found himself in the sphere for which he was best adapted, and in
.another five years it began to be questioned whether any similar
party had ever done so well in any other country. Grahamstown
and Port Elizabeth owe their importance to these British


immigrants. In 1820 neither of the«e places was more than a
hamlet attached to a military post, but a few years later they were
flourishing towns. About one-eighth of the European inhabitants
of South Africa were now English speaking, and theirs was a
language which spreads quickly. When a man from the British
Islands and one from any other country live together, their
intercourse is conducted in the language of the Briton, for he
refuses to learn a speech that was strange to him in his youth.
In South Africa this matter might have been left to settle
itself, but the deepest feelings of the older colonists were stirred
by an order of the imperial government that after 1824 ail official
documents, and that after 1827 all proceedings in courts of law,
should be in English. In Simonstown, Grahamstown, and Port
Elizabeth the exclusive use of the English language was not
objected to, but in other places where Dutch was spoken by
nearly the whole of the people the order was regarded as a very
serious grievance. Many requests were made to the government
to annul it, but to no purpose, and on the dates named English
became the official language of the country. It would have been
difficult to devise a measure more calculated to irritate the Dutch
inhabitants. Just at this time, also, great distress was caused to
many people by an order concerning the paper money
There were in circulation notes to the nominal value of over
£700,000, of which about one-third had been created by the
British authorities, one-seventh had been forged so cleverly that
they could not be separated from those that were genuine, and
the remainder were of Dutch origin. The existence of this paper
was certainly a very great drawback to commerce, and it was
necessary for the advancement of the country that it should be
got rid of. But when an order came from England reducing it to
three-eights of its nominal value, and making British silver money
a legal tender at that rate of exchange, it was felt as a crushing
blow by many people. Not a few were entirely ruined. But
commerce was placed on a safe footing, and the old notes were


replaced by others, on which the reduced value was marked in
pounds sterling, and the Imperial Treasury was responsible for
their redemption in gold.
Notwithstanding these drawbacks the colony continued to
show signs of progress, and a number of new towns were founded.
The first lighthouse on the coast was built, and a good waggon
road was opened into the interior of the country. The breed of
cattle, and especially of horses, was greatly improved, mainly
through the importation of thoroughbred stock. Wine was the
principal article of export, but mules were sent to Mauritius and
horses to India in considerable numbers. In each district a high-
class Government school was established, to which parents were
invited to send their children free of charge. In the eastern
portions of the colony these schools were of the utmost service,
but in the western parts, where Dutch was mainly spoken, they
were regarded with considerable antipathy, the English language
being the only medium of instruction. In 1825 a council was
established to advise the Governor in such affairs of importance as
he might submit to it for discussion.
There gradually grew up, however, a system of government
which could only be regarded as vicious. The salaries of the
officials were enormous, and many abuses crept in. Sir
Benjamin D’Urban was, therefore, sent out as Governor, with
instructions to carry out several important measures. The first
was retrenchment of expenditure on a very extensive scale, as the
colonial revenue was less than the outlay, and the public debt was
increasing. Various offices were combined, so that one man had
to do the work formerly performed by two, and all salaries were
greatly reduced. The outlay on roads and buildings, and, in fact,
on everything maintained by the Government, was cut down as
much as possible. At the same time a species of Legislative
Council was created, and although it had no real power, it was
thought to be useful in several directions. The governor was sent
out, however, mainly for the emancipation of the slaves.


As long as the Dutch East India Company had held the Capa
slaves had been brought into it, but not in very large numbers,
for their services were only needed to a limited extent.
During the first British occupation a great many more were
imported, for the trade was profitable, and English energy was
employed in it. But by the time of the second conquest, opinions
in Great Britain on the subject had undergone a great change, and
the suppression of the foreign slave trade by the British Govern-
ment followed so closely on the capturing of the colony, that there
was only time for five hundred negroes to be imported. From
that date the increase in the number of the slaves was only due to
the natural increase of births over deaths. There never was
any attempt to defend the system in South Africa, and the
slaves were, as a rule, treated remarkably well. In fact the testi-
mony of every one competent to form an opinion, was that in no
other part of the world was bondage so light. Except in planting
and harvesting the labor of the negroes was easy, and they certainly
did not feel themselves degraded by compulsory service. In all,
money to the value of three millions of pounds sterling was invested
in slaves in Cape Colony.
In 1816 laws began to be made for reducing the power of
the masters, and conferring rights upon the slaves, and almost
every year they were added to. Public meetings were then held
at which the opinion was expressed that if the ties between the two
were slackened any more, it would be impossible to obtain any labor
from the slaves at all. A resolution was passed at one meeting,
and was generally agreed to in other districts, that if the English
government would stop further legislation on the subject, the slave
holders would consent that from that date all female children
should be free at birth, in order that slavery might gradually die
out. An attempt was also made by a few persons in Capetown to
purchase the freedom of some of the girl slaves, but not more than
twenty five were released in this way yearly, a number which had
no practical effect.


In 1830 an order in council was passed in England prescrib-
ing the food, clothing, and hours of labour of all slaves, and finally
destroying the remainder of the slave owner’s authority. This
precipitated a crisis and the excitement became so great that the
governor thought it necessary to prohibit public meetings. After-
wards, however, he gave his consent to a meeting being held, and
over two thousand owners came together in Capetown. The
utmost order prevailed, but resolutions were carried that the lately
issued orders wei'e unjust. The whole assembly then marched to
the open space in front of Government House, when two gentle-
men were deputed to inform the Governor that the slave holders
were prepared to suffer the penalties of the Orders-in-Council, but
could not obey them. In 1833, an emancipation Act, to have force
in all British possessions, was passed by the Imperial parliament.
For the Cape Colony it provided that, on the Ist December, 1834,
slavery was to cease, and, after a short term of apprenticeship, the
negroes were to have exactly the same rights as the white people.
The sum of twenty millions sterling was voted to compensate the
slave owners in the nineteen colonies affected, and the share of
each colony was to be determined by the appraised value of its
slaves.
There was a general impression that this money would suffice
to meet the whole, or nearly the whole, value of the slaves, and as
most of the colonists believed that a vagrant act would be passed
before the day of emancipation, they were disposed to accept the
new condition of things without much heartburning. There were
then in the colony a little under thirty-nine thousand slaves, of
whom between three and four thousand were old and infirm, and
the others were valued at rather over three millions of pounds
sterling. The year of 1885 was well advanced when intelligence
was received from England that the returns from all the colonies
were complete, and that the share of the twenty millions sterling
allotted to Cape Colony was a little less than a million and a
quarter sterling. This news created a panic greater than any


-ever before known in South Africa. Many of the late slaves were
mortgaged to the money-lending institutions, and every bond
contained a clause covering all other descriptions of property
owned by the borrower. There was an immediate demand for the
redemption of the bonds, and goods and effects were sold up all
over the land at any price that could be obtained. In some
instances the slaves had been the sole property of widows and
orphans or aged people, and the late owners were at once plunged
into indigence. But this was not the worst. News was next
received that the imperial government would not send the money
to South Africa, there to be distributed, but that each claim
would have to be sent to London, there to be proved before
certain commissioners, and that such amount of money ai was
allowed would be paid in stock, after certain charges were
deducted. This decision brought into the country a swarm of
petty agents, who bought up the claims for about half their real
value; so that a claimant, instead of receiving two-fifths of the
value of his slaves, was lucky if he got one-fifth, and in some
cases even less was paid. The result was a blow to the
community of terrific force.
It must be remembered that the whole white population of
the country was but small, and that it was not by any means a
flourishing place. The constant native wars and the bad system
of government tended to retard its progress, and to at once
destroy property to the value of two millions sterling was thought
to be the culminating point of mismanagement. Many families
were entirely ruined, while even the strongest suffered severe loss.
About this time, too, the wheat and wine farmers were not doing
so well, owing to the scarcity of labor. One industry only, the
breeding of merino sheep for the sake of the wool, received a great
impetus from the emancipation of the slaves, for it could be
carried on with fewer workmen than were required in agriculture.
The liberated slaves mostly flocked into the towns and villages,
where they lived a more or less idle life.


Sir Benjamin D’Urban had been specially charged to enter
into treaties of friendship with the native chiefs beyond the
colonial frontier. Both on the north and the east the border was
then in a disturbed condition; there were bands of freebooters,
mostly Hottentots, plundering the graziers on the northern
districts, and arrangements were made with a Griqua chief to
suppress them. He received a small subsidy and a number of
muskets, and in return he rooted out the thieves. Lord Charles
Somerset had devised a plan for keeping a large tract of land
between the colonists and the warlike tribes unoccupied, but, on
trial, this proved a failure. The natives made their way across it
without difficulty, and finally some friendly clans were allowed to
occupy it. Still the robberies went on, and reprisals were-
indulged in.
Finally a rupture, which had been long threatening, occurred,
and in December, 1831, between twelve and twenty thousand
warriors made a sudden rush into the colony, swept off nearly all
the cattle east of the Sunday River, and murdered evei-y white man
who could not escape. The unfortunate people had barely time
to flee to Grahams town, Bathurst, or some other place of refuge,
and were compelled to abandon everything. When intelligence of
this invasion reached Capetown, Colonel—afterwards Sir Harry—
Smith hastened to the frontier, and began to organise a force to
meet the invaders. The governor followed as speedily as possible,
and the burghers all over the colony were called out. As soon as
they could muster an advance was made into Kaffirland, the
raiders having meantime retired to the fastnesses of their own
country. They refused to meet the Europeans on the open
ground, and it was no easy matter to deprive them of then-
strongholds. They simply retired from one jungle to another
after resisting as long as they could, and re-occupied every place
that was not well guarded after it was taken.
To meet this difficulty Sir Benjamin D’Urban formed several
camps in commanding positions, from which patrols could be sent'


out frequently to scour the neighbourhood. It was the only plan
open to him, but the country was too large to be held in subjection
in this way by the force at his disposal. As soon as this
arrangement was completed the governor started with a
considerable army to recover the cattle. Messages were sent to
the chief offering peace if he would give them up, but for some
time he made no reply. Colonel Smith was then directed to
harass his country, and met with such success that the chief
himself came to the British camp and agreed to the terms
demanded.
The arrangement made by Sir Benjamin D’Urban for the
preservation of peace were in every way admirable, but there was
in Capetown, five hundred miles away, a small party which
• -i •
entirely disapproved of these plans. It was composed of only a
few individuals, but it had powerful support in London among the
missionary societies, which at this time were very powerful
politically. It maintained the theory that the natives were an
eminently docile and peaceably-disposed people, who could easily
be taught to do what was right, and who must therefore have
been provoked to take up arms by great wrongs and cruelties.
The utmost fear was expressed by its members that these natives
would perish if exposed to free intercourse with the white people.
To push these views the Rev. Dr. Phillip, one of the principal
members of the party, visited England, where he gave evidence
before a committee of the House of Commons, which was then
collecting evidence on the subject. His statements were received
at great length, and though they consisted largely of opinion, they
were allowed to outweigh that of the officers of greatest experience
in South African affairs. The views expressed happened to suit
the wishes of the then Secretary of State for the colonies, and he
at once resolved to undo all that Sir Benjamin D Urban had done.
In a despatch dated 26th December, 18?5, he announced that
the sovereignty over the country which had been occupied must be
withdrawn, because “it rested upon a war in which the original


justice was on the side of the conquered, not of the victorious
party.” He asserted that the natives had had ample justification
for the war in the conduct which had been pursued towards them
by the colonists and the public authorities for a long time, and
that they had been urged to revenge and desperation by the system-
atic injustice to which they had been the victims, and they had
a perfect right to extort by force that redress which they could not
expect otherwise to obtain.
The contents of the despatch spread consternation throughout
South Africa. Outside of the little missionary party in Capetown
there was but one opinion, that it destroyed all hope of the preser-
vation of peace and order, and placed life and whatever property
was left in the eastern districts at the mercy of the savage tribes
inhabiting the north. The British settlers at once sent an earnest
protest to England, with an appeal for a close investigation on the
border, but they could obtain no redress. Sir Benjamin D’Urban
also wrote condemning the new policy, but the only result was
that he was recalled. To the Dutch colonists in the frontier dis-
tricts who still possessed the means of moving, but
one course open ; to flee from British rule, and to seek a new
home somewhere in the vast wilderness to the north.


The Great Trek.
The difficulties of a large number of the Dutch settlers
moving away out into an unknown country were not by any means
so great as might be imagined Many of them were accustomed
to live in waggons, and to subsist to a large extent upon game, so
that moving deeper into the continent was in itself no great diffi-
culty. Before them was a great land swarming with wild animals
of every kind, and it is therefore no wonder they should move into
it with such powerful motives to urge them on. But indepen-
dently of the attractions presented on the other side of the fron-
tier, there were undoubtedly a number of genuine grievances at
home which had caused discontent. These included subjection to
an alien and, perhaps, rather unsympathetic government, and the
prohibition of their language in the public offices and the courts
of law; but the principal was the restraint put upon them in their
dealings with the natives. It was outrageous, they said, that a
man should not be allowed to do what he liked with his own
slaves, and still more outrageous that the blacks should be placed
on a political and social equality with the whites. If a new place
could be found, where the English influence would not reach, and
where only Dutchmen would be, all this might be changed. That
such a territory existed could not be doubted, for north of the
Orange was a large and fertile tract which had been almost de-
populated by native wars, and the British government had de-
clared, over and over again, that under no circumstances would
it enlarge its possessions in South Africa.
Accordingly preparations were made on a large scale, and all
over the frontier districts great waggons were laden with
household goods and provisions and ammunition, and bands of


people set out to seek a new home in the boundless north. Each
party was usually made up of families related to each other, and
the man of greatest influence in it was usually chosen leader, with
the title of commandant. The cattle, horses, sheep, and goats
were driven slowly on, and often, when the pasture was good, the
caravans would rest for weeks together. They went up from the
grass covered hills along the coast till they came to one or other
of the steep passes into the elevated basin drained by the Orange
and its numerous tributaries. With twenty or thirty oxen to each
waggon they struggled up, and then, crossing the watershed, went
on without difficulty down the long slope and across the wide
plains of the present Free State territory. Here they regarded
themselves as beyond English authority.
The first party that left the colony went north for some
distance, where it divided itself into two sections of about fifty
individuals each. One of these sections was cut off by a band of
blacks, and all its members murdered, except two children. The
other attempted to explore the country in the direction of Delagoa
Bay, but its cattle were attacked and killed by the tsetse fly, and
fever then made its appearance. Every man but one died, and
barely half the women and children recovered. The unfortunate
survivors, after almost incredible hardships, reached Delagoa Bay,
where they were treated with great kindness by the Portuguese
authorities, being provided with food and shelter until their
friends could send a vessel to rescue them.
The second party was much larger, and was under the
leadership of a man of considerable ability named Hendrik
Potgeiter. It moved slowly on until it reached the banks of the
Vet River, a tributary of the Vaal, where it halted, an
arrangement being made with a native chief for the right to
occupy a large tract of land. After a while Commandant
Potgeiter and eleven others went out to explore the country to the
north of the Vaal River, where they were very much pleased with
the fertility of the soil and the rich pasture. They believed, also,


that communication with the outer world could be opened through
Delagda Bay, so that the country seemed to offer every advantage
that could be desired for a settlement. In high spirits they set
out to return to their families, but on arriving at the spot where
they had last left their waggons they were horrified to find that
many of their friends had been massacred not long before. A
band of Matabele warriors had swept down on them and
murdered all who could not escape. Most of those along the Vaal
River, however, had timely notice, and when attacked were able to
draw their waggons round them, and so beat off their assailants.
The Matabele soldiers then returned for reinforcements.
Potgeiter immediately selected a suitable hill, and formed a
strong laager on it by lashing fifty waggons together in a circle and
filling all the open spaces, except a narrow entrance, with thorn
trees. He had not long to wait before he was attacked. The
Matabele rushed upon the laager with loud hisses, but were re-
ceived with a deadly fire from the forty men inside, and were
obliged to fall back. Again they rushed on regardless of death
and strove to tear the waggons apart, but could not. The forty
defenders of the laager were keeping up a rapid fire, for the
women in the waggons were loading spare guns for their use. As
a last resource the men of one of the Matabele regiments threw
their spears over the waggons, where eleven hundred were after-
wards picked up, and when this failed, they withdrew, but drove
off the whole of the immigrants’ cattle. They left a hundred and
fifty-five corpses outside the laager. The party in the laager were
now in great distress. Including servants, forty six of its mem-
bers had been killed, and the survivors were in a solitary waste,
without food, and without the means of moving. Fortunately,
however, the third band of emigrants had just encamped some dis-
tance off, and hearing what had happened, sent oxen to bring
away the unfortunate people and their effects.
It might have been thought that with such an experience
they would have abandoned the project, but instead of this they


resolved to attack the enemy and punish him severely for what h»
had done. One hundred and seven farmers mastered for this
purpose, and with them went forty half breeds and a few blacks
to look after the horses. A deserter from the Matabele volun-
teered to act as guide. So thoroughly had the country been de-
populated that not an individual was met until the borders of Mata-
beleland were reached, and the colonists were able to surprise the
southernmost military post of the Matabele one morning at break
of day. The chief himself was not there, and even the induna in
command of the soldiers was absent. This was a fortunate cir-
cumstance for the farmers. The soldiers grasped their spears and
shields and rushed forward, but volleys of slugs drove them back
in confusion, and there was no one of sufficient authority to restore
order They took to flight, and were hunted by the farmers until
the sun was high overhead, when it was computed that at least
four hundred must have been killed. The kraal was then set fire
to, and with nearly seven thousand head of cattle which they had
captured, the farmers returned. After this a camp was formed on
the Yet River, to which the name of Winburg was given in honor
of the recent victory. It was soon strengthened by the arrival of
numerous families from the colony.
On the 6th of June, 1837, a general assembly was held at
Winburg, when a provisional Constitution was adopted, this con-
sisting of nine articles. The supreme legislative power was
entrusted to a single elective chamber, termed the Yolksraad,
and the chief executive authority was entrusted to a commandant-
general. Fresh bands of immigrants were frequently arriving, and
some of them thought it would be better to go down into Natal
than to remain on the highlands of the interior. Peter Yys, the
leader of one of these bands, had visited Natal some time pre-
viously, and waxed eloquent when describing its beauty and
fertility. It was', therefore, resolved to send a party to inspect it;
and while this was away, a second expedition against the Matabele
set out. It consisted of one hundred and forty-five farmers, in


two divisions. The Matabeles, to the number of ten or twelve
thousand warriors, all splendidly trained, and as brave as any
troops that ever lived, were found on the river Marihua. The
odds were enormous, but the advantage of the farmers in their
guns and horses was so great that they did not hesitate to attack
a force which was to theirs as ninety to one. For nine days the
Matabeles tried to reach their opponents, but all their efforts were
in vain. The farmers were more than once nearly surrounded,
but their plans were so perfect that they were never quite en-
trapped. They had little else but dried meat to live upon, and
they had no resting place but the bare ground, with a saddle for a
pillow. Only the hardiest of men and horses could have carried
on aggressive operations so long.
The loss of the Matabele was great, so great that at the end
of the nine days they gave up the contest, and sought only to
escape. With their cattle, they fled to the north, and in the
regions beyond the Limpopo carved out a new land for themselves.
The farmers were too tvearied to follow them, and, indeed, they
could not have kept the field much longer in any circumstances,
so they contented themselves with seizing six or seven thousand
head of cattle, with which they returned to Winburg. After this,
the commandant-general issued a proclamation, in which he
declared that the whole country abandoned by the Matabeles was
forfeited to the immigrants. It included the greater part of the
territory of the present South African Republic, fully half of that
of the Orange Free State, and a large tract stretching away to the
borders of the Kalahari desert.
In all the world there is not a fairer country than the
pleasant land of Natal, stretching in steppes from the Drakens-
berg range of mountains, which bounds it like a mighty wall,
downward to the shore of the Indian sea. The coast belt is
-covered with sub-tropical vegetation, for it is heated by the warm
Mozambique current, which runs southward along it, and gives it
a higher temperature than is due to its distance from the equator.


Each terrace, as the traveller ascends, is cooler than the one
helow, though it is nowhere cold, and it is a well watered land.
Numerous streams, issuing from the Drakensberg and the fronts
of the lower terraces, rush along, in deep gorges, to the sea, and
carry off the superabundant moisture, so that it is also well
drained. Its soil is rich, its forests yield excellent timber, and
the grass in its valleys resembles a meadow. Its climate is every-
where healthy for Europeans. To the north is the land of the
Zulus.
When the party which had been sent to inspect it went down
into it by a pass through the mountains which they had discovered,
they found it very sparsely populated by natives, the only white
inhabitants being a few Englishmen on the coast who carried on
a small amount of trade with the Zulus. These had frequently
petitioned the Cape authorities to take possession of the country
and declare it British territory, but no notice bad been taken of
their requests. They therefore extended a warm welcome to the
Dutch adventurers, gave them a good account of the country, and
two of them, who had been thirteen years in the district and
spoke Zulu well, offered to accompany an envoy to the Zulu
capital as guides and interpreters.
The chief of the Zulus at this time was a man named Dingan,
whose capital was shaped like an enormous hollow circle, formed
by concentric rows of huts that served as barracks for the soldiers.
The interior space was the drill ground. The despot received the
envoy with every show of friendship, and said that his countrymen
might have the land of Natal to live in, but he must first
prove the friendship of the Dutch settlers by recovering a herd of
about seven hundred cattle which had been stolen by another
chief. The condition was accepted, and with a little trouble
possession was obtained of these without bloodshed. Nearly a
thousand white-tilted waggons then went in a long line down the
side of the Drakensberg, and halted on the banks of one of the
rivers. -


Preparations were then made to forward the recovered cattle-
to Dingan, and sixty-five Europeans and thirty Hottentot servants
accompanied them. These were received, as before, with every
show of respect and hospitality, and Dingan expressed himself
well pleased with the restoration ot his cattle. A paper, transferring
the territory of Natal, was drawn up and handed to the newcomers,
who were invited to go into the centre of the krael to partake of
some beer and bid adieu to Dingan. Completely thrown oft’
their guard, they went in and seated themselves on the ground,,
when Dingan suddenly gave orders to seize them, and immediately
a regiment of soldiers rushed in, drew them to the place of
execution, and smashed in their skulls with clubs. Not a single
farmer or Hottentot, nor even their English interpreter, was
suffered to escape.
A few hours later some ten thousand soldiers left Dingan’s
capital, and, after eleven days’ march, at early dawn one morning
fell upon the most advanced burgher encampment, and slaughtered
almost every human being connected with it. Forty-one white
men, fifty-six white women, one hundred and eighty-five white-
children, and about two hundred and fifty colored servants perished,
and the waggons and their contents were utterly destroyed. Every
white person in Natal must have met with a similar fate had not a
young man been awake at the time of the assault. He managed
to spring on an unsaddled horse, and rode with all speed to give
warning to the parties beyond. These had barely time to draw
their waggons round them when the Zulus appeared, but though
most desperate efforts were made by the savage warriors, the
simple laagers proved effective, and not one of them was taken.
When these events became known to the main body of the
farmers, it was resolved to send a force to punish the Zulus, and
two parties set out. The first was skilfully drawn into an ambush,
and found themselves surrounded by an immense number of the
savage warriors. They only withdrew with great difficulty, and
the loss of a number of killed and wounded, and all their led horses,


baggage and spare ammunition. The second party also was drawn
between the horns of a Zulu army seven thousand strong, and
although it fought well and inflicted enormous losses on the Zulus,
it was cut in two, one half annihilated and the other almost cut to
pieces.
But in a few months time yet another attempt was made to
break the power of the Zulu chief. A man of great natural ability
had arrived in Natal, this being Andries Pretorius. He at once
assembled a force of four hundred and sixty-four men, and marched
for Zululand. He took with him a sufficient number of waggons
to form a laager, and at every halting place these were drawn up in
a circle and lashed together. While on the march scouts patrolled
in all directions to guard against surprise. Dingan sent an army
of twelve thousand men to meet them, and on the 16th December,
1838, this attacked the invaders. For full two hours the warriors
attempted to force an entrance into the laager, notwithstanding the
terrible havoc caused among them by the fire of the farmers’ guns
and several small pieces of artillery. When at length they broke
and fled, over three thousand corpses w T ere lying on the ground,
and a stream that flowed past it was discolored with gore. It has
ever since been called the Blood River.
This event made a serious inroad into the power of Dingan,
who burnt his capital and fled. His army was still large, however,
and when the farmers retired he rebuilt it. But the Zulus began
to fight among themselves, a half brother to Dingan conspiring
for the chieftainship. In January, 1840, a great battle was
fought between the two, and the slaughter was so great that the
Zulu name was no longer a terror to the burghers. An enormous
booty fell into the hands of the conquerors, and about forty
thousand head of cattle was given to Pretorius, who had
favoured the victorious usurper. These were distributed among
the farmers in proportion to their losses, and went far to com-
pensate them for all their trouble.


The emigrant farmers had now freed South Africa, at all
■events for a time, from the destructive Zulu power, and had driven
the ferocious Matabele into regions unknown to Europeans. It
was, however, soon evident that they were less qualified for self
rule than for war, as the Government which they had established
was the weakest and most imprudent that ever existed. It could
not be carried on efficiently without a suitable revenue, and they
refused to pay any but the most trifling taxes. Every measure of
importance after adoption by the Volksraad had to be referred to
the burghers in primary assembly, and nothing but confusion was
the result. The public offices from the highest to the lowest, with
a solitary exception, were held by uneducated men, who could
barely write an ordinary letter, and who were, of course, ignorant
•of routine duties. Above all, the utmost prudence was needed to
avoid irritating the Cape Government, and they acted as though
they could afford to be indifferent to English opinion.
The elevation of the colored races was at this time a leading
idea in British policy, and when the news arrived in England of
the losses inflicted on the Zulus and Matabeles, it was at once
assumed that these races were perfectly harmless natives, who had
been shot down from a mere desire to seize the land owned by
them. The movements of the emigrants were therefore looked
upon with great suspicion, and when a chief who lived between
Natal and the Cape Colony was also attacked and severely treated,
a body of troops was sent to the frontier and an armed camp formed.
A resolution of the Volksraad to expel all the natives in Natal
brought things to a crisis, and the British troops, to the number
of two hundred and sixty-three, were ordered to march forward
and seize Durban, The Volksraad sent a protest, but no notice
was taken of it. Pretorius then assembled a number of farmers,
and a collision took place. The British troops failed to defeat the
farmers, and the latter closed in on them at Durban, where they
were beseiged for twenty-six days. At the end of that time
reinforcements arrived, and the burgher force dispersed.


Natal thus became a British possession. Some of the
farmers remained in it, but most of them packed their effects in
the waggons, and moved over the Drakensberg into the interior.
More than three years elapsed, however, before a government
under British officials was'established. In England the conduct
of the emigrants in thus persistently retiring from British
authority was regarded as very objectionable, and efforts were
made to compel the wanderers to return, and to prevent others
from abandoning the colony and joining them. These, on the
whole, were not very successful.


The sand River Convention.
It has been freqently remarked that South Africa is the grave of
British reputations, the inherent difficulties in connection with
governing it proving too much for statesman after statesman. To
a large alien population of Dutch settlers, who have always proved
themselves intractable and obstinate, there is added a particularly
ferocious native element, and time and again the colonies existing
there have had to bear the strain of wars which have tried all
their resources. As if this was not enough the home governments
have from time to time displayed a singular aptitude for
blundering in their dealings with South African problems, and
whenever they have had a man at the head of affairs there who
was really capable of dealing with them, it was long odds that he
would be recalled before he could effect any good.
In 184 G Sir Harry Smith, who had already seen service at
the Cape, was sent out as Governor of Cape Colony and High
■Commissioner of South Africa, and no governor was ever more
heartily welcomed there. Every section of the inhabitants hailed
him as an old and tried friend, and there was a general hope that
better days had set in. He was not long in making known the
changes which he came to effect. Hurrying to the eastern
frontier, he issued a proclamation extending the Cape Colony on
the north to the Orange River. The Dutch farmers gave him
a good reception, for many of them had fought under his command
thirteen years before, and they had always liked and respected
him. He made a number of arrangements for the government of
the different native clans, and on the 3rd of February, 1848,
issued a proclamation adding the whole of the territory between
the Vaal River, the Orange River, and the Kathlamba mountains
to the British dominions, under the name of the Orange River


Sovereignty. The Europeans in it were placed under th*
immediate rule of the Queen, and a staff of officials was appointed
to administer justice and collect taxes.
But the vast majority of burghers were indisposed to
submit to British rule in any form, and prepared to fight for the
independent government they had lived under for twelve years.
Sir Harry Smith had not long returned to Capetown when he
received intelligence that the farmers in the north of the Sover-
eignty had elected Andries Pretorius to be their commandant, and
had risen in arms, and that the officials and the little garrison
had been obliged to capitulate, with the exception of a number
who had been driven over the Orange river, and were then in a
camp at Colesberg. The energetic governor at once directed a
strong body of troops to march to the Orange, and followed
himself to take command in person. Commandant Pretorius
did not attempt to defend the passage of the river, but made a
stand at a strong position called Boomplaats, where, on the 29th
August, 1848, a severe engagement took place, which ended in the
defeat of the farmers.
All who were inveterately opposed to British rule now made
their way across the Vaal river, and there was no " attempt to
follow them. The Sovereignty government was re-established,
and a much larger garrison than before was left there. The
places of those white people who had moved away were filled by
fresh emigrants from the Cape Colony, many of whom were
Englishmen, so that from this time forward the European popu-
lation of the territory consisted of people either well affected to
the British Government, or not very bitterly opposed to it.
And now broke out another of the interminable wars with
the natives, known as the eighth Kaffir war. The frontier
districts were ravaged once more, and the burghers of all parts of
the country were obliged to leave their homes and take up arms.
Reinforcements were sent from England, and it was at this time
that the loss of the transport steamship Birkenhead occurred.


She was proceeding to Algoa Bay, when, in the middle of the
night, she struck on a reef running out from Danger Point. The
women, children and sick were put into the boats, while the
seldiers were drawn up on deck as on a parade ground. The sea
was swarming with sharks ; the shore was so far distant that the
strongest swimmer could not hope to reach it, and the wreck was
breaking up fast. Yet the men stood calmly there till the boats
with the helpless ones got away. Then, just as the ship fell to
pieces and sank, they leaped into the sea, and a few, by clinging
to floating wreckage, got to land. Four hundred perished.
It was not Sir Harry Smith’s fault, but his misfortune, that
the war had taken place. It would have been beyond the power of
any man to have staved it off permanently, for even the settlement
made at its close was only regarded by the Kaffirs as a truce. But
following the invariable custom in such cases, the secretary of
state recalled the governor. Sir George Cathcart, who was sent
out as his successor, took over the duty on the 31st of March,
1852, and thereafter directed operations in person until the con-
clusion of the peace.
For a short time after the restoration of British rule in the
Orange River Sovereignty, everything went on smoothly, and the
people appeared to be prosperous. But this satisfactory state of
affairs did not long continue. The British authorities became in-
volved in a quarrel with the Basutos, and Major Warden with one
hundred and sixty-two soldiers, one hundred and twenty farmers,
and from a thousand to fifteen hundred blacks set out to coerce
them. He was, however, drawn into a trap and suffered a crush-
ing defeat, and as all the available troops from Cape Colony were
then engaged in the eighth Kaffir war, there was no possibility of
reinforcing him. It has before been stated that the majority of
the farmers in the Sovereignty were well affected towards the
British government, but a strong minority were at heart opposed
to English rule, though not, up to this time, inclined to offer open
35


resistance. They knew that no help could be sent to Major War-
den, so as a matter of self protection they entered into an engage-
ment with the Basuto chief. They promised not to take part in
the hostilities against him, and he engaged not to molest them.
On both sides the agreement was faithfully kept. The Europeans
who were loyal to the British government, on the contrary, were
sought out by bands of plundering Basutos and robbed merci-
lessly. Some of the farmers now sent a request to Pretorius to
come and devise some plan to put an end to the prevailing
anarchy.
Since the battle of Boomplaats Pretorius had been living
north of the Yaal river, with a reward of £2OOO for his apprehen-
sion hanging over his head all the time. When urged to inter-
fere in matters in the Sovereignty, he wrote to Major Warden
announcing his intention to do so, but intimating that he would
prefer to make a treaty of peace with the British government, in
which the independence of his adherents should be acknowledged.
therefore reported to the high commissioner the
fact that he was practically helpless in the matter, and the gover-
nor. under the circumstances, decided to acknowledge the indepen-
dence of the Transvaal emigrants, as the imperial government had
announced their determination not to add another square mile to
the Queen’s dominions in South Africa. Two assistant commis-
sioners were therefore sent to make the necessary arrangements
with Pretorius and a number of delegates from the Transvaal
people. The conference took place on a farm in the Sovereignty,
and there, on the 17th of January, 1852, a document, known ever
since as the Sand River Convention, was signed. In this the
British government guaranteed to the emigrants north of the Yaal
the right to manage their own affairs without interference. The
convention was confirmed by the Secretary of State for the Colo-
nies, and was ratified by the Volksraad, so that thereafter the
South African Republic had a legal existence in the eyes of the
British government.


For some time the Imperial Government had been undecided
whether to retain the Sovereignty as a British possession or not,
but as soon as the news of the engagement with the Basutos
reached England, a decision was formed. The next mail brought
a despatch from the colonial office that the territory was to be
abandoned. To carry out this resolution, Sir George Clark was
sent out as special commissioner. He called upon the European
inhabitants to elect a body of representatives to take over the
government, but when the representatives assembled, they objected
in the strongest terms to be abandoned by Great Britain. The
special commissioner, however, was prevented by his instructions
from paying any attention to their remonstrances, and, although
the assembly sent two delegates to England to plead the same
cause, they met with no success in their mission. The result was
that on the ‘2Brd February, 1854, a convention was signed at
Bloemfontein, the capital of the Sovereignty, by which the terri-
tory was created into the Orange Free State.


The Orange Free State.
The form of government adopted by the men who were
suddenly called upon to frame the Orange Free State was repub-
lican. 'i here is a President, who is the principal executive officer,
and who is elected for a term of five years. He must carry out
the resolutions of the Yolksraad, and has no veto on its proceed-
ings ; while he is assisted by an executive council. The Yolksraad
is the supreme authority, and the President and state secretary
have the right to debate in it, but not of voting. The official
language is Dutch, and the courts of law are after the Dutch
pattern, though considerably modified. In each district is a land-
drost, or magistrate, and over all is a supreme court of judges,
who must previously have been qualified barristers.
When the British flag was withdrawn, the community was
split into factions, but the common danger forced them to unite in
choosing a President. Mr. Josias Hoffman was accordingly
selected, but in a year or two resigned, being succeeded by Jacobus
Nicolaas Boshof, a man of education, of high moral character, and
of considerable ability. Having had a training in official work in
the civil service of the Cape Colony, he was able to put the
different departments of the government in good order. He had
not long been in authority, however, before trouble again broke
out with the Basutos, and, after some fighting, which was by no
means to the advantage of the burghers, peace was arranged by
the giving up to that clan of a portion of the territory of the Free
State.
Shortly after this Mr. Boshof resigned, and was succeeded as
President by Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, son of the famous
Commandant General. He represented a strong party that desired
a union with the Transvaal Republic, but as there were many


conflicting interests in the way, besides a declaration of the high
commissioner that union would dissolve the convention with Great
Britain, every attempt at amalgamation failed. The Orange Free
State, however, was continually growing stronger. Arrange-
ments were made with different tribes for the possession of their
lands, and in a short time the whole territory between the Orange
and Vaal rivers and the Basuto border was in possession of white
people; and sheep and cattle farming could be carried on in a
large portion of it with greater profit than in any other part of
South Africa. The only drawback was the more or less continuous
fighting along the Basuto border.
In 1865 Jan Hendrik Brand was elected President, and made
a determined attempt to cope with the Basuto evil. Strong
burgher forces were put in the field and after two years of fighting
the power of the Basutos was broken. The Free State was in a
fair way of being able to dictate its own terms when the Cape high
•commissioner interfered. He declared that British interests would
not permit of the Basutos being dispersed over the country as
fugitives, and at their own request he proclaimed them British
subjects, and thus brought about peace.
The Republic sorely needed rest when the struggle was over.
Paper money had been issued to a large amount, and the notes
were greatly depreciated in value. Farming operations had been
neglected, and individuals as well as the State, had been compelled
to incur heavy debts. There was hardly a homestead in the land
which did not bear evidence that a crisis of no ordinary nature had
been experienced, and the loss of life had been considerable in
proportion to the population.
A little before this date, however, a discovery had been made
which created a perfect revolution in South African life. One day
in 1867 a child on a farm in the north of Cape Colony was observed
to be playing with a remarkably brilliant pebble, which a trader to
whom it was shown as a great curiosity, suspected to be a gem of
value. It was sent for examination to a qualified person in
39


Grahamstown, who reported it to be a diamond of twenty-one-
carats weight, and that its value was £SOO, Search was immedi-
ately commenced in the neighbourhood by several persons in odd
hours, and soon another, though much smaller, was found. Then
a third was picked up on the Vaal river, and attention was directed
to that locality. During 1868 several were found, though as yet
no one was applying himself to looking for them. In March, 1869,
the Star of South Africa was obtained by a trader from a Hot-
tentot, who had had it in his possession for a long time as %
powerful charm. It was a magnificent brilliant of eighty-three
carats weight when uncut, and was readily sold for £II,OOO.
From all parts of South Africa men now began to make their
way to the banks of the Lower Vaal to search for diamonds, and
trains of waggons conveying goods were to be seen on every high-
way to the interior. Some of the diggers were fortunate in
amassing wealth, but this was by no means the case with all.
Diamond digging, in fact, was like a great lottery, with a few
prizes and many blanks. But it had a great attraction, and
shortly many hundreds of adventurers from Europe and America
were engaged in it. The quiet, simple life of the South African,
farm and village had passed away, and a bustling, struggling,
restless mode of existence was rapidly taking its place. The
wealth of the country was enormously increased, for diamonds
soon attained a high place in the exports.
The southern bank of the lower Vaal was Free State territory,
but the ownership of the northern bank was disputed. Before the
discovery of diamonds it was regarded of so little value that no
actual government existed there, though a number of native tribes
all claimed the ground, and the Free State also regarded it as part
of its dominions. The consequence was that each mining camp
on that side of the stream formed a government of its own, and
a great deal of confusion and lawlessness was the result.
Finally, the whole question of the possession of a large extent
of territory, not only to the north but also to the south of the-


Vaal River, was submitted to an arbitration court, presided over
by Mr. Keate, Governor of Natal, and as a result nearly all the
diamond-bearing ground was declared to be within the sphere of
British influence. An armed force was sent to take possession of
it, and the Orange Free State officials withdrew under protest.
The territory, which was named Griqualand West, became a
Crown colony, but was afterwards annexed to the Cape Colony,
of which it now forms part.
President Brand then went to England to lay his case before
the Imperial Government. The reply that he received was that
it was necessary for the paramount power in South Africa to be in
possession of the diamond fields, but he was offered the sum of
£1)0,000 as compensation for any rights which might have been
violated by the arbitration award. The president wisely accepted
the offer, and with the money reduced the public debt of the State.
The sore feelings entertained by the burghers passed away, and
they began to reflect that perhaps after all it was better for them
to be relieved of the responsibility of keeping order among the
diggers. A diamond mine at Jagersfontein had been left to them,
and it was turning out much richer than had been anticipated.
Then they had all the advantages which the other mines offered as
markets for farm produce, so that they might make a great deal of
gain with no risk.
Since this settlement the Orange Free State has enjoyed a
high state of prosperity. Roads, bridges and good public buildings
have been constructed, and a system of publi : schools is maintained
by the Government. President Brand was elected again and again
until 1888, when he died in office, and was succeeded by President
Reitz. Owing to ill health, Reitz retired in 1895, and early in
1896 was succeeded by the present occupant of the office, President
Steyn. In 1890 the country contained seventy-eight thousand
Europeans, and one hundred and thirty thousand natives.


Transvaal Independence.
The vast tract of land north of the Vaal occupied by the
emigrant farmers who had crossed that river, contained ground
suitable for almost every variety of agricultural and pastoral in-
dustry ; and, though the circumstance was then unknown, mineral
■wealth not surpassed by any country in the world. Its eastern
and northern valleys, well watered and of great fertility, had, for
a time, a strong attraction for the settlers ; but experience proved
them to be less healthy than the open highlands, and they were,
therefore, partly abandoned. In some places the tsetse fiy
abounded, and this scourge of domestic cattle prevented settlement
in its neighbourhood until the large game was exterminated, when
it disappeared. The fever, too, that was once so prevalent on the
borders of the forests and streams in the lowlands, in course of
time became unknowa, as the ground was cultivated, and fcbe rank
grass burnt off before it decayed.
The farmers were only fifteen or sixteen thousand in number,
all told, so they naturally selected what appeared to them the
choicest spots, and no one considered it worth while to settle on
the great plains of the west. There was no such thing as union
among them. An attempt was made to form a common govern-
ment by the election of a single Volksraad for legislative purposes,
but with four executive heads, one for each of the principal
factions. This system, as may be imagined, was accompanied by
much disorder, and was soon succeeded by four republics, inde-
pendent of each other—Potchefstroom, Zoutpansberg, Lydenberg,
and Utrecht. Matters were not mended by this arrangement, and
it may almost be said that the white people beyond the Vaal were
without government at all.


A notable evil that resulted from this condition of affairs was
that the outskirts of the occupied area became a refuge to vaga-
bonds of every stamp, who resorted to them from every other part
of South Africa. Men capable of the most abominable cruelty,
but possessing the quality of brute courage, roamed about the
frontier, nominally as hunters and traders, but really as thieves
and outlaws. The country at this period was almost depopulated
of natives, the native tribes having been destroyed by the Mata-
beles ; only a few wretched remnants living along the margin of
the great Kalahair desert, or among almost inaccessible moun-
tains. The arrival of the white people and the flight of the
Matabeles gave new life to these. They could come out into the
open and make gardens and sleep in safety. The burghers were
masters and owners of the land, but in accordance with ancient
Dutch custom they permitted each little native community to be
governed by its own chief in all matters not affecting the ruling
race. The kraals were only subject to a light labor tax, and this
was lightly regarded until the dread of the Matabele was forgotten.
Life was now safe, and the occupants of the kraals multiplied
at a prodigious rate, besides which fugitives came in from the
regions beyond the Limpopo. Ten years passed away, and the
clans became so strong that they began to chafe under the
restraints imposed upon them by the white men, and to aspire to
independence. The farmers, however, although divided in some
things, stood shoulder to shoulder on the native question, and were
therefore able to suppress the various risings against their authority.
War cannot be carried on without cruelty, but in these contests acts
were sometimes performed by the whites which exceeded the
limit regarded as permissible by civilized nations. It should be
remembered, however, that great provocation was occasionally
given, white women and children being murdered in cold blood,
corpses mutilated, and captives put to death by torture.
Early in 1857 the Potchefstroom faction adopted a new
constitution, under which Marthinus Wessel Pretorms became
43


President. Ln the following year Zoutpansberg gave in its
adhesion to this constitution, and in 1860 Lydenberg and Utrecht,
previously united, were also incorporated, so that the whole
country north of the Vaal became one republic. Pretorius was
accepted by all parties as the legally elected President, Paul
Kruger being appointed commandant-general, or military head..
Notwithstanding these measures, the state was shortly in a bad
way. There was no money in the treasury, and the government
was actually at one time unable to raise sufficient funds to pay
the carriage of ammunition from Durban. The roads were bad,,
the rivers were unbridged, there were no public offices worthy of
the name, and the salaries of the officials, trifling as they were,
could seldom or never be paid when they were due. Commerce
was carried on chiefly by means of barter, as gold and silver were
exceedingly scarce. Still on the farms anything like want was
unknown, for the flocks and herds throve and increased in the rich
pastures, and the fertile soil produced grain and vegetables and
fruit in abundance.
It was about this time that the award made by Go-
vernor Keate as to the diamond-bearing territory was an-
nounced, and the manner in which the case for the Trans-
vaal Republic was conducted gave great dissatisfaction to the
burghers. President Pretorius was obliged to resign, for the
Yolksraad maintained that he had exceeded his authority in
making the agreement with the High Commissioner, and Thomas
Francis Burgess was elected in his place. This President was an
able and active man, but his ideas were far too advanced for the
men he had to govern, He went to Holland and tried to float a
loan for the purpose of constructing a railway from Pretoria to
Delagoa Bay, and the sum of £90,000 was actually raised. With
this money material was purchased and sent out to South Africa,
but as no more could be borrowed, it was left to rust and rot away
on the open beach. When he returned he found that during his
absence a powerful chief named Sekukuni had again attacked the


farmers, and that it was necessary to call out a strong force to deal
with him.
But the President was not by any means popular, chiefly
owing to a general belief that he was wanting in religious
principles, and when a large commando was called out to punish
the insurgents, the burghers did not respond with anything like
enthusiasm. One strong place was taken, but this success did not
give heart to the farmers. An attempt to take another stronghold
failed, chiefly owing to the conduct of the burghers themselves,
and then there was a perfect stampede homewards, which all the
efforts of the President could not repress. Some days later the
fugitives reached Pretoria, and no hope of suppressing the rebel-
lion speedily was left.
The Volksraad was hastily convened, when it was resolved to
■engage men wherever they could be obtained, at <£s a month,
rations, and a farm of four thousand acres when the disturbance
was quelled. To meet the expense heavy war taxes were imposed.
But the country was quite unable to bear this strain. The
ordinary charges of government and the interest on the public
debt could not be met, much less an additional burden, And so
the whole administrative machinery broke down. The Republic
was really in a pitiable state, without money or an army, with re-
bellion triumphant, and a general election approaching, which it
was feared might be attended with civil war.


The Annexation.
While things were in this condition Sir Theophilus Shepstone,.
previously secretary for native affairs in Natal, was sent by the
British Government to Pretoria with very large powers. It is
admitted by everyone that a country is entitled to interfere with a
neighbour whose weakness is a cause of common peril; but whether
Great Britain was justified in taking possession of the South
African Republic is a question which it is almost impossible to
answer. One of the reasons assigned by Sir Theophilus Shepstone
for the action he took was that the country was in danger of being
overrun by the Zulus, but the farmers never expressed a fear
of this danger, and thought themselves quite able to meet
Cetewayo’s warriors. The residents of the villages and towns,
who were principally English and Germans, however, requested
the commissioner to declare the country a British dependency, as
the only remedy against anarchy, and the farmers did nothing
to oppose him and his slender escoi’t. The government of the
Republic managed to patch up a kind of peace with Sekukuni, but
otherwise matters remained in the condition of anarchy described
until the 12th of April, 1877, when Sir Theophilus Shepstone
issued a proclamation declaring the country a British possession,
and thereupon assumed supreme control, the President retiring
under protest.
A considerable military force now entered the Transvaal ter-
ritory, as the country was re-named, and apparently the new
Government was firmly established. Trade revived, money flowed
in, and property of every kind increased in value. But the farmers
were dissatisfied with the loss of their independence, and sent Paul
Kruger and Dr. Jorissen to England to endeavour to get the
annexation withdrawn. The deputation failed in its purpose, the


British Ministry believing that a large proportion of the people of
the country, if not the majority, were in favour of British rule.
As a proof that this was not the case, petitions were sent round
against annexation, and these were signed by over six thousand
five hundred persons—practically the whole rural population.
Another deputation, consisting of Paul Kruger and Pieter Joubert,
with Eduard Boch as secretary, was now sent to England, in
hope that with so strong an argument in its favour it would meet
with success. But it returned disappointed, and thereafter
repeated declarations were made by the highest officials in South
Africa that under no circumstances would the British flag be
withdrawn from the Transvaal.
Sir Theophiius Shepstone was personally not disliked, and if
anyone could have made the farmers contented under British rule
he would have done it. But in March, 1879, he was succeeded as
administrator by Sir Owen Lanyon, a man of haughty disposition,
who was incapable of even attempting to conciliate the country.
The feeling now rapidly gained ground among the farmers that if
peaceable means to obtain the restoration of independence did not.
soon succeed, an appeal to arms would be made. In 1880 Mr.
Gladstone succeeded the Earl of Beaconsfield as Premier of Great
Britain, and as he had, when in Opposition, denounced the
annexation as unjust, the farmers not unnaturally thought that he
would give them back their independence. For a while, therefore,
the agitation almost ceased.
As soon as it was known, however, that Mr. Gladstone de-
clined to withdraw the British flag, the discontent came to a head.
A great meeting was held, at which Kruger, Pretorious, and
Joubert were elected a triumvirate to conduct the government,
and the Volksraad resumed its functions as the supremepporer.w r er.
It was decided that Heidelberg should be the capital until Pretoria
could be recovered, and there*, on the 16th of December, 1880, the
flag of the Republic was hoisted again.


The Revolt.
In considering the history of any portion of South Africa, it
is absolutely essential to bear in mind as a factor always present
the intense racial hatred which the Dutch have always felt to the
English and English ways. To suppose that this feeling is con-
fined to the Transvaal is to show a complete ignorance of the facts,
it has assumed its most rancourous form in that land, but it exists
in Cape Colony, in Natal, in the Orange Free State, and the
Dutchman carries it with him wherever he goes. The treaty
which gave the Cape to the British was received by the Dutch
element with sullen discontent, and no amount of concession,
conciliation and protection from savage races during the greater
part of a century has softened this discontent in the slightest
degree. The existence of this feeling during the earlier years of
British domination is not greatly to be wondered at, a similar
condition of affairs for a long time prevailed amongst the French
Canadians ; these have, however, in return for persistent justice
and equality, at last yielded a generous loyalty. The difference
between the French Canadian and the Dutch Afrikander is that
the latter is, and always has been, an irreconcilable.
To suppose that this antagonism is the result of past or
present misgovernment is idle. In the dominions under the
government of the High Commissioner, all white races are equal in
the eye of the law, and the privileges which the Boers of the
Transvaal refuse to Englishmen are freely granted by Englishmen
to Boers all over South Africa. It has its origin in the fact that
the Boer, being in the main a pastoralist, desires to be left in
undisturbed possession of vast tracts of land where, with the aid of
a few blacks, he can manage his herds and flocks, and realise his
ideal of happiness, which is to be left alone. Accordingly, he


resents all intrusion of strangers, and what is generally understood
as industries. To his mind there is nothing incongruous in the
fact of some fifty or sixty thousand ignorant Boer squatters
occupying and monopolising a country half as large again as
Victoria. There is one other feature in the character of the Boer
which cannot be passed over without remark. In religion he is a
fanatic of the most bigoted Presbyterian type; the Bible is to him
an absolute fetish ; he loves to compare himself with the patriarchs
of old, and freely interprets biblical incidents which please him as
being applicable to himself. On top of all, this apparently dull,
heavy simpleton, is a keen hand at all business, and with all his
religion not over scrupulous. Long ago Canning wrote —
“ In matters of trade
The faults of the Dutch
Are granting too little
And asking too much.”
BRUNKER’S SPRUIT.
On the 20th of December, ISBO, a convoy was despatched
from Lydenberg to Pretoria, a distance of 200 miles through
difficult country. It was escorted by the headquarter companies
of the 94th Regiment, and was under the command of Lieu-
tenant-Oolonel R. Philip Anstruther. No actual declaration of
war had been made, and the troops with band playing and colors
flying were marching along with that blind confidence which
has so often preluded trouble in South African wars. There
appears to have been no advanced guard, and such was the feeling
of security that the colonel had permitted many of his men to
sling their arms. The road approaching Brunkers Spruit is very
precipitous, and the convoy being heavy, progress was very slow.
The colonel, accompanied by Conductor Egerton, had ridden
forward with a view to selecting a camping ground, when his
attention was attracted by the sudden silence of the band. On
wheeling bis horse round to discover the cause of this silence he
found that about 150 mounted Boers had suddenly appeared from be-


hind the adjacent rocks and formed up on the left of the road.
From this party a flag of truce approached, and a sealed letter was
handed to Colonel Anstruther, who read it aloud. This letter
stated that the Republic having been declared in Heidelberg, and
the Dutch people being resolved to maintain it, any movement of
the British troops was prejudicial to their interests, and that if
the colonel advanced beyond the Spruit, they should consider the
act a declaration of war, and hold him responsible for the
consequences.
As might have been expected, Colonel Anstruther’s only reply
was that he had been ordered to proceed to Lydenberg, and he
would obey orders.
Immediately on the return of the Dutch flag of truce to his
party, a murderous fire was opened on the British by concealed
foes, who, from behind the numerous rocks in the vicinity, and in
perfect safety to themselves, shot down the almost helpless soldiers.
It was an affair of minutes. The Boers from their hiding places
aimed specially at the officers, who were all wounded, at the oxen,
and at the ammunition waggons. The number of privates who
were killed and wounded has been variously stated, ranging from
30 to 200. Sergeant Bradley put the figure at between 30 and 40
killed and 70 or 80 wounded, and this agrees with the report of
the general commanding, who, on 24th December, wrote —“ 120
killed and wounded ; rest taken prisoners ; colours saved.”
As the men escorting the long convoy came up, and after
them the small rear guard, they were all made prisoners of war,
after which Commander Joubert gave permission for the men to
take rations, pitch tents for the wounded, and work the -water
carts. Permission was also given to Conductor Egerton to arrange
about getting doctors and ambulances, and Sergeant Bradley was
allowed to accompany him on this mission. Egerton took this
opportunity to secrete the colours of the regiment about his
person, and thus these trophies, bearing the names of many bril-
liant battles, were saved to the regiment. Some idea of the


Ivantages of the position which the Boers had taken up
eparatory to this fight niay be formed from the fact
iat they lost only one killed and five wounded. The
irviving British were marched off to Heidelberg, but
took them three days to reach that place, as the Boers corn-
led them to assist in drawing the heavy waggons, yoking them
ke oxen for that purpose. It remains to be stated that these un-
irtunate victims of official obstinacy and incapacity were nearly
il young recruits, many of whom had hardly learned the range of
leir own weapons, and few of whom had that coolness and
isource which becomes a second nature to the seasoned soldier.
Thus the long threatened war had at last begun in sad
irnest, and if there had been no premonitory symptoms, no meet-
igs, no threatenings or declarations, the British could not have
less prepared or apparently more surprised. Colonel Sir
wen Lanyon, 0.8., who was in command at Pretoria, had been
liged to weaken his force in order to put down resistance to the
Dvernment at Potchefstroom, and had summoned the 94th from
f'denberg, with what results we have seen. The Boers, acting
th promptitude, now boldly attacked Potchefstroom in force,
id although they were repulsed with heavy loss in killed and
iunded, they succeeded in making prisoners of Major Clarke and
unmandant Raaf.
But they now made a still more serious move. With a strong
rce, numbering some 2,500, they attacked and took Pretoria
self, the Administrator and his officers being compelled to take
luge in the fort. Utrecht and Standerton were invested, and a
>dy about 200 strong actually penetrated into Natal and took up
strong position on the Transvaal-road, while sending their
ounted patrols a long way towards Newcastle. To meet all these
lergetic measures the British had a mere handful of troops,
altered over a vast and difficult country, and surrounded by a
)stile population. But how is it possible to wonder at this un-
•eparedness when we find the genei'al commanding writing home


to the Secretary of State for War, under date of 17th Novem
(thirty-seven days only before the battle), “My personal opin:
is, that the Boers will not have recourse to force.”
Before leaving the Brunker’s Spruit incident, it is necessary
point out the equivocal conduct of the Boer leaders. On the 1c
December, only five days before the battle was fought, a leti
was sent to Colonel Lanyon, signed by Kruger, the two Jouber
Pretorius, Jorissen and Boch, stating that the Dutch had form
themselves into a Republic and demanding to be placed in
position to administer affairs, threatening in default to take
arms, but also declaring that their only object was to preserve t’
sanctity of the -convention entered into with Her Majest}
Government. Within a few hours of the fight, the South Africt
Republic was declared at Heidelberg, with Kruger as Presider
Joubert as Commandant, Jorissen as Attorney-General, and Boc
as Secretary of State. It is evident that this government In
been formed before the affair at Brunker’s Spruit, that the lett
was only to keep Lanyon amused, that the battle had been decide
on in order to force the hands of both parties to the dispute, an
further that whatever reply Anstruther might have given i
Joubert’s demand, the result would have been the same.
LAING’S NEK.
At every turn of this unfortunate campaign, we are confronte<
with the complete organisation of the usually slow-moving Boers
and the utter want of preparation, foresight, or even knowledge, or
the part of the British. Of course the former had sympathiser:
ah over the land, but the latter had been in possession of the ad
ministration for nearly four years, and during that time shoulc
have been able to acquire sound information on the subject of the
resources which the Republicans could command. Even the cor-
respondents of the great London newspapers differed widely in
their estimates of the Boer strength. The “Standard” placed it
at 10,000 and increasing, the “Times” as low as 5000 effectives


Che British officers were as ignorant of the true position as these
lewspaper men, and from all the evidence that appears to the con-
rary, no steps were at any time taken to ascertain the real
strength of the enemy, while during the whole period of the occu-
pation the topography of the country seems to have been consid-
ered unworthy of study.
On the 24th January, Sir George Pomeroy Colley marched
mi Newcastle with a small force, numbering in all less than 1000
men, his object being to relieve Potchefstroom, and to assist the
garrison in Pretoria. This column was made up of small bodies
from quite a number of different corps, and included a few men of
ie Naval Brigade, while with the column were six guns, in addi-
tion to two Gatlings. After two days’ marching through an almost
impassable country, the advance guard of the British came in
sight of the enemy massed in a very strong position on the Drak-
ensburg mountains. The British formed a camp about three
miles off and this was entrenched, Joubert commanded the
Dutch and as usual had so cleverly located his forces, that it was
quite impossible for Colley to judge of his real strength. It
should be explained that the Drakensberg range attains in places
a height of 9000 feet, and that the particular spot where Joubert
was posted forms an angle which is the boundary of the Trans-
vaal, the Orange Free State, and Natal. And here there is a pass
now too well known as Laing’s Nek.
The 28th was wet and misty, but at an early hour the troops
were afoot, and in the highest of spirits marched out to attack the
Boers. Once again it was to be demonstrated that all the bitter
lessons of South African warfare had been thrown away on the
martinets of the British Army. This is not a military book, and
it is not proposed to follow the movements of the little army
during this unhappy day. For the average reader it may suffice to
say that the general idea was to turn the enemy’s position by a
movement to the right, and with this intent the Royal Artillery
began to shell the heights and ravines on that side, while the


infantry under the command of the General himself, crept up th
slopes held by the Boers. The pedantry of the War Office had, o
course, given these soldiers white helmets and such uniforms a
made them ready victims to the deadly fire of the enemy, and the;
suffered severely during their arduous climb. By 10 o’clock the]
had approached a ravine in which the Boers were strongly placed
and it was determined to try and clear this with the bayonet. T(
aid in this movement a squadron of mounted men rode off to thi
extreme right with the idea of taking the enemy in flank, but i
tremendous fusillade from the ravine showed that the enemy hac
divined the intention, and half the saddles were empty in a fev
seconds. The squadron retired, reformed, and with desperah
valour again charged, with the result that it was practically
annihilated.
In the meantime the infantry had reached the edge of the
ravine, where they were met with a withering fire, both in front
and on the right flank—the unfortunate helmets again doing the
enemy good service, to the skilled Dutchmen under shelter, it
became a regular battue The game was too unequal, and after a
three hours’ conflict the remnants of the British fell back on their
camp, where a mere handful of men had been left in charge.
To enumerate the losses in such an affair is not profitable.
Bravery enough and to spare there was, of course ; when white
men fight, and especially when two such tenacious races as the
British and the Dutch come into conflict, bravery is taken for
granted. There was bravery at Balaclava, but as the French
generals who saw the historic charge remarked, “ It is magnifi-
cent, but it is not war.”
Sir George Colley, after the engagement, sent a brief tele-
gram to the Secretary of State for War to the effect that his
attack on the pass had been repulsed with heavy loss, the extent
of which was not known, and that he had retired to his camp
near the Nek, where he was awaiting reinforcements.


The closest calculations, which have been made from various
conflicting statements, give the British loss as about one-third of
the attacking force; the Boer loss was undoubtedly heavy, indeed
Joubert admits as much in his despatch to Kruger, but the actual
figure is not known ; neither is the strength of the Dutch army,
this being variously computed at from 1,000 to 3,000 men. An-
other proof that the British general did not know what he was
about to undertake when he so gaily marched to destruction.
In view of the present conditions, it is well to note that a
week after this defeat Colley received from Lord Kimberley (Colo-
nial Secretary) a despatch warning him that in the event of his
being able to recover ascendancy in the Transvaal, all questions
of future administration, and the treatment to be awarded to
those who had risen in arms against the Government, were to be
reserved for the consideration of the Ministry at home.
INGOGO RIVER.
When the news of the disaster at Laing’s Nek reached
England there was a great to do about the immediate despatch of
reinforcements, but in accordance with its usual practise of never
being ready for any emergency, the War Office was not in a
position to meet the demand made upon it. The various regiment*
were below strength, and the battalions it was intended to send
had to be filled by drafts of volunteers from other regiments, with
the usual results. Fortunately, the 92nd Gordon Highlanders
had been sent from India after their fighting in Afghanistan, and
two companies of these veterans had arrived in time to strengthen
Colley’s weak camp on Prospect Hill. But the Boers, who knew
perfectly well what they were about, and were faithfully served by
their scouts, watched every ford of the Buffalo River, and with
true military instinct conceived the idea of cutting off the British
from their base of supplies at Newcastle. This place was held by
a small force, mostly invalids, who occupied a little fort called
Amiel. But the stores were there, and it was necessary that a


convoy should reach the camp; the trouble was that its necessary
escort did not, as a matter of fact, exist. On the Bth February
a considerable convoy was ready to start from Newcastle, it was
loaded with stores and ammunition, and it was so far ready that
the very oxen were inspanned, it only wanted the one thing need-
ful—the escort. All this did not escape the watchful Boers
and they came down in strength to intercept its passage.
General Sir George Pomeroy Colley, with half the letters of
the alphabet at the end of his name, never seems to have thought
it probable that the Dutchmen would be guilty of such conduct, so
he marched out of his camp with 400 or 500 men and three or
four guns to keep the road open and assist the convoy into camp.
In the course of the march it was necessary to cross the river In-
gogo, on the further bank of which were a series of open grassy
ridges which had to be traversed. Behind these ridges were the
unrivalled marksmen of the new Republic, and the slaughter—there
is no other word for it—began. The British without any cover, the
enemy practically invisible, and what has been aptly called a rifle
duel, that was the position. The big guns were comparatively use-
less for the gunners were slain the moment they stood up, indeed
the cannon were virtually silenced shortly after the action com-
menced, In the face of this terrible position the dogged British
maintained the unequal fight until nightfall, when the fire of the
enemy slackened. The casualties were: —killed 68 rank and file,
wounded 68, missing 8 ; officers killed 8, wounded 4, drowned 1.
The Boers reported their loss as 20, and as our surviving soldiers
asserted that they never saw more than the heads of the enemy,
the number stated is probably near the mark.
With nightfall preparations were made for an immediate
retreat. The guns were spiked, rifles smashed, ammunition
buried, horses shot. The wounded were left on the ground, there
being no means of carrying them off, but the surgeons to their
eternal honor, remained with them and did what little they could.


It is certain, however, that many bled to death during that
night.
It rained in torrents when the retreat began, and the water
in the Ingogo was up to the men’s waists, but the miserable
remnant of fugitives reached the camp early in the morning, and
they were followed by the gradual arrival of six ambulances laden
with wounded, whom the faithful surgeons, with the consent of
the Boers, had been able to forward. Another portion of the
wounded were taken into Newcastle.
After the troops had recrossed the river the rain continued in
torrents and it soon became impassable, thus Colley was saved
from pursuit, but to all intents and purposes he was a prisoner in
his camp until relieved. At the same time the scattered detach-
ments of British troops in Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Lydenberg,
and Htanderton were beleagured by the Boers. On the 9th, the
day after the fight, the telegraph between the camp and Newcastle
ceased to carry messages, and as a large body of the enemy had
worked round to Biggarsberg, between Ladysmith and Newcastle,
the position of the latter town became very critical. Every pre-
caution was taken, the defences were strengthened as far as
possible by the few engineers in the place, and the men were ready
to stand to arms at a minute’s notice. Shortly after this the
wire between Ladysmith and Newcastle was also cut, the obvious
intention of the Dutch being to prevent all news of the relieving
column which was now on the march from reaching the
.garrison.
THE RELIEVING COLUMN.
At midnight of 14th and 15th February, General Sir Evelyn
Wood’s column, consisting of about 2,500 men of all arms, left the
camp at One Tree Hill, a few miles from Biggarsberg, the pre-
caution being taken of having mounted scouts on either flank.
A small advance guard consisting of Hussars and Natal Police
was sent forward to reconnoitre, as it was strongly suspected that


at some point the enemy would seek to bar the march. They
went some distance beyond the Ingagane River and found the
country clear, so choosing a strong position, they awaited the
arrival of the main column. This crossed the river without delay,
and then a halt was called for a brief rest.
When the march was resumed, Sir Evelyn Wood and Major
Hartnell joined the advance party, and after proceeding three or
four miles received information from the scouts that a strong
body of the enemy was posted above the Horn River. This force
fell back on the advance of the Hussars, and the British then
camped, the distance between the two forces being about two
miles.
At four o’clock next morning, the troops were again on the
move, the Boers showing themselves, but offering no serious
opposition, and at noon the column entered Newcastle, to the
great joy of the small garrison
This rapid and successful march quite confounded the plans
of the Dutch, who had no time to entrench themselves in any
advantageous position; but General Wood had always been famed
for his quick and skilful marches. In the Zulu war he had acted
on the plan of sparing his cattle rather than his men, on the
ground that the latter possessed the most power of recovery, the
system worked well and received further endorsement on this
occasion.
On the following day General Oolley came into Newcastle
and reported the road to his camp as being clear, but no instant
steps could be taken, as it was absolutely necessary to give the
relieving column some rest.
Meantime the Boers who had been assembled above Horn
River were quietly working their way back to their headquarters
at Laing’s Nek. They made one or two small demonstrations,
but these were evidently for the mere purpose of covering the
retreat.


General Wood understood the value of rest for man and beast,
but he was not the man to waste time, so, in a day or two, he
took a squadron of his Hussars and a detachment of Gordon
Highlanders and started out to make a bold reconnaisance in the-
hostile Transvaal. He crossed the Buffalo River, and here he
left his Gordons as a support; then, with his troopers, he rode for
some thirty miles, and found the Wakkerstroom road quite clear of
the enemy. This was highly satisfactory, and after the riders
had covered nearly seventy miles they rejoined the Highlanders
on the left bank of the Buffalo River.
On the day when General Colley reached Newcastle, a council
of war had been held, but what was then determined on is un-
known. Within a week of his relieving the Newcastle garrison
Sir Evelyn Wood was back at Pietermaritzburg, no doubt on busi-
ness connected with the plan of campaign. It is necessary to
bear this fact in mind when considering the story of what was to
come.
General Colley crossed the Buffalo with an escort of Hussars
to reconnoitre the left flank of the Boer position where it rested
on the river. He found that they had fortified their front, where
he had made his last attack, but they seemed to have neglected
their flank, under the impression that nature had made this im-
pregnable. Observing this weak point in the defences of the
enemy, the English general suddenly conceived a movement so
bold, that the most daring of leaders might well have hesitated to
attempt it.
The operations he designed were to lead to the crowning
disaster of Majuba Hill, his own death, an ignominious capitula-
tion by the English Government of the day under the guidance of
Gladstone, and long years of troubles which hare only culminated
in the present day.
since Ingogo both sides had been preparing for a crucial trial
of strength, the Boers had been entrenching and in a
unobtrusive way, gathering supplies an I receiving reinforcements^


The British were burning with desire to avenge the repulses they
had met with and were preparing for an effort which should have
decisive results. But the impatience of Colley ruined ail.
MAJUBA.
On the evening of the 26th February, a body of troops were
under arms for a secret expedition, they numbered under 600 all
told, and were made up of Gordon Highlanders, a portion of the
68th regiment which had already suffered so cruelly, some rifles
and 60 or 70 blue jackets. They carried with them three days
provisions and a liberal supply of ammunition. At 10 o’clock in
silence the column moved out of camp, and then only did the men
learn that their destination was the lofty elevation known as
Majuba, and which completely commanded the left of the enemy.
The night was dark, and though the way was at first over compara-
tively level ground, the country was quite unknown, and at the
base of the hill obstacles multiplied quickly till the route became
almost impassible. The soldiers had the assistance of Kaffir
guides, but the path became so narrow and steep that the climbing
had to be done in single file, and in some places they had to crawl
up on hands and knees. Occasional halts were made, and after a
toilsome march of six hours, they reached the foot of the steep
aclivity itself, in shape something like a sugar loaf, a sharp peak,
hence the Dutch name of Spitzkop, by which it is known.
The description of this last part of the ascent as given by
survivors is simply appalling, for experienced mountaineers
unencumbered and in broad daylight, it would.have been no small
feat to achieve the ascent, but at night, encumbered with arms,
provisions, water bottles, and other impedimenta, it is a wonder
how the soldiers wore through it. The general and his staff were
indomitable, and where officers lead, British troops will follow.
As Colonel Stewart and a few men emerged from the scattered
boulders and deep gulleys, having gained the summit, day was just
Beginning to break. The others followed as best they could, and


by 5 a.m. the first part of what has been justly called “ a desperate
and most rash expedition ” had been achieved.
In the course of the journey, the general had left, at different
points, a company of Rifles, one of Highlanders, and a troop of
dismounted Hussars, thus materially weakening the small force at
his disposal for the final effort. These men had orders to proceed
forthwith with entrenchments.
The crown of Majuba Hill may be roughly described as
saucer-shaped. It is about 800 yards in diameter, and the rim
forms a sort of rough breastwork so long as the defenders can
hold it; but if an enemy is in sufficient force to seize that rim, it
is the story of Sedan repeated.
The troops had undergone superhuman labours for seven
consecutive hours, and as fast as they reached the final pointy
they flung themselves down upon the grass to snatch half an-
hour’s sleep, in which they only followed the example set by the
general himself. Many military critics consider that this was a
fatal mistake, and that even then a supreme effort should have
been made to throw up some rough entrenchments.
As the daylight strengthened, Laing’s Nek could be seen
some 1500 yards below the position, which completely enfiladed
the enemy’s camp. It is agreed on all hands that the idea of
seizing Majuba was one of the most brilliant ever conceived by a
commander, and had the force which General Colley took with
him been at all adequate to the task he set before them, the
enemy must have speedily retreated from Laing’s Nek, and the
whole course of history might have been altered.
The rising sun soon betrayed to the watchful Boers the
presence of red coats and glittering steel on the crest of a natural
fortress which completely overlooked their position, and the
British could distinctly perceive the intense excitement which the
discovery caused in the opposite camp. Even up to this time
there prevailed in many quarters the preposterous idea that the


Boers were at heart cowards, and the bustle and confusion exist-
ing in their camp was attributed to panic!
{Sentinels were posted round the summit of the hill, and a
portion of the 58th, with the Naval Brigade, formed a reserve in
the centre of the depression. And here was made a tactical error,
w 7 hich probably was the chief cause of the final catastrophe. The
men were stationed not on the extreme brow of the hill, but be-
hind the rim of the saucer, the impression evidently being that
the Boers could never take the height in the face of a deadly fire.
By this time the water-bottles carried were all empty, and the
men were parched with thirst, but a well was dug by an officer
and water found. No attempt was made to throw 7 out men as
skirmishers on the outer slopes, although there was excellent
cover, a fault of which the enemy quickly availed himself. This
may have been because General Colley had so few men, or it may
have been a continuance of that presumptuous self-confidence
which had been so fatally conspicuous throughout the campaign.
It is necessary here to refer to a most important element in
the struggle going on between tw T o brave races. The British
Army at this time was in a transition state, vast changes had
been made in its organisation, and these had been in operation
long enough to injure if not cripple the old system, but not long
enough to mature the new. As one of the results of these changes
many of the regiments at home were practically only skeleton
regiments, which when suddenly called upon for active service,
had to fill up with drafts from other corps, or worse still, with
half-drilled recruits. Of such recruits Colley’s soldiers largely
consisted. Now it is well known that one of the commonest
faults with raw troops is an almost incurable tendency to waste
ammunition. This, bad enough where the w 7 aggons are close at
hand, is ruin itself where the supply is limited, and every round
of the utmost value. Out of the 75 rounds per man with which
the expedition had started, a considerable portion was wasted by


the impatience of these new hands, who commenced taking pot
shots at the Boers, long before they came within range.
The apparent confusion in the enemy’s camp continued but
there was a great deal of method in their madness. They could
be seen manning the entrenchments on the Nek, driving their
■cattle and horses in from the slopes, while some could be seen
inspanning teams to waggons. All this did not prevent them
from sending a large body round the base of Majuba Hill, where,
dismounting, they commenced their usual tactics of creeping up
the ascent, taking advantage of every scrap of shelter on the way.
Having gradually worked into some nook within range of the
British, they in perfect security fired upwards with deadly
precision.
The enemy having with their usual skill established a
strong line of skirmishers in secure places, began to develop
the attack on a bold scale. An intimate knowledge of the
■country enabled them to form a somewhat accurate idea of the
strength of the opposing enemy, and with prompt determination
they resolved on a great attempt to cut off the whole force.
From the camp at the Nek they issued forth in one con-
tinuous stream until the whole base of Majuba was surrounded,
and then as they gradually climbed upwards, the circle surround-
ing the small body of defenders contracted. There were no
reinforcements on the way, and indeed it is doubtful if the
position could have been held under any circumstances for an
hour longer than it was. The moment the Boer circle was
■complete Colley’s handful of men were doomed.
An instance may be given which will afford the reader some
idea of the shooting capacity of the Boers. At a comparatively
early stage in the conflict, Commander Romilly, of the Naval
Brigade. w r as standing close to the General on a part of the
plateau supposed to be outside the range of the enemy’s fire ;
suddenly white smoke was seen to issue from a clump of bushes
more than half a mile away, and the unfortunate Romilly foil


mortally wounded, a bullet having gone completely through his
body. The incident is said to have had a depressing effect on
the young soldiers. This may be doubted, at the most only a
few could have been eye-witnesses of the fatality, and all seasoned
warriors agree that in the passion of battle there is no time nor
inclination for thinking, reasoning, or striking dramatic attitudes.
The desire is to kill, and after the first few moments even recruits
fight well. Armies undoubtedly are sometimes affected by panic
when some great assault is made in force, but the death of
individuals passes unnoticed for the time during the heat of
battle.
About mid-day the fire of the Boers slackened somewhat, and
the anxious Commander probably hoped that they were about to
draw off and give his wearied fellows at least breathing time.
But as a matter of fact they were all this time quietly and
stealthily adding to the strength of their attacking line. Almost
unobserved, and at any rate without great risk to themselves they
crept up and up until by about 1 o’clock every stone and every
bush, especially on the right, hid a skilled marksman, the halt of
whose life had been devoted to this kind of warfare. Against this
class of fighting the ramrod training of Aldershot was of little
use. The Boers knew their work, the British did not know
theirs.
Suddenly, in an instant, as it were, the whole slope was
covered with an overwhelming cloud of attacking Boers, who
seemed to rush upwards with the impetus of a great ocean wave,
the skirmishing line of the British was too weak to stem the
assault, and gave way. That a few of the younger men, some
mere youths, shrank at this period is indisputable. But the
veterans and the Naval Brigade men stood like a wall, and three
times in succession repulsed their fierce foes. The fire these men
sustained was simply murderous, but as they fell one by one, they
contracted their line, drawing up shoulder to shoulder, and
encouraged each other with shouts. At this time there was a cry


for bayonets, a vain cry now when it was a rising flood which sur-
rounded the few survivors. Neverthless bayonets were fixed, and
a small semicircle formed to make a last stand, the phlegmatic
Boers did not advance on the cold steel, romance and chivalry was
not in their line, but with business-like sternness, they shot down
the soldiers where they stood.
The story draws to a close, Colley had been standing in the
centre of a small group which held a slight elevation. All at
once he staggered wildly, and fell. He had been shot through
the brain.
It was now all over. With one wild tumultuous rush and
shouts of exultant triumph the position was carried by the over-
whelming weight of the assailants, and the British arms had
sustained a defeat which has left behind it a rancour more bitter
than many reverses of far greater political importance.
When the final catastrophe arrived, the remnants of the gal-
lant band broke and fled, the Highlanders, as might be expected,
being among the very last to leave the hill. A few—a very few—
got back to the camp at Mount Prospect, and amongst these were
the Rifles who had been left as a rear guard. Colonel Dunn
Bond found himself in command, and made all preparations for a
vigorous defence, but no attack was made.
In order not to lose the thread of the narrative, it will be well
to state here the losses, so far as they can be ascertained. As
usual, even military men, who might be expected to have at their
command official documents and expert knowledge, cannot agree
as to the exact number engaged, and still less as to the casualties.
A comparison of the figures given by those who ought to
know would seem to point to the fact that after leaving his small
detachments on the road, Colley had under his command when the
engagement began something under 500 men all told. Of these,
after his terrible march, an appreciable proportion would be, for a
time, at any rate, ineffective. The Boer encampment at Laing’s
Nek was very strong. How strong nobody knows ; it is perfectly


certain that neither Colley nor his staff knew, and apparently, at
that time, the British leaders did not consider it necessary to in-
quire. There is no evidence of any really effectual system of
scouting being employed by the British, while these latter could
not make a movement without its being immediately known to
their opponents. The Boers knew perfectly well that they need
not fear any attack on Laing’s Nek from Prospect Camp, and that
they were at liberty to concentrate their strength against Majuba
Hill. That they effectually surrounded the hill at a considerable
distance from the summit goes to prove that they must have em-
ployed nearly or quite 3000 men in this supreme effort. The odds
from the very first were too great.
Taking Colley’s force as 500 (an outside estimate), the
casualties were—Killed, 84 ; wounded, 131 ; prisoners, 57 ; miss-
ing, 18; total, 285. As corroborating the statement that the
Boers knew their business, it was shown that their loss in taking
this almost impregnable position was not more than 50. The
prisoners were taken to Heidelberg and were well treated there,
the officers being liberated on parole.
THE ARMISTICE.
On receipt of the news of the Majuba disaster and the death
of General Colley, Sir Evelyn Wood, who was still at Pietermar-
itzburg, was sworn in as Governor of the colony. Previous to this
event there had been some half-hearted approaches to negotiation,
in which neither side believed, but the course of events gave some
reality to the efforts of certain well-meaning parties. Finally, a
conference was arranged between Sir Evelyn Wood, Major Fraser,
and Captain Maude, for the British; while the Boers were repre-
sented by the two Jouberts and Foucher.
After considerable debate an armistice for eight days was
agreed to. This was to commence on the 6th of March and ter-
minate on the 14th. The object was to give time in which the
terms of peace might be discussed, and also to enable Kruger to


reach the scene of deliberations. The terms of the armistice were
sufficiently severe for the British—they were allowed to retreat
from the camp at Prospect Hill, but no forward movement was to
be made, nor were reinforcements to make any advance from the
positions they held at the moment. On the other hand the Boers
were not to advance from the Nek, The British were also allowed
to send eight days’ provisions to the small garrisons beleagured
by the Boers.
These negotiations were conducted with less acerbity of feel-
ing than might have been expected. But the temporary rest was
very acceptable to both sides. Of the small force under the com-
mand of General Wood eight hundred were in hospital, while the
troops in camp were literally worn out with continuous labour,
id were suffering, in addition, from terrible weather. On the
other hand, the Boers were beginning to feel some of the inherent
defects of their system. They had left their wives, children and
farms, to fight in what they considered a just cause, and had held
well together. But disintegration, the ruin of all volunteer forces,
had undoubtedly set in, and the armistice offered these men the
welcome chance of a flying visit to their homes.
Meantime General Wood’s strength was steadily increasing,
and it w 7 as estimated that before the armistice expired he would
have under his command about 5000 picked men-a force in-
comparably stronger than any that had been at the disposal of his
impetuous and unfortunate predecessor, but which would have
been under his command could he have controlled himself for
only fourteen days.
In order that the reader may understand the bearings on
the events of to-day of what followed, it may not be out of place
to state that these 5,000 men included no less than 1,200 cavalry,
3,500 bayonets of crack regiments, and the Naval Brigade. There
were 14 guns, besides the gatlings of the sailors, thus in the two
arms which the Boers most dread, cavalry and artillery, Wood
was very strong. At this juncture the General was joined by his


old friend and comrade, Colonel Redvers Buller, V C., now Com
mander-in-Chief of the largest British Army which has taken tin
field since the Crimean War.
Thus the new Governor was in a position to deal with tin
Dutch on at least equal terms, and of course his power could hav<
been increased to an indefinite extent if the party in power a:
home had been in earnest when they pretended that they desire*
to preserve the Transvaal to the British Empire.
From the very day on which Sir Theophilus Shepstone
annexed the Transvaal, on the plea that its weakness in the-
presence of Sekukuni and other powerful chiefs was a danger to
the British possessions, there had been a strong party who had
never ceased to declaim against that act as a political crime.
Those were the days when it was still an open question in certain
schools of thought whether colonies were not encumbrances and
sources of weakness rather than of strength. The school of
politicians who propagated this doctrine also taught that m any
and all circumstances of dispute, the British people were always
in the wrong. The rubbish talked at public meetings in those
days is almost unreadable in these—people assembled at Exeter
Hall and sympathised with “poor Cetewayo,” probably the
greatest man-slayer who ever lived. It was the same in many
other instances, the sickly sentimentalists of the time, aided by
the rhetorical efforts of so-called missionaries, always justified the
enemies of the British Empire. It was this spirit that led to the
sacrifice of Gordon, and of this spirit Gladstone was the apostle
and high priest. He was now to sacrifice the Transvaal and leave
to this generation a burden tenfold heavier than the one he ought
to have faced.
Fully aware that he would not be effectually backed by the
Home government, Sir Evelyn Wood felt himself in an embarrass-
ing position. To add to his difficulties the whole country was
flooded with torrents of rain, and his supports could scarcely be
expected to move by the time the armistice expired. The Boers-


were exultant, and their natural coarseness of fibre began to show
itself in certain tyrannous conduct to the people of unprotected
places, notably at Utrecht, where the inhabitants had shown
British proclivities.
Negotiations continued, the Dutch openly proclaiming that
virtually they had the whole of South Africa behind them, and
that nothing less than the restoration of absolute independence
would satisfy them. Terms were submitted to Lord Kimberley,
the Colonial Secretary, but they were so preposterous that even he,
saturated with “ Little Englandism,” rejected them, and the
armistice was extended by three days.
By this time there was a good deal of irritation on both sides,
and an angry discussion ensued as to the extent of relief to be
granted to the small places, which, as a matter of fact, were
besieged by the Boers. However, General Wood carried the point
on this matter.
It will surprise no one acquainted with British politics to
learn that Lord Kimberley suggested that sovereign specific for all
human ills, a Royal Commission, with the promise of an amnesty.
This was agreeable to some of the Boer leaders who had un-
doubtedly sailed near the line, Joubert especially being responsible
or some outrages which are prohibited by civilized nations even
in war time.
The crucial moment was now at hand, Wood, instructed by
the Home government, demanded the evacuation of Laing’s Nek,
which was equivalent to asking that those who had hitherto been
victorious should acknowledge themselves beaten.
Joubert knew as well as anybody that the ardour of his
volunteers was cooling, and that the dissolving process had, as a
matter of fact, already weakened his power. Wood personally did
not want peace, for he knew that every day improved his position,
but the two governments did, and in the end Dutch tenacity, not
to say obstinacy, beat what was then called British generosity, but
69


what was in fact a surrender of colonial interests to the necessities
of party government.
In considering the conduct of those who held highly responsi-
ble positions at this time, it must never be forgotten that scattered
over the Transvaal, there were little bodies of British who were
dignified with the name of garrisons, but which were in fact
absolutely helpless; hardly able to hold their own ground, they
could not assist each other, and on a small scale Lucknow was
reproduced. Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Standerton and Lydenberg
were all in this plight, and it is idle to suppose that the knowledge
that all these places were practically at the mercy of the Boers,
did not at that time greatly influence the final terms of peace.
Many of these little towns went through all the horrors of siege,
their sufferings were known to those in authority, and could not
be lost sight of by them when considering the situation as a
whole.
Amongst these sieges that of Potchefstroom commanded par-
ticular attention, for when, after an indomitable resistance, the
small garrison in the fort surrendered to overwhelming strength,
it was found that the attack had been made during the truce, and
an undoubted instance of Boer treachery was established. Atten-
tion is only drawn to this incident because it shows that the Boers
were much like guerillas, and that even Joubert had not much
authority outside his own camp. However, the outrage of storm-
ing a place during an armistice was too great to be passed over by
either side. General Wood threatened to march on the place,
Joubert apologised, and admitted that Kronje had broken faith.
To-day Kronje, who all his life has been a bandit, is one of the
chosen leaders of the Transvaal.
PEACE.
Looking back after all these years, it cannot be doubted that
General Wood was acting under very strong pressure from the
Colonial Office when he finally came to terms with the Boers..


The order seems to have been “ Make Peace ” —on good terms if
you can, but make it. Never was the folly of putting off obvious
duty more fully exemplified. From the moment the treaty was
signed to this hour its interpretation has been a matter of dispute.
The British meant that the Transvaal should have internal inde-
pendence, but that in all matters outside her borders she should
be dependent on the Foreign Office. The Boers understood that
they were to be a sovereign State absolutely free to act as they
chose, which in their case meant to work steadily and persistently
for the extinction of British power in South Africa. The treaty is,
of course, to be read by those who desire to do so; its terms are
at first sight explicit enough, but diplomatists would lose their
vocation if they drew up any agreement which was not capable of
two or more interpretations.
In the end the Boers withdrew from their camp at Laing’s
Nek, and the British troops sullenly refrained from further action ;
the sprinkling of soldiers scattered about the various townships
returned to the colours, and the hot blood which had been engen-
dered began apparently to cool.
When the Boers broke up from the Nek, they mustered three
thousand strong, and their bitterest enemies must admit that for
the particular kind of warfare in which they were engaged, their
betters could not be found anywhere. On the other hand, the
British commander found himself for the first time since the out-
break of hostilities at the bead of a force which could have done
something effectual.


The Rise of the Rand.
The peace made after the fighting round Majuba and Laing’g
Nek was not entirely satisfactory to the Boers. On the one hand,
it gave them the right of self-government, but on the other it left
a number of matters of dispute in abeyance. Accordingly, an
early effort was made to substitute for the Convention of Pretoria
another agreement, and in 1884 three delegates (Kruger, Du Toit
and Smit) visited London, and there a second Convention, known
as the Convention of London, was drawn up and adopted, in place
of the first. By this, the boundaries of the South African
Republic were slightly enlarged. All British control, except in
regard to foreign relations, was finally withdrawn; and the
Republic was set up as an independent power, subject only to a
shadowy suzerainty. But for one thing, ail would now have gone
well. The country was poor, but so long as native wars could be
avoided, paid its way; and whatever trouble it got into, it was
unlikely that the British authorities would have again interfered.
Suddenly, however, gold, and gold in large and ever-increasing
quantities, was discovered. At once was witnessed a repetition of
the rushes to California and Australia which occurred half a cen-
tury ago. The Transvaal was not a poor man’s field, but there
was work in plenty, and an enormous accretion to the white
population at once took place.
In the early days, when the emigrant farmers trekked across
the Yaal River, their sole idea was the acquisition of land for
stock raising ; and no thought was given to the possibility of dis-
covering minerals. In later years, about 1854, it was reported
that gold had been found, but the Government, apprehensive of
an influx of foreigners, prohibited prospecting under a heavy


penalty. In 1867, however, the existence of auriferous formations
was made known by a German explorer, and soon afterwards all
restrictions on prospectors were removed. In 1872 the first gold
laws were published, declaring all mineral rights to belong to the
state, and offering rewards for the finding of payable gold fields.
The discovery of the Leydenberg alluvial fields was shortly after-
wards claimed by three Englishmen, and digging operations were
successfully carried on at a number of other places. But the out-
put was small, and although a number of nuggets of considerable
size were found, the industry made very little progress.
In 1882 attention was directed to the Kaap plateau and
valley, and two years later the district was proclaimed a gold field.
In 1886 a claim named the Sheba mine gave some phenomenal
yields, some of the ore going eight ounces to the ton, this result
causing quite a rush to the locality. Barberton became the centre
of operations, and suddenly expanded into a town of considerable
size, with hotels, stores, residences, and public buildings. Since
then it has decreased in population, the output of gold not having
been maintained. The Sheba mine still keeps the leading position
among the claims there, the vein of quartz being of exceptional
width and richness.
The discovery of the auriferous “banket,” or conglomerate
beds at Witwatersrand in 1885, however, threw the Kaap fields
completely into the shade. For some time previously a search for
gold had been made in the surrounding tract of country, and some
rich ore was milled from a reef named the Confidence. A pros-
pector then found the conglomerate beds, and they were pointed
out to several individuals and parties ; test crushings were made,
and these proving satisfactory the government was communicated
with. The Witwatersrand, or, as it was shortly called, the Rand,
was proclaimed a public goldfield on the 20th September, 1886.
A mining camp, known as “ Ferreira’s,” formed of waggons, tents,
and huts quickly sprang into existence on the southern slope
73


of the Rand, and the output of the precious metal rapidly
increased.
Prior to this the properties on the Rand were of com-
paratively little value. The farms were bare pasture land, ranging
in price from £350 to £750, and a sum of £lO,OOO would have
sufficed to purchase them all. Mining leases over portions of
them were obtained on very favorable terms by the pioneer pros-
pectors, but as capitalists and the representatives of syndicates
appeared upon the scene, the value of the land traversed by the
conglomerate beds rapidly increased in value, many of the Boer
owners disposing of their farms for from £7,000 to £70,000. One
of the farms, being government ground, and having a central
position, was selected as a site for a town, and laid out in streets,
squares, and building lots. These building lots or stands were
offered for sale on ninety years leases by public auction in 1886
and 1887 ; they numbered in all about 1,800, of the size of 50
feet square, and realised over £50,000. Prices at the outset
ranged from a few shillings up to £2OO per stand, and some of
them, situated in the principal thoroughfares, have since been
sold for from £4,000 to £7,oi'o.
Johannesburg was now fairly founded, and the development
and exploitation of the conglomerate beds was so rapid that even
Australia or California can hardly show such an instance of a
great city springing up, as it were, in a single night, as was wit-
nessed in the case of the capital of the Rand. Estates were pur-
chased by men who had the capital to introduce machinery, and
soon thousands of heads of stampers were at work all over the field.
At first there was a doubt about the permanence of the reefs,
many persons holding that the beds would not continue to any
great depth. But as time went on shafts were put down many
hundreds of feet, and mine management passed from the hands of
the inexperienced to really competent men, applying improved and
economic methods of mining, and the newest processes for the
treatment of ores.


The production of gold, which began in a small way in the
latter half of the year 1887, steadily progressed, during 1888, from
7,000 ounces to 26,000 ounces per month. During 1889 it rose
to 39 000 ounces per month, by 1890 it was 50,000 ounces per
month, and by June, 1892, it had reached the 100,000 ounces per
month. Johannesburg was greatly excited when this record was
reached, and crowds assembled at the “corner,” where Mr, Lionel
Phillips, the President of the Chamber of Mines, made the
announcement.
During these five years of mining development and progress,
the camp which formed the embryo township of Johannesburg
was transformed into a large and well-ordered city. In its first
stage, the buildings were generally of a temporary character, but
no sooner was the permanency of the conglomerate beds demon-
strated than the place was alive with brickmakers and builders;
and comfortable dwellings, blocks of business offices, theatres,
hotels, clubs, churches and other public edifices sprang into exist-
ence. Nearly all the material required for these structures, as
well as the plant, machinery and stores for the mines, had at this
time to be brought from the seaboard, and for 800 miles of the
distance were carried by the slow, cumbersome, and expensive
agency of the ox-waggon. The railway only made its advent to-
wards the close of 1892.
It is almost impossible to overrate the mineral wealth of the
Rand, the prospecting already done having shown it to be practi-
cally inexhaustible. In 1892 the Rothschilds sent a well-known
American mining engineer to inspect and report on the field.
This gentleman, after giving the figures on which he based his
estimate, calculated that in twelve miles of country there were a
hundred million tons of ore, averaging twelve-and-a-half dwts. of
gold to the ton. This, he said, would yield sixty million ounces
of gold, having a value of £215,000,000. The country already
prospected outside the twelve miles showed half as much again,
and the wealth already visible was, therefore, £325,000,000.


Thus a few square miles of country were estimated to give a
greater return than has been given by the whole of the colony of
Victoria since gold was first discovered in it.
Every year now saw the city growing larger and larger. By
leaps and bounds the gold yield went up, and by leaps and bounds
Johannesburg expanded. In 1897 gold to the value of eight and
a-half millions sterling was produced, this being about one-fifth
of the production of the whole world ; while since 1890 the in-
crease per annum has been at the rate of a million sterling a year.
In fact, so regular is the gold, and so plentiful the ore from which
it is obtained, that it is simply a question of how many stamps
can be laid down ; as these increase, so does the yield of the pre-
cious metal.
No wonder that the people poured in. They came from the
Cape Colony, from Natal, and from every other part of South
Africa. They came from every country in Europe ; adventurous
Englishmen, hard-headed Scotchmen, Welsh miners by the hun-
dred, and Irish workers by the thousand. America sent engineers
and scientific chemists; and Australia sent experienced gold-
seekers who had learnt their work in the mines of Bendigo and
Ballarat, Even Germany and France and Russia were repre-
sented, and speculators from Antwerp and Hamburg jostled Jews
from Vienna, and dealers from everywhere. It is not to be sup-
posed that these people presented the characteristics of the early
frontier towns of the United States, that men went about in their
shirt-sleeves, wearing riding boots, on which spurs were con-
spicuous, and with revolvers obtrusively showing from hip-
pockets. They were, on the other hand, a civilised and hard-
working population; speculators, business men, clerks, miners,
carpenters, painters, bricklayers and shopkeepers. The centre of
the city, where business was concentrated, would have passed for
Cheapside, London, Collins-street, Melbourne, or a slice cut bodily
from New York or Chicago.


If the chief object of the Boers in coming to the Transvaal
was to obtain independence, the principal object that the new
comers had was to make money. The Boers wanted independence
first and money afterwards ; the inhabitants of the Rand wanted
money first and independence if they could get it as well. It was
not long, however, before the influx to the mines was so great that
the original Boer population was far outnumbered. This is esti-
mated to be from 70,000 to 80,000 all told ; the white persons of
other nationalities resident in the country in 1898 were supposed
to number between 130,000 and 140,000. Johannesburg itself, in
1898, had a population of 50,000 whites and 50,000 blacks.
There were still plenty of tin shanties, while even tents were not
unknown, but large public buildings showed in the main streets,
such as the Hospital, the Stock Exchange, the Chamber of Mines,
and the Rand Club; and many private residences fully on a
par with those in any city in the world. In the main streets were
large shops where stores of every kind could be purchased, while
millinery from Paris and dresses from London were displayed
behind plate-glass windows. Ladies of the richer class drove out
in the best English carriages with liveried English coachmen, and
their drawingrooms were as comfortably and luxuriously furnished
as those of any English town.
The advent of the mining population, and the train of other
outsiders brought with it, was viewed with mixed feeling by the
Boers. On the one hand, the cosmopolitan crowd which gathers 1
on the Rand was looked at with alarm, not untinged with
jealousy ; on the other hand, the wealth which was being brought
forth from the earth had a remarkable effect in revivifying the
country. Before the advent of the Rand the entire revenue of
the Republic was only £75,000 per annum, and great difficulty
was found in making this small amount cover the ordinary ex-
penses of government. Any extraordinary call on the national
resources, such as a native war, threatened serious disaster.
Directly the despised Uitlanders began to come in, however, the


yield from tlie taxes went up with a rush. The treasury was soon
overflowing, salaries were paid in full and with remarkable prompt-
ness, and there was plenty of money for everybody. As if this
was not enough, new forms of taxation were sought out, forms
which always fell with crushing severity upon the Uitlander, and
left the Boer severely alone. In a few short years the revenue
rose from £75,000 a year to over £5,000,000 a year. In addition to
this, concessions and monopolies were sold with a free hand, and
not a Boer connected with the government but could make large
sums of money in a more or less illicit way.
But while willing to obtain all this benefit from the new
comers, the Boers were by no means altogether pleased. It
seemed as though all the privileges of self-government, which had
been won so dearly by the great trek, by the innumerable native
wars, by the hard work on the boundless veldt, and by Majuba
and Laing’s Nek, were likely to be lost. The whole Boer popula-
tion was but a handful, and bid fair to be swamped by the
Uitlanders. There was only one thing to do—to treat them as
aliens, and to deny them all political power. Accordingly, a
system was initiated by which these skilled and educated white
people—in many instances the pick of the world for knowledge
and enterprise—were treated with considerably less liberality than
are the natives of India by the British government. In India, on
the Legislative Councils of the Viceroy and of the Governors of
the provinces, there is always a proportion of native members;
and native members have lately been accorded the right of ques-
tioning the financial expenditure of the government. There are
native judges even in the High Courts, there are native members
in the administration, and there are more than 700 native munici-
palities in Indian towns. In the Transvaal municipal rights have
not yet been granted to a single town, and while 130,000 Uitlanders
contributed last year £5,000,000 to the revenue of the country,
they not only had no control over the expenditure, but actually
had no official means of expressing an opinion on it. Nay, more.


by a recent press law, they may be prevented from expressing
disapproval, even in the newspapers
The mining industry is not represented in the government,
■even by a Dutch official, and the single way in which the Uitlander
may have any voice at all in affairs is in the second Volksraad.
After expressly renouncing his former country, and after becoming
liable to military service, the Uitlander may obtain a vote for a
body which has no control over the finances. Even the Kaffirs in
Cape Colony and the negroes in the United States have greater
freedom than the Uitlanders in the Transvaal.
But not only is all political power denied to residents of the
Transvaal who are not Boers, not only is every measure which is
introduced and passed in the Transvaal Parliament intended to
exalt the Boer power and reduce the Uitlander to a condition little
better than slavery, but a special effort is made to harass those
who speak English.
The government uses every possible pretext to taboo and veto
the use of the English language. Not a single legal document
can be registered or deemed valid unless printed in Dutch,
although both the contracting parties may not know a word of
that language. Every official document and notice issued by the
government, even in Johannesburg itself, is printed solely in
Dutch. British suitors in the courts are forbidden to use their
own language, and are compelled to plead and defend their cases
in the Dutch language through the use of interpreters—a costly
and dangerous method of procedure. In the Transvaal, in actual
practice, no government grants are made to schools where
English is used as the medium of instruction; and this too though
nine-tenths of the revenue of the country is contributed by the
English speaking population. The English language, written or
spoken, is as severely checked and discouraged as are English
goods and English manufactures.
While the Dutch treat the British—for the great majority of
the Uitlanders are British—in this way in the Transvaal, the


British pursue a totally different course in Cape Colony and
Natal. There every native of the soil is given full political power
as a matter of course, while aliens can obtain it after a very brief
residential probation. So freely is this power used that large
numbers of Dutch members of parliament are elected in Cape
Colony, and at the present time there is a Dutch ministry in office,
kept there by the votes of the Dutch members. The fiscal system
is fair to all, and there are no taxes placed on a particular class.
Not only is this so, but it is specially recognised that the Colony
contains a large Dutch speaking population. The two languages
—English and Dutch—are placed on a perfect footing of equality ;
and either may be spoken in the legislature. In the civil service
a knowledge of both tongues is imperative, and no person is
appointed to the smallest office unless he can speak each fluently.
In short, the Dutch and the English people are equally free, have
equal rights and privileges, and have an equal interest in their
common country.


The Cry for Reform.
It was not long before these repressive measures began to
cause an intense friction among the new comers, and more
especially among the English speaking new comers; but never-
theless it was some time before any steps were taken to have them
removed. At the beginning of the rush many of the Uitlanders
did not, undoubtedly, contemplate staying in Johannesburg for
any length of time. The permanency of the field was doubted,
many of them had left their wives and families in Cape Colony,
Great Britain, or Australia, and their main idea was to make some
money and get back again. This is nearly always the case in a
new country. Of the hundreds of thousands of persons who came
to Australia in the early fifties, a very large proportion contem-
plated a return to Europe at an early date. As time goes on,
however, interest in the new land grows, while that in the old
land decreases. Wives and families are brought out, new ties are
formed, property is acquired, and in a few short years all idea of
return is abandoned.
So it was on the goldfields of the Transvaal. The climate is
a good one, the Rand showed an unusual permanency for a gold
field, and thousands of the Uitlanders began to look upon the
country as their future home. It was then that efforts began to
be made to remove or mitigate the restrictions which had been
imposed. At first these were of the most tentative description,
but as no notice was taken of them they became more and more
pronounced. It has been alleged by the Boer government, and
even by some of its sympathisers in England and elsewhere, that
this movement was entirely a capitalistic one ; that its object was
to enable the Uitlanders to obtain a greater and greater grip on


the mineral wealth of the country, and that the mere workman,
the miner, the shop assistant and the carpenter had no part in it.
It is absolutely certain that this is incorrect. The whole cry for
reform originated with the men who had to work with their hands
for their living.
There were two very good reasons for this, first, the workman
had nothing, or very little, to lose by agitation; secondly, the
capitalist had everything to lose. If there was political trouble it
was a comparatively easy thing for the former to pack his carpet
bag and seek elsewhere that freedom denied him in the so-called
Republic ; but with the stroke of a pen President Kruger could
cancel all the mining leases, while all the property which had
been created, the blocks of offices and shops, the private resi-
dences and the clubs were almost equally at his mercy. It was
not, therefore, until the capitalists were actually goaded into
agitation that they fell into line. But tax after tax was placed on
them. Restriction after restriction was brought into force. All
remonstrances were of no avail, and at last the monied men placed
themselves at the head of the movement.
It must, however, be understood that the whole agitation was
for a long while kept strictly within the limits of the constitution.
Public meetings were held, and petitions were promoted. These
were alike treated with contempt. A few promises were made,
and vague hopes of redress were held out at some future time ; but
nothing came of it, and the oppression got steadily worse. In
May, 1894, a petition for the extension of the franchise, signed by
18,000 inhabitants, was presented to the Volksraad, and was re-
ceived with shouts of laughter, being, of course, promptly rejected.
In April, 1895, a similar petition, signed by 32,500 residents, was
presented, with a similar result—one member going so far as to
say that if the Uitlanders wanted redress they would have to fight
for it.
At last things reached a crisis, and an organised body, called
the National Union, was formed at Johannesburg for the purpose


of defending the rights of the Uitlanders. At a meeting of this,
held in 1894, the demands of the Union were set forth in a formal
and elaborate manner; it being stated, at the same time, that no
resort to force was contemplated. These were issued in a mani-
festo, which was, later on, elaborated as follows by the Chairman
of the Union, Mr. Charles Leonard, and published to the people
of the Rand. It was as follows :
THE NATIONAL UNION MANIFESTO.
If I am deeply sensible of the honor conferred upon me by
being elected Chairman of the National Union, I am profoundly
impressed with the responsibilities attached to the position. The
issues to be faced in this country are so momentous in character
that it has been decided that a review of the condition of affairs
should be placed in your hands, in order that you may consider
matters quietly in your own homes. It is almost unnecessary to
recount all the steps which have been taken by the National
Union, and I shall, therefore, confine myself to a short review of
what has been done.
The Three Planks.
The constitution of the National Union is very simple. The
•three objects which we set before ourselves are :—(1) The main-
tenance of the independence of the Republic ; (2) The securing of
equal rights; and (3) the redress of grievances. This brief but
comprehensive programme has never been lost sight of, and I
think we may challenge contradiction fearlessly when we assert
that we have constitutionally, respectfully, and steadily prosecuted
our purpose. Last year you will remember a respectful petition,
praying for the franchise, signed by 13,000 men, was received
with contemptuous laughter and jeers in the Volksraad. This
year the Union, apart from smaller matters, endeavoured to do
three things.


Three Efforts : (1) The Raad Elections.
First we were told that a progressive spirit -was abroad, that
twelve oat of twenty-four members of the Yolksraad had to be
elected. It was, therefore, resolved that we should do everything
in our power to assist in the election of the best men who were
put up by the constituencies; and everything that the law per-
mitted us to do in this direction -was done.
The result has been only too disappointing, as the records of
the debates and the division lists in the Yolksraad prove. We
were, moreover, told that public speeches in Johannesburg pre-
vented the progressive members from getting a majority of the
Raad to listen to our requests, that angry passions were inflamed,
and that if we would only hold our tongues reform would be brought
about. We therefore resolved in all loyalty to abstain from
inflaming angry passions, although we never admitted we had,
by act or speech, given reason for legislators to refuse justice to
all. Hence our silence for a long time.
(2) The Railway Concession.
We used all our influence to get the Yolksraad to take over
the railway concession ; but, alas ! the President declared, with
tears in his voice, that the independence of the country was
wrapped up in this question, and a submissive Raad swept the
petitions from the table.
(3) The Franchise Petition.
Our great effort, however, was the petition for the franchise,
with the moderate terms of which you are all acquainted. This
petition was signed by more than 38,000 persons. What was
the result 1 We were called unfaithful for not naturalising
ourselves, when naturalisation means only that we should give up
our original citizenship and get nothing in return, and become
subject to disabilities. Q Members had the calm assurance to state,
without any ground whatever, that the signatures were forgeries,,


and, worst of all, one member, in an inflammatory speech,
-challenged us openly to fight for our rights, and his sentiments
seemed to meet with considerable approval. This is the dis-
appointing result of our honest endeavors to bring about a fusion
between the people of this state and that true union and equality
which alone can be the basis of prosperity and peace. You all
know that, as the law now stands, we are virtually excluded for
ever from getting the franchise, and, by a malignant ingenuity,
our children born here are deprived of the rights of citizenship
unless their fathers take an oath of allegiance, which brings them
nothing but disabilities.
The Bitter Cry of the “ Uitlander.”
We are the vast majority of this State. We own more than
half the land, and, taken in the aggregate, we own at least nine-
tenths of the property in this country; yet, in all matters
affecting our lives, our liberties and our properties, we have abso-
lutely no voice. Dealing now first with the legislature, we find
that taxation is imposed upon us without any representation
whatever; this taxation is wholly inequitable : (a) because a much
greater amount is levied from the people than is required tor the
needs of government; ( h ) because it is either class taxation pure
and simple, or, by the selection of the subjects, though nominally
universal, it is made to fall on our shoulders ; and (c) because the
necessaries of life are unduly burdened.
Abuse op Public Expenditure.
Expenditure is not controlled by any public official independent
of the government. Vast sums are squandered, while the Secret Ser-
vice Fund is a dark mystery to everybody. But, essential as the
power to control taxation and expenditure is to a free people, there
are other matters of the gravest importance, which are equally pre-
cious. The Legislature in this country is the supreme power,
apparently uncontrolled by any fixed Constitution. The chance
will of a majority in the Legislature, elected by one-third of the


people, is capable of dominating us in every relation of life, and'
when we remember that those who hold power belong to a
different race, speak a different language, and have different pur-
suits from ourselves, that they regard us with suspicion, and
even hostility, that, as a rule, they are not educated men, and that
their passions are played upon by unscrupulous adventurers, it
must be admitted that we are in very grave danger.
Tribute to the Moderates.
I think it is but just to pay tribute to the patriotic endeav-
ours of a small band of enlightened men in the Volksraad who*
have earnestly condemned the policy of the government, and
warned them of its danger. To Mr. Jeppe, Mr, Lucas Meyer, the
De Jagers, Mr, Loveday, and a few others in the First Eaad,
leaving out the Second Raad, we owe our best thanks, for they
have fought our battle and Sonfirmed the justice of our cause.
But when we look to the debates of the last few years, what do we
find 1 All through a spirit of hostility ; all through an endeavour
not to meet the just wants of the people; not to remove griev-
ances ; not to establish the claim to our loyalty by just treatment
and equal laws; but to repress the publication of the truth,
however much it might be required in the public interest; to pre-
vent us from holding public meetings ; to interfere with the courts,
and to keep us in awe by force.
The Powers of the Executive.
There is now threatened a danger even graver than those
which have preceded it. The government is seeking to get
through the Legislature an Act which will vest in the executive
the power to decide whether men have been guilty of sedition, and
to deport them and confiscate their goods. The Volksraad has,
by resolution, affirmed the principle, and has instructed the
government to bring up a Bill accordingly next session. To-day
this power rests justly with the courts of law, and I can only say
that if this Bill becomes law, the power of the executive of this


country would be as absolute as that of the Czar of Russia. We
have said good-bye finally to the last principle of liberty.
President Kruger Indicted.
Coming to the Executive government, we find there is no
true responsibility to the people. None of the great departments
of State are controlled by Ministerial officers in the proper sense ;
the President’s will is virtually supreme, and he, with his unique
influence over the legislators of the House, aided by an able, if
hostile, State Secretary, has been the author of every Act directed
against the liberties of the people. It is well that this should be
recognised. It is well that President Kruger should be known for
what he is, and that, once for all, the false pedestal on which he
has so long stood should be destroyed I challenge contradiction
when I state that no important Act has found a place on the
Statute book during the last ten years without the seal of Presi-
dent Kruger’s will upon it; nay, he is the father of every such
Act. Remember that all legislation is initiated by the govern-
ment, and, moreover, President Kruger has expressly supported
every Act by which we and our children have been deprived by
progressive steps of the right to acquire the franchise ; by which
taxation has been imposed on us almost exclusively, and by which
the right and liberty of the press, and the right of public meet-
ing have been attacked.
The Judges and the Liberty of the Subject.
Now we come to the judicial system. The High Court of this
country has, in the absence of representation, been the sole
guardian of our liberties. Although it has, on the whole, done its
work ably, affairs are in a very unsatisfactory position. The
judges have been underpaid, their salaries have never been secure,
the most undignified treatment has been meted out to them, and
the status and independence of the Bench have on more than one
occasion been attacked. A deliberate attempt was made two years
ago by President Kruger and the government to reduce the Bench


to a position subordinate to the Executive government, and only
recently we had in the Witfontein matter the last of the cases in
which the Legislature interfered with vested rights of action.
No Real Trial by Jury.
The administration of justice by minor officials, by native
commissioners and by field cornets, has produced, and is produc-
ing, the gravest unrest in the country ; and lastly, the great
bulwark of liberty, the right to trial by jurymen who are our
peers, is denied to us. Only the burgher or naturalised burgher is
entitled to be a juryman, or, in other words, anyone of us is liable
to be tried upon the gravest charge possible by jurymen who are
in no sense our peers, who belong to a different race, who regard
us with a greater or lesser degree of hostility, and whose passions,
if inflamed, might prompt them, as weak human creatures, to
inflict the gravest injustice, even to deprive men of their lives.
Supposing, in the present tense condition of political feeling, any
one of us was tried before a Boer jury on any charge having
a political flavor about it, should we be tried by our peers, and
should we have a chance of receiving even handed justice ?
The Secret Service Fund.
When we come to the administration we find that there is
the grossest extravagance; that Secret Service moneys are
squandered, that votes are exceeded, that the public credit is
pledged, as it was pledged in the case of the Netherlands Railway
Company, and later still, in the case of the Selati Railway, in a
manner which is wholly inconsistent with the best interests of the
people.
Squandering the Public, Revenue.
The Delagoa Bay festivities are an instance of a reckless dis-
regard of a Parliamentary vote. £20,000 was voted for those
useless festivities—about £60,000 was really expended, and I
believe certain favoured gentlemen hailing from Holland derived


the principal benefit. It is said that £400,000 of our money has
been transferred for some extraordinary purpose to Holland.
Recently £17,000 is said to have been sent out of the country
with Dr. Leyds for secret service purposes, and the public audit
seems a farce. When the progressive members endeavoured to
get an explanation about large sums of money, they were silenced
by a vote of the majority prompted by President Kruger. The
administration of the public service is in a scandalous condition.
A Corrupt Legislature.
Bribery and corruption are rampant. We have had mem-
bers of the Raad accepting presents of imported carriages and
watches wholesale from men who were applying for conces-
sions, and we have the singular fact that in every instance
the recipient of the gift voted for the concession. We have
the President openly stating that the acceptance of pre-
sents was wholly moral. We have a condition of affairs in
which the time of meeting of the Volksraad is looked upon
as the time of greatest danger to our interests, and it is an
open secret that a class of man has sprung up who is in constant
attendance upon the members of the Volksraad, and whose special
business appears to be the “ influencing ” of members one way or
the other. It is openly stated that enormous sums of money have
been spent, some to produce illegitimate results, some to guard
against fresh attacks on vested rights. The Legislature passed
an act solemnly denouncing corruption in the public service. One
man, not an official, was punished under the law, but nothing has
ever been done since to eradicate the evil.
A Tainted Civil Service.
I think thousands of you are satisfied of the venalty of many
of our public servants. 1 wish to guard against the assumption
that all our public servants are corrupt. Thank God, there are
many who are able and honourable men, and it must be gall and
■■wormwood to these men to find the whole tone of the service de-
89


stroyed, and to have themselves made liable to be included under
one general denunciation. But there can be no health in an.
administration, and the public morals must be sapped also, when
such things as the Smit case and the recent Stiemans case go un-
noticed and unpunished.
Two Glaring Cases.
I think it right to state openly what those cases are. N. J-
Smit is a son of a member of the government. He absented
himself for months without leave. He was in the meantime
charged in the newspapers with embezzlement. He returned,
was fined £25 for being absent without leave, and was reinstated,
in office. He is now the Mining Commissioner of Klerksdorp.
He has been charged in at least two newspapers, one of them a
Dutch newspaper published within a stone’s throw of the
government offices, with being an “unpunished thief,” and yet
the government has taken no notice of it, nor has he thought fit
to bring an action to clear himself. In the Stiemans case two
officials in the mining department admitted in the witness-box
that they had agreed to further the application of a relative for
the grant of a piece of land in Johannesburg, on condition that
they were each to receive one-quarter of the proceeds. A third
official, the Landdrost of Pretoria, admitted that he had received
£3OO for his “ influence ” in furthering the application ; yet no
notice had been taken by the government of their scandalous
conduct, and sad to say, the judges who heard the case did not
think it their duty to comment strongly upon the matter. I have
in ray possession now a notarial deed which proves that the
railway commissioner, the landdrost, and the commandant of
Pretoria are members of a syndicate whose avowed object is, or
was, to wrest from the mining companies certain of their rights.
This shows what is going on, and what is the measure of safety of
title to property. Those who should guard our rights are our worst
enemies. In a law introduced by the present government, the


government, instead of the courts, are the final judges in cases of
disputed elections. No election committees are allowed. This
operates against candidates opposed to the government, because
the government has virtually a vast standing army of committee-
men, officials being allowed openly to take part in swaying
elections, and the government being in a position, by the dis-
tribution of contracts, appointments, purchase of concessions, the
expenditure of secret service money and otherwise, to bring into
existence and maintain a large number of supporters who act as
canvassers in times of elections.
Native Affaies.
The administration of native affairs is a, gross scandal,
and a source of immense loss and danger to the community.
Native Commissioners have been permitted to practice extortion,
injustice and cruelty upon the natives under their jurisdiction.
The government has allowed petty tribes to be goaded into rebel-
lion. We have had to pay the cost of the wars, while the
wretched victims of their policy have had their tribes broken up,
sources of native labour have been destroyed, and large numbers
of prisoners have been kept in gaol for something like eighteen
months without being brought to trial. It was stated in the
newspapers that out of sixty-three men imprisoned, thirty-one had
died during that period, while the rest were languishing to death
for the want of vegetable foods. We have had revelations of re-
pulsive cruelty on the part of field-cornets. We all remember the
Rachman case and the April case, in which the judges found field-
cornets guilty of brutal conduct to unfortunate natives; but the
worst feature about these cases is that the government has set the
seal of its approval upon the acts of these officials by paying the
costs of the actions out of the public funds, and the President of
the State a few days ago made the astounding statement in regard
to the April case, that, notwithstanding the judgement of the
High Court, the government thought that Prinsloo was right in


Ms action, and therefore paid the costs. The government is
■enforcing the law which forbids the locating of more than five
families on one farm ; and the field-cornets in various districts
have recently broken up the homes of large numbers of natives
settled on “ Uitlander’s ” lands, just at the time when they had
sown their crops to provide the next winter’s food. The applica-
tion of this law is most unjust, as large numbers of natives are left
on the lands of the Boers. Quite recently a well known citizen
brought into the country, at great expense, some hundreds of
families, provided them with land, helped them to start life,
stipulating only that he should be able to draw from among them
labour at a fair rate of wage to develop his properties. Scarcely
had they been settled when the field-cornet came down and
scattered the people, distributing them among Boer farms. The
sources of the native labour supply have been seriously interfered
with at the borders by government measures, and difficulties have
been placed in the way of transport of natives by railway to the
mines. These things are all a drain upon us as a State, and
many of them are. a burning disgrace to us as a people.
The Education Scandal.
The great public that subscribes the bulk of the revenue is
virtually denied all benefit of State aid in education. There has
been a deliberate attempt to Hollanderise the Republic, and to kill
the English language. Thousands of children are growing up in
this land in ignorance, unfitted to run the race of life, and there
is the possibility that a large number of them will develop into
criminals. We have had to tax ourselves privately to guard
against these dangers, and the iniquity of denying education to the
children of men who are paying taxes is so manifest that 1 pass on
with mingled feelings of anger and disgust.
Railways.
This important branch of the public service is entirely in the
Rands of a corporation domiciled in Holland. This corporation


holds a concession, of course, under which not only is there no-
adequate control over expenditure in construction, but it is en-
titled to charge, and is charging us, outrageous tariffs. How
outrageous these are will be seen from the admission ma i e by Mr.
Middleberg, that the short section of ten miles between Boksburg
and Krugersdorp is paying more than the interest on the cost of
the construction of the whole line of railway from Delagoa Bay.
To add these to its general revenue, of which 10 per cent, is set
aside as a sinking fund, and then to take for itself 15 per cent, of the
balance, the company reports annually to the Raad from Amster-
dam in a language which is practically foreign to it, and makes
up its accounts in guelders, a coinage which our legislators, I
venture to say, know nothing of, and this is independence. We
are liable, as guarantors, for the whole of the debt. Lines have
been built entirely on our credit, and yet we have no say or no
control over these important public works beyond the show of con-
trol which is supposed to be exercised by the present Railway
Commissioner. The company, in conjunction with the executive
government, is in a position to control our destinies to an enor-
mous extent, to influence our relations externally and internally,,
to bring about such friction with the neighbouring States as to
set the whole of South Africa in a tumult. Petitions have been
presented to the Raad, but the President has constantly brushed
these aside with the well-worn argument that the independence of
the State is concerned in the matter. It is involved in the
matter, as all who remember the recent Drifts’ question will
admit. I have been told that it is dangerous for the country to
take over the railways, because it would afford such an immense
field for corruption. Surely this is the strongest condemnation
of the government by its friends, for if it is not fit to run a rail-
way, how can it be fit to manage a whole State ? The powers
controlling this railway are flooding the public service with
Hollanders, to the exclusion of our own people, and I may here
say that in the most important departments of the State we are


being controlled by gentlemen from the Low Country. While the
innocent Boer hugs to himself the delusion that he is preserving
his independence, they control us politically through Dr. Leyds,
financially through the Netherlands Railway, educationally
through Dr. Mausvelt, and in the Department of Justice through
Dr. Coster.
Customs and Trade.
The policy of the government in regard to taxation may be
practically described as protection without production. The most
monstrous hardships result to consumers, and merchants can
scarcely say from day to day where they are. Twice now has
the government entered into competition with traders who have
paid their licenses, and who keep staffs. Recently grain became
scarce. The government was petitioned to suspend the duties,
which are cruelly high, in order to assist the mining industry to
feed its labourers. The government refused this request, on the
plea that it was not in a position to suspend these duties without
the permission of the Volksraad, and yet, in a few days, we find
that the government has granted a concession to one of its friends
to import grain free of duty, and to sell it in competition with the
merchants who have had to pay duties. Ido not attempt to deal
with- this important question adequately, but give this example to
show how the government regards the rights of traders.
Monopolies.
It has been the steady policy of the government to grant
concessions. No sooner does any commodity become absolutely
essential to the community than some harpy endeavors to get a
concession for its supply. There is scarcely a commodity or a
right which has not been made the subject of an application for
the grant of a concession. We all remember the bread-and-jam
concession, the water concession, the electric lighting concession,
and many others ; but I need only point to the dynamite con-
cession to show how these monopolies tend to paralyse our


industries. There may be some of you who have not yet heard,
and some who have forgotten, the facts connected with that out-
rage upon public rights.
Story of the Dynamite Concession.
Some years ago Mr. Lippert got a concession for the sole
right to manufacture and sell dynamite and all other explosives.
He was to manufacture the dynamite in this country. For years
he imported dynamite, under the name of Guhr Impregne, duty
free. He never manufactured dynamite in the country, and upon
public exposure the government was compelled to cancel the con-
cession, the President himself denouncing the action of the
concessionaire as fraudulent. For a time we breathed freely,
thinking we were rid of this incubus, but within a few months the
government granted, virtually to the same people, another con-
cession, under which they are now taking from the pockets of the
public £600,000 per annum, and this is a charge which will go on
growing should the mining industry survive the persistent
attempts to strangle it. How a body charged with the public
interests could be parties to this scandalous fleecing of the
public passes comprehension. Then the curious feature about
the matter is that the government gets some petty fraction of
this large sum, and the concessionaires have on this plea
obtained enormous advances of public monies from the govern-
ment, without security, to carry on their trade. Shortly, the
concessionaires are entitled to charge 90s. per case for dynamite,
while it could be bought, if there were no concession, for 30s. per
case. It may be stated incidentally that Mr. Wolmarans, a
member of the government, has been for years challenged to deny
that he is enjoying a royalty of 2s. on every case of dynamite
sold, and that he has, up to the present moment, neglected to
take up the challenge. Proper municipal government is denied to
us, and we all know how much this means with regard to health,
comfort, and the value of property. The statute books are dis-


figured with enactments imposing religious disabilities ; and the-
English language, the language spoken by the great bulk of the
people, is denied all official recognition. The natural result of the
existing condition of things is that the true owners of the mines
are those who have invested no capital in them:—the government,
the railway concessionaires, the dynamite concessionaires, and
others. The country is rich, and under proper government could
be developed marvellously, but it cannot stand the drain of the
present exactions. We have lived largely upon foreign capital,
and the total amounts of dividends available for shareholders in
companies is ridiculously small as compared with the aggregate
amount of capital invested in mining ventures. Some day the
inevitable result upon our credit and upon our trade will be forced
upon us.
Hatred of the Saxon.
There is no disguising the fact that the original policy of the
government is based upon intense hostility to the English-speaking
population, and that even against the enfranchised burgher of this
state there is a determination to retain all power in the hands of
those who are enjoying the sweets of office now. Naturally the
grateful crowd of relations and friends and henchman ardently
support the existing regime , but there are unmistakable signs, and
the President fears that the policy which has been hitherto
adopted will not be sufficient to keep in check the growing
population. It seems the set purpose of the government to repress
the growth of the industry, to tax it at every turn, to prevent the
working classes from settling here and making their homes, and
surrounding themselves with their families, and there is no
mistaking the significance of the action of the President when he
opposed the throwing open of the town lands of Pretoria on the
ground that “he might have a second Johannesburg there,” nor
that of his speech upon the motion for the employment of diamond
drills to prospect government lands, which he opposed hotly on
the ground that '“there is too much gold here already,”


The Policy of Force.
We now have openly the policy of force revealed to us.
£> 250,000 is to be spent upon the completing of a fort at Pretoria,
£lOO,OOO is to be spent upon a fort to terrorise the inhabitants of
Johannesburg, large orders are to be sent to Krupp’s for big guns,
Maxims have been ordered, and we are even told that German
officers are coming out to drill the burghers. Are these things
necessary, or are they calculated to irritate the feeling to breaking
point ? What necessity is there for forts in peaceful inland
towns ? Why should the government endeavour to keep us in
subjection to unjust laws by the power of the sword, instead of
making themselves live in the heart of the people by a broad policy
of justice ? What can be said of a policy which deliberately
divides the two great sections of the people from each other,
instead of uniting them under equal laws, or the policy which
keeps us in eternal turmoil with the neighbouring States ? What
shall be said of the State-craft, every act of which sows torments,
discontent, or race hatred, and reveals a conception of Republican-
ism under wdiich the only privilege of the majority of the people is
to provide the revenue, and to bear insult, while only those are
considered Republicans who speak a certain language, and in
greater or less degree share the prejudices of the ruling classes.
Conclusion.
I think this policy can never succeed, unless men are abso-
lutely bereft of every quality which made their forefathers free
men, unless we have fallen so low that we are prepared to forget
honour, self-respect, and our duty to our children. Once more, I
wish to state again, in unmistakable language, what has been so
frequently stated in perfect sincerity before, that we desire an in-
dependent Republic, which shall be a true Republic, in which
every man who is prepared to take the oath of allegiance to the
State shall have equal rights, in which our children shall be
brought up side by side, as united members of a strong common-


wealth, that we are animated by no race hatred, that we desire
to deprive no man, behis nationality what it may, of any right.
The Chaster of the Union.
We have now only two questions to consider : (a) What do
we want ? (b) How shall we get it ? I have stated plainly what
our grievances are, and I shall answer with equal directness the
question, “What do we want?” We want: (1) The establish-
ment of this Republic as a true republic ; (2) a Grondwet, or
Constitution, which shall be framed by competent persons selected
by representatives of the whole people, and framed on lines laid
down by them —a Constitution which shall be safeguarded against
hasty alteration ; (3) an equitable franchise law, and fair repre-
sentation ; (4) equality of the Dutch and English languages; (5)
responsibility of the heads of the great departments to the legisla-
ture ; (6) removal of religious disabilities ; (7) independence of the
courts of justice, with adequate and secured remuneration of the
judges ; (8) liberal and comprehensive education ; (9) efficient civil
service, with adequate provision for pay and pension; (10) free
trade in South African products.
CHARLES LEONARD,
Chairman of the Transvaal National Union.
The state of public feeling in Johannesburg from 1890 to
1895 gradually got more and more excited. Once, in 1891,
on his way to confer with the High Commissioner on various
questions, President Kruger passed through Johannesburg and was
besieged in the landdrost’s house by a mob, which uproariously
demanded a speech, groaned, broke in the railings, and actually
hauled down the Transvaal flag and trampled it under foot to the
strains of “ Rule Britannia.” There was a similar scene in 1894,
when an attempt was made to “ commandeer ” the men who were
denied with contempt every other right of citizenship, but were
requisitioned to go to the front and fight for the Republic in one


of its native wars. This is the way that Lord Loch, then Sir
Henry Loch, tells the story :
“ On my arrival at Pretoria I was met at the station by President Kruger,
accompanied by many of his Executive. There was a great crowd at the
station, and it was with the greatest difficulty that President Kruger was
enabled to have a way cleared for himself and myself going to his carriage.
The crowd was a very excited crowd. They removed the President’s coach-
man from the box and took out his horses. Two men clambered on the box
with Union Jacks, and in this way we were conducted to Pretoria, a distance
of from a quarter to half a mile. On our arrival at the hotel, where rooms
had been prepared for me, there was a great crowd assembled in the streets
wishing to present addresses. I reminded those who were anxious to preaenb
addresses to me that I was the guest of a friendly power, and I refused to
receive any address unless proper coasideration was paid to the President, to
his government, and to the people of the South African Republic. There
was much excitement in Johannesburg at this period.”
(This excitement got greater and greater, and in 1895 was
much added to by the incident of the “ drifts.” To understand
this it is necessary to take a brief glance of the railway policy of
the Transvaal Republic. The Transvaal Boer does not belong to
the railway epoch. Left to himself he would not have had a yard
of railway in his country to-day, but the Uitlander came in and
developed the mines and created a community which could not be
fed or served by ox-waggon. But for some time the government
compelled it to make shift with ox-waggon as best it could.
Gradually, however, the iron road had crept north until it reached
the borders of the Orange Free State, and was then carried on
through the Free State territory until it reached the Yaal, only
fifty miles from the mines. There the enterprising railway
management of the Cape Colony found itself blocked by President
Kruger’s declared intention to allow no further progress until,
in course of years, a line from Delagoa Bay through Portuguese
territory could be completed.
Drought, which struck at the transport by oxen, threatened
.famine in Johannesburg literally as well as industrially, and at a


moment when revolution, or at any rate riot, seemed imminent,
the hand of the government was forced by the agitations from
outside and inside. The line was completed to the goldfields, and
railway communication ran all the way from Capetown to
Johannesburg. Later on lines from Natal and Delagoa Bay were
built. An active effort was then made to divert as much traffic as
possible from Cape Colony, and the only method of doing this was
to charge rates which were almost prohibitive on the short span
between the Vaal and the goldfields.
Experience, economy in working, the slowness of trade in
transferring itself, and the urgent need for quick delivery, enabled
the Cape to lower its rates and keep the traffic, while still
retaining a margin of profit; but to such a pitch were the
Transvaal rates raised, that it actually paid to unload goods at the
Vaal River, and to send them the rest of the way by the old,
traditional ox-waggon. Nowhere else on the surface of the earth
could be witnessed an actual competiton between the ox and the
steam locomotive. It was then actually determined to close the
two “ drifts,’' or fords, by which the waggons crossed the Vaal
against the importation of goods from the farther bank. In
August, 1895, a proclamation announcing this appeared, a
proclamation which caused a profound sensation throughout
South Africa. If carried out it meant a block of goods on the
other lines leading to Johannesburg, and something like a
paralysis of trade was threatened.
As the day for closing the drifts drew near, agitation grew
more and more intense, the Rand Chamber of Commerce used
strong language, and the Cape Colony and the Orange Free State
(which was likely to lose largely by its loss of railway revenue),
echoed it. The drifts were closed and the block was piled up
worse than ever. Firms at Johannesburg were in despair. Truck
loads of goods accumulated undistributed. There was only one
hope, and that was in the Imperial government. In giving back
its independence to the Transvaal, one or two guarantees had been


kept against action likely to be prejudicial to the rest of South
Africa. The closing of the drifts was dead against this section of
the Convention, the matter was referred to the Cape Attorney-
General, and on his reporting that the Convention had been
violated, the attention of the High Commissioner was drawn to it.
The question was then remitted to the Law Officers of the Crown
in London, and a similar answer being given, the Republic was
informed that the proclamation violated the Convention, that
the drifts must be opened, and must be allowed to remain open
for all time. President Kruger and his advisers were dumb-
founded at the resolute tone of this communication, and specula-
tion ran high as to what answer they would make to it, but it was
soon announced that they had accepted the situation, and that the
.proclamation would be withdrawn.


The Jameson Raid.
At last it was seen by the leading men of Johannesburg that
the situation of the Uitlanders was becoming so intolerable, that
unless they were to lose all self-respect some effort must be made
to bring pressure on the government. The time had not yet come
when the Imperial government could be successfully appealed to,
and the only other measure was to introduce the element of force,
in other words to rise against the Transvaal government. The
Johannesburg capitalists, who were capitalists first and politicians
afterwards, thought twice and thrice before they could bring them-
selves to this. It was only the hopelessness of reform which ever
brought these rich Johannesburghers to coquette with revolution.
For years it was the reproach of the National Union against them
that they, the natural leaders of the Eand, would not come into
line, preferring to take their chances under the system of autocracy
tempered by corruption, rather than run the risks incidental to
any political upheaval. But one after the other came to see that
some radical steps must be taken, and towards the end of 1895
they began to draw together.
The Premier of Cape Colony was, at that time, Mr. Cecil
John Rhodes, a man whose one dream of a powerful and united
British South Africa, is exemplified in the creation of Rhodesia,
and in the Cape to Cairo railway scheme. To obtain his assent
and assistance was the first requisite, for the Johannesburg
leaders wanted four things before they could hope to bring any
plot to a successful issue, and of these four Mr. Rhodes could
supply three. In Johannesburg they wanted arms, and they
wanted enthusiasm; outside they wanted some color, at least, of
armed support should it come to a fight, and they wanted some
influence which w r ould gain over, or at least neutralise, Afrikander


sympathies in Cape Colony. Mr. Rhodes could supply the arms,
could supply the support from outside, and could look after the
Afrikanders in Cape Colony; the enthusiasm in Johannesburg was
not far to seek, and some months before the end of 1895 Mr.
Rhodes pledged himself to help.
The plot, concisely stated, was that Johannesburg was to
formulate an ultimatum. On its being treated with contempt the
revolutionary party was to take possession of Johannesburg one
night, declare itself the provisional government of the country,
and the same night pay a surprise visit to Pretoria, seize the state
arsenal and the seat of government, and issue an appeal to South
Africa and the world proposing to submit its acts and grievances,
and the future of the Transvaal, to a plebiscite of the entire white
population of the country. It was calculated that with proper
organisation the coup could be accomplished almost without firing
a shot, and the great point would then be to prevent the burghers
rushing to arms all over the country. For this the great surprise,
and the moderation of the demands to be made, were largely
relied on.
Any help from the Imperial Government, or even from the
Cape Colony government, was out of the question, but the British
South Africa Company, which, under a charter, occupied a large
portion of land to the north and west of the Transvaal, offered an
excellent means of procuring outside assistance. The moment
uproar began, and life and property were in danger, a plausible
excuse would be created for the interposition of any organised
British force which was within two days of striking distance. The
pretext for its action would be the jeopardy of British lives,
property and interests, and the necessity for the preservation of
order.
DR. JAMESON.
At this time one of the most prominent officials of the South
African Company was Dr. James Jameson. Dr. Jameson, like Mr.


Rhodes, and many other prominent South Africans, originally went
to South Africa for his health. He had been a brilliant London
medical student, and obtained special repute in South Africa as a
surgeon. Settled at Kimberley, he was one of the most intimate
personal friends of Cecil Rhodes, and the confident of his large
Imperial schemes when the outside world only knew Mr. Rhodes
as a young man speculating in diamonds. Jameson, like many
doctors who have gone to South Africa, determined to play the
part of a man of action, and to play it in his friend’s schemes.
The chance came when the regions beyond the Transvaal were
occupied in the name of British South Africa, and Jameson turned
out to be a man with an extraordinary gift for dealing with men
and attracting their enthusiastic loyalty. This gift is as useful to
an administrator as to a doctor. He took a prominent part in the
war which it was found necessary to fight with the Matabeles;
and it was Jameson who met and stopped a “ trek ” of Boers who
wished to dispute the company’s title. He met them with a few
police troopers just as they were about to cross the Limpopo, and
as they knew that he would not hesitate to use force they turned
back peacefully. Such was the man who was selected to play one
of the leading parts in the contemplated drama ; in some respects
perhaps a better could not have been found, but in others, perhaps,
a worse could hardly have been selected.
As the Uitlander demands grew louder and louder at the time
of the “ drifts ” incident, the government made it clear that it was
providing itself with the last argument of kings and republics.
For weeks it brought offensive arms to bear on Johannesburg.
The Uitlander saw contracts entered into for building, with his
money, forts on the latest pattern of scientific destructiveness,
which could be aimed only at himself. A Mr. Van Zwieten, one
of the imported Hollander officials, was sent to Europe with
credentials to the military authorities of Germany, and with in-
structions to engage a number of military experts. Orders for
heavy artillery and quick-firing guns were placed with Krupps,


and a battery of quick firers was established directly overlooking
the streets of Johannesburg.
ARMING JOHANNESBURG.
It was, therefore, seen that if any steps were to be taken, no
time was to be lost, and accordingly an energetic effort was made
to arm Johannesburg. Colonel Rhodes, a brother of the Cape
Premier, was sent up to the Rand to assist in the organisation at
that end. Another brother, Captain Ernest Rhodes, was just
leaving after a term of directorship of various mines, and the
colonel took his place, and soon set to work to get in rifles. The
British South African Company had been in the habit of import-
ing arms freely ever since the Matabele war. There was, there-
fore, nothing peculiar in cases of arms addressed to them being
cleared at Capetown and forwarded to Mafeking or Kimberley.
The latter was, therefore, chosen as the centre from which to
supply Johannesburg. During November, 1895, accordingly, large
numbers of packages were forwarded to the diamond town, and
stored in the offices of the De Beer’s mine. The trouble was
only when it came to getting them into the Transvaal. The
leaders at Johannesburg put off the solution of this problem till
rather late, but at last it was undertaken by one of them, Mr.
George Farrar, who smuggled them in as mining material in
bulk.
Some of them were sent direct from Kimberley to J ohannes-
burg by rail, under the pretext of the De Beer’s mine supplying
the Simmer and Jack mine, one of the largest in Johannesburg,
with coke suddenly required. Five sheep-trucks were thus got
through, in which 800 rifles were thinly heaped over with coke.
Other consignments were sent in oil-drums, each with a nice little
tap oozing oil. The drums were sent from Kimberley to Port
Elizabeth, and thence by a forwarding agent—as if they had come
oversea—up to Johannesburg, They contained 3 Maxims, 125
oases of ammunition, and 1800 rifles.


The oil-tank forwarding went on from November 6th, andDr-
Jameson had the satisfaction of seeing some of the trucks, when
he was visiting Johannesburg during that month, standing inno-
cently on the Simmer and Jack siding. They were left unloaded
until the last minute, because of the risk of discovery in disposing
of the arms. Discovery of any single batch imported would have
apprised the government of the whole revolutionary design, The
coke-trucks actually only arrived at Johannesburg on the 26th of
December, three days before Dr. Jameson crossed the border.
The balance of the guns, the Maxims, and the bulk of the ammu-
nition only arrived two days after his crossing. A few arms came
too late altogether, and were seized by the government.
FORMING THE COLUMN.
In the meantime preparations went forward for gathering
together the external force which w r as to assist at the critical
moment. This it was decided to assemble mainly at Pitsani, on
the western boundary of the Transvaal, and in British Bechuana-
land. The Mashonaland Mounted Police, in all 250 men, in the
employ of the Chartered Company, were drafted from Bulawayo to
Pitsani, bringing with them 293 horses, 168 mules, 6 Maxims and
2 field guns. The ostensible reason for gathering this force at
Pitsani was that it was necessary to protect the railway works
then in progress near that spot. On the 15th November the
Imperial government handed over to the company the Bechuana-
land Border Police, in accordance with an arrangement long
previously made. This was a most opportune reinforcement, for
the force numbered some hundreds, and was composed of excellent
material. It was indispensable that these troopers should be got
to re-enlist with the company, so Major White offered them good
terms, without, of course, divulging the nature of the service
which was likely to be demanded of them, and the majority at
once accepted engagements.
From the middle of November Mafeking was lively with the
passing through of recruits, all en route to the Pitsani camp, where-


they were busily drilled by Major White and other officers, in
skirmishing, etc. On the 18th of November, Jameson inspected
the camp, talked over matters, and hurried down to Capetown.
From there he telegraphed that he was sending up equipments
and all that was needed, and estimated that 600 men and 700
horses would be available. But, in addition to the equipments,
he also enlisted a certain number of picked men from the Colonial
volunteers at Capetown.
From Capetown he hurried up to Johannesburg, to settle the
details of the plot with the leaders there, and arrange a signal. It
was agreed that Jameson should move in response to a written
appeal, prepared beforehand, as soon as the appeal was confirmed
by telegraph. Accordingly, a letter of invitation was prepared,
and the signatures to this letter give us the names of the leaders
in Johannesburg. It was as follows :
THE LETTER OP INVITATION.
Johannesburg,
December, 1895,
Dr. Jameson,
Dear Sir, —The position of matters in this State has become so critical
that we are assured that at no distant period there will be conflict between
the government and the Uitlander population. It is scarcely necessary for
us to recapitulate what is now matter of history. Suffice it to say, that
the position of thousands of Englishmen, and others, is rapidly becoming
intolerable. Not satisfied with making the Uitlander population pay,
virtually, the whole of the revenue of the country, while denying them
representation, the policy of the government has been steadily to encroach
upon the liberty of the subject, and to undermine the security for property
to such an extent as to cause a very deep-seated sense of discontent and danger.
A foreign corporation of Hollanders is, to a considerable extent, controlling
our destinies, and, in conjunction with the Boer leaders, endeavouring to cast
them in a mould which is wholly foreign to the genus of the people. Every
public act betrays the most positive hostility, not only to everything English,
but to the neighbouring States as well. In short the internal policy of the
government is such as to have aroused into antagonism to it not only, prac-
tically, the whole body of Uitlanders, but a large number of the Boers ; while


its external policy has exasperated the neighbouring States, causing the possi-
bility of great danger to the peace and independence of this Republic.
Public feeling is in a condition of smouldering discontent. All the petitions
of the people have been refused with a greater or less degree of contempt, and
in the debate on the franchise petition, signed by nearly 40,000 people, one
member challenged the Uitlanders to fight for the rights they asked for, and
not a single member spoke against him.
Not to go into detail, we may say that the government has called into
existence all the elements necessary for armed conflict. The one desire of the
people here is for fair play, the maintenance of their independence, and the
preservation of those rights and liberties without which life is not worth
having. The government denies these things and violates the national sense
of Englishmen at every turn.
What we have to consider is, what will be the condition of things here in
the event of conflict ?
Thousands of unarmed men, women, and children of our race will be at the
mercy of well-armed Boers ; while property of enormous value will be in the
greatest peril. We cannot contemplate the future without the gravest
apprehension, and feel that we are justified in taking any steps to prevent the
shedding of blood, and to ensure the protection of our rights.
It is under these circumstances that we feel constrained to call upon you to
come to our aid should disturbance arise here.
The circumstances are so extreme that we cannot avoid this step, and we
cannot but believe that you, or the men under you, will not fail to come
to the rescue of people who would be so situated. We guarantee any
expense that may be reasonably incurred by you in helping us, and ask you
to believe that nothing but the sternest necessity has prompted this appeal.
We are, yours faithfully,
(Signed) Charles Leonard.

THE COMMISSARIAT.
For a dash across country it would be convenient to be able
to dispense with commissariat, but some relays of food were abso-
lutely necessary. To carry what was required would have been
to over-weight the horses altogether, so on the pretext ,of


establishing a coach service between Mafeking and Johannesburg
a line of stores at intervals of a few hours ride were built and
stocked with food and forage all the way from Mafeking to
Krugersdorp. A certain Dr. Wolff, another old Kimberley doctor,
was told off by Jameson for this work, and figured for the purpose
as “ The Rand Produce and Trading Syndicate.” No part of the
plot at the first blush seems cooler and more barefaced than this
elaborate collection of stores for the baiting of men and horses
along the whole line of invasion. The road, however, was
becoming a frequented one, and the pretext passed. On the same
excuse some hundreds of horses for remounts were purchased from
a coaching firm, and stationed midway on the intended line of
march upon a farm which actually belonged to a member of the
Transvaal Volksraad. In all, Dr. Wolff’s part of the business cost
over £lB,OOO.
As the time for action drew near, when Jameson bad finished
his flying visits to Johannesburg and Capetown, the telegraph wire
became the medium of communication between the various parties
to the plot. Johannesburg, Capetown and Pitsani wired to each
other from day to day under the very nose of the government they
were plotting against in the disguise of company promoting meta-
phors. Revolution became “ flotation,” troops on the border were
“foreign subscribers,” and held “shareholders meetings,” while a
proposed manifesto was a “ directors’ circular.”
A PROPOSED DELAY.
It was soon seen at Johannesburg, however, that some delay
in the actual revolt would have to take place. There were several
reasons for this. In the first place the arming of Johannesburg
was not nearly complete, and would not be complete by the date
originally fixed upon, December the 26th. Notwithstanding the
successful smuggling, not more than two or three thousand rifles
were to hand or in sight, and this was a ridiculously small num-
ber to arm a great city in which twenty or twenty-five thousand-


men were available. The smuggling necessarily had to be in com-
paratively small quantities, for ten or twelve thousand rifles make
a weight and bulk which it would have been impossible to get
through all at once. Then the question of ammunition came in.
A million rounds would only give a hundred rounds a piece to ten
thousand rifles; and a million cartridges weigh over thirty tons.
But in addition to these considerations it was necessary to work
the public feeling up to the exploding point, and the capitalists of
Johannesburg had been so long refusing to take any steps in the
direction of agitation, that when they at last threw themselves
into the movement heart and soul, they found a certain luke-
warmness in the general public.
Accordingly messages were sent to the camp at Pitsani
putting the matter off for a short time, one of them running ;
“ Tell Zahlbar (Jameson) the polo tournament here is postponed for one
week, or it would clash with the race week.”
This by no means suited Jameson, who urged that every day’s
delay rendered the risk of discovery greater and greater, and that as
it was suspicions were being aroused in various quarters. It was
impossible to keep absolutely secret the fact that a large force of six
or seven hundred men was in camp at Pitsani, that these men
were being equipped on a fairly extensive scale, and that they were
being assiduously drilled by ex-military officers. Some indiscreet
letters had been sent home to London, and some vague rumours
had reached the Colonial Office there. An inquiring cable message
was therefore sent to the High Commissioner, and a second
message from one of the Capetown men in the venture intimated
that if anything was to be done it would not be wise to delay too
long. Jameson therefore made up his mind that unless he
started soon he would probably never get the chance of starting
at all.
It would be tedious to recapitulate all the telegrams which
passed on the matter, but it was very evident that the heads of the
plot in Johannesburg were not nearly so unanimous as they might


[have been. Various disputed questions arose, and at one time it
looked as though the whole scheme must fall through. Jameson
determined to force the running, and on Sunday morning, the 29th
December, 1895, sent two final telegrams, one to Capetown and
the other to Johannesburg, saying that he would positively start
that night.
ROUSING JOHANNESBURG.
In the meantime how were things going on in Johannesburg!
Every effort had been made to bring the general population, and
-especially the mining element, into line; and the leaders of the
reform movement addressed crowded meetings of the miners and
artisans night after night. The majority displayed a ready
willingness to assist in the agitation and to stand up for it, but
some of the late comers, who had probably not yet felt the pinch
of oppression, were more backward. Moreover there were two
camps. There was the Anglo-Saxon camp, comprising English-
men, Welshmen, Irishmen, Scotchmen, Canadians, Australians,
Americans, and colonists from the Cape and Natal; and there
was the Continental camp, comprising Germans, Frenchmen, and
Scandinavians, with a sprinkling of the Latin races. The former
were all for the National Union and its work ; the latter would
not hear a word about exercising force, and urged that the only
way of obtaining concessions was to submit uncomplainingly to
the government at Pretoria.
Christmas Day, 1895, was one of intense excitement, and this
at once became acute when on the next day, the 26th of December,
the National Union issued the manifesto published in an earlier
-chapter. It was at once seen that the gauntlet had been thrown
down, and the Boxing Day races, a great event in Johannesburg,
simply served as a meeting-place for people to discuss the situa-
tion. Before the manifesto was twenty-four hours’ old, it became
patent that the government had awakened to the seriousness of
the aspect of affairs. Means had been taken to let President
Eruger know that Johannesburg was well armed, and that a crisis


of a grave character was nigh at hand; while it was whispered;
that there was a division in the council at Pretoria. But all
hopes were shattered when a message came back that no conces-
sions would be made, and that all must “ Obey the law.’ 7
This at once precipitated matters in Johannesburg, and
closed up the ranks of some who had begun to waver. A step was
taken which was decisive—a citizen army was raised. The credit
for the formation of the first force available for this or any other
purpose belongs to the Australians. Led by Mr. Walter D.
Davies, they assembled, ostensibly for the purpose of forming a
Red Cross Brigade, and soon a large number of men had been en-
rolled. The Americans met too, and soon other nationalities
followed.
The effect of this tumult and excitement was shown in an
exodus of people anxious to get away from the coming trouble.
On the 28th, by three o’clock in the afternoon, eitrlit hours before
the departure of the train for Cape Colony, they began to get into
the carriages as they stood in the station-yard, and when the train
drew up at Braamfontein station, where the trains are made up, a
mile or so from the central station of departure, a crowd of over a
thousand persons seized it, and scrambled into such compartments
as had not already been taken. But the most maddening scene of
all was that which took place at the central station. Four or five
thousand people greeted the approach of the train, and then there
was such a fight for seats as never before was witnessed. Those
who had booked first-class, and had anticipated a clean and com-
fortable bed for the night, found themselves glad enough to sit in.
second-class compartments, four or five in a row; while wealthy
men disguised themselves, and hid under the seats, and behind'
the petticoats of their womankind, from the jeers of the men who
stood on the platform. The women and children were cheered
and wished God-speed on their journey, and at midnight the train
of carriages, twenty-two in number, steamed away towards the-
border—and safety.


A FIRM FRONT.
By Monday, the 30th of December, Johannesburg was pre-
senting an almost united front. Many of the waverers had left, and
the others had been won over, only the Germans and Frenchmen
hung back. Early on that morning the rumours of the past few
days, concerning the possession of firearms, became a demonstrated
fact. Rifles had been served out at certain mines the day before,
and men began to appear in kharki suits and bandoliers. It was
given out that there was no lack of weapons, and that there were
a thousand rifles and a Maxim at the Simmer and Jack mine
alone. On the wdiole the impression prevailed that the Reform
Committee was fully prepared for every emergency.
The effect of all this on the trade of the town may well be
imagined. There was an immediate and general advance of a
hundred per cent, in the price of all food, and bread went from
sixpence to a shilling per lib. loaf. All credit was suspended,
and orders for supplies coming forward from the ports were
countermanded. The exodus continued, and train load after
train-load left, the men on them being presented with white
feathers by the crowd on the platform. Moreover, the population
from the outskirts flocked into Johannesburg, waggon-loads of
women and children and household furniture arriving every hour.
Shelter for the fugitives was quickly found, the large clubs and
other institutions turning their offices into bed and dining rooms.
Recruiting for town protection and for district duty went on all
day long, and good care was taken that Pretoria, which was re-
ported to be getting really frightened, should be informed of the
fact.
All was going merrily, when at five o’clock in the afternoon
news was received that Jameson had started, he having set out
the previous night. A rumour was first heard from Pretoria, and
this was later on confirmed by a message from Capetown. It ran
thus-


The veterinary surgeon has left for Johannesburg with some good horse-
flesh, and backs himself for seven hundred.
In these terms was conveyed the news that seven hundred
armed men had actually invaded the territory of the Republic. A
“ Reform Committee,” practically a Committee of Public Safety,
was immediately formed; and soon numbered sixty-four of the
leading men in Johannesburg. All Monday night leading Re-
formers were engaged in unpacking grease-covered rifles till their
arms ached, but to those behind the scenes it was painfully evi-
dent that the number of arms available was quite inadequate.
The Scottish Brigade, eleven hundred strong, was formed on that
eventful Monday, but none of them ever shouldered a gun—the
guns were not there to give them. This fact was kept a strict
secret, for a policy of “ bluff” was the only one left. Accordingly
a great parade was made, and waggon loads of rifles and tons of
ammunition were brought in from the mines where they had been
stored ; while three Maxims were brought in and located at the
Rand Club ibr general inspection. And so Monday passed and
Tuesday dawned.
JAMESON STARTS.
On Sunday evening the Resident Magistrate at Mafeking
had been surprised at supper by a noise like cheering from the
direction of the police barracks. Tne men were paraded in full kit
marching order, and soon afterwards, 160 strong, with four guns,
they trotted down the high road leading to the Transvaal. At
Pitsani there were about 380 men, and about the same time these
were paraded and the troopers asked to go to the relief of
Johannesburg. There were a few hangers back, but most of the
men, who were nearly all young, some of them mere lads, at once
gave in their adhesion.
And so they started, trotting in the moonlight over the level
veldt, and across the invisible line which separated the territory
of the Chartered Company from that of the Transvaal Republic.


An essential part of the plan was the cutting of the telegraph
wires. Elaborate arrangements were made for this. Men were
told off to go to certain spots, to cut certain lengths of wire, to
take the lengths a certain distance into the veldt, and there to
bury them. This was successfully carried out with the telegraph
lines going south to Gape Colony, but unfortunately in the case of
the really important wire, that going to Pretoria, a hitch occurred.
Instead of getting hold of the true line, the man told off for the
purpose carefully cut a section of sheep wire and interred it a
foot or two in the earth. It was afterwards said that the trooper
in question was drunk at the time, but whether he was drunk or
only foolish, the results were disastrous.
The two columns effected their junction at the village of
Malmani, 39 miles from Pitsani, less from Mafeking. It was
5 o’clock on Monday morning, and great was the surprise of the
few folks who were stirring. The united force numbered 512 men,
all mounted, with about 80 pack horses, and a few Kaffirs to lead
them, with 11 carts drawn by horses or mules, and loaded with
ammunition and a small amount of provisions, with eight Maxims,
one 12-pounder, and two 7-pounders. In command were Dr.
Jameson, Sir John Willoughby (of the Royal Horse Guards),
Major Robert White, Lieut.-Colonel Henry F. White, Colonel
Raleigh Grey, and several other ex-members of the British Army.
An invalid officer who happened to be staying at Mafeking for his
health, went along in his own cart “to see the fun.” The route
to be followed had been carefully mapped out beforehand by Major
White, and from Malmani followed a road which went straight
across the veldt to Krugersdorp. The road was, of course, a mere
cart track, but there is a refreshment house of some kind or the
other about every two hours on horseback.
The column went along with scouts, advance guard and
flanking columns, the artillery and carts in the centre. Elaborate
instructions were drawn up for the march, and the officers com*


manding the different guards and parties were supplied with these.
They were not always strictly carried out, but on the whole the
military discipline was good. The halts made, however, were
very short, hardly long enough, indeed, for the men to eat the
food provided for them. Two hours was about the longest stay
made anywhere, except once, when the road was lost for a little
while. So the column jogged on, walking, cantering and trotting
by turns. An especial push was made to pass a defile, marked by
Major White as “ dangerous,” and this was achieved a little after
5 p.m. Soon afterwards the first official protest was received
from a Transvaal district commander. To this a polite but
evasive answer was returned.
On Tuesday morning the column reached the farm where the
remounts were supposed to be in readiness. But they turned out
to be a most inferior lot, and either because they could not be
caught, or because they were regarded as useless, little advantage
was taken of them, and the column rode on, mostly with the same
horses. That morning it was caught up by a mounted trooper,
one of those who had declined to join, who brought the first word
from the High Commissioner of South Africa, Sir Hercules
Robinson, in Capetown. He had ridden the eighty miles at top
speed, and would have caught them some hours sooner if he had
not been stopped by a patrol of Boers. His despatch was opened
by the commandant, who let him go on, on seeing what it was.
The despatch, or despatches, for there was a separate one for each
officer, ordered the column to return immediately, saying that the
violation of the territory of a friendly State was repudiated by Her
Majesty’s government, and that all engaged in it were rendering
themselves liable to heavy penalties. There was no eagerness to
read these messages, and the man who brought them was sent
with the package from one officer to another without being able
to deliver them. At last the whole were taken by Jameson, and the
trooper was told that they would be attended to. The column
then moved off—in the direction of Johannesburg.


THE FIGHTING.
h It was midnight on Tuesday, New Year’s Eve, before the
first sign of hostility was encountered. A few Boers had been
hanging on to the column for the previous twenty-four hours,
retiring as it advanced. As it reached a place where the road
mounts some rising ground, a few of these shot into it from over
the brow. It was a brief and dropping fire, and only one man
>vas wounded. Early on Wednesday morning a messenger with a
safe conduct brought a most preremptory mandate from the British
agent at Pretoria. This intimated that the invasion was entirely
disapproved and repudiated, those engaged in it were ordered to
retire from the country, and told that they would be held personally
responsible for the consequences of their conduct.
At the same time the first word was heard from Johannes-
burg, notes from Colonel Rhodes and Mr. Lionel Phillips being
brought by a couple of cyclists about midday on Wednesday,
when the column came in sight of Krugersdorp, the western ter-
minus of a railway line which runs along the “reef” through
Johannesburg, Johannesburg itself being from fifteen to twenty
miles away. As the now nearly exhausted riders came in sight
of Krugersdorp, they saw the headgear and heaps of tailings of
quite a number of mines,
But now the Boers were gathering to impede their further
progress. Hasty word had been sent out to district after district,
and, seizing his rifle, slinging his ammunition over his shoulder,
and taking a bag of food, the farmer had jumped on his hardy
little pony and ridden off to the rendezvous. This was at Krugers-
dorp, and hour by hour they gathered by the hundred, until they
numbered over seven thousand. The cyclists had warned the
column that there were a few Boers at Krugersdorp, and the ap-
proach was made warily. The Boers, who were found to number
over eight hundred, instead of three hundred, as reported by the


cyclists, fell back ; and just outside the town the final store of
food was reached. But the arrangements were bad, and neither
men nor horses got much to eat.
A little way from here was a disused battery-house, and this,
surrounded by heaps of tailings, made a natural fort. It was
occupied in force by the Boers, while a ridge at the back was*
manned with a long line of sharpshooters. As the column ad-
vanced, a message was sent to the Boer commander, saying that
the force wished to advance peaceably, but that if they were not
permitted to do so by four o’clock, they would have to attack. No
answer was received to this, and soon after the hour named the
guns were brought to bear, and presently a hole was neatly
knocked in the roof of the battery-house. It was hastily aban-
doned by the Boers, none of whom were hurt, however. The fire
was then turned on the ridge at the back, and after a few rounds
of shrapnel had been fired at it, a charge was ordered. But the
Boers on the ridge had not been much damaged by the shrapnel,
as they laid down just behind it, and the shots went over them.
Accordingly, as they saw a line of horsemen, about a hundred
them, they took steady aim, and when the
line had come to within a range of about 200 yards, fired. The
result was that about a score of saddles were emptied. The charge
w r as checked, and the survivors turned round and galloped back.
The officers now took council together, and soon after five o’clock
the column, in two parts, made a move to the south. As it grew
dusk some undecided movements were made, which caused some
delay, the reason being that firing was heard in the direction of
Krugersdorp. It was supposed that some reinforcements had
arrived from Johannesburg, but as a matter of fact the firing was
a salute of welcome by the Boers to some friends. This loss of
time was of the utmost importance, for it gave the Boers time to
mass round the column. Seeing the enemy in front and on two
sides, the force, after proceeding about two miles, camped for the
night.


A weary night it proved for the tired men, for guided by a
light in an ambulance waggon, where the doctors were attending
to about thirty wounded troopers, the Boers fired steadily into the
camp, killing two and wounding several more. At four in the
morning, a trooper was sent off to Johannesburg, eighteen miles
distant, asking for help ; and it is on record that some thirty
others got through the straggling Boer lines and made their way
to the city. As the light came, a move was made across the
embankment of the railway, and about seven o’clock, as the
column was moving alon g among the mining properties, a further com-
munication was received from the British agent at Pretoria. This
conveyed the cheering assurance that all British subjects in the
Transvaal were enjoined to “ abstain from giving the said Dr.
Jameson any countenance or assistance.”
The long running fight now zigzagged through depressed
ground as the column took advantage of the shelter afforded by the
hollows. But the Boers were enabled to make long detours
round, and at last a strong body headed it off. Five or six miles
south or south-east of Krugersdorp the last stand was made. An
outbuilding was seized, and a disused cattle kraal, with stone
walls the height of a man, was occupied by one troop. The Boers
gradually crept nearer, and men and horses began to drop rapidly.
Nevertheless a brisk defence was kept up. The Maxims were fired
till they grew too hot, and water failing for the cool jacket, five of
them jammed and went out of action. The 7-pounder was fired
until only half an hour’s ammunition was left, one last rush was
made, and failed, and then the artillery which had been des-
patched from Pretoria came up, and further fighting was im-
possible.
THE SURRENDER.
It was between eight and nine o’clock on Thursday morning,
the 2nd January, 1896, that a white flag was displayed. Several
Boers walked forward, and a letter intimating that the force would
surrender, if guaranteed a safe conduct out of the country, was


handed to them. In half an hour an answer came back that if
the column would lay down its arms, the lives of all in it would
be spared. The terms were accepted, and about five hundred
Boers quickly galloped up from various directions ; the troopers
began to stack their arms, and soon all were given up. The
officers were taken off to the Court-house at Krugersdorp, fed, and
driven to Pretoria, a distance of fifty miles, in carts. The men
were conducted there on horseback, guarded by a strong escort; a
Tew keeping up their spirits by singing “ After the Ball is Over.”
Both officers and men were treated well. They were all after-
wards handed over to the British government to punish.
In all the fighting there were seventy-six casualties among
the troopers, and of these twenty-seven were killed or mortally
wounded. They had been engaged for twenty-one hours, and so
arduous had been the work that when the Boers took possession
of their prisoners, they were astonished to find the breeches of
gome of them sticking to the saddle with blood. Taking every-
thing into consideration it would have been almost impossible for
the column to have got through. The fatal wire to Pretoria left
uncut had given the Boers the alarm in plenty of time, and the
column only got to within eighteen miles of Johannesburg, because
the farmers had been told to meet at that spot. The one thing that
could have saved it would have been a sortie in force from Johan-
nesburg, but this could not be made, for the simple reason that no
armed force was there to make it. Even if Jameson had got
through, it is difficult to see what he could have done for Johan-
nesburg, for a force of two thousand untrained miners, even aided
by Jameson’s troopers, would have been quite inadequate for a
successful revolution.
IN JOHANNESBURG
The news that Jameson had actually invaded the Republic
was received with mixed feelings in Johannesburg. In the Anglo-
Saxon camp the intelligence was received with joy, but among


tile Americans and some others there was a cry that it was an
unwarrantable interference in a matter which did not concern him.
It was, of course, quite impossible for those in the plot to avow
the details of it; and it was naturally assumed that the doctor
had come in uninvited. As he got nearer and nearer, however,
public feeling grew in his favor, and it was confidently believed
that he would enter the city on Thursday ; in fact elaborate pre-
parations were made to welcome him.
The ferment increased hour by hour, but the business-like
manner in which the Reform Committee was seen to be forming
a defence force gave great confidence. A number of horses made
their appearance in some mysterious manner from the mines, and
being handed over to Colonel R. Bettington, quite a respectable
body of mounted men, known as Bettington’s horse, was soon in
evidence. Another development was the formation of a field
ambulance corps, and a hospital corps. At the same time a relief
fund for those who had been left unprovided for by the crisis was
started; and in a few hours nearly £BO,OOO was subscribed. The
local commandant of police agreed with the Reform Committee
that “ to avoid possible collisions,” he should entirely withdraw
his men, and thereafter the duty hitherto performed by them was
carried out by a force appointed by the committee. The work
was admirably carried out, all drink shops being closed with a
firm hand, and one man,-caught red-handed in a store, was flogged
vigorously. A summary court was also appointed, and this also
did excellent service.
During Tuesday afternoon two remarkable messages were
received from Pretoria. The first asked the committee to meet a
deputation of burghers to discuss the situation, and the second
was from President Kruger suggesting a twenty-four hours’
armistice, with the idea of coming to terms. This looked
well, and both requests were immediately granted. The deputa-
tion arrived the same evening, and in accordance with the policy
of “ bluff,” every effort was made to impress the members with the


extent of the military forces at the disposal of the committee. This
sat permanently in the “ Goldfields Company Limited ” building,
and into this the members were passed through an armed guard.
Inside the building were men busily unpacking rifles, while
glimpses of Maxims and piles of ammunition could be seen along
the passages. On the way out again a large drain pipe was seen
in a cart, and this was referred to in a casual sort of way as a large
piece of ordnance.
It was arranged that the deputation should be accompanied
back to Pretoria by some members of the Reform Committee, who
should there interview the President. Accordingly they went, but
instead of the President, they met a commission appointed by the
government. It was announced to them that Sir Hercules Robin-
son had offered his services as mediator, and that the government
had accepted the offer. Pending his arrival, no steps would be
taken against Johannesburg, provided that no hostile steps were
taken against the government. In the meantime, all grievances
would be earnestly considered. The Rand deputation believed
their cause was won, and the terms were eagerly agreed to.
It was now Wednesday afternoon, and no news had been re-
ceived of the near approach of Jameson. The two cyclists had
been despatched to him, but, on attempting to return, they were
stopped by the Boers. It was seven in the evening before the lirst
definite news of the fighting was brought in. Early on Thursday,
when Jameson was fighting for dear life just outside Krugersdorp,
about a hundred and twenty mounted men with rifles were sent
out in the direction where he was expected to show himself,
Colonel Rhodes taking this responsibility on himself. As soon as
the Reform Committee met, however, there was a great outcry at
this action. The armistice, it was said, had been broken.
Accordingly, a messenger was hastily sent after the force, and it
was recalled. Early in the morning, it was universally believed
that Jameson was forcing his way in, but as the day wore on
doubts began to rise, and these were not quelled by the scraps of


news which came over the wire from Pretoria. By two o’clock it
was known that he had surrendered, but the news was confined to
a few, and it was five o’clock before it was actually published to the
crowds in the streets.
At once an indescribable whirlwind of frenzy seized the mob,
and all the order which had been preserved during the previous
few days was at an end. Ten thousand excited persons clamored
round the headquarters of the Reform Committee, and in reply to
their shouts and cries, Mr. Lionel Phillips appeared, and said that
Jameson had surrendered to the High Commissioner’s proclama-
tion. But the bitter truth had to be swallowed, and as the night
came on, it was recognised on all hands that the game was up.
JOHANNESBURG BEATEN.
It was Saturday before Sir Hercules Robinson arrived in Pre-
toria, and there he was informed by the government that Johan-
nesburg must lay down its arms at once and unconditionally, as a
precedent to a discussion of any kind. This ultimatum was con-
veyed to the Reform Committee, which found itself utterly unable
to resist. It had a paper army of twenty thousand men, rifles for
one in every ten, and ammunition for half-an-hour’s fighting.
Unfortunately, it was one thing to order the men who were really
armed to give up their rifles, and quite another thing to get them
to do it. There was only one thing to do—to explain that the
lives of Jameson and his men were in danger, and that the only
way to save them was to submit to the terms offered. This was
announced to the crowd by Sir Sydney Shippard, as agent for the
High Commissioner, from the balcony of the Rand Club ; shortly
afterwards the rifles began to come in. Many of the men smashed
their weapons, while others threw them away, but the greater por-
tion were collected and taken to the Reform Committee offices.
Later on, they, together with the Maxims, were handed over to
representatives of the Transvaal government.


, A strong force of Boers was now drafted into the town, the
.government officials took up their work again, the government
police again patrolled the streets—and the revolution was at an
end. In the meantime the negotiations between the High Com-
missioner and the government were proceeding, but President
Kruger had now got his foot on the neck of Johannesburg, and
would grant nothing. Jameson and his men were handed over to
the British authorities, but further than this he would not budge,
On the 9th and 10th of January warrants were issued for the arrest
of the members of the Reform Committee, and sixty-four of them
were safely lodged in gaol.
AFTER THE RAID.
Shortly after their arrival in England, Jameson and his officers
were quietly smuggled to Bow-street police court, where, on the
25th of February they were charged under certain clauses of the
Foreign Enlistment Act. They were remanded to the 25th of
March, when the preliminary examinations began. These took
some time, a large number of witnesses from South Africa having
to be heard. Finally, Dr. Jameson, Sir John Willoughby, Major
Coventry, and the two Whites were committed for trial; the rank
and file had, of course, been disbanded in South Africa.
The trial itself opened on the 20th of July, before the Chief
Justice, Baron Pollock and Mr. Justice Hawkins, with a special
jury. It lasted seven days, and the case being absolutely clear
against the accused, the jury then found them guilty. The
sentences pronounced by the Chief Justice, were—Jameson,
fifteen months imprisonment; Willoughby, ten months; Major R.
White, seven months; the others, five months each, without hard
labor. The prisoners, in strict accordance with the terms of their
sentences, were at first placed under the ordinary convict regula-
tions, and for a day or two public opinion was shocked at seeing
these men clad in the “ broad arrow ” uniform. By the exercise
of the Queen’s prerogative, however, an order was issued from the
124


Home Office, directing their removal to Holloway gaol, where
were treated as first class misdememeants. Major Coventry’s health
being endangered by confinement, owing to the troublesome nature-
of a wound received at Krugersdorp, he was released in a few
weeks. In December Dr. Jameson was reported to be sinking
under the effects of a painful operation, and he also was released
after a few months confinement. The other sentences were served
in full.
While the raiders were standing their trial in England, the
members of the Deform Committee were being similarly dealt
with in Pretoria. The preliminary hearing began on the 3rd of
February and was not concluded till the Bth of April. The
actual trial opened on the 24th April, a judge being imported from
the Orange Free State to preside. At the last moment the whole
of the prisoners decided to plead guilty, four to high treason, and
the rest to Use majeste. On the 28th of April the four who had
signed the letter of invitation w r ere sentenced to death, the others
being sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and to pay fines of
£2,000 each, or an extra year’s imprisonment. The four sentenced
to death w r ere George Farrar, Lionel Phillips, Colonel Rhodes, and
John Hays Hammond; Charles Leonard, the fifth signer, having
escaped.
The men sentenced in this way were the heads of the
Republic’s one great industry, who employed, directly or indirectly,
about half its population. They were the men whose co-operation
the government had bargained for and made use of at the time of
the armistice. An indescribable wave of feeling swept the packed
court and then the streets, which were crowded with people. The
condemned four kept a good countenance and met their fate like
men. The shock was not confined to Pretoria, it re-echoed
throughout the whole of South Africa, and created great public
excitement throughout the world. Mr. Chamberlain, the Colonial
Secretary, cabled to President Kruger expressing his confidence
that the death sentences would be commuted, and adding that he


ha! assure:! parliament to this effect. The force of public opinion
was too great, and it was announced that this had been done.
But day after day passed without any sign being given by
President Kruger and his advisers, and the Uitlander public grew
angry and impatient. Meantime the reformers were herded
together with every circumstance of discomfort in a corrugated
iron shed, hastily improvised for their accommodation within the
precincts of Pretoria gaol. The district surgeon warned the
government of the hardships suffered by the prisoners, and the
insanitary condition of the prison ; but his representations passed
unheeded, and on the 16th of May one of the prisoners, whose
mind had become unhinged, was discovered to have committed
suicide. His young wife had taken up a position at the prison
gates, and her despair as day after day passed and nothing was
done, and her utter prostration when the fatal news was told her,
■were intensely tragic.
This forced matters to an issue, and a few days later it was
announced that the sentences of the leaders were commuted to
fifteen years’ imprisonment, and that three sick prisoners had
been sent to the hospital. The other sentences were also reduced,
and the prisoners were given to understand that a petition for par-
don would be favorably considered. Still public sentiment was by
no means satisfied, it being evident that it was the intention of the
Transvaal government to dole out mercy inch by inch; whereas the
interests of the whole of South Africa required a speedy amnesty.
A great meeting was held in Capetown urging this view, and other
pressure being brought to bear, the whole of the prisoners, except
the four leaders, and Messrs. Sampson and Davies, were released on
payment of their fines. Messrs. Sampson and Davies, the latter
being the leader of the Australian brigade, refused to plead for
mercy, and were kept in prison until released at the time of the
Queen’s Jubilee. The four leaders were later on released on paying
fines of £25,000 each, so that altogether the Transvaal mad* a
very good thing, financially, out of the abortive revolution.


Drifting Into War.
At the time of the armistice made between President Kruger
and the Reform Committee at Johannesburg, by the medium of
the High Commissioner, a distinct promise was made by the
Transvaal government that the grievances which had brought
about the outbreak should be redressed. No sooner was Johan-
nesburg disarmed, the High Commissioner gone back to Cape-
town, and the Reform Committee safely in prison, however, than
this promise was treated with contempt. The Transvaal Yolks-
raad during a prolonged session proceeded to pass a number of
retrogressive and coercive measures. An almost Russian Press
Law, an Uitlander Expulsion Law, and an Uitlander Immigration
Law were among the mildest of these, and only attracted special
attention because they distinctly violated the London Convention
of 1884. Side by side with these a vast sum was spent in military
preparations. The whole of the burghers were armed, and war-
like stores were imported on a scale which was unprecedented in
South Africa. New forts were also erected at Pretoria and
Johannesburg, and a special effort was made to improve the artil-
lery service. So extensive, in fact, were the preparations that it
was generally rumoured that the Republic intended to throw oft’
the last shred of Imperial dependence, and proclaim itself a
sovereign power. In 1897 the estimates showed an expenditure
of £52,462 on War Office salaries ; £948,510 for war purposes ;
£160,000, charges in connection with the Johannesburg revolt;
tmd £730,000 for public works, the latter being the forts before
mentioned.
With all this there was a considerable section of the com-
munity, largely consisting of the continental element, which
argued that with patience everything would right itself.


President Kruger and his government could not be expected to
grant favors, it was said, while the remnants of the rebellion were
actually being cleared away ; but let this once be done with, and
the angry feelings which it had engendered subside, and ample
concessions would be made.
In March, 1896, Lord Rosraead, otherwise Sir Hercules
Robinson, the Queen’s High Commissioner, left South Africa, and
was succeeded by Sir Alfred Milner. The new appointment gave
universal satisfaction, and Sir Alfred Milner received a very
enthusiastic reception on his arrival in Cape Colony. During the
next few months he made an extensive tour of the whole of the
British possessions in South Africa, going as far north as Bula-
wayo, where he opened the railway line on its completion to that
point. Much was hoped from the presence in South Africa of a
man of such energy of character as Lord Rosmead’s successor, for
it was thought that he would be able to hasten the long delayed
reforms in the Transvaal, and so free the whole community south
of the . Zambesi of a chronic source of disturbance.
These expectations were very far from being fulfilled, and
twelve months of hope delayed succeeded in producing a dreary,
persistent depression on the Rand. A presidential election Aias
due in the Republic, and it was given out that nothing could he
done until after it was over. Three candidates entered the field—
Kruger, Joubert, and a so-called “progressive,” a Mr. Schalk
Burger. About the latter’s political bona fides, there were some
doubts, but in any case the re-election of Kruger was assured.
The whole electoral machinery was in the hands of the govern-
ment, and it was used unscrupulously ; the Boers largely supported
him, and the Uitlanders had no votes. The figures were—Kruger,
12,858 ; Burger, 8,758 ; and Joubert, 2,001.
Notwithstanding all promises, however, President Kruger’s
re-election led to no reforms, and to no change in the policy of the
Pretoria government in regard to the Uitlander population.. The
mining industry was the subject of especial attack, and so syste-


matically was this carried on that many of the mines were shut
down ; it being impossible to work them at a profit in the face of the
•exactions imposed. But one of the greatest grievances complained
of by the residents of Johannesburg was the state of the police
force of the city. The men composing it were called zarps, from
the initials on their caps, Z.A.R.P.—Zud African Republic Police.
They were a body of men some six or seven hundred in number,
largely recruited from the worst elements of the imported Hol-
lander and native Dutch populations. They made it their par-
ticular business to harass the English-speaking people in every
possible manner; and while the commonest crimes went unde-
tected and unpunished, British subjects were oppressed with every
species of tyranny. Luckily, corruption was rampant, and a
little relief could sometimes be purchased by those who had
money.
Towards the end of 1898 an Englishman named Thomas
Jackson Edgar was wantonly shot by a zarp named Stephanus
Jones. Edgar had some words with a man of the name of Forster,
as a result of which the latter received a blow. The zarp was in-
formed of the occurrence, and immediately went to Edgar’s house,
without having any warrant, and proceeded to burst open the
door; on Edgar showing some resentment, he at once shot him
dead. The matter was taken up by the British representative at
Pretoria, and, after some insistance, Jones was arrested. The
•charge brought against him was only one of manslaughter, but
police witnesses stated that Edgar resisted arrest, and the jury (no
Uitlander can serve on a jury) at once found him not guilty. The
judge, in discharging the accused, said that he entirely agreed
with the verdict, and hoped that the police would always know
how to do their duty.
It was now generally felt that this kind of thing could not be
allowed to go on. Not only in Johannesburg was this sentiment
expressed, but in Cape Colony and in Great Britain the feeling
grew that the situation in the Transvaal was a standing menace


to the peace of South Africa. In March, this year, the matter
was brought before the House of Commons in a long and able
speech by Sir Ellis Ashmead Bartlett, who detailed many of the
methods by which the unfortunate Uitlanders were being
oppressed. In Cape Colony public meetings were held in many
centres ; and the press of the whole of South Africa, outside the
organs subsidised by the Boer government, rang with fierce
denunciations of the Pretoria oppressions.
It was therefore determined to approach the High Com-
missioner, and to ask for his active interference. A petition was
prepared and signed by twenty-one thousand men, notwithstanding
that absolute secrecy was imperative, as such action broke one
of the many coercive laws. When it was ready a public meeting
was called, another breach of the law, and in silence, for to speak
would have been to incur further penalties, it was taken to the
British Agent and solemnly presented. As soon as this action
was made public the gentlemen who had called the meeting,
a Mr, Webb and a Mr. Dodd, were arrested and thrown into
gaol; only being temporarily released on finding bail to the
amount of £l,OOO each, five times the amount allowed to the
policeman Jones.
The petition having been forwarded to the Home Govern-
ment, Sir Alfred Milner, on May 4th, sent a long telegraphic
despatch to the Colonial Secretary. This was as follows :
THE DESPATCH.
High Commissioner Sir Alfred Milner to Mr. Chamberlain.
(Received 1 a.m., May 5, 1899.)
Having regard to critical character of South African situation and likeli-
hood of early reply by her Majesty’s government to petition, I am telegraph-
ing remarks which under ordinary circumstances I should have made by"
despatch. ■» Events of importance have followed so fast on each other since-
my return to South Africa, and my time has been so occupied with dealing
with each incident severally, that I have had no opportunity for reviewing
the situation as a whole.
130


The present crisis undoubtedly arises out of the Edgar incident.
'that incident merely precipitated a struggle which was certain to come. It
is possible to make too much of the killing of Edgar. It was a shocking,
and in my opinion, a criminal blunder, such as would have excited a popular
outcry anywhere. It was made much worse by the light way in which it was
first dealt with by the public prosecutor and by the attitude of the judge at
the trial. By itself, however, it would not have justified, nor indeed pro-
voked, the present storm. But it happened to touch a particularly sore
place. There is no grievance which rankles more in the breasts of the
Uitlander population than the conduct of the police, who, while they have
proved singularly incompetent to deal with gross scandals like the illicit
traffic, are harsh and arbitrary in their treatment of individuals whom they
happen to dislike, as must have become evident to you from the recurrent
ill-treatment of colored people. There are absolutely no grounds for sup-
posing that the excitement which the death of Edgar caused was factitious.
It has been laid to the door of the South African League, but the
officials of the league were forced into action by Edgar’s fellow workmen.
And, the consideration of grievances once started by the police grievance, it
was inevitable that the smouldering, but profound discontent of the popula-
tion, who constantly find their affairs mismanaged, their protests disregarded,
and their attitude misunderstood by a government on which they have
absolutely no means of exercising any influence, should once more break into
flame.
We have, therefore, simply to deal with a popular movement of a similar
kind to that of 1884 and 1885 before it was perverted and ruined by a con-
spiracy of which the great body of the Uitlanders were totally innocent.
None of the grievances then complained of, and which then excited universal
sympathy, have been remedied, and others have been added. The case is
much stronger. It is impossible to overlook the tremendous change for the
worse which has been effected by the lowering of the status of the High
Court of Judicature, and by the establishment of the principle embodied in
the new draft Grondwet that any resolution of the Volksraad is equivalent
to a law. The instability of the laws has always been one of the most serious
grievances. The new Constitution provides for their permanent instability,
the judges being bound by their oath to accept every Volksraad resolution as
equally binding with a law passed in the regular form and with the pro-
visions of the Constitution itself. The law prescribing this oath is one of
which the present Chief Justice said that no self-respecting man could sit on
the bench while it was on the Statute-book. Formerly the foreign population,
(however bitterly they might resent the action of the legislature and of the


administration, had yet confidence in the High Court of Judicature, It
cannot be expected that they should feel the same confidence to-day. Seeing
no hope in any other quarter, a number of- Uitlanders who happened to be
British subjects have addressed a petition to her Majesty the Queen. I have
already expressed my opinion of its substantial genuineness, and the absolute
bona fldes of its promoters. But the petition is only one proof among many
of the profound discontent of the unenfranchised population, who are a great
majority of the white inhabitants of the state.
The public meeting of January 14 was indeed broken up by workmen,
many of them poor burghers, in the employment of the government and in-
stigated by government officials, and it is impossible at present to hold
another meeting of a great size. Open-air meetings are prohibited by law,
and by one means or another all large public buildings have been rendered
unavailable. But smaller meetings are being held almost nightly along the
Band, and are unanimous in their demand for enfranchisement. The move-
ment is steadily growing in force and extent.
With regard to the attempts to represent that movement as artificial, the
work of scheming capitalists or professional agitators, I regard it as a wilful
perversion of the truth. The defenceless people who are clamouring for a.
redress of grievances are doing so at great personal risk. It is notorious that
many capitalists regard political agitation with disfavour because of its effect
on markets. It is equally notorious that the lowest class of Uitlanders, and
especially the illicit liquor dealers, have no sympathy whatever with the
cause of reform. Moreover, there are in all classes a considerable number
who only want to make money and clear out, and who while possibly sympa-
thising with reform, feel no great interest in a matter which may only concern
them temporarily. But a very large and constantly increasing proportion of
the Uitlanders are not birds of passage ; they contemplate a long residence in
the country or to make it their permanent home. These people are the main-
stay of the reform movement as they are of the prosperity of the country.
They would make excellent citizens if they had the chance.
A busy industrial community is not naturally prone to political unresl.
But they bear the chief burden of taxation, they constantly feel in their busi-
ness and daily lives the etfects of chaotic local legislation and of incompetent
and unsympathetic administration; they have many grievances, but they
believe all this could be gradually removed if they had only a fair share of
political power. This is the meaning of their vehement demand for enfran-
chisement. Moreover they are mostly British subjects, accustomed to a free
system and equal rights ; they feel deeply the personal indignity involved in>


a position of permanent subjection to the ruling caste, which owes its wealth
and power to their exertion. The political turmoil in the Transvaal Republic
will never end till the permanent Uitlander population is admitted to a share
in the government, and while that turmoil lasts there will be no tranquillity
or adequate progress in her Majesty’s South African dominions.
The relations between the British colonies and the two Republics are
intimate to a degree which one must live in South Africa in order fully to
realise. Socially, economically, ethnologically, they are all one country, the
two principal white races are everywhere inextricably mixed up ; it is absurd
for either to dream of subjugating the other. The only condition on which
they can live in harmony and the country progress is equality all round.
South Africa can prosper under two, three, or six governments, but not under
two absolutely conflicting social and political systems, perfect equality for
Dutch and British in the British colonies side by side with permanent subjec-
tion of British to Dutch in one of the Republics. It is idle to talk of peace
and unity under such a state of affairs.
It is this which makes the internal condition of the Transvaal Republic a
matter of vital interest to her Majesty’s government. No merely local ques-
tion effects so deeply the welfare and peace of her own South African posses-
sions. And the right of Great Britain to intervene to secure fair treatment of
the Uitlanders is fully equal to her supreme interest in securing it. The
majority of them are her subjects, whom she is bound to protect. But the
enormous number of British subjects, the endless series of their grievances,
and the nature of those grievances, which are not less serious because they are
not individually sensational, makes protection by the ordinary diplomatic means
impossible. We are, as you know, for ever remonstrating about this, that,
and the other injury to British subjects. Only in rare cases, and only when
we are very emphatic, do we obtain any redress. The sore between us and
the Transvaal Republic is thus inevitably kept up, while the result in the
way of protection to our subjects is lamentably small. For these reasons it
has been, as you know, my constant endeavor to reduce the number of our
complaints. I may sometimes have abstained when I ought to have protested
from my great dislike of ineffectual nagging. But I feel that the attempt to
remedy the hundred and one wrongs springing from a hopeless system by
taking up isolated cases is perfectly vain. It may easily lead to war, but will
never lead to real improvement.
The true remedy is to strike at the root of all these injuries—the political
impotence of the injured. What diplomatic protests will never accomplish,
a fair measure of Uitlander representation would gradually but surely bring


about. It seems a paradox, but it is true, that the only effective way of pro-
tecting our subjects is to help them to cease to be our subjects. The admis-
sion of Uitlanders to a fair share of political power would, no doubt, give
stability to the Republic. But it would at the same time remove most of
our causes of difference with it, and modify and in the long run entirely
remove that intense suspicion and bitter hostility to Great Britain which at
present dominates its internal and external policy.
The case for intervention is overwhelming. The only attempted answer
is that things will right themselves if left alone. But, in fact, the policy of
leaving things alone has been tried for years, and it has led to their going
from bad to worse. It is not true that this is owing to the raid. They were
going from bad to worse before the raid. We were on the verge of war before
the raid, and the Transvaal was on the verge of revolution. The effect of
the raid has been to give the policy of leaving things alone a new lease of life,
and with the old consequences.
The spectacle of thousands of British subjects kept permanently in the
position of helots, constantly chafing under undoubted grievances, and
calling vainly to her Majesty’s government for redress, does steadily under-
mine the influence and reputation of Great Britain and the respect for the
British government within the Queen’s dominions. A certain section of the
Press, not in the Transvaal only, preaches openly and constantly the doctrine
of a Republic embracing all South Africa, and supports it by menacing refer-
encee to the armaments of the Transvaal, its alliance with the Orange Free
State, and the active sympathy which, in case of war, it would receive from
a section of her Majesty’s subjects. I regret to say that this doctrine, sup-
ported as it is by a ceaseless stream of malignant lies about the intentions of
her Majesty’s government, is producing a great effect upon a large number of
our Dutch fellow colonists. Language is frequently used which seems to
imply that the Dutch have some superior right even in this colony to their
fellow-citizens of British birth. Thousands of men peaceably disposed, and
if left alone, perfectly satisfied with their position as British subjects, are
being drawn into disaffection, and there is a corresponding exasperation on
the side of the British.
I can see nothing which will put a stop to this mischievous propaganda
but some striking proof of the intention of her Majesty’s government not to
be ousted from its position in South Africa. And the best proof alike of its
power and its justice would be to obtain for the Uitlanders in the Transvaal
a fair share in the government of the country which owes everything to their
axertions. It should be made perfectly clear that our action was not directed


against the existence of the Republic. We should only be demanding th»
re-establishment of rights which now exist in the Orange Free State, and
which existed in the Transvaal itself at the time of and long after the with-
drawal of British sovereignty. It would be no selfish demand, as other
Uitlanders besides those of British birth would benefit by it. It is asking
for nothing from others which we do not give ourselves. And it would
certainly go to the root of the political unrest in South Africa, and though
temporarily it might aggravate, it would ultimately extinguish the race feud
which ila the great bane of the country.
TEE BLOEMFONTEIN CONFERENCE.
The result of this energetic despatch was that the High Com-
missioner was authorised to enter into negotiations with President
Kruger ; and these led to the celebrated conference at Bloemfon-
tein, the capital of the Orange Free State. This met towards the
end of May, the British Government being represented by the High
Commissioner, Sir Alfred Milner; the Imperial Secretary, Mr. G.
V. Fiddes; and the Imperial Military Secretary, Lieutenant-
Colonel Hanbury Williams; and the Transvaal government by
President Kruger; the State Attorney, Mr. Smuts ; Mr. Schalk
Burger, Mr. Wolmarans, and Mr. Van Hoytema. The chair
was taken by Mr. A. Fischer, of the Orange Free State, who also
acted as interpreter.
The High Commissioner explained the views of her Majesty’s
government, urged that the anomalous position of the Uitlanders
could not be allowed to continue, and proposed (1) That the num-
ber of years’ residence in the Transvaal for the acquisition of the
franchise should be fixed at five, with retroactive effect; (2) That
the naturalisation oath should be modified ; (3) That a fair repre-
sentation should be given to the new population ; and (4) That
naturalisation should immediately carry with it the full right to
vote. This proposal was at once rejected as quite inadmissable,
President Kruger offering instead to grant the franchise on a two
years’ registration, followed by naturalisation, and a further resi-
dence of five years. This offer, was, however, so clogged with


obstacles that it was practically rendered valueless. Moreover,
the question of the British suzerainty was raised, strong efforts
being made by Kruger to get an acknowledgment that this did not
•exist. With this view, he affected to treat on a tone of perfect
equality, arguing that the Transvaal was an independent State
treating with another independent State. He, therefore, offered
to submit the matters in dispute to arbitration, and when this was
refused, suggested large concessions in return tor an absolute
renunciation of the suzerainty. After sittings extending for more
than a week, the conference failed to come to any agreement;
President Kruger definitely declining to grant the reforms de-
manded of him.
After the failure of the conference Sir Alfred Milner returned
to Capetown, where he was received with great enthusiasm, for it
was recognised that in refusing to be either bullied or cajoled he
had deserved well of his countrymen. On June the 10th, in reply
to an address, he made a speech, in which he outlined the course
of the negotiations which had taken place, and pointed out how the
concessions offered by the Transvaal government had been clogged
with conditions which rendered them of little value. The scheme
offered, he said, was hampered with so many restrictions of the
most elaborate kind, that it was a measure designed rather for
keeping the Uitlanders out of any management of the country,
rather than for letting them in.
DECISIVE BRITISH ACTION.
The failure of the conference naturally caused something like
a shock in South Africa, but it was recognised that, from a British
point of view, some decisive action was now necessary. The
British government fully concurred in this and it was deter-
mined to at once strengthen the British forces in Cape Colony
and Natal. For this purpose a contingent of over ten thousand
men were ordered to leave India for the Cape, several regiments
being also sent from England. The Boer government, on its side,


was not behind hand in its preparations. Large quantities of
arms and amunition were, imported, while immense stores of all
kinds of food were got together.
All hope of trying to bring President Kruger to reason was
not yet abandoned, however. Mr. Chamberlain sent a despatch
to Pretoria, making fresh proposals. In reply to this the President
again urged that he would only grant what was previously offered,
on condition that the suzerainty was relinquished. To this an
unqualified refusal was returned. At the same time active steps
were taken for the despatch of an army corps of forty thousand
men from Great Britain, Sir Redvers Buller being appointed to
the supreme military command in South Africa.
Even at the last moment an effort to avert hostilities was
made by Great Britain, and a further despatch was sent to
Pretoria. This embodied a demand for :
A five years’ franchise, retrospective and prospective, for
Uitlanders.
The allotment of one-fourth of the seats in the Yolksraad to
the representation of the goldfields districts, the population of
which consists chiefly of Uitlanders.
The English and Dutch languages to be placed on a footing
of equality in official and political affairs.
Equality of rights in Presidential and other elections for the
new burghers (enfranchised under the five years’ clause) with the
old (Boer) burghers.
A conference to be held between an authorised representative
of the Transvaal and a British delegate to settle the details of the
new franchise, and arrange for guarantees to be given by the
Transvaal for the due performance of the conditions set forth in
the previous clauses.
The despatch, in conclusion, stated that unless a definite
acceptance of the terms set out were forthcoming, Great Britain
would take steps to secure a settlement of the Transvaal
question.


When this was received it was currently reported that the
Volksraad would adjourn for ten days in order to allow its
members to consult the burghers. This was a mere ruse to gain
time for the arrival of further armaments, for the reply to the
despatch was agreed to before the adjournment. It was handed
to the British agent early in September, and was a simple defiance
of Great Britain. The suzerainty was definitely repudiated, and the
demand for an equality of languages in the Transvaal was
rejected.
Some years previously a defensive alliance had been made
between the Orange Free State and the South African Republic.
During the course of the protracted negotiations the government
of the former exerted all its influence to induce the Transvaal
government to accommodate matters. Some surprise was there-
fore felt when it was announced that the Executive of the Orange
Free State endorsed the despatch announcing the final resolve o|
the Transvaal government, more especially so as the Uitlanders in
the Free State had always been fairly treated. The Orange Free
State Volksraad met on September the 21st, however, and passed
a resolution deciding to stand by the Transvaal in the event
of war.
WAR.
On the 30th of September the Imperial Cabinet met in
London and formulated a series of conditions for acceptance by
the Transvaal government, failing which it was announced that
coercive action would be taken. While the general purport of
these were made public, they were withheld from presentation for
a few days, to give the Boers an opportunity of giving way without
doing so under a threat. On the sth October, however, the
Government at Pretoria forestalled all further action on the
British side by presenting an ultimatum. By this it was
announced that the arrival of further British troops would be
regarded as a casus belli, and war would be declared without


further notice. As the troops from India arrived a few days after-
wards, aggressive action was at once taken by the allied Transvaal
and Orange Free State armies. Gold to the value of over
£500,000 was seized in Johannesburg, the railways were taken
over for military purposes, and an immense exodus of Uitlanders
from the Rand took place. In a few days the British Agent left
Pretoria, and a state of war existed.
