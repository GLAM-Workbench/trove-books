The inventor of the Machine designed to accompany this book
being a practical engineer, and having multiplied calculations to
make, felt the necessity of some simple instrument to aid in calcu-
lation. After much thought and labor, he has succeeded in pro-
ducing such an instrument—simple in construction, and portable in
®c, yet so complete that every variety of calculation may be com-
puted by it, from the school-boy’s easy sum to the most intricate
computation. Its operations are so simple, that it does not require
great power of mind to comprehend them ; they can be applied by
>ny one to the common business purposes of life.
For Engineers, Constructors, Ship-builders, and for Navigation,
4is Calculator will be found the most valuable assistant in figuring.
For trigonometrical calculations, it is so arranged that it is not ne-
cessary to notice the trigonometrical lines as sin. cos., &c., operating
ol >ly by the angles themselves. This makes triognometrical calcula-
llo ns so simple, that any one that can read figures, will be able to
solve trigonometrical questions. Its great recommendation is, the-
rapidity with which calculations can be made; —what, by the ordi-
“ury method, is the work of hours, filling pages with figures, can be
®ns in a f ew seconds, without figures. Many important calculations
u e dispensed with, and often thrown aside before completion, owing
*° 4e length of time required to compute them.
, For Teachers it will be found to be a valuable assistant, furnish-
a test of the real acquirements of the pupil, without taxing the
'■®e of the teacher. Teachers are generally dependent upon text
°°ks for examples, and it is easy for the pupil, knowing where the
'tample comes from, to be furnished with an answer ; but an inge-
|! ,0 «3 teacher, furnished with one of these Calculators, may vary
Samples ad infinitum, and have the answer almost in an instant
i°re him. The pupil is thrown on his own resources for the proper
**®tion of the problem.
All the calculations in Nystrom’s Pocket-Book of Mechanics and
ln Smeering, have been computed by this instrument,
h Was invented in 1848, received a First Premium at the Franklin
Sst >tute Exhibition in 1849, and Patented March 4, 1851.


NYSTROM’S
CALCULATOR.




DESCRIPTION AND KEY
TO THE
CALCULATOR.
The Calculator consists of a round disk of brass, silvered white.
Ithas two graduated arms A and B, extending from the centre C to
the periphery. On the outer end of each arm is a screw e, for the
purpose of fastening the arms in any particular place on the disk.
In the centre is a screw C, to clamp the two arms together; when
clamped they can be moved freely around the centre C.
The operation of calculation is performed by moving these arms
together and independently; for each operation the arm B must be
set in one particular place on the disk called Zero. In order to be
correct, and facilitate the setting of the arm B on Zero, there is placed
aspring E, which is to be operated when the arm approaches it; this
is done by pinching the spring with the fore-finger, and the arm
stops at Zero. A little practice, and this is done with great facility.
The Calculator has four different scales, marked on the arms thus :
a, log, sin, cos, and points.
THE FIRST SCALE a.
The outer scale a is for multiplication, division, involution and
solution. It has two sizes of figures, of which the larger ones repre-
sents the first figure in a number, and the smaller ones the second;
for instance, 28 is a number composed of two figures; 2is the first
figure, 8 the second.
Example. To set the arm Aon number 28 (circle a). Set the
>na A on the large 2, (circle a), move the arm further until it comes
10 the small 8, (the eighth curved line from the large 2;) fasten the
Mm A with the screw e ; the arm is then set on 28. But this 28
'an represent any multiple or divisor of 10; as
0-0028, 0-28, 2-8, 28, 280, 28000, &c. -
If the number contains more than two figures, as 2835, the third
and fourth figures are to be found on the arm where it intersects the
curved line; the third figure is the small figure on the arms, (counted
from a,) and the fourth figure the small divisions between the figures
cu the arms.


OPERATION.
Place the instrument in a position as represented by the accompa-
nying figure, manoeuvre the arm A and screw e by the left hand,
and the arm B with the right.
MULTIPLICATION.
Rule I. Set the arm Aon the first factor, fasten A 6 ;* set the arm
B on Zero, clamp C f loose Ac, and move the arms until the atm B
comes to the second factor; then the arm A shows the product.
Example 1. Multiply 3by 2. Set the arm Aon 3, (circle o,) and
B on Zero, clamp C, move them until the arm B comes to 2; then
the arm A shows the product = 6.
Example 2. Multiply 4by 2. Set the arm Aon 4, fasten A®, set
tlie arm B on Zero, clamp C, loose A®, move the arms until B comes
to 2 ; the arm A will show the product = 8.
Example 3. Multiply 6 by 4. Set A on 6, fasten A®, set B on Zen,
clamp C, loose A®, move the arms until B comes to 4, then A shows
the product = 24.
Example 4. Multiply 9 by 7. Set A on 9, fasten A®, set B on Zero.
clamp C, loose A®, move the arms until B comes to 7 ; then A shows
the product = 63.
Example 5. Multiply 12 by 3. Set Aon 12, (the second curved
line from the large 1,) fasten A®, set B on Zero, clamp C, loose A e ,
move the arms until B comes to 3; then the arm A shows the pro-
duct = 36.
Example 6. Multiply 36 by 6. Set Aon 36, fasten A®, set Bon
Zero, clamp C, loose A®, move the arms until B comes to 6 ; then the
arm A shows the product = 216. The third figure, 6, will be found
on the arm where the curved line 1 intersects the same at figure 6
on the arm A, counted from a.
Example 7. Multiply 216 by 16. 216x16=3225. The fourth
figure, 5, is the fifth division between 2 and 3 on the arm, counted
from a.
Example 8. What is the area of a rectangle in square feet, when
one side is 3 feet 6 inches, and the other 1 foot 9 inches 1 Set Aon
3-5, Bon Zero, clamp B, move the arms until B comes to 1-75; then
the arm A shows the answer, 61-25 square feet.
Example 9. A pine board is 16 feet 3 inches long, and 9 inches
wide; how many square feet are there in it 1 Set Aon 16-25, Bon
Zero, clamp C, move the arms until B comes to 0-75, (9 inches = O' 7 ®
jeet;) then A shows the answer = 12-19 square feet.
* The arm A with the screw e.
t The arms A and B with the screw C.


Example 10. How much will the same board cost at 4 cents per
square foot 1 Set Aon IS-19, Bop Zero, clamp C, move the arms
until B comes to 4 ; then A shows the answer = 48-75 cents.
Example 11. How long is the periphery of a circle 15 inches in
Jiimeter 1 Set Aon 15, Bon Zero, clamp C, move the arms until B
comes to 3-14; then A shows the answer = 47-13 inches.
Example 12. The driving wheel on a locomotive is 5 feet 6 inches;
in diameter how long is the periphery 1 Set Aon 5-5, Bon Zero,
clamp C, move the arms until B comes to 3-14; then A shows the
answer = 17-27 feet.
Example 13. How much for 39 yards of ribbon, at 5 cents per
yard? 39 x 5 = $l-95. Set Aon 39, Bon Zero, clamp C, move
the arms until B comes to 5; then A will show the answer = s'l-95.
Example 14. How many square yards are there in a piece of cloth
37 yards and 29 inches long, and 2 yards and 18 inches wide ? 29
inches = 0-75 yds., 18 in. =? 0-5 yds. 37-75 X 3-5 = 94-37 square
yards.
Example 15. When butter costs 23 cents per pound, how much
hr 23 pounds 1 23 X 33 = $5-29.
Example 16. What will be the cost of a fly-wheel weighing 768
pounds, at 5 cents per pound 3 768 X 5 = $3B-40.
When there are more than two factors to be multiplied together,
consider the product of the two factors as one factor, and continue
the multiplication with the next factor as before described. It mat-
ters not how many factors there may be, the multiplication can be
continued to any extent, but a correct account of the index of the
factors must be kept, as described on page 14. The products which
come between the operations need not be observed, only the last
product.
A calculating machine of only nine inches in diameter, cannot
give more than the four first figures correct; the rest must be filled
op with ciphers (0). In common calculations, a result in four figures
will generally suffice. For higher numbers, the remainder of the fig-
ares are commonly ciphers; these the machine tells to any extent.
But if the. calculation is an important one, requiring a dozen or more
figures in the result, make the calculation by hand, but do not trust
to the first result being correct. The second time proves the calcula-
tion by the machine ; by it you are sure of obtaining the four first
figures correct, which are always most important; for the last figures
the operation by hand can be trustedi,
We will see by the following, that this instrument easily manoeu-
T tes numbers with 10 or 20 figures, but in such examples there is
more or less divisions or extraction of roots, which considerably re-
duces the number of figures before the result is obtained.


Example 17. 2x3x4=24. Set the arm A on 2, B on Zero, clamp
C, move the arms until B comes to 3, fasten A®, loose C, set B on Zen
clamp C, loose A®, move the arms until B comes to 4; the arm A will
show the product=24.
It will be seen in this example, that the product of 2 and 3 was
not noticed; the multiplication was continued by 4, and the product
first noticed was 24.
Example 18. What will be the cost of a lot of ground 135 feel
long and 73 feet wide, at 6 cents per square foot? 135x73x0-06
= $591-30. Set A on 135, B on Zero, clamp C, move the arms until
B comes to 73, fasten A®, loose C, set B on Zero, clamp C, loose As,
move the arms until B comes to 6 ; then the arm A will show the
price= $591-30.
Example 19. What will be the cost of a piece of cloth, 63 yards
long and 2J yards wide, at $l-56 per square yard? 63x2-sxl-56
=5236-25. Set A on 63, B on Zero, clamp C, move the arms until
B comes to 2-5, fasten A®, loose C, set B on Zero, clamp C, loose
A®, move the arms until B comes to 1-56 ; the arm A will show the
cost=s236-25.
Example 20. What is the area of a circle 7 inches in diameter!
7X7XO-785=38-48. Set Aon7, B on Zero, clamp C, move the
arms until B comes to 7, fasten A®, loose C, set B on Zero, clamp C,
loose A®, move the arms until B comes to 0-785; then B shows the
area=3B.4B square inches.
Example 21. What is the area of a circle with a radius of 11 feet!
11X11X3-14=95 square feet.
When a number is to be multiplied by itself, it will be marked
with an exponent of the power, as llXll=H 2 > 12x 12X 12=12 ! .
Example 22. How many cubic inches are contained in an iron
bar 3 inches square and 3 feet long? 3 2 X 12x3=324.
Example 23. How many cubic inches are contained in an iron
bar 27 inches long, 3 inches wide, and 2 inches thick ?
27x3x2=162 cubic inches.
Example 24. How many cubic inches are contained in an iron
bar 2 inches in diameter and 5 feet long ? 2 2 X0-7SSX 12x5= 188-4.
Example 25. What will be the weight of an iron bar 3 inches in
diameter and 7 feet 6 inches long, if one cubic inch weighs 0-28
pounds? 3 2 X0-785X12X7-sxo-28= 178 pounds.
Example 26. What will be the price of an iron bar 9 feet 3 inches
long, 3 J inches wide, and f inches thick, at 7 cents per pound!
9-25 X 3-5 X Q-75X 0-28 X 7=so-47-5.
Example 27. What will be the weight of a propeller shaft of
wrought iron 61 feet long and 1 foot in diameter, when a cubic foot of
wrought iron weighs 486-6 pounds.
1 2 X 0-785 X 61X 486-6 =23,3oopounds.


DIVISION.
Division is the reverse of Multiplication, as the dividend is the
product of the divisor and quotient.
Rule 11. Set the arm A on the dividend, and B on the divisor,
(circle a,) clamp C, move the arms until B comes to Zero ; then the
tm A shows the quotient.
Example 1. Divide Sby 2. Set A0n6,8 on 2, clamp C, move
the arms until B comes to Zero ; then A shows the product= 3.
Example 2. Divide Bby 4. Set AonB, B on 4, clamp C, move
lie arms until B comes to Zero ; then A shows the product=2.
Example 3. Divide]! 2 by 4. Set Aon 12, Bon 4, clamp C, move
tie arms until B comes to Zero ; then A shows the product=3.
Example 4. Divide 24 by 6. 24: 6 = 4.
“ 5. “ 36 “4. 36: 4 = 9.
“ 6. “ 48 “ 6. 48: 6 = 8.

“ 11. “ 378 “ 9. ' 378: 9 = 42.
“ 12. “ 864 “ 27. 864: 27 = 32.
“ 13. “ 5032 “ 68. 5033: 68 = 74.
Example 14. A piece of ribbon containing 12 yards, was sold for
$3. What was the price per yard 1 Set Aon 3, Bon 12, clamp
C, move the arms until B comes to Zero ; then A shows the an-
swer=-25 cents.
Example 15. If 23 yards of cloth cost -$l6l, what will be the price
peryard 1 Set Aon 161, Bon 23, clamp C, move the arms until B
comes to Zero ; A will show the answer=s7.
Example 16. A cog wheel weighing 4750 pounds cost $l9O.
Required the price per pound? Set Aon 190,8 on 4750, clamp
c, move the arms until B comes to Zero ; A will show the an-
swer, = 4 cents.
Example 17. A screw propeller of cast iron, weighing 6950
pounds cost $417. Required the price per pound?
417: 6950=0-06 cents.
When the dividend contains more than one factor, multiply the
lectors by Rule 1., and divide by the divisor according to Rule 11.

then the answer is 10 days 17} hours.
PROPORTION.
Rule 111. The manoeuvring of proportions, is the most valuable
faculty of this instrument. Suppose we have the proportion as 3: 2.
Set Aon 3, and B on 2, clamp B. Now, wherever the arms will
be placed on the disk, the numbers at A and B will always be in the
proportion as 3: 2. Set Aon 6, tho arm B will show 4. Set Bon
24, the arm A will show 36. Set A on 19-93, and B will show 13-29,
4c., &c., &c.
In whatever proportion the arms are once clamped, it will remain
M in any other position on the disk.
Constructors, Draughtsmen, Ship-builders, &c., &c., will find this
»most valuable assistance; when changing a machine, or drawing
from one scale to another, any scales are instantly at hand on the
calculator; by once placing the arms in the proportion of reduction,
any measure ip feet and inches on one arm will shory the reduced
»increased measure at the other arm,
To Ship-builders particularly, it will meet the highest, approbation,
"hen enlarging and reducing lines of vessels ; and at the same time,
the Calculator covers all the Ship-builder’s calculations. '
Example 1. 8 : 14’= 24 : ap. Set the arm B on 8, and, A on
14, clamp O, move the prma until B comes to 24, tlien A shows the
fourth term a:=42.
Example 2. 1-35 : 97-6 =x : 49,-63. Set" Aop 1-35, Bop 976,
damp C, move the arms until B comes to 49-53, the arm A will
show the third term a:=o-6864.


FRACTIONS.
To reduce a vulgar fraction to a decimal, or to another vulgar
fraction.
Rule IV. Set the arm Aon the numerator, and B on the denomi-
nator, clamp C, move the arms until B comes to Zero,- then A shows
the decimal. '
Example 1. Reduce Jto a decimal. Set Aon 1, Bon 2, clamp
C, move the arms until B comes to Zero ,- then A shows the deci-
mal =O-5.
Example 2. Reduce } to a decimal. Set A0n3,8 on 4, clamp
C, move the arms until B comes to Zero ,- then A shows the deci-
mal=o-75.
Example 3. Reduce fto a decimal. Set A0n5,8 on 9, clamp
C, move the arras until B comes to Zero; then A shows the deci-
mal = 0-5555.
Example 4. Reduce ts • ’ = 0-5384.
“ 5. “ T 95 . . . = 0-6000.
“ 6. “ |f . . = 0-6368.
“ 7. “ M • . . = 0-5925.
“ 8. “ || . , . = 0-4810.
“ 9. “ -if! .-•• . . = 0-3387.
“ 10. “ - . = 0-1338.

To reduce a vulgar fraction to another vulgar fraction.
Example 11. Reduce }to 12ths. Set the arm Aon 3, Bon 4,
clamp C, move the arms until B comes to 12; then A shows 9or
9-12=}. In whatever position the arms are placed on the disk, the
numbers will always remain in the same proportion as 3 :4. In
this consists the great convenience of the machine for working vulgar
fractions.
Example 12. Reduce ||| to Bths. Set A on 135, B on 216,
clamp C, move the arms until B comes to 8 ; then A shows=s or S-
Example 13. Reduce |f to 3ds. = 1 6 -

product = 18.
Example 15. || *365 =177-8... ;
Example 16. 2 2 3 jX|g= 5 0'05235,


INVOLUTION.
The power of a number is only a multiplication by the number
itself, and is marked by a small figure called exponent, on the
right of the number.
Example 1. What is the square of 3 1 3 2 =9. Set Aon3, B
tnZero, clamp C, move the arms until B comes to 3; then A shows
tiepower=9. To obtain the third power of 3, continue the multi-
plication by 3; but the fourth power of 3, or
34=92=81.
36=93=729.
3>=9 4 =B1 2 =6561.
3 8 =9 4 x3=B1 2 x36561x3= 19683.
Example 2. Compute the 9th power of 3. Set A on 3, B on
Im, clamp C, move the arms until B comes to 3; then A shows
!=3 J ; fasten A e , loose C, set Bon Zero, clamp C, loose A®, move
the arms until B comes to 9; then A shows 81 = 9 2 =3 4 ; fasten A®,
loose C, set B on Zero, clamp C, loose A®, move the arms until B
tomes to 81; then A shows 6561=81 2 =9 4 =3 8 ; fasten A®, loose C,
set B on Zero, clamp C, loose A®, move the arms until B comes to
3; then A shows the 9th power of 3, or 19683=3 9 .
INTEREST.
Example 1. What is the interest on 765 dollars at 6 per cent.
I«i annum 1
Set A on 6, (circle a,) B on Zero, clamp C, move the arms until
8 comes to $765, then A shows the interest=s4s-90.
On whatever number of dollars the arm B is set, the arm A will
the interest for one year; or if the arm A be set on any interest
per annum, B will show the capital. If the interest is to be found
" >ny number of years, months, or days, let the arm A remain on
®c interest for one year,
{Zero if number of years, T
365 “ “ days, J
Now for any number of years, months, weeks, or days on the arm
" “ e interest will be found on the arm A.

Example 2. Require the interest of 34,770 dollars for 13 mentis at
6 per cent, per annum 1
Set A on $34,770, B on Zero; clamp C, move the arms until B
comes to 6 per cent., fasten A®, set B on 12, clamp C, move the armi
until B comes to 13 months, then A shows the interest, $2250.
Example 3. A,capital $05,680 gave an interest $10,840 in 3ycati
and 5 months. Required the per centage per annum ?
Three years and 5 months is 41 months.
Set A on the interest $10,840, and B on the capital $65,660;
clamp C, move the arms until B comes to 12 months, fasten A', set
B on 41 months, clamp C, move the arms until B comes to Zero:
A shows the annual per centage 4 y per cent.
Example 4. What capital is required to give an interest 1500
dollars per year, at 6 per cent, per annum 1
Set A on the interest $l5OO, and B on 6 per cent., clamp C,
move the arm until B comes to Zero, then A shows the capital re-
quircd»=s2s,ooo.
LOGARITHMS.
The second scale log. is for addition and subtraction; and also,
the logarithm for the number in the circle a.
Example 1. Find the logarithm of 47211
Set the arm A on 4721, (circle o,) and the logarithm wilt be
found where the curved line 6 intersects the arm, which is 3-6740.
The index of the logarithm is always one less than the number
of figurcsin the number ; it is not to be found on the calculator, only
the decimal part 6740, of which the first figure 6 is the 6th curw
line in circle log. The second figure 7is on the arm, countedftom
log:, and the third figure 4 is the fourth division between 7 asd 8,
where the curved line intersects the, arm. The decimal, part of*
logarithm is called mantissa. It is well known that in the system
of logarithms, the index is always one less than the number of fig-
ures in the number for which the logarithm is to be found; as. I°?'
7000=3-845. Here the number is four figures, and the index 4—*
=3; but the mantissa is the same as for 7.
In calculations, where the number of figures in the result isM'
certain, a correct account must be kept of the indices. For to*
purpose, there is a small hand on the screw C, which is to be raon
by the hand for each operation with the arms; as, for multipliM ll^


tdd the factors’ indices, the sum is the index for the product; and
for division, subtract the index for the divisor from the index for the
dividend, the remainder is tho index for the quotient. When the
(perations are finished, the small hand shows the index; add one to
iq gives the number of figures in tho result. If the index becomes
negative, the result is a corresponding decimal fraction, and the hand
(lows how many oit is before the figures included the unity 0. If
ihearm shows 28, (circle a,) and the hand show's tho
Index —3 the decimal fraction is 0-0028
Index —2 “ “ 0-028
Index —•! “ “ 0-28
Index 0 the number is 2-8
Index +1 “ 28
Index +3 “ 2800
Index -f 6 “ 2800000
If it is made a rule to move the arms with the arrow for multipli-
tation, and opposite the arrow for division, it follows that when, for
multiplication, the arm A moves over Zero, add 1 to the index, and
for division subtract I from the index; but as it is more convenient
to move the arm to the nearest factor, these rules will not be follow-
ed, and the arms will be moved in every direction for any operation.
Then it must be observed that, for multiplication or division, when
the arm A moves over Zero with the arrow, add 1 to the index; and
subtract 1 if it moves over Zero opposite the arrow.
Example 1. Multiply 36800 by 2250.
Set Aon 36800, and the small band on the index 4. Set B on
Sro, clamp C, move the arms until B comes to 2250, add the index
3t04, which will be 7, and indicates that there arc eight figures in
the product, which will be found on A 82800000.
Example 2. Multiply 582500 by 88000.
Set Aon 88000, and the small hand on the index 4. Set B on
hn, damp C, move the arms until B comes to 582500, add the
mdei 5 to 4, which will be 9 ; if the arms were moved with the ar-
rows, the arm A moved over Zero, and one more is to be added to
4e index, 9 or 10 is the index for the product, which indicates that
4ere are 11 figures in the product on A 51260000000.
The account of the index is but trifling after a little practice. If
™re is a supposition as to what the number of figures in the result
be, the account of the index need not be kept.


Example 3. A ship’s crew of 300 men were so supplied with pro-
visions for 12 months, that each man was allowed 30 ounces per
day, but after being out 6 months, they found it would require 9
months more to finish it, and 50 of their number were lost. It is
required to find the daily allowance of each man during the last
nine months.
300X30 (12—6) 300 30 6 ..
i L— — x X =24 ounces.
9 (300 —5O) 9 250
Set A on 300, B on 9, clamp C, move the arms until B comes to
30, fasten A°, loose C, set B on 250, clamp C, loose A®, move the
arms until B comes to 6; then A shows the answer, 24 ounces.
Here is five factors computed in two operations.
When complicated questions are to be solved, it is best to set it
up in the form of equation, and it will be managed by the calculator
almost instantly.
For complicated examples we refer to Nystrom’s Pocket-Book of
Mechanics and Engineering, which are all calculated by this instru-
ment. Operators will find that Pocket-Book excellent for practising
intricate examples. From pages 206 and 207 we extract the fol-
lowing example:
A hand pump is to throw up 25 cubic
feet of water 17 feet high, in a time of 9
minutes and 16 seconds. The lever on
which the force F is applied is I =36
inches, and the lever e =9 inches. The
stroke of the piston A is 0-65 feet, and
the force F =23 pounds.
Required how many double strokes the hand pump must male
perminutcl 9x60-}-16=556 seconds.
3630 25 17 9
Number of strokes =—— X -.,X —X =46 J per minute.
550 0*65 23 oo
Set A on 3630, B on 556, clamp C, move the arms until B comes
to 25; fasten A®, loose C, set B on 65, clamp C, move the arms
until B comes to 17, fasten A°, loose C, set B on 23, clamp C,move
the arms until B comes to 9, fasten Ae, loose C, set B on 36, clamp
C,movc the arms until B comes to Zero, then A shows 46-35 which
are the number of strokes per minute required. The product and
quotients in the operation need not be noticed, only notice the re-
sult you want to know. You will here also discover the rules njr
which the operation is performed.


EVOLUTION.
Extraction of Roofs is the reverse of Powers; as, the root of a
number taken to the same power as the index for the root is coequal
to the number. This is to be computed by the circle log. which
contains the logarithms for the number in circle a.
Example 1. What is the square root of 9, or \/ 9 1 Set Aon 9,
the mantissa on circle b is 9542; say 2 in 9 four times, set B on 4,
(circle log) 2 in 15 7, move the arm until the curved line 4 crosses
the division 7, (circle log,) 2 in 14 seven times, move the arm B a
little further, until the curved line crosses the seventh division be-
tween 7 and 8, counted from log i then fasten B c , and you will find
encircle a the answer 3=^/9.
Example 2. What is the square root of 16, or \/l6 1 Set the
irm A on 16, the mantissa on circle log, is 2041, but 16 has an
index 1, which is to be added to mantissan, 1-2041 : 2=o-602 ; set
the ana B on 602, (circle log,) on circle a we have the answer
4 = v^Tfb
Example 3. What is the cube root of 216, or 4/2161 Set Aon
216, the mantissan on circle log is 3344, index=2 ; 2-3344 : 3 =
0- ; set the arm Bon 7781, (circle log,) on circle ais the an-
swer 6 = v/2H!.
Example 4. What is the fourth root of 4/69350 1 Set A on
69350, the mantissan on circle log is 841,indcx=4; 4-841 : 4 =
1- set B on 2102, (circle log,) the index for the answer is 1,
and on circle a is the answer, 16-23.
Example 5. 4/8926000. Set Aon 8926000, the mantissan on
fejis 9506, index=6 ; 6-9506 : 7=o-9929, which corresponds with
9'338, the answer on circle a.
Example 6. What time will it take a ball to fall vertical 231 feet!
time I 2 =3-79 seconds.
\ 32-17
Set A on 231, B on 32-17, clamp C, move the arms until B comes

To extract Roots of Decimals.
Example 1. 0-349. The given index is—1, which is to be
subtracted from the root index=3 —l=2, which will be the index
for the mantissan. Set Aon 349, fasten A°; on circle log. is the
mantissa 5428, and 2-5428 : 3=o-8476. Set Aon 8470, circle log,
then on the circle a will be found the root=o-7041.
When the given index exceeds the root index, it will be as many
ciphers before the figures in the root as the root index contains in
the given index, (excepting the unity cipher.)
Example 2. The given indcx= —lO, and
10 : 4=2 ; the remainder, 2, will be the index for the mantissa. Set
A on 8945, the mamtissan on circle log. is 9515, and 2-9515 : 4=
0-7379. Set Aon 7379, circle log. on circle awe have the root
=O-005469.
Example 3. The given index = —l3,
and 13 : 5=2, which shows there must be two ciphers before the
figures, (excepting the unity 0,) and the remaining 3 is the index
for the mantissa. Set Aon 7528, the mantissan on circle his 8766,
and 3-8766 : s=o-7773. Set Aon 77733, circle b/ on circle awe
have the root =O-005989.
TRIGONOMETRY.
The scale between sin. and cos., marked on the arms, is for trigo-
nometrical calculations. The numbers in the circles sin. and cos.,
are angles in degrees, and the divisions between sin. and cos., shows
the exceeding minutes where the lino intersects the arm.
When the arm is set on an angle circle, sin., the circle a shows
the length of its sinus ,- when set on an angle circle, cos., the circle
a shows the length of its cosine.

NAVIGATION. PLANE SAILING.
Plane Sailing is when navigating a ship with the supposition
that the earth is a level plane, on which the meridians are drawn
north and south, parallel with each other ; and the parallels cast and
west, at right angles to the former.
The line NS, represents a meridian north and south. The line E
W, represents a parallel, cast and west.
A ship in /, sailing in the direction I and having reached f, it
is required to know her position to the point /, which is measured
by the line / /', and the angle N, I and imagined by the lines la,
and a l\
These four quantities bear the following names :
I l' f distance from / to
JV / course or points from the meridian.
I a, departure or difference in longitude.
a difference in latitude.
The calculations for plane sailing arc to be operated by the inner
scale points, in connexion with the outer scales. The points repre-
sent the courses on the mariner’s compass,.and arc laid out from
the trigonometrical scale, so that when the arm is set on a point
numbered in the circle dep.sin . shows the corresponding angle in
degrees and minutes. Set the arm Aon dep. 3J points, an

To Find the Difference in Longitude.
Given the Departure and Latitude.
Example 17. Departure =204 miles, and latitude 61° 35'. Re-
quired the difference in longitude 1
Set Aon the departure 204, Bon the latitude co.s.Gl 0 35', clamp
C, move the arms until B comes to Zero, then A shows the differ-
ence in longitude=42B.B minutes, divided by 60 gives the difference
in longitude=7° B.B'.
Given the Course, Distance, and Middle Latitude.
Example 18. A ship sailing S. W. by S. (5 points), 115 miles in
a middle latitude 47° 39'. Required her difference in longitude 1
Set Aon the distance 115 miles, B on the middle latitude cos.il 0

points, then A shows the difference in longitude=l42-s', divided by
60 is 2° 22-5' the difference in longitude required.
In working traverse sailing, it is more convenient to find the dif-
ference in latitude and departure by this calculator, than by the or-
dinary method with tables. Instead of setting down the departure
m the transverse table, the difference in longitude can be set down

which is only to place the arm B on cos. for the middle latitude
while A remains on the departure; clamp C, and move the arms
until B comes to Zero, then A shows the difference in longitude in
minutes. This method is more correct than the ordinary one.

Spherical Distances.
In high latitudes and very long distances, the preceding rules
will not give such correct results as may be desired, owing to the
spheroidal form of the earth; but by the aid of spherical trigo-
nometry, we are enabled to ascertain courses and distances correctly
from and between any known points on the earth.
To Find the true Course and Distance be-
tween two Places in the same Latitude.
Example . Boston (North America), and Cape Crcaux (South
Spain), are in the same latitude, about 42° 20', and difference in
longitude 74° 20'. Required the course and distance from Boston
to Cape Creaux?
Set the arm A on Zero, B on half the difference in longitude
sin* 37° 10', clamp C, move the arms until A comes to the latitude
cos.42° 20', then B shows half the distance sin* 26° 32', multiplied
by 2=53° 4', the true distance.
Set A on the difference in longitude sin* 74° 20', B on the dis-
tance sin.s3° 4', clamp C, move the arms until B comes to the lati-

Set the arm A on 158, 15 on 0-96, clamp C, move the arms until
B comes to Zero, then A shows the mantissa 216 (circle log.) the
index is 2, and 2-16 divided by the index of the root 2 is I'loB. Set
A on the mantissa 108, (circle log.), B on Zero, clamp C, move the
arms until B comes to 3, fasten A c , loose C, set Bon Zero, clamp
C, loose A O , move the arms until B comes to 60, then A shows 0-231
gallons.
In this example the indexes must bo carefully operated by the
small band.
