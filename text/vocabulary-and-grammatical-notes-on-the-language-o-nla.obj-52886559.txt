Vocabulary and Grammatical Notes oa the Language of
Makura, Central New Hebrides. Compiled by Sidney H.
Ray, Merab. Anthrop. last. Groat Britain aad Ireland.
The island of Makura is situated about ten miles north of
Nguna or Montagu Island, midway between Efate and Epi, in
the south central portion of the New Hebrides Group. It is of
volcanic origin with hills about 600 feet high. The population is
about 1,000.
For the materials from which this sketch was compiled I am
indebted to the Rev. Oscar Michelsen, Presbyterian Missionary on
the island of Tongoa.
This language is spoken on the islands of Makura, Tongariki,
Buninga, Ewose, and Mataso. It is also spoken on part of the
island of Tongoa. Another language spoken on Tongoa is some-
what different and is substantially the same as that of Nguna or
Montagu Island. ( Gf. Nguna Grammar, in “Jour. Anthrop.
Inst.,” 1887, p. 409.) The Makura language, under the name
Tongoa, is noticed in Dr. Codrington’s “Melanesian Languages,”
p. 471.

§ 2. Nouns.
Nouns are distinguished by the article na, which is, however,
not used with proper names.
There are two classes of nouns. The first class takes a suffixed
possessive pronoun and comprises the names of relationships,
parts of the body, or of things in close connection with the
possessor; other nouns take a separate possessive word. In the
vocabulary nouns which take the suffix have * prefixed.
A verbal noun is formed by the suffix an, the article being
usually prefixed. Nalegan, singing; nadogan, hearing. The
person or thing performing an action is shown by the prefix taka,
which corresponds to the Nguna and Efate tea. Taka ni nadogan,
hearer.
Persons belonging to a place are called its children.
Nati Togoa, people of Tongoa.
The plural sign is emag (Nguna and Efate maga ) following the
noun. Abau is also used.
Collectives are made by the nouns natau, heap, and namoke,
bunch.
Sex is distinguished by the
or navavina, female.

Pronouns.
1. The personal pronouns are
Singular: 1 . Keino ; 2, Ka
Kaig ;
3. Kinini.
Dual and plural: 1. (inclusive of person addressed), Keicite;
(exclusive), Keicem; 2. Kami; 3. Keniare.
The dual and plural are only distinguished by the verbal particles
2. The personal pronouns suffixed to verbs and prepositions are: —
Singular: 1. -oh, ioh; 2. -ak -iak; 3. -in.
Dual and plural: 1. (incl.) -cit, (excel.) cent; 2. cam; 3. iniri.
3. The possessive pronouns suffixed to nouns of the first class
(marked with ♦ in the vocabulary) are:—
Singular: 1. -g; 2. iha; 3. -n.
Dual and plural: 1. (incl.), -icite; 1. (exclus.) -team; 2. -icam;
3. niare.
' 4. With nouns of the second class the words agi and mini are
used with suffixes as possessive pronouns. Agi denotes a thing
possessed by any one, mini, a thing done for any one. Naifha agino,
my house ; naima minio, a house for me.
Singular 1. agino ... minio.
2. amain ... miniake.

1. (exclus.) anicem ... minicem.
2. aeami ... minicami.
3. aniare, niare miniare.
These words correspond to the Nguna agi and magi which are
used in the same way. The Nguna kaka, a thing belonging to, is
represented in Makura by the word ena. Enan, its belonging, a
thing belonging to it.
5. Interrogative pronouns.


These are : Eehe ? who P Ibe ? what ? which ? Nahihan Jcehe ?
his name who ? Taha ibe ? which one.
4. Adjectives.
the noun. [
Adjectives usually follow the
the prefix ta. The prefix ma of
is very commonly used.

The word for “ bad ” shows
m as in Nguna and Efate
condition

1. Verbs are distinguished by verbal particles which appear to be
(as in Nguna and Efate) shortened forms of the personal pronouns.
These particles are :
Singular: 1. ni ; 2. ho; 3. i.
Dual : 1. (inch), ta; 1. (excl.), mo; 2. Jcia; 3. ria.
Plural: 1. (inch), ti; 1. (excl.), mo; 2. hi; 3. ri.
In the dual first person andu is sometimes added to ta and mo.
The particles are used with or without the personal pronouns.
2. The causative prefix paka is seen in pakale, to feed, and with
adverbs.
3. The sign of quotation is iga. Betog iga pa row, he said that
he would go. Nguna, E noa naga ega vano. This also expresses
the conditional mood. The adverb pe also makes the verb
conditional.
4. Continuous or repeated action is shown by noho, preceding
the verb.
5. Reciprocal action is expressed as in Nguna and Efate by
means of a noun dipo. (Nguna, tuma.)
Ti diponigiti iligiti, we strike one another.
Ki diponicam iligicam, you strike one another.
Bi diponiare iliginire, they strike one another.
6. The imperative is expressed in the singular by ho, in the
plural by hi, preceding the verb. The prohibitive is to ho pa in
the singular, te hu in the plural.
7. A wish is shown by the verb masauna as in Nguna. Ni
masauna pa arah, I wish him to come.
8. The interrogative is usually expressed merely by the into-
nation, but if it is wished to be explicit the word ne is placed at
the end of the sentence.
9. Tense. —The past seems to be the normal tense; the present
is sometimes distinguished by the words no or noho. What has
just happened is expressed by moo. The future sign is pa mo.


All these precede the verb. A completed action is marked by nu
following the verb.

words for “ bring ” and “ take.”

paharu, twice.
4. The interrogatives are : ri hih ? how many ? paha vih ? how

I have no texts in the Makura language. As the island is very
small and the Tongoa-Ngnna language is very widely spread
among the adjacent islands, an endeavour will, no doubt, be made
to bring the latter language into general use. For comparison
the Rev. O. Miohelsen gives the opening clauses of the Lord’s
Prayer. I have added the corresponding parts in the neighbouring
dialects.
