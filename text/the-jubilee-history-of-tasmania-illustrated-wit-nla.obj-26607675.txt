THE BLACK WAR.
(Continued from page 56, Volume I.)
CHAPTER I.
1828-1830.
■ANY who had lived for years with the English, having become familiarised with
their language and customs, again joined their countrymen when they heard of
the slaughter of their relatives, and proved formidable foes. Convict settlers
carrying firearms gave them every assistance, a fact which rendered them very defiant.
They had undergone the most inhuman treatment, and now they had become desperate.
The proclamations issued by the Governor, stating that any outrage on the blacks would
be dealt with in the Supreme Court, were disregarded. At every opportunity the natives
were shot down, and the murderers escaped, there being no proper evidence against
them. Governor Arthur was much distressed with the existing state of affairs. An
Aborigines’ Protection Committee was appointed, consisting of the Revs. Norman and
Bedford and six other gentlemen; but both the Governor and committee were
powerless. A Government order was issued, commanding all the blacks to retire from
the settled districts, and military posts were established on their confines. It was
explained to the blacks that mutual safety necessitated drawing a line of demarcation;
but the plan was a complete failure, as the blacks did not understand the order.
Pictorial proclamations were next resorted to. Boards with sketches were nailed on
the gum trees. On the top was the following representation : —A black woman with a
white infant in her arms, and vice versa ; black girls and white walking hand in hand—
the same friendship being exhibited towards each other by the men; a black chief,
accompanied by his tribe, hurrying forward to shake hands with the Governor and his
party. The counterpart of this sketch showed a black man sending a spear through a
white, who was represented as lying dead under a gallows, whilst his assailant was
hanging by the neck. A white man was sketched as if in the act of shooting a native
who lies dead under the scaffold, the white man hanging by the neck. But these


efforts also proved useless, and it was found necessary to proclaim martial law on Ist
November, 1828. Subsequently a reward of £5 for every adult and £2 for every child
captured without injury was offered. Capture parties were formed, the most
prominent leaders being John Batman, Gilbert Robertson, Jorgen Jorgenson (a Dane,)
Alexander M‘Kay, Howell, Surridge, Parish, Emmett, Nicholas, and Sherwin. The
rewards for capture were not withdrawn until June, 1832. In May, 1829, an order
was issued that only those forming themselves into an organised force would be
recognised as capture parties. Mr. Thomas Anstey, of Anstey Barton, near Oatlands,
undertook to receive monthly reports of the operations from the leaders of the different
parties. Mr. John Batman did good service in the cause; and Mr. Robinson, who
performed some wonderful feats in the undertaking, was extremely successful;
Mr. Howell and Mr. Parish also rendering good service. Batman, in September,
secured three women, two young children, three boys, and two young men, and
seventeen dogs, as well as a quantity of stolen goods. Later in the same month, he
was obliged with his party of ten to fire on an armed mob of seventy natives who had
attacked them. Fifteen natives were slain, one woman and one child being the only
prisoners. For his services he received a reward of 2000 acres of land. Mr. Gilbert
Robertson received a grant of 1000 acres for capturing the chief Eumurvah and four
others in October, 1829. Surridge captured several in 1830.
Governor Arthur, not satisfied with the slow progress made by the capture
parties, resolved to dispose of the native difficulty once and for ever, by the movement
known as
THE BLACK LINE.
The object was to surround the blacks and drive them before an advancing cordon until
they were safely secured on Tasman’s Peninsula. There were 119 leaders of parties, each
of whom had an experienced guide. There were altogether about 3000 persons engaged
in this expedition, of whom 738 were convict servants. The following is a portion of
the proclamation which appeared in the Hohart Town Courier of 25th September, 1830,
and which fully illustrates the feeling, whether right or wrong, of the people :—“ The
community being called upon to meet en masse on the 7th October next, for the purpose
of capturing those hostile tribes of the natives which are daily committing renewed
atrocities upon the settlers, the following outline of the arrangements which the
Lieutenant-Governor has determined upon is published in order that every person may
know the principle on which he is required to act, and the part he is to take
individually in this important transaction. Active operations will at first be chiefly
directed against the tribes which occupy the country south of a line drawn from
Waterloo Point east, to Lake Echo west, including the Hobart, Richmond, New
Norfolk, Clyde, and Oatlands police districts—at least within this country the military
will be mainly employed, the capture of the Oyster Bay and Big River tribes as the
most sanguinary, being of the greatest consequence. In furtherance of this measure,


it is necessary that the natives should he driven from the extremities within the settled
districts of the county of Buckingham, and that they should subsequently be prevented
from escaping out of them, and the following movements are therefore directed:—
First, to surround the hostile native tribes; secondly, to capture them in the county of
Buckingham, progressively driving them upon Tasman’s Peninsula; and thirdly, to
prevent their escape into the remote unsettled districts to the westward and eastward.
. . . Major Douglas will also, on the 7th of October, form a chain of posts from
Campbell Town along the south-west bank of the Macquarie to its junction with the
Lake River. These parties will then advance in a southerly direction, carefully
examining the Table Mount and range on both its sides, and the banks of the Lake
River, and they will halt on the afternoon of the 12th. ... In this movement
Major Douglas will receive the co-operation of the Police Magistrate of Campbell
Town, who will bring forward upon that portion of the line extending from the high
road near Kimberley’s, on the Salt Pan Plains, to Malony’s Sugar Loaf, the force
contributed by Messrs. Willis, W. Harrison, Pearson, Jellicoe, Davidson, McLeod,
Leake, Clarke, Murray, Horne, Scardon, Kermode, Parramore, Horton, Scott,
Dickenson, R. Davidson, Cassidy, Eagle, Gardener, Robertson, Hill, Forster, with
any other settlers from that part of the district. . . . ” Then follow numerous
directions as to how the different bodies were to act, to which reference would in this
book be tedious. In the additional supplement to the Hohart Town Courier , it is
staled that u the arrangements at the different depots for the conveyance of rations
and stores to the parties employed, will be undertaken by Mr. Scott, Mr. Wedge, and
Mr. Sharland; and as the leader of each party will be a respectable individual, he will
keep a ration book, in which he will insert his own name and the names of all his
party, which on his presenting at any of the depots, stating the quantity required, the
respective storekeepers will issue the same, taking care that no greater quantity than
seven days’ supply, consisting of the following articles per diem, viz., 3oz. of sugar,
£oz. of tea, 2lbs. flour, and of meat, for each person shall be issued at one time to
any party. The inhabitants of the country generally are requested not to make any
movements against the natives within the district occupied by the troops, until the
general line reaches them, and the residents of the Jordan on Bagdad line of road will
render the most effectual assistance by joining Captain Wentworth’s force while yet on
the Clyde. The assigned servants of settlers will be expected to muster, provided
each with a good pair of spare shoes and a blanket, and seven days’ provisions,
consisting of flour or biscuit, salt meat, tea and sugar; so also prisoners holding
tickets-of-leave; but these latter, when they cannot afford it, will be furnished with
a supply from the Government magazines. . . . The Lieutenant-Governor takes
this opportuuity of again enjoining the whole community to bear in mind that
the object in view is not to injure or destroy the unhappy savages against whom
these movements will be directed, but to capture and raise them in the scale of


civilisation by placing them under the control of a competent establishment, from
whence they will not have it in their power to escape and molest the white inhabitants
of the colony, and where they themselves will be no longer subject to the miseries of
perpetual warfare, or to the privations which the extension of the settlements would
progressively entail upon them were they to remain in their present unhappy state.”
The march commenced on 7th October, 1830. Captain Donaldson’s Launceston
party of about 350 men displayed great zeal and activity. After having scaled the
heights of the Western Mountains and scoured the country, they met at Kemp’s hut.
Scarcely had Donaldson formed his position southward of Lake Echo, when he
received the Governor’s command to hasten downwards towards Hobart Town. He at
once set out with his company, and after having performed the march in a very short
period of time, announced his arrival to the Governor at Sorrell Town. For this exploit
the division, in a camp bulletin issued on 2nd November by the Governor, was highly
commended. Another division marched from Quamby’s Bluff to the sea at Swanport.
A third division marched from Broadmarsh to Bussell’s Falls, and thence to Hamilton-
on-Clyde, Bothwell, and Crescent Lake. Wentworth’s division was met at Jericho by
Major Douglas and his party, both divisions passing through the country to Little
Swanport on the east coast. On 20th October the lines were connected from
Richmond to Prosser’s Bay, and on 24th from the township of Sorrell to the bay.
Colonel Arthur paid the utmost attention to every detail in connection with this
expedition. He was known to ride as much as fifty miles a day over a rough country
with no roads, and on one occasion was lost for three days in the scrub. The force
extended between Sorrell and the sea, a distance of thirty miles. Each man stood
forty-five yards apart, and between each post a fire was to be kept burning at night.
East Bay Neck, a narrow isthmus connecting Forestier’s Peninsula with the mainland,
was gained. The peninsula was searched, but not a native was to be seen. The only
result of this undertaking was the capture of one man and a boy. The man was
identified as Nickay Marrick, who had speared horses belonging to the Van Diemen’s
Land Company, at Emu Bay.
Owing to a large number of spears, waddies and blankets having been found in
the scrub, it was supposed that a tribe consisting of about seventy people, when they
heard the firing, made a hasty retreat. The expedition cost the Government £30,000,
but the total loss to the country at large was estimated at £60,000. The settlers
returned to their homes with feelings very different to those with which they set out
on the march, and certain it is that those who took part in the expedition never forgot
THE BLACK WAR. The movement, which was a popular one, caused the Governor
to rise in the estimation of the colonists, his exertions in the field calling forth
addresses from all parts of the colony of the most eulogistic description. While a large
force was endeavouring to subdue the natives by grapeshot, there was one man quietly
attempting to accomplish the same work; but his method was entirely different, as he


applied to the case the power of moral suasion. Robinson, although a bricklayer in
Hobart Town, found time to devote to philanthropic work. The natives engaged his
sympathies, and he therefore attempted to acquire a knowledge of their language—a
task which was rather difficult, as the dialects of the tribes differed considerably. He,
however, persevered, and succeeded by his kindly attention and gentle manner in gaining
an extraordinary influence over them. In March, 1899, Governor Arthur caused a
notice to be published in the Gazette offering .£SO a year to any man of good character,
who would take an interest in the unfortunate race, reside on Brune Island, take
charge of provisions and clothing, and look after the interests of any natives who might
be induced to go there. Robinson applied for the post, but at the same time objected
to the paltry sum offered. All philanthropic work receives scant measure, and it is
only when the ear is turned to dust that a man’s worth is acknowledged. Robinson
was appointed at the grand salary of £IOO a year. What a magnanimous offer on the
part of those who are the responsible, or who at least pride themselves upon being so,
advisers of what is beneficial to the country’s welfare! r lhe establishment at Brune
was not a success, due principally to the fact that it was a place of easy access for
people of immoral character. In January, 1830, Robinson entered on his new
mission, of which Mr Jorgenson says; “ I thought Mr. Robinson either a madman or
an impostor.” Robinson selected a few of his Brune blacks to accompany him in the
dangerous enterprise he was undertaking, among whom were Truganini and her
husband, Wooreddy, both of whom remained with him during his bush wanderings.
His party consisted of ten natives and eight Europeans. He landed at Recherche
Bay from Brune Island, and proceeded overland with the company of aborigines and
three armed white men, but found no natives until he reached Port Davey, where a
numerous party appeared in sight, but fled at his approach.
One fortunate circumstance aided him, otherwise his mission would have been
a failure. He sent forward some of his friendly blacks to hold an interview with
their wilder brethren, when one of the women found a long-lost brother with the tribe.
An amicable interview having been effected on 91st January, Robinson, after
travelling and sojourning with the natives for about three weeks, moved on with his
party to Macquarie Harbour, and proceeded northward and eastward until he reached
Emu Bay, He was requested to conciliate, and not, on this occasion, to bring in the
natives, and the impressions he made on the minds of the many tribes with which
he came in contact were favourable to his future exploits.
He traversed the north-east coast country while the Black War was raging in
the south, and rescued eighteen females from the sealers on his visit to some of the
islands in the Straits. When the conciliatory method adopted by Robinson was
proved to be successful, all the armed parties of captors were called in and forbidden
to appear before the natives with firearms in their possession. The blacks were to be
brought in, not shot down. The first place prepared for their reception was Swan


Island, but it was found unsuitable for a permanent settlement. Gun Carriage
(Yansittart) Island was also abandoned, as it was too small, and it lacked a supply of
wild animals. In 1832 Flinders Island was chosen for the Black settlement. The
island is about 130 miles in circumference, mountainous and rocky, and in the lower
parts covered with scrub.
Eobinson proceeded rapidly with his conciliatory course of treatment. He
went round the coast and succeeded in capturing the celebrated chief, Lemima
Beginna, who afterwards, in 1831, travelled with Eobinson through the country, and
by his behaviour won the confidence of the chief of the Stony Creek tribe. About
this time a tragedy occurred at Port Sorrell, resulting in the death of Captain B. B.
Thomas, a gentleman of the most kindly disposition. Mr. Eobinson took steps to
trace those who had perpetrated the crime, and found them at the Barn Bluff Moun-
tains. By the means of coolly walking up to the blacks, who drew near in a large
body, and shaking hands with the chiefs, he succeeded in capturing these formidable
warriors, known as the Big Eiver and Oyster Bay tribes. He did not relax his
labours, since we find him on 11th February, 1832, starting off to inspect Flinders
Island, and subsequently recommended that place as the future home of the
aborigines. On 12th July, 1832, the Protector] reported taking thirty-two men of fine
muscular build in the neighbourhood of Macquaire Harbour, In September of the
same year a band of warlike natives was encountered by him near the mouth of the
Arthur Eiver, where a dreadful night of suspense was spent by him and his party.
At the earliest dawn fresh trouble awaited him, for after having put on his raiment,
he rose up and stood in the midst of the wild natives who were having a discussion*
He had scarcely spoken ere the war-whoop was shouted, and spears were raised.
Suffice it to say that Mr. Eobinson’s behaviour was that of a Christian and a gentleman,
and it is a pleasing sentiment to feel that we are able to close this brief account of his
career in such a commendatory manner.


CHAPTER 11.
SIR JOHN FRANKLIN’S ADMINISTRATION.
1836-184:3.
SHE appointment of Sir John Franklin, Captain in the Royal Navy, and
Knight of the Guelphic Order of Hanover, as Lieutenant-Governor of Van
Diemen’s Land, was announced by Sir George Grey in the House of
Commons, 13th April, 1886. He was presented to the King by Lord Glenelg on
the 20th August, and embarked in the “ Fairlie ” on the 27th. He was accompanied
by Captain Maconochie, Secretary of the Geographical Society, who acted as his
private secretary, and one of the professors of the London University, and by the
Rev. William Hutchins, who had been appointed the first archdeacon of the colony.
Sir John assumed the reins of government 6th January, 1887, as fifth Lieutenant-
Governor of the island. His nomination was very acceptable to the colony. His
profession, his career and character were considered auspicious. He was the
companion of the illustrious Flinders on his voyage of discovery, and witnessed at
Sydney the departure of the first party from that port to colonise the island.
Franklin was born at Spilsby, Lancashire, 16th April, 1786. He had been intended
for the Church; but, as he had a strong predilection for the sea, his father did not
oppose him in his choice of a profession, and in 1800 he received a midshipman’s post
on board the “ Polyphemus,” the ship which led the van in the following year in the
Battle of Copenhagen. Two months later he was transferred to the “ Investigator,”
then fitting out under command of Captain Flinders for the exploration of the
Australian coast. On his return to England from Australia he was transferred to
the “ Bellerophon,” and served in this vessel as signal midshipman in the Battle of
Trafalgar (1805.) In 1814 he distinguished himself in the Battle of New Orleans,
and in 1819 he commenced a series of explorations in the Arctic Sea, in which he
was engaged till 1827, when he was created a knight, the University of Oxford at
the same time conferring on him the distinguished degree of D.C.L., while their
gold medal was awarded him by the French Geographical Society.
Previous to these honours being conferred on him, he received a post-
captaincy and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He afterwards engaged
in the Greek war of liberation. His great nautical renown which he had obtained


during a service of thirty-four years made his name familiar to, and in many
instances a household word with, the colonists. Hundreds of them had read the
history of his voyages of discovery, and they were therefore in a great measure
conversant with the character, brilliancy, intrepidity, and withal the meekness of
their new Governor. The enthusiasm of the people at the appointment of such a
mighty man to administer their affairs was beyond description, and one and all had
resolved that he should receive a welcome to their island home in accordance with
his exalted position on the roll of fame. Of course those who hailed with delight
the departure of the late Governor were especially demonstrative ; but the draught
which Sir John administered to them shortly after his arrival cooled their heated
brains, for he caused them to see that he was not a sympathiser with faction.
Crowds followed him on his arrival with acclamations; addresses of a most
eulogistic and hopeful character poured in on him from every portion of the colony.
The progress of Sir John through the colony exceeded anything ever witnessed in
Van Diemen’s Land previously. On his entry into Launceston he was escorted by
three hundred horsemen and seventy carriages. The streets were thronged; the
windows were crowded with fair spectators, who were equally enthusiastic. Being
a man of deeply reflective turn of mind, he could not avoid being oppressed and
delighted with these outward signs of joy. In his replies he frequently reminded
the colonists that although desirous of gaining their favour, yet the duties of his
station would probably compel him to disappoint their desires, and that he was
determined to “ see with his own eyes, hear with his own ears, and judge with his
own judgment.” Lord Glenelg, in his reply to Sir John Franklin’s despatch, which
contained a glowing description of his tour, and in which he depicted with words of
astonishment the healthy condition of the settlers, and their earnest desire to obtain
additional religious and educational advantages, stated that the report confirmed
the estimate he held of Franklin’s predecessor. In his first minute to the
Legislative Council, Franklin eulogised Arthur’s services, and laid on the table a
despatch of the Secretary of State breathing similar sentiments. It is not difficult to
see that, whilst the admirers of Arthur would feel gratified by such tributes of praise,
Franklin ran a certain amount of risk, as far as his popularity was concerned, by
thus openly avowing and exhibiting them. The Opposition dreaded the party of
Arthur, which was still powerful, and therefore the new Governor had a difficult
task to perform when he first entered on the government of a people whose past
animosities had lost little of their vigour. His great difficulty lay in his efforts to
reconcile parties, and caused him much anxiety and regret, as he was a man of
kindly disposition. It was not easy for Franklin to suspend the system of Arthur,
which still was the ruling one, and introduce a different mode of general
administration to that which Arthur had created, or, more correctly speaking, made
out of the elements he encountered on his assumption of the reins of government.


Captain John Montagu had been recently confirmed as Colonial Secretary, and
Captain Matthew E. Forster was the chief police magistrate. Both these gentle-
men, be it remembered, were nephews of Arthur, and most details of government
were necessarily transacted in their offices, and they exercised a considerable
amount of local influence, more especially Captain Montagu. It was no easy
matter, therefore, for Franklin to disregard their advice, and he was severely
censured when the Press claimed to have discovered that he was merely the tool
of Arthur’s faction. Reforms which Franklin considered necessary were difficult
to accomplish, and the difficulty was increased by the want of means to arrive at a
right decision as to where abuses really did exist, owing to the conflicting reports
of officials and settlers. A design was commonly imputed to the advisers of
Franklin to render him unpopular, and thus cause the late ruler to be regretted.
The Governor’s duties were new to him, and it is not a matter of surprise that they
would be very onerous, since his tastes ran in a direction totally different to
that of quelling the discordant elements of party strife. He was, however,
respected by all, and his devoted and talented wife cheered him on in the path of
duty. The greatness of this man, in his reply to an address from Richmond,
deploring the absence, and begging for the restoration of social peace, is fully
illustrated. His reply was as follows : “ With my whole heart I agree with you.
Let us be divided then, if we cannot be united in political sentiments, yet knit
together as friends and neighbours in everything beside. Let us differ where
honest men may differ; and let us agree not in undervaluing the points of political
dissent, but in respecting the motives which may produce it; in cherishing domestic
virtues, which will be found to characterise individuals of every party, and in
making the generous sacrifice of private feelings for the general good, rather than
aggravating the importance of grievances which must render such forbearance
impossible.” Such sentiments as these could only spring from the breast of one who
was at the same time humane, generous, liberal-minded and eminent in statesmanship.
This account of Franklin’s administration of the affairs of the colony is not to be
regarded as a vindication of his policy, but as an explanation of how he managed to
save his ship, in meeting with many icebergs, from being wrecked. He endeavoured
to promote the harmony of parties—that was his constant aim—by adding to the
list of magistrates ; and the very fact that persons discountenanced by Arthur were
placed on a level with their late antagonists, must prove that Franklin was one not
to be led by fear or favour. Here again he was beset with difficulties, since every
settler, by his wealth and pretensions, considered himself eligible for the position •
and consequently when the list was issued, it met with the reception of mockery
and laughter. In order to carry out his measures of conciliation, Franklin
nominated to his council Mr. W. E. Lawrence, a gentleman of wealth and intel-
ligence, and one who was most liberally minded. Sir John doubtless saw that it


was only owing to an early disagreement with his predecessor, and one which
caused frequent irritation, that Mr. Lawrence was naturally excluded from a
station he was so well qualified to hold. The Government was disquieted by
internal discord. A quarrel had taken place in open court between Judge Montagu
and the Attorney-General, which appears arose out of Mr. Stephen eating sand-
wiches in the Judge’s presence, and delaying a trial. The Attorney-General
resigned his appointment, and shortly after, as a judge, obtained the object of
professional ambition. Mr. Stephen, whilst Law Officer of the Crown, is said to
have exhibited great skill. He experienced considerable opposition to his drafts ;
but he always had the urbanity to offer an explanation of the principles embodied-
in his measures whenever they were seriously questioned. Before removing from
the colony, Mr. Alfred Stephen promoted a petition to the Crown, praying that
British institutions be granted the colonists. It was almost universally signed
(June, 1838,) but it met the fate of all those preceding it. One great misfortune
that befel Sir John Franklin was that Captain Maconochie, who was not only his
old friend, but also the person whom he had singled out for private secretary, held
opinions regarding convict discipline totally averse to every colonial party.
As prison discipline is very far removed from the most ordinary and common-
place intellectual subject, and as it is highly distasteful to writers to discuss such
subjects, and to readers to become acquainted with such discussions, we must
forbear entering into the details of such a revolting theme. Suffice it to say that
when it was known that Captain Maconochie was appointed private secretary to
Sir John Franklin, he was requested by some philanthropists in England to observe
the convict system of the colony, and to make a full report of his conclusions as to
the effects it produced on the moral and social welfare of the community. Captain
Maconochie asked the permission of the Secretary for the Colonies, Sir George
Grey, to perform this commission. The stipulations of Sir George Grey in granting
him permission to do so, were that all papers bearing on the subject should be
transmitted through the Governor to the Colonial Office. Voluminous reports on
the subject had been prepared by Maconochie, not many months after his arrival in
the colony, and these were forwarded by the Governor, who, no doubt placing
implicit confidence in his friend, did not take the precaution to peruse them. Their
contents, however, became known through publications in England. Great indigna-
tion was aroused in the colony at his representation of the condition of the convicts,
and his opinions on penal discipline were opposed to the views of the majority.
His dismissal from office, painful as it was to the Governor, was by Sir John deemed
necessary, who did not allow his sense of duty, however, to interfere with his
feelings of friendship, which were undisturbed. It was rather unfortunate that
Franklin should thus be left without the official, who might have greatly facilitated
his affairs. One very bold attempt was made by the new Governor to effect a


reform hitherto much disregarded by those in power. Many efforts had been made
to obtain admission for the public during the sittings of the Legislature. The
members had long been released from the oath of secrecy, and their votes, and even
the substance of their speeches, were occasionally known, notwithstanding that the
proceedings of the nominee Council during Arthur’s administration had been
conducted with closed doors. Franklin determined to throw open the doors of the
Council chamber, and on the first session which he opened he announced that the
public should be admitted to hear the debates, expressing his conviction that the
freedom of public discussion founded on accurate knowledge would be highly
advantageous to the passing of salutary measures. The doors were accordingly
thrown open, and this popular act was duly appreciated by the people and the
Press, the latter publishing reports of the proceedings of the Council. Although at
times Sir John Franklin failed in his praiseworthy efforts to promote the harmony
of parties, yet by means of his conciliatory measures in every direction, a great
improvement, socially and politically, began to be observable. The general prosperity
of the colony, and the large accessions of population, also contributed to promote
more friendly feelings. In 1838 the population was 45,764, thus showing an
increase in ten years of over 27,500. The Customs revenue was augmented to over
£70,000, the Imperial expenditure was over £150,000, and the value of the coin in
the banks was £104,720. During the decade 310,000 acres of land had been sold—in
other words there had been 60,000 acres sold during the first two years of Franklin’s
administration, whilst over 100,000 acres were under cultivation, or an increase
of 10,000 acres during the same period. There were nearly a million and a quarter
of sheep in the colony, notwithstanding the large exports to Port Phillip and South
Australia. The exports of wool and whale oil during the year 1838 were valued
at £172,000 and £137,000 respectively. The Government schools, which now
numbered 34, were attended by 1380 scholars, the latter showing an increase since
the year 1836 of 200. The Governor was very much interested in promoting
schools. Up to 1838 the public schools were exclusively Episcopalian, with Mr.
Peter Archer Mulgrave, formerly Chairman of Quarter Sessions, as Superintendent;
but that position was really given to Mr. Bedford, the senior chaplain. In 1838 the
British and foreign system, which provided for the union of all sects, was adopted.
A board of superintendents was appointed by the Crown, and masters were sent from
England by Lord John Russell at the cost of the colony. Colonel Snodgrass (the
senior military officer,) who administered the affairs of the colony for about three
months after Arthur’s departure, it is said, bequeathed to the new Governor the
adjustment of difficulties in a department which has ever puzzled the administrative
powers of civil government —the ecclesiastical. Colonel Snodgrass, while acting
Lieutenant-Governor, was induced to convene a Synod of Presbyterian ministers and
elders to discuss the best means of placing their Church on a proper basis. There


were disputes. Franklin found the relations of the Churches unsettled. Among
his earliest measures was one to define the objects and fix the amount of actual pay.
The chaplains appointed by the Crown had been always clergy of the Anglican
Church; but it having been found impossible to obtain qualified clergymen of
that Church in sufficient numbers to attend to the spiritual wants of the population,
the Government employed those of other denominations, chiefly the Wesleyans, as
spiritual instructors, sometimes with the express sanction of the chaplains. In the
country, catechists were appointed with the concurrence of Archdeacon Scott,
although in many instances members of dissenting communions. At this time the
doctrinal views of all the denominations were generally speaking in harmony. The
general import of the Articles of the Church of England, the Standards of the Church
of Scotland, and the Declaration of the Congregationalists were similar. The
Wesleyans, together with the Society of Friends, differed somewhat as to these
views; but notwithstanding the differences existing, all parties in their ordinary
teaching used the same theological and devotional terms. Their views of Church
government and of rites and ceremonies were the principal points on which they
disagreed. Unless as temporary agents to instruct prisoners, the Government
excluded all, save the Anglican clergy, from the patronage of the Crown. The
emigration of respectable families from Scotland brought about an important change
in ecclesiastical affairs. They are reported to have constituted a large section of the
free settlers in the country districts, and since the status of the various denominations
had not been hitherto clearly defined, the claim of each being regulated chiefly by
the Governor, much discontent was created thereby amongst all the settlers,
especially the Scotch, who held fast to that form of Christianity to which they were
accustomed in North Britain. Some asserted that the Governor could not exercise
such a function as devolved on the Crown in Scotland.
Others declared that the Governor, as representative of the Crown, was
bound to recognise the Church of Scotland as well as the Church of England. The
theory of Archdeacon Hutchins, that the transference of the local recognition in
Scotland to other parts of the Empire was as unreasonable as that of Cornishmen
claiming a right to carry their customs with them, is calculated to provoke a smile.
It certainly does not indicate the power to distinguish between social customs and
spiritual sentiments. The Rev. Dr. Lillie championed the cause of the Church of
Scotland with equal firmness, both these gentlemen acting with courtesy throughout
the controversy. It may here be mentioned that the Rev. A. Macarthur was the first
Presbyterian clergyman. He arrived in Van Diemen’s Land in 1823. He received
a small stipend from the Treasury. St. Andrew’s Church was built with funds
from the same source, on conditions that a bond be given for repayment of the
money if demanded by the Secretary of State. An important event in the eccle-
siastical history of Australia occurred in the same year—the arrival of the Rev.


John Dunmore Lang, D.D., in New South Wales. He defended the rights of the
Presbyterians, and succeeded in securing to them certain concessions, and Lord
Bathurst ordered the Governor (Sir Thomas Brisbane) to pay him £3OO per annum as
a stipend. In July, 1832, the whole question was debated in the House of
Commons. Sir George Murray, then Secretary of State, opposed a system for the
Colonies which would exclude all bodies except the Anglican Church from State
support. Governor Bourke was in favour of subsidising the Anglican, Roman, and
Scotch Churches ; and Lord Glenelg, who was Secretary for the Colonies in 1835,
assented to the wisdom of such a step. Governor Arthur brought the matter before
his Legislative Council, which passed a resolution that the principle be adopted in
Van Diemen’s Land.
Matters were still in an unsettled condition. The discussions of many
points continued after Franklin’s arrival. When the Synod assembled he sent his
private secretary with a request for them to postpone action, at the same time
intimating that he would give their claims a friendly consideration. They, however,
elected a Moderator, whereupon Franklin issued a proclamation annulling that of
his predecessor, and the assembly was dispersed. This action of Sir John was
due to the fact of him having been advised that the proclamation of Snodgrass was
irregular. It was not affirmed by the Scotch that they possessed an inherent right
to the privileges of an establishment; both or neither was their motto. The colony,
they justly asserted, was not English or Scotch, but British. Franklin, however,
showed that he was not hostile to religious freedom or license. In November, 1837,
Franklin’s Council passed “ an Act to make provision for the support of certain
ministers of the Christian religion and to promote the erection of places of Divine
worship.” It authorised the Governor to grant (under certain conditions) £3OO
towards the erection of a minister’s dwelling, and £7OO towards the erection of a
place of worship. According to its provisions, ministers of the Anglican, Roman,
and Scotch Churches, whose congregations numbered 80 in the country, or 200 in
either of the two chief towns, were to receive a stipend of £2OO each. With the
exception of the Revs. Dr. Browne and R. R. Davies, the measure encountered the
opposition of all the Anglican clergy. Archdeacon Hutchins objected to the
principle of endowing the Roman Church ; and a petition, signed by all the Anglican
clergy (excepting the above two) was forwarded to the Council. Owing to the
difficulty of establishing the claims of each denomination on the basis of bond fide
membership, and the absence of a clear definition of other matters, it was found
necessary to amend the Act. The Council accordingly, in remodelling the measure,
vested a discretionary power with the Executive to assist Churches by an annual
vote proportionate to the circumstances of the colony, at the same time reserving
the equitable claims of the present incumbents. The Crown erected the Australian
Colonies into a see in the year 1836, with Dr. Broughton as the first Bishop. The


event was highly acceptable to the clergy and members of the Church of England,
and during his first visitation numerous addresses were presented to him, welcoming
him to Australian soil. Although in another portion of this volume several pages
have been devoted to Education, yet, as a historical narrative, this part would be
incomplete without some brief reference being made to this all important question,
which Sir John Franklin was laudably desirous to promote. He felt that
the time had arrived when means to provide for a higher education should be
obtained, and accordingly corresponded with a friend (the celebrated Dr. Arnold,
of Rugby,) on the subject. Dr. Arnold suggested a double chaplaincy, and a
religious education rather than a merely secular system, and recommended that the
head master should be permitted to take orders. The choice of Dr. Arnold fell upon
a former pupil, Mr. Philip Cell, of Cambridge University, for the “ great missionary
labour,” who was nominated principal. In 1840 the Legislative Council sanctioned
the establishment of a college, and the erection of buildings. The cost was
variously estimated from £12,000. The Queen’s School, intended to be afterwards
a preparatory institution, was first erected. The Government, by the advice of Mr.
Gell and the Archdeacon, selected New Norfolk as the college site. On the 6th
November, 1840, the foundation-stone of Christ’s College was laid with due ceremony
by Sir John Franklin, assisted by members of Council and heads of departments,
Captains Crozier and Ross, R.N. (then commanding an Antarctic expedition) being
present. In the words of Franklin, “ the college dedicated to our Saviour was
intended to train up Christian youth in the faith as well the learning of Christian
gentlemen.” The night following the ceremony thieves overturned the foundation-
stone and stole the inscription and the coins. The establishment did not prosper,
and came to an end under the government of Sir Eardley Wilmot a few years
afterwards. Such a calamity might have been well foreseen, as it was impossible
to keep up an expenditure of £IOOO per annum to educate twenty-three scholars,
chiefly the children of Government officers and wealthy merchants. A petition was
signed by great numbers requesting the erection of a school on a more comprehen-
sive basis. In reply (1846) to this memorial, Lord Stanley, the Secretary of State,
said that, when established, a proprietary school would receive from the Crown
whatever assistance the public resources might justify. Unable to establish a local
University, the inhabitants placed the British system within the reach of some of
their youth. From the general schools, exhibitions led to the Hutchins, the High
School, Horton College, and the Church Grammar School; and from these schools two
Tasmanian scholarships of £2OO a year, each tenable for four years, led to a British
University; while the Council of Education in Van Diemen’s Land conferred the
degree of Associate in Arts. With these few observations on education we refer
the reader to the articles on that subject in this work. Sir John Franklin was
very much perplexed during the first two years of his administration about the


condition of the finances. The revenue derived from Customs, although gradually
on the increase, was still found insufficient to meet the expenditure arising from the
growing wants of the Colony. The claims of the Churches on the Treasury helped
greatly to increase this expenditure ; and to increase the revenue it was resolved to
prohibit colonial distillation. Another reason given for this step was, it is alleged,
that the excise duties were in numerous instances evaded by the distillers. When
the Crown ceased to purchase wheat at a high fixed price, it was deemed unfair to
the farmer to restrict the local market for his produce. Duties were imposed, but
a discrimination was made between sugar and cereals, and between colonial and
imported grain—a distinction which afforded ample opportunity for evasion. The
distillers employed these articles at their pleasure, and paid the lowest duty.
Colonial spirits were sold as foreign, and from £SOOO to £7OOO were lost annually.
The Bill was opposed by Mr. W. E. Lawrence and other leaders of the
country party. The Government proposed to include in the Bill a provision for the
indemnity of the distillers, the amount to be awarded by a committee. The
question of compensation created much diversity of opinion in the Council. Chief
Justice Pedder opposed this proposition, and urged the principle that such claims
should be settled by a jury. Mr. Edward Macdowell, the Attorney-General, also
opposed the proposals of the Governor as embodied in the Bill, feeling that they
were unjust, and in this resolution he was fortified by the opinion of Mr. H. Jones,
the Solicitor-General, who denounced its principle in no unmeasured terms. Mr.
Macdowell, having resigned, Mr. Jones accepted his place, and voted for the Bill,
defending his conduct by stating that his opinion had been expressed in ignorance
of its details. Owing to this change of front, Mr. Jones, so great was the popular
indignation at his conduct, speedily resigned. The Secretary of State, on being
appealed to, said that it was the duty of a member of the Government to support
its measures, and that if his conscience would not permit him to do so, he was
expected to resign. Franklin had ultimately to abandon the objectionable clauses
of his Bill. The rights of the distillers were recognised by the Home Government,
and their unsettled claims, to the amount of £7431, were paid in 1843. A lengthy
Insolvent Law was passed in 1839. It freed an insolvent who took the benefit of
the Act from liability to imprisonment for debt, but it subjected to transportation
not exceeding seven years, “or imprisonment with or without hard labour ” for
three years, any insolvent impeding the operation of the law, or wilfully defrauding
his creditors. The year 1840 was one of marked prosperity, the new settlements
of South Australia and Port Phillip importing stock and produce from the island
in large quantities. The high price which agricultural produce realised—potatoes
selling at £2O per ton, wholesale—led many into agricultural pursuits. The fine
lands of Westbury and Deloraine were laid under tillage; the rich forests were
entered, and farming on an extensive scale began to be carried on, There was a


great scarcity of manual labour to carry on the work of clearing; and it was only
those who, toiling with their own hands, and employing their families in the same
manner, could undertake successfully the task of tilling with the hoe—no other imple-
ment could be used—the paddocks being strewn with the trunks of trees. It would
be impossible to write even a most imperfect history of Tasmania without alluding
occasionally to the effects that the convict system had upon the island. The most
difficult question, perhaps, with which the Home authorities had to deal, was the
disposal of convicts. New regulations were constantly issued regarding them. At
one time they were forced upon the settlers as servants; now they were withdrawn,
and assignment was abolished. Large gangs of men were employed all over the
country making roads, while free labour could, with the utmost difficulty, be
obtained, even at the current rate of wages, which was £1 per week and rations.
Norfolk Island was again turned into a prison, and Lord John Russell announced
that transportation to New South Wales would cease. There was an impression
existing at the time that it would be discontinued at an early date in Van Diemen’s
Land. Labour being scarce, and extensive land sales having occurred, Sir John
Franklin was induced to promote emigration from the mother country. A vessel
was despatched to Adelaide, where many were suffering severe distress. The New
Zealand emigrants were dissatisfied, and numbers found their way to Van Diemen’s
Land. Mr. Henry Dowling, of Launceston, was appointed by a number of
settlers as their emigration agent in England. Several families were sent out, and
the emigration commissioners chartered ships specially fitted up for emigrants.
Settlers were by these steps relieved of the inconvenience they experienced
through the suspension of the assignment system. Free labour caused the convict
element gradually to disappear from the country districts, the prisoners being taken
to perform useful public works. Another experiment in the convict system was
now made. For two or three years the emigrants were satisfied, and moderately
prosperous. Town property was rapidly subdivided, and on every side small brick
tenements were erected, or in course of erection. The British Government
resumed transportation on an extensive scale in 1841, and under a new probation
system, initiated by Lord John Russell, but extended by Lord Stanley, gangs of
convicts, varying from 200 to 500, were scattered throughout the island. But Lord
Stanley’s system of probation rapidly told on the workman’s condition, who aspired
to have a dwelling of his own. His property became so depreciated in value, that
it only brought one-fourth its actual cost; in Launceston especially was this the
case. All these events struck a death-blow to emigration.
During the four years ending 1844, 15,000 prisoners were sent to Van
Diemens Land, while the number of emigrants had dwindled down to one.
In addition to these evils, general distress pervaded all the colonies. The
high price of stock and of grain, instead of proving beneficial to the community


at large, led to the most extravagant speculation; moreover, the rate of interest
was enormous, credit was unlimited, and borrowed capital was recklessly invested
in purchasing land, while improved breeds of horses, sheep, and horned cattle
reached almost incredible prices. Many of the old settlers who were in prosperous
circumstances now became insolvent, and saw their property pass into the hands of
mortgagees. Others, through receiving a helping hand, escaped total ruin, and by
the reaction which subsequently set in, their families to-day occupy those homes.
Amongst those transported to Van Diemen’s Land for political offences, were the
Chartist leaders. An outbreak in connection with the great Chartist movement
took place at Newport, England, in 1839, which resulted in the death of ten persons,
and in many being wounded. Three of its leaders—Frost, Jones, and Williams—
were sentenced to death, but were, instead of undergoing capital punishment,
transported to Van Diemen’s Land. Having conducted themselves in a quiet and
respectable manner, they were pardoned in 1854. Frost, who was a gentleman of
position in England and a magistrate, resided for many years in the Sorrell district,
and died in the United States, whither he afterwards had gone. Jones had a
jeweller’s shop in Launceston, and Williams, who was a man of scientific attain-
ments, discovered the coal deposits at New Town in the south, and Tarleton in the
north, where he spent many years. Both died at Launceston, the latter in 1874.
If Sir John Franklin was courageous at sea, it may be said of Lady Franklin
that she was equally so on land. To become thoroughly conversant with the state
of the island, they frequently visited the several districts. Lady Franklin delighted
in wild exploits. She ascended the summit of Mount Wellington when the track
was wild and rugged, and performed many other journeys which would cause even
one of the stronger sex to hesitate before attempting. Much scientific knowledge
of Van Diemen’s Land was acquired during the administration of Governor Franklin.
Mr. John Gould, the ornithologist, visited the island and afterwards published his
works on the '• Birds of Australia.” They subsequently published a supplementary
volume, a work on the “ Mammals of Australia,” and a handbook to the “ Birds
of Australia.” James Backhouse and George Washington Walker, two eminent
travellers, spent two years in the colony during Governor Arthur’s administration,
and again visited the island when Sir John Franklin was Governor. They visited
(travelling mostly on foot) all parts of the island, holding religious services—they were
members of the Society of Friends—in the prisons and at the homes of the isolated
settlers. In December, 1839, the French warships, ‘ Zel6 ” and “Astrolabe” arrived
at Hobart Town, after a perilous voyage in the Antarctic regions, where they succeeded
in discovering the coast, which was named Terre Adele. The Antarctic discovery
ships “ Erebus ” and “ Terror,” commanded by Captains Ross and Crozier, touched
at Hobart Town in November, 1840. Dr. Joseph Dalton Hooker accompanied the
expedition as botanist, and subsequently returned to England with 5340 species


of plants. Under the title of “Botany of the Antarctic Voyage” six quarto
volumes were published, with profuse illustrations of these discoveries. The colony
at this period had also the honour of a visit from Count Strzelecki, a Polish
nobleman, who, on his return to Europe, published a “ Physical Description of New
South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land.” The endurance of Strzelecki is shown by
his having travelled 7000 miles on foot through the two colonies. He discovered
portions of Gippsland in company with the late Mr. James Macarthur, and explored
a great many parts of Van Diemen’s Land, amongst them the Asbestos Ranges,
where he found indications of gold and copper. The bays, rivers, and headlands
of the Van Diemen’s Land coast were also, at this time, undergoing examination
by Her Majesty’s survey ship, “ Beagle ” (Captain Stokes.) The colonial cutter
“ Vansittart ” was placed at his disposal, under command of Mr. Forsyth (mate of
the “Beagle.”) Sir James Ross established an Observatory at Hobart Town, and
left it in charge of Lieutenant Kay, of the “ Terror.” It was fitted with the best
instruments usually to be found in observatories, and Sir John Franklin gave the
institution the benefit of his personal experience and co-operation. Thus the
colony, during his administration, advanced not only socially, commercially and
intellectually, but also much general scientific knowledge was acquired. The last
three years of Sir John Franklin’s administration were chiefly employed in arranging
the details of the convict system, afterwards expanded by Lord Stanley to
gigantic proportions ; for this task he was ill-suited by disposition or capacity. He
informed Lord John Russell in 1841 that he had appointed Captain Forster as
director of the probation system, and he transmitted standing orders for the
regulation of the new department, devised by that gentleman and sanctioned by
-the Governor and Council. The most painful event of Sir John Franklin’s political
career sprung from a disagreement with Arthur’s nephews, and especially with
Mr. Montagu, the Colonial Secretary. This gentleman had been in office for
many years, and was of a most imperious nature. During Franklin’s administration
Montagu’s dictatorial tone irritated the Governor—Government officers had been
dismissed by the Colonial Secretary, the Governor being unable to discover the
reason for such actions.
The reinstalment of one of these officers by Franklin gave offence to
Montagu, which he displayed by becoming insulting in his official intercourse, and
openly charged the Governor with being influenced by Lady Franklin, whereupon
Montagu was dismissed from office. The Governor, in his despatch to Lord Stanley,
acknowledged Montagu’s past services, and had the magnanimity to recommend
his appointment elsewhere. Montagu attended in person at Downing Street, and
told his version. Lord Stanley directed that his salary was to be paid from the
date of his dismissal. Franklin was censured by the Secretary of State for this
act, which led to his recall from the government of the colony. Sir John Franklin,


owing to his natural disposition, and his previous training, was not fitted for
governing a colony in a transitive state such as obtained during his administration
in Van Diemen’s Land. He was a man of the most disinterested character,
humble and scrupulous, frank and generous. Whilst these eminent virtues gained
for him the hearts of the people, they nevertheless disqualified him for coping,
successfully, with the many obstacles which beset his path. It cannot be
considered Cabinet etiquette to withhold any official announcement of a Governor’s
recall except through the arrival of his successor; but such was the case with
Franklin, who experienced such an abrupt termination to his tenure of office. He
retired from the government of the colony on 21st August, 1843. On his return
to England, an Arctic expedition was fitted out, and he sailed in May, 1845, with
the “ Erebus ” and “ Terror,” Captains Crozier and Fitzjames, to discover the
North-west Passage. The last time the vessels were seen was in July of the same
year. Records were found by Captain McClintock, R.N., in the yacht “ Fox,” in
1859, proving that the ships had been abandoned in 1848, and that Franklin had
died on 11th June, 1847. During eleven years every effort was made by the
British Government and Lady Franklin for the relief or discovery of the ill-fated
expedition. Tasmania subscribed £I6OO, and altogether about a million sterling
was spent in the attempt to discover the missing ships. The exertions of the
devoted Lady Franklin to rouse and prolong the search excited the sympathy and
admiration of nations, and more especially of one woman who also proved a
devoted wife, the then young Empress Eugenie. The bronze statue erected to
hranklin stands on the spot where he resided at old Government House, Hobart
Town, which is now called Franklin Square.


CHAPTER 111.
THE SIXTH GOVERNOR OF TASMANIA,
1843-1847.
SIR JOHN EARDLEY EARDLEY-WILMOT, Bart., succeeded Sir John
Franklin on 21st August, 1843, and administered the government for the
term of three years and two months. He represented Warwickshire
during several Parliaments, and for twenty years occupied the chair at the Quarter
Sessions held in that county. He was an abolitionist of negro slavery, and initiated
a bill for the summary trial of juvenile offenders. When prison discipline was
engaging so much attention in Great Britain, he contributed papers on the subject,
and accordingly Lord Stanley sent him to Van Diemen’s Land, where he could have
free scope for showing his ability in governing bond as well as free. He was
warmly received; but, unfortunately, the reprieve of a bushranger who had fired
at a settler whose house was attacked, but whom he did not succeed in killing,
caused the friends of the sentencing judge to become irritated, inasmuch as the
judge had declared the convict to be a man of the most desperate character. The
judge himself, to show his disapproval of this act of Wilmot’s, directed the sentence
of death to be merely recorded in a subsequent case, seeing that the recent reprieve
was virtually an abolition of capital punishment. Armed marauders, thus freed from
apprehension of death, created such an alarm amongst the inhabitants that a voluntary
corps was organised for self-protection; but the Governor refused to sanction the
movement, since the levying of armed men was the prerogative of the Queen.
He came to the colony when it was exceptionally difficult to legislate on the
questions uppermost in the minds of the people. There was a growing impatience
on the part of the free population for the management of their own affairs, and this
impatience was heightened by the difficulty of controlling the criminals concerning
whose management rapid and abrupt changes were resorted to by the Colonial Office.
To understand the enormous obstacles which Sir Eardley Wilmot had to face, it
would be necessary for one to have experienced what they were. He had to
govern a free population in a manner satisfactory to the colonial public and himself,
and he also had to carry out his instructions in penal matters. Charged with such
a gigantic mission, little surprise can be felt as to his failure. He regarded the
opposition of the colony to his measures as disrespectful to himself, and his

resentment caused a long and useful public life to close in sadness. The public was
attracted by his open and affable address, but owing to various acts he rapidly sank
in the estimation of the population. At a meeting of the Midland Agricultural
Association, Wilmot noticed the reflections passed upon him by Judge Montagu
with reference to his reprieve of Kavanagh, and said that he would never inflict
death in consideration of offences not on the records of the Court, and that in
Kavanagh’s case a robbery had only been proved. It has been already stated
that Norfolk Island was resumed by the British Government as the place for
sending the doubly convicted felons of New South Wales. In 1840 some of these
were removed, when numbers of a better class of prisoners were sent direct from
Great Britain to Norfolk Island, over whom Captain Maconochie was appointed
Commandant, so as to give his theories on prison discipline, a fair trial. Captain
Maconochie, it will be remembered, was dismissed from office by Sir John Franklin
for having passed criticisms on this subject. His leading feature was to reign by
kindness, and not to rule by fear. When he arrived at Norfolk Island he caused
the permanent gallows to be taken down, the use of the lash to be abolished, and
the gaols to be thrown open. Marks of good conduct would obtain the prisoners
their freedom, which would be lost for bad. He also catered for the gratification
and amusement of the convicts, an act which was considered at the time to be
fraught with mischief. The system adopted by Maconochie during his administra-
tion, which lasted for four years, is said to have led to the reformation of some; but
owing to the unfavourable reports received in England, the authorities once more
changed the mode of treatment, and decided on a new plan of operations.
The mild system was, however, on the whole a failure, as there is an inherent
principle in the nature of this class that no human device could possibly eradicate,
much less restrain; and it was found, before Captain Maconochie ceased to act as
Commandant, that cases of insubordination, and other equally vicious features,
began to develop. Norfolk Island, after Maconochie’s removal, became the
receptacle for the worst class of felons, and was made by Act of Parliament a
dependency of Van Diemen’s Land, whither all whom the Commandant could recom-
mend were sent, while prisoners sentenced for life, or fifteen years, were transferred
from thence to Norfolk Island. Major Childs, who succeeded Maconochie,
resorted to the old modes of punishment for crimes. There were 2000 prisoners
on the island in 1845, and the place was anything but one which would be
regarded as a desirable spot at which to dwell. In August, 1845, Major Childs
was succeeded by Mr. John Price, formerly Police Magistrate at Hobart Town, a
man capable, determined, fearless, and strong in mind and body. He commenced
his rule on the principle that " He who drives fat oxen, must himself be fat,” and,
consequently, to submit to any arbitrary conduct on the part of the convicts he
was not either prepared or disposed. He has been called the determined Price j


but when it is taken into consideration that he had 950 convicts on the island,
the majority of them being of the most depraved class, it would be necessary to
resort to extreme measures. There is no doubt that he did, at times, have recourse
to punishment of a severe nature, but he was driven to it, “as the state of the
island is said to have been indescribable . . . there was no rule or discipline ;
anarchy reigned supreme.”* After having restored order at Norfolk Island, he was
lost from the services of Van Diemen’s Land in 1853. Having been invited to
take charge of the penitentiaries at Melbourne, he for several years maintained
order in them, but at last fell a victim to the ferocity of those over whom he was
placed. Having occasion to visit a gang of those men who were working on the
tongue of land afterwards formed into a jetty at Williamstown, he was brutally
assaulted and crushed with masses of rock and stones
Previous to noticing what is known as the “ Probation System,” attention
must be directed to Lord Stanley’s Constitution Act, which dealt with the
constitutions of New South Wales, Van Diemen’s Land, and South Australia. An
Act for the Government of New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land (5 and 6
Viet, cap. 76,) was transmitted with a despatch, dated sth September, 1842 Both
Houses of Parliament had passed it, the existing Legislature in New South Wales
being empowered to arrange the electoral districts, and fix the number of members
for each district. Twenty-four were to be elected by the inhabitants, and twelve
were to be appointed by the Crown, thus making the total number thirty-six. At
the same time power was given to the new body to alter the numbers, but the
proportions of elected and nominated members were still to be maintained. The
Port Phillip district was to return five members, and Melbourne was to have one.
The irritating question as to emancipists, according to the 6th clause, disqualified
an attainted or convicted person, unless he had received “ a free pardon, or one
conditional on not leaving the colony,” or had undergone the sentence'adjudged.
The property qualification for an elected member was £2OOO, or £IOO a year.
Amongst other items of expenditure, it may be mentioned that the sum of £30,000
was placed on the Civil List for public worship. It is not necessary to refer to the
remaining clauses, of which the most important were the 41st, 47th, and 49th
clauses. To return to what concerns the history of Tasmania more particularly,
Van Diemen’s Land was fixed upon as the colony for convicts. The probation
system was now (1844) in active operation over the island, and gangs of probationers
were to be met with in all directions.
Lord Stanley has been blamed for initiating the system of congregating
together such a mass of criminals. Captain Forster, the Comptroller-General
of Convicts, decried the system, the Governor also, in his despatches to Lord
Stanley, not hesitating to depict its ruinous effects. He represented the country as

inundated with unemployed prisoners ; that the public expense would be swollen in
staving off starvation, or in repressing crime, and that land—cleared, fenced, and
in cultivation, with houses and buildings—might be bought at the upset price of
waste land. In addition to all these hardships which the colonists had to undergo,
they were obliged to pay for the coercion of those criminals from all parts of the
British Empire who traversed the land with passes and tickets-of-leave. There
had been, hitherto, spent by the Home Government nearly £300,000 a year, an
outlay which was beneficial to the farmers, the merchants, and the community in
general, as the greater part of this sum went for rations. Lord Stanley objected to
this expenditure, and issued orders for the withdrawal of the gangs from the roads,
and engaging them in agriculture. These instructions were given with a view to
render the system self-supporting, and thereby effect a reduction in the expenses of
the Commissariat. For this purpose agricultural areas were selected, but the
majority of them were in the most unsuitable parts of the island, and the tillage
being conducted in a very imperfect manner, the crops turned out badly, and the
result proved the scheme to be a failure. On some of the farms, potatoes, peas,
beans, grass seeds, and various cereals were grown largely—the surplus, after the
wants of the gang were supplied, being sold in the market. The Government,
accoi dingly, became competitors with the farmers at a time when the colony was in
a most depressed state. Van Diemen’s Land was deeply in debt; the cost of the
maintenance of police and gaols represented £IOO,OOO, a sum which was rapidly
increasing, as the chief source of revenue at the time was cut off by the almost
entire cessation of land sales. In 1841, 79,140 acres of Crown lands were sold at
12s. per acre ; and in 1847, when the price was raised to £l, only 3701 acres were
purchased. This complicated state of affairs led the Governor into collision with the
colonists, and especially with the independent members of the Legislative Council.
Sir Eardley Wilmot thought it his duty to carry out to the letter the mandates of
the Home authorities. Hampered as he was, he could not relieve the financial
difficulties of the colony by any course but that of further taxation, and accordingly
a Bill was introduced raising the ad valorem duties upon tea, sugar, and foreign
goods from sto 15 per cent. The measure was opposed by Mr. T. G. Gregson,
who considered it unjust to tax the people for burdens caused by the convict
system; but the Bill was carried by the majority of the Council, as a necessary
expedient. The Committee of the Council appointed to consider the financial
position proposed that heavy license fees on various trades and callings should
be charged. A public meeting of the people, at which Mr. Anthony Fenn
Kemp presided, denounced the proposal. Wilmot gave way, and determined to
abandon this mode of increasing the revenue, and also to await the arrival of
despatches from Lord Stanley, in reply to remonstrances sent home, urging that the
expenses incurred for police purposes ought to be defrayed by the Crown. Lord


Stanley’s reply was to the effect that in emigrating to a penal settlement the
colonists had surrendered the privileges they might have justly claimed under other
circumstances, and that every colonist had an interest in the multiplication
of bills on the British Treasury. The Council, which had been suddenly
adjourned on the 2()th August, was again called together in October, when
Wilmot endeavoured once more to pass the Estimates, which were strongly
opposed by Mr. Gregson, Mr. Richard Dry and other members. The Governor,
harassed on all sides, lost his temper, and accused them of an attempt to
embarrass the Government, whereupon the non-official members at once quitted
the chamber, and thereby reduced the number below the legal quorum. Mr.
Gregson appeared at the table on the following day, and said that the absence
of the other members was caused through their being engaged in preparing a
protest to be presented on the morrow. Wilmot denounced as unconstitutional
and disloyal Gregson’s assertions that “no Bill should pass until the Home
Government paid the judicial, police, and gaol expenditure,’ and pronounced the
leaving of the chamber to be an act of discourtesy. The single non-official member
who sided with Wilmot was absent, and only the Governor’s casting vote gave him
any control. The opinion of Mr. Francis Smith, jun, then a private barrister,
having been requested upon the question as to whether a chairman could have
a deliberative as well as a casting vote in committee was given in the negative.
The Governor still persisted, and this course led to another count out, and then to
the resignation of six country members—Messrs. Charles Swanston, Michael
Fenton, Richard Dry, Thomas George Gregson, William Kermode, and John Kerr—
who were distinguished as “ The Patriotic Six.” Their action gained the applause
of the public, Mr. Dry being received on his return to his native town of
Launceston in a most demonstrative manner, whilst Mr. Gregson was presented
with two thousand guineas and a piece of plate bearing a suitable inscription.
The “ Six ” sent a letter to Lord Stanley in which they stated “ they were called
upon to vote an expenditure which the colony could not bear—to anticipate a
revenue higher than the Customs were likely to yield; that they were denied
information, although they were bound to deliberate ; that they were expected to
augment an alarming debt, and when crime was increasing to diminish police
protection ; that they were told by the Governor that he would carry the estimates
by his casting vote before they refused to pass or had examined them; that the
Governor claims power to borrow money (from the banks) and spend it without
legislative consent; and, finally, that discussion and inquiry were denounced as
factious, unconstitutional, and disloyal. Under these circumstances they resigned
their seats as the only open course, and submit their conduct to the judgment
of the Queen.” The Governor’s position was most difficult. He simply could do
nothing. His obedience to Imperial orders brought him into unpleasant conflict


with the colonists, and he would have been more than human if he could have acted
otherwise than he did, when placed in a dilemma scarcely paralleled in the history
of colonisation. Sir Eardley Wilmot had difficulty in filling the vacancies by new
appointments Having called the members together, he proposed a mode of provid-
ing for the settlement of outstanding accounts, and for the repayment of money
borrowed from the bank, by issuing debentures. The measure was opposed by
Messrs. Henry Reed and Henry Hopkins, two of the newly appointed members, who,
failing to defeat it, resigned their seats. At length the Home Government agreed to
pay the sum of <£24,000 per annum towards the maintenance of police and gaols on
conditions that the proceeds of the land fund should be surrendered to the Imperial
Treasury. This was regarded by the colonists as a most unsatisfactory settlement
of the question; but the land fund having fallen off very considerably under the
policy hitherto pursued, the colonists had the best of the bargain. The Australian
Colonies had been erected into an Episcopal See in 1836, when Dr. Broughton was
appointed Bishop. About the same time Dr. Bolding arrived at Sydney as Bishop
of the Roman Church. In the year following the death of Archdeacon Hutchins
(1842,) who was the resident head of the Anglican Church in Van Diemen’s Land,
the colony was constituted a separate diocese, and Dr. Francis Russell Nixon was
appointed as Bishop of Tasmania. The Bishop arrived in June, 1848. He found
that the colonial law did not uphold the powers assigned to him by his letters
patent, which declared his jurisdiction “spiritual and ecclesiastical throughout the
diocese, according to the ecclesiastical laws of England.” In his first charge to the
clergy he alluded to the matter, and stated that he would seek an amendment to
the colonial law by the establishment of a Consistorial Court. The Governor
refused to supply by legal enactment the means to enable the Bishop to exercise
the jurisdiction conferred by his letters patent. The various other denominations
resented the attempt to bring them under the jurisdiction of a Church to which
they were not allied. In reply to a petition sent to the Queen, they were assured
by the Secretary of State that the Bishop of the Anglican Church w T ould not
exercise powers affecting other Churches. The Bishop visited England for the
purpose of having the defects in his letters patent remedied, but his efforts were
unsuccessful, as his letters patent were revoked and fresh ones issued. These
confined his power more exclusively to his own Church. Sir Eardley Wilmot was
abruptly recalled from the government of Van Diemen’s Land in October, 1846, by
a despatch from Mr. Gladstone. This was a most base act, rendered even stiil
more so by a secret despatch which Mr. Gladstone sent on the same day. This
despatch intimated that, though Wilmot’s failure in a penal colony did not detract
from his official capacity, there were rumours about his private character which
might render his further employment impossible. The despatch did not specify any
of the rumours. Wilmot replied, on the spur of the moment, and demanded the


dates and circumstances connected with any charges against him, and also the
names of his accusers. Mr. Gladstone replied that the persons who mentioned
these rumours did not profess to support them on any statement of particulars, but
to found them on his notoriety as an immoral man, and he therefore refused to
give the names of his informants.
There had appeared in 1845, in the Naval and Military Gazette , an anonymous
paragraph from Melbourne, stating that Wilmot set a bad example, and that no
people of standing would enter his house, except on business. The statement was
promptly contradicted as soon as seen in the colony, though the contradiction had
not reached England when Mr. Gladstone wrote his despatch. The colonists of all
shades of political opinion now united to support Wilmot under the double blow he
had received. Even the Bishop of Tasmania, although not on very friendly terms
of intercourse with him, bore testimony in His Excellency’s favour. The Chief
Justice and 250 leading members of the community, in an address to him, repelled
the foul slander, while those who were the best judges of his personal character
exonerated him and fervently sympathised with him. Mr. Gladstone did not let
the grass grow under his feet with respect to Wilmot awaiting the arrival of his
successor, but immediately issued instructions to Superintendent Latrobe, of the
Port Phillip district, to proceed at once to Van Diemen’s Land, and assume the
administration of the government. Mr. Latrobe arrived at Launceston on 11th
October, and on the following day proceeded overland to Hobart Town. At
Government House the usual oaths of a Lieutenant-Governor were administered
to Mr. Latrobe by Colonel Cumberland, the Commanding Officer of the Forces.
Sir Eardley Wilmot retired into private life, intending to remain in the colony for
some time, but he died on 3rd February, 1847, eight days after the arrival of his
successor, Sir William Denison. The announcement of Sir Eardley Wilmot’s death,
and the circumstances connected with his retirement, aroused the sympathies of all
and the indignation of many. It was not the waste of physical power, nor the
cares and anxieties of a most thankless position in the public service, but it was the
wound inflicted by Mr. Gladstone, the unwarrantable charge and the unjust dismissal,
which shortened his days. He was buried on Wednesday, 7th February, with all the
honours the colony could bestow. The late Acting-Governor, Latrobe, His Excel-
lency Sir W. Denison, the members of the Executive and Legislative Councils, heads
of departments, military officers, ministers of various Churches, and all classes in the
community marched in the funeral procession. Archdeacon Marriott and the liev.
Dr. Bedford conducted the service at St. David’s, and the remains of the deceased
baronet were deposited in a vault near that of Governor Collins. For the blow
inflicted on his father, Major Henry Eardley Wilmot was, in a measure, compensated
by receiving addresses of condolence from every quarter, testifying to the honour
and respect which was held for the memory of the sixth Governor of Tasmania.


CHAPTER IY.
TWO ERAS IN THE HISTORY OF THE COLONY,
1 847-1 8 56.
§IR WILLIAM THOMAS DENISON, Knight, Captain of the Royal
Engineers, arrived at Hobart Town in the “ Windermere,” on 25th
January, 1847. He was son of the late John Denison, Esq., M.P., brother
of the late Viscount Ossington, who was for many years Speaker of the House of
Commons; of the late Bishop of Salisbury, and of the late Archdeacon Taunton.
Sir William Denison had been selected by Mr. Gladstone, but owing to the fall of
the Peel Ministry, it devolved upon another Secretary of State, Earl Grey, to issue
instructions to the new Governor. An able and resolute man, he had, in his
capacity as an engineer officer, controlled public works in the English dockyards;
and as prison labour was largely used in them, he was considered by Earl Grey to
be “ peculiarly fitted ” for the position of Governor of Van Diemen’s Land. Sir
William Denison took with him a few non-commissioned officers of the sappers and
miners and Royal Artillery to assist in carrying on public works. The arrival of
the new Governor cheered the colonists somewhat, inasmuch as they had learned
that His Excellency was charged with several important commissions calculated to
result eventually in a better system of government. Earl Grey, although having
come into conflict with the colonists by a phrase in a despatch dated sth February,
1847, on the question of the cessation of transportation, had the prudence to leave
some discretion to Sir William Denison with regard to the Legislative Council. The
restoration of the “ Patriotic Six ” to their seats in the Council was the first matter
to which he gave his attention.
The Governor summoned them, and their successors (appointed by Wilmot,)
and asked them to agree upon the names of six whom he might reappoint as his
Council. The dismissed members were not disposed to divide. The Governor
then conceived the plan of pronouncing Wilmot’s appointments void, on the ground
that they had not been duly made, but at the last moment a document was
discovered which proved the contrary. Sir William Denison therefore adjourned
the Legislative Council until Royal warrants were received from England. These
arrived some months afterwards, and the “ Patriotic Six ” were duly installed


under them in 1848. Earl Grey had also charged the Governor to report upon the
subject of au elective legislature for the colony on the principle which he proposed
adopting in all the Australian Colonies. The Governor’s report disapproved of
Van Diemen's Land enjoying free institutions. A later despatch of His Excellency
to Earl Grey, written on the receipt of a despatch intimating the intention of the
Home Government to provide a Bill for a representative Assembly for Van Diemen’s
Land, gives anything but a flattering account of the colonists. It breathed death
to democracy. “ There is an essentially democratic spirit,” writes the Governor,
“ which actuates the large mass of the community, and it is with a view to check
the development of this spirit, of preventing its coming into operation, that I would
suggest the formation of an upper chamber.” It can hardly be subject of surprise
that the opinions of the Governor, as declared in the despatch which was printed
as a Parliamentary paper by the order of the House of Commons, created great
indignation throughout the colony. The Governor had also been commissioned to
ascertain the views of the colonists on the subject of transportation. He, there-
fore, shortly after his arrival, sent circulars to all the magistrates in the island and
other leading men, requesting a reply to three questions concerning the desirability
of the cessation of transportation, or its continuance in reduced numbers, and
what alteration in the regulations respecting the hiring of pass-holders are desirable
with the object of rendering the labour of the convict of more benefit to his
employer, keeping in view, at the same time, the necessity of encouraging habits of
industry, steadiness, and regularity of conduct in the convicts.
The circular occasioned a great deal of controversy; in short, every other
topic, in the newspaper Press, in public and in private, was almost totally excluded.
The anti-transportationists convened meetings for the purpose of eliciting public
opinion and arriving at a decision as to what replies should be given to the
Governor’s queries. A meeting was held at Launceston on 3rd April, and an
influential committee formed to receive evidence, draw up a report, and submit it
at a general meeting to be held on 10th May. Resolutions passed at a monster
meeting held in the Cornwall Assembly room, Mr. James Cox in the chair, in
favour of the immediate abolition of transportation, were carried almost unani-
mously, there being only about six dissentients. At Hobart Town similar meetings
were held on 15th April and 6th May. The abolitionists had a decided majority,
but their opponents, numbering over 300, signed a protest against the manner in
which the campaign was conducted. They averred that their speakers were inter-
rupted, and that the question had been unfairly discussed. A petition, signed by
all the clergy of the Church of England but three, advocating abolition, was
forwarded to the Governor. The “ Colonists of Van Diemen’s Land,” the mechanics,
tradesmen, and others of Launceston; the mechanics of Hobart Town; the
" Inhabitants of Cornwall,” and the “ Parents and guardians of Van Diemen’s


Land,” forwarded petitions of a similar nature to His Excellency. Many respect
able colonists, owing to various considerations as to the advantage of allowing the
then existing system to remain in force, hesitated to utterly condemn transportation.
Owing to the diversity of opinion contained in the lengthy replies to the circular,
the Governor was unable to arrive at a decided judgment on the question, and
accordingly did what he considered the next best thing to do—he gave his own view,
which caused great offence to the abolitionists. He represented the case to the
Home authorities as one which demanded serious consideration, on the ground that
a sudden cessation would completely derange the affairs of the colony, and he unfor-
tunately advocated a continuation of the system, with certain modifications. This
was disastrous to the hopes of the great majority of the colonists, who now regarded
the Governor as an opponent of their wishes. In addition to the organisation of
societies throughout the colony, having for their object the abolition of transportation,
an agency was established in London for the purpose of advancing the cause, and the
office of Agent was accepted by Mr. John Alexander Jackson, who fulfilled his
mission with great ability.
While this agitation was still going on, Sir William Denison laid on the table
of the Executive Council a despatch from Earl Grey, dated sth February, intimating
that, subject to the approval of Parliament, it was determined to do away with the
system. In the House of Lords, on sth March, Earl Grey moved the second reading
of the Custody of Offenders’ Bill,” its object being to dispose of offenders otherwise
than by sending them to Van Diemen’s Land. His Lordship also stated that he
intended to move the second reading of the “ Prisons’ Bill,” and then informed the
House of the views and intentions of the Government, and in the course of his
speech strongly supported the necessity of abolishing transportation. He also
alluded to the advantages of Representative Government for Australia. A circular
was addressed from the Home Office to the visiting magistrates throughout England,
intimating that the suspension of the transportation of male convicts to Van
Diemen’s Land would necessitate provision being immediately made for the
confinement and employment in England of the greater portion of such offenders.
This welcome intelligence aroused a feeling of great joy among the majority of the
inhabitants of the island, and of deep gratitude to the Secretary of State. The
colonists, as will be seen, soon discovered that the promise was a sop, it may be
unintentionally, thrown to Cerberus; for Earl Grey subsequently exhibited a degree
of vacillation quite unaccountable, as he had held, for years, views strongly opposed
to transportation. On the 12th November, 1848, the “ Ratcliff” arrived from
Spithead, with 248 male prisoners on board. A deputation, consisting of Messrs.
Allport, Swanston, T. D. Chapman, Gamaliel Butler, H. Hopkins, Downing, Haller,
Robert Officer, W. Rout, W. Crooke, C. T. Smith, Best and Kissock, interviewed
the Governor at once. The deputation handed His Excellency a petition from the


magistrates, clergy, bankers and others residing in Hobart Town. To this he replied
that the evils complained of were exaggerated, and that he had not the power to
grant what was desired. Notwithstanding this declaration, the views of Sir W.
Denison, which were hitherto unfavourable to the total abolition of transportation,
had undergone a change, for in his despatch which reached Earl Grey on sth
February, 1848, he pointed out the impossibility or desirability of attempting to
carry out his suggestious contained in his despatch. No. 83. Denison’s advocacy
of the cessation of transportation intensified the feeling of indignation against Earl
Grey, who had committed such a breach of faith, since to him, no doubt, was due in
great part the intention of sending all the criminals of the empire to Van Diemen’s
Land. During 1849, twenty ships with convicts on board arrived at Hobart Town
from various parts of the British Empire, having on board 992 male convicts and 868
female. It is needless to recount at length the manner in which the abominable
system died a lingering death. An Anti-transportation League, which originated
with the Rev. John West, of Launceston, was organised, and ultimately extending
its operations to all the colonies, became a most powerful lever in the hands of the
abolitionists. The Launceston Association proceeded vigorously to work. It was
proposed to hold a conference of all the colonies in Melbourne. The Lev. John
West and Mr. W. P. Weston were chosen as delegates from Van Diemen’s Land.
The conference which was held at Melbourne in February, 1851, unani-
mously adopted “ The League and Solemn Engagements of the Australian Colonies.”
Provincial councils were appointed in each colony, and the general conference was
formed from delegates of these various bodies. Representatives were nominated
in London, and an executive board was appointed. The League was so thoroughly
organised, and so unanimously supported by the Australians, that although the
British Government might hesitate to accede to the wishes of the people, on the
ground of the difficulty of the disposal of the criminals, Van Diemen’s Land was
no longer a receptacle for them. The desperate efforts of the colonists and the
discovery of the Australian goldfields in 1851 rendered the system no longer possible.
The cessation of transportation to Van Diemen’s Land was formally
announced in 1853. Mr. Richard Dry requested the Governor to proclaim the
10th August a public holiday ; but Sir W. Denison declined to do so, on the plea
that it would enhance the antagonism of class against class, but nevertheless, the
holiday was generally observed. A formal Order in Council, on the 29th December,
1853, finally repealed all formal Orders constituting Van Diemen’s Land and
Norfolk Island penal settlements, and on the 9th April, 1854, the Australian Anti-
transportation League was dissolved. On Ist July, 1855, by Order in Council,
the Queen commanded that ‘ on and after the Ist day of January next the said
colony of Van Diemen’s Land and the territory thereto belonging, shall be called
and known by the name of Tasmania.”


Thus ends the history of: transportation—a subject so unsavoury that it has
been but briefly noticed ; and although the naming of the island as Tasmania carries
us beyond the date of the present chapter, yet it is deemed advisable to record it in
this place, so as to complete the current of events.
It will now be necessary to retrace our steps and consider other matters
connected with the history of the island. Owing to the inadequate powers of the
Council, many of their measures were worthless, according to the judgment of the
Supreme Court. Two of these enactments, passed in 1846, during Wilmot’s
administration, came into force in the following year, and caused great dissatisfac-
tion. One was the Differential Duties Act, and the other the Dog Act. The
former met with a strong opposition. The merchants and shipowners of Hobart
Town denounced the imposition by that Act of a duty of 15 per cent, on the
produce of New South Wales, South Australia, and New Zealand as impolitic, and
tending to destroy the trade carried on between Van Diemen’s Land and the other
Australian Colonies, and likely to introduce retaliatory measures. The duty was
paid under protest; the Legislative Council of New South Wales declared the Act
was unjust; it was disallowed by the Queen ; and all who had paid the duty had
it returned to them.
Ihe Dog Act came into operation at the same time, and led to the question
as to whether a nominee Council had the power to impose taxes. Some paid the tax
upon dogs, which varied from five to ten shillings, under protest, whilst others
refused on the grounds of its illegality. Mr. Morgan, editor of the Britannia
newspaper, was summoned for non-payment of the tax and fined. He appealed
fiist to the Quarter Sessions, and on the decision being there upheld, he brought his
case before the Supreme Court. The decision of the judges led to a conflict with
the Governor. Chief Justice Pedder gave his opinion that the Governor and Council
had not the power to levy any tax upon the inhabitants except for local purposes.
He came to the conclusion that the Act was not binding and must be annulled.
Mr. Justice Montagu agreed with the opinion of the Chief Justice, and upheld the
right of the Court to interfere, since every subject, according to the law of the
constitution, had the right to ask that Court for the redress of wrongs.
But Denison was not disposed to accept this view of the matter. Being
without a Legislative Council, as the Queen’s warrants for the reinstatement of the
“ Patriotic Six ” had not arrived, he resolved to act on the authority of the
Executive, and desired to have the judges removed. The other members of the
Executive were opposed to the dismissal of the judges, whereupon the Governor
suggested to the Chief Justice that he should ask for leave of absence, a course
which he declined. The case was brought under the notice of the Secretary of
State by the Governor, who, as Lady Denison said in her description of the result,
received in the despatch “an awful rap over the knuckles.” Happily for the


Governor, a circumstance intervened in Judge Montagu’s case which terminated the
dispute. He had been sued by a creditor for £2OO ; but as his office protected him
against a verdict of the Court, he was requested to resign, with the under-
standing that on the decision of the suit he would be reappointed. Refusing to do
this, he was dismissed, and Mr. Thomas Horne, the Attorney-General, succeeded
him. Montagu was regarded as a most impartial judge. He had a sound know-
ledge of law, was just in his decisions, but severely rebuked those whose conduct
merited it. In private life he was of a most retiring disposition. He spent money
in a most reckless manner, and was greatly addicted to boat-racing and yachting.
The other era in the history of the colony was the discovery of gold in
Australia. As early as 1849 gold was found in the vicinity of Mount Barker,
South Australia. Before the Californian discovery, traces of the metal were found
in New South Wales. At Camden a small piece of pure gold was picked up in
Mr Macarthur’s garden. A prisoner in the Government service at Port Arthur
offered to show a gold deposit in Van Diemen’s Land on condition that he should
be rewarded; but the Governor refused the proposal, as such a discovery would
prove detrimental to the interests of the colony, at least for some time. Rev. W. B.
Clarke had for a long time the belief that many parts of New South Wales were
auriferous. Count Strzelecki discovered gold in New South Wales in 1839. The
grand discovery of gold in New South Wales was made on 12th February, 1851,
by Edmund Hammond Hargreaves, an old colonist who had lately returned from
the Californian goldfields. In Victoria, the first discovery was at Strathlodden, in
July of the same year, Buninyong was the next place where gold was found, and
then Ballarat, the Jupiter of the Victorian system. Here the gold was lying on
the surface of the flat, and could be picked out in large nuggets with a penknife.
Van Diemen’s Land was affected by the accounts which continued to arrive there.
Wives and families, farms, all sorts of trades and occupations, were abandoned by
hundreds for the goldfields of New South Wales and Victoria. The census of
March, 1851, showed a population of 70,000, the males being 30,769. Between
the Ist and the 30th January, 1852, more than 10,000 rushed to Victoria. Sir W.
Denison apprehended that food would reach famine prices if farmers and their
labourers should, by going to the goldfields, lessen the production of grain, and
members of the Anti-transportation League feared that unless gold were found in
the island, the best labourers would desert it. The Governor thought that, even if
it should be found, convicts ought still “to be sent to the colony.” In June, 1852,
he wrote, in his charming work, “Varieties of Viceregal Life,” “The place is
becoming nearly depopulated ; one-third of the whole male population has already,
deserted, and more keep going every day.” The greater part returned home, many in
improved circumstances. The colonists were benefited in a larger degree by the
results which followed the discovery of gold rather than by migrating to the goldfields.


Although this chapter bears the title of “ Two Eras in the History of the
Colony,” yet two other occurrences took place, to each of which a separate chapter
might advantageously be devoted. One was the arrival during 1849 of the leaders of
the “ Young Ireland ” party in Van Diemen’s Land ; the other was the establishment
of a new Legislative Council, an event of the greatest importance to the island. The
latter will be noticed in the succeeding chapter, whilst to the former a brief notice
will be given in this place. The new party despised the wise counsels of Daniel
O’Connell, who was the leader of the “ Old Ireland ” party, and sought to redress
the wrongs of their country by physical force. They were men of strong feelings,
able to conspire, but lacking the discretion to carry out a conspiracy. William Smith
O’Brien, one of the leaders, was M.P. for Limerick, His honour and integrity in
public, his kindness and affection in private, his possession of extensive property,
and his descent from the heroic Irish king, Brian Boru, gave him great influence in
Ireland. He was beloved by the people for virtues, but shunned as a leader of
rebellion. Thomas Francis Meagher was the son of Thomas Meagher, Esq.,
Member of Parliament for Waterford. When Louis Philippe fled from France,
Meagher and O’Brien headed a deputation of Young Irelanders who waited on
Lamartine, then Minister of the young Republic, with a view to urge him to wage
war with England,—one glaring instance of their over-sanguine expectations.
John Mitchel was the son of a Presbyterian clergyman in the north of Ireland.
Dissatisfied with his position as bank clerk in Londonderry, he subsequently
resigned to join Mr. Fraser, a solicitor. He started the United Irishman news-
paper, in which he advocated the redress of wrongs by force. These men were
prosecuted for seditious conduct, and the juries by whom they were tried disagreeing
in their verdict, the Government passed a Bill which made all written incitement
to insurrection or resistance to the law felony, punishable with transportation.
Mitchel was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to fourteen years’ transportation,
put on board a man-of-war and sent to Bermuda, whence, after having served part
of his sentence on board the hulks, he was brought to Van Diemen’s Land in the
“ Neptune.” Mitchel was hardly disposed of when O’Brien, Meagher, and their con-
federates were arrested. In all, seven of the ringleaders were sent to Van Diemen’s
Land. O’Brien, Meagher, McManus, and O’Donohue arrived at Hobart Town on
27th October, 1849. Four days after, the brig “ Emma” arrived, having on board
John Martin and Kevin O’Dogherty, who had been sent to Sydney in a convict
ship. On their arrival they were offered tickets-of-leave under the usual condition,
to which all pledged themselves except Smith O’Brien, who was accordingly sent to
Maria Island to undergo his sentence in penal servitude. The others were required
to reside in separate districts. McManus was sent to Launceston, Meagher to
Campbell Town, Martin to Bothwell, O’Dogherty to New Norfolk, and O’Donohue
was allowed to remain in Hobart Town. Mitchel, on account of his delicate


health, after having accepted his ticket-of-leave, was sent to Both well, where his
friend Martin resided, the change causing him rapidly to regain strength. Smith
O’Brien remained at Maria Island, under close surveillance, for nearly a year,
and was subjected to such tyrannical treatment that his health gave way. Hie
surgeon of the station having reported unfavourably of his physical condition, he
was permitted to wander at large in custody of a keeper. The next step in
O’Brien’s career was his attempted escape and its failure. This caused the unfor-
tunate captive, who was now moved to Hobart Town, to undergo a treatment more
rigorous than ever, and being obliged to bow to circumstances, he accepted his
ticket-of-leave. In November of the same year (1850) he resided at Norfolk
Island, and after a time removed to the Fingal District, where he became tutor in
the family of Dr. Brock, subsequently returning to reside in his cottage at New
Norfolk. Meanwhile the other exiles tried to make the best of life. Meagher
married a young Tasmanian lady, daughter of Mr. Bennett, a resident in the
district of New Norfolk. Mitch el sent home for his wife and children. His wife
was the niece of the far-famed Sir W. Verner, Bart., M.P. for the county of
Armagh. McManus resided at Launceston ; O’Donohue was the proprietor of the
newspaper, the Irish Exile , published at Hobart Town ; and John Martin remained
with his friend Mitchel at Bothwell. McManus, Meagher, and Mitchel succeeded
in eventually effecting their escape at different periods. Martin resided in the
colony until he was pardoned, in 1854, when he went home. In the same year
Smith O’Brien received a conditional pardon, and in July, 1856, was permitted to
return to Ireland. Broken in health and spirits, he died in Wales, in June, 1864.


CHAPTER Y.
THE DAWN OF RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT.
1851-1856.
■WING to want of time one of the most important measures, “The Better
Government of the Australian Colonies,” was postponed for consideration
during the session of the British Parliament in the year 1849. This proved
a great source of disappointment to the colonists, who had fully hoped that when
the draft of the Bill had been circulated and published in the colonies, the session
would not close before it passed through the House of Commons. The amended
Bill of 1850, which became law, provided for the erection of Port Phillip into a
separate colony, to be named Victoria. Provision was also made for the establishment
of Legislative Councils in Van Diemen’s Land, Victoria, and South Australia, on
the same model as that of New South Wales —the Crown nominating one-third of
the members, and the people electing two-thirds. The legislative institutions of
Van Diemen’s Land, owing to many glaring defects, required some change to be
made. Those country members who formed a part of the Governor’s nominee
Council earnestly desired the advancement of the colony, but they were powerless,
as the Governor forced measures opposed to their views through the Legislature in
spite of their votes and protests. Again, the Government officials, who constituted
one half of the Council, were liable to instant dismissal from the service if they even
hinted at dissenting or withholding their support of measures proposed by the
Governor. The new Act provided that the existing Council should frame an
Electoral Act, fixing the boundaries of the electoral districts, and all necessary
details for the establishment of the new Council. The amendment of the
constitution of the Legislature by the formation of two Houses, or otherwise altering
the Act as the Council, whenever established, might deem desirable, subject,
however, to the assent of the Queen, was also authorised. In the case of a freehold
estate, the qualification for voting was that it be of £IOO in value, or yielding an
annual value of £lO. Leaseholders were entitled to vote by occupying a house or
land valued at £lO a year.
Sir William Denison having displayed much delay in bringing the new Act
into operation, and all the other colonies being before him in this duty, the colonists


became impatient, and held a public meeting on the question at Hobart Town A
committee was formed with instructions to elicit information as to the cause of
delay, and to learn from His Excellency when his Council would be summoned to
pass the Electoral Act. Eventually the Act was passed, and the Governor addressed
his Council for the last time on 2nd July. Writs were issued fur the election of
sixteen members to serve in the new Council, but were not returnable until the
beginning of November. The day of general nomination was remarkably brilliant.
The principal candidates were attended with numerous banners and long processions.
Ladies Wore the colours of their parties, and several hundred children marched in
Mr. Dry’s procession. Great excitement prevailed in consequence of a few
advocates of transportation announcing their intention to enter the lists. The
country districts were in three cases disputed by them, but they polled little more
than a hundred votes. In Hobart Town a more serious conflict was expected, since,
beside the lower classes of expirees, many of the publicans, and almost all in the
service of the Government, favoured transportation. Mr. Young, a solicitor,
after several candidates had retired, determined to enter on a contest in Hobart
Town with Messrs. Chapman and Dunn. Mr. Young polled over five hundred
votes, but the popular candidates carried the day, in the face of every obstacle —a
fact which demonstrated the irrevocable desire of the people for freedom. The
sixteen gentlemen chosen by the people at this, the first election in the colony,
were:
R. W. Nutt for Buckingham.
R. Dry „ Launceston.
J. W. Gleadon „ Cornwall.
Michael Fenton „ New Norfolk.
Askin Morison „ Sorrell.
T. G. Gregson „ Richmond.
R. Cleburne „ Huon.
R. Q. Kermode „ Campbell Town.
T. D. Chapman i
J. Dunn. jun. } for Hobart Town -
H. F. Anstey „ Oatlands.
Joseph Archer „ Longford.
James Cox „ Morven.
John Walker „ Brighton.
W. S. Sharland „ Cumberland.
W. Archer ~ Westbury.
The colonists were intensely gratified with such a satisfactory result, which
clearly indicated that they were about to be relieved of many of the shackles with
which they had been hitherto encumbered. Sir W. Denison, at this time,
proclaimed what were called the “ pre-emptive right ” land regulations. By this
overstepping of power large areas of the Crown lands fell into the hands of
speculators. The regulations provided that any lessee of Crown lands might select
for cultivation and future purchase any part of the lands leased to him. The
selection was to consist of not less than one hundred acres, and was allowed on
condition that thirty shillings per annum be paid for every hundred acres so selected
for ten years, when the sum of one pound per acre was to be paid for the land.
The prospective purchaser was permitted to have the selection and rental for


pastoral purposes, “ upon a tenure of ten years, ten times the area selected for
purchase, and he could secure the leased lands for another ten years if he occupied
his purchased lot as a homestead, and paid for it on the expiration of the first ten
years.”* No limit was at first decreed; the maximum area was afterwards fixed at
640 acres for purchase, and 5000 for rental—the maximum for purchase being again
reduced to 500 acres. This land law was eagerly taken advantage of by the large
sheep-owners, as they could secure the best lands adjoining their original grants,
which they could occupy for twenty years on very easy terms.
The pre-emptive right regulations led to a greater evil, for speculators
appropriated in a wholesale manner the agricultural forest lands in the County of
Dorset and along the north-east coast from the Rubicon to Emu Bay. Prior to
this date there were not more than twenty settlers inhabiting the districts bounded
by the waters of Bass Strait, but Denison’s new land regulations altered this
condition of affairs. Blocks of land, first of 640 acres, and when the area was
reduced, of 500 acres, were taken up at random, until the whole country to the
west side of Port Sorrell was alienated for a distance of about ten miles back from
the coast. Those who selected were allowed to complete their purchase at any
time within ten years, or in case of deferring payment for that period, were
required to make a small yearly payment. These land regulations had a most
injurious effect on the timber trade, which was growing to be one of importance.
The nominal alienation of all the Crown lands greatly impeded it, and the entire
suspension of bond Jide settlement which ensued was disastrous. Subsequent
settlement was very much retarded, since the whole country had been appropriated
by persons of a speculative turn of mind. Some of the lots taken proved unre-
munerative, and were abandoned; some were sold at a large profit; and others
were disposed of in various ways. The new Legislative Council was summoned to
assemble on 30th December, 1851. The initiation of the new system occasioned
two days to be spent in preliminaries. In addition to the sixteen elected members,
there were four official and four other members nominated by the Governor. The
official members were Messrs. Peter Gordon Fraser, Colonial Secretary; Adam
Turnbull, Colonial Treasurer; Valentine Fleming, Attorney-General; and Francis
Smith, Solicitor-General. The nominees were the Honourable Richard Gilbert
Talbot, of Malahide; and Messrs. Allison, Bisbee, and Leake. Mr. Dry was
unanimously elected Speaker. It must be borne in mind that the Legislature was
in a transition state : it had power to amend the constitution, which it afterwards
did. On New Years’ Day, 1852, the Governor read his opening speech to the new
Council, in which many matters of great importance to Tasmania were adverted
to; but the subject of transportation was not mentioned. Regret was expressed,
in the Council’s reply to the speech, that His Excellency had not touched upon the
# FentQQ.


question, and referred with regret to the continuance of the system. A warm
debate took place, the Government strongly objecting to the introduction of
irrelevant matter into the reply. Four times they divided the House, and on each
occasion were defeated. A majority of the Council adopted an address to the
Queen, pointing out the evils of the influence of criminals. The Governor, in
closing the session, alluded to it in such a manner as to arouse the indignation of
members. The only useful measures passed during the first session were the
“ Customs Duties Act” and the “ Cross and By-roads Act.” The latter Act was
shortly afterwards altered by substituting a rate on the annual value of property,
instead of deriving aid from Crown lands. The new “ Customs Duties Act ” pro-
vided a revenue from Customs under one simple tariff, the “ Differential Duties
Act ” being repealed. The second session of the Legislative Council was opened
by the Governor on the 15th June. The transportation question occasioned much
confusion. Members refused to pass the Estimates until they received a reply to
the petition forwarded to Her Majesty the Queen. They again addressed the
Queen, praying that the Order-in-Council making Van Diemen’s Land a place for
the transportation of criminals be rescinded. Only Mr, Attorney-General Fleming
and three nominees opposed it. Mr. H. S. Chapman and Dr. Turnbull were, for
their action in the matter, virtually dismissed by the Governor. They were, how-
ever, allowed leave of absence on half-pay until the decision of the Secretary of
State should arrive. In the case of the Solicitor-General there was a condition, if
he took office, that he should be allowed to exercise liberty of conscience on the
transportation question. A deputation waited on the Governor to request him to
forward the address to the Queen. This he promised to do, but at the same time
said that he apprehended the policy indicated in the petition would prove mis-
chievous ; in short, he entirely disapproved of the entire proceedings. This caused
increased irritation, and another long address to the Queen was proposed, declaring
a want of confidence in the Governor, and virtually asking for his recall. The
resolution was carried by a majority of four, after a very heated debate. Denison
had himself to blame, in great measure, for this hostile attitude, as he made the
question of transportation a personal matter. Denison was not to be convinced of
the folly of pursuing the course he had entered on. He addressed the Secretary
of State in such terms as really to cause any man to pause before attempting to
abolish transportation to Van Diemen’s Land.
Notwithstanding the feud existing between the Governor and the Council,
some useful measures were passed during the session of 1852. The “ Customs
Duties Act ” was somewhat altered, a bill was passed conferring municipal insti-
tutions upon Hobart Town and Launceston, and a Water Bill gave Launceston
certain powers. Elections of Aldermen took place on Ist January, 1853. Mr. W.
Carter was the first Mayor of Hobart Town, and Mr. W. S. Button had the same


distinction conferred upon him for Launceston, A " Post Office Act ” was also
passed. The sum of £12,500 was voted from the Land Fund for the purpose of
immigration, but the Home authorities disapproving of the plan of the Council, the
money was not spent. When the Duke of Newcastle became Secretary of State, on
the turnout of the Derby Government, he was able to announce that transportation
had absolutely ceased. The decision was, however, arrived at by his predecessor, Sir
John Pakington, who in his last despatch, dated 14th December, 1852, communi-
cated the fact to the Governor. The official notification appeared in the Hobart
Town Gazette of May, 1853.
Having previously dealt at length with the discovery of gold, it will be only
necessary to mention that the first payable gold found in Van Diemen’s Land was
obtained at the Nook, four miles from Fingal, in February, 1852; but the returns
were so small and the attraction of the Victorian goldfields so great that after some
time the place was left in the hands of a few, who did fairly well.
To return, a Bill to grant retiring pensions to judges of the Supreme Court
having been passed on 4th May, 1853, Chief Justice Pedder resigned on a pension
of £SOO a year, an emolument to which he was justly entitled for such a long,
useful, and faithful service. Sir John Pedder was succeeded by Mr. Valentine
Fleming, the Attorney-General, Mr. (subsequently Sir) Francis Smith receiving the
latter office.
The public revenue of the colony supported at this time certain denomina-
tions to the extent of £15,000 annually, as provided for in the “ Constitution Act.”
Further provision was made for the clergy by the passing of a “ Pensions Act,” in
1854, whereby ministers receiving stipends could retire on life annuities. The
measure was warmly opposed by many members of the Legislative Council, as
impolitic and illogical; but notwithstanding the opposition, the “ Pensions Act ”
became law. Owing to the prosperous condition of Victoria at this time, it was
difficult to obtain any class of workmen, and to obviate this condition of affairs the
Government endeavoured to encourage emigration to Tasmania; but the colonists
disapproved of the class sent out by the Emigration Commissioners appointed by
the Home Office. The colonists, therefore, formed themselves into societies for the
promotion of emigration; agents were appointed to proceed to England and Scot-
land and select the class required. By this means many immigrants of a superior
sort came to Tasmania. During the Parliamentary session of 1854 a Bill was passed
to increase the number of members of the Council from twenty-four to thirty-three,
six of the nine additional members to be elected by the people and three to be
nominated by the Governor. The measure did not give satisfaction to the elected
members generally, because a Constitution Bill was then before the Council. A draft
Bill had been prepared by a committee of the House, which was passed during the
session, and only awaited the Queen’s assent. Such being the case, it was


considered unwise to interfere with existing arrangements, which would be superseded
by the form of government under the new “ Constitution Act.” The year 1854
witnessed the close of Sir William Denison’s administration of the government of
Tasmania. When Sir William Denison arrived in Tasmania, in 1847, trade, com-
merce, and financial affairs were in a most depressed condition, and now that he
was about to give up the reins of government the island was in a most prosperous
condition. There was a million sterling in the banks, there was no public debt, the
land revenue for the year was £112,225, the exports amounted to one and a half
millions, and the imports to about two and a half millions. The population during
his period of office had decreased by over 3000, owing to the exodus for the
goldfields.
Sir William Denison left Tasmania on 18th January, 1855, to enter upon the
government of New South Wales. After remaining in that colony for six years,
he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Presidency of Madras. Returning
to England in 1866, he died 19th January, 1871, at the age of sixty-seven.


CHAPTER YI.
THE FIRST COLON! UNDER RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT.
1856.
SIR HENRY EDWARD FOX YOUNG entered upon tlie government of
Tasmania in January, 1855. He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir
Aretas Young, who had distinguished himself in the Peninsula. He was
born in 1810, at Bradbourne, near Lee, in Kent; was educated at Bromley School,
and entered as a student of the Inner Temple, but on his father going out to the
West Indies, he accompanied him, and began official life when quite young.
Returning to England in 1847, Mr. Young, for his great abilities as Government
Secretary of British Guiana, was knighted, and appointed Lieutenant-Governor
of the Eastern Districts of the Cape of Good Hope. In 1848 he was appointed
Governor of South Australia, and administered the affairs of that colony until
he received the Governorship of Tasmania. When Sir Henry Young began
his administration the colony was in a most prosperous condition; a large number
of immigrants had already arrived, and many more were on their way out. The
prosperity of the colony may be inferred from the fact that they had subscribed
and sent home the sum of £25,000 for the widows, orphans and other sufferers by
the Crimean War. Coal had been discovered in various places in Tasmania ; the
timber trade at the Huon and on the north coast had already grown to importance:
for the two years (1853 and 1854) the total value of timber exported was estimated
at £749,857. But a reaction was at hand: the coal deposits were of little value,
and the timber trade became comparatively worthless. Thus the fortunes of the
colony were, in a few years, reversed.
With the other colonies it was different, for they, by means of opening up
the land, and liberal land laws, as well as the continuation of mining, were able to
retain their rapidly increasing populations. All the different attractions and
inducements caused numbers of the population to leave Tasmania for other parts of
Australia.
Sir Henry Young summoned the Council to meet on the 17th July. The
six newly elected members under the “ Extension Act ” were Messrs. Adye Douglas,
Charles Meredith, T. W. Field, James A. Gibson, A. Perry, and Dr. W. Crooke.


The nominee members appointed under the same Act were Mr. T. J. Knight, Mr.
James Lord, and Mr. W. G. Elliston, the Mayor of Hobart Town. There were
also several new members, Mr. Dry, the Speaker, being amongst those who
resigned. Captain Fenton was chosen Speaker in room of Mr. Dry, who retired
in consequence of failing health. There was really nothing for the members to do
which could not have been better done under the new system of government, which
was only awaiting the Royal assent. But having assembled, they determined on
doing something. By a majority of eighteen to six, a Select Committee was
appointed to investigate the Convict Department. The Legislative Council had no
power to take such a step. Rumours had been spread about that Hampton, the
Comptroller-General, and others had derived profit from labour of prisoners,
through receiving articles made by them, and accordingly an inquiry was necessary.
The Committee summoned witnesses and interrogated them. Dr. Hampton and
Colonel Champ, the Colonial Secretary, were summoned; but the former declined
to attend. On 11th September the Council, by a majority of twenty to seven,
declared him “in contempt.” The Sergeant-at-Arms went to arrest him, and
received his written statement that the Speaker’s warrant was illegal. Mr. T. D.
Chapman induced the Council, by eighteen votes against seven, to authorise the
Speaker to issue his warrant requiring all persons to assist in apprehending
Hampton. On 14th September Hampton wrote to the Speaker that he was
willing to allow Major Fraser, the Sergeant-at-Arms, to enter his house and remain
there, holding him as a prisoner, until his legal advisers could sue out a writ of
Habeas Corpus, and the return thereto might be tried. After a long discussion, it
was resolved to execute the warrant, and on the 18th Major Fraser succeeded in
taking Hampton into custody in his own house. The Sergeant-at-Arms, in his
report, stated that Hampton refused to proceed to the bar of the House. Major
Fraser’s report was read to the Council by the Speaker, who, at the same time,
informed the members that he (the Speaker) had been served with a writ to appear
to an action at the suit of Hampton. The Sergeant-at-Arms had also been served
with a writ of Habeas Corpus. The Council resolved that the Speaker and Sergeant-
at-Arms should comply with the summons. Whilst the excited debate was pro-
ceeding, the Governor walked into the House, and, after having rested for a few
moments, read a speech, in which he said that it was “ with great reluctance ” he
felt “ compelled to interfere between the assertion and the practical enforcement of
the powers and privileges which you have thought proper to assume.” “ The law
officers of the Crown have advised the Governor and the Legislative Council that
the Speaker’s warrant is illegal.” ... “In order, then, to enable the judicial
tribunals to pronounce judgment on the legality of a warrant affecting the liberty
of the subject, I hereby, by virtue of the power and authority in me vested, pro-
rogue the Council to the 20th day of October next.” The judges gave judgment


against the Council. Hampton, meanwhile, obtaining leave of absence on the plea of
ill-health, went to Victoria, thence to England, and was never again seen in the colony.
At a meeting of Her Majesty’s Privy Council held at the Court of Bucking-
ham Palace on the Ist day of May, 1855, the Queen declared her assent to the new
“ Constitutional Act ” for Tasmania, which was the first colony of the group to
receive the grant of free institutions. The concessions made by the Home authori-
ties were most liberal. The land fund was placed at the disposal of the Legislature,
and power was given for the alteration or the amendment of the constitution, within
certain limits, when deemed advisable. The “ Constitutional Act ” was proclaimed
in the Hobart Town Gazette of the 80th October. It was necessary for the old
Council to meet and pass an electoral bill prior to the election of members for the
new Parliament, and accordingly a session was commenced on the 28th November.
The Council was invited by the Governor to pass the Estimates for 1856, and also
an “ Electoral Act.” The Council passed the “ Electoral Act,” and the Estimates
for part of the next year. They voted money for telegraph lines, for the Hobart
Town Water Works, and many other objects. They were most liberal. They
passed a Bill granting allowances to retiring officers and servants in the public
service; but the Governor refused the Royal assent to a measure which properly
came within the consideration of the new Parliament. The Council was prorogued
on 7th February, 1856.
The moral and social condition of the colony was rapidly improving. Public
works were as yet scarcely begun. In March, 1857, Hobart Town was lighted
with gas, and in October of the same year the water works of Launceston
were completed and opened. Postal communication with England was also
rendered a little more perfect, although it occupied close upon three months before
letters posted in England were received in Tasmania. Thus ends the history of
Tasmania under the old system of government.
The election of Representatives to serve in the new Parliament took place in
the months of September and October. The voting was by ballot. The members
of the Assembly, numbering thirty, were as follows :

W. T. N. Champ, Colonial Secretary and Premier; T. D. Chapman, Colonial
Treasurer; Francis Smith, Attorney-General; J. W. Rogers, Solicitor-General;
H. F. Anstey, Minister of Lands and Works; and W. E. Nairn, without portfolio,
comprised the first Ministry of Tasmania. The new Parliament was opened on
Tuesday, 2nd December, 1856, by Commissioners appointed by the Governor.
Judge Horne was chosen President of the Legislative Council, and Captain Fenton
was elected Speaker of the House of Assembly. On the following day the
Governor read his speech. The Honourable Thomas Daniel Chapman delivered
his financial statement on 9th December. It was not of a very cheering descrip-
tion, owing to the sudden reaction in prosperity which had overtaken the
island. To meet the deficiency in the revenue, Mr. Chapman submitted a new
Customs Tariff, increasing the duties on tea, sugar, wines, spirits, tobacco, and
other articles included in the Tariff of 1852. The proposal to increase taxation,
after much disputing and debating, was immediately settled by the resignation of
Ministers over a motion of Mr. T. G. Gregson, who proposed a reduction of the
Governor’s salary, as well as the salaries of the Colonial Secretary, Colonial
Treasurer, and Attorney-General. It was urged by Mr, Champ that a reduction in
the Governor’s salary would be a breach of faith, and a premature interference
with the provisions of the Constitutional Act. Several amendments were proposed,
but lost, and on Mr. Gregson’s motion being carried, Ministers resigned. Mr.
Gregson being called on to form a new Ministry, his Cabinet took office on 26th
February, 1857. A vote of censure, carried in the House of Assembly by a large


majority, compelled Mr. Gregson’s Ministry to resign office on 25th April, when
Mr. Weston was called upon to form a new Ministry.
The second session of the first Parliament of Tasmania was opened on 13th
October, 1857. There had been a decline of revenue since the beginning of 1855,
and it was therefore necessary to provide for the enormous deficiency. For this
purpose increased duties upon wines, spirits and tobacco were proposed to
Parliament and granted. A direct tax of 6d. in the pound on the annual
value of property, to be called a police rate, was also agreed to, and dogs were to be
taxed five shillings a head. Some other imposts were fixed upon, but were
exceedingly unpopular, especially the duty of per cent, on probate of
wills. The “Abbott claim” occupied much time in the session of 1858. Mr.
Edward Abbott claimed compensation for the loss of 210 acres of land on the
Launceston swamp, originally granted to his father, the late Major Abbott, but
afterwards resumed by the Government. The case was for many years considered
by the Home authorities. Mr. Abbott claimed something over £15,000 as compen-
sation , but the commissioners to whom it was referred awarded £2012, an amount
which made Mr. Abbott very indignant, as he had previously refused £7OOO.
However, on 10th December, 1860, a further sum of £3OOO was awarded, and this
ended the disagreeable matter. The second Parliament of Tasmania opened on 15th
August, 1861, whereupon Mr. Robert Officer was elected Speaker, and Dr. Butler
Chairman of Committees. Out of the thirty members composing the House of
Assembly, thirteen were new men. At the close of 1861, Governor Young’s term
of office expired. He and Lady Young were extremely popular with the Tasmanians.
Sir Henry Young left Tasmania with his family on 10th December, 1861, in the
“ City of Hobart,” for Melbourne. Sir Henry was afterwards gazetted Governor
of New Zealand, but never took the appointment, and lived almost a retired life
in London, where he died on 18th September, 1870. He was succeeded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Gore Browne, the eighth Governor of the colony, who
arrived at Hobart Town from Sydney on the Ist December, 1861. His
brilliant military career and popularity in New Zealand obtained for him a
very favourable reception in Tasmania. Much depression prevailed at the time;
the political atmosphere was disturbed by the proceedings of Parliament, and it
was found necessary to resort to additional taxation. The withdrawal of the troops
from the island in 1863, to take part in the Maori War, had the effect of decreasing
the expenditure. The land laws were not working satisfactorily; and in order to
develop the mineral resources of the colony, large sums of money had been spent
by the Government and people without corresponding results. In 1864 English
salmon had been successfully introduced under the supervision of Mr. J. A. Youl.
To encourage immigration a new Act was passed in 1867, giving land orders to all
persons paying their own passages from England. To all Europeans—civil and


military pensioners—coming from India, grants of land were made in the county of
Devon. The year 1866 witnessed three interesting ceremonies. One was the
opening of the new Town Hall in Hobart Town, which had been erected at a cost
of £10,000; the second was the opening of St. Mary’s Cathedral in Harrington
Street; and the third was that of the Church of the Apostles, in Launceston, being
ready for divine worship. In February, 1867, the corner-stone of the Hobart
Working Men’s Club was laid by the Governor. The reception of the Duke of
Edinburgh, on his visit to Tasmania in 1868, was of a most enthusiastic nature.
The Duke subsequently made a tour northward, and, among other public
ceremonies in which he took part, turned the first sod of the Wbstern Railway.
In June the first twelve miles of the Mersey and Deloraine tramway were opened
for traffic. The Royal assent was given in 1869 to the State Aid Commutation Act,
whereby the annual allowances for religious worship were replaced by endowments
with debentures, and provision was made that clergymen holding vested interests
should receive stipends. During Governor Browne’s administration two ministries
held office : the first under the Hon. James Whyte; the second under the popular
Sir Richard Dry. During the first term instructions were issued by the Queen
that all Cabinet Ministers holding office for three years should receive the title of
“ honourable ” for life. Governor Browne, although he had to administer the affairs
of the colony during a most troublous time and depressed financial condition, so
conducted himself as to gain the affection and best wishes of the Tasmanians. He
left the colony on 29th December, 1868, and was succeeded by Charles Du Cane,
Esq., who arrived on 12th January, 1869. On his arrival in England he was
created a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, and was
subsequently presented with a testimonial of plate by the colonists of Tasmania.
Although the colony was still suffering from depression, yet, during his tenure of
office as Governor, a more hopeful condition of affairs began to exist. Of the many
interesting incidents which occurred was the laying of the present submarine cable,
the passing of the Main Line Railway Bill, the inauguration of the Hobart Town
Library, and the erection of two new churches in Hobart Town. Additional
encouragement was given to agriculture and horticulture by the holding of shows
upon an extended scale, many important public works and roads were completed,
and the manufacture of wool was advanced by offering substantial bonuses. Mining,
which had hitherto been in a languishing state, also showed signs of improvement.
On Ist August, 1869, Sir Richard Dry, the Premier, died suddenly, an event which
created deep sorrow. The addition of a chancel to Hagley Church, of which he
was the promoter, was decided on as a suitable memorial in his honour. The same
year death carried off the Hon. Isaac Sherwin, member of the Legislative Council,
and the Hon. W. E. Nairne, the President; while the last man of the Tasmanian
aborigines, King Billy, also succumbed in March to the laws of Nature. In 1870


the 18th Regiment, the last battalion of Imperial troops stationed in the colony, were
ordered elsewhere. In 1871 the Launceston and Western Railway was opened by
the Governor, and in August the franchise was extended. In 1873 the Mount
Bischoff Tin Mining Company was formed, with a capital of £60,000, and from that
date the development of the great stanniferous wealth of the island began to obtain.
In 1871 the discovery of tin at Mount Bischoff, at a time when the colony was so
financially hampered, revealed a source whence prosperity might flow. The great
discovery is due to Mr, James Smith, of George Town. He was an enthusiastic
explorer, and discovered vast deposits of tin forty-five miles from Emu Bay, at the
mount named in 1825 after the chairman of the Man Diemen’s Land Company.
Many gold mining ventures had failed, as also silver mining at Penguin;
coal mining was equally unprofitable; and the profits from agriculture were at
the lowest ebb. Mr. Du Cane left Tasmania in November, 1874, and sub-
sequently received the honour of knighthood for his eminent and useful services.
He was succeeded by Frederick Aloysius Weld, Esq., the tenth Governor of
Tasmania, who arrived at Launceston on 11th February, 1875. He had gained
considerable colonial experience as Minister of Native Affairs and Premier in
New Zealand, and subsequently as Governor of Western Australia. At this time
political strife and personal antagonism of a most bitter character greatly impeded
the progress of Tasmania. The Kennerley, Reibey, Fysh and Growther ministries,
in succession, attempted to administer public affairs up to October, 1879. An
alliance of political parties and a reorganisation of finance was brought about by
the Giblin Coalition Ministry. A duty of 9d. in the pound was levied on the value
of landed property, and on dividends ; an excise duty of 3d. per gallon on beer was
also charged, and the Customs Tariff was revised. Sir Robert Omeer, Speaker of
the House, died in April, 1877, and was succeeded by Dr. Henry Butler. Tin was
found near Mount Humskirk, in 1876; and good crushings of gold quartz were made
from the Native Youth (Nine Mile Springs) and City of Hobart (Black Boy)
claims. In 1877, the Tasmania Reef, at Beaconsfield (then Brandy Creek) was
discovered by Mr. W. Dally, and in 1878 the Blue Tier Reefs were developed. In
the same year a public testimonial was presented to Mr. James Smith by the
Government at Launceston, in recognition of his valuable discovery, and a life
pension of £2OO a year was conferred on him. The Scab Act (1870,) framed by
the Hon. James Whyte, freed the sheep of Tasmania from scab disease, and
increased their value in eleven years from £298,564 to £486,398. Governor Weld
retired from the administration in May, 1880, to accept the new position as Governor
of the Straits Settlements, and, like his predecessor, was knighted. Sir Thomas
Smith acted as administrator for nearly seven months, until the arrival of Sir
John H. Lefroy, who filled the position of Lieutenant-Governor up to the arrival of
Sir George Strahan in December, 1881. During Lefroy’s tenure of office the Giblin

THE FIRST COLONY UNDER RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT.


Ministry succeeded in carrying bills for main roads and public buildings ; there was
also a reduction effected in the intercolonial rates of postage; penny postal cards
were issued, and Post-office Savings Banks established. In the death roll of 1881
the names of Mr. James Erskine Calder, Sergeant-at-Arms in the House of Assembly;
Mr. Hugh Munro Hull, Clerk to the House; and the Hon. F. M. Innes, President
of the Legislative Council, who died suddenly, may be mentioned. A census of
the population, taken on 3rd April, 1881, gave a total of 115,008, which represented
an increase of 25,000 in twenty years.
Sir George Cumine Strahan, K.C.M.G., previously Governor of the Windward
Islands, and for a time the administrator of the government of Cape Colony,
arrived in Hobart Town on 7th December, 1881. In 1882 a marked improvement
in the affairs of the colony began to be visible; there was a substantial surplus, and
the property tax was reduced from 9d. to 6d. A long-deferred grant was made for
the construction of the Deloraine to Formby railway, and votes were passed for
roads, bridges, and public works. A vote of £30,000 for immigration purposes was
also carried. At the end of 1882 the revenue for the two years had increased to
£110,782 without any additional taxation, and in the following year it totalled the
sum of £13,000 more. Gold discoveries in 1883 in the Pieman and King River
districts encouraged prospecting associations. Both Houses assented to the raising of
£BOO,OOO on loan for public works and railway construction. There was a remission
of Customs duties to the extent of £17,000, and £BOOO was voted for the Oatlands
and Paratah railway.
The Governor’s salary and allowances were raised to £SOOO. A convention
of colonial delegates at Sydney agreed to a Federal Council Bill, which led to the
subsequent meeting of such council in Hobart Town in January, 1886. Representa-
tives of Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, and Fiji met in the
Legislative Council Chamber, and deliberated for several days. In February, 1883,
the first Tasmanian Exhibition was opened in Hobart Town, and continued to
attract large attendances for nearly three months, In September Dr. Sandford,
Bishop of Tasmania, arrived, and was enthroned at St. David’s on the 12th of that
month. In 1884 railway construction was vigorously prosecuted. In February
Mr. W. A. B. Gellibrand was elected as the new President of the Council, he being
the first native-born appointed to that position. In August, on the resignations of
Mr. Giblin as Premier and Attorney-General, and of Mr. W. Moore as Chief
Secretary, the Douglas Ministry, comprising Messrs. Douglas, Dodds, Brown, and
Burgess, was formed. The Franchise Bill was passed, reducing the qualifications
of electors, and providing that general elections for the House of Assembly should
all take place on the same day. Mining ventures during the year were unprofitable,
and heavy losses were incurred by speculators, owing to the mismanagement of
several companies. Mr. Phillip Butt, the eldest colonist (save one,) died during the


year. He came to the colony with Governor Collins in H.M.S. “ Calcutta ”in 1804.
Mr. Alfred Dobson succeeded Dr. Butler as Speaker in the House of Assembly, the
latter gentleman having resigned the position in 1885. Mining during the year
showed signs of revival, the gold exports being 37,4980z. as compared with
34,8140z. for the previous year, and coal mining in the Fingal district also gave
evidence of improvement. The above are some of the leading incidents which
occurred during the administration of Sir G. C. Strahan, who was succeeded by
Sir Robert George Crookshank Hamilton, twelfth Governor of the colony. He
arrived, with Lady Hamilton and family, by the “Doric,” on 11th March, 1887,
and was accorded a most hearty welcome. He had previously held that most
unenviable position, the Chief Secretaryship of Ireland, which he vacated in
November, 1886, as his views on the Irish question were not in accord with those
of the Cabinet. This fact gained for him a thorough Irish welcome from all those
whose sympathies are with that disturbed, distressed and distracted country. His
Excellency was officially sworn in at the Supreme Courthouse on the day of his
arrival, he being escorted there by an immense procession. On the 22nd of the
month the new Governor visited Launceston, and a short time afterwards Latrobe
and other western townships. A visit was subsequently paid to the Richmond
district; and wherever he and Lady Hamilton went, loyalty was manifested. On
the 24th of March the Agnew Ministry resigned, and a Ministry consisting of
Messrs. Fysh, Braddon, Bird and Clark was formed. The first iron vessel built in
the colony was launched by Messrs. Kennedy and Co., on the 28th March. It was
a steam dredge, built by that firm for the Tasmanian Government, and reflected the
highest credit upon all concerned in her construction. On sth April two notable
personages—the Earl and Countess of Aberdeen—visited Government House ; and
before their departure from the colony, they received a handsome testimonial, and
gifts from an influential section of the community. The colony of Tasmania has
entered on the centennial year of Australian colonisation with a very fair prospect
before her. The financial affairs of the colony are, it is true, not all that can be
desired; but the people seem disposed to submit to any measures necessary to
promote the prosperity of the island.
Important ministerial changes occurred during the year 1887, which wit-
nessed the demise of the Coalition formed on 30th December, 1879. Parliament
met on 12th July, the Hon. Thos. Reibey being elected Speaker in succession to the
Hon. A. Dobson, and on 20th July the colony was startled by the Treasurer’s
budget speech, which showed a deficiency on the 30th June previous of £70,000,
and a total estimated deficiency on the 30th June, 1888, of £164,000. To increase
the revenue above the expenditure several imposts were proposed, all of which
passed the Llouse of Assembly; but on the first item being rejected by the Council
—a tax on the unimproved capital value of land—Ministers withdrew the scheme.


Many important legal changes occurred during the year 1887, the death of Mr.
Justice Giblin on 18th January creating a vacancy, which was offered, by telegram,
on 6th February, to the Hon. J. S. Dodds, then at Adelaide, en route to the Imperial
Conference. He accepted the position of Senior Puisne Judge, and, reaching
Launceston, on his return from England on 12th July, took his seat on the bench
on 15th July. The third judgeship, created by a Bill passed in 1886, was, after
having been offered in February, 1887, to Mr. John Mclntyre, of Hobart, with a
condition that he would reside in the north, who refused it, accepted uncondi-
tionally by Mr. R, P. Adams, the Solicitor General. Many other changes in the
legal profession occurred. In no part of the wide dominions of Queen Victoria
was the Jubilee year of her reign more loyally celebrated than in the Australian
Colonies, and Tasmania vied with her neighbours in demonstrations of allegiance.
The most permanent record of the proceedings was the laying of the foundation-
stone of the Museum and Art Gallery in the old Barrack Reserve (better known as
the Depdt Grounds,) at Launceston. The mining industry revived greatly during
1887, the advance in the price of tin giving a great impetus to this enterprise; and
the further development of the tin lodes of Ben Lomond uncovered rich stone that
created a great revival in that district. In gold mining progress has also been
made in reefing at Lefroy, the reefs at Matthina having been taken up with
encouraging prospects, since new reefs have been discovered there and at Mangana.
Silver mining also shows evidence of improvement, but coal mining appears to be
unremunerative, although the Cornwall Company is steadily increasing its output.
Several companies and have been projected, and no doubt the coal
deposits will be found eventually to give good returns. On the whole, Tasmania is
in a very good position, considering the difficulties with which she had to contend
for years; and there is every prospect, with wise legislation, the cessation of political
strife, the development of her resources, and the perseverance of the inhabitants,
that a new and brighter era will set in with the Centennial Year of
1888.

WILLIAM JOHN MONKS
Was born at Hobart in 1860, and is the only son of Mr. John
Monks, of Derbyshire, England. He was educated at Hobart,
and at the age of 14 years was apprenticed to a carriage
builder. Eventually he started business for himself at the
corner of Barrack and Collins-streets, where he is still doing a
flourishing trade. His factory turns out light and heavy
carriage and cart work, and his connection extends to Laun-
ceston, and all parts of the colony. About 14 employes find
work there, and the annual turnover is close on £3OOO.
Weekly wages vary from £25 to £35. Mr. Monks was married
in 1883 to the second daughter of Mr. Bichard Lowe, of
McQuarrie Plains, and has three children.
PETER AND SAUL,
Launceston.
Although it is not known when iron was first manufactured, yet
it is believed to have been at a very ancient date, as the remains
of implements, manufactured in pre-historie times, are so
numerous as to leave no doubt as to the extreme antiquity of
the use of that metal. At the time of the Assyrians, iron
appears to have been in extensive use, as saws, knives, and other
tools have been found at Niuevah many of which are similar
to those in use at the present day. Through the influence of
the Eomans, the manufacture of iron was introduced over the
then-known world, though its uses seems to have been known in
Britain, previous to the Eoman invasion. The precise date
of the introduction of cast iron is unknown, though the
probable date is somewhere in the 14th or 15th century, and
in the 16th century cannon of three tons weight were cast.
In the early history of the Australasian colonies it was difficult
for the people to procure even the ordinary implements, as,
on account of the great distance from England, purchasers
were required to purchase twelve months in advance of their
wants, and settlers were almost forced to manufacture for their
own consumption. In 1833 Mr. John Williams built the
first foundry erected in Launceston, Tasmania, and continued
the business until 1843, when he sold out to Mr. Wm. Peter,
who had arrived in the colony but a short time previous to
that date- Mr. Peter at first confined himself to the manu-
facture of iron eastings for agricultural machinery, which he
supplied to the agricultural manufacturers in the northern
portion of the island, but, as time went on, he added
the general line of iron and brass castings. The first
important addition was 1851, when he commenced the manu-
facture of stoves, which to-day have a large sale through the
colony, under the name of “ Peter’s Stoves.” In April, 1875,
he received from Mr. Swift the first pig-iron produced in
Tasmania, and to test the quality of that metal he manu-
factured the same into ovens, railings, pulleys and tramway
wheels, and it is satisfactory to state that the work resulting
from these castings was durable, and there was only the usual
amount of slag, showing the waste to be nominal. The dis-
covery of gold and tin in the northern end of the island created
a demand for mining machinery, and the orders received being
in excess of the capacity, it was found necessary to increase
the plant. In 1883, Mr. Wm. Peter retired, and sold out the
business to Messrs. Peter and Saul, the present proprietors,
who have made a specialty of the manufacture of ornamental
castings and marine engines, and were the first in the northern
part of the island to put together an iron steam dredge, now used
in the river Tamar in the vicinity of Launceston ; they are also
devoting some attention to the manufacture of stationary engines
for sawmills; have manufactured the iron work for a number
of the principal buildings in Launceston, among which may
be mentioned the Academy of Music, Bank of Australasia, and
the Custom House. The Mount Bischoff tin and other mining
companies have had a number of orders executed by this firm.
It will be pleasing to note that since Messrs. Peter and Saul
took posession of the business, they have been compelled to
double the force of employes.
WILLIAM C. ELTHAM
(Messrs. Grubb & Eltham, General Produce
Merchants).
This gentleman is a native of Hobart, and the only son of Mr.
W. Eltham, of England. He was educated at Hobart, passing
the State School examination at the age of 13 years. His
first introduction to business pursuits was in the book trade
with Messrs. Walch and Co., where he remained for four
years, but joined with Messrs. Grubb Bros, as managing
c lerk in 1877, and entered partnership as above in 1886.
The business was originally established in 1854 by Mr. Hed-
berg, who remained therein until the succession of the present
proprietors. Mr. Eltham was married in 1883 to the step-
daughter of Mr. B. J. Eogers, of Hobart, and has two children.
The Orpheus Club, the senior musical c lub in the colony,
claims him as its conductor. He is also choir master and
organist of St. Andrew’s Church, and a member of the Order of
Oddfellows.
MR. J. McELUCE,
Galvanised ironworker and plumber, Launceston, Tasmania.
It is an undoubted fact that more articles are used in Austral-
asia which are manufactured from galvanised iron than in
any other part of the world containing the same population.
In the year 1881 Mr. McEluce established himself in Laun-
ceston for the manufacture of every variety of galvanised iron
work both for the wholesale and retail trade. His specialities
are spouting, ridge cappings, chimney cowles for lengthening
the flues of chimneys, water pipes for conducting water from
the roofs of buildings to the cisterns, and large galvanised
tanks and cisterns capable of holding from ten to one thousand
gallons of water. In addition to those already enumerated,
Mr. McEluce has facilities for making every variety of dust
bins, buckets and tinware for domestic use. The galvanised
sheets are imported from the English market, and are manu-
factured on the premises. To manufacture spouting, the sheet
is first cut the desired width by means of a knife seven feet
long; the shape is then given by means of a heavy pressure being
brought to bear on the galvanised iron after it has been placed in
moulds. A man and boy can put through about a ton of iron
in a day. Circular spouting for conducting water is manufae-


tured by introducing the required width of sheet iron between
rollers and soldering the edges together. Aside from these
specialities already mentioned, Mr. McEluce is able to supply
to the trade every variety of out-door work which appertains
to his trade. He also supplies largely to the mining com-
panies galvanised iron pipes for hydraulic sluicing, and large
iron pipes for ventilating the shafts of mines.
CHARLES E. DAVIES.
Mr. Davies was born in New South Wales, May 13th, 1847.
He received his education principally at the High School, !
Hobart. In September, 1868, he obtained the degree of i
Associate of Arts. From 1865 to 1870 he held a position in
the Civil Service, Victoria, when he joined his father, the late
John Davies, and, conjointly with John George Davies, took
the management of the Hobart Mercury. In 1871 he succeeded to
the proprietorship of that well-known journal, upon the death |
of Mr. John Davies. The business since that date has been
conducted by the firm of Davies Bros. In 1877 the Tasmanian
Mail was started. The Hobart Mercury has long been regarded
as the leading newspaper of the capital, and, in consequence,
its utterances play a prominent part in the political fortunes
of Administrations.
JAMES SCOTT,
Launceston, engineer, millwright and boilermaker. The busi- i
ness was first started by Messrs. Jackson and Archibald in 1866,
and was continued by that firm until 1884, when the property was
purchased by the present owner, who has largely increased
the facilities by the purchase of extensive machinery. Mr.
Scott makes a speciality of flour mill machinery, and his
operations in this branch extend over all the northern portion
of the colony. He is at present putting up extensive irrigating
works in the interior of the island, which will drain over 1300
acres of land. Mr. Scott has also recently added extensive
machinery for the purpose of manufacturing boilers on a more
extensive scale, and is now prepared to build boilers with a
capacity of from forty to fifty horse power.
LAUNCESTON OMNIBUS & TRAMWAY
COMPANY LIMITED.
Prior to 1886 the public vehicular traffic in Launceston was
of an uncertain and unsatisfactory nature, but on that date
Mr. James Hamilton, the present manager of the Launceston
Omnibus and Tramway Company, Limited, organised the com-
pany, and the public are now supplied with an efficient omnibus
service from the centre of the town to all the principal
suburbs for a radius of three miles, and one to St. Leonards, a
distance of five miles. These separate lines are all run punc-
tually to a duly advertised time table, similar to that issued
by the Railway Department. The company was Incorporated
in April, 1886, with a capital stock of three thousand one-
pound shares since fully paid up, the objects being the run-
ning of an efficient line of omnibuses, and the manufacture of
such vehicles, buggies, carts, etc., not only for its own use,
but the trade in general, and the construction of a tramway,
so soon as the population of the city will justify its introduc-
tion. Special busses are also run to the stock sales, and race
and other meetings in the neighbourhood of the town.
MR. JOHN PARKER,
Venetian blind manufacturer, Launceston. As the colony of
Tasmania increases in population, various manufactures are
constantly springing up, as the people are beginning to find
that numerous articles can be made to as good advantage in
the colonies as in the Home country, taking into consideration
the cost of transportation, and the time consumed in transit.
In 1887, Mr. John Parker, from Leeds, Yorkshire, England,
established the first exclusive Venetian blind manufactory in
Launceston, Tasmania, and has added a valuable improvement
by which the blind can be checked in any position, and avoid-
ing the necessity of fastening on a- hook or button. The
blinds are all manufactured from California pine, which Mr.
Parker imports direct in bulk, and the timber is all cut and
fitted in Launceston. The rapid growth of the trade has
induced Mr. Parker to make a new departure by securing a
patent painting machine, the invention of a firm in New
Zealand. This machine is capable of painting 2000 ft. per
hour, and does the work more evenly than can be performed
by hand. At the present time, on account of the prohibition
duty in the other colonies, Mr. Parker has confined his trade
to Tasmania, but will be prepared to export as the business
developes.
ANDREWS & SEDDON,
Manufacturers of Liquid and Paste Blacking,
Dubbing, &c.
In the early days of the colonies all manufactured goods were
imported from England and foreign countries, but as time
went on small manufactories were started, and at the present
day nearly all the necessities of life are manufactured in Aus-
tralasia. Not least among these is the manufacture of polish,
blacking, writing ink, and like preparations. This industry
was first started by Messrs. Andrews and Seddon, in Launces-
ton, Tasmania, and is the only manufacturing establishment
of the kind in the colony. Their specialities are self-shining
liquid blacking, for which they have adopted as a registered
1 trade mark “ The Black Kingand it is the purpose of the
i firm to establish a reputation for their goods equal to any
English manufacture. Another important branch is the
manufacture of waterproof dubbing, which is not only valuable
as a renovator, but is almost indispensable in the country
districts, where rats abound, as these animals will not inter-
; fere with harness and other leather on which the dubbing has
{ been used. Messrs. Andrews and Seddon are also manufac-
turing a brass composition for polishing brass, and a superior
quality of writing ink, which is put up in various sized bottles
to suit the purchaser, and at present have a trade not only in
| Tasmania, but also in the Australasian colonies.


BANK OF TASMANIA,
Launceston.
This bank was first established in 1852 as a private bank
under special act of Parliament. The first manager was Mr.
Francis Evans, who held the position until his death in 1870,
and was succeeded by Mr. T. H. Flexman, who resigned on
account of ill health, after serving* twelve years. His suc-
cessor was Mr. Arthur Evans. The bank experienced a very
chequered existence, and suffered severe losses by robbery and
defalcation. In 1884, as the manager of the Beaconsfield
branch was returning home one evening, he was seized by
armed men, who were disguised. These men bound him, tied
a pillow-case over his head, and fastened him to a tree. The
keys of the bank were then taken ; one of the gang was left in
charge of the prisoner, while the others proceeded to the bank,
fiom which they abstracted all the coin and notes, amount-
ing to between three and four thousand pounds. On a signal
being given by the firing of a gun, the man left in charge un-
bound the manager, and he was set at liberty. Several per-
sons were arrested on suspicion, but the evidence of identifi-
cation was not sufficient, and they were discharged. These
persons brought actions against the bank, and secured heavy
damages, almost equal in amount to the sum abstracted. One
of these men was subsequently convicted for circulating the
notes, and was sentenced for two years. Another was con-
victed of perjury, he having denied at trial that he was an ex-
convict from West Australia. This man turned informer, in-
culpating all those who had been previously arrested. Two
of them were placed on trial, but a conviction was not ob
tained. These repeated losses induced the management
to review the position of the bank, and to give confidence
to the shareholders. Mr. Geo. Horne, a leading accountant
and financier of Melbourne, was invited to investigate
and report. Acting on his report, the directors en-
trusted to him the re-organisation of the bank. This having
been successfully accomplished, a new institution was formed,
entitled the National Bank of Tasmania, with a capital stock
of £150,000, in twenty thousand shares of £7 10s. each, paid
up to £5. Mr. Geo. Horne was appointed manager of the
new bank. After a prosperous career of two years, the di-
rectors were able to report in May, 1887, that the business of
the bankhad more than doubled, and a reserve fund of £12,000
had been created. The company have purchased a site cen-
trally located, and a new bank is nowin course of construction,
which will be completed by May, 1888.
THE AUSTRALIAN WIDOWS’ FUND LIFE
ASSURANCE SOCIETY, LIMITED.
This society was organised in the city of Melbourne, Nov.,
1871, and assumed its title from the Scottish Widows’ Fund
Life Assurance Society, one of the most successful as well as
one of the oldest mutual societies in the world. In 1883,
after a prosperous career of twelve years, the directors de-
cided to extend their operations to the other colonies, and in
the early part of that year a branch for the colony of Tas-
mania was established at Launceston, and such was the
success of the venture, that after two years, as more com.
modious accommodations were required, a piece of land was
purchased in St. John-street, and the erection of the present
new structure was commenced. Owing, however, to numerous
delays, it was not completed until April, 1886, the total cost
being nearly £IO,OOO. The building, a three-storey structure,
is built of brick, cemented over in imitation of stone, and is
located in the business centre of Launceston. The company’s
headquarters occupy a portion of the ground floor, while the
remainder is divided into offices. The Widows’ Fund is a
purely mutual life assurance society, and the following figures
will show its progress during one decade of its existence. In
1876, 2557 policies were issued, the amount assured reaching
the sum of £541,338, but in 1886 the number had increased
to 21,959, which reached the munificent sum of £4,844,101,
showing an increase in ten years of £4,299,763. The Tas-
manian branch is now under the management of the resi-
dent secretary, Mr. A. Murell, and as there is no local board
of directors, the entire responsibility devolves upon him.
WAVERLEY WOOLLEN MILLS,
Launceston.
In the year 1865 the Government of Tasmania offered a bonus
of £IOOO for the first 1000 pounds worth of woollen goods
manufactured in the colony from Tasmanian wool. No one
in the colony seemed to be enterprising enough to take ad-
vantage of this offer until in 1871 Mr. Peter Balman con-
ceived the idea of erecting a mill and securing the reward.
After some correspondence with woollen manufacturers in
New Zealand, from whom he received valuable information
and encouragement, the present site was secured, with one
hundred feet fall of water. On the 25th of January, 1872,
Mr. Balman took passage for England, and on his arrival
there spent two months travelling through all the principal
manufacturing towns in the south of Scotland. While there
he entered into a partnership arrangement with the Messrs.
Johnston, who agreed to proceed to Tasmania to take charge
of the manufacturing department, leaving to Mr. Balman the
commercial and financial part of the business. In Dec., 1872,
Mr. Balman sailed for Tasmania, and arrived home during
the following March, but, owing to numerous delays, the fac-
tory was not in running order until May, 1874, when the first
wool was placed in the carding machine by Mrs. Balman. On
the 22nd of August following, the first production was offered
for sale at auction, and evoked a great deal of enthusiasm, as
may be gathered from the fact that the first piece of tweed
was bid oil at £2 per yard, and the aggregate sale amounted
to £1143 9s. 3d. The site of the mill is two-and-a-half miles
east from the city of Launceston, and was selected on account
of the abundant supply of fine soft water. The power for
driving the machinery is developed by a ten-inch Leffel tur-
bine wheel, which makes 930 revolutions per minute, the water
being conveyed through 1050 feet of sixteen-inch iron pipe,
manufactured by Mr. Knight, of Launceston. The wool is
purchased direct from the farmers, and after being scoured is
carried through the various stages of manufacture until
finished. Although the principal products of the mill are


tweeds and blankets, yet serges, shawls, and flannels are
manufactured. The product of the mill finds a market in the
Australian colonies, the blankets having a particularly good
reputation. There being a large demand for ready-made
clothing in Tasmania, which had up to that time been im-
ported into the colony, Mr. Balman in 1884 established a
wholesale clothing manufactory, having received the services
of a competent man to take charge of that department. The
clothing is all manufactured from the product of the Waverley
Mills, and finds a market in all parts of the colony of Tas-
mania.
A. & J. COSGROVE,
Kings Meadows, Manufacturers of Bricks.
This industry was first established in May, 1885, though the
first three months was occupied in clearing the land prepara-
tory to erecting the works. Have two brick-mills, which are
worked by horse-power, each of which is capable of grinding
the clay for ten thousand bricks per day. Messrs. Cosgrove
have six workmen in their employ, and as all the bricks are
made by hand they find a ready market for the product in
Launceston and vicinity, though orders are frequently re-
ceived from the interior towns in the colony.
CAMPBELL’S POTTERY WORKS,
Launceston.
The invention of this most important art dates back to pre-
historic times, and its application is almost universal, par-
ticularly for household use. The discovery of ancient pottery
in the recent excavations is of great value to the historian, as
the inscriptions and figures in bas-relief give the most reliable
information to the student. This is particulary true as regards
ancient Egyptian pottery. At first it was assumed that the
clay was moulded by hand without the use of a wheel, and
was baked not in the sun, as supposed by many, but in an
open fire in a very rough and imperfect manner, and the black
colour of many of the vessels recently discovered is supposed
to have been due to the smoke from the fire used in the baking.
The Egyptians are believed to have been the first nation to
make any extensive use of pottery, though the Chinese lay
claim to be among the first to discover the art of making
porcelain; though it is now believed from more trustworthy
information that the manufacture of pottery commenced in
China as early as b.c. 2697, and that of porcelain from b.c.
206 to a.d. 25. The early history of English pottery is some-
what vague, but little other than the commonest sort for
domestic use was made during the 16th century. In the early
days of Tasmania the manufacture of pottery was limited, but
early in 1876 the City of Launceston called for tenders for
£IO,OOO worth of pipe, to be manufactured in the town. This
induced a number of manufacturers in Victoria to come to
Tasmania and establish works, bringing all the necessary
machinery. The successful competitor was Mr. Alfred Corn-
wall, who established on a permanent footing a pottery for
the manufacture of pipe, which he carried on successfully for
four years, when he sold out the business to Mr. John Camp-
bell, a former Mr. Campbell soon found that there
was a want for the finer grades of crockery, and imported
skilled workmen from the other colonies for the manufacture
of stoneware ; and, as the clay in the neighbourhood was not
found to be suitable for the purpose, he was compelled to
bring it from a distance. With these additional facilities he
was able to produce bottles, household crockery, and the finer
grades of flower pots. The force of workmen was now neces-
sarily increased. In 1882 a new kiln was built for burning and
finishing the better grades of ware, and the following year the
plant was still further enlarged by the erection of a new
building and an additional kiln 21 feet in diameter. In 1885,
there being a demand for a still finer class of goods, Mr.
Campbell put up an addition, 60 x 70 feet, for the purpose of
manufacturing Rockingham and cane ware, and a still further
force of skilled workmen were employed, and new and expen-
sive machinery was purchased. The first Rockingham ware
was placed in the sales-room in January, 1886, the same
being warranted to stand the fire test. In this department is
included Majolica ware, including water pitchers, bread
plates with appropriate lettering, etc. A new feature was
added in 1887, consisting of hand-painted decorated ware for
household use. With his present facilities Mr. Campbell is
able to compete favourably with any pottery manufacturer in
the Australasian colonies.
FRANCIS ROWNTREE.
Mr. Rowntree is a native of Hobart. At the age of 17 he
commenced his apprenticeship with Mr J. Clark, and subse-
quently became foreman for Mr. Smith, of the Tasmanian
Ironworks, holding the position for three years. In 1876, he
commenced business on his own account. He employs 12
hands and does a large local trade, principally in marine en-
gineering. The reputation which he has established for his
products is second to none, and his business continues to
expand and prosper. In 1876 he married the only daughter
of Mr. J. Fearnley, of Hobart.
E. BURROWS.
Mr. Burrows was born in Hobart in 1853. He is the third
son of Samuel Burrows, Esq., of England, who came to the
colony many years ago. Mr. Barrows learned the carriage-
making trade with Mr. Monk, and subsequently worked for a
few years as a journeyman, then commencing business for
himself in Elizabeth-street, from which he removed to Melville-
street, where he conducts an excellent trade. He gives em-
ployment to seven hands and devotes his attention principally
to light work, including cabs, coaches, phtetons, landaus. He
also turns out some heavy work. His aim is to sell only the
best on the market, including materials and workmanship.
Mr. Burrows is a member of the Society of Oddfellows and
takes a deep interest in the progress of that order. In 1873 he
married the eldest daughter of Mr. Joseph Goodwin, by whom
lie has had six children.


JOHN HENDERSON.
Mk. Henderson is a native of Aberdeen, Scotland, being the
eldest son of Geo. Henderson, Esq., of Aberdeenshire. Mr.
Henderson came to Tasmania in December, 1844, having been
engaged as a cutter for a Hobart firm, with whom he remained
until 1886, when he commenced business on his own account
at 61 Elizabeth-street, Hobart, as clothier and outfitter. He
employs from 18 to 22 hands, and is doing a first-class busi-
ness. The shop is well stocked with all the best lines of
English, French, American and other goods. In 1878, he
married the only daughter of Mr. Charles Read, of Aberdeen-
shire, by whom he has had four children. Mr. Henderson is
one of the best cutters in Australasia, and therefore commands
the entire confidence of those who wish to be well dressed.
JOHN ANTHONY MOORE.
Mr. Mooee is the eldest son of Dr. Moore, of Lancashire,
England, who came to Tasmania in 1842, returned to England,
and came out again in 1845. He married and settled down,
residing at North Norfolk until nearly the date of his death,
1878. His father before him was also a doctor. The subject
of this sketch was educated at the High School, Hobart, and
at the age of 16 went to Victoria, where he remained for 12
years. Returning to Tasmania, he bought “Lachlan Col” i
Estate in 1879. He holds 800 acres, of which 15 acres are
devoted to hops, and 11£ acres to fruit. Mr. Moore was
a member of the Municipal Council, and is now a member of
the Road Trust, District Coroner, and Lay Reader for the
parish of North Norfolk. He irrigates his hop yard by gravi-
tation, and upon his estate are a number of very large English ;
trees, said to be the largest in the colony. He married in
1879, the second daughter of F. H. Wise, Esq., cf North
Norfolk, and has a family of five children.
RALPH TERRY.
Mb. John Terry was born in Yorkshire, and received his early
education in England. In 1818 he disposed of his property
and proceeded to New South Wales, taking with him his wife
and a family of 11 children, one of the latter being the sub-
ject of this sketch, Mr. Ralph Terry. In consequence of
having land grants at New Norfolk and Macquarie Plains he
left N.S.W., and arrived in Tasmania in 1820, settling at New
Norfolk, where he built a flour mill on the banks of the Der-
went, the mill being driven by the Lachlan Rivulet. Mr. John j
Terry died in 1844, the property passing into the possession
of his son, Ralph, who still conducts the milling business-
Mr. Terry has been a member of the Municipal Council for
24 years, and a Territorial Magistrate for 26 years : he was
also Chairman of the Road Trust for many years. He holds
600 acres of land in the district, part of which, at the
“ Lachlan Mills ” Estate, is used for fruit-growing. He mar-
ried, in 1846, the eldest daughter of the late Lieut. James
Simmons, of the Royal Artillery, and has had a family of 11. j
Two sons are engaged on the estate.
A. T. W. DOWNIE.
Me. Downib is a native of Hamilton, Tasmania, being the
second son of Mr. William Downie, of Scotland. His educa-
tion was received at Hamilton, North Norfolk, and Hobart.
He started sheep and agricultural farming and hop growing
on the “ Glen Derwent ” Estate. He has 14 acres under hops,
and 18 acres of fruit, and he is the proprietor of about 7000
acres in the Hamilton district. He is a member of the Muni-
cipal Council, and a Territorial Magistrate. In 1873, he
married the eldest daughter of Ralph Terry, Esq., of “ Lachlan
Mills ” estate. His yearly average yield of hops is about 13 tons.
In fruit he produces 900 bushels per annum. In the
hop seasons he employs 150 hands, his pay roll averaging £6O
per week. The Norfolk railway station is situated upon his
property. He has two large brick yards at work in the dis-
trict. He has adopted irrigation with excellent results, using
two steam engines and force pumps. It is his intention to
j commence the growth of chicory, which it is expected will
yield excellent results.
JOHN DAILY.
| Me. Daily, the son of J. R. Daily, Esq., was born in England,
i and came to Tasmania as a land steward to the late Dishop
Nixon. He served his apprenticeship as a stationer and book-
binder, which expired in 1850. He subsequently entered the
drapery trade, which he changed into a general mercantile
business on a large scale. The premises are four storeys in
height, and cover a large area in Elizabeth-street, Hobart.
Mr. Daily gives employment to 16 hands. He imports
largely, principally from London, where he has representatives
in Dasinghall-street. His local trade is very extensive, and is
constantly increasing.
JOHN SEWARD.
Me. Seward was born at St. Heliers, Jersey, and came to
Tasmania in 1884, where he commenced work as a journey-
man coachbuilder. He started business as a cabinetmaker,
etc., in Goulbourn-street in 1886. The show-room is in Goul-
bourn-street, and the workshops in the rear. In the manu-
facture of household articles he evinces excellent taste, and
the workmanship is all that can be desired. He married in
1883 the eldest daughter of M. Lelong, of Jersey, and has one
child.
WM. C. RICHARDS.
Mr. Richards was born at New Norfolk, and is the eldest son
of the late Mr. Joseph Richards. He received his education
at Hobart and New Norfolk, and on the death of his father
took over his premises, store and hotel. Mr. Richards
married, in 1871, the eldest daughter of John Able, Esq., of
New Norfolk, by whom he has had seven children. In 1885
he took the Derwent Hotel at Dridgewater Junction, which
under his management soon became a highly popular
place of resort and a favourite with the travelling public.


GARDINER’S TANNERY,
Wellington Street, Launceston.
This tannery was purchased by Mr. Robert Gardiner in 1876-
It contains thirty four tan, and eleven soak and lime vats, and
six bate vats, in which the hides are placed to neutralize the
effect of the lime. The capacity of the tannery is, two hundred
sides of sole leather, one hundred and twenty-five sides of kip
and yearlings, six hundred kangaroo skins, and six hundred
sheep skins, making a total of 1525 pieces of leather per week.
To produce this stock, twenty hands are required, except during
the bark season, when additional men are employed, as large
quantities of bark are ground for export. Mr. F. J. Thomas is
superintendent of the tannery, and has been associated in that
capacity for the past ten years.
G. J. FRENCH,
Importer and Decorator, Launceston.
This business was first established by Mr. James French, who
in 1853 opened a small shop in Patterson-street, near the
present site. At first Mr. French confined himself to supply-
ing the retail trade, but as the business increased he imported
his merchandise directly from the English and Continental
markets, and, finding his accommodation to be too
small, he secured larger premises, and devoted himself prin-
cipally to the wholesale trade, extending his business over the
entire colony. In July, 1881, Mr. French retired from busi-
ness in favour of his eldest son, Mr. G. J. French, the present
proprietor, who, soon after taking possession, added to the
stock a full line of wall paper of the latest patterns. Another
new feature of the business is the decorative art painting, in
which department Mr. French has met with very flattering
success, as he is able to compete with artists from the other
colonies. He is now prepared to decorate in the most artistic
manner both the interior and exterior of private residences,
and makes a specialty of high class window decorations. Mr.
French keeps on hand a full stock of paints, oils, and all other
goods necessary to supply his trade both for painters and
general storekeepers, also a full line of picture frame mould-
ings.
MR. R. W. ROWE,
Launceston.
In the early history of Tasmania, as well as the other Austral-
asian colonies, the people were dependent for their skilled
artisans on the mechanics who came from England and the
European countries, but as time went on the native youth of
the colonies became familiar and proficient in the various
trades, and to-day Tasmania, as well as Australia, can furnish
men skilled in all the branches of the mechanical arts.
Prominent among these is Mr. R. W. Roe, a native of Laun-
ceston, who, in 1871, associated himself in partnership with
Mr. Humphries, under the firm-name of Humphries and Roe,
contractors and builders. The firm paid special attention to
Government contracts on the north-west coast of the island.
In 1875 Mr. Roe returned to Launceston, where he established
himself in business on his own account, and since that date
has erected a number of the most prominent buildings in
Northern Tasmania, among which may be mentioned the Com-
mercial Bank, Latrobe, Bank of Australasia and Bank of 1 an
Diemen’s Land at Formby, also Commercial Bank at Long-
ford. Mr. Koe received from the Government of Tasmania
the contract for the erection of the State School at Westburj,
and the one located in Charles-street, Launceston, which was
built in 1884, and was the first as well as the largest building
for educational purposes in the town. It is needless to state
that Mr. Roe’s operations extend over the northern portion of
the colony of Tasmania, and that he has been very suc-
cessful.
VERNON EVAN WICKENS
Was born in Hobart, and is the thirteenth son of George
Wickens, of London, England who came to the colonies
many years ago. Mr. V. B. Wickens was educated to the
engineering profession, and after subsequent changes took up
some land at the top of Main Creek. He is a member of the
Oddfellows and Masonic orders. In 1884 he married the
eldest daughter of Mr. John McGuinness, of Hobart, by whom
he has one boy, two years old.
OCTAVIUS BLOCKEY,
Of the Bush Inn, New Norfolk, is the eighth son of Mr. John
Blockey of London, is a native of England, and was educated
at Hammersmith and Folkstone. At the age of 14 years he
entered on a sea-faring life, at which he continued for 17
years, broken by a visit to the Victorian diggings, and finally
passing his examination as “ Master.” After leaving the mer-
cantile service, he took up his residence near New Norfolk, in
1877. Captain Blockey is a member of the Masonic order,
also of the Road Trust. In 1874 he married the youngest
daughter of Mr. Glashier, of Tasmania. He is largely
interested in horticulture and floriculture, and employs six
hands in his hotel.
J. R. RUSDEN,
Draper, Launceston.
Few such instances representative of the rapid growth of a
drapery business can be recorded in the larger cities that can
compete with that which has attended upon the establish-
ment of the business now done by Mr. 3. R. Rusden, the
draper. Mr. Rusden came to Tasmania from England inlßß4,
and with Mr. A. J. Harvey commenced business in St. John-
street, Launceston, under the firm-name of Harvey and Rusden
in new premises just completed and known as the London
House. At that time it was thought to be a mad venture to
attempt to establish a business in such an unfrequented
locality, but the firm infused so much energy in the enterprise
that the venture proved a success from the very start. Messrs.
Rusden and Harvey became noted for supplying the best
article at the lowest cash price, as previous to that time con-
siderable monopoly had existed in the trade and prices ruled


high. In 1886 Mr. Harvey was obliged to return to England
on account of private affairs, but at that time the business
was so thoroughly established that Mr. Rusden decided to pur-
chase bis partner’s interest. He soon found that increased
accommodation was necessary, and accordingly remodelled
“ London House,” and secured the large premises adjoining.
The business, conducted entirely on the cash system, has
certainly exceeded the most sanguine expectations, taking into
consideration its short existence. In 1887, “ Jubilee” year,
Mr. Rusden opened an additional department, making three
in all, namely, Manchester, Dressmaking, and Tailoring, so
that to a large extent he can be called a general provider, and
is a fair sample of what can be done by supplying a good
article at a reasonable price, combined with the judicious use
of advertising. Almost every citizen of Launceston can call
to mind some one at least of the many quaint and curious
advertisements used by him to bring his goods before the
public.
DUNCAN & CROW,
Builders and Contractors.
This firm commenced business in 1880, since which they have
built some of the principal establishments in the colony,
notably, additions to the Hobart Hospital, three large stores
for Messrs. Murdock and Sons, additions to Government
offices, Salamanca Place, Lands and Works Departments,
D’Arcy-street, Museum, and many others. This firm make
their own bricks, and have an inexhaustible supply of good
sand for building purposes. On an average they employ 50
hands. Mr. W. Duncan is a native of Forfarshire, Scotland,
and came to the colony in 1860, and for a number of years
was engaged at the Cascade Brewery. He married in 1869
the second daughter of the late George McKenzie, of Rosshire,
Scotland, by whom he has 7 children. Mr. John Crow is a
native of Lennoxshire, Scotland, and came to the colony in
1854. For some years he worked as a journeyman, and mar-
ried in 1867 the fourth daughter of Mr. F. Faulkner, of Vic-
toria, having had 8 children —6 of whom are living.
NEIL LEWIS.
Me. Neil Lewis is a native of Hobart, and was born in 1822,
being the second son of Mr. Richard Lewis. He received his
education at Thomson school, and at the age of 14 commenced
business with his father as general merchants. Mr. Richard
Lewis died in 1867, universally respected. In 1843 Mr. N.
Lewis and his brother were taken into the firm, the style of
the same being R. Lewis and Sons. Mr. Richard Lewis, who
arrived in Tasmania in 1815, ranked as one of the pioneers of
the colony. On his arrival he took up land in the Richmond
district, and this land has been held by the family since that
date. He combined the mercantile business with auctioneering.
The extensive premises of Mr. N. Lewis are at the corner of
Argyle and Collins streets, and were erected under the super-
vision of his father in 1843. He has in his possession many
letters which were directed to his father, and which are dated
in 1812, together with a copy of the Hohartown Gazette. They
are interesting reading in 1888. The business is at present
among the leading houses of Tasmania, and includes in stock
almost every article required by the general public. They are
constantly represented in London, and possess every facility
for catering to the wants of Tasmanians. Mr. David Lewis,
the eldest son, took a deep interest in political matters, and
for 10 years represented Clarence, and afterwards Central
Hobart, the most important constituency on the island. In
many benevolent undertakings and societies he took a leading
position. As a Freemason and a member of the Hospital
Board, his deeds will long be remembered. He was connected
with the Australian Mutual, a Commissioner at the Inter-
colonial Exhibition in 1856-57, a member of the Volunteer
Artillery Corps, winning the gold medal as the best shot. He
died in 1885. Mr. N. Lewis married in 1856 the daughter of
the late John W. Cox, of Launceston, by whom he has had
eight children. His eldest son, Mr. N. E. Lewis, represents
Richmond, having been elected in June, 1886. Mr. Neil
Lewis is a member of the Church of England, and his brother
was the first person baptized in that church in Tasmania.
T. W. GRUBB.
Me. Geubb is a native of Northamptonshire, England. He
came to Tasmania in 1853, with his parents. His father was
a large farmer, and for several years Mr. Grubb followed
agricultural pursuits. Mr. Grubb, sen., is still alive, and
ranks amongst the early pioneers of Tasmania. Mr. T. W.
Grubb married in 1870 the daughter of Mr. Coleman Franklin,
Huon, by whom he has had two children. Mrs. Grubb died
at an early age, and he married again in 1878 Miss C. Cuth-
burson, of Liverpool-street, Hobart, by whom he has had four
children.
CHAS. JOHN MACKENZIE, M.L.A.
Me. Mackenzie was born in India, and arrived in Hobart in
1842. He is the eldest son of Major Mackenzie, of the Honorable
East India Company’s service. Major Mackenzie was connected
with the British Army for 25 years. The Major took up some
land and commenced agricultural pursuits. Mr. Chas.
Mackenzie has been a territorial magistrate since 1864, and is
at present also a member of the Road Trust at Table Cape.
He married in 1865 the eldest daughter of Mr. Shekleton, of
Table Cape, and by her has had three children. In 1886 he
was elected a member of the Legislative Assembly for Welling-
ton, by a large majority.
TASMANIAN STEAM SAW AND
MOULDING MILLS,
Launceston, Tasmania. This industry was first established by
Mr. B. Ditcham, in 1854, and was continued under this head
until Mr. Ditcham associated himself with Mr. C. S.
Button, under the name of Ditcham, Button and Co.
This firm were the pioneers in the manufacture of sash
dcors and mouldings from cedar or pine by the use
of machinery propelled by steam. In the year 1865 they
commenced the manufacture of flooring from the native hard


wood of Tasmania, and a great deal of opposition was met j
with, as this was not previous to that time considered suitable j
for that purpose, on account of its tendency to shrink. This [
difficulty being overcome the demand steadily increased, and |
in 1885 the present firm of Ditcham Bros, successfully intro-
duced it into Melbourne with satisfactory results, as the
wood is particularly adapted for the floor of public halls,
warehouses, Ac., which are subject to heavy wear. On account
of the formation of the tongue and groove the floors are easily
laid, and as the wood is susceptible of a high polish, and free
from knots, it is in great demand where a particularly smooth
surface is required. In 1865 the saw-mill was burned to the j
gnund, but was rebuilt, and the business was carried on by
Ditcham, Button and Co., until 1879, on which date Mr.
Button sold his interest to Mr. E. C. Ditcham, who carried
on the business until 1881, when the mill was again burned
down, and Mr. Ditcham retired in favour of his sons, who form
the present firm of Ditcham Bros. They rebuilt the mill, and
fitted it up with new machinery imported from England and
America, for the manufacture of doors, sashes, mouldings,
mantels, &e., also heavy machinery for breaking down large
logs, one band saw, lathes, and planing machines. In 1886
the firm erected the first complete set of machinery for the
manufacture of bent wood, and are now prepared to supply to
the trade any article required, both for carriage building and
the manufacture of furniture, and such is the demand for this
important product that Ditcham Bros, are now making it one
of their important specialities, and to insure the best results
have secured workmen skilled in this branch from the manu-
factories of Europe. The firm have also an extensive plant
located in the southern part of the town, for the manufacture
of bone dust and flocks. This is sold extensively to the far-
mers in the colony for the purpose of fertilising the ground,
and as the product is free from any foreign matter, it has
earned for itself a reputation as being a pure article, and the
brand, “ Ditcham Pure Bone Dust,” is a sufficient guarantee of
its purity wherever it has been introduced.

Ouse), is a native of Tasmania, and at the age of 18 years
commenced agricultural pursuits in New Norfolk district, in

T. B. INNOCENT.
In the year 1839, Mr. W. Innocent established one of the first
! brick-yards in the town of Launceston, Tasmania, and as the
bricks were of a superior quality, he received a number of orders
to supply the material for many of the Public Buildings, among
them being the Post and Telegraph buildings, erected in 1858.
In later years, Mr. W. Innocent retired in favor of his son,
Mr. T. B. Innocent, who has now assumed the entire charge of
the business, and has furnished the bricks for some of the
principal business blocks in the town ; among many may be
mentioned Furguson’s and Barclay’s ironmongery shops. Mr.
Innocent has two brick yards, one located in the outskirts of
Launceston, and the other at Kings Meadows, two miles from
the town. In each of these yards a machine has been erected
for mixing the clay, the total capacity being 7000 hand-made
bricks per day.
RUSSEN’S BISCUIT FACTORY,
Launceston, Tasmania.
At the time of the first settlement of the colony of Tasmania,
the manufacture of biscuits, even in England, was quite in-
significant, all work being done by hand in a small way ; but
in 1837, or about the time that Queen Victoria ascended the
throne, machinery began to be introduced into England,
but it was not until 1848 to 1850 that the manufacture was
developed to any extent. Tasmania, in common with the
other colonies, was dependent, at first, on the English market,
but more recently Victoria was a source of supply. In 1885,
however, Mr. C. Eussen established the first exclusive factory
for the manufacture of biscuits in the colony. Previous to
that time Mr. Eussen had been engaged in the general bakery
business, but finding that the demand far exceeded the capacity
of the factory, he decided to relinquish his other lines and
confine himself exclusively to the manufacture of biscuits,
cakes of all descriptions, and aarated flour. At first a great
deal of opposition was met with, on account of a prejudice in
favour of biscuits manufactured in the other colonies, but as
time went on, this was overcome, and in 1887, Mr. Eussen’s
biscuits had earned an enviable reputation all through the
colony of Tasmania, and have gradually been crowding the
imported article out of the market, as the dealers are finding
that for quality and variety these goods cannot be surpassed.
At the present day over one hundred and twenty-eight varieties
of biscuits are manufactured, the most difficult of which are
the Cracknells, which are of a soft spongy structure, but Mr.
Eussen has been particularly fortunate in producing this
delicacy, which is equal to the best English made. It is the
purpose of Mr. Eussen to keep up the requirements of the
times by making all the latest novelties.

MESSRS. GOURLAY & LEAR.
: This business was established about the year 1850, by the
| late Mr. Marsh, at Constitution. A branch office was opened
j in 1887, at Elizabeth-street, where fruit cases are manu-
-1 factored in addition to the ordinary business. It is the inten-

of making fruit cases peculiarly adapted for shipping fruit to
the English market. In 1888 they purchased the Burges Bay
I Saw Mills, Huon River, and samples of their timber will he
shown at the Melbourne Exhibition ; a portion of the same
will also appear in the Tasmanian exhibit. They give
| employment to 26 men. They have supplied the timber for
I the Burges Bay Wharf, and as the wharf is close to their
mills their facilities for shipping their products are excellent.
1 The firm handles over 500,000 feet of timber annually. Burges
j Bay is connected by a two-mile tramway with the mills, and


as they have 350 acres of freehold, and about 300 acres
of selected land, their reserve supply is excellent. They export
largely to the Australian colonies, particularly Victoria and
New Zealand. They furnished a large quantity of timber for
the Derwent Valley railway, and have repeatedly filled
Government orders. The branch establishment has a frontage
of 100 feet to Elizabeth-street, and 100 feet to Lefroy-street.

quence of its proximity to the wharves. The frontage is
about 150 feet to Dunn-street, by a depth of about 50 feet.
The Marine Board having decided to make extensive altera-
tions in the vicinity, the firm has been given first choice, and
will in the future secure more extensive premises, having a
frontage to Macquarie-street. Mr. Tasman Lear is a native

strates that she is admirably fitted for the important and
responsible duties which devolve upon her.
H. WISE,
Contractor, &c.
This business was established in 1881, in Lefroy-street, but
increase of business necessitated taking larger premises in !
1886, when removal was made to Elizabeth-street. These
premises have a frontage of 40 feet, by a depth of 150 feet. On
an average seven hands are employed. The business com-
prises every department in the building trade. Mr. Wise has
constructed Mr. Strutt’s residence, churches at George’s Bay,
Green Ponds, and schools. Mr. Wise is a native of England,
and arrived in Tasmania in 1858. He was apprenticed to the
coach-building trade, but soon abandoned it. He is an enthu-
siastic Oddfellow. The cabinet-making branch has been
discontinued on account of the pressure of other business.
Mr. Wise married, in 1857, the second daughter of Mr. James

1882. In 1853 he married the only daughter of Mr. Kelly, of
County Clare, Ireland.
LAUNCESTON HIGH SCHOOL,
Launceston, Tasmania. Our cut shows Milton Hall, adjoin-
ing the Church. It is in this building that the High school
is carried on, and it certainly deserves more than a passing
notice. The head master is Mr. Edward Alleyne Nathan, M.A.,
who appears to be very successful in his profession, as several
of his pupils have done well at the Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge. The whole educational system of Tasmania is a
very liberal one, for by its means a lad, however poor, if he is
studious and possess ability, may win Exhibition after Exhi-
bition until finally he obtains the ,l Tasmanian,” a scholar-
ship of £2OO a year, for four years, tenable at a British Uni-
versity.
THE VICTORIA SPORTS GROUND,
Newtown, Tasmania.
In 1886 the Victoria Sports Ground was established as a place
for recreative amusement by a syndicate of 20 members. It
contains about 6| acres, being of oval form, the various tracks
being of the same shape. The centre is adapted for cricket,
while the trotting, bicycle, and other tracks are on the outer
circumference. The first race meeting was held in February,

Hotel, Newtown, and, in 1882, became the sole proprietor.
Mr. Barlow is an enthusiastic Oddfellow. He married in 1862
the second daughter of the late T. T. Cooley, of Newtown.
Of a family of six children five survive. Mr. Barlow bids fair
to make the Sports Ground a most desirable and popular
place of resort.
MRS. M. ALLEN,
Jewelry, Launceston, Tasmania. Visitors to the City of
Launceston are all impressed with the substantial blocks of
buildings, and the superiority of the retail establishments in
almost every branch of trade; indeed, it would be difficult to
find a town with the same population in all Australasia that
can compare with it. Foremost in the rank stands the
jewelry trade, and prominent in this branch is Mrs. M. Allen.
This business was established by Mr. W. H. Allen in the year
1864, who was succeeded by Mrs. Allen in 1877 ; and as she
has agents in the Home country who are constantly shipping
her every variety of the latest novelties, she is at all times
prepared to supply her customers with all the new designs
from the best manufacturers in the world. In the manufac-
turing department only the best workmen are employed, who
are skilled in every department of the art; and, as the colony
produces not only gold, but also gems of great variety, these
indigenous ornaments are in great request, particularly among
tourists. The assortment of jewelry and watches will compare
most favourably with European shops, and although the
manufacture of watches has not been attempted in the
colonies, the most skilled workmen are engaged in effecting
repairs, which are executed in the most thorough manner. A
branch was opened at Ulvcrstone, on the North-West coast of
the colony in 1886, which is under the direct superintendence
of Mr. A. Allen, the future of which is assured from the well-
known reputation of the Launceston firm.
ROLES AND JONES.
The business was established in 1856 by Smith and Boole in
a small shop on the present site, but the building was
enlarged from year to year as the constantly increasing trade
demanded. In 1880 Mr. Poole retired, and the business was
conducted under the name of Smith and Co., and was


continued under that head until the death of Mr. Smith in
1883. The stock was then purchased by Roles and Jones, the
present proprietors, who were for many years in the employ of
Mr. Smith, Mr. Roles having been his confidential clerk for
over twenty years, and Mr. Jones for six years was manager of
the clothing department. Aside from drapery, the firm are
extensively engaged in custom tailoring, and employ twenty-
five hands in this branch. In the millinery and dressmaking
department thirty hands are engaged, all the employes work-

WALLBRIDGE & CO.,
Launceston.
One of the oldest firms in Northern Tasmania carrying on the
Hot Water Engineering and Plumbing business is the house
of Wallbridge and Co., who were established in 1867. Al-
though the business is still carried on under the same firm’s
name, the present owner is Mr. A. C. Bonner, who purchased
the stock in August, 1885. Since taking possession Mr. Bon-
ner has materially increased the business and brought it up to
its present proportions, and is prepared to supply the trade
and private individuals with every variety of material in con-
nection with plumbing ana gas-fitting. In a cool climate like
Tasmania during the winter months a constant supply of hot
water in a private residence is almost a necessity, and Mr.
Bonner has been making a speciality of supplying the material
and fitting up private residences and public buildings with
hot water apparatus, which answers the double purpose of
healing the rooms of a house and at the same time supplying
hot water as it may be required. He has fitted up a number
of the public and other buildings with all the requisites in
connection with plumbing. Included in this list is the new
Custom House, one of the principal banks, and all the leading
hotels in Launceston ; has also the contract for supplying the

he was compelled to open branches in Melbourne and Sydney
to supply the demand. In 1886, he also opened a branch in
New Zealand. He has also commenced malt brewing, in
which department he has scored a success. The sale for
his goods in other colonies proves their genuine worth, and
demonstrates that Mr, Nicholls fully understands his busi-

successfully conducted by himself in conjunction with his
second son.


CORNWALL BREWERY,
Fawns and Abbott, Proprietors.
The art of brewing was known to the ancient Egyptians nearly
1000 years b.c., and it is a fact well known in history that
even the savage nations in early times prepared an intoxicat-
ing drink of some kind. The Greeks, who obtained their
civilisation from the Egyptians, we are told, prepared a wine
made from barley, which was used both on festive occasions
and in their daily life; and it is reasonable to suppose that
the discovery of beer, and its use as an exhilarating drink, was
almost as ancient as wine itself. The art of making beer is
supposed to have been introduced into England at the time of
the Eoman Conquest, as that drink was the ordinary
beverage of the soldiers under Julius G;;esar. Tasmania, like
the other colonies of Australasia, was dependent for her supply
of beer on England and the Continent of Europe until in 1824,
at which date the colony was almost in its infancy, Mr. John
Fawns built what is now the Cornwall Brewery, at Launceston,
which is one of the largest breweries in Australasia. The
capacity at first was only 22 hogsheads per week, but as time
went on this quantity was gradually increased. One of the
chief obstacles was an insufficient supply of pure water. To
obtain the supply required, a large punt, capable of carrying
many thousand gallons, was used to bring water from what is
now known as the Cataract Gorge, which is nearly a mile distant
from the Brewery. Mr. Fawns also erected a malt-house, and
exported malt to Melbourne, New South Wales, and Queens-
land. Was one of the founders of the Bank of Van Dieman’s
Land, the Launceston Gas Light Company, and the Cornwall
Insurance Company, all of which are to-day in a very flourish-
ing condition. On the death of Mr. Fawns, in 1881, Mr. J.
J. S. Fawns took charge of the business, and the work con-
tinued without interruption, the capacity at that time being
180 hogsheads per week. In 1886 Mr. Abbott, who had for
many years been manager of the Brewery, was taken into part-
nership. Aside from the manufacture of beer, a large quantity
of ale and porter is also bottled in the Brewery, and the pro-
duct is well known not only in Tasmania, but in the Aus-
tralian Colonies.
R. MILLER AND CO.,
Soap, Candle, and Soda Crystal Manufacturers,
Launceston.
As the Colony of Tasmania began to assume her proper pro-
portions various manufacturing industries were established,
and to-day nearly all the prime necessaries are manufactured
there. Not least among these manufactories is the firm of B.
Miller and Co., who, in 1878, rented a building known as
Button’s Tannery, for the purpose of manufacturing soap,
s oda, etc. At first they had great difficulties to encounter to
obtain the required permission from the Municipal Council,
but this obstacle at last being removed they were able to make
a start towards the latter part of October, and the first pro-
duct was turned out a month later; and early in 1879 the
necessary machinery was received, and both soap and candles
were manufactured on a more extensive scale. At first there
was great difficulty in introducing the goods, owing largely to
prejudice against colonial manufactures, but as time went on
this was overcome, and soon the demand had increased to
such an extent that it was found necessary to enlarge the fac-
tory. The first year Messrs. Miller imported the soda crystals,
but in 1880 they purchased a plant and manufactured soda,
not only for their own use, but also for the Tasmanian
market. In June, 1888, premises were rented in Hobart, and
a branch factory was started under the management of Mr. G.
T. Miller, the product of which supplies the trade in the
southern portion of the colony. In 1886, finding the existing
structure too small for their wants, Messrs. Miller and Co.
purchased the property and erected a new factory on the site of
the old one. Their present total production per week is
12 tons of soap, 6 tons of soda, and 4 tons of candles, which
product can be increased if required.
WM. ALDRED, JUN.,
Launceston, Tasmania.
The manufactories which arise in connection with the human
hair are very numerous, and the demand varies according to
the fluctuations of the fashions. The value also increases very
rapidly with increased length, as hair beyond thirty-six inches
will command fancy prices. The principal source of supply
is from the South of France, where the cultivation and sale of
hair of peasant girls is very common, and hawkers attend fairs
for the special purpose of engaging in this traffic, and lengths
of hair five and even six feet long are obtained from this
source. Mr. W. Aldred, junr., established himself in Launces-
ton in 1878, and devotes his special attention to the manu-
facture of every variety of wigs both for street and theatrical
purposes. He also keeps constantly on hand whips of hair
fronts for old ladies and frizzetts of every shade. It is not
generally known that hair after it has grown to a certain length
is apt to split, and unless it is properly taken care of will fall
out. To prevent such a result it is desirable that the ends
should be cut at regular intervals by a practical hairdresser.
To meet a want of restoring the hair Mr. Aldred has prepared
two preparations namely, “ Euchesma” for restoring the hair,
and “ Tripsis” for cleaning the hair and scalp. Heis also the
sole manufacturer of the celebrated Cream of Cimes, a supe-
rior dressing. These preparations have already earned for
Mr. Aldred an enviable reputation, and the demand is increas-
ing. It will be of interest to state that Mr. W. Aldred, senr., was
the first to make up ladies’ combings, which industry he estab-
lished in Hobart in the year 1867.
MR. WINDEATT,
Postmaster, Launceston.
Me. Windeatt came to Hobart, Tasmania, in 1830, but re-
moved to Launceston in 1836 or 1837. Was appointed clerk
in the Post-office Department in 1841, while but a lad. At
that time there were only two clerks in the office, and the
mail was delivered by four convict letter-carriers, but shortly
after that date free carriers were appointed. To-day, besides
the Postmaster, there are twelve letter-carriers and twelve
clerks in the office.


J. BOAG AND SON,
Proprietors of the Esk Brewery,
Tasmania.
In 1881, a small brewery was erected near the South Esk
lliver by C. S. Button, but in 1883, when the plant was pur-
chased by the present proprietors, the production was only four
hundred gallons of beer per week. But very soon the demand
so far exceeded the capacity that within a few months after
the purchase the Messrs. Boag found it necessary to add new
machinery and enlarge the vats. Since that time they have been
constantly making additions to the plant until at the close of the
year 1886 the production was seven thousand gallons per week.
In this year the firm found it to their advantage to build a
new malt-house, and commenced the erection of their new
building which was completed in March, 1887. The addi-
tional facilities afforded by the erection of this new plant
enable the Messrs. Boag to produce fifteen thousand bushels
of malt per annum, and it is their intention to export a part
of this product. In connection with the brewery there is a
bottling establishment where they bottle their own brand of
ale and stout. The product of this brewery finds a market in
all parts of the colony of Tasmania, but as the demand for
this brand of beer is so great the proprietors have thus far
been unable to export any portion of the product. Both the
members of the firm are practical brewers, Mr. Boag, senior,
having had an experience of over thirty-three years.
SALISBURY’S FOUNDRY AND
ENGINEERING WORKS,
Launceston, Tasmania. In 1852 the colony of Tasmania was
almost depopulated of her male population, on account of the
discovery of gold in the neighbouring colony of Victoria, and
although this metal was found on the eastern portion of the
island in 1868, it was not until 1874 or 1875 that the attention
of the people was to any extent drawn towards mining. At
first the machinery necessary to develop the mines was
imported to the colony, but in 1876, at the time of the valuable
discoveries of gold in Beaconsfield and Lefroy, Mr. C. E. E.
Salisbury came to Launceston, and built a foundry and
machine shops for the purpose of erecting all the necessary
machines for mining purposes, and as Mr. Salisbury had an
extensive experience in the Victorian mining districts, the
knowledge he had acquired enabled him to compete favour-
ably with manufacturers in that colony. In 1882 he was
accorded the contract to put up a very extensive pumping
plant for the Drainage Union Co., of Beaconsfield; their pumps
lift the water in a twenty-inch pipe from a depth of 420 feet,
and was one of the largest orders ever given by a mining
company. Mr. Salisbury died in 1888, before the completion
of the contract. The management of the business then
devolved upon Messrs. M'Donald and M'Kenzie, and work was
continued without interruption. During the past few years
the firm have paid great attention to the manufacture of tin-
dressing appliances under the patents of Mr. H. W. F. Keyser,
manager of the celebrated Mount Bischoff mine. A number
of these machines have been exported to the tinfields of
Northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, and are
now working with very satisfactory results. Salisbury’s foundry
has also manufactured very extensively for Mount Bischoff
Tin Mining Co. Aside from mining machinery the firm
manufacture all branches of engineering work, also large
saw-mill plants for mills in the northern timber districts.
The buildings comprise the foundry proper, machine and
fitting shop, and pattern store.
THE HON. WILLIAM CROSBY,
Eldest son of Mr. William Crosby, of Sunderland, in the
county of Durham, was born in England in 1832, and arrived
in Tasmania in 1853. He at once established himself as a
merchant. In 1859 he opened a branch of his business in
Queen-street, Melbourne. A large trade is done in imports
and exports to all parts of the world, and agencies have been
established with several leading English houses, including
Messrs. Shaw, Saville and Albion Co., The Messageries Mari-
times Co., Messrs. Green and Co., Davitt, Moore and Co., and
others. He is a Director of the Commercial Union Assurance
Co., and the Underwriting Association of London Lloyds. He
is also Consul for the Netherlands; is a member of the Legis-
lative Assembly for Hobart, a magistrate for the Territory, and
has a seat on A.M.P. Society’s Directorate, and a member of
the Masonic Order. The Hon. Mr. Crosby married, in 1859, the
eldest daughter of the late Thomas Giblin, of Hobart, by whom
he has had a family of nine children, seven of whom are
living.
ALBERT GAYLOR.
Mb. Gavlok was born at Hobart in 1844, being a son of C.
W. Gaylor, Esq., of that city. He learned the jewellery and
watchmaking trade. About seventeen years since he com.
menced business for himself in Liverpool-street, where he
still resides. In consequence of his thorough knowledge of
the trade, he soon commanded a large list of customers, and
from the first his business has grown and prospered. He
employs three assistants. Mr. Gaylor married, in 1871, the
third daughter of Mr. Martin, of Hobart, by whom he has had
three children, two of whom are living. One son is learning
the watchmaking business; the other, the youngest, is being
educated at the Scotch College, and, in 1885, took the junior
scholarship.
ROBERTS AND CO.,
Auctioneers.
Henbv Llewellyn Roberts, born in Hobart in 1831. Com-
menced business in 1865, in conjunction with John William
Abbott. Educated at the school of the late Rev. P. Camp-
bell. Parents arrived in Hobart in the year 1821. Father
was in the Commissariat. Private residence, Beaumaris,
Montpelier-street, Hobart. Business premises, 48 Murray-
street, Hobart. About the largest auctioneering firm in
Hobart; conduct great many country sales of stock (horses,
cattle, &c.) throughout Southern Tasmania.


JOHN HENRY LITHGOW.
Mh. John Henry Lithgow, whose father was the founder of j
the Balhjmoncy Chronicle, was born in the north of Ireland in j
the year 1856, his parentage being Scotch. Came to Victoria
when eight years of age. At the age of fourteen he was appren-
ticed to Mr. T. H. Walton, chemist and druggist of Fitzroy
(Melbourne), with whom he was for some eight years, when
he came to Tasmania under engagement to Mr. W. G. Weaver,
of this city. After being with him for two years, he went to
Launceston to enter the employ of Messrs. Fairthorne and j
Sons, and after being with them for some time he, in 1883, took
over the business then carried on by them at Charles-street,
Launceston, and remaining in business in Launceston for
three years he again turned his attention to the capital, and
established the business at Liverpool-street, Hobart, 1886,
which he now manages.
He has taken an active interest in all field sports, having
been for some years a member of the Launceston Regatta
committee. Is a member of the Tasmanian Union Lodge No.
536, E.C.; also the Lodge Perfect Unanimity, No. 660, S.C.
THE RIGHT REV. DANIEL MURPHY,
Bishop of Hobart.
This distinguished ecclesiastic in the Roman Catholic Church
was born in June, 1815, in the County of Cork, Ireland. His
collegiate education was obtained at the National Seminary,
Maynooth. He was ordained for the Irish mission in 1888.
Immediately after his ordination he volunteered to enter the
foreign mission service in India. Proceeding to Plyderabad,
in the “Deccan,” he was soon created Bishop of that diocese.
For 25 years he laboured zealously and successfully in that
field, and was translated by the Holy See, in the year 1866,
to Hobart, Tasmania.
Since his arrival in this colony he has devoted especial at-
tention to the educational wants of his flock. He has always
been a strong advocate of the denominational system of edu-
cation. Under his direction various Catholic schools have
been established throughout the colony, the principal ones
being Presentation Convent, Sisters of Charity, and St. Joseph’s
School, Hobart. The Presentation Convent has a first-class
boarding school for young ladies, and parochial schools in
connection with the Cathedral, the principal ones being
the Presentation and St. Patrick’s Schools in Launceston,
the Orphanage of St. Joseph, while in 1887 a new order was
introduced, called the Sisters of St. Joseph. The latter have
opened a school at Westbury, and already seemed a good
attendance.
Bishop Murphy has been instrumental in securing an ex-
penditure of £lO,OOO upon the rebuilding of St, Maiy s
Cathedral. This Cathedral is regarded by competent judges
as one of the best architectural edifices in the Australasian
colonies, the interior being particularly imposing and beauti-
ful. As an administrator, Bishop Murphy has always been
regarded as peculiarly gifted, and, therefore, successful. He
was appointed by the Holy See, in conjunction with the late j
Bishop of Bathurst, Dr Quinn, to investigate the affairs of |
the diocese of Adelaide, and the report was complimentary
to the authorities there, so far as regards Catholic education.
Bishop Murphy was present at the Ecumenical Council of the
Vatican in 1869, and was a strong advocate of Papal Infalli-
bility. He was also present at the Synod held at Melbourne
during the Administration of Archbishop Goold in 1868, and
took a prominent part in the Synod of Australasia held in
Sydney under the presidency of Cardinal Moran. As a scholar
he has always held the foremost rank, not only as a theolo-
gian, but also in the field of physical science. That his
duties are many and multifarious is apparent from the fact
that the Roman Catholics aggregate nearly one quarter of the
entire population of the colony. Many handsome churches
and several well-equipped schools have, within the past few
years, been erected in various parts of the Island. We believe
that should he be spared until June, 1888, when he will attain
his fiftieth year in the priesthood, that it is the intention of
the Roman Catholics of Australasia to celebrate the jubilee in
a manner worthy of such an important event.
JAMES MONAGHAN DOOLEY.
James Monaghan Dooley, born in Tipperary, Ireland, is the
fifth son of Patrick Dooley, of Tipperary. James received his
early education at home, and at the age of 19 joined the
ordnance survey, at that time in Waterford station; subse-
quently transferred to England, serving in the same capacity
for several years, thence for nine years under Sir R. Griffiths,
certified surveyor and valuator. Finished his career as a
valuator in Donegal under Sir R. Griffiths ; came to Tasmania
in 1856, and was district surveyor for 15 years for county
of Devon (Tas.). This county was divided, and Mr.
Dooley became the member for Devon, now East and West
Devon, he still representing East Devon with a colleague (Dr.
Young). East Devon was nothing but a wilderness when Mr.
Dooley came here, and is now one of the most prosperous coun-
ties in Tasmania. Mr. Dooley married in Preston, England, in
1840, the third daughter of John A. Malster, by whom he has
had seven children, five of whom are now living.
HENRY SWANN,
Tasmanian Confectionery Company, established in 1882,
under the management of Mr. H. Swann. Theirs is purely a
local trade. They manufacture all sorts of confectionery,
both dry, boiled, and fancy confectionery. Their premises
cover about a quarter of an acre of land, at the corner of
Barrack and Collins streets, Hobart, employing on an average
fourteen hands. Their annual turnover is between £6OOO
and £7OOO. They send goods to Launceston, North-east and
and North-west Coast. Mr. Swann, born in Kent, England, is
the eldest son of Mr. Joseph Swann, of Kent. Received his
early education in Kent, and at the age of nineteen sailed for
the Antipodes, and commenced work as a general storekeeper,
from which he has risen to his present position. The com-
pany now prepare Tasmanian fruits, preserved, or, more
properly, candied (French method), and intend showing at
Melbourne Exhibition,


PRINCE ALBERT.
THE SCONE MERINOS. OWNED AND BRED BY MESSRS. W. GIBSON AND SON.


THE SCONE MERINOS,
Owned and Bred by Messrs. W. Gibson & Son.
Anything that can be recorded of the wool industry in the
colonies of the Southern Hemisphere is of paramount impor-
tance, since that industry may be said to be the foundation of
Australia’s present prosperity. It is, therefore, with pleasure
that we are enabled to call attention to the Tasmanian
merinos of Scone, an estate which is distant some thirteen
miles from Launceston, and about a mile and a half from the
railway station at Perth. The property is almost surrounded
by the South Esk, which forms a secure boundary to the
estate, and also provides for the stock an unfailing and
abundant supply of the purest water. The mansion is situated
on the western bank of the river and is surrounded by extensive
ornamental grounds. It is lighted by the electric incan-
descent light, the dynamo being driven by a huge iron water-
wheel. The view from the terrace and tower is one of sur-
passing beauty, nature and science combining to form a
picture of indescribable magnificence. The estate of Native
Point is on the opposite side of the river where the residence
of Mr. W. Gibson, sen., is situated about two miles from Scone.
The greater portion of the stud sheep are depastured at Scone
and Native Point. Some of the runs are partly covered with
ferns and brushwood, rendering the wool grown thereon to
become what is technically known as “ motey,” such class of
wool undergoing a considerable alteration in price. The
rams for sale and the best sheep are kept chiefly in well-
sheltered paddocks of English grass. The Scone merinos
contain a large infusion of Spanish blood, which has been
introduced from time to time, the origin of the flock itself
being pure Spanish. In Part I. of the first volume
of this work we have given an account of the introduc-
tion of sheep into the island, and having also devoted a
separate article to the subject, it will therefore be unnecessary
to recapitulate it. To the merinos of the late James Cox, Esq.,
of Clarendon, who was an enthusiast in sheep-breeding, is due
the origin of the pure flock of James Youl, Esq., of Symmons’
Plains. From this latter gentleman Mr. W. Gibson purchased
privately the whole of his pure ewe lambs—3oo in all —and
these ewes were the commencement of the now well-known
“ Scone merinos.”
The young ewes Mr. Gibson obtained from Mr. Youl were
crossed for three years with pure stud rams, bought from
the late Mr. Daniel Taylor, and bred by him from imported
sheep. At what was then considered a very high price these
rams were purchased, as they were the pick of Mr. Taylor’s
best sheep, and were fine and dense. In 1868, Mr. Wm.
Gibson, jun., visited Europe, and, after personally inspecting
the most noted merino flocks, selected and sent to Tasmania,
at considerable expense, two rams and five ewes from the
celebrated Gadegast flock at Thai, Oschatz, Saxony ; and four
rams from Sturgeon’s (George III.’s) flock. These ewes were
picked out of forty of Mr. Gadegast’s best, and secured by
Mr. Gibson for forty guineas per head. Among those selected
was the ewe Beauty, with which Mr. Gadegast very re-
luctantly parted. Beauty died in 1881, sixteen and a half
years old, and reared a lamb each year she was at Scone, viz.,
ten lambs. The ram Goldmine, and her offspring, was, after
being used for a short period in the stud, sold by auction in
New Zealand for 115 guineas. The Messrs. Gibson hold
certificates of breeding, and full pedigrees of all the imported
sheep. With the exception of two rams, one called Rob, and
the other, the Duke of Richmond, the firm has, for the last
fifteen years, used exclusively choice rams of their own
breeding, such as the following well-known studs and their
sons : —Longwool, The Duke, Royal Duke, Prince 1., Prince
11., Prince 111., Prince of Wales, Prince Albert, &c., &c. In
the Scone sheep the characteristics of the pure merino are
brought to great perfection, which has been increased by a
long period of careful selection and attention. A special
feature of the Scone sheep is that they live to a great age ;
the old ewes continue to grow good fleeces, and rear fine
lambs long after they have been dismissed from the stud for
longevity, and sold to other breeders. The stud flock now
numbers about 1400 young pure ewes, and 3000 special
breeding ewes. From 1878 to 1881, these ewes, after rearing
a lamb, cut over 41bs. of hot-water washed wool, which
realised at the London sales of 1878 over twelve shillings per
head, and in 1880 about eleven shillings.
The Scone sheep have always been very successful in the
show yards wherever exhibited. Messrs. Gibson have not ex-
hibited for some time past, but have always secured a high posi-
tion, very many first and champion prizes having been gained
by them, a full record of these, however, having not been pre-
served. At the wool shows Scone has fully maintained its
reputation, both for price per lb. and value per fleece. At the
exhibition of the Agricultural Society, New South Wales,
held at Sydney, June, 1875, the champion position was
gained, several prizes having been awarded. At the wool ex-
hibition held by Messrs. Hastings Cuningham and Co., Mel-
bourne, in February, 1879, Messrs. Gibson and Son took the
premier position. Messrs. Gibson state that the success of
the American Scone merino is established beyond all doubt,
as the splendid specimens of both rams and ewes now at
Scone of first, second, third, and further crosses emphatically
prove. Any gentlemen taking an interest in merinos can
have the pleasure of inspecting them, or any of the Scone
sheep, between May and September inclusive. Of the many
famous rams in the Scone studs none ranks more highly than
Prince Albert, a wood engraving of which we give. He was
born May, 1883, sire, Prince of Wales (53); dam, a special
ewe by Royal Duke (64). A most perfect ram with a grand
constitution. He was dense, even, pure and good in all
points, and opened with a clear staple of bright soft wool.
He was used heavily in 1885 and 1886, and proved himself a
splendid sire. There are now at Scone some of his sons pos-
sessing all the good qualities of this sire, a few decidedly sur-
passing him. Prince Albert cut at 6-tooth 201bs. of bright
wool, light in grease, having the same season sired over 220
lambs. He was sold at Melbourne in 1886 for 500 guineas.
JOHN B. CURRAN,
Launceston.
It is a well-known fact that Tasmanian wool is of a finer quality,
owing principally to the regularity and evenness of the
climate, than that exported from the Australian colonies,


For this reason the cultivation of the finer grades of sheep is |
studied more than agriculture, and the Tasmanian wool j
selectors have a good reputation in the London market for
their merino and cross-bred wool, and are particular that all
wool shipped under their hand shall come up to the standard.
The special advantages claimed for Tasmanian wool over that of
the other colonies is that it does not contain the fatty matter
and waste, and is free from burr. The washing and scouring of
wool, and the fellmongering of skins, has become an im-
portant branch of business in the colony, and there are a
number of merchants who are engaged in this industry.
Prominent among these is Mr. J. B. Curran, of Launceston, j
who is located about two and a-half miles from the centre of
the town. Mr. Curran makes a specialty of the finer grades
of merino wool, and all the finer grades of wool shipped to j
London marked with his brand J. B. C., command the highest
price in that market, as none but the better grades are marked
with this brand. The purity and softness of the water
of Tasmania assists greatly in washing the staple without
interfering with its life, as all woollen manufacturers can ;
testify. Mr. Curran buys the skins directly from the farmers, !
and after the wool is removed he tans the pelt, which is
shipped in the crust to the London market. The wool is then
classified, and the finer grades, as before mentioned, are
marked with the brand, while the lower grades are particu-
larised according to their quality, and sold.
J. W. SKIN,
Brass Founder and Finisher.
The business was first established in December, 1881, by the
present propi ietor, Mr. J. W. Skin, who was previously connected
with a large manufacturing firm in Melbourne. Mr. Skin
imports to Launceston the crude copper and zinc, and manufac-
tures the brass metal, which enables him to adapt the quality to
the article he wishes to manufacture. The constantly increas-
ing demand for his manufactured goods has compelled him to
extend his business, aud he now contemplates moving into
more commodious quarters, when the increased facilities will
enable him to fill his orders more promptly. Mr. Skin makes
a speciality of engineers’ and plumbers’ brass work, including
steam fittings, and, in fact, every description of brass work
manufactured in the other colonies; and is, at the present
time, the only exclusive brass founder and finisher in Tas-
mania, being the pioneer in this business.
T. BOYD AND CO.,
Boot and Shoe Manufacturers and Tanners.
Me. Bovd commenced manufacturing in a small way in a shop
on Charles-street, Launceston, in 1865. As the business grew
he added to his force until, in 1881, the quarters then occupied
were found to be altogether too small, and Mr. Boyd built the
new and commodious factory in Elizabeth-street. The build-
ing is a large tw’o-story brick structure, eighty feet long by
thirty feet wide, and contains all the improved modem
machinery, which Mr. Boyd has imported expressly for his
own use. Among these may be noted a Blake sole sewer, a
die-cutting machine for cutting out soles, and all the other
machines necessary for manufacturing the best quality of
work. Fifty hands are employed in the factory, principally
skilled workmen; while the younger and more inexperienced
hands find plenty of work in the minor parts. All grades of
work are manufactured in the factory—from a man’s coarse
stock boot to a gent’s fine sewed calf boot and shoe; and in
ladies’ wear, from a cheap kangaroo pegged to a fine sewed
French kid button boot. Mr. Boyd makes a speciality of
the finer grades for both gentlemen’s and ladies’ wear. The
production at the present time is thirty thousand pairs of boots
and shoes per year, though the factory has a capacity of sixty
thousand pairs, which may be still further increased if necessary.
In connection with the factory Mr. Boyd built, in 1877, a
tannery, which has a capacity of 2500 sides leather, and 2500
calf and 14,000 kangaroo skins. The surplus stock was at one
time exported, but at present the factory consumes the entire
production. Mr. Boyd’s business extends to all parts of the
colony of Tasmania, but he has thus far paid no attention to
the export trade. The cost of the factory and tannery is
£IO,OOO.
ACADEMY OF MUSIC,
Launceston.
The Academy of Music was originated by Mr. John C. Hall,
an actor who, during the latter part of 1884, organised a
Stock Company. The sum subscribed was inadequate, and,
owing to the failure of Mr. Hall, the building was left in an
unfinished state for about six months. In September, 1885, a
new company was formed, composed of the former stock-
owners and others, and sufficient capital was obtained to com-
plete the building, the total cost being about £6OOO. The
seating capacity is 800, but 1000 can be accommodated, if
necessary. The stage is fitted with all the modern appliances,
and has a depth of 47 feet. The chairs in the dress circle and
stalls were manufactured in Launceston, and are of the latest
design. The first entertainment was given on February Bth,
1886. Mr. Melville Stack is the Secretary of the Company and
Agent for the Theatre.
NEIL ELLIOT LEWIS, M.A.
Mr. Lewis was born in Hobart, October 27th, 1858. He is the
son of Neil Lewis, Esq. He received his education at the
High School, Hobart. From that school he secured the
Associate of Arts degree, and the gold medal for the year
1875, and in 1877 he secured one of the Tasmanian scholar-
ships. Proceeding to England he entered at Balliol College,
Oxford. He took the degree of B.A. with honors in 1882, and
the degrees of M.A. and B.C.L. in 1885. He was called to the
Bar by the Inner Temple in 1883, and returned to Tasmania
in 1885, and admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of
the colony in December, 1885. In July, 1886, he contested
Richmond for a seat in the House of Assembly, and was
returned by that constituency. He is the Worshipful Master
of the Tasmanian Union Masonic Lodge No. 536, and holds a
commission in the Tasmanian Defence Force,


F. H. CRISP.
Mk. Cmsp was born in Hobart in 1865. He is the second
son of Mr. George Crisp, of Sussex, England, who arrived in
Tasmania about forty years since. Mr. George Crisp at once
commenced business as a timber merchant, and succeeded re-
markably well. In recognition of his services in behalf of the
public, he was made mayor of Hobart for the years 1873-4-5>
and for sixteen years he was a member of the council. He is
deservedly one of the most popular men in the colony, having
upon several occasions been requested to become a member of
Parliament, but declining the honour. Mr. F. H. Crisp is
also engaged in the timber trade. His business premises in
Hobart are large and commodious, and his stock includes all
varieties of timber. He gives his personal attention to the
trade, and consequently pleases his very numerous customers.
Mr. George Crisp married, at the age of 21, the eldest
daughter of W. Dawson, of England, by whom he had eight
children, seven of whom survive. His wife died in 1874, and
four years later he married Miss Burgess, daughter of W. H.
Burgess, Esq., by whom he has had three children.
Mr. F. H. Crisp was educated at Mr. Pike’s city school.
H. B. HURBURGH.
Me. Hcebuegh served his apprenticeship with his brother-
in-law, T. R. M'Cristy, Esq.; but the latter died before Mr.
Hurburgh’s time had expired, who for a time conducted the
business for his sister. He then joined Mr. Gough in 1880,
commencing practice in Collins-street, afterwards removing
to Liverpool-street, where they have built up an extensive
and lucrative practice, due primarily to the fact that they are
skilled workmen. Mr. Hurburgh has secured all the most
approved and latest appliances from London and America,
and is conversant with the latest discoveries in his profes-
sion. He married, in 1879, the eldest daughter of Mr. Joshua
Moore, of Hobart.
JAMES HARRIS.
Me. Hakris was born in New South Wales. He is the second
son of James Harris, Esq., of England. He received his
education in New South Wales, and at the age of thirteen
came to Hobart, where he learned the cabinet-making trade
and remained for six years. He removed to New Zealand
and continued the business for eight years, returning to
Hobart in 1870, where he commenced business. Subsequently
he joined the Garden Island Creek Saw Mill Company, which
connection he still retains. He married, in 1873, the youngest
daughter of Mr. Smith, of Hobart, by whom he has had eight
children, seven of whom are living. Mr. Harris now manages
the town business of the Garden Island Saw Mill Company,
which, under the control of Messrs. Ford and Harris, has
prospered exceedingly. The retail timber-yard of the com-
pany is located in Elizabeth street, Hobart. It was estab-
lished in 1870 by Messrs. Ford and Harris. The trade is very
extensive, and includes export to all the Australasian colonies.
The mills are celebrated for blue-gum timber, which is sup- ;
plied largely for bridge and railway purposes in all the colo- :
nies. The output of the mills is about 40,000 feet per week.
They employ from twenty-five to thirty hands, paying weekly
wages from £55 to £OO. The timber is the very best pro-
duced in the colony, and commands a large Tasmanian trade.
Mr. Ford is a member of the Masonic order, and a gentleman
well known for his energy and business habits.
EXCELSIOR BOOT FACTORY,
A. F. Ray, Proprietor.
The Excelsior Boot Factory is situated in Liverpool-street,
Hobart, and is conducted by Mr. A. F. Bay. This factory
gives employment to over 30 hands. Trade is carried on with
all parts of the colony. Mr. Ray is a native of Hobart, and at
the age of 21 commenced the business, which he has conducted
with such success. In the manufacture of his goods he im-
ports leather very largely from the foreign markets, while at
the same time he makes a speciality of Tasmanian kangaroo.
The factory is fitted up with all the latest improved
machinery, and includes sewing machines, rollers, sole sew-
ing machine, and all the other inventions found only in a
first-class manufactory. The sample room fronting on
Liverpool-street is well fitted up and replete with samples of
foot wear of almost every description. The goods have
acquired a well-merited reputation, and find a ready sale where
they are best known.
KENNETH MUNRO.
Kenneth Muneo, born in Hobart in the year 1840, is the
fourth son of Donald Munro, of Rosshire, Scotland. Mr.
Donald Munro came to the colony about the year 1855, he
being engaged at home to come out and take the management
of the late Henry Davidson’s saw-mill (now Clark’s), and is
still closely connected with the firm. The subject of this
sketch went to serve his time to the turning trade at the age
of eleven, and at eighteen had business premises of his own,
situated at 105 Melville street, Hobart, where he still resides.
Mr. Munro employs three hands the year round, and is doing
a flourishing trade, he being the first to introduce steam-
power for the sole purpose of turning wood, &c., &c., in Tas-
mania. Mr. Munro is a member of the Freemason’s Lodge
345 1.C., and takes a great interest in all things pertaining to
that order. He also is a Rechabite, and occupies the position
of district deputy ruler. Mr. Munro is a member of the Gar-
rison band, and as for music, Mr. Munro is full of it. He also
is a member of the Philharmonic Society, and is one of the
trustees. He plays the solo clarion in the Orchestral Union,
which is acknowledged to be the best band in Tasmania. Mr.
Munro is an active politician, and was a member of the Trades
Council until 1884, and was one of those whose efforts were the
cause of abolishing the restriction clause in our electoral Act
by the agitation conducted by the working classes in that year
for the extension of the franchise. He also is a member of
the Southern Tasmanian Political Association, and was one
of the council which has brought out several really good
men.


THE ST. JOHN’S MASONIC LODGE,
Launceston. Irish Constitution.
The first meeting held for the purpose of organizing a lodge
was in October, 1842, but the lodge was not opened until
January 9th, 1843. The first meeting was held in the Kan-
garoo Inn; but the lodge was afterwards held at the Caledo-
nian Inn. In September, 1852, the Hope Lodge was opened
under the English Constitution, at the lodge room belonging
to the former lodge in St. John-street. In August, 1876, St.
Andrew’s Lodge was opened under the Scotch Constitution.
In consequence of the growth of the order it was found neces-
sary to procure more commodious quarters, and in February
1880, a meeting of a few of the leading Masons was held, and
it was decided to purchase an allotment of ground in Bris-
bane-street, and erect a suitable building, Thirty-one mem-
bers subscribed £5 each, and bound themselves to an annual
payment for 10 years to complete the purchase of the land.
In 1881 a company with a capital stock of £3,500 was organ-
ized, and the land was secured. On the 10th October, 1882,
the specifications of Mr. W. H. Conway were accepted, and the
building soon commenced by Mr. James Hill, contractor.
The lodge opened with dedication ceremonies on the 15th of
October, 1884.
R. NEWEY,
Launceston.
Mr. E. Newev established himself in business, making a
speciality of hay, corn, and general produce. In the early
days, when all communication with England was by sailing
ships and the voyages were from four to six months in length,
large supplies were necessary, and Mr. Newey paid special
attention to fitting out vessels leaving the port of Launceston.
Another important branch of the trade was supplying dealers,
both in the town of Launceston as well as the surrounding
country towns in Northern Tasmania. Mr. Newey was the
first produce dealer to employ steam power for cutting and
bagging chaff, and to-day has the largest plant in the colony.
At first only a small hand-cutting machine was required, but
as the business increased a small steam engine was pur-
chased, which answered the purpose for a number of years,
when it was found to be inadequate for the constantly
increasing business, and a much larger engine was im-
ported direct from England. In 1878 or ’79, finding that cer-
tain varieties of seeds were required, Mr. Newey imported a
small stock from the European countries, thus laying the
foundation for the present large and flourishing seed business.
As the climate of Tasmania is mild, and the variation between
summer and winter not being very great, nearly all the varieties
of both flowers and vegetables thrive well on the Island. This
business has been gradually increasing until, in 1887, the firm
were carrying the largest and best assorted stock in Northern
Tasmania. In January, 1888, Mr. E. Newey, senr., retired in
favour of his sons, Mr. E. Newey and Mr. C. J. Newey, the
business now being carried on under the style of E. Newey and
Sons.
MESSRS. J. C. TOLMAN AND SONS.
Mr. W. W. Tolman is a native of Tasmania, being the eldest
son of the late J. C. Tolman, of England. He was educated
in the colony, and joined his father in the coal and wood
business in 1859, and with him remained until the death of
his father, in 1873. Employment is given to eight hands,
steam power is used, including circular saws, and all the best
appliances, at their premises, 27 Old Market, Hobart. The
coal business is conducted at Morrison street. Mr Tolman
married, in 1865, the only daughter of Mr. F. H. Shaw, of
Hobart, and has been blessed with seven children, five of
whom are living. The business is old established, and com-
mands the confidence of a large number of customers, who
appreciate fair and honorable dealing.
WHITSIDES AND SON,
General Furnishers, Warehousemen and
Importers.
The business was established by Mr. James Whitsides in
1834, in Argyle street, Hobart, but afterwards removed to
Liverpool street, where the business is still carried on. The
senior member of the firm, Mr. J. Whitsides, takes a deep
interest in public affairs, but at the same time carefully
supervises his business. Mr. T. Whitsides, the junior member
of the firm, is a prominent member of the Masonic order.
The business premises, situated in Liverpool street, are the
most extensive of the kind in Tasmania, having a frontage of
64 feet by a depth of 250 feet. The furniture factory is fitted
with all the latest improvements, and the style and quality of
the goods turned out compares favourably with the best
imported from England or America. Labour saving machinery
is extensively employed, while all the superior foreign and
native woods are used. Tasmania has just reason for being
proud of such an establishment, the very existence of which
proves conclusively that customers who are desirous of
securing the very best can obtain it from Messrs. Whitsides
and Son. Two brothers of Mr. T. Whitsides are employed in
the business.
JOHN T. FARMILO.
In a new country the first thing that the fresh arrival
thinks out is where he shall live. He must have a house
of some description, and if he cannot find a suitable one he
must obtain the services of a builder. The builder, there-
fore, is an important factor in a new country, where in
early days the modest houses were built, which, in course
of time, are pulled down, and on the same site magnificent
structures are erected. One of the builders and contractors
in this new country is the subject of this sketch, who arrived
in Launceston in 1878, where, after remaining one year, he
established a business for himself. Since that time he has
erected a number of the leading buildings in the city,
among which is the Memorial Church, Barclay’s Block,
and he has the contract for the new Coffee Palace, which
is t« be located in Charles street.

Hon.Thos.Reibey


HON. THOMAS REIBEY, M. A.,
Speaker of the House of Assembly.
Manx of the early pioneers of the island of Tasmania—
some of whom are still living—have been instrumental in
giving a tone to society by their labours, be they physical or
mental. Indeed, not a few have by a continuation of the two
spheres of toil rendered good service to the colony of their birth
or adoption. We select as a proof of the assertion the name of
the Hon. Thomas Reibey who is a native of Tasmania. When
a boy he was sent to England for the purpose of obtaining his
education, and first entered a public school, but subsequently
was placed under the charge of a private tutor, who prepared
him for matriculation at Trinity College, Oxford. Not having
acquired the prescribed age for ordination before leaving Eng-
land, in 1843, for Tasmania, he brought out letters dismissory
from Dr. Philpotts, Bishop of Exeter, to Bishop Nixon, and in
the latter part of 1844 was ordained Deacon. Mr. Reibey formed
the parish of Garrick, and there built a church which he
partly endowed, declining to receive any stipend for his ser-
vices. In 1855, Bishop Nixon requested him to accept the
position of Archdeacon of Launceston, but he declined, since
it would compel him to relinquish many pastimes which he
enjoyed, such as hunting, shooting and fishing. However, at
the urgent request of the Bishop, who expressed a wish to have
a man on whose business habits and integrity of character he
could rely, Mr. Reibey decided to accept the offer, at the same
time working as before without a stipend. This position he
held for twelve years, when he resigned, and for the next three
years remained in perfect retirement, never once leaving his
Estate. During this period, he refused urgent requests to
stand for three constituencies, Norfolk Plains and South
Launceston, being amongst the number. When Mr. John Miller
resigned his seat for Westbury in 1874, pressure was
brought to bear on Mr. Reibey to represent that electorate, but
he was reluctant to accept the invitation, until it was intimated
to him by his friend, the late Hon. Charles Meredith, that it
was commonly reported that he was afraid to come out. “If
that is the case,” said Mr. Reibey, “ then you can nominate me.”
The result was that he was nominated and returned by the
third or fourth largest constituency in Tasmania without op-
position and took his seat in the opposition to the Kennelly
Ministry, then in power—the Hon. F. W. Innes being leader
of Mr. Reibey’s party, and by that gentleman was induced to act
as Secretary of the Opposition. On Mr. Innes’ resignation, Mr.
Reibey was elected as Leader, and held that position until 1876,
the year in which the Kennelly Ministry resigned. Having
been sent for by the Governor, Sir Frederick Wells, on July
20th, of the same year, Mr. Reibey formed an adminstration
and remained in office as Premier and Chief Secretary until
August 9th, 1877, during which period he gave much atten-
tion to the penal establishments, and broke up Port Arthur, a
place which had gained an unenviable notoriety. The Reibey
Ministry was succeeded by the Fysh and Giblin Ministry,
which remained in power until September, 1878. During this
time Mr. Reibey acted as Leader of the Opposition, and in
December of the same year he moved a vote of want of con-
fidence in the existing Ministry. The motion having been
carried, Sir Frederick Wells again sent for the subject of this
sketch, but he not wishing to take office, proposed a Ministry
which the Governor declined to accept, unless Mr. Reibey
would occupy the post of Chief Secretary, positively
declined the office of Premier, feeling that that position was
due to his old friend, Mr. Crowther. This Ministry remained
in office until October 30th, 1879, when Mr. Giblin formed
his famous coalition Ministry, Mr. Reibey remaining as mem-
ber for Westbury, and always occupying a seat on the Opposi-
tion benches, and was to some extent the Loader of that side
of the House, until he deemed it prudent for the best interests
of the country to follow the leadership of the Hon. Alfred
Dobson, and then that of the Hon. E. C. Braddon. Although
sitting on the Opposition benches, he reserved to himself the
right of supporting the Ministry of the day, in carrying out
many measures tending to make Tasmania a more desirable
country, such as the reduction of taxations on all the chief
necessaries of life, especially the tax on meat, tea, and sugar,
and whatever would further the reciprocity of trade between
the Australian Colonies. During the time that Mr. Reibey
was Premier, the famous Hunt case arose. Hunt was a woman
of German birth, advanced in years, and kept a lodging-house
in Hobart. She, together with her son, a lad under twenty
years of age, who was alleged to be an accomplice, was arrested
on the charge of having set fire to the house, which was burned
down, and both were lodged in gaol. A petition was drawn
up during the Kennelly Ministry, and signed by members of
Parliament, and many influential citizens of Hobart praying
that the boy’s sentence be remitted. It was sent to the
Governor, and although it was firmly believed that the mother
was entirely under the influence of her son, a pardon was
granted. In 1876, during Mr. Reibey’s Premiership, a petition
signed by members of Parliament and others praying for the
mother’s release, was forwarded to the Governor who handed
it to Mr. Reibey. The petition having been considered by Mr.
Reibey in Cabinet Council as well as at the Executive meeting
which followed ; and every member being in favour of a re-
mission of sentence, the Governor being strictly in accord
with these views, the woman was pardoned. When the matter
came before Parliament the Riebey Government was censured
for having advised the pardon, but Mr. Reibey in defence of
his action, made a short and graphic speech. He said, “ I did
advise the remission of Mrs. Hunt’s sentence, because I never
believed in her guilt, and with such a belief would have been
worthy of execution if I had not advised as I did, and I would
give the same advice again to-morrow.” In 1876 when Mr.
Reibey accepted the office of Premier, he discovered there
were five gaols in Tasmania, Port Arthur, Launceston, and
Campbell Street, Hobart, having one each, and the Cascades
two; the population of the colony at that time being only
100,000. It appeared to him that such expenditure was un-
necessary and unjustifiable, ardhe accordingly made an agree-
ment with his colleagues that he should be permitted to con-
centrate these establishments, and abolish Port Arthur. His
reason for taking this important step was that as Chaplain of
the gaol in Launceston, he had gained some experience in
the management of penal establishments in Tasmania, since
during the administration of Sir Wm. Denison, he had at the
Governor’s request, been sent privately by Bishop Nixon to
visit the establishments of Port Arthur and report upon iti


condition. He was so thoroughly convinced of the barbarous
cruelty exercised by the oflicers placed in charge over the
unfortunate criminals, that he was determined, whenever he
had the power, to use every effort to break up an establish-
ment so far distant from the Central Government and where
proper supervision by the public could not exist. The officers
in charge could indulge in the most cruel treatment of convicts
without fear of detection or exposure. Many years before Mr.
Reibey took office, the Parliament of Tasmania passed a re-
solution to the effect that Port Arthur should be abolished,
and after having accepted the position of Premier, Mr. Reibey
conceived it to be his duty to carry out a resolution which bis
predecessors had failed to execute. He visited the settlement
in December, 1876, in company with Sir Frederick Wells,
the Attorney General, and the Minister of Lands and Works,
and spent three days in an inspection of the gaols and
lunatic asylum, at the same time listening to the complaints
of the inmates of these institutions. On December 14th., his
reply to the question of Sir Frederick Wells, “What do you
propose to do with Port Arthur? ” was “Break it up, Sir Fred-
erick,” whereupon the Governor said, “Thank God; but
have you the courage to do it, and what will Parliament say? ”
Mr. Reibey’s reply to this question was characteristic. “I do
not care what Parliament may say, for before that body meets,
Sir Frederick, there will not be a prisoner in Port Arthur, and
if on the first day that Parliament assembles, I am turned out of
office, I shall be ever grateful that I have been instrumental
in breaking up that ‘ Hell on Earth.’ ” Within three months
from the date of this conversation, the prisoners and lunatics
were removed to Hobart, and the name of Port Arthur changed
to Carnarvon. Since the year 1879 Mr. Reibey has retained a
seat in the House of Assembly. When not in office he has always
sat on the Opposition benches either as Leader or under the
leadership of the Hon. F. M., and the Hons. Alfred Dobson
and Braddon. Mr. Reibey has been elected five times by the
large and influential constituency of Westbury without opposi.
tion, and in July, 1887, was unanimously chosen to occupy
the office of Speaker of the House of Assembly.
JAMES FENTON, ESQ.,
Author of “ The History of Tasmania.”
Mr. James Fenton, author of the History of Tasmania, and
other works, is the fourth and only surviving son of a gentle-
man of the same name, who was a large landholder, and
captain in the local miltia, in the county of Wicklow, Ireland.
He was born on the 20th November, 1820, at the village of
Dunlavin, in that county, and received a few years’ education
at Elton boarding school, near the Vale of Avoca, a large
scholastic institution conducted by the Rev. William Wesley
Harris, M.A., with the assistance of classical and other
masters. It was here that the subject of this notice
acquired his first taste for the study of literature. He had
relatives residing near the school, with whose friends the
national poet, Thomas Moore, occasionally stayed. In this
rural retreat the bard composed his beautiful melody, entitled
“The Meeting of the Waters”; and, although only
twelve years of age, the young schoolboy took every
available opportunity of studying the Irish melodies, and
Moore’s other productions. At about this period in his life he
was called home, with his brothers, preparatory to the removal
of the family to Tasmania. The disturbed condition of Ire-
land had been a continual source of trouble to his father’s
mind—not on account of any unfriendly relations between
himself and the people, for he was beloved by the peasantry
around- but he was always dreading an outbreak, and a
repetition of the unhappy scenes of 1798. At length he decided
to sell out his landed interests, gather all his property,
which was considerable, into a small compass, and leave his
native country.
Accordingly, in September, 1833, Mr. Fenton’s father, with
his family, went on board one of the clumsily-constructed paddle
steamers of those days at the Black Rock, crossed over to
Liverpool, and sailed in an emigrant ship for Hobart Town.
There were the father, mother, three girls, three boys (five of
the family were grown up), a lady niece and a male and female
servant. At that period the passage was, under the most
favourable circumstances, tedious, and the best accommoda-
tion and fare were inferior. The greatest misfortune which
visited the voyagers was the death of the parental head of the
family ere the vessel was out of sight of the home country.
The sad event was caused by violent sea-sickness, which pro-
duced inflammation. His remains were committed to the
deep in the stormy Bay of Biscay, and the bereaved ones were
hurried on to the opposite side of the world, where, in a
strange land, they would have to seek their fortunes without
the care and guidance of their natural protector. A series of
mishaps occurred during the voyage. The ship was nearly
wrecked one night on one of the Cape de Yerde Islands, but
she got out from amongst the rocks and foaming billows in
an almost miraculous manner. When she was three degrees
nortn of the Equator a squall carried away the fore and main-
masts by the deck, and the top spars of the mizen-mast.
Fortunately there was a calm sea, or the debris from the
wreck clinging to the shattered bulwark would have sunk the
ship. Jury masts were rigged, moderate weather prevailed,
and the crippled vessel’s course was turned for Rio Janeiro,
the capital of Brazil, two thousand miles distant. This
part of the voyage was one of painful anxiety to
all on board, for the temporary spars, upon which a scanty
supply of canvas bore the ship slowly along, were liable to
be carried away with less than half a gale, in which case
about 300 passengers and the crew would probably have been
unshipped without a moment’s warning. In those days the
old-fashioned merchantman carried several guns, and a
quantity of small arms, as a protection against the pirates
which infested the seas between Africa and South America.
Fortunately, the ship was well provided with these, and all
requisite munitions of warfare; for, one day, south of the
Line, a rakish-looking, fast-sailing schooner ran down upon
her, clearly with the intention of seizing her as a prize. The
number of people on board the dismasted ship, and the reso-
lute attitude they presented on the deck, even the women
from amongst the steerage passengers being clad in male
attire, and all hands bearing a musket or some sort of weapon,
intimidated the pirate before she attempted an attack, so that
after sailing several times round the ship, beating to and fro


all day in a manner which betrayed her indecision, and
causing indescribable consternation, she made off before the
breeze in the evening, whereupon the ship’s guns thundered
forth a defiant volley, and quiet prevailed once more. Seven
weeks were spent at the Brazilian capital, during which time
the ship was completely overhauled, and newly rigged. The
subject of this memoir, then 13 years of age, improved the
opportunity of his stay at Rio by visiting, in company with
his elder brothers, all the public places in and round the city,
the ships of many nations in the spacious harbour, the gor-
geous churches and cathedrals during high masses and
devotional celebrations, the imposing burial services, and the
curious chambers set apart as receptacles for the remains of
the illustrious dead. The ship was still in harbour on the
Emperor’s birthday (December 2, 1833). Pedro 11. was
a youth eight years old at that time. The boys were
permitted, as English visitors, to enter the palace
and observe many of the ceremonies which took
place on that occasion. When the ship reached her destina-
tion, a relative of the Fenton family went on board, and ac-
companied them on shore. The ten passengers, clad in deep
mourning, proceeded from the wharf to the Derwent Hotel,
where they remained for a short time. The subject of our
notice was sent first to Mr. James Thomson’s school, and
when the family removed to the country he became a boarder
at Mr. Giblin’s school, New Town. At the age of seventeen
Mr. Fenton went to reside with a brother-in-law at Middle
Plain, in the district of Deloraine. At that time (1837) there
was no road from Launceston to Deloraine, except a bush
track through the forest and marshes, which was impassable
for bullock teams in the winter. There was only one person
living in a cottage where the town of Deloraine now stands.
Nearly the whole country was an unfenced cattle run, and Mr.
William Field claimed all the wild cattle for thirty miles
round. Mr. Fenton took part in the first clearing, ploughing
and reaping at Middle Plain. He was in the habit of scatter-
ing clover seed as he rode through the bush and marshy
places ; the result was that in a few years the country in every
direction was covered with clover. In 1839 Mr. Fenton re-
moved to Port Sorell, where he cultivated some land on the
eastern side of the water. Again, in March, 1840, at the age
of twenty, he removed to and finally settled down at the
River Forth, where he had purchased two blocks of land of
320 and 640 acres each. In those days the only lands consi-
dered worth purchasing at the upset price of ss. per acre were
the open plains and pasture lands. Mr. Fenton made a
departure from the general rule by purchasing the large
block, which was all forest land; but upon the 320-acre block
there was a clear marsh of 100 acres or more, which he put
into cultivation; but the land was saturated with the salt
tide waters of the river, and refused to yield a crop. After
spending a considerable sum of money in banking out the
water, he had to give up the marsh, and commence clearing
the forest land at the back. This would have
been a very formidable undertaking under the system
of clearing which was practiced in the colony at
that time ; but Mr. Fenton considered that what was
done in the United States might be done in Tas-
mania; so he had the larger trees ring-barked, and the
smaller ones grubbed up and burned—not felled as now, and
burned off without handling. This was rather costly work,
although convict servants were to be had for their rations and
clothing. When Mr. Fenton went to the Forth there was
not another settler in the district of West Devon, which is
now the most densely populated part of the island outside the
two cities. There were no roads. The nearest post-office
was at Westbury, some eighty miles distant, and there, toe,
was the nearest police office. Bushrangers were not uncom-
mon visitors in those days. On one occasion he came across
two notorious outlaws on the beach. They had escaped with
a boat, but the weather being rough, were driven on the rocks
at the Forth, and the boat was broken up. He took the men
to a little vessel which was lying in the port ready for sea.
The men evidently expected that they could procure another
boat. The master of the vessel was a shrewd fellow, who held
the indulgence of a “ ticket-of-leave.” He promised the
bushrangers that he would take them to Port ..Phillip, but his
real intention was to deliver them up to the authorities in
Launceston. When they were out at sea he succeeded, with
his two sailors, in securing them under hatches. For this
service the master of the little craft got a free pardon. He
was a man of wonderful tact in the art of money-making. He
purchased some land in the district, and in a very few years
amassed a considerable fortune. On another occasion three
men from the ultra-penal settlement of Port Arthur entered
the river in a boat which they had stolen. They were well
armed. It was Sunday, and one of Mr. Fenton’s servants
had strolled down to the Heads for pastime, when he observed
the boat and its crew coming over the bar. On approaching
nearer he recognised the men. They had been doing sentence
together at Port Arthur. They persuaded the man, whose
name was Billy Rowe, to accompany them to Port Phillip (as
they said) in the boat, and pulled out again to sea, their new
companion having informed them that there was only
one young settler at the Forth, and that he knew
of better game along the coast to the westward.
They next appeared at Woolworth, where they com-
mitted a robbery under arms, tied up the storekeeper,
threatened to shoot him if he moved, and went away loaded
with provisions, etc. They reached Port Phillip, landed
somewhere between Point Napier and Western Port,
travelled overland to Melbourne, where two of them engaged
to work their passages on board a ship bound to England,
and thus got clear away. The other two were apprehended
and sent back to Tasmania. Landing at Georgetown to
undergo a preliminary trial for stealing the boat, they were
forwarded on to Launceston under escort. The first nigh
they were lodged in the Mount Direction police station.
Handcuffed together, they had a bed on the floor, two
constables keeping watch. At about midnight they made
a rush for the door, seized a knife from the table as they
ran, and in the darkness of the night escaped the fire and
pursuit of the police. A day and night were occupied by the
runaways in filing off their handcuffs with the knife, the edge
of which they serrated for the purpose. They next pro-
ceeded to rob a shepherd’s hut of clothing and provisions;
then made their way back to Georgetown, where under
cover of the night, they stole Pilot Foster’s boat, oars, and


sails, and proceeded at once to the River Leven, which was
an unfrequented place, without an inhabitant. Here they
left their boat safe in the little inlet which lies close to the
eastern end of the present bridge, and went across to Mr.
Fenton’s house at the Forth, in order to procure a supply of
provisions. The following is his narrative of the interview,
“ One night, at about 11 o’clock, I was sitting alone beside
my tallow candle, reading a book on astronomy, when my
attention was called from heaven to earth by the sudden
opening of the outer door, when a wild-looking man, with
rough, unshaven face (uncommon in those days) stood before
me. My first thought was—bushrangers, and perhaps
murder—for it was a maxim among outlaws that ‘ the dead
don’t speak.’ My man had gone to his hut, and was doubt-
less fast asleep with the other servants, so I resolved to
make the best of it. At this moment the bushranger
exclaimed ‘ Master! ’ with a look of recognition. Recog-
nising the voice, I replied—‘ What 1 is it you, Billy Rowe ?
I expected you were either free or hanged by this time.’
4 No, Master,’ he said, 4 they brought two of us back, and
we have a boat but no provisions to carry us back to Port
Phillip—l thought, Master, you would give us some tucker.’
‘Where is your mate?’l enquired. ‘Outside, sir.’ ‘Call
him in.’ ‘No sir, I shall not allow a bushranger to cross your
threshold. We have come to beg for help, not to extort it.’
‘ And are you not a fool to leave a good place when your
ticket-of-leave was just about to be granted, thus to risk your
life, and plunge into such a wretched state of existence ? ’
‘ Yes, sir, yes,’ and the poor fellow wept aloud, ‘ I would
surrender if they would only spare my life.’ ‘ But they will
be sure to hang you (I said) for that robbery-under-arms, and
the horrible record of your life-long offences before you came
to me.’ I must confess that I did not want to hear of the
unfortunate man receiving capital punishment, for he had
some good points. All he wanted was freedom. ‘ Now (I
said) go to work, Bill, and help yourself, while I hold the
candle.’ ‘Never, sir, I shall take nothing unless you give it.'
I explained that I dare not supply a bushranger without
incurring a heavy penalty, and that in the morning I would
have to report his visit. At last he proceeded very delicately
to take what he required for the voyage, weeping at intervals,
and crying, ‘ Master, master, what would I give to be back
again with you.’ They went off with their swag, and pulled
out of the Leven before daylight. Next day they were driven
out of their course, sought refuge at Flinders Island, where
the black settlement then was. There they were taken
prisoners, and sent to Launceston. I saw them tried after-
wards, and sentenced to be hanged.”
During the first few years Mr. Fenton had to endure great
hardships at the Forth. When he went there he had to clear
thirteen miles of road to the Mersey, at Frogmore, where
there was one settler, and on his first visit to the Forth he
had to construct a canoe to cross the river. Sometimes he
travelled on foot to Launceston, and encountered many risks
in crossing the flooded rivers. There was not one inhabitant
from Frogmore to the Mersey Heads, where sometimes he had
to lie by a fire all night, in the absence of a boat to cross him
over the river at Formby. With the discovery of coal at the
Don and Tarleton, population began to flow towards the
north coast, and many families settled on the fine agricultural
lands of West Devon. In 1854 a post-office was established
near Port Sorell, some 25 miles from the Forth, and about the
same period a Cross and Bye Roads Act was passed; trustees
were elected, and rates levied. Mr. Fenton took an active
part in laying out the roads of the district. He was a member,
and chairman of the Road Trust for many years; and in 18G5
was chairman of the Local Board of Works, whose members
were nominated by the Governor-in-Council. He held this
appointment until the Board was dissolved ten years later.
Bridges were constructed for the first time over the Forth and
Mersey. Roads were surveyed and cleared to Deloraine, and
different parts of the district. In 1856 Mr. Fenton was ap-
pointed a territorial justice of the peace, at which time a
police office was established at the Mersey. He was also a
member of the Mersey Marine Board. In 1879 he left the
North Coast to reside in Launceston, where he still lives. In
1846 Mr. Fenton married the daughter of the late T. Monds,
a colonist of 1822. He has three daughters, two of whom are
married, and one son—C. B. M. Fenton, who is a large landed
proprietor at Table Cape—who represents Wellington in the
House of Assembly. Mr. Fenton has been an occasional
contributor to the Tasmanian newspapers for the last 52
years. He has written for the leading columns of the Laun-
ceston Daily Telegraph ever since its establishment, in 1881.
In 1884, he published his History of Tasmania, and in 1886
he compiled a very interesting volume, the life of his pastor,
the Rev. Charles Price, which was published by George
Robertson and Co.
THE VERY REV. DEAN BEECHINOR,
Launceston.
Thu subject of this sketch was born in Cork, Ireland, and
was educated at St. Patrick’s College, Carlow. This college
was established in 1793, and its graduates are to be found in
all quarters of the globe. Amongst the graduates of this well-
known college were the Most Rev. James Doyle, Bishop of
Kildare and Leighlin, better known by the noin deplume of J.
K. L., and also the famous Rev. T. Therry, the father of the
Roman Catholic Church in Australia. Dean Beechinor passe 1
six years of his boyhood at the above institution, which is in-
corporated by Royal Charter with the University of London,
and in consequence of its superior training its graduates are
fitted for any position, lay or clerical. Having devoted him-
self to English, classical, and philosophical studies for some
time, he found himself attracted towards church work, and
although he might have completed his ecclesiastical studies
at Carlow, he determined to draw his inspiration from the
fountain head, and accordingly set out for Rome, where he
entered that famous institution, the Propaganda College, and
commenced in earnest the study of theology, Scripture, and
Canon Law. He was ordained priest in May, 1863, by the
late Most Eminent and Most Illustrious Cardinal Patrizzi, at
that time Vicar-General to the late Pope Pius IX. The
ordination services were held in the Cathedral Church (St.
John Latern), in which Constantine the Great received the
waters of baptism. In June, 1863, he left Rome to return to
his native land, after a collegiate career of eleven years.


Under the Episcopate of the late Cardinal Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr. Cullen, he gave his early services to that diocese, chiefly
in the city of Dublin. Upon the occasion of the present Ven.
Bishop Murphy’s transfer from the See of Hyderabad, Madras
Presidency, India, to the See of Hobart, during the early part
of 1886, the Dean severed his connection with Ireland, and
accepted an invitation to Tasmania. He formed one of the
large party on the ship “ Empress,” destined for different
parts of the Australian colonies, which had in charge the first
Sisterhood of the Presentation Order, which came to the
Southern Hemisphere. On his arrival he was appointed to
the suburban but extensive mission of Richmond, which is
now in charge of three priests.
In Richmond he remained two years when he was given the
charge of St. Mary’s Church, Hobart, where he discharged the
duties of Chaplain, Bishop’s Secretary, and Administrator for
many years. Few in Australia have not heard of the calamity
to the Hobart Cathedral, which, after an existence of less than
ten years, was found to be in an unsafe ccndition, and had to
be pulled down. The Dean was chosen by the Bishop to
solicit funds to re-build the same. He travelled extensively
in New South Wales and Queensland during 18 months, and it
was chiefly through his efforts that the Bishop was enabled to
re-build the premier ecclesiastical structure of Tasmania, After
his return to Hobart he was engaged in educational projects,
establishing primary schools and superintending the higher
schools within his jurisdiction. On the death of the Very
Rev. Dean Butler, in 1881, by the advice of the Episcopal
Council, he was selected to fill the vacancy, and was appointed
to the charge of the important mission of Launceston, and
promoted to the dignity of Dean of Northern Tasmania.
His work in Launceston is similar to that which engaged
his attention in Hobart, namely, building churches, and
establishing schools in Launceston, and the outlying districts
of his mission. When the present Cardinal-Archbishop of
Sydney, in his capacity of delegate Apostolic, convoked the
National Synod of Australia, held in St. Mary’s Cathedral,
Sydney, in November, 1885, Dean Beeehmor attended his
Bishop as theologian. The Dean was one of the three
selected by the vote of the bishops for the recently-created
Bishopric of Gippsland, of which Sale is the ecclesiastical
capital. He also gave important evidence before the Royal
Commission appointed by the Government of Tasmania, to
enquire into the Roman Catholic educational grievances.
Fully appreciating the importance of combining secular and
religious education, the Dean has spared no efforts to establish
schools in connection with the church, and during the past
few years the attendance has increased to a gratifying extent.
The teaching is of such a high class character that the pupils
are able to compete successfully with those educated under the
public secular system; and this success is, in a very great
measure, due to the efforts of the Dean, who is of a cheerful
disposition, and generous to a fault. His energies are devoted
to the development of practical Catholic life among the members
of his flock. This course has earned for him the respect of all—
whose respect is of any value—-and the universal wish is that
he may long be spared to discharge his important duties.
On the sth of August, 1888, was celebrated the jubilee of
the Dean, it being the completion of the 25th year of his
service in the priesthood. Many valuable gifts were pre-
sented, and numberless were the congratulations from his
friends in all parts of the colony.
WOOL.
; Ik other portions of this work attention has been called to this
most important industry, but as our readers may wish to have
a history of wool in a separate chapter so as to save them the
trouble of collecting the facts together, a small portion of our
j space will be specially devoted to the subject. Sheep were
| first introduced into the colony by Colonel Paterson, in the
' year 1817, and were a mixture of the Teeminster, Leicester,
| and Bengal breeds, subsequently being improved from impor-
tations by the Tasmanian Government. Three hundred
merino lambs were obtained from Captain John Macarthur,
! who flocks were located on the banks of the Nepean River at
a place known as the *• low pastures.” This first shipment
was attended with disastrous results, more than one-third
dying on the voyage, whilst the remainder were distributed
among the settlers by lot, each settler engaging to pay the
value of £75 per head. Captain Macarthur received 4,368
| acres of land, valued at 7s. 6d. per acre, as payment for the
I lambs. Later on the Van Diemen’s Land Co. imported a
higher class of sheep, which were followed by other importa-
tions. It was not, however, until 1819 that Tasmanian wool
became an article of export, when the Captain of the
“ Regalia ” accepted a portion of it in exchange for merchan-
I disc. The wool had no market price in Tasmania, owing to
1 the expenses of conveying it to England being enormous—a
duty of 3d. per lb. being levied on the arrival of the shipment
| at London. A sample of the wool was seen in London by Mr.
; Henry Hopkins, but it was in the worst possible condition,
: and the venture, consequently, proved a failure. The Tas-
' manian Government afterwards bought several tons of wool
| for mattresses at the rate of 3d. per lb. Mr. Henry Hopkins
may be considered as the first merchant who brought the
! export of Tasmanian wool to a successful issue, since, in 1821,
| he advertised that he would purchase at 4d. per lb., which he
j accordingly did and shipped twelve bales, this being the entire
l export of the colony for that year. It was sold in London for
£BB, or at the rate of 7d. per lb., the expenses being nearly
j one-half that sum. On January 26, 1822, the following
advertisement appeared in the Hobart Town Gazette and Van
Diemen’s Land Advertiser “ Mr. Joshua Ferguson is collect-
ing wool for the London Market, and will receive the same at
3d. per lb. if clean and clear of water. Rolled up in fleece at 4d.
I per lb.” On April 27,1822, the “ Royal George ” sailed from
Hobart Town for London, having on board 129 bales. The
Hobart Town Gazette of April 27, 1822, says “ Besides the
wheat on board the “ Royal George ” for the Cape of Good
Hope, there are shipped by one mercantile house 129 bales
| (40,000 lbs.) of wool, the giowth of Van Diemen’s Land and
the consignment of two individuals to the mother country.”
Other merchants followed this example and continued to
purchase wool, the settlers meanwhile improving their flocks
the progress made consequent thereon being that, in 1823, the
number of bales shipped in the “ Denervon ” being 550, as
well as a similar quantity in other vessels. The late Mr. James


Cox was one of the earliest breeders of merino sheep, as he
commenced the pursuit in 1820, at which he was most suc-
cessful. Amongst others who may be mentioned as having
engaged in the industry, is the name of Mr. Timothy Narland,
who favoured the New South Wales merino. He stocked
Native Point, the present estate of Messrs. Wm. Gibson and
Son. Mr. Lewis Gillies was also one of the earliest breeders,
who, previous to 1820, whilst on a tour round the world, made
up his mind to settle in Van Diemen’s Land. He saw the
advantages of the climate and its adaptability to sheep farming,
and accordingly wrote to his elder brother in Hamburg who
was connected with Mr. Phillip Oakden, to purchase for him
fifty ewes and ten rams. Unfortunately the vessel in which
they were shipped, whilst on its passage from Hamburg to
Leith, encountered a severe storm, whereby one-half of the
the sheep foundered. The remainder were shipped in the
brig “Allies” from Leith, and reached the colony under Mr.
John Sherwin. A ram and two ewes of this stock were pur-
chased by Mr. James Cox, of Clarendon, and it was from them
that the Clarendon stock was raised. As already stated the
price of wool in the early days of Tasmania was very low, the
late Mr. John Cameron, and Thomas Williams, of Launceston,
purchasing it for 4d. per lb. The price, however, gradually
advanced, until, in 1827, it was worth Is. per lb., which may
probably be attributed to the fact of twelve bales having been
shipped and sold that year in the London market at a profit.
About this time Mr. Forlonge imported some very fine merinos
from Germany, which still further enhanced the value of the
stock. Mr. Gatesby, of Picton, now a hale old country squire,
sold his washed wool, which he had been collecting for some
years, at the rate of Is. per lb. in Launceston, in the early part
of 1827. In 1830, the price had further advanced, and in that
year the father of the Hon. Donald Cameron, of Forden, sold
his washed wool to the late Phillip Oakden for Is. 4d. per lb.
This rise in the price of wool stimulated the industry of breed-
ing merino sheep, and from that date the number of flocks
have steadily increased. In 1835, wool had become an impor-
tant source of wealth, since nearly 2,000,000 lbs. were ex-
ported that year against 200,000 lbs. in 1827, while the price
had advanced from 3d. in 1824, subsequently rising from Is.
to 2s. 6d. per lb. The merinos are used for standing flocks,
while the coarse wool sheep are sold for mutton with very
few exceptions, some districts not being suitable, the propor-
tion being one-twentieth. Tasmania is very suitable for
Highland merino wool, and the best clips rank foremost in the
London market, realising in 1887 as high as Is. 2d. for
merino fleece wool in the grease, for 30 bales from one
clip alone. Undoubtedly the largest flocks are those owned
by Thos. O’Connor, of Connorville, who ships from 800 to 850
bales of wool; next in order comes Chas. Headlam, from 750
to 800 bales; Mr. Alfred Parker, with about 450 bales; D.
Cameron, of Fordon, with, say 300 to 350 ; and a long list of
wool growers who ship from 50 to 250 bales. Merino sheep
breeding is a special feature in Tasmania, the exports in
highly apprised rams and ewes being extensive, and a large
amount of money is embarked in this venture. There are
about 50 breeders in the colony, but the following are the
pioneers who fathered the others Messrs. T. and G. Parra-
more, David Taylor, Esq., H. Johnston, Messrs. Wm. Gibson
and Son, Scone; James Gibson, Esq., Belle Vue; W. H.
Gibson, Fairfield; Joseph Archer, Esq., of Parcharger; H.
Gatenby, Esq., of Rhodes; and W. A. Kermode, Esq., of
Mona Vale. The best markets are Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, and Christchurch, New Zealand, where
large shipments are made annually, and the gross returns from
these various sales have ranged as high as £75,000. In 1887
about 4000 stud rams and ewes were shipped to the above
ports, where high prices have been obtained for individual
rams. In 1885, H. Gatenby, Esq., of Rhodes, exported to
Melbourne a ram called Hercules, which was sold at
public auction for 1150 guineas. This ram had been selected
by Mr. Gatenby as a young sheep from the flock of
David Taylor, Esq., St. Johnstone. Several rams
sired by Hercules and bred by Mr. Gatenby were sold
at the same sales for from 100 to 250 guineas. James
Gibson comes next with his ram, Sir Thomas, which was
sold in Melbourne, in 1881, for 680 guineas, and Sir Thomas
2nd, sold in Sydney the same year, for 604 guineas. The
following year Golden Tom was sold in New Zealand for 500
guineas. Thomas Gibson sold a ram named Commotion in
Sydney, in 1885, for 600 guineas. Although Messrs. Wm.
Gibson and Son, of Scone, have not received the highest
market price for individual rams, yet they have exported a
far larger number of high priced sheep than any other
breeders. At the Melbourne sales in 1887 four stud rams
averaged 442 guineas each, and 16 others 185 guineas each,
these prices being realised notwithstanding that the market
was very dull. The highest price obtained by Messrs.
Gibson for any individual ram was for Garfield, a splendid
sheep, with beautiful silken wool, which was sold for £620.
Next on the list comes Royal Duke, which was sold for 520
guineas. The average price for the lowest quality of sheep
exported ranges from £4 to £l4; these are a good class of
flock sheep. The Tasmanian stud sheep are in much favour
in the Australasian colonies, as they are used for improving
the flocks, the demand is increasing with each succeeding
year, and prices are varying with the pastoral prospects on the
Australian continent. The sheep breeding is nearly all
carried on in the Northern and Midland district of the island,
there being only a few breeders at the Southern end of the
colony, which is not suitable for stud breeding purposes. In
December, 1885, Mr. A. T. Harvey, of Launceston, organised
what is known as the Tasmanian Wool Growers’ Agency
Co., Limited, which is now under his management. This
company answers all the purposes of a sheep breeders’
association, and combines with it a large proportion of the
wool trade and auctioneering business of Northern Tasmania.
Aside from the fact that it is a financial success, the
Association has been a great benefit to the sheep breeding and
farming interests of the colony.
ACCLIMATISATION OF SALMON IN
TASMANIA.
Since the year 1841, efforts were made by the colonists of
Tasmania to acclimatise the English salmon in Tasmanian
waters. In the year 1848, Mr. James L. Burnett, of the Tas-




L. iVoodhouse lilh
Sip Francis F Brady


manian Survey Department, visited the Duke of Sutherland’s
salmon fisheries in Inverness shire and consulted the mana-
ger, Mr. Young, on the practicability of introducing salmon
and trout into Tasmania. Mr. Young suggested two methods,
one to bring out the spawn, and the other to bring out young
fish, giving the preference to the latter. He considered the
undertaking perfectly practicable if it could be accomplished
during the time between extracting the eggs and their hatch-
ing, and was of the opinion that unless that could be done,
the delicate state of the new hatched fish could not endure
the fatigues of a long voyage. Itis recorded inVol. 1, p. 281,
of the “ Proceedings of the Eoyal Society of Tasmania,” the
late Captain Frederick Chalmers, of Brighton, in Tasmania,
applied to Dr. Mackenzie, of Kinillan-by-Dingwall, Boss-
shire, Scotland, for salmon fry to bring to Tasmania. The
fiy were not supplied, but the conespondence is interesting,
and show's how little was then known of the subject, when Dr.
Mackenzie suggested that artificially impregnated ova de-
posited in a basket of fine gravel and plunged in a tank
would require no more attention until it was landed in Tas-
mania, where it could be put into a pail and carried to any
stream and there deposited. Dr. Mackenzie’s last letter to
Captain Chalmers, of 12th July, 1841, says:—“ Next year
you can have some fry sent south to you in better time if you
like, or if you will give me the address of some careful confi-
dential friend, I will send him south two baskets containing
impregnated roe, say in September.” In the year 1852,
through the efforts of those interested in the subject, and at
the instance of the Governor, Sir William Denison, an at-
tempt was made to introduce both salmon and trout by
means of ova. The ova of salmon and trout, num-
bering some 50,000, were shipped on 31st January,
1852. They were placed in a large oval tub or vessel
with a false bottom, 4 feet 6 inches by 3 feet 4 inches,
Ift. Sin. deep, double-sided, made of wood, cased in lead,
and capable of containing 60 gallons of water, beside
the requisite quantity of gravel. Mr. Gottlieb Broccius,
who was employed by the Home Government through the
Land Emigration Commissioners, to procure the ova, fixed
the 15th and 20th April as the dates upon which the trout and
salmon respectively would hatch, but the hatching com-
menced on Ist March, in latitude 14° 30' north, longitude
26° west, and the fry were seen in the tub until the water
became thick and putrid. On arrival of the vessel at Hobart
Dr. Milligan and Mr. J. L. Burnett examined, but failed to
discover any traces of either spawn or fish. In 1853 the Duke
of Newcastle issued instructions for a renewal of the ex-
periment, under the supervision of Mr. Boccius, who provided
the necessary appliances, which were placed on board the
“ Duke of Boxburgh,” but owing to a severe frost having set
in when the ova were required, artificial spawning could not
be successfully completed, and the attempt was therefore
abandoned. On 6th February, 1858, the then Colonial
Secretary of Tasmania submitted certain questions to the
Eoyal Society “relative to the introduction of salmon into
Tasmania,” and the payment of a Parliamentary reward of
£SOO for such introduction, and a committee, consisting of
the Hon. E. S. P. Bedford, M.L.C.; J. W. Agnew, Esq., M.D.;
Morton Allport, Esq.; and Joseph Milligan, Esq., F.L.S., was
s appointed. The idea of the introduction of living salmon was
- still prominent, as the committee state in their report “ that
i the mere introduction of spawn, even though properly
, fecundated and in a state of vitality, ought not of itself to
y entitle the person introducing it to any portion of the reward.”
3 They, however, some years afterwards learned that the most
1 successful means of conveying salmon to distant parts is by
. means of spawn, and that the introduction of living fish as
, then advocated at the time proved a failure. The committee
3 also advocated the use of ice to regulate temperature during
, the v °yage, a method which Mr. Burnett had previously
. suggested. They recommended the construction of breeding
, Ponds, which recommendation was afterwards carried out.
. Sir Thomas Brady, has, however, recently demonstrated the
i feasibility of carrying live salmon to the colonies by success-
, f carrying some fish twelve months’ old to the south of the
. Line, where their deaths were due to improper food. The next
experiment was made in 1860, but, although carried out with
: the utmost care and thought it shared the fate of preceding
ones, the last ovum dying on 24th April and the 59th day out.
It was not until the year 1864 that English salmon was success-
, fully introduced into Tasmania. The “ Beautiful Star ” had
been engaged in 1862 to bring out salmon ova, but before the
vessel proceeded to sea the whole shipment perished. On care-
ful examination it was found that in one small box in the ice-
house, which contained ova packed in moss, vitality was
preserved for a longer period than in others not so packed.
From experiments subsequently made in England under the
direction of Mr. J. A. Youle, a Tasmanian colonist, it was
proved that ova might be kept for at least 140 or 150 days in
a state of healthy vitality, and it was resolved to test this fact
during the season of 1863-4. After much difficulty the ship
“Norfolk” owned by Messrs. Money, Wigram and Sons, and
destined for Melbourne, on 20th January had space
measuring upwards of 50 tons allotted by her owners for
the experiment, who refused to accept any remuneration.
The “ Norfolk ” arrived in Hobson’s Bay on 15th April,
eighty four days out. One of the boxes of ova was opened
and they were found to be in a healthy condition. The boxes
were immediately transferred to H. M. C. S. “Victoria”
which was granted for the conveyance of the shipment to
Hobart Town, where they arrived on 4th April. The boxes
were immediately transferred to the breeding ponds prepared
for the reception of the ova. Mr. Eamsbottom, under whose
charge the ova was brought out, estimated that about 30,000
of them were in a promising condition. On 4th May the
first trout made its appearance, and on the following day the
first salmon that had ever been seen in Australia, or south of
the Equator. A second shipment by the “ Lincolnshire ”
arrived at Hobart Town on 4th May, 1866. They were at
once taken up the Derwent in the cases in which they were
packed in England, and these were carried on poles by men
four miles to the ponds.
SIB THOMAS F. BRADY.
This foregoing notice would scarcely be complete without
mention of a gentleman who has been from the earliest date
associated with the introduction of salmon and trout in Tas-
mania—the more so as he has recently visited the colony with


the largest and most successful importation of salmon ova
that has ever before been attempted in any part of the world.
We refer to Sir Thomas Brady, who came out at the invita-
tion of the Tasmanian Government, and successfully landed,
in April, 1888, the enormous number of 500,000 ova from the
River Earne Co., Danegal. The ova was artificially im-
pregnated and hatched until they arrived in the “ eyed ” state,
and it is estimated that not more than 2 per cent, perished on
the outward voyage. Sir Thomas personally superintended
the collection of the ova, and their subsequent transit from
Ireland to the ponds of the Plenty River. The ova
was given by Mr. Moore, the owner of celebrated
Irish salmon fisheries, and the late Premier of
Tasmania, the Hon. J. W. Agnew, liberally defrayed all the |
expense of the undertaking. Sir Thomas is deservedly
popular in Ireland, where he has done much towards the
development of the fisheries. He inaugurated various
schemes, always of a practical nature, which have been highly
instrumental in improving the condition of the Irish fisher-
men, and his energetic and persistent nature never quails
before difficulties that would seem to less ardent spirits
insurmountable. We have a recent illustration of this in the
establishment of a fisheries school at Baltimore, Co., Cork. His
long practical experience, extending over a period of 42 years,
renders him an eminent authority on fishery matters, and his
services are always in requisition on commissions relative to
fish and oyster culture. He is author of a digest of the
fishery laws, and honorary representative of the Shipwreck
Fishermens’ and Mariners’ Society, and several other societies
in Ireland. For his distinguished public services, he received
the honour of Knighthood, and his philanthrophic efforts on
behalf of the poor fishermen of his native country has earned
for him the title of the “ Fishermen’s Friend.” He is a
gentleman of sound, practical common sense, devoid of
sectarianism, and possessed of an even and affable disposition,
which is appreciated by all who come in contact with him.
The writer of this, who has seen him on errands of mercy on
the wild and rock-bound coasts of a far away land, can
vividly remember many scenes where his kindly smile and
homely words of encouragement were received by a distressed
people with a “ cead mille faithe," and it would be well for
the Emerald Isle if there were many more men of Sir
Thomas’s calibre equally solicitous, and equally practical in
their efforts for the good of her people.
FARRELLY AND STEWART.
In 1858 Messrs. B. P. and W. J. Farrelly commenced business
in the clothing line on the corner of Brisbane and St. John-
streets. During the first four years the business was con-
ducted under the title of O’Rielly and Co., but in 1862 it was
changed to Farrelly Bros., and was conducted under that
name until the death of Mr. W. J. Farrelly in 1872, when the
late Mr. John Murphy, Mayor of Launceston, purchased an
interest in the concern. This partnership continued until
April, 1875, when Mr. Murphy sold out, and in the same year
Mr. G. M. Stewart bought into the concern, the name of the
firm then becoming changed into that of Farrelly and Stewart
—its present title. Until 1877 Messrs. Farrelly and Stewart
devoted their attention to both the wholesale and retail de-
partments, but since that date they have confined themselves
to the retail clothing and custom-made tailoring business.
They employ twenty-four hands in the workshop, and the
pay roll averages about £35 per week. Their traveller makes
regular trips throughout the northern portion of the colony,
to take orders for the custom-tailoring department; and to
show the confidence manifested in the firm’s workmanship it
may be pientioned that a number of the customers who
patronised the firm of Messrs. B. P. and W. J. Farrelly, which
was established, as already stated, in 1858, continue to obtain
their goods from the present one. In 1878 Mr. B. P. Farrelly
was elected alderman, and has ever since been prominently
associated with the Council. In December, 1887, he was
elected mayor of the town. As the firm import their stock of
woollen goods direct from the European manufacturers, they
are therefore enabled to compete successfully with clothiers
from the other colonies, a circumstance which redounds
highly to their credit.
J. C. FURGUSON.
In the year 1831 Mr. James Corbett came to Launceston,
and was amongst the first to establish the ironmongery busi-
ness in Northern Tasmania. At that time transportation was
very brisk, and the business in connection with the English
troops stationed there formed an important part of the trade.
In 1836 Mr. Corbett was joined by his son, Mr. Thos. Corbett,
whom he took into partnership ten years prior to his depar-
ture for Scotland, where he remained but one year and then
returned to Tasmania. Here he resided until 1841, when he
sailed for England, and died there a short time after his
arrival. Mr. Thos. Corbett then assumed the sole charge of
the business, which he continued to hold until the early part
of 1875, when it was handed over to Messrs. Furguson and
Barclay, this partnership becoming dissolved in 1879, the sub-
ject of this sketch purchasing the business, which since that
date has been carried on by him.
EDWARD M. FISHER.
Edward M. Fisher, the manager of the Tasmanian Steam
Navigation Company, was born in Hobart in 1833. He was
educated at the Hutchin’s School, and commenced his
mercantile life in Hobart in 1851, and from that time up to
the present he has been engaged in mercantile pursuits.
From 1860 to 1885 he was a shipowner and exporter from the
port of Hobart, and largely interested in the timber trade to
South Australian, Victorian, and New Zealand ports, in
connection with the output of Tasmanian saw-mills. Mr.
Fisher has held the positions of alderman of the city, master-
warden of the Hobart Marine Board, and he was a director
of the Tasmanian Steam Navigation Company prior to his
acceptance of his present appointment as manager. Under
his experienced supervision the line has become highly popu-
lar with the travelling public, and particularly with summer
tourists, who have been attracted in large numbers by the
courtesy and attention which they receive upon the ships of
the T.S.N. Co.




J. H O UVA/^O
W.H. Knight


W. H. KNIGHT.
In the early days of Australasia, skilled artisans were greatly
in demand, not only to superintend the most important work,
but also to instruct those born in the colonies. Great induce-
ments were, of course, steadily held out to the most skilful
men in the manufacturing districts of England. It, therefore,
may be said, without fear of contradiction, that the large
number of factories at the present day in the colonies owe
their existence to those pioneers who were obliged to overcome
obstacles which would at present overwhelm many men. In
1854 a large saw-mill was built fourteen miles from Laun-
ceston, Tasmania; and to insure the erection of the machinery,
which was manufactured in England, Mr. W. H. Knight was
sent out in charge of four skilled workmen. Arriving at
Launceston, Mr. Knight had the machinery conveyed over a
rough hilly country to the mill, which was located on the
Piper River, where he remained for two years and a half,
when he removed to Launceston. Having determined to
settle in Tasmania, he sent home for his wife and family. In
Tasmania he entered into partnership with an engineer, and,
at the end of three years, it was dissolved by mutual consent,
Mr. Knight, in 1859, commencing business on his own
responsibility. For this purpose he rented premises, and
confined himself solely to the manufacture of mill and
agricultural machinery, an occupation which gave employment
to two men and himself. Owing to the construction of the
Launceston and Western Railway, business with Mr. Knight
began to improve, he having received the contract to supply
all the ironwork used for building the bridges, gates, &c., along
the line. In addition to this contract, he had also one to
manufacture the ironwork necessary for between forty and
fifty goods waggons to be used on the road. To execute this
work in an efficient manner, he imported into the colony the
first superior steam hammer used in Tasmania. After the
completion of this contract, Mr. Knight’s business began to
increase very steadily, and in 1875, the large factory, where the
business is now carried on, was commenced, but not completed
until 1876. At the latter date gold and tin, in paying quantities,
were discovered in various parts of the colony. This important
occurrence gave a still further impetus to Mr. Knight’s business’
as he was the recipient of large orders from the new com-
panies which were being constantly organised. Prominent
amongst these was the Tasmania Gold Mining Company,
located at Beaconsfield, as well as other mines in the vicinity.
To fulfil these orders it was necessary to employ additional
hands, and consequently Mr. Knight was obliged to increase
his staff of workmen to sixteen, and as time went on, and with
it an accumulation of orders took place, more workmen had to
be engaged. About this period Mr. Knight’s health began to
fail, and having entrusted the conduct of the business to his
eldest son, he left Launceston for rest and recreation. Find-
ing that his health did not show symptoms of improvement
by the change, he returned to Launceston, but was unable to
take any active part in the superintendence of the business.
He became gradually weaker, and at length in April, 1878, he
breathed his last, leaving behind him as a monument of his
energy, industry, and perseverance, the most extensive iron
manufacturing business in the colony of Tasmania, and more-
over it is at the present time one of the most prominent and
important industries in Australasia. The entire business now
devolved on Messrs. W. and H. Knight, but the change did
not affect the firm, which was so well and favourably known.
Indeed the orders continued to increase so rapidly that it was
soon found necessary to obtain additional plant. As new
mines were being sunk almost weekly, a large number of
boilers would be required in connection with the mining
machinery, and a ccordingly the firms decided to add this im-
portant branch of the industry to the works which were
already so extensive. To carry out this idea it was necessary to
purchase new machines, and since the orders thus exceeded
all expectations, additional hands were employed. In 1882,
when it was found that the business had grown so much,
and that orders were being received for a class of work
which it was impossible to manufacture without additional
appliances, Mr. Knight had an iron and brass foundry added
to the premises by erecting a building 40 x 70 feet, besides
engaging more workmen. Having in 1885 received from the
Government contractor a large order for iron bridges for the
railways of the colony, Mr. Knight was once more forced to
add new machinery, the most important portion consisting
of the first complete hydraulic portable riveting plant suc-
cessfully worked in the Australasian colonies. In 1886 Mr.
Knight was the successful competitor for two hundred coal
hoppers from the ,Government Railway Department, and a
further addition to the already large works, which now cover
two-and-a-half acres of ground, was rendered compulsory.
Employment is given in this concern to over sixty men. Mr.
Knight sends his manufactured goods to all parts of Tas-
mania, and it is only owing to excessive duties that he is pre-
cluded from exporting to the other colonies. Mr. Knight is
a business man endowed with skill and intelligence; the
large bounds the business has taken are sufficient proof of
superior workmanship; and as an extensive employer, he must
be regarded in the light of a public benefactor to the colony
of Tasmania.
GOLD IN TASMANIA.
The first payable gold in Van Dieman’s Land was discovered
four miles from Fingal, in February, 1852, This dis-
covery attracted 200 persons for a short time, a few making
it pay. Gold in small quantities was also found along Tower
Hill Creek, but in a few weeks, however, these discoveries
were left in the hands of the original claimants, who made a
fair profit out of their industry for a number of years. The
first quartz crushing company, called the Fingal Company,
commenced operations in April, 1859, but the machinery being
imperfect, only 2600z5. of gold were obtained during the
first few months. Mr. James Smith, afterwards the discoverer
of the celebrated Mount Bischoff Tin Mine, found gold on the
River Forth. Various discoveries were made at George’s
Bay, Cleveland, and in the basin of the South Esk, near
Launceston, but the only discovery of any importance was at
the Nine Mile Springs, now Lefroy. In 1864, Mr, Edmund
Hammond Hargraves, the discoverer of gold in Australia, came
to Tasmania on invitation, and visited many parts of the
colony, but he was unable to make any valuable discoveries.


During the early part of 1869, the quartz reefs in the Fingal
district came into prominent notice, a 7-oz. nugget having been
found at Major’s Gully, and one party washed 16ozs. of gold
in a week. In June of the same year Mr. T. G. Williams dis-
covered a reef at Waterhouse, on the N.E. coast, and took
over to Melbourne one ton of stone for treatment, which
yielded 29ozs. of gold. In 1870 gold was discovered at the
Cabbage Tree Hill (now Beaconsfield.) In 1881 there were
155 registered gold mining companies, nearly all of which were
in active operation. In 1883 discoveries of quartz gold came
into notice, and the Mount Victoria and Mercury Gold Min-
ing Companies were organised. Notwithstanding that this
subject has been alluded to in the historical portion of the
work, it was deemed advisable to devote a short space to it in
this place.
HON. WILLIAM HART, M.L.C.
The career of the Hon. William Hart is of a character well
calculated to encourage the young colonists of Tasmania. A
name, which is now familiar in all parts of the island, has
been won by this gentleman by active participation, not only
in commercial pursuits, but in earnest endeavours to promote
the intellectual, social, and moral well-being of his fellow-
colonists. Mr. Hart is a native of London, from whence he
proceeded to Launceston, in 1833, with his parents. In 1846
he established himself in business in Charles-street, near
Brisbane-street, Launceston, and removed to his present
place of business in 1865. He was elected an alderman on
the incorporation of the town in 1858, and was chosen Mayor
for two consecutive terms, namely, 1863 and 1864; being
again elected in 1868. In 1876 he was elected a member of
the Legislative Assembly for Central Launceston, and he
remained a member for ten years. On the resignation of the
Hon. James Aikenhead in 1886, as a member of the Legisla-
tive Council, Mr. Hart was chosen to fill the vacancy, and
was re-elected, in 1888, for the full term of six years. He
has taken an active part in connection with the railway bills
and all matters pertaining to public works, with the view of
assisting the development of the country. Jointly with the
late Hon. W. D. Grubb, he was the purchaser of the cele-
brated Tasmanian Gold Mine, and was the promoter of the
company. From the inception of the enterprise he has been
chairman of the board of directors. Mr. Hart was also one
of the original directors of the Mount Bischoff Tin Mining
Company, and was elected chairman on the resignation of
Mr. William Eitchie. He is interested in the Native Youth
G.M. Company at Lefroy, and in many other mining ventures
in various parts of the colony. The key-note of his success
has been honesty of purpose and indomitable perseverance.
Yet, amidst all the demands upon his time, he has seen
clearly that the duties of a representative citizen are not
merely the acquisition of wealth and public position. During
a residence of 55 years in Launceston he has laboured
assiduously, and has done much to alleviate misfortune and to
assist those who have been less fortunate in the battle of
life. He fully comprehends that great wealth brings with it
corresponding duties to the State and to his fellow-citizens.
His connection with the Sunday schools of the Wesleyan
Church dates back to his infancy. From a scholar he became
a monitor, then a teacher, and finally a superintendent, an
office which he holds at the present time. He has also acted
as steward for the church for many years, and all societies
and organisations labouring for the benefit and moral
advancement of the people receive hearty co-operation at his
hands. Mr. Hart is yet in the prime of life, full of vigour,
and the universal wish is that he may long be spared to assist
and give wise counsel in the land of his adoption. As a Terri-
torial Magistrate, Warden of the Launceston Marine Board,
and Chairman of the Launceston Chamber of Commerce, he
has done excellent service, which, combined with his efforts
in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, demon-
strate conclusively his fitness as a public man for the posi-
tions which he has won by his unaided perseverance and
pluck.
DAVID COCKER.
Me. Cocker was born in the West Biding of Yorkshire, in Sep-
tember, 1831. He is the youngest son of five brothers, and
was brought up to the manufacture of fancy woollens, with his
eldest brother, with whom he came to Launceston, arriving
January Ist, 1851. From that place he proceeded to Mel-
bourne in 1832, and subsequently entered into business in that
city, and also in Adelaide. His brother-in-law, Mr. W. B.
Dean, visited Victoria, and Mr Joseph Sibly arriving from
England, a partnership was formed for erecting a saw mill for
£9OO. Messrs Dean, Sibly, and Benjamin Cocker proceeded
to the Mersey, and seleeted a site. The machinery was
shipped by the schooner “ John Bell ” (owned by the Cockers).
In a short time Mr Sibly retired, and Mr David Cocker took
his place. In journeying from Deloraine to Mersey, in the
winter, Mr Cocker, in crossing Kimberly Ford, nearly lost his
life. Together with the horse, he was carried down the
stream ; but was fortunately thrown against the bank, and
climbed out. He then determined to face the bush, following
for a considerable distance the present railway route, which
was without a track of any kind ; but eventually reached Frog-
more. At that time there were no roads or bridges to the
proposed site of the saw mill, and all had to be opened to get
in the machinery. Eventually the mill was started, and cut
some thousands of feet of timber. The first vessel of any
note was the “ Kerermont,” which was loaded by Mr. Cocker
with great difficulty, all the cargo being floated off. The
“ Wave,” brig, next commenced to make regular trips to the
port for timber. Mr. Cocker was one of the first to select 500
acres of land in the district. In a short time quite a fleet of
timber traders began to make regular visits to the port. As
the vessels had to call at Circular Head to clear, Mr. Cocker
addressed the Governor upon the subject, and the result was
that the port was declared a port of entry. Very extensive
shipments of timber were made until Victoria levied a duty
upon the same. In 1853 Mr. Cocker married Miss C. Dean.
Mr. Cocker was “bailed up” atFrogmore by Dalton and Kelly,
the last of the bushrangers. Mr. Cocker took an active part
in church building, and he entertained the Bev. Mr. McClure,
the first minister, for some months. Services were for some
time held at the mill. In 1854 the mill was sold, and Mr.

Cocker returned to Victoria; but after an interval of two
years again settled at Mersey. In 1862 he left again, and did
not return until 1885, when he commenced farming on 400
acres. He cleared 100 acres at a cost of £lOOO. Mr Cocker
is now engaged in the commission and shipping agency busi-
ness, also superintending his location. He was instrumental
in forming a Town Board, and was elected a member of the
same.
GEORGE ATKINSON.
Mr. Atkinson is a native of England, and came to Tasmania
in 1852, with his parents, removing to the Sorrell district in
the same year. For a number of years he followed agricultural
pursuits, subsequently commencing storekeeping in a small
way at Balahoo. He next erected a hotel at Latrobe, it being
the first hotel built in that town, and known as the Royal
Charter. The license was granted in May, 1858 ; Mr.
Atkinson conducted both the store and the hotel at the same
time. The hotel was afterwards burnt down, but was re-built.
Latrobe is now the third town in the colony in population and
importance. It possesses many fine business premises, and is
the centre for a large agricultural district. For a number of
years Latrobe was retarded owing to the absence of railway
communication. The improvement of shipping facilities and
the construction of the railway gave the place, which possesses
great natural advantages, the impetus which was required,
and to-day it is advancing with rapid strides, the expenditure
of a few thousand pounds on the Latrobe Inlet would prove
highly beneficial, and would lead to increased prosperity. In
1858, an agitation was started for the construction of a tram-
way, viz.: the Mersey and Deloraine Wooden Railway. The
question was agitated until 1863. A subscription was opened
to raise funds for a survey of the line. Finally, Mr. James M.
Dooley made the survey, and an attempt was made to float
the Company, under the title of the Mersey and Deloraine
Tramway Company, with a capital of £50,000, but the scheme
was not successful. A tramway was, however, eventually built
between Railton and Latrobe. Mr. Atkinson has proved a
valuable citizen to the district, and contributed in a material
manner towards the advancement of the town. He is one of
the oldest and most honoured citizens of the place, and is at
present engaged in the storekeeping, auctioneering, and com-
mission business.
F. BOND.
Mr. Bond, the youngest son of Mr. William Bond, is a native
of Tasmania, and received his early education at Launceston.
At the age of fifteen he began business as a bark merchant
at Launceston. In 1882 he built a mill at Hamilton, on the
Clyde, and worked it until 1884, shipping 6,000 tons of bark
during the two years. He then removed to his present pre-
mises, Gladstone Street, Hobart, and now averages an output
of 3,000 tons of bark per annum, which, after being manufac-
tured ready for the market, is exported. He employs ten men
at the mill. He is also agent for Johnson Brothers, ship-
owners. He married, in 1882, the third daughter of Mr. W.
Cowburn, of New Norfolk, and has a family of two children.
FRED KIMBERLY.
Mit. Kimberly is a native of Tasmania, his father, Mr. Wm
Kimberly, was chief constable at Norfolk Island. He after-
wards settled at New Norfolk, Norfolk Plains. The first four-
in-hand seen in Hobart was in 1831, being the property of
Mr. Kimberly, who was then known as the King of Bagdad, in
consequence of the extensive properties which he possessed in
that district. He subsequently removed to Moral Marsh in
the western district. The spot at which he crossed the River
Mersey with his sheep and cattle is still called Kimberly’s
Ford ; date, 1819. In 1850 he took 4000 sheep to the Kentish
Plains. Mr. Fred. Kimberly followed farming for eight or
nine years in the vicinity of Latrobe, then removed to the
River Don and leased the Don Hotel, also purchasing land,
which he farmed. In 1887 he sold the Don property, pur-
chasing an allotment in Formby township, upon which he
built an hotel, which is commodious and pleasantly situated
immediately opposite the docks, commanding a fine view of
the Mersey River. Travellers and tourists will find the house
supplied with every convenience and well worthy of liberal
patronage.
W. B, DEAN.
One whose name is closely identified with the history
of Tasmania is that of Mr. Dean, who arrived in that part
of the British Empire in 1837. The passengers having
been allowed to remain for fourteen days at Port Nicholson,
Mr. Dean at once commenced operations by engaging the
Maories to build him a house out of the native flax. Being
a baker by trade he purchased from Mr. Rhodes, a fellow-
passenger, four hundred bricks, with which to build an oven.
After some time in the bakery business he sold out to Mr.
Goodfellow, and took his passage in an American vessel
named the “ Black Warrior,” which sailed for Sydney, and
whilst there Mr. Dean took a contract from Messrs. Barker
and Sons to manufacture several tons of biscuits. Whilst
working for this firm he was waited on by Sir Alfred Stephen,
at that time Attorney-General of New South Wales, who had
received a letter from H. Jennings, Esq., of Launceston, with
a request to find out where Mr. Dean was. Leaving Sydney,
he arrived in Launceston in 1839, and was most kindly
received by Mr. Jennings. Disliking the colonies he
determined on returning to England, but before reaching
Hobart Town he relented, as he conceived it selfish to leave
his sister, who, it may be mentioned, preceded him to Tas-
mania by several years, and consequently he returned to
Launceston, and commenced business in John-street, which
prospered exceedingly. When the Exhibition was held in
London his exhibit was highly commended by the Lords of
the Admiralty, and he received a handsome medal. At an
early date he joined Isaac Sherwin, Messrs. Tyson, Tevelin,
Stubbs, and Angel, in bringing out the Teetotal Advocate,
which lived for two years, at a loss of £SOO. Mr. Tyson and
several otlier abstainers frequently arose at 4 a.m., and worked
in erecting a building in which temperance meetings were
subsequently held. A publican hired a prize-fighter to inter-
fere with the temperance procession, Mr. Dean knocked the
fellow down, and threw him over the publican’s fence. Owing


to disturbances made in conducting temperance meetings Mr.
Dean purchased the land where the present building now j
stands and contributed largely. He was one of the 12 who I
organized the Rechabite Order. The following summary of
his good deeds speak for themselves Prizes of from 10 to 15
guineas for Juvenile Essays ; £SO for the first Juvenile Exhi- j
bition; £ls 15s. for essays on Sabbath Observance; a Life 1
Subscriber to St. John’s Hospital; £3 3s. tor the best kept
garden by a working man ; subscriber to the first Agricultural
Society; a public banquet to Dr. Nixon, the first Bishop;
demonstration to Mr. Dry, including active parts in preparing
two banners inscribed “ Welcome to our native born Prince,”
i
and showing liberty bursting the chains from slavery, this |
being the first public demonstration held in Tasmania in
favour of popular rights; Mr. Dean and Mr. Tevelin organized j
a meeting to protest against transportation, Mr. Crooke in the |
chair. Speeches were made by Messrs. John Denny and John
Richards. Mr. Dean organized the agitation which led to the i
establishment of Government Savings Banks, he contributed
largely to the local press in favour of the rights of the people,
gave generously to all subscriptions and assisted many
struggling families. In enterprise he has seldom been sur-
passed. In 1845-6 he joined with Mr. Henty, Mr. Reed, and
Mr. Oakden, in making extensive shipments of wheat and
flour to England, holding a large interest in the “ Lady Mary,”
which was lost at sea. He was one of the promoters of a
Ship Building Association at Gravelly Beach. He joined
with Mr. Tyson in sending men to the Pieman River to cut
pine. Joined Mr. R. G. Gibbons in a splitting speculation at j
theLeven ; and Mr. Johnston in the same business at the Mer-
sey. He was one of the first to ship produce to California on ■
the discovery of gold in that State. He made a shipment of
South down sheep co the Sandwich Islands. He sent Mr. j
Cocker to Circular Head, to purchase potatoes from the far-
mers, in 1851. While passing the night at a hut in the bush,
having been lost in the woods, he received the information
which led to the formation of the Mersey Coal Company on
Fryingpan Creek. Receiving the news 24 hours before any
other person in Tasmania of the discovery of gold in New
South Wales, he made extensive purchases, and cleared
£SOOO on the transactions. In company with Chas. Weedon
and John Griffiths, he fitted out the “Launceston” for a sperm
whaling voyage. In company with the Cockers he established
a saw-mill on the north side of the Island, in the same year
purchasing an allotment at the corner of Flinders and
Swanston-streets, Melbourne, for £IBSO. He ordered machi-
nery from London, and established the first biscuit factory
in Australasia, viz., in St. John-street, Launceston. He next
formed the Don Coal Company, abandoned the old mine, and
opened up new shafts on his own property. Owing to an
accident he became a cripple for two years ; and owing to un-
fortunate undertakings left the Mersey, and bought back his 1
old business in Launceston. Prospered again; but endorsed
bills to the amount of £SOOO, which being called upon to
pay ruined him. When the property was sold here-purchased,
with assistance from the Bank. After many reverses, includ-
ing bankruptcy, he took the North Esk Mill, but a flood came,
which again nearly ruined him. He next paid a visit to England
for the benefit of his health. On his return he purchased the site I
of the Bischoff Tin Smelting Works. He again, with the assist-
ance of the Bank, purchased the bread portion of the bakery
business, and established the Phcenix Works, and prospered
exceedingly until he suffered a paralytic stroke, from which
he has never recovered. From first to last he has been ener-
getic, untiring, and honest: a worthy citizen, full of the best
characteristics which combine to make a man in the highest
sense of the term.
WILLIAM ANDERSON WEYMOUTH.
Mr. Weymouth is the eldest son of William Weymouth, Esq.,
formerly Bench Clerk of the Police Office, Hobart, and
afterwards Chief Clerk of the Police Office, Launceston. Mr.
Weymouth, the subject of this sketch, was born at Launces-
ton, September 24th, 1841. He received his education at the
schools of Mr Robert Giblin, Hobart; Mr Connor, and the
Rev. Charles Price, Launceston. In 1855 he entered the
office of the Launceston Examiner, for training as a composi-
tor. In 1861 he was promoted to the reporting staff, retain-
ing his position until 1867, when he removed to Hobart.
After spending several years in the stationery and publishing
house of Messrs. J. Walsh and Sons, he, in 1873, became the
local agent for the Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Tas-
mania, and in 1874 of the National Mutual Life Association
of Australasia, of both of which offices he has for some years
been the Resident Secretary. On the 25th of March, 1869, he
married Phoebe, fifth daughter of the late Robert Thompson,
Esq., of Launceston, by whom he has had eleven children.
Mr Weymouth is a Deacon of the Davey-street Congregational
Church, and President of the Band of Hope ; Treasurer of the
Southern Auxiliary of British and Foreign Bible Society.
JOHN HENRY.
Mr. Henry is a native of the Shetland Isles. He came to
Victoria in 1854, where he remained for 18 years, engaged in
mercantile pursuits. He conducted a store at Castlemaine,
from which he removed to Melbourne, carrying on business in
Flinder’s Lane as a wholesale grocer. In 1872, he removed
to Tasmania, and, in company with Mr. Andrew Lyell and
Mr. George Horne (partners in the well-known firm of Lyell
and Gowan), purchased the estate of Cummings and Co., of
the Don, afterwards conducting business as Cummings, Henry
and Co., subsequently formed into a Limited Liability Co. In
1887, the Company transferred its headquarters from the Don
to Formby, owing to its superior facilities for shipping. At
one time the Company was interested in the saw-mill busi-
ness, but at present is devoted exclusively to the import and
export trade of the colony. Their business places are:
Head quarters at Formby; branches, Sheffield, Barrington,
Don, Dunorland. The turnover of the Company is about
£BO,OOO per annum. The export trade is principally with
Sydney, and the import trade with Melbourne. Potatoes ex-
ported per year, 60,000 tons. The Company have established
at the Don, a bacon curing establishment, curing 1000 hogs
per annum, which promises to develop into an extensive busi-
ness, being at present in its infancy.


ROGER WINSPEAR.
Mr. Winspear is a native of Northumberland, England, and
arrived at Port Philip in 1853, proceeding to the Mersey
River, Tasmania, the same year, in the schooner “ Killemont,”
Captain Roberts, in company with Mr. John Coxen. Both i
took employment with the Mersey Coal Company. At that
time the manager of the Company was Mr. David Cocker, of
Hart’s Creek. After a short stay he returned to Victoria and
visited the Bendigo Gold Field, and for 12 months mined in
various parts of the colony. In 1854 he returned to the Mersey
and commenced business as a butcher at Torquay. At that time
Torquay was in its infancy, the township consisting of one
store and one hotel. The store was owned by Mr. Drace and
the hotel by Mr. Isaac Stephens. Mr. Winspear greatly en-
larged his business as the place grew. He also invested
largely in real estate. For a number of years he was a mem-
ber of the Road Trust, and took an active part in every move-
ment calculated to advance the district. In the early days
the leading residents were the Rev. John Bishtow, Mr. Old-
acre, Mr. Bartholamew, Mr. Wm. Thomas, Mr. Robert Stewart,
and Mr. Moore. Mr. Winspear has now retired from active
business, and is an honoured citizen deeply respected.
CAPTAIN JOHN MURRAY.
Captain Murray is a native of Scotland. He arrived in
Melbourne in 1853, from thence proceeding to Tasmania as
mate of the “ John Murray.” He followed seafaring life
principally in the Tasmanian trade. In 1865 he settled at
Formby, on the N.W. Coast. In the early days the trade
consisted in exporting timber, principally to Melbourne, the
Cocker Bros, being the first to commence saw-milling and
shipping on the Mersey. At that date, 1854, Torquay con-
sisted of a police camp, one hotel owned by Mr. Stephens, and
a few tents. The Mersey was not a port of entry, the nearest
being Port Sorrell, 14 miles distant. In 1857, Torquay was
proclaimed a port of entry. The first steamer to the Mersey
entered in 1854, or 1855, arriving from Melbourne with a cargo
of sheep. Then followed the “ Titania,” of Launceston, and the
“ Persey,” owned by Captain Murray. Some 15 years since the
ships of the Launceston S.N. Co. began to make regular
trips to the port. On the completion of the railway to
Formby, some three years since, that town rapidly improved,
and to-day is the principal point on the N.W, Coast.
Formby boasts of the following premises:—River Don
Trading Co., Edginton and Co., Launceston and Sydney;
T.S.N. Co.’s offices. The exports are principally farm
produce. Exports 1887, potatoes alone 27,000 tons. Average
tonnage per month, 8000 tons. The wharfage ranks
third in Tasmania. The bar at the entrance of the
river is being dredged, so as to give 16ft. at low
tide. Captain Murray has for the past four years been
Harbour Master of Formby, Torquay and Latrobe,
and discharges his duties with zeal and fidelity. Contracts
have been let for building a lighthouse at the Heads, and two
leading lights on the river, which will greatly benefit the ship-
ping. Formby is the headquarters of the Marine Board,
which consists of nine warders, namely, Latrobe 3, Formby
1, Torquay 1, Don 1, Forth 1, Ulverstone 2; Mr. C. J. Hall,
chairman; Captain Murray, Harbour Master; Thos. Towns-
hend, engineer; F. A. Padfield, Secretary; income of the
Board, £1,300 per annum. The railway is now being extended
to Ulverstone, and this will greatly increase the trade of the
port. Memo, of Customs, Formby, 1887: —Imports,
£69,550; exports, £73,150; duties, £7,000; Marine Board
changes, £1,371; sundry, £6.
ROBERT WALKER.
Mr. Robert Walker is a native of Hobart, being the third
son of Mr, George Washington Walker, of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
His early education was obtained at Horton College and the
High School, Hobart. At the early age of 15 he entered upon
business pursuits. The business in Liverpool-street,
Hobart, was conducted for five years by Messrs. White and
Walker as general drapers and grocers, when the partnership
was dissolved, and Mr. Walker took over the grocery portion.
The trade is one of the oldest in the colony, having been es-
tablished in 1826 by John Watchorn, having been conducted
under the following names, viz., Watchorn ; Watchorn and
Perkins; Perkins and Co.; Perkins and Nephew ; White and
Walker. At present Mr. White conducts the drapery portion.
Mr. Walker married 1869 the eldest daughter of Mr. James
Amos, of Cranbrook, Swansea, Tasmania, by whom he has
had seven children. The establishment gives employment
to 10 hands, and the trade is very extensive, the house enjoy-
ing an excellent reputation for fair dealing. The stock is
large and varied, especial efforts being constantly put forth to
secure only the best class of goods.
THE REV. P. E. RAYNOR, M.A.,
Warden of Christ’s College, Hobart.
The Rkvd. Phillip Edwin Raynor, M.A., of New College,
Oxford, now warden of Christ’s College (lately the High
School), Hobart, was born in Kelvedon Hatch Rectory, near
Ongar, Essex, on February 17, 1857, and until the age of 9
was educated by his father, the Rev. George Raynor, who,
from 1851 to 1853, was curate of Morpeth, N.S.W. At the
age of 9 he was placed in Tonbridge School, where he was
under the Rev. E. I. Welldon, the father of the present head-
master of Harrow. In the following year he obtained a
scholarship in Winchester College, where he stayed eight
years; and at the end of his course he took the first place on
the roll of scholars to New College.
Entering New College, Oxford, in 1875, he took a Double First
Class in classical honours, and won the Gaisford University
prize for a Greek essay. Being debarred from cricket and
rowing in consequence of an injury received when footballing
at Winchester, he found a congenial sport in bicycling, in
which he represented Oxford against Cambridge in the five
miles’ race. Of road riding he was very fond ; and he has
covered many thousand miles of road in England and France,
often doing 100 miles a day, and on one occasion 120. On leaving
Oxford he took the sixth form mastership in Highgate School,
I where he remained at work for four years, taking an active


part in most school sports and institutions. In 1882 he was
ordained deacon, and in 1883 priest, by the then Bishop of
London, Dr. Jackson. He took a high place at both Ordination
examinations, and was also placed in the Frst Class in the
Cambridge Preliminary Theological Examination. He served
as curate in St. Anne’s Church, Highgate, under the Rev. C.
T. Aekland, for two years. In 1883 he was appointed as
Junior Sixth Form Master in Marlborough College, where he
remained for two years. In 1885 he acted temporarily as
head master of Warwick Grammar School, and then accepted
a mastership in Wellington College, which he held uutil ap-
pointed to his present position. At Wellington Mr. Raynor
was a member of the School Volunteer Corps.
In 1885 he married Miss Cursham, of Wilford, Nottingham.
Since Mr. Raynor has been in Hobart he has thoroughly re-
organised the school. Among the institutions revived or
freshly started under Mr. Raynor’s regime may be mentioned
a Natural History Society and Museum, a boys’ reading room
and library, a gymnasium class, and a school magazine
(Christ’s College Magazine) ; while cricket, football, and
athletic sports have received a fresh impetus. Mr. Raynor
himself plays nearly all games (cricket, football, fives, rac-
quets, &c.), and always takes part with the boys in their school
games. As a mark of their appreciation, the boys and mas-
ters of Christ’s College presented Mr. Raynor with a portrait
of himself at the end of his first year at the college. He
takes considerable interest in entomology, philately, and
printing.
W. E. STOPFORD.
Me. Stopfoed is a native of England, having been born in
1848. In 1886 he arrived in Tasmania, and in the Jubilee year
signalised that important epoch by establishing his school for
the elementary education of junior pupils. Mr. Stopford is a
member of the Masonic order, of the cricket club, and several
other societies. He is a firm believer in physical culture, and
consequently has established extensive play-grounds for the
pupils under his charge. Experience has taught him the
advisability of combining, in an entertaining manner, the dry
details of fact with the charm of narrative, hence he is highly
successful as a teacher. The school is admirably situated,
and commands an excellent view of the river.
ALEXANDER GARDINER.
Me. Gaediner is a native of Scotland, who came to Tasmania
in 1857, having been engaged in England to work for the
Mersey Coal Co. About the year 1859, he proceeded to
Victoria, where he married and worked on a sheep station for
three years. He then returned to Tasmania. He purchased
a horse and cart, drove from Melbourne to Geelong, where he
took passage on the steamer “ Black Swan,” to Launceston,
from whence he drove to the River Forth, in which district he
settled, leasing a farm of 100 acres, subsequently leasing an
additional 70 acres from Mr. James M. Dooley. After farming
|or 16 years, Mr. Gardiner proceeded to Victoria in 1872, taking
up a selection in the Lilydale district, but forfeited the same,
and returned to Tasmania, where he purchased a farm of 309
acres on the Forth. He has since enlarged his holding to 350
acres. He carries on farming, and has recently leased the
Club Hotel at Latrobe. This hotel is one of the oldest in the
town, is centrally located, and is, in every particular, well
fitted up for the comfort of guests. Mr. Gardiner was, for 9
years, a trustee of the Road Board of the district.
THE REV. J. V. BUCKLAND.
The Rev. J. V. Buckland is the eldest son of the late Rev.
J. R. Buckland, who was for 28 years head-master of the
Hutchin’s School, over which his son now presides. The
latter gentleman received his early education at the Hutchin’s
School, and subsequently want to the Melbourne University,
where he was one of the earliest students at Trinity College-
After holding an appointment for a short time at the Church
of England Grammar School in Geelong, he became tutor to
the sons of Sir Charles Du Cane, Governor of Tasmania. On
the death of his father he was appointed acting head-master
of the Hutchin’s School at the request of the parents of several
of the pupils, and the appointment was confirmed upon his
ordination in 1876. Under his management the school has
fully maintained its well-established reputation. An account
of its early history will be found in this work in the chapter
devoted to education.

Hon .W, G. Grubb


HON. WILLIAM DAWSON GRUBB.
Me. Grubb was borninLondon, 16thOctober, 1817, and arrived
in Launceston, Tasmania, in 1831. He was engaged in the
mercantile establishment of the late Mr. Henry Eeed, for about
one year. He then returned to England, and completed his
education, and afterwards studied law. In 1841 he married
Marianne, eldest daughter of the late Joseph Beaumont, Esq.,
of Huddersfield, Yorkshire, and returned to Tasmania in
1842. After being admitted as a solicitor, &c., he commenced
practice in Launceston, and shortly afterwards became a
partner of Henry Jennings, Esq. On the retirement of Mr.
Jennings in 1849, Mr. Grubb successfully conducted the
business alone until 1867, when he was joined by his eldest
son, Mr. Fred W. Grubb, and continued in partnership with
him until 1874, when he retired from the business. After his
retirement he engaged very actively in mining and other
matters, and took a lively interest in everything calculated to
develop the resources of the colony. Shortly after settling in
Launceston he removed to Brownfield, West Tamar,
where he resided until about the year 1855, when he pur-
chased the picturesque estate of Newnham Hall, on the East
Tamar, from the late John Cameron, Esq., and continued to
reside there up to the time of his desth. In 1869 Mr. Grubb
was elected one of the Members to represent the District of
Tamar, in the Legislative Council, and filled the seat until his
death. He was connected with the Wesleyan Church, and
consistently filled almost every official position in it. He
gave a donation of £lOOO towards the erection of the new
Wesleyan Church, in Patterson-street, and was chosen, the
year previous to his death, as one of the first lay represen-
tatives sent to the Australasian Wesleyan Triennial Con-
ference, held in Melbourne. In his private life, Mr. Grubb
was an energetic and enterprising man, and had great faith
in the resources of this island; embarking at various times
a large amount of capital to develop them. In his public
life he was identified with nesrly every movement calculated
10 advance the well-being of the community, and during the
last few years of his life, while a Member of the Legislative
Council, he was one of the most prominent and useful mem-
bers of that body. With a mind naturally keen, and further
sharpened by legal training, he was quick in detecting
errors and weak points in the arguments of his fellow
members, and he was equally fearless and persistent in ex-
posing them. Whilst he was favourable to a judicious
expenditure of public money when it was really necessary, or
was likely to be reproductive, he was always opposed to the
fancy schemes propounded from time to time, frequently for
mere political purposes, but which if carried out would have
entailed heavy burdens upon the community without any
corresponding advantage. It cannot be doubted that his
vigilance and determination prevented many legislative mis-
takes, and much injury to the colony, and his loss was
severely felt. During the many years Mr. Grubb was an
active member of the community he was connected with
several important attempts to develop the mineral and other
resources of the colony, in fact so great was his faith in the
auriferous resources of Tasmania that he sunk, in unprofit-
able ventures, amounts which would have deterred most men
from further speculation. This was particularly the case in
the Fingal District years ago, when he lost many thousands
of pounds. Later on he invested largely and unprofitably in
the Lefroy goldfields (then called Nine Mile Springs), but on
the revival of Lefroy a few years after, further investments
gave a more cheering result, the returns from the “ New
Native Youth” claim going a good way to recoup previous
losses. More recently still came Daily’s discoveries at
Brandy Creek (now called Beaconsfield), and Mr. Grubb
secured a large interest in what is now the Tasmania Com-
pany’s claim, possessing the richest reef ever found in the
colony, and surpassed by few reefs in Australia. Among
other ventures in which Mr. Grubb sunk large amounts, may
be mentioned the Mersey Coal Company, in which he lost
heavily, and the Piper Eiver Sawmill, on which many
thousands were sunk. In connection with Mr. William Tyson
he established a sawmill at the Upper Pipers’ Eiver, and laid
down ten miles of tramway to the George Town-road at
Mowbray, importing also machinery and skilled labour at
heavy expense. The tramway had not long been opened
when prices fell to less than half and the sawmill was given
up, the speculation having proved a very costly one. Not-
withstanding these rebuffs Mr. Grubb was able to invest
largely in property, and owned a number of valuable
properties in the north of the island ; the estate of Middle
Plains, near Deloraine, being one of the most valuable.
Mr. Grubb left a widow, who still survives him, and a
family, consisting of three sons and two daughters—the sons
being Messrs. Fred. W. Grubb, of Hatherley, Lyttleton;
Chas. B. Grubb, of Strathroy, near Launceston; and W. C.
Grubb, of Tolarno, St. Leonard’s. The eldest daughter
married theEev. G. T. Heyward, and the younger Mr. William
Gibson, junior, of Scone, Perth.
The cause of Mr. Grubb’s death was heart disease.
The Hobart Mercury referring to the sudden death of Mr.
Grubb, says : —“ To say that Mr. Grubb’s death is a public
calamity is but to state a simple truth. To be able, to be
honest, to be firm, yet courteous, and more than all to be
above suspicion of place-hunting or interested motives, is the
lot of few public men, yet that proud position was the un-
questioned position of the Hon. William Dawson Grubb.”
AIKEN, LENNOX, & CO.
Woollen Factory, Macquarie-street, Hobart.
Mr. Murray Aiken is a native of Peebleshire, Scotland. In
1884 he emigrated to Tasmania in connection with the woollen
trade, but on the 15th of May, 1886, he sailed for Scotland to
procure the machinery necessary for establishing a woollen
factory. In January, 1887, he commenced actual work.
The machinery is all of the latest design, no expense having
been spared to facilitate the manufacture of goods equal to
the best imported. Employment is given to 20 hands, and an
extensive trade is done in all parts of the colony. Mr. Aiken
married in 1884 a daughter of Mr. Hope, of Innerleithen,
Scotland, by whom he has had one child.

THE COLONY OE VICTORIA
TO THE TIME OE SELF-GOVERNMENT.
1851-185 5.
Continued from Vol. Page 84.
notice produced an effect contrary to the expectations of Mr. La Trobe
«l| and his Council, for the agitation was renewed with greater violence.
On the 2nd of September, Mr. La Trobe asked for aid from Tasmania.
Lieutenant Clarke, E.E., formerly private secretary to Sir W. Denison, and at the
time Surveyor-General of Victoria, conveyed the despatch. Mr. La Trobe, in
addition, appealed on September 3 to General Sir Robert Nickle for re-inforcements to
be sent immediately. The military head-quarters, which were then in Sydney, were
at once removed to Melbourne. On September 6, by his explanation to Sir Charles
Fitzroy, Mr. La Trobe showed that he could not read the signs of the times, and
it is probable that the chief officers at Sandhurst may have misled him by their
reports. In such a case he cannot be so severely censured, since, not being on the
spot himself, he was obliged to rely for information on those who were supposed to
be keen observers of what was going on and of the effects likely to be produced. Mr.
La Trobe’s explanation may be said to be an abject apology, and was quite a contrast
to the remonstrance addressed to Sir Charles Fitzroy. He did not send the Governor-
General’s answer to England, but it was known that Sir Charles Fitzroy denounced,
in unmeasured terms, the action of the Victorian Government, on the question of
the license-fee (very properly too), since a concession was in the first instance granted
when demanded by threats of a revolutionary nature, and then, when it was thought
that no explosion would occur, withdrawn. Moreover, the Government had taken no
steps to cause the diggers to feel that they were a portion of the colony. They were
not given to understand that they should take any action in furthering the interests
of the colony, socially, politically, or commercially. They were looked upon as so
many gold-hunting carrions. They were not enfranchised ; in short, they had no


social standing. Moreover, the Government could not be induced to sell adequate
quantities of the public lands, such as would have afforded a digger the opportunity
of having his own house and little plot of ground.
To return to the subject of the license-fee. It was little wonder that Mr. La
Trobe was anxious to be relieved from his office, when such perplexing and harassing
questions had to be decided. Sir W. Denison, who is described as a man of most
determined character, and one desirous of doing everything that would benefit the
country at large, was spoken of as his successor. The report of the Select Committee
upon the crisis was submitted to the Legislative Council, which hastened to pass an Act
authorising the Governor to alter the fees. A license for one month was to cost £l,
while one for three, six, or twelve months, was to cost at the rate of £2 for three months,
and credit for payments already made, by those having taken licenses under the old law,
was to be given. The most important matters which came on for discussion in the
first session were those arising out of the increased expenditure, occasioned by the
rapid development of the goldfields. On November 26, 1851, on the motion for going
into committee on the estimates being put, an amendment—“ That it be an
instruction to the committee that the public expenditure, originating in the discovery
of gold, ought to be borne by the territorial revenue, and that no part of such expense
should be taken from the general revenue,” was carried. On the 2nd December His
Excellency sent a message to the effect that the estimates were framed at a time
when it was impossible to foresee what the effect of existing circumstances
would be on the price of labour; and that the subordinate officers should receive
such an advance of pay as would enable the Executive Government to have the public
service free from embarrassment. This message, over which there was a Ion"
tD
discussion, was held to be aimed at the former resolution, a view which the Speaker
entertained, and consequently he declined to put the question. The additional
payments from the territorial revenue were therefore sanctioned by His Excellency
on his own responsibility, a step which he had to ask the Imperial authorities to
confirm. The measure to restrain unauthorised mining on Crown lands having been
passed, the Council was prorogued on January 6, 1852. The second session of the
Legislative Council was opened on June 22, 1852, by His Excellency, and extended
over nearly eight months. Since New South Wales was in debt to the colony of
Victoria, attempts were made to have some settlement of the balance due, and to
have the boundary line between the two colonies distinctly defined, but neither of
these efforts succeeded. During the session the Executive was called upon to sell
land, both town and suburban, for the use of those residing near the cities, and also
agricultural land in the vicinity of the goldfields.
On the 2nd of April, 1852, a gang of men, numbering twenty-two, armed to the
teeth, with their faces blackened or covered with crape, in order to prevent detection
and recognition, proceeded at an early hour in two boats with muffled oars, from the
beach at Sandridge to the barque “Nelson,” lying off the lighthouse at Williamstown.
They boarded her, and succeeded in carrying off the whole of the gold, contained in


23 packages, and weighing 8183 ounces, which was part of her cargo for England.
Notwithstanding so large an amount of treasure deposited in her, no watch was kept,
and the pirates could, with very little difficulty, secure two men and a boy, who were
in the forecastle, before they could raise any alarm. Dispersing themselves over the
vessel, some went aft, and seized the chief officer and a friend, who, together with the
carpenter, w r ere asleep in the cabin, whilst others threw overboard all the small arms
within their reach, as well as the swivel guns mounted on the poop-deck. Mr.
Draper, the chief officer, received a slight wound in the thigh, from a shot fired by
one of the buccaneers, before they succeeded in overpowering him and his companion.
After having lashed their captives’ hands together, they commenced plundering the
storeroom under the cabin floor. Captain Wright, the commander of the vessel, was
ashore, and only seven of the crew remained on board. The robbers, having secured
the treasure of which they were in search, deposited it in the boats, taking the
precaution, before quitting the vessel, of imprisoning all hands in the above-named
storeroom, where they were not allowed to remain long, as one of the seamen, who
had escaped their notice during the early part of the fray, secreted himself, and
emerging from his hiding place on their departure, released the prisoners. The
chief officer, on being liberated, proceeded to Williamstown, and gave information to
the proper authorities of what had transpired. A search was immediately instituted,
but nothing was discovered until daylight, when they found one of the boats half a
mile from the beach towards St. Kilda, together with wheel tracks of a dray brought
there to convey away the booty. Another boat was found on the Williamstown
beach. A body of mounted police, under the command of Captain Sturt, scoured the
country, but no trace of the dray or of the gang of men could be found. Some years
afterwards four men, named John Jones, James Morgan, James Duncan, and John
Roberts, were charged with the robbery, tried, found guilty, and sentenced to penal
servitude for life, but no tidings of the stolen gold has ever been discovered, and it is
probable that the mystery will never be cleared up. One of the convicted persons, it
is said, was not guilty of the crime for which he was sentenced, but his close
resemblance to the party for whom he had been mistaken was the cause of his not
being acquitted.
In the month of September a most important despatch was received from Sir
John Pakington, which stated that the gold revenue and the land fund were to be
regarded as at the disposal of the Legislature. This gave such satisfaction that a
resolution was passed conveying the thanks of the Council to him for the concessions
he had made to the colony. We have already alluded to the transportation question,
which came on for discussion during the session, and also to the Chinese question,
which was for the first time taken notice of during the same session. On February
8, 1853, the Legislative Council was prorogued by His Excellency, who in his speech
congratulated the members upon the success of the new tariff, as being likely to
increase the customs revenue. He advocated the establishment of county courts and
general sessions, and expressed great satisfaction with the Act to facilitate the arrest


of offenders illegally at large, a measure to which we have already alluded at length.
The Harbour Regulation and Pilotage Act received his notice, as well as the measure
for general registration, and he regarded the enactment relating to the organisation
of the police force to be productive of that efficiency which would secure peace, and
maintain order in the cities and populous districts. He alluded to the bill proposing
additional and liberal provision for public worship, with which he heartily concurred,
and to which he readily assented. He also welcomed the bill for altering the
Electoral Act of 1851, by which the number of members of the Legislative Council
was increased.
There was no general postage act at this time, but he would like to have seen
one introduced during the past session; deplored the embarrassments and loss
which masters and owners of vessels experienced by the desertion of seamen, who,
of course, fled to the goldfields; and advocated the necessity of some measure to
put a stop to the system. Forty-five bills were passed during the session.
The Legislative Council, now having been increased by the addition of sixteen
elected members, in accordance with the constitution of the colony, which also gave
His Excellency the power of nominating eight members, was opened in its third
session by His Excellency.
The new Colonial Secretary, J. F. L. Foster, Esq., who arrived from England in
July, 1853, appeared as leader of the official side of the House. He was an old Port
Phillip colonist, and had been returned to represent the colonists in the old New South
Wales Legislature. He after this returned to England, and was subsequently appointed
by the Duke of Newcastle to the office in which Captain Lonsdale had endeavoured
to do his duty, but which, from the first, he would gladly have vacated. Mr.
Foster, who was related to Mr. Stawell, was not a favourite, but was considered fully
qualified to discharge the functions of his office, which were truly multifarious.
Captain Lonsdale became Treasurer, and retained a place in the Executive Council.
His Excellency having alluded to the continued prosperity of the colony, and the
augmentation of the number of members under the Act passed during the last
session, announced that the Imperial Government had decided to give the colonies
increased constitutional privileges, reference to which shall be made later on.
He also touched upon the proposition for abolishing the license fee on gold
diggers, and in its place the imposition merely of a registration fee. He also, in the
course of his address, stated it was probable that he would shortly be succeeded by
another Governor, and that it was with some degree of pride he looked back to what
Port Phillip was, and how much Victoria had gained in importance and prosperity from
the time that he had the privilege of being entrusted to administer the colony's
affairs. On the 12th of April, 1854, the House was prorogued by His Excellency,
who announced that his successor had been nominated, in the person of Sir Charles
Hotham, by the Luke of Newcastle. Although Mr. La Trobe had been severely
censured for his conduct, especially in the Bendigo affair, still we can only say that
it is easy to be wise ex post facto. The difficulties with which he had to contend are


unknown to Governors of the present clay, and notwithstanding his want of brilliancy,
his severest critics must admit he acted conscientiously, and according to his light.
His Excellency Mr. La Trobe left the shores of Australia on the sth of May, in the
“ Golden Age.” The unexpected death of Mrs. La Trobe on the 30th of January
previous, was announced to him shortly before his departure. She was in good
health when starting with her family in the “Blackwall” for England, where she
expected to meet His Excellency in a few months.
This expectation could not be realised owing to Mr. La Trobe being unable to
vacate his appointment as soon as he had hoped—the delay being caused through the
difficulty of selecting a suitable governor to succeed him. On the morning of his
departure he held a levee, and was afterwards conveyed on board the “ Golden Age”
by the barge of H.M. ship “ Electra.” A melancholy accident happened as His
Excellency was embarking. Mr. Samuel Barrow, chief immigration agent, was
drowned, through the boat, in which he was seated, being upset.
While Mr. La Trobe held office, the Imperial authorities refrained from passing
any censure on his conduct, but when he reached home, the Secretary of State
imparted to him his dissatisfaction with the latter part of his career in Victoria. One
charge which seems paltry was that he had resided in the house of a gentleman while
receiving the pay of the State ; and another, which is absurd, was that he accepted
plate from his friends previous to leaving the colony. Mr. La Trobe had property in
Victoria, which it is said, if sold at the time, would have realised some forty thousand
pounds. The Colonial Secretary, Mr. Foster, took charge of the administration from
the time of Mr. La Trobe’s departure until the arrival of Sir Charles Hotham.
“ The Queen of the South,” with Sir Charles and Lady Hotham on board,
accompanied by Captain Kaye, private secretary to His Excellency, and Mrs. Kaye,
entered Hobson’s Bay on June 22, 1854. On the following morning Sir Charles
and Lady Hotham landed on the Sandridge pier. The enthusiasm attending their
reception was intense. The procession which was formed extended from Sandridge
nearly to Prince’s Bridge, and the route was lined with spectators, who lustily cheered
the Governor and his lady. On the bridge a triumphal arch was 'erected, on which
was inscribed the civic motto, “ Victoria welcomes Victoria’s choice.” After the
official proclamation that His Excellency had assumed the government of the colony,
he addressed the people briefly, and in some remarks that he let fall, it was made
evident that he was one who would not be influenced by personal motives or political
factions.
Sir Charles Hotham, K.C.8., was the son of the Kev. Frederick Hotham,
prebendary of Kochester, and late rector of Bennington, Suffolk. He was the
grandson of the second Lord Hotham, one of the barons of the Court of Exchequer ;
his mother was Anne Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Thomas Hallett Hodges, Esq.,
of Hemsted Place, Kent. Young Hotham was born in 1800, and entered the
British navy on November C, 1818; was present at the engagement between the boats
of the “ Naiad ” and a brig-of-war, alongside the walls of the fortress of Bona. In


September, 1825, he was made a lieutenant in the “ Revenge,” 76 guns, flagship of Sir
H. Burrard Neale, of the Mediterranean station; on May 15, 1826, appointed to the
“ Medina,” 20 guns ; on December 8, 1827, became first lieutenant of the “ Terror.”
In consequence of distinguishing himself on the occasion of the wreck of the
“ Terror ” he was promoted to the rank of commander on August 13, 1828, and, after
an interval on half-pay, he was appointed to the “Cordelia,” 10 guns. Returning
home in October, 1833, he received a post-captaincy, in compliment to the memory
of his uncle, Vice-Admiral Hon. Sir Henry Hotham, K.C.B. His next appointment
was to the “ Gorgon,” on the South American coast, on November 25, 1842 ; in
November, 1845, in conjunction with several British ships and a small French force,
Captain Hotham ascended the Parana, and in an engagement in the same month,
with a force of 180 seamen and 150 marines, at Punta Obligado, against General
Rosas and four heavy batteries, altogether consisting of nearly ten times as many
men, defeated the latter. For this service he was nominated a K.C.B. in March,
1846. In 1852 Lord Derby’s Government sent him on a joint mission with a French
officer to Brazil and the Republics of the River Plate. Having succeeded in the
mission, that of promoting peace among them, and of opening up the trade and
navigation of the river, Her Majesty, on account of the zeal and ability he displayed,
was induced to appoint him Governor of Victoria. Sir Charles Hotham, owing to the
training he had received, and the service he saw, must needs have been a man
differently moulded to Mr. La Trobe. Sir Charles married on December 10, 1853,
the Hon. Jane Sarah Wood, daughter of Lord Bridport.
As an instance of the enthusiasm displayed on the occasion of his advent we
give the poem greeting his landing. It was entitled “ The Arrival.”
He comes —an honest British tar,
From our own island Home afar.
Give him loyal, cordial greeting !
Greeting, in our Sovereign’s name,
Greeting, to his stainless fame ;
Greeting, for the rights we claim, —
Freemen, freeman meeting!
He comes —and with a modest air
Beside him is a lady fair,
Give her welcome, hearty cheering :
Hail her as Victoria’s pride—
A sailor’s child, a sailor’s bride,
Our Nelson’s granddaughter beside—
Proud memories and endearing !
He comes—and to his mighty task
He brings the manly strength we ask
The Avill that stems the ocean :
The swift resolve and high command :
The steady purpose, vigorous hand,
That steers the vessel safe to land
Calm amidst storm’s commotion !
He comes—and Hope sees in his train
The State freed from inaction’s strain,
Worth, vigor, talent showing—
The road, the rail, the news-wire’s coil
Belting the land—the teeming soil
Upheaving—“ Corn, and wine, and oil,”
And happiness o’erfiowing!
So coming, give him welcome here,
And to his honored partner dear,
Our gladdest greeting shew them !
Long, long in them may we rejoice,
Long bless our Sovereign lady’s choice,
Long hail his presence with one voice,
“ Long life to Sir Charles Hotham ! ”
The sequel shows how dashed to the ground were the hopes of the poet.


These are the words he addressed to the large assemblage which had gathered
to give him, perhaps, the most enthusiastic reception that a Governor of Victoria
ever received :—“ I desire to render you my most sincere thanks for the very cordial
welcome which you have extended to me, an unknown stranger, on the occasion of my
landing on your shores. I have the honor to be the Queen’s representative, and must
consider the honor as paid to my office, and therefore, to the Queen through me. In
the Queen’s name, therefore, I thank you. I shall take the first opportunity of
notifying to the Queen and to the British Government how I have been received,
and I have no doubt that Her Majesty will be glad to hear of the flattering reception
that has been given to her representative. The indications of wealth which your
city presents, are calculated to impress a stranger coming into it for the first time, and
I have been struck with the evidences of progress, both social and commercial, that
have met my view. I hope my career will be such as to meet your approval.
Mine will be a government of an honest heart, and of a head that will turn neither to
the right nor to the left, and will regard no object but its duty. Again I thank you.”
These sentiments revealed the man that had to be dealt with, and who, in
doing his duty, owing to its responsibility and the harassing of mind and body which he
underwent, contracted an illness which laid him in his grave. Had he possessed as much
of the tact of the diplomatist as he did ability, he would have been a most successful
Governor. At the very outset of his career, disappointment to many who surmised that
he was cautious and experienced, was occasioned by his giving expression to the most
ultra-democratic principles—that all power proceeded from the people. Indeed, so far
had he gone with these views, that the ultra-Liberals, although apparently gratified,
could hardly understand their drift. The diggers and people, pleased with being patted
on the back, received these words most gratefully. They believed that they had obtained
a Governor who would do them justice and redress their wrongs, of which it must be
said they had many inflicted on them. To those men, while admitting that he
had an honest heart, these words occasioned grave surprise.
The first levee held by Sir Charles Hotham took place on July 1, 1854, the
third anniversary of separation.
The difficulties with which he had to grapple should have caused him to act with
the utmost prudence, but not only did he lack that virtue, but also the support of his
Executive Council, who rendered him very little assistance. He found the whole of
the affairs of the Government totally disorganised. He endeavored to introduce some
necessary reforms, which would cause inquiries to be made into matters that might
reveal some acts calculated to bring disgrace on the officials.
Having travelled greatly in foreign lands, he knew a good deal of the world
and its ways. He is said to have been imperious in manner, but that was more
apparent than real, and could be accounted for through his having been so long
accustomed to command and to be obeyed. His constitution, having been weakened
by exposure in foreign and unhealthy climates, and his mind having been racked by
the intrigues of some of the factious ones, began to give way. His great fault was


that objection was taken to him by those who did not wish too close a scrutiny on his
part as to the manner in which appointments were made, or as to how the funds were
spent. Warned by the Duke of Newcastle in London of the heavy and wasteful
expenditure practised in Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham demanded on his airival from
the Auditor-General, Mr. Grimes, a statement of the public accounts. Mi. Ghildeis,
who succeeded Mr. Ebden as Auditor-General, introduced an Imprest system, but
this step made confusion worse confounded. When Sir Charles caused inquiry, in
1854, to be made, he found that under this system £1,682,328 were unadjusted —that
the expenditure could not be met by the revenue. In this state of affairs he invited
Mr. William Hamilton Hart, a leading merchant, and Mr. H. C. Macarthur, chief
officer in the Bank of Australasia, to join the Committe of Finance, of which the
Auditor-General was President. This action alarmed many of the officials, as well as
Mr. Childers, who on the death of Mr. Cassell, Collector of Customs, succeeded to
that office. They knew the Imprest system was doomed, and objected to interference
with patronage. In September the Committee brought up their repoit, in which the
abolition of the Imprest system was advised. Of the £1,682,328 unadjusted, no less
than £1,310,238 should have been adjusted, and there was a sum of £238,745
“ wholly unaccounted for.” While the Committee was investigating the public
accounts, Mr. Foster with others were preparing their estimates for 1855. These
estimates contemplated a total expenditure of £4,887,866, while the probable income
was anticipated to be £2,661,250, of which amount the unappropriated moiety of
territorial revenue of £670,000 was to help to make it up. These estimates
accordingly exhibited (in the year) a deficit of £2,226,616. The Finance Committee
recommended, on the 15th November, 1854, that the expenditure on public buildings
in excess of the funds available should be dependent on the raising of money by
debentures. They further recommended an increase on Customs duties to assist in
making up the deficiency in the ordinary revenue, and that debentures should be sold
in Europe to meet the debt to the Corporation and to the Banks to the foimer
there being £200,000 owing, and to the latter £400,000. At this particular juncture the
Ballarat affair was engaging the Governor’s attention, and it will be well, therefore,
before proceeding any further with the political history of Victoria, to give an account
of the origin, progress, and result of what may be termed more a social than a
political question—the Ballarat riots —which we shall describe, after having related in
a very brief manner the history of the settlement of Ballarat.


CHAPTER XI.
DISAFFECTION AND REBELLION AT
BALLARAT.
1 Q 5 4.
dmm ie aw ie assoc i a^on °f i^ ea s, it is impossible to
SlMi mention or read the name Ballarat without the thought of gold springing
D'SIpP np in man’s presence chamber. For a seaport town to increase rapidly
is natural, since it is the entrance through which all imports and exports must
pass; but when a town like Ballarat attains the position it enjoys, surely it
becomes a source of wonder—and Ballarat is a wonder. In the month of August,
1837, a party consisting of Mr. Thomas Livingstone Learmonth; Mr. D’Arcy,
a surveyor; Dr. Thompson, late of Geelong; Mr. David Fisher, then manager
of the Derwent Company, Tasmania; Captain Hutton, of the East India
Company’s Service; and Mr. Henry Anderson, started from the Corio—now
Geelong—to explore the unknown country to the north-west, taking with them
the necessary equipment and provisions. Seeing from Bellpost Hill a mount
to the north-west, they made towards it, and thus reached Mount Buninyong.
Lake Burrumbeet, and the distant ranges of the Pyrenees and the Grampians, were
seen by them from the mount. Descending from the mount, the party divided, but
owing to several mishaps, nothing came of the expedition. In January, 1838, a
second attempt to explore the country was made by Messrs. J. Aitken, Henry
Anderson, Thomas L. Learmonth, Somerville L. Learmonth, and William Yuille.
They started from Mr. Aitken’s house at Mount Aitken, and made towards Mount
Alexander, where at that time a party of “ overlanders ” from Sydney, consisting of
Messrs. C. H. Ebden, Yaldwin, and Mollison, were camping. Following the course
of the Loddon, they passed over country of the resources of which they never dreamt,
it since having been proved to be auriferous to a great degree. Journeying on, they
came to a peak, now known as Ercildoune. Lake Burrumbeet, the water of which
was intensely salt and very shallow, became quite dry in the following year—lB39


and remained so for several succeeding summers. The country was covered with
rank vegetation, from which, after having been burnt off, good pasturage could
be obtained.
This country was occupied during 1838, and in a few years afterwards other
settlers took up all the district as far westward as the Hopkins River. A change
since that time has certainly taken place, for what are now the boroughs of Ballarat,
Ballarat East and Sebastopol, was then a pastoral country. Only a few settlers with
their sheep and cattle, gave evidences of civilisation, and it was not until the discovery
of gold that Ballarat, like an unexpected comet, shot into the universe. Two men,
Thomas Dunn and Richard Turner, each claim to have been the first to discover gold
at Ballarat. The news of the discovery spreading like wildfire, a good many people,
including clergymen, doctors, merchants and others, arrived. In two days fifty pounds
weight of gold was found by two men named Esmond and Cavenagh—the latter being
the first to send gold to England. On September 20th the first gold license was
issued at Ballarat. A demand to pay license fees was so unpalatable, that a meeting
was held, which protested by a large majority against paying the fees. Before
the end of the first week 100 diggers had reached the Point where immense “ finds”
were being had, a circumstance which actually caused the whole of the colonists to
become crazy with excitement.
An extract from Mr. La Trobe’s despatch at this date to Earl Grey will convey
a tolerably good idea of how matters stood : “ The ships in the harbor are in a great
measure deserted, and masters of vessels, like farmers, have made up parties with
their men to go shares at the diggings. Both here and at Geelong all buildings and
contract works, public and private, are at a standstill.”
He told Earl Grey there were 500 cradles at work; the population numbered
2,500, which was being increased by the arrival of at least 500 persons daily; and
that he saw 8 lbs. of gold washed from two tin dishes of dirt.
Amongst those who went to the diggings was the late Sir J. Palmer. Lady
A’Beckett, wife of the Chief Justice, with her party of friends, paid the fields a visit,
and Governor La Trobe also visited the scene of these undreamt-of wonders.
Shortly after Governor Hotham arrived in Melbourne, he visited the country
districts, and made a tour of the goldfields. At Ballarat, Avoca, Maryborough,
Castlemaine and Sandhurst, his reception was no less enthusiastic than what he
experienced on landing in Melbourne. At Sandhurst his horses were taken from the
carriage, and it was dragged through the town by a number of men. At Geelong, at the
banquet given to him, he made the fatal mistake of declaring that all power proceeded
from the people. When the representative of the Queen utters such a sentiment as
this, it does not require any effort to fan into a flame the cravings of that class of
society which is always bemoaning its fate. In times such as those of which we are
writing, no more impolitic speech than this could have been given expression to. It
created a lawlessness which exhibited itself to such an extent as to render a resort to


force necessary for its suppression—the Ballarat riots. It must, however, be said that
at the bottom of the whole affair was the obnoxious administration of laws —in their
character, unjust, oppressive and unconstitutional. Dissatisfaction prevailed
everywhere on the goldfields, and the Camp officials were conspicuous for their
insolence. At Ballarat the authorities were even more than ordinarily unpopular, and
this unpopularity was increased by the finding of the magistrate in the case of
Scobie’s alleged murderer.
In these early days of digging life recklessness often figured prominently.
There was an immense trade done by the publicans, and many of those on the fields
succumbed from the effects of brandy drinking. Prices of goods and labour were
exorbitant. In 1853 cartage from Geelong to Ballarat was TBO per ton, and it is said
that one publican for several months, paid TISOO a week for cartage.
At first, Divine service used to be held by a few Wesleyans, in a mia-mia, but
afterwards, for the sake of greater decorum, the adjacent bush was selected, and
eventually they worshipped in a hut on Winter’s Flat, and in a tent at the White Flat.
The Wesleyans built the first place of worship near Sinclair’s Hill, which was named
by them Wesley Hill. Shortly after this the Anglicans, who had been holding
service in what was then the Police Court, in Ballarat West, built a small wooden
church in Armstrong-street. The Press following closely on the pulpit, the first
paper, the Ballarat Times and Southern Cross, appeared in March, 1854. The diggers,
moreover, were enabled to see the gay as well as the grave side of life, many theatres
springing up, the first theatrical performance being held in a canvas house put up in
the Gravel Pits. The first magistrate for Buninyong was Mr. Eyre, and the first
attorney Mr. Adam Loftus Lynn, the latter gentleman coming with the “ rush ”
which set in on the report of the first large nugget found in Canadian Gully in
February, 1858. The nugget found in Dalton’s Flat during the visit of Sir Charles
and Lady Hotham weighed 98J lbs., and was called the “ Lady Hotham,” in honour
of the Governor’s wife. Dismissing the interesting and thrilling subject of the early
settlement of Ballarat, we now come upon troublous times. A man named James
Scobie was found murdered near the Eureka Hotel, Ballarat, on the morning of
October 7th, 1854. It appears that late in the evening of October 6th, two men
knocked at the door of this hotel, which was kept by a man named Bentley, and
asked the proprietor to give them some liquor ; this he refused to do, as he had
closed for the night, whereupon the men became excited, and commenced to abuse
Bentley and his wife.
Bentley rushed out to chastise them for their language. In the scuffle which
ensued Scobie was struck by a blow with a spade, which proved fatal. Bentley, who
was an ex-convict from Tasmania, was arrested and brought before J. Dewes, the
police magistrate, but was discharged, the decision of the magistrate, as may well be
imagined, being received with the utmost indignation and astonishment. This man
Dewes, who is reputed to have been a corrupt creature, was appointed in 1853 by


Mr. La Trobe, who could have known nothing of his character. It was commonly
believed that Dewes had an interest in this disreputable hotel; hence his decision.
Anyhow, a man who was examined before a Commission in December 1854, swore on
oath that he bribed Dewes with £2OO to obtain for him two licenses —an auctioneer’s
and a wholesale spirit license. On the 20th of November the diggers, who were
exasperated over Bentley’s acquittal, held a monster demonstration upon the spot
where Scobie had met his death. Excitement increased as the speakers pointed out
that it was here where Scobie lost his life. The cry then arose, “ Secure Bentley,
and deliver him over again to justice !’’ which was followed by another, “ Down with
the house! burn it!” The house was immediately surrounded, but Bentley, who
foresaw what was going to happen, mounted a fleet horse and escaped into the bush.
The house was burned to the ground. Three men, who were considered the
ringleaders in this incendiary act, were arrested and tried at the Supreme Court in
Melbourne, before Mr. Justice Barry.
The trial ended in the conviction of MTntyre, Fletcher, and Westerby, on
whom sentence of three, four and six months’ imprisonment was respectively passed.
The jury recommended the prisoners to mercy, adding that such a painful task would
not have devolved on them had those entrusted with official matters at Ballarat
performed their duty properly. This was received with vociferous cheering in the
crowded court. When news reached Ballarat of the conviction of MTntyre, Fletcher,
and Westerby, the Reform League sent a deputation to Melbourne to “demand ” the
release of the prisoners. The Governor intimated to the secretary of the League that
if the Government were memorialised in a proper and becoming manner, the
prisoners might be released.
Rumours having spread abroad that the delegates had been arrested, another
monster meeting was determined on by the diggers at Ballarat, and consequently
despatches were forwarded by the camp officials for more troops. On Monday,
November 27th, the delegates, with the Reform League secretary, waited on Sir
Charles Hotham to present the petition. The Governor informed them that no
departure from the principle of the British Constitution —the verdict of a jury—could
in this case be allowed, at the same time stating that necessary reforms would be
introduced.
Preparations were now made by the authorities to prevent any disturbance
arising, and consequently all the available military and police were held in readiness.
The ill-feeling of the people was manifested by frequent attacks on the detachments
of troops. A party of soldiers belonging to the 40th, while marching from Geelong
to Ballarat, was attacked. They retaliated, but being overpowered, were obliged to
retreat to the camp, A similar occurrence took place on the same day near the
Eureka, where the military were attacked, several of them being severely injured.
Bentley had again been taken into custody, and, on being brought to trial,
was found guilty of manslaughter. At the great meeting which took place on




First Store at Warragul
ERECTED BY JAMES BIRAM 1876.


November 30th, crowds of armed diggers attended, and an insurrection flag was hoisted.
Mr. T. Hayes was chairman, and the principal speakers were Messrs. Kennedy,
Humffray, Eoss, Murnane, Wheatley, Black, Quinn, Yorn, Brady, Lalor, Weeks, and
Eeynolds. Eesolutions were passed denouncing the license fee as an obnoxious and
unjustifiable tax on free labor, and that the meeting would take immedate steps to
abolish the fee, by burning all their licenses; that it would be utterly inconsistent,
after refusing to pay the license fee, to ask the Commissioner to adjust
disputes about their claims, and that therefore they would refer the
matter to arbitrators chosen mutually from amongst themselves. The most
active agents were chiefly foreigners and Irishmen ; the latter felt very
indignant at being considered ready to rise against authority, and denounced as
calumniators those who considered them in such a light. It was decided, on the
motion of Mr. P. Lalor, to hold a meeting of the Eeform League on Sunday, December
3rd, at 2 p.m., at the Adelphi Theatre, for the purpose of electing a Central
Committee. A determination was arrived at to protect no man after December 15th
who had not joined the League.
The last resolution, one is disposed to fancy, was regarded as a joke.
It was proposed by Mr. Humffray, and seconded by Mr. Kennedy.
It protested “ against the common practice of bodies of military marching
into a peaceable district with fixed bayonets!” “ and that if Government officials
continue to act thus unconstitutionally, we cannot be responsible for similar or worse
deeds from the people.” Licenses were burned, guns and revolvers discharged, and
League tickets of membership distributed. All this time troops were in readiness in
the gully beneath the camp in case of an outbreak. Sir Charles Hotham was not
the man to be overawed by numbers, and accordingly gave instructions that
licenses should be examined as heretofore. On November 30th, Commissioner
Johnstone went to the Gravel Pits for the purpose of examining the licenses, but he
and the escort of police accompanying him were pelted with stones. More police
were sent to his assistance, and Commissioner Eede appeared upon the scene. When
requested by the mob to send away the police, he told them that the law while in force
must be maintained, and appealed to the more moderate to retire. Owing to a rumor
that Yern and Lalor’s men were expected from Eureka, the Kiot Act was read and
the military sent for. This had the effect of dispersing the mob, but at certain places
the diggers made a stand and used stones and firearms. One policeman’s head was
cut open. Some prisoners were taken, but on the return of the troops to the camp,
the Australian flag of blue, with a white cross, was again hoisted. More soldiers
were needed to enable the military to assume offensive tactics.
The diggers knelt around the flag and swore to not surrender. Peter Lalor, a
native of Queen’s County, Ireland, was chosen “ Commander-in-Chief” of the diggers,
and issued warrants and manifestoes. A mass meeting was held on Bakery Hill, when
Lalor swore in his followers ; then drilling commenced. Lalor pressed horses and


everything necessary into his service for carrying on the campaign. A letter was
written to the delegates who had that day gone to Creswick, soliciting the aid of the
Creswick diggers. When the letter was read by Black to the meeting he was
addressing, it wai determined to send assistance, and a large body of men, headed
by Kennedy, started for Ballarat. The Creswick contingent rendered very little help to
the Ballarat diggers, as they by degrees left, owing to the indifferent accommodation
afforded them, so that very lew remained to assist their mates. On the same night,
the 80th, a deputation, in which was Carboni Baffaello, an Italian, and a Homan
Catholic priest named Smith, was sent to the camp to demand the release of the
prisoners, but Mr. Bede refused to release those captured for assaulting the police.
The priest returned at midnight to repeat the request, but he received a
similar answer. All work was suspended at Ballarat from this date. The diggers
established a patrol on the roads to Melbourne and Geelong to prevent reinforcements
arriving. They seized arms and ammunition, and a large body of armed men
paraded in sight ot the camp ; stores were robbed and arms were stolen. On the
night of the Ist of December lights were observed in the tents of the diggers, and
shots were fired at the sentries. Captain Thomas issued a public notice that lights
must be put out at eight o’clock, that firearms were not to be discharged under any
pretence, and that persons disobeying these orders would be fired at. As soon as the
intelligence of the proceedings at Ballarat was received by the authorities at
Melbourne, all the remaining available troops were sent up, with men-of-war’s men,
horses and foot police, four field-pieces, and a number of baggage and ammunition
waggons. Sir Robert Nickle, Commander-in-Ghief of the Eorces, proceeded to
Ballarat, to take command of the troops. A declaration of independence was drawn
up in Shannahan’s store, which breathed revolution and a republic. On the Ist of
December Mr. Commissioner Amos arrived at the camp at Ballarat, and stated that
the diggers were occupying an entrenched position at the Eureka, with the intention
of intercepting the troops under the Major-General, who was expected to arrive from
Melbourne. Captain Thomas, being unable to attack the insurgents by day, as he had
not a force sufficient to leave behind for the protection of the camp, resolved upon a
night surprise. The diggers did not expect that any active measures on the part of
the authorities would be taken until the arrival of the reinforcements. As it was
Sunday morning a large portion of them was away. The insurgents were posted
in a very advantageous position in a fortified camp or stockade at the Eureka it
rested on a slight eminence. It is said that it was much too large, and was not
sufficiently protected by outworks. Notwithstanding these defects, had numbers of
the diggers not have been absent, and that the attack was unexpected, the military
would have been repulsed. The conjecture of Captain Thomas as to the numbers
who would be absent, and the general condition of those left behind, was correct.
Captain Thomas was assisted by Captain Pasley, E.E., who displayed great
bravery in advancing with the skirmishers, and directing the assault. Mr.


Commissioner Amos acted as guide, and through his intimate knowledge of the
locality, led the troops to the exact spot where operations were to commence. Just
as morning began to dawn the troops reached the ground. The total number of men
under the command ol Captain Thomas was 276, 100 of these being mounted. The
camp was left in charge ol Captain Atkinson, 12th regiment.
When the troops reached the scene of the assault on the Stockade, they were
disposed as follows : —Part ol the mounted force was thrown forward to threaten the
left flank and rear ol the place; the remainder, with the foot police, were kept in
reserve; while the 12th and 40th detachments were extended in skirmishing order,
with supports in front ol the entrenchment, and a barrier of ropes, slabs, stakes, and
overturned carts. Alter several volleys had been fired on both sides, “ The Fighting
40th, one of whom, Sergeant Kingdon, now at Wolseley in South Australia, has
related to the writer many thrilling accounts of the Ballarat riots, maintained their
reputation, and the entrenchment was carried. The foot police were first over the
barricade, and one of them climbed the flagstaff under a heavy lire, and carried off
the insurrection flag, but it was not without a sharp light of about twenty-five
minutes that the military were the victors. The rebel leaders fought well; Mr. Peter
Lalor was wounded in the breach, and left for dead, whilst several were cut
down at their posts. The tents within the enclosure and in the immediate vicinity
were burned down. The dead and wounded, who were brought in carts into the
camp, were covered with blood, and a proof of their manliness is gathered from the
fact that they were all shot in the breast. The number of insurgents killed is roughly
estimated at from thirty-live to forty, besides a great many wounded, many of whom
died from the effects. Of the troops, three privates were killed, and several wounded,
one of whom died. Captain Wise, in leading his men to the attack, was severely
wounded, and died in a few days afterwards ; and Lieutenant Paul, who with Captain
Quendo was in charge of sixty-five men of the 12th Regiment, also received a
severe wound.
Had it not been that the defenders of the Stockade were, as is well known,
short of ammunition, the probabilities are that the loss sustained by the troops would
have been considerable. Among the arms taken in the fight were some rudely
constructed pikes, hurriedly made, and furnished with a sort of hooked knife to cut
the bridles of the cavalry. The dead were buried the same day in the cemetery. The
bodies of insurgents, placed in coffins, were laid in a separate grave ; some of them
were removed by their friends. The funerals were attended by several hundred men,
who marched three abreast up the main road and past the camp.
The number of prisoners taken was 125, amongst them being Eaffaello, who,
with others, were dismissed on the spot, as not having been concerned in the fighting.
This fiery-headed Italian was, however, subsequently arrested as a well-known leader.
The total number of prisoners, reported by Captain Thomas, on December 3, after
the release of those who could not be identified as forming part of the men at the


Stockade, was 114. Yern, the commander-in-chief of the “ forces of the Republic of
Victoria,” escaped, and a reward of <£soo was offered for his apprehension. Mr.
Lalor lost his right arm in the engagement, and for his apprehension, as well as that
of Black, a reward of £2OO each was offered. None of them were ever arrested.
Black was not present when the assault on the Stockade took place. Lalor, who had
been severely wounded, was covered by one of his friends with slabs, till the soldiers
withdrew, when he left his hiding-place, exhausted by the loss of blood. Receiving
shelter in a hut on the ranges, he was on the following night (December 4) conveyed
to Father Smith’s house, where his arm was amputated by Dr. Doyle. After running
many narrow escapes of being captured, which was only prevented by his friends
concealing him till the excitement had subsided, he was removed to Geelong, where
he underwent further surgical operations, the authorities appearing to have
relinquished the intention of pursuing him any longer. Much dispute afterwards
arose as to whether the members in the Stockade exceeded the attacking force. Of
course, the rioters, to keep consistent with their riotous character, would make what
may be termed riotous statements, and consequently they asserted that they were
outnumbered. Ample evidence could be adduced to prove that the contrary was the
case. They averred there were not 300 men in the Stockade when the attack
was made, but from the most reliable data there were at least 1400 men in the Stockade
after midnight.
One other individual’s name may be mentioned as being connected with the
affair at the Stockade —McGill, who, it was rumoured at one time, shot Captain
Wise. It would, however, be impossible to believe the story of a man such as he
was. Failing, according to his own account, in securing, in company with some
others, two field-pieces that were said to be on Captain Hepburn’s property at
Smeaton, he was obliged to disguise himself and fly. He was furnished with
woman’s attire, and travelled by coach on December sth, passing Sir Robert Nickle
and his troops on their way up near to the Moorabool. He was an American, and
earnest entreaties were made on his behalf by his countrymen. Sir Charles
Hotham’s clemency allowed this man to leave the country.
On Tuesday, December 6th, a public meeting was held in Melbourne to
consider the best means for the preservation of the peace of the colony.
The meeting was to have been held in the Mechanics’ Institution, but, owing
to the large number of persons who were unable to obtain admission, an
adjournment was made to the space in front of the City Court-house, Swanston
Street. Several motions were carried, one of which was proposed by Mr. Hibberd,
and shows clearly the hatred manifested towards Mr. Foster:—“ That in the
opinion of this meeting the most easy, self-evident, and speedy means of settling
this very unhappy difference, and establishing the peace of the colony on a firm
basis, is the immediate dismissal of Secretary Foster.”
The reading of the resolution was followed by the most enthusiastic
cheering.


It is not difficult to imagine in what state Ballarat must have been at this
time. The law-abiding colonists were terrified, inasmuch as foreigners and disloyal
subjects —anarchists—were prime movers in an attempt to overthrow all authority.
When, however, Sunday, December 3rd, came, they found that the sting of
rebellion had been drawn, and that a prospect of leading a peaceful life was near at
hand. A notice of December 3rd, signed by Mr. Rede, President-Commissioner,
stated that “Her Majesty’s Forces were this morning fired upon by a large body ol
evil-disposed persons of various nations, who had entrenched themselves in a stockade
on the Eureka, and some officers and men killed or wounded. Several of the rioters
have paid the penalty of their crime, and a large number are in custody. All
well-disposed persons are earnestly requested to return to their ordinary occupations
and to abstain from assembling in large groups, and every protection will
be afforded to them by the authorities.” On the night of December 4th, some shots
were fired into the Camp, and received a prompt reply; but this act can only be
regarded as the intoxicated bluster of a few desperadoes. Whatever effect the
repulse at the Stockade may have had on the spirits of the diggers, it is
unquestionable that it reanimated those who supported the Government.
On December 5 Sir Robert Nickle, with the troops under him, marched into
Ballarat. He was an old and experienced officer, and withal most sympathetic. He
restrained the violence of the police and military, and his conciliatory manner
towards the diggers produced a good effect. This behaviour of his, together with the
resignation of the much-abused Chief Secretary, Mr. Foster, and the appointment
of a commission, caused their animosity to subside. Sir Charles Hotham transmitted
two proclamations, dated December 4, to Sir Robert Nickle. One was a proclamation
of martial law in a district containing Ballarat, to be in force from noon on December 6,
and prohibiting the importation of arms or food thereto without the consent of the
Governor; the other gave authority to all officers to employ Her Majesty’s forces to
use martial law in the suppression of rebellion and punishment of rebels; but the
Governor reserved to himself the prerogative of sentence to death. Melbourne stood
affiiast when the news of affairs at Ballarat reached the metropolis. The wildest
rumours were circulated; special constables were constantly throughout the day
being sworn in. Meetings were held, some to sympathise with the diggers, others
to uphold law and order. It must be borne in mind that it was owing to a few
miserable creatures that the dissatisfaction existing amongst the diggers bore
fruit in open rebellion. The petition adopted at a mass meeting held on January
13 1855, in Swanston-street, for a general amnesty of the State prisoners, puts the
case plainly. It runs as follows The recent unhappy outbreak at Ballarat was
induced by no feeling of disaffection to the person of Her Majesty, and by no
traitorous designs against the institutions of the monarchy, but purely by a sense of
political wrong, a loss of confidence in the local administration of law, and an
invitation engendered by the injudicious and offensive enforcement of an obnoxious
and invidious tax, which, though legal, has since been condemned by the goldfields’
commissioner.”

A public meeting was held at Bakery Hill on December 6. Regret was
expressed at the riotous and uncalled-for proceedings which rendered it necessary for
the authorities to take the steps they did.
Sir Robert Nickle, it was hoped by the meeting, would act with forbearance,
and it pledged itself to bring its grievances “in a constitutional manner ” before the
Legislature. Humffiay, one of the arch-agitators, and others, went to the camp as
a deputation, when this advocate of physical force only, not “ moral force only,” as
he claimed to be, was duly apprehended by the authorities. Sir Robert Nickle
liaving, on December sth, reported that the Ballarat district was peaceful, Sir Charles
Hotham, by a proclamation of December 6th, appointed that the withdrawal of
martial law should take place at noon on December 9th.
After magisterial inquiries were made by Messrs. Sturt and Webster, thirteen
men were arraigned, by the Attorney-General’s indictment, for treason. Raffaello was
one of them. Sixty-four witnesses were set down on the Crown brief, and three
panels of jurymen, numbering 178, were summoned for the trial. Mr. B. C.
Aspinall defended the prisoners gratuitously, and with him in the defence were
many of the foremost barristers. The prisoners were acquitted, a general amnesty
was granted, and the Government compensated every one who had suffered any loss,
11ns was ample reparation for past shortcomings. Lalor and Humffray were
returned to the first Parliament held under the new Constitution. Humffray was
the first Minister of Mines, and Lalor, who resigned the Speakership in 1887, held a
seat in Parliament from the date of his first election until his resignation of the
Chair. For a considerable period he filled on a salary tie office of Chairman of
Committees in the Legislative Assembly.


CHAPTER XII.
THE ERA OF RESPONSIBLE
GOVERN MENT.
«li HE Governor since his arrival in the colony certainly had his hands full
«||| There existed at this time a strong leeling to maintain in lorce the
Convicts’ Prevention Act, and he consequently was compelled to assent
on November 16, 1854, to the re-enactment of the measure. He explained to the
Home authorities that it was absolutely necessary to affix his signature to the Bill,
since, in the event of his refusing to do so, it was highly probable that the people
would have felt themselves so aggrieved, that they would have taken the law into
their own hands, on the grounds that no alternative had been pioposed to them.
While Sir Charles was maturing his plans for reform, the formation of the Ballarat Befoim
League, and the adoption on November 11 of a code for its guidance, took place. He
was aware of the serious aspect of the Ballarat case some weeks befoie the
outbreak, and accordingly he appointed a Commission of Enquiry, of which Mi. W.
C. Haines was to be chairman, and Messrs. Williams, J. P. 1 awkneiq J. McCulloch,
J.'f. Strachan, W. H. Wright (Chief Gold Commissioner), and E. Grimes, were to
be members. It is difficult to understand why this Commission should have been so
tardy in undertaking the duties imposed on it. It reached Ballarat on 17th
December. The outbreak showed to its members the seriousness of the task they
were required to perform. During the remainder of the month of December and part
of January, 1854-5, they were engaged in investigations. They also visited Creswick,
Castlemaine, and Bendigo. They were to report on the whole question of
administration at the goldfields, and the raising of revenue therefrom. They were
to be unfettered in their labors, and were allowed to use to the fullest extent their
judgment, the Governor in one instance suggesting that an export duty of one
shilling an ounce on gold might be sufficient, as he did not think it would lead to
smuggling or consequences of a worse nature, and added that he teared a highei
rate might have grave objections. On November 23rd the financial message,
furnished to the Legislative Council, showed a deficit in the general revenue of
T354,000, and in the territorial revenue of T731,000. To return to the commission.
They’arrived in Melbourne on January 8, and informed the Governor that, owing to


the mass of evidence they had obtained, it would take some weeks before the report
would be ready. They recommended the abolition of the license fee. In reply to
their letter of January 10th, which urged the Governor to release the prisoners awaiting
their trial for the Ballarat outbreak, and to grant a general amnesty, Sir Charles
Hotham said that the subject had already been under the serious consideration ot
himself and the Executive Council, and that the Council concurred with his decision
in declining to accede to the request. They made a final report on March 27. Mr.
Haines, the chairman, was very much averse to attaching his signature to the
document, because it abstained from pronouncing as to the guilt or innocence of the
officers on the goldfields, against whom frequent charges had been brought. This
report proposed that the whole system of goldfields’ management be re-constituted.
The commission recommended an export duty of 2s. 6d. an ounce, a fee of T1 a year
lor a miner’s right, and that the miner’s right should qualify for the franchise. This
latter recommendation was tantamount to the principle of manhood suffrage—a
principle which was shortly afterwards adopted for the whole colony, when
responsible government was conceded. It was found that about this time
the miner’s earnings were found to be lower, on an average, than some other
branches of colonial labour. Local elective mining courts were recommended,
and benches of unpaid justices of the peace, who should sit with the paid
magistrate. The title of “ Commissioner ” it was deemed advisable to change to
the old English title of Warden, since the former carried with it unpleasant
memories. They urged that land should be sold largely in the vicinity of the
goldfields, in order that people might settle on the soil; only 44,000 acres having been,
up to this time, sold in the vicinity of the goldfields. With regard to the Chinese
they recommended that a fine, of not less than TlO a head, be levied on every Chinese
immigrant arriving, in excess of the number of hands required to work a vessel.
This closes the history of a disturbance, attended with a serious loss of life, and of
which it is hoped there will never again in Victoria arise a contingency productive of
similarly disastrous results.
One remarkable woman—Mrs. Caroline Chisholm—figures prominently in
the history ol the colonisation ol Victoria about tLis period, when a spirit of
restlessness and discontent existed amongst the population. This lady saw the grave
necessity ol arresting this dissatisfaction, which was due to a variety of circumstances,
the most potent being, no doubt, the want ot homes. In a new country it was
impossible to obtain, and unreasonable to expect, a condition of things such as those
immigrants experienced in their native land, but the impossibility or unreasonableness
in any case is always lost sight ot when we feel ourselves aggrieved. To
counteract this discontent, Mrs. Chisholm conceived the plan ol having a moral and
family emigration, as it has been styled, to the colony, Napoleon, in reply to the
question, what was it that France needed most, said “ Mothers,” and Mrs. Chisholm
—an empress ol minds and hearts—thought that Victoria needed Homes. When
she first took up the cause of emigration, she found a state of affairs existing which
ought not to have existed. Men, women and children, single and married, were

huddled on board ship with so little care, that discomfort and immorality prevailed.
It must be borne in mind that before Mrs. Chisholm entered this held of reform
much had been accomplished in the way of remedying these evils, but nevertheless
much remained to be still effected. One of her great objects was to induce not only
families, but groups of families, who were perhaps struggling with difficulties at
home, to emigrate to the colony together, so that all on landing in a strange country
might do so with family connections. When famine and distress were in the land in
1841, particularly in Sydney, and when there was nothing in the coffers of the State to
relieve it, she went among the rich merchants and induced them to give her drays.
These drays she divided into three classes ; one for young men, a second for young
women, and a third for married persons. With this phalanx, she advanced into the
almost unknown interior, and there she comfortably settled those whom she rescued
from starvation in Sydney. The Argus of October 2nd, 1854, in an article entitled
“ The ‘ Stranger’ and his Friend,” says : “Considering how much Mrs. Chisholm has
done with very small means, we should like to see what she would effect with very
large ones. And in being provided with ample funds from our land revenue, and
with a voice of authority in the management of our public affairs, this extraordinary
woman would indeed receive a ‘ testimonial ’ which would be alike honorable to her
and advantageous to the colony. And neither the money nor Mrs. Chisholm could
be employed in any other way as well. We have lately devoted much of our space
and of our consideration to the subject of the ‘ unemployed ’ now represented as
existing amongst us. But here is a mother for them all ! * * * We
will defy anyone to suggest anything which would exercise a more beneficial
influence upon this colony and its future prospects, than that it should be known
over the whole world that we had granted unlimited powers to the great Mrs,
Chisholm, and had constituted her by public acclammation ‘ Protectress-General to
the Stranger.’ ”
Her husband was a Captain in the East Indian Army, and had visited
Australia on furlough. He returned to India but left his family in Sydney, where
she first engaged actively in her labour of love. She won the esteem of all; and
Sir George Gipps was one of the many who sung her praises. When she went to
England in 1846 she was presented by the colonists with a subscription and a
testimonial. In England she founded a Family Colonisation Society, over which
the late Earl of Shaftesbury presided. She also lectured on behalf of emigration.
In Melbourne, her services were so much appreciated that Parliament was requested
to vote her £SOOO, on condition of <£2500 being raised by public subscription and
otherwise.
On the 6th of December Mr. Foster officially announced to the House that he
had resigned his office as Colonial Secretary, and stated that the charge made against
him of abusing the patronage of the Government was false. Mr. Childers declared
to the Council that the resignation was due to Mr. Foster’s personal feeling, and did
not arise in any way from Sir Charles Plotham. On the same day a resolution was
moved by Mr. Henry Miller, and seconded by Mr. Foster, which expressed sympathy


with the Governor, and pledging the House to use every available means to assist him
in the restoration and maintenance of social order. The address was presented
by the Speaker and several members on December 7th, and the Governor expressed his
satisfaction with the unanimity of the Legislative Council of Victoria on the question
of the maintenance of the law.
The Governor, in his reply, reminded those assembled of the efforts he had
made to preserve the peace, and alluded to the dismissals of Dewes and a sergeant
ol police, the latter having been accused of corruption. The appointment of a
Commissioner was touched on, as well as the loyal petition, signed by fifteen hundred
miners at Forest Creek, declaring that they were the enemies of disorder. To return to
Mr. Foster. He knew that he was thoroughly disliked, and moreover the object of
suspicion; but in justice to him it may be said, notwithstanding what his detractors
may assert to the contrary, that he could not be held responsible for all the
misgovernment of the past. For a time he had been the chief executive officer under
Mr. La Trobe, and was consequently identified with the Government. The charges
against him were of a serious nature. He was accused of helping to waste the public
money, and of making numerous appointments to public office. It is appropriate to
allude, when discussing this subject, to the charges brought against Sir Charles
Hotham, for sanctioning lavish expenditure. When Sir Charles arrived in Melbourne
it was found necessary to provide a residence for him, and this duty devolved upon
Mr. Foster and his friends. The lease of a private house at Toorak, distant four miles
from Melbourne, was purchased. TIO,OOO was given as a bonus, in order to obtain
possession; and between January, 1854, and September, 1855, there was expended on
it, with the sanction of Sir Charles Hotham, a sum of T29,183 2s. 3d. for additions
and improvements, and T4,550 Bs. 4d. for furniture. Much of the expenditure was
incurred before Sir Charles Hotham was appointed Governor, and, notwithstanding
that the return, which was moved for in 1855, but was not produced until after his
death, proved such to be the case, he was not exonerated.
This expenditure was the cause of producing the statesmanlike (?) policy—
better call it retaliatory —of Mr. Childers and others to disseminate all sorts of wild
rumours, when the Governor appointed a Finance Commission. No doubt Mr.
Foster was much to blame in this matter, but considering the amount for the
Governor s residence to be small in comparison to the expenditure by the
colonists on luxuries for themselves, it would have been a gracious act to have
passed the matter over. It may be laid down as a maxim that the greatest
spendthrifts always deny to others but themselves the necessaries which make life
comfortable. They are the cannibals of society. Foster, fully grasping the situation,
and in order to maintain the integrity of a First Minister, in his resignation to the
Governor, said that he was unwilling to consult his own interests as superior to those
of the country. Sir Charles Hotham did not place any pressure upon Mr. Foster,
who, no doubt, sacrificed himself for the public good. It would be idle to accept the
opinions ol pot-house politicians or drunken diggers, whose sentiments were inspired
by the brandy bottle and not by reason, as to the merits or demerits of this


gentleman, who was succeeded by Mr. William Clarke Haines. It may be
said that responsible government had now commenced in reality. It was
ungenerous on the part of the people to brand Mr. Foster as solely responsible for the
misgovernment and mal-administration hitherto practised, since all who sat at the
board with him should have shared his disgrace. The people wanted a victim, and
they were willing to release Barabbas, in order to satiate their appetite for revenge.
Mr. Foster was quite right when he told the Governor that it was a question whether
a diggei delegate or Sir Charles Hotham should have the administration of the
public affairs of the colony. No doubt such outspoken language had the effect of
causing a lising, such as the Fenians practise in Ireland, amongst the lovers of
disorder and turmoil. With his disappearance from office there was a cessation of
intrigues for a time. Mr. Haines was considered an honest man, and on the whole,
lent a loyal support to the Governor. Soon after Mr. Haines was appointed Colonial
Secretary, Sii Charles Hotham offered the post of Acting-Treasurer (Captain
Lonsdale being absent) to Mr. Charles Sladen. In April, 1855, Messrs. Haines and
Sladen were placed on the Finance Committee, which, on November 14, sent in its
report. The Governor announced his entire approval of the scheme, and its
promulgation, as well as the notification of the Governor’s death, appeared in the
Gazette of January 1, 185 G. It formed the basis on which an Act was subsequently
passed (2nd October, 1857) “ for the collection and payment of the public moneys, the
audit of the public accounts, and the protection and recovery of public property.” On
December 15, 1854, a Martial Law Indemnity Bill was passed, and the Council
adjourned until January 30, 1865. The Council discussed at great length the
amended estimates which were laid on the table on February 7, 1855. They Refused
to sanction additional taxation, and in one or two instances slightly increased the
expenditure. The burden of cairying out the reform fell on the Governor and those
immediately connecte d with him. When Mr. Foster and his associates found that
the expendituie foi one yeai was reduced by over two millions sterling, much
indignation was exhibited by them against the Governor, who did not shrink from the
work which rendered the colony solvent. This task, in addition to his numerous
official duties, and the factious opposition which he experienced, told upon a constitution
enfeebled by exposure on the African coast and brought about his death, which
occurred on December 31, 1855. The Governor, in a despatch shortly before his
death, acknowledged that in coping with the difficulties which, on his arrival, beset
the colony, he had an able coadjutor in the work of reform in the person of Mr.
Haines. Governor Hotham’s labors bore fruit after his death—the cash balance in
the Treasury, after the payment of all liabilities, being T609,638.
As we have almost reached the period when colonial self-government came into
force, a brief sketch of the condition of the colony in the year preceding 1855 will tend
to enable the reader to form an estimate by comparison of the rapidity with which the
prosperity of Victoria thenceforward increased. It will be seen that the commercial
and financial position was not all which could be desired, but the social condition of
the inhabitants being on the whole very satisfactory, that friction which is felt when
a wave of depression is passing over a community was not experienced.


To those who have studied the course of events in this country up to 1854, it
must have become evident that a remarkable, and, on the whole, a very gratifying
change was effected in the aspect of society, particularly in reference to the pursuits
of the population and their occupation of the land. The history of the colony since
1851 demonstrates conclusively the aptitude of the Anglo-Saxon race for colonisation.
In the latter year, the population of the colony was 80,000, whereas in November,
1854, the number was nearly 300,000, so that in the brief space of three years,
upwards of 200,000 persons landed in Victoria. The population on the goldfields
was estimated to be between 70,000 and 80,000, and accordingly over 200,000
settled down throughout the country in various other industrial pursuits. The
progress made in everything dependent on the individual energy of the people was
even more surprising. One railway—from Melbourne to Hobson’s Bay —had been
completed, and two more, from Melbourne to Williamstown and Geelong respectively,
were in rapid progress. Then the intellectual wants of the people were not neglected,
for several philosophical societies had sprung into existence. Fishing companies,
vineyard companies, and a coal company for working the seams at Cape Paterson, were
in course of formation. During the year, no less than seven new goldfields were
discovered, and although they were all occupied and worked by industrious diggers,
yet it is gratifying to learn that cultivation and settlement had not been diminished
by the influence of gold. For the four weeks ending 18th November the net
immigration was 6580.
As regards trade, the reckless spirit which seems to have pervaded British
consignors in shipping goods to Melbourne alone in 1853, was glaringly displayed by
the amount consigned reaching the enormous sum of ,£14,068,351, with the result
that British manufactures in Melbourne could not be sold at a profit.
Notwithstanding that this fact was known in England, shipments in 1854 were made
to an equally excessive amount. The imports for the first three quarters of the year
amounted to £12,410,418, while those for the fourth quarter were estimated at
£3,000,000, the sum total showing an increase on 1853 of £1,312,167. The
consequences of the over-importation were most disastrous to the community,
since the glut causing a great depreciation in value, many speculators and retail
traders were tempted to purchase large quantities of goods with the hope of
a rise shortly ensuing ; but the continuous arrivals caused an enormous further
depreciation, and the speculators suffered very heavy losses. To this cause
many of the insolvencies which occurred then may be attributed. Another
factor which reduced the trade prospects was the universal system of
forced sales and sacrifices at auctions, which very seriously injured legitimate
business, both wholesale and retail, and caused a ruinous depreciation of
stocks. The cause of this very extraordinary position of trade is alleged to
have been due to “outsiders;” in other words, to those not regularly engaged
in the Australian trade. It had become a mania both in the United States and
Great Britain to consign goods to the gold countries. The American outsiders
destroyed the trade of California, which for a long time was at a low ebb ; and the


British outsiders brought about a similar condition of things to that in Australia. In
many instances, if a merchant gave an order to a manufacturer for goods for
Australia, his agent, and probably also the manufacturer, would send duplicate
shipments.
Had this madness existed in Australia, the consequences would have been
most calamitous. There was very little over-speculation, either in land or goods, and
nearly the whole of the disastrous results were traceable to over-importation. The
cause of the disaster is easily explained. The anticipation of a prosperous and
increasing business caused the merchants to build, or occupy at high rents, suitable
stores. Suddenly they found that the stock of goods they had purchased at a high
advance were not worth more than English invoice price, that they were unsaleable,
and that the high rent and expenses they had to undergo were eating away their
previous profits. This was the case with hundreds of mercantile men in Victoria,
and more especially was it felt by those engaged in the dry-goods business, of which
there was at least a two years’ supply, and of which it was found impossible to
dispose at original English cost. The financial condition of the colony was very
much affected by the long-continued stagnation in trade. The want of confidence
among traders suddenly curtailed, to an immense extent, the paper currency, more
particularly bills of exchange, with the result that the major portion of business
transactions took place in cash. It was estimated that the reduction in the amount
of bills discounted at the banks during the months of October and November
amounted to one million sterling. Several circumstances combined to prevent a
general insolvency, first in order being the general wealth of the community; next, a
population of 300,000 enjoyed the acquisition weekly of 40,000 ounces of gold, valued at
j£IGO,OOO ; thirdly, the extensive immigration of a respectable class, which brought with
them a large average of money or other property ; and lastly, the universal confidence in
the resources and future prosperity of the country, which has been maintained from
that time up to when the Victorian loan was floated in the present year (1888). In
the Argus of November 23, 1854, is contained the following sound piece of advice :
“ This new country affords a finer and more profitable field for the employment of
capital than any other in the world, but the investments must be judicious, and by
thoroughly trustworthy agents. In the colonies the inhabitants do not readily invest
in banks, because private enterprises, under their personal superintendence, are more
profitable. So, in like manner, if the English capitalist could combine colonial skill
in the management of colonial enterprises, he could at all times realise even larger
profits than those accruing to the banks. We throw out these remarks merely as
suggestions at present to English capitalists, and request them to study the
capabilities and resources of this country.” The average amount of wool shipped
during the years 1849, 1850, and 1851 amounted to 16,334,560 lbs, and the
production of this staple in the colony was increased during the gold period,
terminating with October, 1854, by upwards of 6,000,000.


THE COLONY OF VICTORIA UNDER
RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT.
1855-1863.
ANG to the importance which the Australian colonies had obtained in
l| consequence of the discovery of the goldfields, and the influx of population
resulting therefrom, the Imperial authorities felt disposed to meet colonial
views and wishes, which were all centred in the aspiration for constitutional self
government, and accordingly invited each colony to frame such a constitution for its
government as its representatives might consider most applicable to its own peculiar
circumstances. It was greatly due to the “ conciliatory spirit” of Sir John
Pakington’s despatch, acceding to the terms of Wentworth’s Remonstrance, that his
hope that “ a new and auspicious era in the government of Her Majesty’s Australian
colonies had commenced,” was realised. Wentworth’s Remonstrance was made in
May, 1851, was treated contemptuously by Earl Grey—a treatment against which a
protest was offered by the Legislative Council in Sydney—and was again renewed in
1852. Unwilling, however, to rest satisfied with the gracious reply of the Secretary
of State, he strove unsuccessfully to prevail on the Council to postpone the estimates
for 1853 until a reply to the remonstrance was received, but he succeeded in carrying,
by the narrow majority of one, a resolution to refuse supplies for 1854, unless a
favourable reply should be received. Earl Grey, in January, 1852, replied at great
length to the remonstrance of 1851, wherein he impeached the claim of the colonists
to control the waste lands of the Crown. The second remonstrance was presented
by Lord Naas on June 17, 1852. Objection was taken by Mr. Disraeli, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, to the sentiment in the petition which caused Her Majesty to be
only the trustee of her own dominions. After much discussion the petition was
received, and Sir John Pakington at a later period undertook to give careful
consideration to it. In the succeeding session the “ solemn protest and declaration
of the colony ” was called attention to by Sir William Molesworth, and Sir John
Pakington informed the House on December 10, 1852, that, in conjunction with his
colleagues, he had considered “ the very important statements it contained,” and
that they had arrived at a decision. The despatch containing the was
forwarded to the colonies on December 15, 1852. Copies were sent to Victoria and
South Australia, in order that these colonies might also enjoy the advantages
contained in the despatch.


It is to Wentworth that the success of the contest for that constitutional self
government which the people of Great Britain enjoy, and lor its initiation in
Australasia, is due ; so that while Mr. Wentworth is entitled to all the credit that can
be given him for his struggles on behalf of self government, Victoria may very well be
accredited as the propelling power towards the result. To Sir John Pakingtonis due
the recognition of his having taken the matter so successfully in hand, while the
Duke of Newcastle —his successor —accomplished the issue shortly before the time
at which we have arrived. It has been thought necessary to introduce a portion of the
history of New South Wales, since it shows the difficulties that must have
been experienced in obtaining the privileges as free-born citizens which we
now-a-days enjoy. The invitation to consider respectively the subject of
Constitutions suitable to themselves, a report of which was to be forwarded to the
Home Government, caused a great interest to be taken in politics during the years
1853 and 1854 by the colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and
Tasmania. Western Australia was not included in the Government scheme, on
account of its progress not having as yet been very remarkable, while New Zealand
had shortly before received a constitutional measure of such a liberal character as to
answer the requirements of the time, Victoria, in consequence of the gold
discoveries, rapidly became more populous than any of the other colonies, and
it may be surmised that this rapid increase of population was a main factor in causing
the Imperial authorities to give their sanction to the universal demand for responsible
government. Mr. La Trobe, in August, 1853, requested the Legislative Council of
Victoria to accept Sir John Pakington’s invitation. They were aided in the
undertaking, since they had before them the labors of Wentworth’s committees of 1852
and 1853. In September the members of the Council undertook the task of
framing a new Constitution for Victoria, but, on the motion of Mr. Foster, the
Colonial Secretary, the subject was referred to the Select Committee. Harassed as
he was, it could hardly be expected that he would be able to make a very powerful
speech. The cause of his anxiety was that on the 29th August—he spoke on the
Ist September —there was a threatened resistance to the law at Sandhurst.
The Select Committee contained himself, Mr. Stawell, Mr. Childers, the
Speaker, Dr. Palmer, Mr. Haines, Mr. O’Shanassy, Mr. Greeves, Mr. Miller, Mr.
Goodman, Mr. William Nicholson, Mr. Smith, and Dr. Thomson, of The
Constitution they framed for Victoria, and afterwards approved by the Liitish
Parliament, was avowedly based upon that of the United Kingdom.
The members were elected for ten years, one member foi each
province to retire every two years, thus the lowest in the poll could only be
seated for two years. Since it was provided that the Upper House should “never
be dissolved,” experience in legislation would secure experienced men, and the
rotation would give the electors an opportunity of returning new men who might be
better adapted to legislate on any of the changes that had taken place in the country
durin" the period of two years. The electoral qualification also provided that a man
shall have resided a year in the colony. The Act provided that the property qualification


tor a member of the Legislative Assembly be <£2ooo or £2OO a year, and the electoral
qualification was the possession for six months of freehold property worth <£so or £5
a year, of £lO leasehold or premises of that yearly value, of a license of Crown
lands for a year, or ot a salary of £IOO per annum. Those possessing professional
qualifications, upon whom the suffrage for the Council was conferred, were also entitled
to vote tor the Assembly. The Assembly to be dissolved every five years, or oftener
at the discretion ot the Governor, and certain officers of the Government, four at least
of whom should have seats, be deemed “Responsible Ministers.”
They resolved that there should be two Houses, with power to make laws
subject to the assent of the Crown as represented generally by the Governor of the
Colony; the Legislative Council, or Upper House, to consist of thirty-five members,
to be elected by the six provinces, into which for the purpose the colony had
been divided, and the Legislative Assembly, or Lower House, to consist of sixty
members ; members of both Houses to be wholly elective and to possess property
qualifications. Electors of both Houses to possess either property or professional
qualifications. The freehold qualification of an elector for the Council was to be
valued at £IOOO, or to produce an income of £IOO a year. Graduates of universities
in the British dominions, barristers, solicitors, medical practitioners, officiating
ministers ot religion, retired officers of the army and navy, were to have the franchise.
"With lespect to the qualification tor an elector of the Lower House, Wentworth's
provision tor the Sydney Legislative Assembly was £lO household, as already in
force. But the £ icfcorians, taking up the proposition of South Australia with regard
to the Lower House in that colony, which was to reduce the household suffrage to
£5, followed suit, and on the recommendation of the Committee the House agreed to
the reduction to £5. A vote was also given to holders of miners’ rights, a privilege
the Sydney miners did not enjoy, unless they had the legal qualification of electors
other than they, which was a very wise provision. The four colonies adopted the
system of two Legislative Chambers, although that system had not hitherto obtained
amongst them , the mixed elective and nominee Legislature, as will be remembered,
having composed but one Chamber in each colony. In outline the different colonies
agreed, although in details there existed diversities ; viz : New South Wales in the
first years of self-government approved of a nominee Upper House, while Victoria,
although adopting the elective principle for both Houses, based the membership of
the Upper House upon the qualification of £5,000 of real estate. Again, in Sydney
the Upper House had only one limitation placed upon it—that of’originating
appropriation or tax bills—but was granted the power of amending them.
in Victoiia, on the contrary, it was provided that all such Bills “ shall
originate in the Assembly, and may be rejected but not altered by the Council.” The
Assembly atterwaids did not hesitate to state that it was not its intention to give the
power of rejection. The constitution of the Consolidated Fund, the charges thereon,
the review and audit of expenditure included in Wentworth’s Bill, were adopted
Any member of either House accepting a place of profit under the Crown, to vacate
his seat, but to be eligible lor re-election. The requirement of a majority of two


thirds of both Houses to make amendments in the Constitution was adopted by the
Select Committee, but the House afterwards determined on requiring an absolute
majority of the members of each House. After much deliberation and discussion,
the Bill conferring self-government on the colony was, on the 25th March, 1854,
received by Mr. La Trobe, who sent it to England. He sent at the same time a
separate Bill, which gave electoral rights to the licensed gold-diggers. Lord John
Russell gave as his opinion that owing to the late date on which the Bill for the
alteration of the Constitution was received, it was impossible for the Parliament in
1854 to deal with it, and Sir George Grey stated the Bills from New South Wales,
Victoria and South Australia contained provisions which only an Imperial enactment
could sanction. This proved an anxious time for Sir Charles Hotham, as the delay
created serious results. He implored, in vain, the Government to proceed at
once to ratify the propositions of the colony. The demagogues saw their
opportunity, and joined with writers of more volubility than common sense, who urged
that all considerations of the Queen and of the Empire shoukl be disregarded, and that
the new Constitution should be proclaimed unlawfully ! The Legislative Council
addressed themselves to the task. A committee was appointed on October 13, 1854,
to prepare an address, which prayed that Her Majesty would cause, without any loss
of time, the draft of the New Constitution to be laid before Parliament.
Sir Charles Hotham, in this emergency, has been blamed for great hesitancy,
and was very much harassed by Mr. H. S. Chapman, whose utterances partook of the
nature of revolution rather than of law. Before the prorogation he gave notice
that he intended to move, at the next session, an address calling on the Governor
“to give his assent to the Constitution Act in the name of Her Most Gracious
Majesty,” a proposition to which Sir Charles Hotham turned a deaf ear. After
consultation with his law officers, he was advised that “ no legal objections exist to
the adoption of the change recommended in Mr. O’Shanassy’s motion, which was
to the effect that he would move an address, calling upon the Governor to establish
an enlightened system of responsible government.” Sir Charles Hotham accordingly
asked the Colonial Office when they might expect the Constitution, and whether, until
such time as it would arrive, they were agreeable to sanction Mr. O’Shanassy’s
motion ; but inasmuch as the Constitution had been in the main sanctioned by the
Imperial Authorities before the Governor’s despatch arrived, no further trouble was
encountered on this point. The Victorian Bill was slightly altered by the Imperial
Parliament. The provisions to control the reservation and allowance of future
measures were struck out. Enactments touching the civil list were reserved for Her
Majesty’s pleasure. The 4th Clause of the Imperial Act, which enabled the “new
Legislature” in Sydney to deal with the proviso as to majorities requisite to
effect constitutional changes, was very obscurely explained by Lord John
Russell.
That at least a portion of the Ministry should hold seats in the elected
Houses is the most essential factor in responsible government, and is the spirit
of the Constitution of the Australian Colonies. This factor was eliminated, and the


spirit was suppressed in Victoria by the acquisition to power of a psuedo-responsible
Ministry. Certain functionaries in the colony having displayed great hostility
towards Sir Charles Hotham on account of his having exposed the recklessness of
expenditure that had obtained in the past, determined to weaken the authority of
the Governor. Their plan was to postpone the meeting of the elected Houses as long
as possible, so as to render themselves responsible to no one. According to the
provisions ot the Imperial Act, it was necessary to proclaim the Constitution within
a month ol its receipt, but the schedule to it (the amended Colonial Act) named the
period when proclamation should take place as being within three months.
According to each Act, the Constitution was to come into force on the day of
proclamation. Sir Charles Hotham, grasping the whole situation, consulted his law
officers, who decided that proclamation within one month would satisfy all conditions
ol the law. Whereupon the Governor, who had a desire to be advised in all knotty
questions, not out of hesitancy or want of courage, but from a strict adherence to
legal procedure, asked when the Government officers mentioned in the 18th clause
ol the Constitution Act, ol whom “ lour at least ” were to occupy seats in the new
Houses, would assume responsibility, and whether they were responsible to the
existing Council. Some of his advisers evaded a reply by telling Sir Charles
Hotham, “ the words ‘ responsible officers’ occur not in the text, but merely in the
marginal notes to the Bill, and that the word ‘ responsible,’ applied to such officers,
has no definite legal meaning.” It has been contended that to a certain extent the
functionaries named in the (18th) clause—the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General,
Colonial Treasurer, Commissioner ol Public Works, Collector of Customs,
Suiveyoi-General, Solicitor-General—have always been responsible to the existing
Council. Hie Governor felt himself on the horns of dilemma. Lord John Russell’s
despatch of July, 1855, transmitting the Constitution, was received on October 16th,
by the “ Shulimar.” On the 23rd November the Act was proclaimed, and on the
same day the Legislative Council was convened, not, however, without the Governor
having experienced some embarrassment. The Executive Councillors, adhering to
the letter ol the law, informed him, when summoned to consider the estimates on
November 6th, that their responsibility would commence on the 23rd, and that they
had not considered the question of laying any estimates before the Legislature, or how
such estimates should be dealt with.
Those who had schemed to avoid responsibility to the Governor or to the
people were at length compelled to put their plans into operation very hastily. The
Legislative Council met on Friday, 23rd November, when the Governor handed to Mr.
Haines a minute as to how business was to be conducted, under the system by which
others had obtained so much responsibility. No objection was made to the terms of
the minute by Mr. Haines or his friends, but, nevertheless, the shuffling of Mr.
Haines and his party was so manifest that the Governor decided on requesting him
to inloim the Ministers that he felt bound to maintain a neutral position by
disregarding the individual and dealing only with his acts. The Constitution Act
provided that pensions should be granted, when the Act came into operation, to those


officers “ who, on political grounds, may retire or be released ” from office. Those
who were to benefit by this provision were Mr. Haines, Mr. Stawell, Mr. Childers,
and Captain Clarke—Captain Lonsdale, the Treasurer, and Mr. Croke, the Solicitor
General, both of whom were absent, were to be included, and released without being
consulted. Mr. Haines, being unable to explain the money arrangement, but who
being, however, in his own mind quite clear on the point, was bound to protect the
released officers, and consequently Mr. Stawell was sent for. On November 2G Mr.
Stawell waited on the Governor, who was then rapidly declining in health, at his
residence at Toorak. On the Governor asking him what it was that Mr. Haines failed
to explain, Mr. Stawell replied that the Governor was called upon by the Constitution
Act to enforce the power thereby given to him, so that certain officers could be
expelled from their posts. The Governor, after interrogating the Attorney-General—
to whom no one imputed any mercenary motive—as to the legality of such a step,
having received an answer in the affirmative, agreed to act accordingly. The
Attorney-General wrote the letter, which was signed by the Governor, conveying the
information that the proclamation of the new Constitution rendered it necessary to
form a Ministry, and that, therefore, the above-named gentlemen were to consider
themselves “ released on political grounds,” and on the same day Mr. Haines was
invited to submit a list of names for the formation of a Ministry. When the
Council assembled on the following day, the announcement was made that Haines,
Stawell, Childers, and Clarke, had resigned office, and a motion for the adjournment
of the House was put.
On Mr. Fawkner’s motion, the members refused to adjourn until they had
carried an address asking for an explanation with regard to the dismissal or
resignation of some members of the Executive Government, as stated in the House.
Feeling that their plans would be jeopardised if the information for which they asked
revealed the fact that the release of the officers was not an arbitrary act of the
Governor, but a part of the game they were playing, and since even the deadliest
enemies unite their forces when a common danger confronts them, so did the
members bury the hatchet for the time being. On the 28th, the released officers
were all re-appointed to their old posts with little alteration. Mr. Sladen received
the office of Treasurer in room of Captain Lonsdale (released), and Mr. Molesworth
was appointed Solicitor-General instead of Mr. Croke (also released). The new post
of Commissioner of Public Works was given to Captain Pasley, R.E., the Colonial
Engineer. If Sir Charles Hotham could have foreseen what was to happen, he would
have hesitated to commit an act which would place his nominees—one-third of the
House being nominated by the Crown—in the position they now held. Under the
Electoral Bill, which had for its object the enlargement of the House, and entitled
the holders of miners’ rights to vote, elections had taken place, and a few instances
of the minds of the community in the selection of their representatives will convey
to the reader its feelings at that time, Mr. Peter Lalor, who was the leader in the
Ballarat erneute, and Mr. Humffray, the agitator, were among the new members;
while Mr. Grant, the solicitor, who rendered himself notorious in promoting the


meeting to denounce military coercion in Melbourne—after the Ballarat affair —was
elected for Sandhurst. On the 28th, the documents for which the Council asked
were furnished by the Governor, and read by the clerk to an astonished House. I)r.
Greeves, one of the city members, moved resolutions condemning the arrangements
made, and charged the persons directly interested with hood-winking the Governor
into the act of releasing certain functionaries on political grounds, by leading him to
believe that the mere proclamation of the new Constitution Act authorised him to
exercise powers which he could only do after the return of the writs for the first
election, or, at farthest, of the meeting of the Council and Assembly. He condemned
the course of appointing nominees to hold offices tenable only by representative
members, and passed a severe stricture on the terms of the Governor’s minute of
November 23.
It is unnecessary to explain the mode of voting by ballot, or to recount the
numerous advantages the system has conferred upon every country into which
it has been introduced. Suffice it to say that when, in December, 1855, an
Electoral Bill was down for its second reading, Mr. William Nicholson gave notice
of a motion —That in the opinion of this House, any new Electoral Act should
provide for electors recording their votes by secret ballot,” and it is therefore to this
gentleman that the colony is indebted for its introduction. He was very much
respected, and had occupied the Mayoral chair of Melbourne, and, moreover, had
distinguished himself as having taken an active part in legislating against the landing
of “ expiree convicts ”in Victoria. The opinion of the Legislature was taken by Mr.
Nicholson on December 19, 1855. The resolution was strenuously opposed by
Messrs. Childers, Mollison, Smith, Fawkner, O’Shanassy, O’Brien, and Dr. Greeves,
but nevertheless was carried by thirty-three votes to twenty-five, and on the following
day Mr. Haines, having no alternative, announced that the Ministry had tendered
their resignations. The defeated Ministry had made an error in over-rating the
influence of those members who were antagonistic to the measure.
The year 1856 opened somewhat portentously upon the colony, it being
without a Governor and without a Ministry.
On December 21, 1855, the Council adjourned until January 8. On the
former date Mr. Nicholson, owing to his resolution for the Ballot Act being carried,
was sent for by the Governor, and undertook to form a Ministry, consequent on the
resignation on the 20th of the Haines Ministry. Having failed in the
accomplishment of the task, the Acting-Governor, Major-General Macarthur, sent for
Mr. Nicholson on January Ist, and asked him if he might consider himself at liberty
to send for Mr. Haines. The matter being left in the Acting-Governor’s hands, who
administered the government of the colony after the death of Sir Charles Hotham during
nearly the whole of the year 1856, Mr. Haines was requested to form a Government,
with the result that each member of the former Haines Ministry resumed his place.
Major-General Macarthur was a member of the well-known Macarthur family, so long
and so intimately connected with the adjacent colony of New South Wales, and was
the eldest son of Captain Macarthur, the celebrated introducer of the merino sheep,


and the brother of Messrs. William and James Macarthur, of Camden. He was born
at Bath, England, in 1789, and in the following year accompanied his father to New
South Wales. His early days were spent at Parramatta. In 1808, at the age of 18
he entered the army. In 1809 he became Lieutenant, and served with distinction in
the Peninsular War. He was present at the battles of Corunna, Yittoria, the
Pyrenees, Nive, Nivelle, Orthes and Toulouse. He received a war medal and several
clasps for these services. He was with the 39th Regiment in Sicily, Canada, Spain
and France. After his return to England he was for several years in charge of the Lord
High Chamberlain’s department. In 1837 he was on the staff in Ireland. In 1841
he was made Lieutenant-Colonel, and then sent out to these colonies as Deputy
Adjutant-General, In 1854 he was made a Colonel, and in 1855 he succeeded to
the command of the Forces in Australia. In the early part of 1857 he was made a
C.8., and in 1862 a K.C.8., while in the same year he was appointed Colonel of the
100 th Foot. He died in London on January 4th, 1872, at the ripe age of 83 years.
He was married to Sarah, the third daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Neill, and sister
of Brigadier-General Neill, who fell at Lindenow.
A public funeral was accorded the Governor, and attended by an immense
concourse of persons, which included representatives of every grade of society in
Victoria. The awful suddenness of the stroke which at a critical moment deprived
the colony of its Governmental head, and a strong feeling, which, since his death, had
gained ground, namely, that his mental faculties had been overtaxed by the duties
which devolved on him, caused a powerful sentiment of sympathy on all sides for the
deceased. Business was almost entirely suspended throughout the day; the Banks
and the Public Offices, including even the Custom-house and Post-office, were closed
to the Public. After the Service in the Church of England Cathedral (St. James’s),
the coffin, containing the remains of the Governor, was removed by eight of the
seamen of the “ Fantome” to the gun-carriage which was prepared tor its conveyance
to the cemetery. Another serious loss by death was sustained, that of Major-General
Sir Robert Nickle, in the same year, 1855, by the people of Victoria. He passed
away on May 29th, greatly deplored. This officer entered the army in 1798, and
distinguished himself in the Peninsular War. He was afterwards in the States ot
America and Canada as well as in the East and West Indies, and was at the time ot
his death Commander-in-chief in the Australian colonies. The forbearance with
which he acted in dealing with the digging population after the insurrection at
Ballarat rendered him popular in Victoria. After the Council re-assembled, Mr.
Fawkner moved that Major-General Macarthur he requested to cause XTSOO to be
voted to defray the expense of the late Governor’s funeral, and to raise a monument
to his memory. The motion was opposed by Mr. Grant, Mr. Humffray and Dr.
Owens ; but an amendment moved by Grant was lost by 42 votes against 8. Mr.
Nicholson on the same date explained to the House the cause of his inability to form
a Ministry, which he averred was owing to the new Constitution not being in operation;
but that otherwise he would have succeeded. Mr. Haines declined to state his


intentions with regard to the Ballot Act, which Mr. Nicholson requested him to leav<j
an open question. The clauses required to carry out the decision of the House had
been proposed by him, but Mr. Haines and his colleagues hoped to overthrow that
decision. They, however, wavered in making the attempt, as they feared the effect
of what a premature announcement by them to ignore the resolutions of the House
might have on some of their own supporters.
Mr. Goodman’s notice that he would move on January 16th that the adoption
of the ballot by the House was intended to cause the Ministry to declare what
policy they were to adopt in reference to it, had the effect of causing Mr. Haines
to say, had it not been rumoured in some quarters that it was very probable
Mr. Goodman could form a Ministry, he would not be forced to make any
statement. He gave a most unstatesmanlike reply by stating that the former
resolution of the House would, since Mr. Nicholson had failed to form a
Ministry, be considered as non-existent; but, desiring to cling to the sweets of office,
he partly withdrew his statement by adding that the ballot should in future be
considered a non-Ministerial question. Yet, when first introduced, this question had
been made by the Haines Government, and, contrary to Mr. Nicholson’s express
desire, a Ministerial question. Mr. Nicholson succeeded in carrying all his clauses
of the ballot act in committee. He failed at first to see the utility of inserting a
clause, but afterwards approved of it, which placed a check upon tampering with
voting papers or the ballot-box.
Mr. Childers condemned the ballot as wrong and impracticable, and strange to
say, in 1880, in the House of Commons, declared that the ballot was one of the most
important measures introduced and passed by the Liberal party in England. He
contended when a Victorian legislator that under the ballot a separate “ polling place
would be required for every 120 or 160 voters,” but he failed to convince the House that
his assertion was correct. One of the questions which disturbed what should be the
most tranquil assembly of men—the legislators for the country—was that Grant,
Humffray, Owens and others advocated the policy of the local election of a
Governor.
The Mayor refused to preside at the meeting, which he was requisitioned
to convene, but which he could not possibly help convening. Mr. Westgarth,
however, took the chair, but the whole affair ended in a complete fiasco. It
was impossible to decide whether the majority of the 3000 persons present
were in favour of Colonial Home Rule or otherwise, and it was therefore
impossible to pronounce whether the first resolution was carried. An amendment,
demanding a ballot for the Governor’s election, destroyed the game of the
contrivers of the meeting, and the miserable and contemptible attempt to
dictate to the Home authorities was consequently overcome. The originators of the
proposal could not have thought out their plans properly.
The ballot oi secret voting has been employed in political, legislative and
judicial assemblies, and also in the proceedings of private clubs and corporations.


At Athens, the dicasts, in giving their verdict, generally used balls of stone named
psephi, or of metal named sponduli. It is from the latter word we get by some
extraordinary means of intellectual corruption the word “ spondulex,” which is
equivalent in the vulgar tongue to that of money.
As far back as 131 B.C. the ballot was used at Rome, and in Great Britain a
political tract of the time of Charles 11. was written in all probability by John Lilburn,
who was an English secretary and prolific pamphleteer at that period. This man was
the younger son of a gentleman of good family in the county of Durham, and was
born in 1618. His pamphlets, which number over 100, have never been published,
but may be found in the British Museum, London. To return to the subject of the
ballot. It was actually used by the Scots’ Parliament of 1602 in proceeding on the
“ Billeting Act,” a measure proposed by Middleton to secure the ostracism of
Lauderdale and other political opponents who were by secret vote declared incapable
of public office.
The plan adopted was as follows : —Each member of Parliament wrote, in a
disguised hand, on a piece of paper, the names of twelve suspected persons ; the
billets were put in a bag held by the registrar; the bag was then sealed, and
was afterwards opened, and its contents ascertained in the Exchequer Chamber,
where the billets were immediately burned, and the names of the ostracised concealed
on oath.
The Billeting Act was repudiated by the King, and nothing more was heard of
the ballot until 1705, when Fletcher of Saltoun, in his measure for a provincial
government of Scotland by annual Parliaments in the event of Queen Anne’s death,
proposed secret voting as a protection of members from the influence of the Court.
The Benthamites advocated the system in 1817. The famous Dan O’Connell
introduced a bill on the subject in 1830.
Popular opinion being in favour of its employment, it was in 1838 the fourth
point of the People’s Charter. The ballot, according to the report of Lord
Hartington’s Select Committee of 1870, would, if introduced, probably not only
promote tranquility at elections, but protect voters from undue influence, and
introduce greater freedom and purity in voting.
At Manchester and Stafford in 1869, test ballots had taken place on the
Australian principle as practised in Victoria, which proved highly satisfactory. At
Stafford the returning officer stamped each card before giving it to the voter, the die
of the stamp having been finished only on the morning of the election. This course
prevented from being practised what is known in the colonies as “ the Tasmanian
dodge,” by which a corrupt voter gave to the returning officer, or placed in the box,
a blank non-official ticket, and carried out from the booth his official card, which
a corrupt agent then marked for his candidate, and gave, so marked, to corrupt
voter No. 2 (before he entered the booth) on condition that he also would bring out
his official card, and so on ad libitum. By tins means, the agent received a security
for his bribe, unless the corrupt voter chose to disfranchise himself by making


further marks on the card. The ballot is used very largely in the British colonies
and on the Continent, the system employed by the United States being a most
imperfect one, and this seems strange in a country which is universally admired for
its capacity to work all “institutions” in a proper manner.
Greece is the only country in which the ball-ballot is used. The voting takes
place in the churches ; each candidate has a box on which his name is inscribed, one
halt (white) being marked “ Yes, ” the other half (black) “ No.” The voter receives
one ball or leaden bullet tor each candidate from a wooden bowl, which a clerk
carries from box to box. The voter stretches his arm down a funnel, and drops the
ball into the “ Yes ” or “ No” division. Although the vote is secret, there is
apparently no check on “ Yes,” votes being given for all the candidates, and the ball or
bullet is imitable. The history of the ballot in Hungary is remarkable. Before
1848, secret voting was unknown there. The electoral law of that year left the
regulation ol parliamentary elections to the county and town councils, very few of
which adopted the ballot. The mode of voting was perhaps the most primitive
on record. Each candidate had a large box with his name superscribed, and painted
in a distinguishing colour. On entering the room alone the voter received a rod
from four to six feet in length (to prevent concealment of non-official rods on the
voter’s person), which he placed in the box through a slit in the lid. Having given
a short account ot the balloting systems, we must return to our subject, which has to
deal with the mode of introducing a pseudo-responsible government in Victoria.
Those who concocted it, knowing that it was fraught with danger, thought it desirable
that another Governor would sanction similar proceedings. If the Secretary of
State should happen to give an adverse judgment upon an isolated case, it was
probable that if other colonies furnished instances of a similar nature he might
modify his decision. To whom, then, were they to look to assist them in their
designs ? Sir W. Denison, to whom Captain Clarke had been private secretary in
Tasmania, might be approached through that officer, as he was in intimate
correspondence with the Governor, but he was a more sagacious Governor than Sir
Charles Hotham as to the acceptance of the opinion of law advisers, yet it was
nevertheless necessary to consult the chief civil officer of the Government, Mr. Deas
Thomson, a gentleman highly esteemed by all with whom he came in contact.
Captain Clarke had already written to the Governor to describe what he called the
“ Ministerial crisis,” but Sir W. Denison decided to await the arrival of Mr. Deas
Thomson, who went to England in 1854, before the existing form of government
should be modified by him. This action drove consternation into the conspirator’s
camp.
If Deas Thomson could, like Captain Lonsdale, have been released in his
absence, their plan might have succeeded, whereas his presence on the scene would
be fatal to their designs. The Governor, Sir W. Denison, endeavoured to meet their
views by impressing upon Deas Thompson the importance attaching to his acceptance
of office, as his thorough acquaintance with the affairs of the colony and his

capabilities in administration of details would produce a wholesome effect. No
Executive Councillors had been appointed by Sir W. Denison since he was sworn in,
because the universally-expressed desire that Mr. Thomson should form the first
Government was what he arrived at gratifying. Deas Thompson pointed out to the
Governor that any difficulties arising from the want of an Executive Council might
be met, by appointing persons unconnected with party politics (whom he averred
were eligible for such appointment) as members. Consequently Colonel Blomfield
—the officer in command of the troops, and a member of the late Executive Council
—Sir Charles Nicholson, the Speaker, and Messrs. W. Sharpe Macleay and James
Macarthur, of Camden, were appointed. These men were regarded as not being
willing or likely to perpetrate any fraud upon the Constitution, and at once verified
that opinion by stating, when the question of pension for retiring officers was
introduced, that the terms of the Constitution Act could not be interpreted as
recognising the voluntary act asked at the hands of the officers as retiring or being
released officials. The proposed retirement, notwithstanding that the Councillors were
not aware of the method by which Sir Charles Hotham’s letter of release was obtained,
was pronounced irregular. Sir William Denison was of the opinion that there were no
political grounds for an application to retire, and, notwithstanding this view of the
case, called upon Mr. Donaldson to form a Ministry, after Deas Thomson, on January
25, had definitely and officially declined to proceed with the task. The Governor, on
being requested by his Councillors to take the opinions of the judges of the land,
whether the proposed voluntary release of the officers would be in harmony with the
spirit or terms of the words in the Constitution Act, consented to do so. The judges
decided unanimously that the changes made in the Governor’s Commission had no
reference whatever on political grounds to the retirement of the officers named.
Mr. Justice J. N. Dickinson gave as his individual opinion that none of the
officers could by resignation claim the pensions so long as they were allowed to
retain office, whether permitted or not permitted to be members of the Executive
Council. In explanation of their position they cited the case of a Ministry resigning
in the mother country, where “Ministers never in fact throw up their offices or refuse
to do acts devolving upon them as Ministers; they continue invariably to hold office
until successors are found to them.”
The Governor, seeing that this reasoning was so self-evident, had no hesitation
as to the course he should adopt, and, withdrawing his application to Mr. Donaldson
to form a Ministry, appointed Deas Thomson and the Colonial Treasurer as members
of the Executive Council. The government was to be carried on, as the law required,
under the Governor, who was responsible for all measures, until the elections to the
new Assembly should bring about legitimate responsibility through the two Houses.
The Government of New South Wales was carried on by the Governor and his
nominated Executive Council until the elections in 185G, when an administration
was formed.

November 21st, 1856, the following list of members appearing in the Government
Gazette of November 7th. The names deserve to be recorded before closing the

On Mr. Stawell, the leader of the Ministry, having been removed to the Bench
in place of Sir W. v’Beckett, who retired owing to ill health, the Ministry fell to the
ground on March 3rd, 1857. This was the first change of a Ministry in Victoria, and
has a certain amount of interest, since it occurred through the question of immigration.
A vote to facilitate immigration had been taken f0rT270,000, while from after revelations,
according to the Ministry’s intention at the time, and the arrangements they had
made, it appeared that the scheme involved only an expenditure of <£120,000. It is
singular that even up to the present day immigration is a question affecting very
much the minds of a certain section of the colonists, and it is, moreover, one which
should receive the greatest consideration by the legislators in Australia.
The adverse vote on this question, which caused Mr. Haines and his colleagues
to resign, gave them a title to a pension.
Mr. Childers, although not entitled to a pension, received payments for nearly
a quarter-of-a-century, save when he was holding offices of profit in England; and
notwithstanding that his claim was groundless, it was never questioned. There must
have been in those days some rather questionable transactions. Sir Robert Nickle,
although having been enabled to offer rewards for rebels, Captain Clarke was induced
to see that no impropriety existed in appointing some of them to prominent positions.
The morality of politics was also at a very low ebb, since Mr. Childers, when
addressing the electors at Portland, told a person fuller of ignorant curiosity than
intelligence that “ the cash was on the way” for a local work; and even Captain
Clarke attempted to secure the votes of the electors of Emerald Hill by promising
them a cemetery, we presume with the hope that all adverse voters would, before the
next election, be interred therein.
Mr. O’Shanassy, without previous notice, moved a vote of censure and want
of confidence against the Ministry, which was, in a very full house, carried by a
majority of six—the numbers being 23 to 29. The history of its downfall may be
briefly told. One of the first subjects that came under the consideration of the
House was an expected deficit in the revenue, in comparison with the proposed
expenditure, when Mr, Sladen, the Treasurer, made some remarks with reference
to the vote for emigration, which gave rise to the motion. Mr. Brooke called forth a
reply from the Treasurer by desiring to ascertain the idea of the Government as to
the revenue of 1857. The Treasurer had two months previously made a statement
regarding the expected revenue, but Mr. Brooke wished to be satisfied with regard to
the sum of T350,000 expected to be derived from the tenants of the Crown, to which
an unsatisfactory answer was given; but the great point urged against the Treasurer
and the Government was that the latter had taken a vote of the House for emigration


amounting to £270,000, and only intended to appropriate £150,000 to that object,
whilst the remaining £120,000 was to be applied to meet deficiencies in other
branches of the revenue. There was an impression existing at the time amongst the
public that Mr. O’Shanassy, in moving a vote of censure without giving previous
notice, overstepped the bounds of Parliamentary procedure. Be that as it may, Mr.
O’Shanassy was sent for and undertook the responsible task of forming a new
Administration, in which he succeeded. The new Minister, although himself an able
man, was incommoded by what may be termed “ camp sutlers.” Of course it is not to
be expected that in a new country where men of honesty are intent on getting a
living, adventurers who hope to climb into power are not to be found. The new
Government lasted hardly six weeks, and Mr. Haines again became Premier. Owing
to the personal esteem with which he was regarded, and that he had a better following
than his predecessor, he managed to succeed in retaining office longer.
In fact, had it not been owing to something relating to a schedule of an
Electoral Districts Act, his period of office would have lasted much longer than a
year. Mr. O’Shanassy again resumed the reins of government, an event which
brings us down to February, 1858—just 30 years ago.
The course pursued by Victorians from this period was upon democratic lines.
State aid to religion, after being lost by a vote of the Assembly, is still preserved by a
majority of one vote in the Council, and the attempt to come to an amicable
arrangement as to the national and denominational systems of educational boards,
which was that they might be fused into one general and national system, proved at
that time futile, although it was to some extent accomplished later on. Mr. Heales
was the person who may be said to close the democratic race with the
ultra-democratic programme. This programme, as sketched by the Governor, Sir
Henry Darkly, in his opening speech to the Assembly, on August 30, 1801,
referred to that everlasting perplexity—the Crown or Waste Lands—which,
although termed “ waste,” were occupied by squatters. Occupation of any waste
lands by simple license would be permitted by the Government to any person
who intended settling and cultivating, and took 100 acres, on paying 2s. Gd. per acre
of rental.
The second item in the programme was that of Protection. It was to be
adopted, partly with a view of increasing revenue by increasing customs dues. A less
duty was to be levied on colonial than on imported spirits, with a view to encourage
colonial distillation.
The third proposition was that each member of Parliament was to receive a
salary of £3OO a year. It was also suggested that the export on gold, which was 2s.
Gd. per ounce, should be reduced by one shilling ; the introduction of the Torrens
Real Property Land Transfer Act ; and the substitution of an Educational Board for
the then existing two divisions, on the grounds of economy, and of giving a sound
secular education. Abolition of state aid was also advised, and the reform of the
constitution of the Upper House urgently desired.


The Ministry which succeeded that of Mr. Heales—Mr. O’Shanassy’s—lasted
for nearly two years. The first step it took was a Conservative one. The
lands question was that to which it first gave its attention. It is one over
which there were at the time, and still are, at the date of writing, many
heart-burnings.
In addition to the complications of the numerous interests that had arisen under
the systems hitherto in force, there was the difficulty of dealing with the squatters,
who were placed in a rather strange predicament. By the Imperial Act of 1855, the
colonial lands administration was transferred to the colonial Legislature. From that
time till 1860, when Mr. Nicholson was Premier, there were some animated
discussions on the subject, but he settled the matter by succeeding in passing the
Land Sales Act, and thus any further operations of the “ Orders in Council ” were
prevented. After much discussion, and many efforts as well as propositions which
did not prove useless, a comprehensive measure —the Land Law of 1862—was
passed. The history of the contention between squatters and agriculturalists is so
well known as not to be worthy of being repeated. The great object in the contest
was to promote the permanent settlement of the country by giving privileges to that
class known as “ selectors ”or “ cockies. ” The price of land was fixed at 20s. an
acre, but intending residents could select at will over the area surveyed, and facilities
were offered them to make their payments by giving them the option of buying one
half of their section, and leasing the remainder at a yearly rent of 2s. 6d. an acre,
with the understanding that after eight such yearly instalments, the remainder was
also their own. It was determined that the land should be surveyed in sections of
from 40 to 640 acres, and no one was entitled to purchase under these regulations
more than the latter quantity in any one year. The area of the colony’s soil
was in round numbers fifty-five-and-a-half millions of acres. Of this extent,
four-and-a-half-millions had been alienated from the Crown by sale, and half-
a-million acres existed in worked goldfields, while there were about two millions
appropriated to commonage, and thirteen millions in a state of sterility. There were
twenty-five millions which, not suited to agricultural, could be utilised for
pastoral pursuits, while ten-and-a-half million acres were suitable for agriculture.
Crown Lands were then the subject of an intense general interest, which very
reluctantly permits a monopoly. It is but natural that every person should have a
desire to be possessed of a section of his own, and it has been frequently stated that
from the initiation of self-government in the colony, the question was completely
wrong-settled.
A Land Convention—so intense was the feeling on the lands question—was
organized to discuss the matter. This body assembled daily in Melbourne, had
relations with all the colony, and received the general support of the Press, but
when the Universal Suffrage measure had passed, and the resulting Parliament
had assembled, there was no longer standing-room for the Convention,
which consequently expired.


During the year 1856 the progress of Victoria was in most respects peculiarly
satisfactory. The large balance debt against the colony, contracted during the first
year of the gold discoveries, was wiped off, and a considerable balance to the credit of
the colony existed. For the past three years the change that came over the
circumstances of the colony was remarkable. In the year 1854 the imports amounted
to 4117,742,998, and the exports to Ti1,787,926, leaving a balance of imports
amounting to T5,955,772. In 1855 the imports amounted to T12,007,939, and the
exports to T13,493,338, the balance being on the side of exports, which was considerably
increased in the year 1856. The production of gold during the latter year steadily
increased, the value of this metal exported being over twelve millions, with an
advance of four millions over 1854 and of two millions over 1855, Moreover, the
development of resources in other directions was equally satisfactory. Buildings and
machinery, public and private works, added to the national fixed capital, and gave
constant employment to mechanics and laborers of every kind. Large quantities of
land passed into the possession of private owners, and considerable tracts of new
soil were fenced and tilled, thereby rendering Victoria daily less dependent on foreign
countries for agricultural supplies. Only in one direction did our material progress
appear to have received a check—the falling off in the number of sheep, and as a
consequence, a decrease in the production of wool. The numbers of cattle at the
same time increased to such an extent as to compensate, as far as the meat supply
was concerned, for the loss. The material condition of 1857 was satisfactory and
encouraging, although it witnessed a great commercial crisis. The yield of gold
nearly equalled that of the previous year. The shipments of gold during the year
amounted to 114 tons 14 cwt. and 8 lbs., representing a value in specie of upwards
of eleven millions sterling. The total exports for the year amounted to 415,079,512,
against 414,487,843 for the preceding year; and the imports to 417,256,209, against
413,177,184 for 1856.
The year 1856 commenced amid all the confusion of a Ministerial crisis. Sir
Charles Hotham, the Governor, was dying, and Mr, Nicholson was endeavouring to
construct a Ministry to replace Mr. Haines and his colleagues, who had been defeated
on the ballot question.
In the year 1856 a new Governor assumed dominion over a prosperous people,
and the new Constitution, which was only in partial operation a year ago, was
working well. The first purely representative Parliament of Victoria was elected by
ballot, and the Government kept pace with the progress of the colony, truly devoted
to the cause of its advancement. The national wealth was largely augmented, there
was a marked improvement in the means of general comfort, and there was a feeling
of happiness pervading Victorian society.
The first year of actual Parliamentary Government did not realise the
anticipations of the more sanguine of the population, although some important
measures became law. The Parliamentary franchise was placed on a more satisfactory
basis; the management of the gold-fields was improved ; a great system of railway


works was initiated ; and some progress was made towards a solution of the intricate
problem of the land question. The dissatisfaction in some quarters with the scanty
record of legislative measures was made use of as an argument against the
Parliamentary system. But it must be remembered that the system was in the hands
of men unaccustomed to the habits of public life. Victoria had not statesmen
cultivated to that degree of efficiency possessed by those in the mother country, to
whom politics was a science. If there were no great results in Parliamentary
legislation, still the session could not be termed a failure, inasmuch as it afforded the
constituencies the necessary opportunity of judging of the abilities of their statesmen,
the majority of whom were elected solely on the strength of their own professions.
The population was augmented by the sea-board to the net extent of 42,573,
and stood at about 452,000. The year 1858 witnessed another falling off in the yield
of gold similar to that of the previous years, the reduction in both instances being
10£ tons in round numbers. This showed a great need for some change to be
effected in the system of mining, The population was at least 483,000, showing from
1851—a space of seven years —an increase of over 400,000. From the returns
published of the imports and exports of the colony, and if they be taken as a true
test of prosperity, it would appear Victoria was very much in advance ot the other
Australian colonies. Her imports for 1857 were nearly three times as large as those
of New South Wales, while her exports were almost four times as great. The year
was not by any means a fortunate one for the colony of Victoria. There was a want
of rain, short crops, a deficiency in the yield of gold, an exodus from the colony ot
many industrious miners, a large body of unemployed workmen, and an unusual
amount of insolvency. On a comparison of the returns for 1858 with those ot the two
preceding years, it will be seen that the total revenue in 1856 was 42,946,489 ; in
1857, it was 43,175,888 ; in 1858,43,039,791. Assuming the population during these
years to have increased about 150,000, these figures must be considered as a decline
in the revenue, which is the more marked when it is borne in mind that two new taxes
had been imposed during those years. The tax on opium realised 45188, and that
on the assessment on stock 4235,215, making a total of 4240,403. The proceeds ot
the sales of public lands were in 1856, 4792,135; in 1857, 41,048,948; in 1858,
4699,846.
The large amount invested in land in 1857 caused a heavy strain upon the
financial resources, and contributed very greatly to the severe crisis which took place
at the end of that year. The year 1859 showed a marked improvement in the
prosperity of the colony, the returns declaring a considerable increase in revenue on
the past four years.
Having described the history of the political progress of the colony, we shall
now return to the consideration of its commercial history, premising that a brief
retrospect of the commercial progress of Victoria up to the present time may
prove interesting.


The year 1861 was a most remarkable one in the history of Victoria. The
gradual decline of that feverish era of prosperity experienced in the early days of the
gold discovery reached this year an extreme limit. It was a period of profound
depression, felt by every class in the community. Merchants, in the gradual decrease
in the yield of gold, and in the more frugal habits of the people, experienced a loss
in every branch of their business. Owners of property suffered from the general
decline of rents and from the contracted means of living. Employers of labour were
exposed to all the risks arising from the unfixed and vacillating state of the labour
market, while the working classes had to undergo the consequences of diminished
capital and the curtailment of the field of labour, caused by the operation of natural
and arbitrary causes. The universality of the depression tended in a great measure
to neutralise the material damage to the colony, since the depression felt by all classes
ceases to be an individual injury. The causes which led to the depression and even the
decrease in the yield of gold had a wholesome effect, since the population was thereby
compelled to seek other channels of industry.
The political significance of the year was also of striking importance. The
Heales Ministry was in office in the beginning of 1861. Mr. (now Sir George) Yerdon’s
amended schemes of finance were rejected, and, as a result, considerable changes were
made in the personnel of the Ministry.
The amount of coin in circulation cannot be ascertained, but a significant
illustration of the frugality of the people is furnished by the fact that between July
1, 1860, and July 1, 1861, an increase had taken place of 18 2-sths in the number of
depositors in the savings banks, and of 20y per cent, in the amount deposited.
On March 31, 1860, 358,727 acres were under cultivation, and at the same
date in 1861 there were 419,380 acres. The aggregate produce of the earlier date
was about £2,250,000, and of the latter £2, 270,000.
The aggregate amount invested by the public in the purchase of land, in
Government debentures, or in savings banks, the sum expended in clearing land, in
fencing it and bringing it into cultivation, in the erection of houses and stores, in the
planting of orchards, gardens, and vineyards, in the establishment of manufactories,
in the purchase of machinery and imports of various descriptions, as well as of raw
materials, may be computed at ten millions sterling. When it is considered that
these conjectural figures represent the savings for one year of half a million people
practising little self-denial, and spending annually £1, 500,000 on the consumption of
beer, wine, spirits and tobacco, the progress of the colony was not so bad as some of
the pessimists of those days would have us believe.
The last quarter of 1851, from the revenue statistics, gave a most flattering
result. A large increase was manifest on almost every item upon which an increase
is usually considered as indicative of national prosperity, the few items of decrease
being unimportant. The net increase on the ordinary revenue for the quarter was
-£10,711, and on the territorial revenue for the same year £65,298, with another
£4OOO of gold unsold,


CHAPTER XIV.
THE BURKE AND WILLS EXPEDITION.
1 BSO-1 8 61.
LARGE portion of the history of Australia could be made to consist of
accounts of exploration in the interior of the continent, of the hardships
plPip® endured by the explorers, and of the results produced by their discoveries.
In many instances the explorer has been the forerunner of settlement and
civilization. Many, of course, have entered on the career of exploring with a view
to better their condition, many from the love of adventure, and not a few from the pure
desire to learn somewhat of the nature of the country. The Australian colonists are
adventurous, but that spirit of adventure has been in many instances prompted by a
desire to secure tracts of land which would prove remunerative. Now it is not to
this class, although it has proved beneficial to the colonies at large, that we wish to
refer, but to the class which an intelligent curiosity has urged on to reveal the true
nature of the land of their birth or adoption. In this noble class is enrolled a long
list of names. To Oxley’s journey in 1818 is due the discovery that the Macquarie
and other rivers ended in large reedy marshes. There was Leichhardt, who, in
1844, successfully accomplished the journey to Port Essington, through country
unknown at the time to Europeans ; Mr. Roe, the Surveyor-General, and Mr. A. C.
Gregory, made several journeys in Western Australia, up to the year 1848 ; Sir
Thomas Mitchell, who discovered Australia Felix ; the journeys of Major Sturt, and
Hume and Hovell, are already known to the reader ; Kennedy, who met with a
disastrous death near Cape York in 1848; Mr. Austin, an Assistant-Surveyor, in
1854, who led an expedition in Western Australia, when the lad Farmer, belonging
to it, accidentally shot himself, the effects of which proved fatal. One trait of
character connected with this tragedy is deserving of mention. The blacks
accompanying the expedition, although suffering dreadfully from thirst,
magnanimously gave their share of water to the lad during the two days he lived.
Then there was Mr. 11. C. Gregory, who acted as assistant leader in the next
expedition in Western Australia, and of which Baron Yon Mueller was botanist.
Mr. Eyre must not be omitted as one who distinguished himself by excursions to


Lake Torrens, and from Streaky Bay to Mount Arden. Babbage is also one whose
name is connected with explorations in South Australia; while searching for gold,
which he did not succeed in finding, he discovered springs and reservoirs. The names
of Mr. Hack and Major Warburton (H.E.1.C.) Commissioner of Police, are also
identified with South Australian exploration. J. McDonall Stuart was an enthusiast
in exploration. All the foregoing, with Walker, Landsborough, McKinlay, Alfred
Howitt, the Brothers Forrest, Ernest Giles, and many others, are worthy of niches
in the temple of fame as explorers of the territory of Australia. Two of the greatest
Australian explorers were Burke and Wills, of whose expedition the following is an
account.
On the 20th of August, 1860, the Royal Park, Melbourne, presented a scene
of unusual bustle. Long before noon, so great was the enthusiasm and curiosity,
that hundreds of persons flocked thither to get a glimpse of a large and well-equipped
band of men, about to start with the intention of exploring the interior of Australia,
and at the same time of performing the task of crossing the continent from sea to
sea, which ended in a successful but fatal feat, by Burke, Wills, Gray and King.
The expedition may be described as one consisting of heroes who sacrificed their
lives in the interest of civilization, science and commerce. It was natural that an
assemblage, which numbered thousands as the day advanced, would gather to wish
the party, in their hazardous undertaking, success and a safe return.
The expedition was organized under the auspices of the Royal Society of
Victoria, and was fully provided with everything requisite to make the journey as
comfortable as possible. They had twelve months’ supply of stores, which were to
be but slightly trenched upon while within the bounds of civilization, the squatters
on the line of route having considerately undertaken to entertain the party on their
passage. These stores, with the exception of about 15 tons which were to be
conveyed by way of Adelaide and the Murray, occupied six waggons, three of which
belonged to the expedition; and one of these, on being unfastened, could be
converted into a flat-bottomed boat, a contrivance which was useful for crossing anv
streams met with during the expeditionary march. Amongst the provisions was an
edible named “expedition biscuit,” which was made of meat, dried thoroughly and
pulverized, and mixed with an equal quantity of wheat flour. One of these was
considered quite sufficient for a man’s dinner. For the accommodation of invalids,
there was a pannier so constructed as to fit the camel’s back, and each of these
“ships of the desert ” was provided with a waterproof covering lined with flannel,
so that by this means they would be protected when stationary from the injurious
effects of adverse weather, There was a supply for every camel of two sets of shoes,
each made of several folds of leather, and shod with iron, so that the difficulties
attending travelling over stony ground would be considerably reduced. The camels
had also bridles of a peculiar kind, which, it was claimed, would prove no obstacle
to them swimming any rivers that it was found necessary to cross. Each member
of the expedition carried a pocket charcoal filter, by means of which undrinkable


water was rendered harmless. The expedition was provided with a large number of
leather water-bags, and other means to guard against the horrors of thirst.
Breech-loading rifles, revolvers and ammunition were carried by the members for two
obvious reasons —protection in case of assault, and the procuring of food. Signals,
consisting of the rocket, blue light, etc., and the gong, were not omitted to be taken,
since they would prove useful in case of separation or loss of track. A superstitious
person might have prophesied disaster to the expedition through an incident that
happened shortly before a start was made. One of the camels got loose from his
companions and ran among the crowd, hotly pursued by a Sepoy. The horses kicked,
females screamed, and general confusion set in for a time ; but the refractory camel
having been secured, and order having been restored, and the camels having been
loaded, the dashing Irishman, Burke—there have been some famous Irishmen
named Burke—announced that everything was ready for a start.
The Mayor of Melbourne, Dr. Eades, thereupon mounted a waggon, and after
expressing his gratification at seeing so large a number of Victorians assembled to
witness the departure of the exploring expedition, wished the members of it, in the
name of all present and in the name of the colony at large, “ May God speed you.”
He then called for three cheers for Burke, which were given in a ringing manner, and
it is quite probable, when breathing his last, its echo struck his ear. Three cheers
were given for Mr. Landells and the officers, and three cheers for the party itself.
Mr. Burke, who was mounted on a gallant grey charger, acknowledged the
compliment in that fervid manner so natural to his countrymen, and said that no
expedition ever started under more favourable circumstances. He paid a tribute to
the Government and the Exploration Committee for the manner in which everything
had been done, and he concluded by saying that it was now the part of every member
of the expedition to show what each could do. After these observations, which were
greeted with loud acclamations, the caravan, headed by Mr. Landells, filed off to the
north portion of the park to the tune of “ Cheer, boys, cheer.” After filing past, the
expedition then turned, and left the Park by the South gate, taking the road for
Essendon, where they camped on the first night. The Chief Justice, several
members of the Legislature, and a number of ladies witnessed the departure of the
expedition. The following extract from the Argus of August 21, 1860, gives
a graphic description of the scene :—“Near the wooden houses which have afforded
accommodation for the camels for some weeks past, were pitched about a dozen small
tents, composed of stout canvas lined with green baize. These are for the
accommodation of the officers and associates of the expedition, and can be easily
pitched and struck. Near them were larger tents containing stores and equine
appliances. Several four-horse and six-horse waggons were being packed with
material for the expedition. At one part might be observed a couple of ‘ associates
already dressed in their expeditionary undress uniform (scarlet jumper, flannel
trousers, and cabbage-tree Garibaldi) busily engaged in packing; at another, a Sepoy
might be seen occupied in tying together the legs of a sheep. Orders were being


rapidly issued and rapidly executed, and there was, indeed, every indication of the
approach of something of an extraordinary character. But, amidst all the ‘ hurrying
to and fro,’ there was time for cordial greeting and hearty shake of hand, which every
member of the expedition was compelled to undergo from friends who had assembled
to witness his departure.”
When the project of fitting out an expedition was mooted, the public taking it
up, subscribed funds liberally to defray the necessary expenditure; .£3400 was
obtained by private subscriptions, whilst one enterprising citizen of Melbourne, the
late Mr. Ambrose Kyte, gave £IOOO ; and a public grant of £6OOO, supplemented by
an additional sum of £3OOO to purchase camels in India, was obtained. These sums
served to raise a handsome amount. A committee was formed to control the
expenditure and appoint the explorers. The Chief Justice, members of Parliament,
the Surveyor-General, Mr. Ligar, who had emigrated from New Zealand to Victoria,
and several scientific men, including Baron Yon Mueller, the botanist in Mr. A. C.
Gregory’s expedition to the north of Western Australia in 1856, gave guarantee for
efficient management. Gregory, who was considered a capable leader, declined, and
recommended the appointment of Major Warburton, but his proposition was not
heeded. This latter-named gentleman, when sixty years of age, left Adelaide at the
end of 1872, but was unable to set out on his journey until April 1, 1873, for the
purpose of solving the problem as to the nature of the interior, which separated
South Australia from the Western Sea. Eichard O’Hara Burke, who had been an
officer in the army, was selected as the Commander-in-chief. George James Landells,
who had been sent to India to purchase camels, was regarded as indispensable to an
expedition in which these animals were to be employed, and accordingly he was given
the prominent position of second in command.
Mr. Burke was born in Ireland in the year 1821, and therefore was in the
pMme of life when an untimely end overtook him. He had served in the Austrian
Cavalry, and also in the Irish Mounted Constabulary, previous to his arrival in Van
Diemen’s Land in 1853. After he had filled the duties of Acting-Inspector at
Hobart Town, and as Police Magistrate at Beechworth (Victoria), he was granted leave
of absence to go to England, where he hoped to obtain a commission in one of the
regiments about to embark for the seat of war in the Crimea. Failing to secure
what he desired, he returned to Victoria, and was appointed as one of the
superintendents of the Victorian Police Force, a position which he held until selected
as leader of the exploring expedition, a task which fired him with the greatest
enthusiasm, and one that his sanguine temperament led him to believe would have a
successful termination.
William John Wills acted as astronomer and surveyor ; Thomas Beckler was
the medical officer; Ludwig Becker took the duties of artist, naturalist, geological
director, &c.; Charles Ferguson was assigned the position of foreman, and Thomas
McDonough, William Patton, Patrick Langan, Owen Cowen, William Brahe, Robert
Fletcher, John King, Henry Crocker, and John Drakeford were associates. Besides


these there were three Hindoo camel drivers. Some changes having been subsequently
found necessary, several were dismissed. On August ‘2l the expedition camped at
Sandhurst, and on the following day proceeded en route to Swan Hill, which they
reached on September 6. Here they were most hospitably entertained by the leading
inhabitants of the township, prior to their crossing the border of Victoria. Thence
the expedition proceeded to the Darling, which was reached towards the end of the
month. Before they reached Menindie, Landells became insubordinate and resigned,
the doctor following his example. Wills, who was succeeded by Mr. Wright, was
then selected by Mr. Burke as second in command. Wills was born in Devonshire,
England, and was only 27 years of age when he was offered up as a sacrifice to
discovery. He was an earnest student and evinced a great anxiety for the
acquisition of knowledge, even on his way out to Victoria, where he arrived in 1853,
he spent his time most profitably on board ship by acquiring a knowledge of
navigation. His taste for and aptitude in scientific pursuits obtained for him an
appointment in the Survey Department. Having gained a knowledge of astronomy
he was admitted as an assistant in the Observatory. He was bent on exploring, and
has been known to have frequently said that the greatest triumph he could achieve
would be to explore the interior of the Australian continent, and be amongst the
first of those to reach the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria. When, in 1856, it was
proposed to send out an expedition from the river Wannon to Ballarat he was one of
the first to offer his services, but the project fell to the ground. His attainments,
however, qualified him for the important post he, as previously stated, held in the
expedition of which we are writing.
At Laidley Ponds, now named Menindie, Mr. Burke established his first depot,
whence an advanced party of eight under him pushed on to Cooper’s Creek, where
Burke and Wills made several expeditions to learn the nature of the interior.
Owing to the season having been unusually wet and late, there was such an abundance
of grass and water, that they reached that place on November 11th. The party then
travelled slowly down the creek, so as not to fatigue the animals, and also to search
for a suitable spot for the establishment of the permanent depot, which was fixed
upon at camp 65. On December 13th, after having made all necessary arrangements,
and written a despatch to the committee, Burke decided to set forward, without the
remainder of the party under Mr. Wright, whom he engaged at Menindie, and who
had received his instructions to bring on the bulk of the stores. He left the depot
in charge of Brahe, Patton, McDonough, and Dost Mahomed, and left on December
16th for Eyre’s Creek, with Wills, King, and Gray, six camels, one horse, and about
three month’s supply of provisions. In his despatch he writes hopefully of Mr.
Brahe — w ho is described as an educated person —as suitable to take charge of the
party, and says :—“ The feed is very good. There is no danger to be apprehended
from the natives, if they are properly managed, and there is, therefore, nothing to
prevent the party remaining here until our return, or until their provisions run
short.” Brahe, dreading annoyance from the natives, whom he thought might prove
troublesome, in conjunction with his companions, immediately raised a stockade for


protection. No tidings having for four months been heard of those who had gone
forward to the interior, or from those under the charge of Mr. Wright at the Darling,
and scurvy breaking out among his party, Brahe feared fatal consequences and, in
order to avert a disaster, elected to start for the Darling on Sunday, April 21, 1801.
Before leaving, he deposited 501bs. of flour, 501bs. of oatmeal, 501bs. of sugar, and
301bs. of rice, at the foot of a large tree, on which he marked the word “dig.
Seven days afterwards (April 28) he fell in with Wright’s party, which had broken
down, reduced by sickness and death, in attempting to reach Cooper’s Creek, but was
now about to make a retreat to Tarrugutta. Brahe thereupon placed himself and
party under the charge of Wright, who then remained at Bulla till May Ist, when
he commenced the return journey to Tarrugutta. On one occasion, Wills and
McDonough, whom he had taken with him to make an excursion into the interior,
had to walk back to the depot, which was a distance of ninety miles. Wills had been
busily engaged on some astronomical observations, and McDonough, who was
supposed to watch the camels, having neglected to do so, they strayed away, two of
them as far as the settled districts of South Australia. Burke, at length, on December
16th, since there was no sign of Wright’s coming, set out with Wills, King, and Gray,
on his fatal journey. They had one horse and six camels, and by a happy stroke of
fortune, avoided the stony desert, which in 1845 drove Sturt back.
Upon reaching the next camp Koorliatto, he resolved to give the sick a further
spell, while he, in company with Mr. Brahe, advanced to the depot at Cooper’s Creek,
“ for the purpose of ascertaining,” as his despatch of June 20 reads, “ whether Mr.
Burke had returned, or the provisions left there by Mr. Brahe had been discovered
by the natives.” He returned to Koorliatto on May 12 without seeing any signs of
Mr. Burke’s return, or of the hidden stores having been touched. The men at the
camp were all safe but their health was indifferent. Mr. Wright then undertook the
difficult task of conveying the party back to Menindie, the journey being very tedious
owing to the weak state of the men. At length having reached Menindie, he sent on
dispatches with Mr. Brahe who was met at the inn known as the “ Durham Ox,” on
the Loddon, by Mr. Howitt, who was in charge of the contingent party sent forward
from Melbourne with instructions to learn something of the fate of the exploring
expedition. Howitt returned to Sandhurst, in company with Brahe, and sent the
following telegram dated Sandhurst, June 29, to the Hon. John Macadam, M.D.—“ I
met Mr. Brahe at the Loddon with dispatches and received the following message :
Mr. Wright has reached Menindie with eight men, having been joined by Mr. Burke’s
depot party from Cooper’s Creek. Messrs. Becker, Purcell, Stone, and Patton, died
on the journey. Mr. Burke left Cooper’s Creek on the 16th December. Nothing
has been heard of him since that date. He was accompanied by Messrs. Wills,
King, and Gray. The natives proved hostile, and the country for 150 miles was
waterless. Two camels and three horses died, and one was lost.

“ (Signed) A. W. Howitt, Leader of Contingent Party.”


On Saturday, November 2, 1861, news was received in Melbourne that
Mr. Brahe, belonging to Mr. Howitt’s searching expedition, had reached Sandhurst
with a despatch containing the intelligence that Burke and Wills had perished at
Cooper’s Creek in the month of June. The cause of death was exhaustion from
fatigue and want of proper food. The third member of the party (Gray) had died on
the return journey between the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cooper’s Creek, while King,
the fourth member, was found on the Creek living with the natives, who treated him
kindly. He was reported at the time of Mr. Brahe’s setting out for Sandhurst to
have been restored to health. He had the journals ol the leader ot the expedition,
and Mr. Wills’s maps and notes, which show that Burke and his party successfully
accomplished the crossing of the Continent to the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
which was reached by them on February 11, 1861. From the chart kept by
Mr. Wills, we learn that Sturt’s track was followed to its farthest point, in lat. 24.
Finding the country north of this parallel too difficult to traverse, they journeyed
direct east to the 140 th degree of longitude, which they followed north, keeping
almost a straight line, to the Albert River. In latitude 17deg. 53mins. south, they
rested for three days at a place on the river, thereby accomplishing the feat of
crossing the Continent from sea to sea. Turning back, they pursued nearly the
same route, which they travelled for the most part on foot, and were obliged during
the journey to kill their horses and some of their camels for food, as they suffered
greatly from hunger. It is a deplorable incident in the history of this expedition to
relate that they reached Cooper’s Creek on the evening of April 21, the same day as
that on which Brahe, and the depot under his command, set out on the return
journey to Menindie. The provisions deposited by Brahe at the foot of the large
tree were found, but feeling themselves too weak to travel to Menindie, which was
distant about 400 miles, they made two attempts, spending the month of May
in doing so, to reach the South Australian settlements, but were baffled on both
occasions through want of water. The small quantity of provisions left by Brahe
becoming soon exhausted, they were compelled to gather the seeds of the native
plant upon which Lyons and Macpherson had to rely for some time. On such fare,
worn out by the labour of gathering it, and finding themselves helpless, no wonder
is it that some of them should succumb. A strange fatality is attached to this
expedition. Brahe leaves the depot the day Burke and his party arrive there; the
tidings reach Melbourne of the death of four men belonging to the expedition about
the time Mr. Howitt’s party made its start from the city, and about the same time
Burke died while in the act of making a last attempt to get assistance from the
blacks for himself and King; while Wills, alone in his hut, broken down through
disappointment, despair, fatigue and hunger, breathed his last.
Thus ends the history of the two great heroes of Australian exploration ; and yet,
although dead, they live more really in the minds of all reflecting people than if their
earthly tabernacles had not been dissolved. Their monument, the first erected in
Victoria, and for the wretched exigencies of trade, ruthlessly hawked from the corner


of Russell and Collins-streets, where for twenty years it stood, to a miserable
enclosure in Spring-street, speaks eloquently to the contemplative, and arrests the
momentary attention of the most thoughtless. A credit to the land of Australia —
one of them hailing from the land where fear is unknown—lreland, and the other,
from the country where courage and perseverance are eminent qualities—England.
The turmoil of a busy thoroughfare, or the disgustingly incessant clanging of
all car bells cannot detract from the earnest and longing gaze of the two massive figures
which are the work of the late Mr. Charles Summers, a native of Somersetshire,
student of the Royal Academy, London, gold medallist. This gentleman arrived in
the colony in 1853, and, for some time, worked on the renowned quartz mine, Poverty
Reef, Tarnagulla. Being unsuccessful as a gold miner, he returned to Melbourne,
where he resumed his profession. His works consists of busts of all the Governors
of Victoria up to the date of his death, and of the chief founders of the colony, in all
walks of life, politically and socially.
The Burke and Wills Statue is a work of great interest, inasmuch as it was
designed, modelled, and cast in bronze in a Collins-street studio. The casting of this
statue would form a history in itself, owing to the great and universal interest
exhibited in the work by the leading men of the colony. The tin used in it was
obtained from Beechworth, and all the materials employed in its construction were of
local production. The pit from which it was imbedded is still to be seen at 105
Collins-street West. The four has reliefs are historical in the events of the history
of the Burke and Wills Expedition, and contain life-like portraits of many who
are known to the present generation by name only. This work he executed
merely as a work of art, and consequently his remuneration was nothing.
He has also erected a colossal statue of Shakespearian plaster. Mr. Summers left
the colony for Rome and London in 18GG, and worked with increasing energy in his
art till the time of his lamented death which took place in 1878, after he had
completed the four colossal groups of Queen Victoria, the late Prince Consort, and
their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales. Mr. Summers left one
son, who follows the profession of sculptor and has one of the most important studios
in Rome. He will represent the Italian sculptors at the forthcoming Centennial
Exhibition. There are numerous members of the family of the late Mr. Summers in
the colony, his brother being Inspector of Music at State Schools, and examiner for
the musical degree in the Adelaide University, whilst his amiable niece, Miss Hattie
Summers, is married to the Rev. J. B. Sharpe, the respected incumbent of the
Anglican Church at Maffra. We thought it fitting to give a brief outline of Mr.
Summers and his surroundings, since he was so intimately identified with our two
heroes.
The last public honours which could be paid to the memory of these brave
but unfortunate men were discharged on Friday, April 21, 18G3. Although their
remains were removed from the far-distant interior, which was the scene alike of
their sufferings, their death, and their greatest achievements, and were buried with


solemnity and profound expressions of sorrow for their untimely late, yet the
recollection of their noble deeds have not been interred with their bones. The
recognition of their undaunted courage, and the heroism with which they faced
death in one of its most terrible forms while in the pursuit of a great and noble
enterprise, was deservedly acknowledged and perpetuated by the erection of their
monument. The Legislature, at the end of 1863, voted T4,000 for the erection of a
public statue of the lamented explorers. The execution of the statue was, as we
have already stated, entrusted to Mr. Charles Summers, who, from December 1863,
until the date of unveiling, gave the work his constant care and attention. That
date was the fourth anniversary of the return of Burke and Wills from the Gulf of
Carpentaria to Cooper’s Creek, and it was therefore appropriate to select it for the
inauguration of the statue of the two heroic men whose death is, no doubt, in a
great measure to be attributed to the circumstances of the depot party left by Burke
at Cooper’s Creek having gone away a few hours before his arrival.
Long before the time appointed for uncovering the statue —four o’clock-
people had begun to assemble in the vicinity, anxious to secure a position which
would command a view of the ceremony. Mr. John King, the sole survivor of the
exploring party, attended to witness the uncovering of the statue of his companions.
The statue having been unveiled and a salvo of artillery fired, which was followed by
the Headquarters’ Band playing Meyerbeer’s “Coronation March,” His Excellency
stepped in front of the platform, and called for three cheers in honour of the
occasion.
His Excellency then delivered an address, of which the following extracts
have been taken from the Argus “Ladies and Gentlemen—lnhabitants of
Victoria,—l need not tell you that the sounds which are still reverberating are the
echoes of what may well be termed a national honour rendered to the memory of the
illustrious dead * * * * * It will suffice to say that a year had nearly passed
away when the fact was ascertained beyond a doubt that the victory had indeed been
nobly won, but that the leaders in the exhausting struggle had almost fallen in the
hour of triumph, of which this is the fourth anniversary. Burke and Wills
returned from the Carpentaria!! shore to the depot from Cooper’s Creek, or the
Barcoo River, from which they had departed on the previous 10th of December,
accompanied only by John King, who, I rejoice, is present here to-day, to hear from
my lips, the assurance that we offer that full share of the honour we are rendering to
his lamented chiefs, which is due to his distinguished courage and fidelity. He may
well take for his motto now, and for his epitaph hereafter, these words, among the
latest written by the hand of Burke, “ King has behaved nobly.” They buried there,
as you know, the brief but explicit record of their great achievement, “ We have
discovered,” runs the paper left by Burke, “ a piacticable loute to Caipentana,
the chief position of which lies in the 140 th degree of east longtitude.” Then
commenced those disastrous wanderings, the story of which, and of their subsequent


suffering and death, lias now been told by many a pen. But by none has it been
touched upon more eloquently than by my distinguished predecessor in the
Government of the colony. “So fell,” writes Sir H. Barkly in his official report to
the Duke of Newcastle, “ two as gallant spirits as ever sacrificed life lor the extension
of science, or the cause of mankind. Both were in their prime ; both resigned
comfort and competency to embark in an enterprise by which they hoped to render
their names glorious ; both died without a murmur, evincing their loyalty and
devotion to their country to the last.”
And in the manner of their deaths it seems to me that the distinguishing
characteristics of each were strikingly illustrated. The calm and philosophic Wills
begins his last letter to his father in these words :—“ These are probably the last
lines you will ever get from me; we are on the point of starvation, not so much
from the want of food as from the want of nutriment in what we can get.” And he
concludes it with the tranquilly expressed opinion and assurance—“ I think to live
about four or five days; my spirits are excellent.” Two days later, probably but a
few hours before his solitary death, the last words which he recorded in his journal
are literally a scientific dissertation upon the innutritions nature of the food —the
nardoo—by means of which they had for some time protracted their existence.
“ Place,” said the expiring Burke, instinctively recurring to his early military
days, and as I doubt not, with the picture of a fallen warrior upon the battlefield
vivid in his imagination—with a dying thought, too, for the gallant brotherhood of
which he was a member —“ Place my weapon in my hand, and leave me unburied as
I lie.”
Such was the fate of the men whom this day we mourn and honour. *
* For, oft as it shall be told, and oft times it will be told upon this
very spot, Australian parents, pointing to that commanding figure, shall bid their
young and aspiring sons to hold in admiration the ardent and energetic spirit, the
bold self-reliance, the many chivalrous qualities, which combine to constitute the
manly nature of O’Hara Burke. While gazing on that more lowly and retiring form,
they may well teach them to emulate the thirst for science, the deep love of the
Almighty’s works in nature, the warm filial and family affections, the devotion to
duty, self-control, and submission of his own judgment to authority, which he
regarded as rightfully conferred and exercised, and which, if I have read the history
of his brief career aright, pre-eminently marked the character and conduct of William
Wills. “ It,” (the statue) shall serve to unite also in honour the names and
effigies —“ the very form and semblance” of these now celebrated men, whose great
exploit has shed such lustre upon the records of exploration and discovery in this our
age, and engrafted so large a share of interest and glory upon the earlier annals of
Victoria.
Their mortal remains were conveyed to their last resting-place on January 21,
1863. With,ah honour the people of Victoria (numbering on the occasion over

40,000) interred their first heroes; the inscriptions on the coffins being simply as
follows:
ROBERT O’HARA BURKE,
Died 30th June, 18(51,
Aged 40.
WILLIAM JOHN WILLS,
Died 30th June, 1801,
Aged 27.
The dates were fixed by King, though an uncertainty existed in his mind as
to the exact time of Wills’s death. The procession moved from the Hall of the
Royal Society shortly after one o’clock, but owing to the slow rate at which its
length, and the concourse in the streets compelled it to progress, the cemetery was
not reached until about four o’clock. The assemblage of spectators was immense ;
the demonstration in this respect never having been equalled in the colony. The
funeral car was the object upon which all eyes were turned. It was constructed upon
the model of the one used in the funeral procession of the Duke of Wellington. The
wheels, four in number, were bronzed, and in the space between them, the
panelling of the car descended in graceful curves and pillars nearly to the ground.
This lower part of the body was appropriately ornamented, the upper portion being
divided into four panels. On that, on the right, was inscribed in gilt letters Burke’s
initials, “R. O’H. B.; ” and on that, on the left, the initials of Wills, “W. J. W.”
The front panel bore the royal arms, and the back one the inscription “ Carpentaria.”
This car was drawn by six black horses, suitably caparisoned. Having arrived at
the cemetery, and after the conclusion of the beautiful burial service of the Church of
England, the firing party fired the customary three volleys, which concluded the
ceremony, and with it the last chapter of the mournful history of the Victorian
Exploring Expedition.


CHAPTER XV.
I NT EROAMERAL TROUBEES.
1863-186 6.
4f|gN the ordinary sequence of events we thought it right to give prominence to
*w|i II the expedition, but must now return to the consideration of politics.
The cause of the mishap which led to the resignation of the O’Shanassy
Ministry was occasioned in discussing amendments to the New Land Act. The dues
levied on the squatters were, according to the promise given to the Assembly by the
Government, to yield an increased income, which was to be effected by adopting a
system of arbitration for ascertaining the capability of the runs for pastoral purposes,
instead of the method hitherto in force —sworn returns from the several squatters. A
less revenue proved to be the result, owing no doubt to the costliness of arbitration.
This placed the Ministry in such an awkward position that they preferred the old to
the new method, but this course was opposed on the ground that those squatters
whose arbitration cases proved to be of a lesser amount than anticipated had been
unfairly dealt with. The new system being law for the time, it is not to be wondered
at that the squatters who had gained the advantage declared their unwillingness to
abandon it, and their claims having been recognised as just, an opposition was
formed, headed by Mr. M‘Culloch, who, when Mr. O’Shanassy had decided to resign
over the question, was called upon by the Governor to form a ministry. These
occurrences bring us up to 1868. The M‘Culloch Government was well supported,
and with the growth of the colony, socially, intellectually, and politically, presented
a remarkably good personnel. Only one of its members, Mr. Michie, met with
opposition in the new elections. One of the first measures of the new ministry was
the amendment of the Electoral Act passed by their predecessors. In that Act the
secrecy of the ballot had been somewhat impaired by a clause which provided that
the returning officer should affix the voter’s number to his voting paper upon taking
the vote. Improvements in the method of assisted immigration were also to receive
consideration. Further encouragement to intending resident agricultural proprietors
was to be given, and improvements were to be insisted on as the condition of the


purchaser receiving the Crown grant. There was to be a reduction to purchasers
from 10s. to ss. per acre, the residue of the price of 20s. per acre being payable by
yearly instalments of 2s. (3d. an acre. By this system the purchaser would become
possessed of the land in seven years, but on the other hand he could, by paying in
full for one-fourth of the section, lease the remainder for eight years at 2s. 6d. per
acre of yearly rent, after which the leased land also becomes his own.
Ireland is not the only country where the land question has led to disturbance,
for in Victoria it culminated in a riot in Melbourne on August 28th, 1860.
Riots in the early days of the colony were not at all infrequent, as we have
already seen. The one to which we are now alluding was caused by an immense
assemblage coming together on the above-mentioned date, and making a violent
demonstration in the vicinity of the Parliamentary Buildings in favour of a more
liberal Land Act. Mr. Matthew Arnold’s famous description of doing as one likes in
his “ Anarchy and Culture” was exquisitely carried out, for the crowd broke windows,
threw stones at (of course) the police, and wound up by attempting to rush, like so
many mad bulls, into the Assembly where the members were discussing business.
Law, however, reigned supreme, for the Riot Act having been read, the ardour of these
reformers immediately cooled.
Public feeling was greatly aroused over this event, and was emphasised by
sixteen hundred of the citizens on the following day enrolling themselves as a special
defensive force. Shortly before this demonstration of mob law, all the available
military force of the colony had been despatched to aid the New Zealand Government
in the war with the Maories. A number of the rioters were arrested, but owing to
the difficulty of proving distinct charges against them, and their cowardly excuses,
the bench could only deal leniently with them. However, to check any further
public performances of this description, an Act was immediately passed, prohibiting
for the future any public meetings or gatherings within a certain distance of the
Parliament Buildings. A word on the Education Act of 1862 before closing this
portion of the history may be, with advantage, given. There has always been, and
there will always be, a conflict between the secular and religious portions of a
community. It is impossible to expect anything else, and if one question more than
any other has excited animosity, it is that of the denominational versus the secular
system. The denominational system took root very extensively in Australia before
the introduction of representative institutions, chiefly through the action of the
Anglican and Roman communions. The colonial national system, which was formed
on the basis of the Irish National School system, was introduced into Victoria in
1851, when the colony, as it will be remembered, had been separated from New South
Wales. For some time this system took a leading place, but, nevertheless, the
denominational had the most influential class to support it, and eventually an
amalgamation of both systems was effected. The Legislative Assembly, which
is supposed to represent the views of the colonial public as distinctly as a mirror
exposes to a man his image, passed by a majority of 35 to 23 votes Mr. Hcales’ motion


in favour of a national system of education under State aid, and rejected Mr.
O’Shanassy’s motion, which advocated denominational education, by 20 to 21 votes.
By this Act the two Boards were abolished, and one general and national system
introduced, under the control of one Board. Many previous plans and efforts had
failed owing to denominational opposition. The new system was introduced
with very little disturbance. The Board was constituted mainly of members
denominationally inclined, and its first chairman, Mr. Griffiths, was a decided
denominationalist. The appointments were made by the O’Shanassy Ministry,
which could not be expected in the nature of things to act otherwise. But
when Mr. Griffiths died in the following year, the McCulloch Ministry
conferred the vacant chair on one of diametrically opposite views, Sir
J. F. Palmer. The relative position between the national and denominational
system in the colony prior to the passing of the Act was, for the year 1861, a total
of 13,869 national pupils, and 37,476 denominational pupils. The Government
grant in that year to the national system was <£24,907, and to its rival, .£80,827 ;
while private payments for the same year amounted to £56,183. The
expenditure at the present time (1888) on State School Education in Victoria
amounts on a rough estimate to £540,000. Where the two Boards were in operation
in 1862, the number of scholars and amount of State aid during that year was as
follows : —Denominational, 18,584, for whom the State granted the sum of £32,370;
national, 13,446, and aid, £30,936. Under the denominational system, therefore, it
would appear that the cost of educating a pupil was less than that of the national.
As some discussion has beeen carried on lately regarding the salaries of Governors in
the colony, it might he well to state that Sir Charles Ralph Darling —the nephew of
a former Governor of New South Wales —who arrived on 9th September, 1863, to
administer the affairs of the colony, was called upon to entertain an Act of the Colonial
Parliament by which the salary of his office was to he reduced by £SOOO. The large
amount of £15,000 had been agreed to eight years before, in consideration of the
excessive costliness of everything in Melbourne, but when the expense of living
became hardly more than one-third of what it had been in the past, a reduction was
decided on. Some disagreement through this step was occasioned between the home
authorities and the colony in the preceding year (1862), the Act not having been
ratified at home. It had been first proposed by the Colonial Parliament to reduce
the Governor’s salary to £7OOO a year, but the Imperial Government took
strong exception to this proceeding. After some time it was proposed that for
the future the salary was to be £IO,OOO, with a Government House provided and kept
in repair at the colony’s expense, a measure which Sir Charles Darling reserved for
Imperial approval. The earliest of the authorities of the colony of Victoria, the
Superintendent, in 1839, received a salary of £BOO a year. When Port Phillip was
erected into a district in 1843, the salary was raised to £ISOO, and when it became a
colony in 1851, the sum paid to the Governor was £2500. It then increased to
£15,000, and was reduced to £IO,OOO. Ministers also experienced a reactionary
movement in their salaries.


The McCulloch Government had not up to this date projected any public
measures beyond the promised amendment of the Land Law of 1862, and a re-
arrangement of the immigration laws. It was provided by the latter, that through
the pecuniary aid of the State, there should be a majority of female immigrants over
those of males, and also that all State-assisted immigrants, whether male or
female, as far as possible, should consist of those who had had a previous training
which would in some way enable them to be fitted for the requirements of a new
country. The funds, which according to the understanding arrived at between the
colony and the Home Government, to be appropriated for the purpose, were to be one
half of the proceeds of the land sales. As the sales of the public lands had been
nearly suspended until some amendment of the Land Law was effected, a very small
sum of money could only be voted for that purpose.
We shall now review an event in connection with the “ Constitutional party, ”
as the Council’s friends were styled, which sent petitions to the Queen. Sir Charles
Darling, in forwarding one of them, deprecated it as not representing the opinion of
the colonists, inasmuch as he said it had been signed by somewhat less than a tenth
of the adult male population, and that the “ alarm and insecurity ” expressed was not
shared by the “ majority of the petitioners themselves.” How Sir Charles could
have possibly allowed himself to be led into the theory concerning the remission and
levy of duties at the Custom-house, in defiance of a judgment of the Supreme Court,
was at the time matter of much surprise. To the Secretary of State he wrote, in
November, 1865, that under the Act demanding an enforcement against the
Crown, the Government might have been compelled “to disburse by
process of law every shilling they had contracted by means of loans. ” The
Appropriation Bill was sent to the Council on November 15th, and on the following
day was rejected by a majority of 19 votes to 5. The Bill had, amongst many defects,
the glaring one of subverting the tariff without an appeal to the country. After
much factious discussion over the matter, the Governor consented to his advisers
stating any grounds as their reason for a dissolution. The Council sent him an
address, reminding him that no Appropriation Bill had been transmitted to them as
a separate measure; that they were willing to pass such a measure; and that a
prorogation under the existing state of affairs might lead to disastrous results.
Parliament was prorogued on the day (November 28) on which the address was
adopted. Much bickering ensued over this question, and a good deal of
unparliamentary conduct was practised. The elections were held early in 1866.
The land policy and the protection theory obtained large support for the Ministry in
rural electorates, while at the goldfields they were remarkably popular on account of
the proposed abolition of the gold export duty. The new Parliament was met by the
Ministry in February, and Sir Francis Murphy re-elected Speaker by 52 votes against
18. The remainder of the history of this affair will be best told in a brief account
of Sir Charles Darling, who was the sixth Governor of Victoria.


The circumstances which led to his recall are traceable to the lact that at the
general elections which took place in the early part of the year 1865, a large majority
of the members of the Legislative Assembly were returned to Parliament pledged to
carry out a “ Revision of Tariff,” which meant a re-arrangement of the duties or
moneys collected through the Customs Department. The Assembly passed the Bill
brought forward for the purpose, but the members of the Upper House were strongly
opposed to the measure, and in order to save the Tariff Bill the Government
incorporated it with the Appropriation Bill—a measure which the Council refused to
pass, with the result that there was what is known in Parliamentary language as a
“ dead-lock.” Neither House would give way, as each —a usual occurrence in the
case of a quarrel —considered itself in the right. Outside of Parliament matters began
to assume a serious aspect, as money for public payments was not available. The
determination of each House to fight the matter out caused the public to suffer. At
length the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution requesting the Governor to interfere
by recommending him to advise that Treasury moneys be made available for payment
of debts due by the State, while the Appropriation Bill lay in its dormant state in the
Upper House. -Acting on the counsel of his responsible advisers, the members of
the Government, he consulted the banks, and one of them, the London Chartered
Bank of Australia, agreed to grant loans on the security of the Governor’s warrant.
These loans only granted partial relief, and no sign of an Appropriation Bill
becoming law, the Governor dissolved Parliament for the purpose of obtaining the
opinion of the country at large on the vexed state of affairs. The result of the appeal
was that the position of the Assembly was strengthened. Again the Government
tried to get the Upper House to pass the Tariff, but failing, they resigned the reins of
government.
The Governor having invited several gentlemen to form a Government, a task
which none of them would complete, the old Government had to resume office. Finally
the two Houses agreed to confer together, and on April 12th, 1866, an agreement was
arrived at, that if the Assembly struck out the clause limiting the new Tariff to three
years’ duration, and also the word “ resolve,” substituting the word “ vote,” the
Upper House would pass the Bill. As soon as the two Houses sat again the Tariff
was passed, and on the same night the much-needed Appropriation Bill received
Legislative sanction. Matters it was thought had now settled into their normal state,
when news of Sir Charles Darling’s recall reached the colony by the English mail.
Public meetings were held all over Victoria, complaining of the injustice done to
the Governor, and a petition was forwarded to Her Majesty the Queen, breathing
similar sentiments. Sir Charles left Melbourne for England on May 7, 1866.
The history of the affair may be related here. By the time Sir Charles
Darling reached England, a change of Government had taken place there, and the
new party in power refused to review the act of their predecessors. On learning this,
the Victorian Government, backed up by their supporters in the Assembly, passed a
Bill voting the sum of T20,000 as compensation to the recalled Governor. As


w
before, the Upper House was opposed to the Bill, and again the Appropriation
Bill was rejected—this time because it had the “Darling grant” in it. A second
“dead-lock” ensued, and as on the previous occasion, the public were the sufferers.
After a considerable time the British Government re-instated Sir Charles Darling on
the Governors’ List, and he wrote to Victoria stating that he had rejoined the
service, and could not therefore accept money from the colony. Thus ended the
famous second “ dead-lock.” Sir Charles died shortly after the affair, and it is
generally believed that the trouble and anxiety connected with it tended to shorten
his days. At his death a Bill was passed through both Houses, granting a yearly
pension of TIOOO to his widow, Lady Darling, for life. The Government in office
during the whole of these troublous times consisted of Sir James McCulloch,
Premier; Judge Higinbotham, Attorney-General; Sir George Yerdon, Treasurer;
Sir Archibald Michie, Minister of Justice ; the Hon. J. G. Francis, Customs ; the
Hon. J. M. Grant, Lands ; the Hon. M. Hervey, Public Works; and the Hon. J. F.
Sullivan, Mines.


CHAPTER XVI.
RAPID PROGRESS OF THE COLONY.
1867-1880.
year 18G7 was one of political turmoil and social festivity. Parliament
mm f° r eight months, and terminated its deliberations without passing an
Appropriation Act. The actual results of the third session were singularly
unimportant. A Public Health Bill, which had for its object the amendment of the
laws affecting lunatics ; a bill to establish a Royal Mint in Victoria; a measure for
the imposition of a tax on corn, and of ad valorem duties upon numerous articles of
import, together with a dozen bills of minor importance, constituted the practical
work of the session. Two Intercolonial Conferences were held in the year 1867 —the
first on the subject of the Customs duties levied by the New South Wales Government
on certain commodities imported into the Riverina district of that colony from
Victoria, and the second relating to postal communications with Europe. The postal
conference was held in March, and it was agreed that three routes should be
subsidised —Suez, Panama and Torres Straits; the two latter being altogether useless
to Victoria. The total cost was estimated at T400,000, of which Victoria was required
to contribute one-eighth, and the mother-country was to be invited to furnish one-half,
while Sydney was to be the terminus of the three lines. This latter condition raised
a storm of indignation throughout Victoria, the Imperial Government refusing to
furnish the amount asked for. The internal affairs of the colony were fairly good,
and the agricultural returns showed an increase of 85,000 acres over the breadth of
land under crop at a corresponding date in 1866. The vine was in course of rapid
cultivation, and on December 30th the first company to ship fresh meat to Europe
was formed. In this year the Duke of Edinburgh visited Victoria, and had an
opportunity of witnessing the loyalty of those who feel proud to belong to the
colony which bears his illustrious mother’s name.
Those appointed to form the commission on the subject of the payment of
members were as follows :—Mr. Duffy (chairman), Mr. Casey, Mr. G. V. Smith, Mr.
MacGregor, Mr. MacMahon, Mr. Kerferd, Mr. Edward Cope, Mr. Everard, Mr.
Longmore, Mr. Macpherson, Mr. Angus Mackay, and Mr. Wrixon.


With a view to decrease the expenses in connection with the public service,
the Government decided that on January 1, 1869, a reduction of civil servants
should take place. The politics ol the year were marked by an overthrow of the
McCulloch Government. There was a scarcity of labor at this time in Victoria,
although the neighbouring colonies contributed some supplies, and by many
immigration was largely advocated. The facilitation of internal traffic was also
pointed out as a necessity, and in connection therewith the construction of the North
Eastern railway requested. The year 1870 found Victoria rich in all the elements
of prosperity. An abundant harvest had been gathered, and provisions were cheap.
There was some slight grumbling amongst the agriculturists and vignerons, as they
feared that prices, owing to the large yields, would fall below the remunerative point.
Pastoral prospects were also much improved. A succession of dry seasons had
ruined the industry and deteriorated the pastoral tenant’s stock, and then there was
in addition a considerable fall in the price of wool. Besides all this, his term of
occupation had come to an end, and it became difficult for him to obtain the
pecuniary accommodation which would enable him to carry on his business. All
those difficulties had now well-nigh been removed. The establishment of the meat
preserving industry, and the price of wool having gone up to nearly its old figure,
placed him on his feet again. The new Land Act helped the squatter considerably,
since by its means he obtained such an extension of tenure as to place him on easy
terms with his banker.
The year 1870 witnessed one change of Government, and was an exceptional
one in the history of the colony, politically, commercially and socially. At the
commencement the Macpherson Ministry was in office. This Government succeeded
the McCulloch Administration owing to an adverse vote on the question of appointing
to the office of Commissioner of Trade and Customs Mr. Geo. Eolfe, a gentleman
who did not occupy a seat in Parliament. The Macpherson Ministry held office until
the end of March, when it was defeated by the McCulloch Ministry. It was owing
rather to its own inherent weakness that the Macpherson Ministry fell, than to the
Assembly refusing to accept its budget. There was no bond of union amongst its
members, owing to a want of unison in their political views. They might have
appealed to the country, but having declined to do so, the reins of Government were
once more entrusted to Sir Janies (then Mr.) McCulloch. As a burned child dreads
the fire, so did Sir James avoid associating with himself those ultra members who
were regarded to have been an objectionable feature in his former Ministry, and
consequently Messrs. Michie, Wrixon, Mackay and Macpherson were their successors,
the chief of the Administration which had just resigned accepting under Sir James
McCulloch the office of President of the Board of Land and Works, a proceeding
which, of course, caused Mr. Macpherson to be subjected to some harsh criticism,
but it was generally believed that he had not betrayed his former colleagues. The
famous saying of Cicero, that “ a change of mind is not inconsistency,” might,
according to Mr. Macpherson’s friends, be aptly applied in his case. With the
exception of the Census Act, the Annuity to Lady Darling Act —reference to which


has already been made—and the Act for the Prevention of Scab in Sheep, all the
measures passed rendered the first session of 1870 singularly unimportant to the
colony. Prior, however, to that session being closed, it was resolved that a second
session should be held during 1870, with a view to having supplies voted for the first
six months of 1871.
The second session of Parliament for 1870, or what was really the fourth
session of the sixth Parliament of Victoria, was convened on October 27, and
prorogued on December 29. Supplies were granted for the first six months of 1871,
and it was determined that for the future the financial year should commence on
July 1 instead of on January 1, the latter being considered a most awkward date.
Besides passing the estimates, a large amount of legislature had been effected in
that short session of two months, conspicuous among them being the new
Insolvency Act, and the Wines, Beer, and Spirits Sale Statute Amendment Act,
and a Married Woman’s Property Act; a Military and Naval Forces Discipline
Act, enabling us to take more effectual steps for our own defence ; an Act providing
for the collection of duties in the estates of deceased persons, and that which
had been introduced previously—the payment of members of Parliament —also
became law. The financial condition of the colony occupied during the year a great
deal of attention, since the Treasurer made, instead of what is usually the case—one
statement —three statements. Mr. Graham Berry made the first on March 8,
which was the cause of the downfall of the Government; then Mr. Francis
made statements on May 17 and November 15. On March 8, Mr. Berry
estimated that he would have for the year a total revenue of £3,759,918,
and calculated to raise the sum of <£8,529,100. He proposed to spend
£3,750,852, carrying over a balance of £9006 to the credit of 1871. These estimates
were pronounced exorbitant by all parties in the House, and on Mr. Berry declining
to recast them, an amendment, to the effect “that as the Government financial
scheme for the year failed to secure the approval of the House, the estimates of
revenue and expenditure being admitted to be excessive, the longer continuance of
Ministers in office is inconsistent with responsible government,” was carried.
Consequent upon this the McCulloch Administration came into power, and Mr.
Francis made his financial statement on May 17th. He estimated the total income for
the year at £208,324 less than that made by his predecessor, and the expenditure at
£3,459,528, or £291,324 less than Mr. Berry proposed to spend. Owing to the
revenue not having come up to the expectations of Mr. Francis, when introducing,
on November sth, the estimates for the first six months of 1871, he was compelled
to modify considerably his first estimates. During the year 1871, a conference of
delegates, representing New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and
Victoria, was held in Melbourne, but nothing really remarkable to mention came
of its deliberations.
As was the case at the end of 1870, another change in the Government needs
to be recorded. During 1870, the Macpherson Administration had to retire in favour
of another Ministry, with Sir James McCulloch as its head. Sir James, in his turn,


was deposed, and Mr. Duffy assumed the reins of government. Many circumstances
led to this change of government, which are difficult to trace, hut what is alleged to be
the real cause of his defeat was the attempt—the first that had ever been made in the
colony—to meet a deficiency by direct taxation. It was proposed to raise £120,000
by the imposition of 6d. in the £ upon the rateable value of all property valued at
over £25 a year, with the result that the McCulloch Administration was defeated by
a majority of 18 to 24. Perhaps the most incongruous Ministry ever found in Victoria
was that which Mr. Duffy selected. Although it was expected that the session which
commenced in May and ended on November 23rd would have been productive of
valuable results, yet the short session of 1870, commencing in October and ending
in December, proved to be more fruitful in Legislative measures. Two measures of
great importance were, however, passed —the Railway Construction Act and the
Mining Companies’ Act.
The import trade of the year and the commercial intercourse with the
neighboring colonies was of a very satisfactory character, while under the free
provisions of the Land Act of 18C9, settlement rapidly increased. During the year,
9198 applications were received under the free selection clause of the new act, and of
these 6136, covering an area of 609,731 acres, were granted. In every other respect
the colony showed signs of reaching that prosperity which the Centennial year of
Australia is witnessing. The census taken on April 1, 1871, showed a population
numbering 729,654, of whom 400,252 were males and the balance females. Towards
the end of the year many persons were out of work, but the Government voted
£IO,OOO for the purpose of giving those who were unemployed work in the
improvement of valuable Crown land in the neighborhood of Melbourne and Geelong,
by filling up large excavations which had been made for quarrying and other
purposes. In the receipts of the Victorian Railways there was an increase of about
£43,000 for the year, which, owing to its largeness, may be traced to the fact that
the heavy floods of 1871 in the country districts prevented the general traffic as far
at least as the carriage of wool was concerned.
The great political event of 1872 was the passing of the Education Act, which
came into force on January Ist, 1873. As the conditions of the Act are so well
known, we shall merely deal briefly with it. The principles of the Act are that free
instruction is given to all children attending State Schools in the following subjects
—reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, grammar, singing, sewing, drill, &c. If
necessary, the State also finds books and school requisites. Secular instruction —
that is instruction not necessary irreligious but unsectarian—alone is to be permitted
during the two hours before noon, and the two hours after, which are set apart as
State School hours. No restriction is placed by the Act upon the use of school
buildings for any purpose whatever on days or at hours other than those during
which they are required for secular instruction. The compulsory clause provides
that every child in the colony between the ages of six and fifteen years shall attend
school a certain number of days in each half-year, unless it can be shown by the
parents or guardians of such child that he or she is receiving instruction elsewhere,


or is incapacitated from attending school by reason of sickness, fear of infection,
infirmity, or some other equally valid cause, or there is no State School within two
miles of the residence of such child, or that he or she has been already educated up
to the prescribed standard. By the 14th section of the Act it was further provided
that any parent or guardian neglecting to send his or her child to school, and not
being able to plead any of the above excuses, may be summoned before a Justice of
the Peace, and on conviction shall be adjudicated to pay a fine not exceeding ss. for
the first offence, nor exceeding 20s. for every succeeding offence, or, in default of
payment, may be sentenced to a week’s imprisonment.
The year 1878 was one marked by prosperity, but nothing eventful occurred
during it, and it is doubtful whether, since the erection of Port Phillip into a separate
colony, there has been a corresponding period in our annals so barren of excitement
and so prolific in material blessings. The parliamentary session commenced on May
13th, and terminated on November 25th, without any change in the government of
the colony taking place in the interim. In every previous year since 1869 there had
been a change in the Administration. In 1870, the Ministry of which Mr. Macpherson
was the chief suffered defeat, and was replaced by one constructed by Sir James
McCulloch, Mr. Macpherson occupying the position of Minister of Lands. This
Government was, in its turn, defeated in 1871, upon the question of the property tax,
and a new Parliament formed by Sir Charles Gavan (then Mr.) Duffy. It barely
survived the session of 1871, and shortly after Parliament reassembled, on April 30,
1872, was defeated on an amendment, moved upon the address in reply to the
Governor’s speech, censuring the Government for the manner in which it had
dispensed its patronage. The reins of Government were then picked up by Mr.
Francis. Two attempts were made during the session to oust the Administration,
but both resulted in failure. The first was led by Mr. (now Sir James) Macßain, on
the question of the new postal contract, which was defeated by a majority of 49 to 9
votes. The other was made by the Hon. J. M. Grant, who had certainly better
grounds for his action. At the time, public indignation was very intense over the
lenient punishment meted out to Mount and Morris for their participation in the
horrors enacted on board the “ Carl,” and the hon. member for Avoca, taking
advantage of this fact, moved a resolution to the effect that the Assembly “ viewed
with alarm and disapprobation the conduct of the Government with regard to the
case of Mount and Morris.” Mr. Wilberforce Stephen replied in an exhaustive
speech to the bill of indictment preferred against the Government, and satisfied the
House that the Government had not intentionally connived at the miscarriage of
justice. The debate lasted for three nights, and resulted in the defeat of Mr. Grant’s
motion, by a majority of 40 to 25 votes. Twenty-six measures were passed into law,
and four important ones were rejected by the Legislative Council, viz.:—The
Electoral Act Amendment Bill, the Mining on Private Property Bill, the Supreme
Court Bill, and the Land Act Amendment Bill.
The year 1874 does not present to the historian anything of political incident
or of social occurrence worth recording. Nothing happened to excite the public
mind, and scarcely anything of interest occurred. At the close of the month of


January the Government of this colony abrogated the Border Treaty with New South
Wales, and consequently two coterminous divisions of the British Empire were
separated by Custom-house barriers. Looking back upon what transpired, it is not
an easy matter to realise that the colony passed through the excitement of a general
election, that it suffered the effects of a Ministerial crisis, and that it underwent the
throes of experiencing the loss of a bill for an organic alteration of the Constitution.
All these incidents produced but little impression whilst in progress, and created an
amount of apathy which caused them to be soon forgotten. The rule of Mr. Francis
gave way to the reign of Mr. Kerferd. In February of this year Ballarat was created
a separate Anglican diocese. In May following the Roman Catholic see of Melbourne
had been raised to an archbishopric, while it was determined to make Ballarat and
Sandhurst the residence of bishops of that church. In December two of these
dignitaries arrived, and were received by members of their respective creeds in a
most enthusiastic manner. At the annual gathering of the Presbyterian divines
much warmth of language was indulged in. It will therefore be seen that if secular
events showed a barrenness and dearth of interest, the same could not be said of
those relating to the ecclesiastical world. Among the memorable incidents which
happened outside the boundaries of the colony, but which excited some little interest
in Victoria, was the escape of Rochefort and his companions from New Caledonia,
and the negotiations resulting in the annexation of the Fiji Islands by Sir Hercules
Robinson to the British Empire. The latter event was followed by the visit of
Thakombau to Sydney, who was not only impressed with the power and resources of
Australia, but became impregnated with the microbes of measles, which he carried
back to the Fijis, and which succeeded in slaying by the disease 40,000 of the
natives.
The material progress of the colony was still satisfactory—the value of
imports being for the year 413,604,315, showing an increase of 476,809 over those
of 1873; while the exports amounted to 414,569,673, or an increase of 4657,834 in
excess of the previous year. A steady decline in the yield of gold was apparent, and
there was a rapid diminution in the number of persons engaged in that industry.
In 1861 there were 81,747 miners at work in Victoria; in 1871 this number had
sunk to 52,447, and during the past year it had diminished to 46,239. Railways
had been opened during the year from Castlemaine to Maryborough and Dunolly,
from Ballarat to Creswick, and from Ballarat to Beaufort. The railway revenue
showed a net return of nearly 4£ per cent, upon the capital expended, the total
earnings having been 4751,042 during the year ending June 30th, while the working
expenses were 4374,715, leaving a profit of 4476,327, or only 4142,023 less than
the gross interest on the railway loans. Upwards of 500 miles of railway were then
open, and extensions amounting to more than 300 miles had been authorised by the
Legislature. The progress made by children in education under the operation of the
new Act was satisfactory. Out of 281,876 children in the colony between the school
ages, there were 207,826 enrolled in the various State Schools, and 181,131 receiving
instruction, while the number of pupils undergoing private instruction was put down

at 18,128. According to the statistical returns of the Schools in Victoria in operation,
which were made up to December 31, 1886, there were 230,576 children on the gross
enrolment. Of the deaths which happened during the year may be mentioned that
of Professor Wilson, of the Melbourne University, and friend of the late famous
Doctor Romney Robinson, the astronomer. It was Professor Wilson who
superintended the erection of the Queen’s College Observatory, Belfast, Ireland, in
which the writer worked with Herschel’s mural circle, and who was taught how to
take observations by Doctor Robinson.
During the year 1875 two changes of Ministry took place, and three budgets
were presented. The agricultural prospects of the ensuing harvest were poor, but
pastoral pursuits had been singularly propitious. In gold mining, the year was
memorable as making the turning point in the annals of that industry. The
discoveries of gold-bearing stone in reefs at a depth of between 1600 feet and 1700
feet, at Climes and Stawell, occasioned and justified the revival of confidence in the
magnitude and inexhaustibility of the mineral resources of the colony. The dulness
which characterised commercial affairs at the beginning of 1875 continued to mark it
to its close, there, however, having been few failures of any magnitude. This year
may be considered as the first in Victoria to have been remarkable for the havoc
made among the young by epidemics, due to preventive causes.
During the whole of 1876, comprising as it did part of one and the entire of
another Legislative Session of the Assembly, Parliamentary Government was
considered to have been suspended, and it was suspected in some quarters that the
public affairs of the country had been given up to a Minister who disregarded all
responsibility of the people. As this history is not considered to be a political
history of the Colony, painted by the brush of a partisan, it would be out of place to
enter into discussions of the several successes or failures of Ministers.


CHAPTER XVII.
BRIEF RETROSPECT OF THE COLON Y.
1876-1888.
(Sr all the history of politics in Victoria for the past twelve years has been
itmm written in the biographies of the principal actors concerned therein, in
! another portion of these volumes, it would be mere tautology to repeat
it here, and therefore after a review of the Colony from 1876 to
1888, the History shall be brought to a close, seeing that it would be useless to
enumerate facts known to people who are contemporaneous with the events which
have occurred during the last ten years. We thought it necessary to dwell on the
earlier part of the history of the Colony on a large scale, as so few now live who
could enumerate the facts connected therewith, and moreover it must be
remembered that history is not that which concerns the present so much the past.
It is as difficult to write a history without imparting your political bias, as it is for
an artist to paint a picture without the necessary colours. But this is by the way.
When self-government was conceded the Imperial Parliament likewise handed
over to the Victorian Legislature the sole control of the Crown lands of the colony ;
the value of which was estimated to amount to £200,000,000 sterling. Their total
area is 56,446,720 acres, and of this 17,290,927 acres had been wholly alienated or
were in process of alienation at the end of the year 1876, the residue available for
selection, after deducting reserves and land unsuitable for settlement being
12,994,820 acres. The rateable property of the colony amounted in value to
£43,435,832, which yielded a total revenue of £595,146. The rateable property of
the 59 cities, towns, and boroughs then in existence was valued at £29,638,515, and
the revenue gained therefrom was £446,256, that of Melbourne being £112,653. In
each shire, city, town, or borough, the whole machinery of local government is in
the hands of the ratepayers; and the only officers nominated by the central
Government are the Justices of the Peace. In a British community the newspaper
press is more than what may be termed “ not an unimportant factor,” but it is to be
feared that the Press relying on its power disregards the dissemination of that
knowledge for which it gets and claims credit even up to the present. But leaving
aside what to many educated men is a burning question we may descend from the
higher regions of thought to those of infinitely lower degree. The population of
Victoria was then estimated to be 860,000, and its growth from 1835 up to 1878
may be considered almost phenomenal. The Government expenditure of the colony
was very large. For the year ending June 30th, 1877, it amounted to £4,529,798 ;
the estimates for 1878 being £5,100,000. Large public works, such as railways and
reservoirs, were at the time under the charge of the Government.


The total amount of indebtedness of Victoria was £17,011,382, which was a
fraction of under £2O per head. During the preceding twenty-six years a sum
amounting to ,£81,(300,000 was expended by the Government on public works of
various descriptions. There were twelve banks of issue in Victoria, whose liabilities
in 1876 were £16,527,277; their assets being put down at £23,918,123; and the
shareholders were paid on an average 10J per cent. Savings banks and building
societies were in a thoroughly flourishing condition, the return giving a total of fifty-
eight of these institutions, with an income during 1876 of £1,011,397. In the matter
of public works the colony was also progressing, for in 1878 there were nearly 1000
miles of railway open for traffic. The total number of miles of telegraph wire in use
in Victoria in 1876 was 4,812, and there were then extensions to the amount of 319
miles in progress. Throwing aside the vexed question of free-trade v. protection,
which it is supremely ridiculous and useless to discuss, it may be stated that the
commerce ot the colony was satisfactory. The largest article of export was that of
wool, the gold production having declined. The Merino wools of Victoria have a
peculiar value, and cannot be equalled for softness or brilliancy in any other part of
the world. While on the subject of wool, it may be stated that the number of sheep
at the time referred to in the different colonies was as follows :—Victoria, 11,720,000 ;
New South Wales, 24,500,000; Queensland, 7,315,000; South Australia, 6,138,000;
and Western Australia, 890,000. As regards agriculture, a steady increase in the
amount ot production was visible. In the year ended March, 1877, the gross returns
were as follows:—Wheat, 5,279,730 bushels ; oats, 2,294,225 bushels ; barley,
530,323 bushels. The principal grain districts are the valleys and plains of the
Goulburn, Wimmera (which is the garden of Victoria), Richardson, Loddon, Avoca,
and Murray, all of them on the inland side of the Great Dividing Range. The weight
ot grain in Victoria to the bushel has never been exceeded in any country in the
world, it having amounted to 691b. in several well authenticated cases. While
speaking of agriculture it may be well to state that the total area devoted to the
production ot grapes in 1877 was 4,765 acres, and the produce amounted to 101,011
cwt. Wines ot a good quality are made, and only require to be a little more known
in order to ensure a ready market in Europe. The olive thrives well, but the oil
hardly pays for the cost of gathering the fruit. On the mountain ranges the
strawberry, raspberry, and currant grow abundantly. The commerce of the colony
in 1878 was in a satisfactory condition, even as to the import of books, the total cost
of which amounted to £431,175, a sum showing that although jewellery and toys
amounted to £281,000, the intellectual portion of the community is greater than the
fantastical. The exports for the year amounted to over £14,000,000. The extreme
length of the colony from east to west is about 420 miles, and its greatest breadth
about 250 miles. Its coast line is nearly 600 geographical miles, and its area 88,198
square miles. The provident, charitable, literary, artistic, scientific and social
institutions of the country compare favourably with those of older countries. Among
important productive public works of Victoria, than which there is no country more
purely British, may be mentioned those for the supply of water to the inhabitants and
a network of railway of 1700 miles. The cost of construction (inclusive of rolling
stock, and building a bridge over the Murray to connect with the New South Wales
lines) has been over £21,620,000, or an average of about £13,000 per mile.


According to the latest returns there are in the colony 134 flour mills, which,
during the past year, operated upon 7,218,805 bushels of wheat, and 475,997 bushels
of other grain ; 74 breweries, in which 14,753,152 gallons of beer were brewed ; 227
brickyards and potteries, which made over 158,990,150 bricks, and pottery to the
value of J648,130; 152 tanneries, fellmongeries and wool-washing establishments,
which tanned 2,162,900 hides and skins, and obtained over 11,000,000 lbs. of wool
by stripping skins ; 9 woollen mills, which used 1,797,947 lbs. of wool, and produced
1,114,241 yards of tweed, cloth and flannel, and 2905 pairs of blankets ; 33 soaj) and
candle works, which made 125,678 cwt. of soap, and 37,245 cwt. of candles; 12
tobacco manufactories, which manufactured 918,066 lbs. of tobacco, 6345 lbs. of
snuff and 9,172,600 cigars and cigarettes; 7 distilleries, which made 216,161 gallons
of spirits; 146 establishments working in books or stationery; in musical
instruments, 8 ; carving figures, &c., 2 ; designs, medals and dies, 6 ; philosophical
instruments, &c., 5; surgical instruments, 4; arms, ammunition, &c., 9; machines,
tools and implements, 273; carriages and harness, 249 ; ships and boats, 20; houses,
buildings, Ac., 59; furniture, 141 ; chemicals, 47 ; textile fabrics, 9 ; dress, 208 ;
fibrous materials, 27; animal food, 46 ; vegetable food, 181 ; drinks and stimulants,
267; animal matters, 247; vegetable matters, 509 ; coal and lighting, 22 ; stone,
clay, earthenware and glass, 279 ; ice, 3 ; gold, silver and precious stones, 23 ; metals
other than gold and silver, 33. The total number of these establishments is 2813.
Agriculture has also made rapid progress in the colony, as may be gathered
from the following figures : For the year ended March 1, 1886, there were 38,384
farm holdings in the colony, while the extent of land under cultivation amounts to
2,405,157 acres. For the same year the gross produce of principal crops was : Wheat,
9,170,538 bushels; oats, 4,692,303 bushels; barley, 1,302,854 bushels; potatoes,
163,202 tons ; hay, 442,118 tons. It must be remembered that the development of
agriculture has had a comparatively recent commencement, for during the most
prosperous period of the gold diggings the land was in the possession of Crown tenants,
who leased it as sheep and cattle runs, and many years passed before the new
colonists, attracted by the discovery of gold, succeeded in passing laws for the
throwing open of the land to agricultural settlers. Up to the year 1860 land could
only be obtained at auction, and it was difficult for men of small means to get farms,
and although more liberal land laws were passed after that date, it was not until 1869
that an act was framed under which agricultural settlement was effectually
encouraged. It thus happened that during the period intervening between the
landing of the first white man and the passing of the act of 1869 agricultural
settlement made very slow progress. The wheat now grown in Victoria is the finest
in the world. It always brings the highest price in the London market, fetching
considerably more than English, Indian, American or New Zealand wheat. The
pastoral industry was prosperous almost from the earliest days in Victoria. The
quantity of wool produced in the colony in the year 1885 was 53,390,100 lb., valued
at T2,960,890. Wine growing has made rapid strides of late years. It cannot be
doubted that in the future this will be a great wine producing country. At
llutherglen there are five wine growers, cultivating an average of 250 acres each, and
147 farmers an average of 12 acres each. The whole of the northern slopes of the


ranges in the centre of Victoria, from Stawell to Bendigo, a zigzag line ot 200 miles
of mountains and gullies is dotted with small vineyards. The shire ol Stawell
includes 70 vineyards, three of which have an average of 00 acres. There are
similar plantations at Ararat, Marong, Bendigo, Emu Creek, Castlemaine, Goulburn,
the Murray, Lilydale and other places. The yearly value of manufactured goods is
computed at T18,500,000 ; the imports of the colony are valued at T19,000,000, and
the exports at TIG,000,000; pastoral produce about T10,000,000, agricultural
produce about T7,000,000.
The business of the thirteenth Parliament, which met on June 7, 1887, passed
amongst other measures a new Licensing Act, which is known as the Licensing Act
1885 Amendment Bill. Politically, socially, and intellectually, the Colony has for
the past ten years shown a favorable growth; it would be of course unreasonable to
expect in a new colony, which is only 50 odd years old, that calm, high-toned, and
deliberative atmosphere which pervades European and other countries. The Press
is here, as elsewhere, a powerful factor in moulding public opinion, and has assumed
great dimensions, as there are publications suited to all sorts and conditions
of men. On the 20th of January the Centenary of Australia was celebrated, and it
may be said that we have great cause for thankfulness in the prosperity and security
of the entire continent. In Victoria our defences alone are quite capable of giving
an enemy, according to Sir James Lorimer, a warm reception, which would be
intensified did he happen to attack us when the gunboats lately ordered for the
Australian stations arrive. Amongst some of the interesting events that transpired
during 1887 was the holding of the Queen’s Jubilee, when Melbourne, with her usual
loyalty to and love for Her Most Gracious Majesty, behaved in the manner which
has always characterised her. No expense was spared to make the celebration a
success, and sentiments of nationality were breathed on all sides. The return of the
Hon. Alfred Deakin from his tour through America and Europe was also a matter of
great importance to Victorians, since with his previously acquired experience he was
enabled to expound in his brilliant and eloquent manner, the opinion he formed of
the feelings of the people of the old country. He is an Australian native and has
rendered eminent service to the land of his birth, but in no direction more fitly than
in that of an irrigation scheme.
To Mr. McColl is due the advocacy in the first place of this valuable method
of causing barrenness to be converted into fertility. To Bishop Moorhouse, the late
Bishop of Melbourne, a word of praise must be rendered for also advocating, in a
certain sense, a scheme for securing prosperity, to the farmers ; and to Mr. Deakin
for his enthusiastic support of a proper measure.
One other event connected with the annals of the Jubilee year was the
retirement of Mr. Peter Lalor on a pension, and the appointment of Mr. M. H.
Davies as Speaker. This latter gentleman, since his selection for such a responsible
position, has proved that the choice was a wise one, as he has acted, though a novice
in the Chair, in a dignified and impartial manner.
The retrospect of the colony’s history is cheering, and it is to be hoped that
the prophecy of its future advancement which is believed by Victorians, and held by the
writer, will find it, when its Centennial history comes to be written, amply verified.

EDWIN THOMAS SMITH, M.P., J.P.
MAYOR OF ADELAIDE.
T SIpEN are not everywhere born free as Jean Jacques and his school would
93S VI have it, nor are they everywhere slaves, unless they, by what almost
seems a persistent carelessness and a cultivated indifference, render
themselves so. While many ills from which we suffer are not of our own creation,
so also are there not a few which our own conduct has brought upon us. Man
ofttimes forges his own manacles and fetters, and then turns round and rails at
fortune. In countries which enjoy a well-defined liberty, he may, by his own
determined will, rise to any grade of elevation, or in those where tyranny holds
sway, he can by a cleverly acted servility, achieve a comparative degree of
prominence, possibly a great amount of power, but lacking these qualities, if there
be no suspension of the usual law, he may fall to any depth of degradation. The
absence of skill begets the presence of defeat; wherever license takes the place of
liberty, then the rights due to others are appropriated by adventurers. Wherever
tyranny is the rule and not the exception, there the sycophant, patiently suffering
under injustice, and religiously observing moderation, makes his way to power.
Then again, the absence of impatience begets the presence of success. Russia
affords an instance of the country of tyranny, South America that of license. The
action of the buccaneer consists in the appropriation of the property of others, be
it goods or be it rights. The behaviour of the Jew exhibits itself in patience. In
the former case the success achieved is questionable—the conditions forbid it —in
the latter case the victory gained is assured—the circumstances support it. Now, in
this country the constitution is so nicely balanced, and the social code so accurately
regulated, that the predatory instinct is stifled (at times there are exceptions); it is not
dead, it is dormant; it is kept in the background, suppressed, held in check by the
law, while the clever band of flatterers cannot ply their calling owing to the
manliness of a large section of the people. Accepting the premises, the conclusion
follows that this country is not the home of license, nor the throne of tyranny, and,
therefore, there is the golden mean. We anticipate the reader. Wherefore this ? he
is about to interrogate. To show that in this country it is possible to increase in
prosperity without encroaching on the rights of others, and without the adventitious
aid of flattery. This is a country of competition. Competition, it is said, is a base
thing, for the weak go to the wall, and the survival of the fittest doctrine is thereby
acknowledged. Competition may be, and is, a base thing, if it is understood
to mean taking advantage of another, but taking advantage of opportunities is quite
a different thing, and when it is open to all to make an effort, it is surely legitimate
to seize every point of vantage ground. Again, suppose influence be substituted for


competition ; would not the impoverished, the unknown, the man of no friends go to
the wall? Decidedly. Then it would be the survival, not of the fittest, but of the
most influential. A certain monarch said that a man is fit to hold any position he
can get, otherwise the age of intellectual, commercial, political and religious
decrepitude would set in! Inventive genius would no longer exist. Mental
momentum would undergo an abrupt check, and pure religion would be supplanted
by a penitential mechanism. Curiosity, not that vulgar weed, but disinterested
curiosity, would give way to mysticism and reverie. A contempt for life and for its
advantages would ensue, and commerce would be ruined. Manliness would turn to
effeminacy, effeminacy to defeat, defeat to disgrace ; courage to bravado, bravado to
socialism; patriotism to faction, faction to bloodshed; moderation to asceticism,
asceticism to superstition, and fertility to sterility.
The writer remembers a celebrated Irish wit, to whom he put the question,
“What caused the decline and fall of the Roman Empire?” answering in reply
“ Because the people had begun to wear kid gloves.” The reply was an involved
one, but what he intended to convey was that the manliness of the people had been
undermined by their effeminacy, and since their bodies became weakened by luxury,
they would neither fight the battles of their country, nor those of their individual
lives. South Australia is a colony holding out inducements to the man of moral
strength, who may, by a proper course of conduct, gain a comfortable position in
life. One of these is Mr. Edwin Thomas Smith, M.P., J.P., the present Mayor of
Adelaide, and well known as a gentleman who has identified himself with the interests
of the colony. Mr. Smith was born at Walsall, Staffordshire, in 1831, and early
took an interest in political questions in England. He arrived in South Australia in
1853, and began business as an importer. His love for politics urged him to take a
prominent part in the discussion of the questions then (1853-5) under consideration
—Manhood suffrage, the Ballot Act, and abolition of State aid to religion. He
afterwards joined Mr. Logue, of the Old Kent Town Brewery, and on the death of
that gentleman, the whole business came into Mr. Smith’s hands. The handsome
brewery, which now faces the traveller on the road from Adelaide to Kent Town,
was built by him in the year 1875.
He was Mayor of Norwood and Kensington in the years 1867-8-9, and again in
1872-3. He entered Parliament, for the first time, in 1872, as the representative of
East Torrens, and has made for himself a name and a reputation as an independent
member, who is ever ready to assist in all measures which will advance the colony.
He was offered a portfolio under the Blyth and Morgan administrations, which he
declined, but accepted office in the latter days of the Bray Ministry in 1884, as
Minister of Education. The respect in which he is held was fully proved when both
Houses of the Legislature gave him a banquet on the occasion of his visit to Europe
in 1877. He was elected Mayor of Adelaide in 1879, and held the same dignified
position for three years consecutively. He is now again chief magistrate of the
city in this the jubilee year of Her Majesty’s reign, and has consequently a civic
record far surpassing that of the celebrated Sir Richard Whittington, a fact on
EDWIN THOMAS SMITH, M.P., J.P.


which Mr. Smith was recently complimented by Sir Robert Fowler, himself an
ex-Lord Mayor of London. He has taken a deep interest in various schemes tor
improving and beautifying Adelaide, and the Torrens Lake and other works are
lasting evidence of his energy and good judgment. Mr. Smith has supported all
kinds of manly sports, and is at the present time Patron, President, and
Vice-President of over fifty clubs and associations, and his hospitality has been
extended at his beautiful residence, Marryatville, to many of the cricket and football
clubs from the other colonies, while on a visit to Adelaide.
It was through Mr. Smith’s instrumentality that the tramway system was
introduced into Adelaide, and he has rendered valuable services on the boards of
management of the Hospital, Blind Asylum, Savings Bank, and other public and
charitable institutions.
His popularity has been recently enhanced by his advocacy of an Adelaide Jubilee
Exhibition, in the promotion of which he was the prime mover, after that the House
refused to encourage the idea. He suggested the practicability of the scheme on
the lines on which it is now being carried out, without being a burden to the
Treasurer’s coffers except by special subsidy, and it is mainly owing to his energy
that the undertaking has proved a most pronounced success. He is
Vice-President of the Commission, and Chairman of the Committee of Promoters,
and is a guarantor in the affair to the extent of TSOOO. During his terms of office,
and, indeed, out of office, he has been approachable by every person, and he always
lends a willing ear and renders timely assistance to every case of distress. Mr.
Smith is of medium height, and is somewhat forcible-looking in appearance. On a
first meeting, he gives the idea of geniality and general friendliness, by manifesting
a courteous interest in any subject brought under his notice, and although his
liberality may be at times severely taxed, yet he never fails to enforce the lesson of
self-reliance. This may be accounted for from the fact, that he himself has had to
study the different conditions of life, and has had to depend entirely on his own
business capacities for success. In matters of great moment, whether affecting
municipalities, charitable institutions, religious objects, or politics generally, his
name stands amongst the first of those gentlemen whose opinion is listened to with
respect. As a proof of his sterling character, it may be stated that although the
position he occupies in commercial life is antagonistic to a certain class of the
community, yet this does not debar Mr. Smith from exercising his principles on
their behalf so far as it lays within his power, or them from seeking his assistance,
as witness the numerous contributions to their funds. As an employer, none can
surpass him in the respect with which he is held by his employes , many of whom are
now of long years’ standing; and as regards his hospitality, it may be said that
hundreds of visitors, from the old country or elsewhere, are indebted to him for a
cordial welcome when visiting the shores of South Australia, in all of which cases
the guests owe much to Mr. Smith. Altogether Mr. Smith has been a most
prominent and useful citizen for many years past, and deserves the gratitude of
South Australians.
EDWIN THOMAS SMITH, M.P., J.P.


HONORABLE RICHARD CHAFFEY BAKER, M.L.C., C.M.G.
by the career of the Hon. Richard Chaffey Baker, we may say that
cl ®| E he is one who possesses the inherent qualities of courage and perseverance
iave contributed to the development of South Australia. He is the
eldest son of the late Hon. John Baker, of Morialta, South Australia, and was born
on June 23rd, 1842. His father was Premier and Chief Secretary ot the second
ministry under Responsible Government. Mr. Baker was educated at Eton, and
Trinity College, Cambridge, and went out in the mathematical tripos as 8.A., in
1864, high up in the list of senior optimes, taking the M.A. degree in 1870. Having
studied for the legal profession he was called to the Bar, Lincoln’s Inn, in June,
1864, and shortly afterwards sailed for South Australia. He married Katharine
Edith, daughter of the late Richard Bowen Colley, in the year 1865.
Mr. Baker became a member of the Legislative Council in 1877, and took office
as Minister of Justice and Education, in the Colton Ministry, on June 16, 1884, which,
by a remarkable coincidence, lasted for one year exactly, terminating on June 16,
1885. He was appointed as special envoy in 1885-6, from the Australian colonies to
Great Britain, to negotiate on postal union matters between that country and the
colonies. This appointment necessitated his visiting the other colonies interested in
the question, and from them he obtained the sanction to appear on their behalf.
This was a matter of the most delicate nature, and demanded great carefulness
and foresight, for on it depended a saving to the colonies, annually, of many
thousands of pounds, if carried out successfully. Although his mission was not
quite so satisfactory as was at first anticipated, yet it is gratifying to state, while this
biography is in course of being written, that an amicable arrangement has been
concluded, and one which is mainly due to Mr. Baker’s endeavours. This fact, of
itself, is a sufficient proof of the confidence reposed in him by Australian legislators
generally. In 1886, the Home Government appreciated his efforts to such an
extent, that Her Majesty was advised to confer on him the Order of St. Michael and
St. George.
Mr. Baker is the first native-born South Australian who sat as a member of the
House of Assembly, acted as a member of a South Australian ministry, occupied a
seat in the Legislative Council, and received a decoration from the Queen. He is
one of those men whose character is strongly individual, and who at once engages
one’s attention. This striking individuality, which is deeply marked in every action,
suggests that Mr. Baker possesses the courage of his convictions even at the
expense of appearing singular. Though the prime of life has passed, so far at least


as years are concerned, yet the spring of youth is plainly visible, and a vigour is
perceptible, which indicates a care of preservation not usually met with, especially
among the colonial born. To one who has been subjected to the climatic changes of
the colony in which he resides, heat and cold are trying, but by him appear to have
been treated with indifference. His rhetorical powers are not of the highest order,
but when necessity demands, and the question under discussion is one to his mind,
the fire of his zeal is at once manifest by the flow of his words, not in declamation
so much as in sincerity of purpose.
At the bar his face is seldom seen, and then only in the higher courts, although
the firm with which he is identified (Messrs. Baker and Barlow), holds a high
position in matters appertaining to the law, being retained by several banks and
investing institutions in the colony, as well as representing many large trusts, while
in several of the most important cases that come before the court, they invariably
hold a brief. As already stated, Mr. Baker represented the district of Barossa in the
House of Assembly for a considerable length of time, but was ultimately defeated by
Mr. J. W. H. Sudholz, who was unseated at the court of Disputed Returns following
the election, on Mr. Baker’s petition.
Although Mr. Baker, at this time, received many requisitions to represent other
districts, as well as to occupy the vacant seat to which he was justly entitled, yet he
declined, and held aloof from politics until the year 1877, when he was returned for
the Legislative Council. He is a member of the New University Club, St. James
N., and the Adelaide Club, Adelaide.
The contracts entered into by the Australian Colonies for the carriage of
their mails to and from England, and the manner in which the colonies respectively
contributed to the amount paid to the steamship companies, have hitherto been
in a most unsatisfactory condition. Each colony has acted separately, and great
jealousies and soreness have arisen in consequence. In addition to this, the
postages received for mail matter to and from Great Britain and the colonies
have been divided between the Imperial Government and the respective colonies
in a manner which is not only so complicated as to be almost unintelligible,
but which is also unfair to the colonies.
Early in 1885, Mr. Baker conceived the idea of forming a Postal Union
between Great Britain, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia (and
ultimately the other Australian Colonies), so that tenders might be called for
on behalf of all the members of the Union for an united service, to come into
force on the termination of the then existing mail contracts, the total cost thereof
being paid by all such members in proportion to the postages received by them
for the mail matter carried.
Having received authority from his colleagues, Mr. Baker succeeded in
negotiating a contract between the three colonies named (to which Queensland,
Western Australia, and Tasmania were to be afterwards invited to become parties),
and in recognition of his services he was authorised to act for the three
contracting colonies in London, and secure, if possible, the entrance of the British

S9J
Post Office into the Union. In this he was completely successful, and the
British Post Office acceded to all the terms demanded by the colonies, and
called for tenders from the steamship companies. With these tenders Mr. Baker
had nothing to do, as he resigned his position a few days after they were received,
in consequence of being obliged to leave England. Satisfactory arrangements have,
however, since been entered into between Great Britain, on behalf of herself and
the colonies, for the weekly mail services specified in the contract negotiated by Mr.
Baker, and the change of postages arranged for will come into force simultaneously
with such new service.
Leading Articles, &c. re Australian Postal Union, contributed by Mr.
Baker, have been published in the S. A. Advertiser, January 11th, 1886 ; Australian
Times and Anglo-New Zealander, October 9th, 1885 ; Times (London), February Ist
and 2nd, 1886; Pall Mall Gazette, February 19th, 1886 (copied into Adelaide
Observer of April 3rd, 1886).
HONORABLE RICHARD CHAFFEY BAKER, M.L.C., C.M.G.


THE HONORABLE GEORGE CHARLES HAWKER M.P.
staple product of Australia is wool, and the success that has attended
i^ s cultivation, has been, with few exceptions, very marked. There is no
enterprise possessing immunity from risk, no more than there is any ship
sailing the seas free from a perilous and perhaps disastrous voyage. The current of
circumstances may, in the former case, be adverse, the waves of the ocean may, in
the latter case, be lashed into fury, and loss in both instances may be the result. But,
nevertheless, public enterprise proceeds, and ships put out to sea. If men are to be
daunted by the losses sustained by others, what would become of a country ?
Happily there is no lack of public spirit in the colonies, and men who have
embarked their fortunes in various undertakings, have generally succeeded. The
most important factor in their success is apparent at the first glance, and that is,
that they have brought to the pursuit of their business, a practical and complete
knowledge of its requirements. Think first of what you are going to write, and
then write it, is capital and wholesome advice to the man who wishes to discuss a
point; but equally capital and wholesome is the advice to the man of business :
think first of what and how you are going to do a thing, and then do it. This is the
desideratum, and it is the possession of this desideratum, which has crowned the
efforts of the successful men of business in Australia.
But we began by saying that the staple product of Australia is wool, and that is
true, as the immense resources possessed by this country for wool-growing are great,
and, as yet, but partially developed. Australia is also an agricultural country. The
advantages held out to settlers are numerous, and although the seasons are
sometimes fickle (every country has fickle seasons), yet a degree of comfort is visible
among the farming classes. South Australia is an agricultural and pastoral country.
It is true it possesses numerous and various industries of stability and vitality; it
has copper mines which have yielded almost fabulous returns; it has rich silver
mines, but little or no gold, at least, so far as yet discovered. For its copper, there
is now little or no demand, owing to the well-known fact of iron being substituted
for timber in the construction of ships, while silver is becoming depreciated in value
all the world over; and, as already stated, the gold unearthed up to the present is
trifling. It was expected that Teetulpa would prove a second El Dorado, but the
expectation has not been realised. It is accordingly on the agricultural and pastoral
industry that South Australia must largely rely. No claim is advanced for anything
original in the foregoing remarks —they are well known to South Australian colonists,
but°as this volume will fall into the hands of those who lose sight of these facts, and
of many resident in other colonies, it was deemed advisable to recount them afresh.
We are dealing more especially with the wool industry, and only mention
incidentally that of the agricultural, the reason for doing so being obvious, as the
gentleman, whose biographical sketch we give, has been largely interested in pastoral
pursuits to which reference shall be made later on. The Honorable George Charles
Hawker is the second son of the late Admiral Edward Hawker, of Ashford Lodge,


Hants, England, and was born on September 21, 1818. He was educated on the
Continent, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated as 8.A., in May, 1840,
proceeding to the degree of M.A., in 1854.
He sailed for South Australia in the month of May, 1848, and arrived there on
September 6of the same year. He engaged in pastoral pursuits in the north, which
proved very successful. He was returned as member for the district of Victoria, in
1858, and again in 1860, and was elected Speaker of the new House of Assembly,
in opposition to the Honorable Boyle Travers Finnis (Chief Secretary), and Mr.
Francis S. Button, by a large majority. In 1863 he was again returned for the
district of Victoria, and was elected Speaker without opposition. After an absence
of some years from the colony, he was again returned for his old district in 1875,
1878, and 1881. Mr. Hawker was Treasurer in Mr. (now Sir Arthur) Blyth’s
ministry for a short time in the year 1875, when this ministry was turned out. He
joined Mr. Boucaut as Chief Secretary in 1876, but this ministry had a short life,
as it only lasted about two months. He was appointed Minister of Public Works in
Mr. Boucaut’s ministry from October, 1877, to September, 1878, and in Mr. Morgan’s
ministry from the latter date to June, 1881, when that gentleman resigned from
ill-health.
In the years 1884 and 1887, Mr. Hawker was returned for the district of
North Adelaide, which seat he still continues to hold. The above is a brief outline
of Mr. Hawker’s parliamentary life.
It may be added that his eldest son, Mr. E. W. Hawker, also occupies a seat in
the House of Assembly.
We have already alluded to his success in pastoral pursuits, which can be
ascribed to years of unremitting toil, and no inconsiderable expense. His flocks
have obtained a world-wide reputation in the English and foreign markets, and in
all the Australian colonies, consequent on the superior breed of sheep, known as
that of the long-woolled merino, which he has carefully and scientifically cultivated,
and which have received many prizes.
His run at Bungaree, near Clare, is a magnificent estate, and is well
known as a popular resort, especially to some of the nobility who have visited South
Australia, and who have been partakers of his hospitality. Mr. Hawker is a
gentleman of goodly proportions, and still carries with him the distinctive type of a
good old English gentleman. He has always taken a leading position in the House
of Assembly, and is considered an able speaker, although his address listened to for
the first time would not appear effective. His grasp of ideas, however, and his
persistency in adhering to them, does not fail to produce a lasting impression. In
any other matters but those of politics he does not take a very active part, and
although he is seldom seen on public platforms, yet his influence is frequently
sought for. As a Minister of the Crown, no man has ever held a portfolio who has been,
and still is, more highly respected, while his rising on the floor of the House is
received with the greatest attention. His views, as a rule, do not appear to run
with the multitude, as it is always clearly seen that his ideas have been thought out
upon his own lines, before attempting to give them publicity.
THE HONORABLE GEORGE CHARLES HAWKER, M.P.


JOHN MITCHELL BARR.
«OHN Mitchell Barr was born in Paisley, Scotland, in 1836. At an early
i|py E age removed to Partick, a suburb of Glasgow, where his father had
a 'HUP* extensive dye works. He was brought up to mercantile pursuits in an
office in Glasgow, but when about seventeen, in the year 1852, he sailed for
Melbourne in the ship “ Sir William Moles worth,” one of the first under the
co-operative system, owned by the passengers. The passage was made in 154 days.
After a short interval in Melbourne he went with a party to Bendigo goldfields, and
carried on digging until the revolt of the miners against the tyranny with which the
goldfields were governed, culminated in the Ballarat Stockade tragedy. On Bendigo
the movement against the license fee took the form of the Red Ribbon League, whose
motto was “ Taxation without representation is robbery,” and with many others he
was imprisoned by “ Bendigo Mac ” for the share taken by him in the protest. With
varying fortunes he followed the “rushes” for several years and at length settled down
at McCallum’s Creek (now Craigie), near Maryborough, where, with a partner, he
engaged in dairying and stock raising. The large “ rushes ”of Talbot, Majorca, and
Chinaman’s Flat, took place and brought a great population to the district. In
despite of good fortune in mining, the losses of stock through pleura-pneumonia
forced the partners to sell out. Mr. Barr married in 1863, and shortly after was
compelled to give up mining, having exhausted all his capital, and being actually in
debt for the necessaries of life. Under these circumstances he was attached to the
staff of the Majorca Independent , first as reporter and after as editor, which position
he held until 1870, when he was appointed town clerk and treasurer of the borough
of Majorca. For ten years he occupied that position, and during the same period he
was four times elected as a member of the Maryborough Mining Board, and was
twice chairman of that body. The Municipal Conference of 1874, which led to
important changes in the municipal law in favour of these bodies, and re-affirmed the
principle of state endowment, was originated and carried to a successful issue by him,
as secretary to the movement. He received the thanks of nearly every corporate
body in the colony. The Electoral Conference of 1876, which led to the introduction
of a Bill to amend the division and seats of the electorate, was also started and
carried out under his Secretaryship. At this period his hands were literally full, as,
in addition to his duties as town clerk, he had also those pertaining to his position
as Member of the Mining Board, Secretaryship of Conferences, a considerable
business in Fire and Life Insurances, and the legal managership of a number of
Mining Companies, while at the same time a news agency and bookseller’s shop was
carried on by his wife and family. In 1877, when the McCulloch Ministry had to


face the country under the Amended Electoral Act, Mr. Barr, as one of those who
had prominently assisted in the measure, was returned to Parliament as member for
Maryborough and Talbot, in opposition to the sitting members, Messrs. Stewart and
Fraser, he being a pronounced Liberal and Protectionist, while his opponents were
Free-traders. He held this position until 1884, having during that period gone through
three elections, defeating even the prominent barrister, Mr. J. L. Purves, in one of
the elections. In the meanwhile, however, Mr. Barr had resigned his position of
town clerk, sold out his business at Majorca, and received several valuable
testimonials of the esteem in which he was held in the district with which he had so
long been identified. He then entered into partnership with the Hon. A. T. Clark,
M.P. for Williamstown, and W. M. Clark, M.P. for Footscray, as joint proprietors of
the Williamstoivn Advertiser, with an Auctioneer’s and Estate Agency added thereto.
Such a combination of three members of Parliament in partnership had considerable
political influence, especially when one of the members was a Cabinet Minister as
Commissioner of Customs ; but the association although very successful, did not
last long, a dissolution of partnership took place, and Mr. Barr with Mr. W. M.
Clark started, in 1883, a new paper, the Independent, at Footscray, a rising suburb of
Melbourne. The paper has become a “household word” in that locality, and is very
successful. Mr. Barr combines with it the business of an auctioneer, land and
estate agency, and is also Secretary of the local building society. He has contributed
to the press at various times a number of original tales, poems, and sketches of life
on the goldfields.

REV. EDWARD G. VEAL.
Wr«fP EN liave keen lecl in evei T age to embrace the life of a religions teacher
'wl| from different motives—some out of pure selfishness, some out of
contempt for the things of this world, some to display their learning, but
the majority for the sake of the work. To a worldly minded man the wonder is that
so many are found willing to commit themselves to a life of self-denial, and in some
instances one of comparative penury, when other professions hold out such tempting
inducements, but it is this very spirit animating the clergy that contributes so much
to modify the wild aspirations of sections of the community. Crime, it is true, is
principally kept in check by law, or the fear of losing the good opinion of others, but
inordinate aspirations are chiefly restrained by religion. Hence the necessity of
religion, and, by consequence, of those who teach it. Although the invention of
printing proved a formidable rival to the pulpit, by displacing to a great extent oral
instruction, yet the most impartial critics admit that it still has great influence over
the hearts and minds of men. “If there are disadvantages,” writes Dr. Draper, “in
the method of acquiring knowledge by reading, there are also signal advantages; for
though upon the printed page the silent letters are mute and unsustained by any
scenic help, yet often —a wonderful contradiction—they pour forth emphatic
eloquence, that can make the heart leap with emotion, or kindle on the cheek the
blush of shame. The might of persuasiveness does not always lie in articulate
speech. The strong are often the silent. God never speaks.” Altering Galileo’s
words somewhat, we might say He speaks for all that. Those snow-capped
mountains kissing the deep blue of the sky speak of a purity and serenity unattainable
here; that daisy trodden carelessly underfoot holds out an emblem of simplicity for
which the hardened heart at times may well sigh; the very dawn chasing black night
is prophetic of a certain great event for which man hopes; the twittering of the birds
welcoming the return of day is emblematic of the joy in store elsewhere ; while that
uprising sun wiping the dew from every blade of grass is indicative of the cessation
of sorrow at least. Yes, He speaks for all that. And again, what scene, howsoever
graphically described ; what subject, howsoever exquisitely illustrated on the
printed page, can equal the same when clothed in language and delivered to a
listening throng? None. For the scene, the subject, have now become flesh and
blood— a living thing, a being—and each auditor feels a magnetic influence at work—
the unseen agent always acting powerfully when there is a number of people, since
numbers create enthusiasm, and enthusiasm creates impression.
But enough; it is not an apology for the existence of the church we write,
since she is a recognised factor of civilization—of the highest civilization—and is


endeared to many by the most touching incidents of their lives. For at her font
they received their names, at her altar they plighted their vows, and, hush! beneath
those grassy mounds rest the ashes of those near and dear to them, awaiting
the resurrection.
The profoundest thought, the holiest sentiment of humanity, is connected
with the church, for she is a witness to eternal truth which is spiritual; and when
mankind has sought for pleasure in all that his senses can enjoy, he finds that
pleasure is not happiness, and that since he is capable of happiness, it must be
searched for elsewhere. Thus it happens that the religious life, although in a certain
sense an abstract life (some people say it is analogous to the printed page; well, if Dr.
Draper be correct, it must be a powerful agent), has an effect upon and modifies the
material life ; and in a country like Australia, where there is a thirst for collecting
riches, it is necessary that there should be those willing to discharge the functions
of a clergyman.
This volume contains sketches of several clergymen, one of whom is the Rev.
Edward Gritton Yeal. He was born on February 15, 1853, at Ramsgate, Kent. His
parents, John William and Emily Bartram Yeal, were both trained as teachers at
Cheltenham College, England, from which they obtained certificates of competency.
Mr. Yeal was named after his sponsors, the Rev. Canon Edward Hoare, M.A., now
rector of Trinity, Tunbridge Wells, England, and the Rev. John Gritton, D.D., for
some years a Church Missionary Society clergyman in India. He was educated
principally by his father, and during the short period he was at the Church of
England Grammar School, Melbourne, his career was marked with considerable
success. Leaving this institution he went to assist his father at St. John’s School,
Melbourne, and afterwards spent five years in mercantile pursuits. In 1874, at the
age of twenty-one, he was accepted by Dean Macartney as a candidate for the
ministry, and was immediately appointed to the District of Dromana, under the Rev.
R. Curwen Campbell, M.A., incumbent of Mornington. Having passed two
successive examinations —one at Trinity and the other at Christmas, in the year 1875
—he was entitled to enter Moore College, Liverpool, New South Wales, then the
only theological college for Church of England divinity students in the colonies.
This institution he entered in July, 1876, and, at the close of the first term
examination, came out at the head of the list, with first honors and the Hodgson
prize for Greek. He finished his divinity career by being third on the list, close up
to the first honour list. He was ordained Deacon by Bishop Moorhouse, on May 27
1887, and was appointed to Rushworth, in the parochial district of the Campaspe,
then under the charge of the Rev. H. F. Tucker, the present incumbent of Christ
Church, South Yarra. He was ordained priest on Trinity Sunday, 1878, by Bishop
Moorhouse, and remained at Rushworth three years, during which period he laboured
with considerable success. After this, he accepted the incumbency of the parochial
district of Bright, rendered vacant by the sad and untimely death of the Rev. R. Bayne,
who was drowned in August, 1880. He remained at Bright for six years, and during
that period organised services throughout the outlying districts, eventually obtaining

the assistance of a reader for an important section of his large parish. The statistics
show gratifying signs of improvement in the parish during these six years, the number
of services for the year having increased from 212 to 414; of communicants, from 72
to 162; while the annual revenue rose from ,£326 to £452. Mr. Yeal, during his stay
at Bright, always took an active interest in the welfare of the district, and contributed
two or three series of popular articles of a semi-religious character to the Press in
that portion of the country. His labours were so much appreciated by the church
authorities that Dean Macartney was pleased to offer him, in July, 1886, the parochial
district of Bairnsdale, which he accepted, entering on the work in September. This
charge covers a vast area of about 20,000 square miles, to work which there are
already one curate and two licensed readers, with the immediate prospect of a second
curate. No time has been lost by Mr. Yeal in organising, for there are, at the present
time, regular services held in twenty principal centres, besides numerous small places.
This fact testifies to the activity of Mr. Yeal, and it would be almost superfluous to
add any words, by way of commendation, except that the preceding statements bear
out the truth of our opening observations.

HONOURABLE JOHN COX BRAY, M.L.A
Australia, unlike Victoria and Tasmania, was settled by a number of
enterprising gentlemen, who had formed themselves into an Association,
with the authority of the Imperial Legislature, for the colonisation of the
country, on the distinct understanding that it should not be a receptacle for criminals,
and that Great Britain would not be called upon to defray any portion of the expense
attending the attempt. It was, moreover, agreed that there should be no state church.
The first settlers landed in Holdfast Bay on December 28, 1836, and having shortly
afterwards settled the site of the future capital on the banks of the Torrens, gave to it
the name of the then queen, Adelaide. Were we writing a history of South Australia,
much could be said in its praise, for, although it has only passed its fiftieth year, it
can claim to possess some of the greatest undertakings of the present century —
to wit, its overland telegraph line—and, notwithstanding that it is passing through
an unexampled state of depression, yet there is, without a doubt, before that wonderful
colony, a bright and prosperous future. Its first colonists experienced the usual
vicissitudes incidental to young countries, but they were not disheartened, as they
were composed of men of no ordinary force of character; and it behoves those who
are now witnesses of, and participators in, the present stagnation, to follow the
example set them by the pioneers. South Australia is fortunate in possessing many
men of superior legislative and intellectual power, and in this respect she is second
to none in the colonies ; men who will, no doubt, by wise measures and concerted
actions, cause the colony to regain its former prosperity. Of those who possess the
ability to do so, the name of the Hon. John Cox Bray, Member of the House of
Assembly, representing the district of East Adelaide, and one of the best known
public men in South Australia, may be mentioned. Mr. Bray was born in Bundle
Street, Adelaide, in the year 1842, and was, for a considerable time, a pupil at St.
Peter’s College. Mr. Bray, in 1856, accompanied his parents to England, and was
for about two years a scholar at one of the educational establishments in Boulogne,
in France. Leaving school at the age of sixteen, he was, for about
four years, engaged in mercantile pursuits in the city of London, first as
an office boy in a shipbuilder’s office in Mark Lane, where he remained
for some two years, and next for the same length of time, as a clerk in
the office of a firm of West India merchants, in Crosby Square. The subject of our
sketch, however, was always looking forward to the time when he could return to his
native land, and, accordingly, before the end of the year 1862, we find him in Adelaide.


Some time after his return, Mr. Bray determined to enter the legal profession,
and was articled to the late Mr. T. B. Bruce, of the firm of Messrs. Stow and Bruce,
and admitted to the Bar in 1870. At the end of the year 1871, when, owing to
the political complications of the time, the Blyth Ministry obtained the Premier’s
consent to a dissolution of parliament, Mr. Bray was elected as member for the district
of East Adelaide, which he has continued to represent ever since.
In March, 1875, Mr. Bray was appointed Minister of Justice in the Blyth
Ministry, which was defeated on a no-confidence motion in June of that year. In
187(5, when the Boucaut Ministry was defeated, the Hon. Jas. Colton was called upon
to assume the reins of office, and he obtained the services of Mr. Bray as
Attorney-General, which position he held until the defeat of the Colton Ministry in
1877. After the retirement of this Ministry, Mr. Bray took a prominent part in all
debates of importance in the House of Assembly, and was appointed leader of the
Opposition. In the year 1880, when the Morgan Ministry failed in their attempt
to pass a measure for the establishment of County Courts on the extended
jurisdiction, Mr. Bray introduced, and carried through Parliament, a Bill extending
the jurisdiction of the Local Courts from TIOO to 4400, and conferring Insolvency
jurisdiction on certain of these courts. This measure has given very general
satisfaction. When the general election of 1881 was progressing, Sir William
Morgan, K.C.M.G., the then Premier, made overtures to Mr. Bray for the formation
of a Coalition Ministry, as a re-construction of the Ministry became necessary, in
consequence of two or three of its prominent members having retired. Mr. Bray,
however, declined the invitation, and shortly after the meeting of Parliament, in
June, 1881, the Morgan Government having resigned, he was called upon by His
Excellency Sir William Jervois to form a Ministry. Mr. Bray having succeeded,
his Ministry took office, he himself acting as Chief Secretary, the Hon. Lavington
Glyde as Treasurer, Mr. (now Sir J. W.) Downer, Q.C., as Attorney-General, the
Hon. J. G. Ramsay, M.L.C., as Commissioner of Public Works, Mr. A. Catt as
Commissioner of Crown Lands, and Mr. J. L. Parsons as Minister of Education.
This Ministry held office, without any change in its personnel, until March, 1884,
when Mr. Parsons was appointed Government Resident of the Northern Territory,
Mr. E. T. Smith, M.P., the present Mayor of Adelaide, succeeding him. At the
general elections, which took place shortly afterwards, the Hon. Lavington Glyde,
having failed to secure his re-election, retired from the Government, whereupon Mr.
Bray took the office of Treasurer, Mr. Ramsay acting as Chief Secretary, while Mr.
David Bower was appointed Commissioner of Public Works. In June, 1884, a
no-confidence motion having been carried in the House of Assembly, the Bray
Ministry resigned, after one of the longest terms of office held by any Government
in South Australia.
During their tenure of office, the sanction of Parliament was obtained
to the completion of the overland railway to Melbourne, and to the extension of
the Trans-continental line, while several most important public works were carried
out. At the end of the session of 1884, Mr. Bray arranged to pay a visit to England,
HONOURABLE JOHN COX BRAY, M.L.A.


and just prior to his departure was entertained at a public banquet in the Town Hall,
at which the Honourable Sir Henry Ayers, K.C.M.G., presided. A large number ol
members of both Houses of Parliament, and many well-known colonists were present,
and references of the most complimentary character were made to Mr. Brays
political career. He returned to South Australia in August, 1885. During his
absence from the colony the Colton Ministry had been defeated, and his old colleague,
Mr. (now Sir J. W.) Downer, Q.C., having been called upon to form a Ministry, Mr.
Bray was, in October, 1885, again induced to take the office of Chief Secretary.
In June, 1886, Mr. Newland, the Treasurer, having determined to retire from
office, Mr. Bray again resumed that position, which he held until June, 1887, when
the Downer Ministry resigned. He is a committeeman of the Old Colonists
Association, and one of the Board of Governors of St. Peter s College, and is a liberal
supporter of cricket and football clubs, and all manly sports. In all things tending
to increase the welfare of the community, the development of the country, and the
happiness of the people, Mr. Bray has ever interested himself, opposing nothing
that is consistent with common sense, or agreeable to the principles of equity
and justice.

HENRY EDMOND BREWER, M.D.
the several distinguished men in the numerous professions pursued in
9JH jK the colonies, it may be safely asserted that the medical faculty can point
to a long and brilliant array of practitioners. Although, nowadays, the
specialist is very much in demand, it must not be forgotten that a medical man,
especially in Australia, should possess that knowledge of the various branches of his
art which will enable him to successfully cope with almost every case that comes
under his notice. This is an essential requisite in one residing where there may not
be a doctor to be found at a distance nearer than twenty miles. Left to his own
resources, and debarred from the means of deliberating on a case with his brother
professional, he needs to exercise much caution and foresight; or it may be that he
is called out to a patient some ten miles off, about the nature of whose injuries or
disease he knows nothing until his arrival at the sick bedside, when the case, being a
very precarious one, demands instant attention. Without the necessary appliances or
instruments to give relief, he finds himself obliged to have recourse to many devices.
It is at such a crisis as this, that the ability and ingenuity of the physician are called
out much more than when he receives a patient in his consulting room. We doubt
not but that the subject of this sketch, who practises at Portland, has found himself
situated in the position described. Henry Edmond Brewer was born on August 28,
1820, at Bruges, Belgium, and is of English parentage. His father, Mr. Thomas
Gibson Brewer, was a Barrister-at-Law, but through the decease of his ancestor, who
left him considerable wealth, he was able to give up the practice of his profession at
the early age of 32, and went to reside on the Continent, where Henry Edmond was
born. The last mentioned had a varied experience, for at an early age, through his
family moving from place to place, he was enabled to receive tuition at the hands of
Belgian, French and German masters, whereby he was prepared to take his place
amongst the leading men of our time.
When seventeen he was sent to England to study medicine, &c., at the
University College and Hospital, London. He was most assiduous in his studies,
and eventually passed what, in those days, was considered a severe examination with
great credit at the Apothecaries’ Hall and the Royal College of Surgeons, England. At
this period there were not more than 120 physicians on the muster roll in England,
owing to the expense of qualifications and many other causes. Shortly after passing
he went abroad, seeking a field for his talents in Canada and the United States.
Disappointed in his quest, he returned to England, and took the position of surgeon


% — —rr 1
e 2 -—^
in the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, trading to the West Indies and Brazil.
At the time of the Russian war, when so many medical men were required, he
offered his services to the British Government, which were accepted, and he
remained in the transport “ Trent’ until the war was neaily concluded. In 180.1,
he accepted the position of surgeon on board the “ Blanche Moore, laden with
emigrants, and arrived in due time at Melbourne. Hearing that Portland was in
need of a medical man, and everything promising fairly, he selected this town as a
held for the employment of his talents, and at the present time is recognised as one
of the oldest residents of the district. He was early made a magistrate, and,
although he has not gone beyond a certain radius in his practice, he has had ample
opportunities of serving the public, being ever ready to attend to the various calls
made upon his time and service. During the greater portion ol his residence at
Portland he has had to bear nearly the whole onus of a medical man, save at
occasional times when others have come and left, finding more congenial
surroundings elsewhere. Dr. Brewer’s skill in surgery is great, and amongst
many cases that could be cited is one which will not readily be forgotten in the
annals of the colony. That which is alluded to was when the two sons of Andrew
Burns, through meddling with the cog wheels of a mill, were so fearfully mangled in
the hands as to necessitate in the one case the amputation of both arms above the
elbow, and in the other one arm above the elbow and one hand at the wrist. Both
of these boys, for whom the public felt such deep sympathy as to collect T3,300 to
assist them, are still living. Dr. Brewer is essentially a public man, he has been a
member of the Council for years, and has held the position of Mayor. Until Berry’s
Act became law he was coroner for the district. At present he is medical officer to
the Gaol, Benevolent Asylum, and Hospital, and several benefit societies. He
belongs to the Church of England, and, in 18G6, married Miss Harriet Underwood,
of Launceston, Tasmania, by whom he has one daughter.

REV, JAMES MEGAW.
Eev. J. Megaw is a descendant of the Yeoman farmers of the North of
Ireland. He was born in the County of Down in November, 1832. He
received his early education at a local high school, conducted by a Mr.
Irvin. From there he went to Queen’s College, Belfast, where he gained his
undergraduate education. After having passed “ the general certificate ” examination,
which is held to be equivalent to an ordinary University 8.A., he entered the General
Assembly’s Theological College, Belfast, where he received his theological training, and
was reckoned among the best students of his years. After receiving “ license ” from the
Belfast Presbytery in May, 1855, he went to Larne, where he was assistant for twelve
months to the Bev. Dr. Molyneaux. From there, at the call of the students, he went
to Connaught, where he took charge of the Clogher station as their missionary. Here
he was ordained to the office of the Holy Ministry in February, 1857. Through
a college companion, who had come to this colony, his attention was directed to it
early in 1858, and at the call of the Colonial Committee of the Irish Presbyterian
Church, he undertook to come here. He arrived in Melbourne in August of that
year by the good ship—a Black Ball Liner—“ Tornado,” Captain Crighton, after a
passage of three months. On arriving here, he allied himself with the then Synod
of Victoria, and was settled in October, in what was then known as the congregation
of South Melbourne. The church and grounds have since been sold ; they were at
the corner of Punt-road and High-street, Prahran, close to the Deaf and Dumb
Institution. Here he had gathered a considerable congregation, but after the union
of the different sections of Presbyterianism in 1859, feeling that the church was not
needed, and there being a lack of ministers, he accepted a call to Ararat, his present
congregation, and removed thither in June, 1800. At the time of Mr. Megaw’s
coming to Ararat, it was a mining centre, and the country around Crown lands,
occupied by squatters. Since then both town and district have undergone great
changes. The town has been nearly all rebuilt and grown larger, and the country
selected and become private property. The number of inhabitants in the district is
not much different now to what it was then, as, while there arc more farmers, there
are fewer miners. In 1805, and years succeeding, there was a great increase of
population, through the “ selections but the selectors, after a time selling to one
another, and then to the large landed proprietors, there are now but few people more
on the lands than prior to that period. The country around is mainly a large sheep
walk. The parish of Ararat is a very extensive one, embracing, with the Borough of


Ararat and other townships, an area of about 1,100 square miles. Divine service is
held at Ararat twice each Sunday, and once each month, and at some places oftener,
at thirteen places besides. This involves conducting twenty-two stated services every
month, and travelling amounting to one hundred miles a week, on an average.
There are live church buildings in the parish, and live Sabbath schools. There are
four elders in the session who render their minister valuable assistance. Mr. Megaw
was married, in 1857, to Susanna, third daughter of Henry Palmer, Esq.,
Drumminbeg House, Leitrim. She died at Ararat in April, 1872, and was buried in
the local cemetery. During Mr. Megaw’s ministry, the church at Ararat has been
enlarged and cemented, the manse almost rebuilt, and a paddock ol 40 acres
provided. All the other church buildings were erected during his time. His
predecessor in the ministry of Ararat was the Kev. W. Mclntosh, whose pastorate
lasted little more than a year. Besides the affairs of his own congregation, Mr. Megaw
has always taken a lively interest in the general matters of the town and district,
education, the hospital, Dorcas Society, Mechanics’ Institute, etc., and he has had the
honour of being twice president of the Hospital. Mr. Megaw has taken an active
part in the affairs of his Church throughout the district of the Wimmera. He is clerk
of the Wimmera Presbytery, and its oldest member, and has had a hand in founding
nearly all its congregations. As indicating how he stands with his brethren, and
the place he has in the denomination, he was called to the Moderator’s chair in
1879, and in 1884 was sent to represent the Church in the meeting of the General
Alliance of the Presbyterian churches, which was held in June of that year, in
Belfast, Ireland. The following extract from the minutes speaks for itself:—
“ It was therefore felt at the late Assembly that our Church should be well represented at the
next meeting of the Presbyterian Alliance; and, after consideration, it was resolved by general acclamation
that the Keverend James Megaw, of Ararat, should be commissioned to act as one of our deputies at
the coming Convention. This resolution was arrived at on such grounds as the following :
1. Several of the most respected ministers and adherents of our Church come from the North of
Ireland, and it was felt to be becoming on this occasion that an Ulster man should represent
us at a great meeting in the chief town of Presbyterian Ireland.
2. Mr. Megaw is an old colonist, having come to the colony in 1858.
8. He was a Minister of the Synod of Victoria at the date of the Union, and was present at the
consummation of that leading event in our history.
4. He is a faithful Minister of the New Testament.
5. He is a most laborious and acceptable pastor.
6. He is greatly respected by all classes in his own field.
7. He takes a deep interest in the spread of the Gospel, and in the extension of the Church beyond
his own immediate sphere, and especially in the interior of the colony.
8. He is much beloved by the brethren, and, as far as he is known, by the household of faith.
9. Without obtruding himself, he is diligent in the business department of the Church’s work. At
the date of the Union—twenty-four years ago—he was clerk of the Synod of Victoria, and he
has been clerk and chief agent of the extensive Presbytery of the Wimmera for many years.
10. In the year 1879 our Church unanimously elected him to the highest post of honour in her gift
the Moderatorship of her General Assembly.”

JOSEPH GOBLE.
agricultural resources of Australia are assuming an importance which
mill has the effect of attracting all eyes towards the prospects of our country.
v4i||i( l They are evidently destined to form a large part of the export trade in the
colony of Victoria. The production is increasing, and, consequently, the shipments
of grain are keeping pace therewith, as the wheat which has found its way into the
European markets compares very favourably with the wheat grown in England and
that exported from other countries. Attention, therefore, to the cereal productions
of this new country is indispensable. The soil in many parts, as well as the climate,
are specially adapted for the production of almost every description of grain, and
with the vast area now opened up and the great extent of country still awaiting
settlement, we may prophesy that the colonies will not only be able to supply all
colonial consumption, but have a large surplus for exportation. The land laws of
Victoria and the other colonies offer great inducements to the pursuit of agriculture,
and, such being the case, Australia is sure to become a great wheat-growing country.
In connection with this subject it would be well not to lose sight of an industry most
closely identified with that of wheat-growing—flour mills. While we may be able to
grow wheat and export it, we, nevertheless, claim that our grain should receive the
utmost care in the process of its being converted into flour. This can only be
secured by the employment of the best machinery, and the most capable millers,
one of whom is Mr. Joseph Goble. We know the old adage of his “ sable majesty ”
having sent the cooks, and we might apply the saying by changing a few words in the
case of inefficient workmen and employers. The success of Mr, Joseph Goble in
his business, however, shows plainly what can be achieved by intelligence and
industry. This gentleman was born at Benenden, Kent, England; his father was a
large farmer and miller, and, desiring to promote the interests of his son, spared no
expense in placing within his grasp all that would tend to give him a fair start in life.
Joseph, stimulated by the ambition to succeed, fell in with his father’s projects, and
early in life zealously devoted himself to the acquisition of knowledge.
To all appearance he was cast in the same mould as his grandfather, who
held the dignified position of a bishop in the Established Church of England, and
who, for conscience sake, together with many others at the time of the general
disruption, relinquished his high calling, and withdrew to Benenden, where he
purchased an estate, preferring in a new calling and place to outlive the past, and
start afresh in life. The subject of our sketch was placed at an early age under the
tuition of Mr. George Lansdall, of Benenden, who ably directed his studies. When


his education was completed, he returned to his father’s home, where lie picked up
the elements of milling. After a short time he was placed under the care of his
uncle James, and served a faithful apprenticeship until it had expired, when his
attention was directed to France, where the silk dressing of flour—at that time
unknown in Great Britain—was carried on. Being desirous of improving to the
utmost his knowledge, he was sent to Boulogne for twelve months, and having
during that period gained fresh experience, he returned to England, where he pursued
a course of study in mechanical engineering, chiefly at Enfield, remaining there for
three years. At the time of the Russian w 7 ar his attention was attracted to Australia,
but circumstances prevented a voyage thither. However, as soon as he felt free to
act for himself, he made arrangements to carry out his desire, and left the shores of
England on August 1, 1857, in the barque “ Champion,” arriving in Melbourne, after
a cruise of a little less than three months. Having taken a good look round, he
travelled to Beechworth, and hearing when there that a Mr. Ford was erecting a mill
at Wahgunyah, on the Murray river, he offered to lease it; but the owner declined.
Disappointed with the turn of affairs, he came back to Melbourne, arriving on
Christmas Day, where an engagement speedily awaited him at Mr. Ramsden’s mill,
in Elizabeth-street. Becoming known, he had numerous applications, and finally
took charge of a mill at Seymour—a position which gave him full scope for his
abilities. Preferring to be his own master, he eventually chose Belfast as a starting
point, and commenced business in January, 1859. Despite many difficulties, it
gradually increased, while others, less fortunate, failed, and retired to different
spheres. His present premises, the Port Fairy steam flour mills, cost the large sum
of <£4,000, the land and the wharf involving in addition the sum of £B,OOO. Lighters
can be moored alongside, and cargoes readily shipped, there being every convenience
for a large trade. In former days Mr. Goble shipped large consignments of flour to the
other colonies, and still sends cargoes to New South Wales. Some years ago he let
his business for a term, and retired to New Zealand, where he purchased an estate
situated some 35 miles from Auckland, which is supplied with an abundance of fish,
has pleasant scenery, with plenty of pheasants and other game. Under a capable
manager, he carries on an extensive business in breeding stock, and occasionally
pays his property a visit to see how matters are progressing. Notwithstanding
an extensive business and the cares attaching thereto, he has found time to identify
himself with public matters, and has been a member of the Borough Council for
some years, taking a leading part in the discussions respecting the progress of the
port, and the opening up of the river Moyne. He also, with a few others, made
arrangements for the purchase of the “ Casino,” which was the first steam vessel
to enter the river, and moor at the wharf. The undertaking was ably supported by
the public, and is now merged into the Belfast and Koroit Steam Navigation
Company. In all questions of public interest, Mr. Goble takes his share, and is a
living exponent of the principle that steady perseverance eventually crowns a man’s
efforts to succeed in life. He is a member of the Presbyterian body, and is regarded
as one of the most useful and devoted in that Church.

WILLIAM THOMSON.
(DOVSMBojp
ELF-MADE men are found in great numbers in Australia, and prominent
lalll among this class is William Thomson, of Hamilton. He is one of the
\ commercial pioneers of the district, to whom the valuable factors of
integrity, perseverance, and energy have been instrumental in assisting, not only his
personal fortunes, but the prosperity of the community.
Mr. William Thomson was born on the 29th February, 1836, at East Wemyss,
Fifeshire, Scotland. Flis father occupied a leading position in that town, following
the calling of a merchant. His attention, like that of many others, being attracted
to Australia, he made arrangements whereby he left his native land and sailed in the
barque “Yarra,” from the seaport of Leith, arriving in Hobson’s Bay in 1852. The
voyage was a long one, occupying six months. After a temporary stay in Melbourne,
he wended his way to the Bendigo diggings, but being unsuccessful, returned to
Melbourne, and took employment with John Ross and Co. Mr. Thomson, with his
brothers, bought John Ross and Co.’s branch business in Geelong, where they
remained for six years. About 1863, the business of Levy and Sanders, of Hamilton,
being in the market, was purchased by them, and its rapid increase led to Mr. Wm.
Thomson leaving Geelong in 1865. The original building was an imported iron
store, but after four years they were able to build a larger place of business. Mr.
Alexander Thomson, the elder brother, retired, business being carried on with an
uncle and younger brother. Ten years since, the present large structure was erected,
it being the largest building in Hamilton. The change enabled them to divide their
trade into different departments, one being devoted to drapery, etc., and the other to
general wares, greatly to the advantage of the general public. Their business is the
largest in the district and double that of any other firm. They have a branch at
Horsham, opened thirteen years ago, where a most extensive trade is done, and another
at Macarthur. These branches are under the supervision of capable managers, directed
from head-quarters. Associated in the business now is Mr. John Thomson, whose
business adaptability and courteous mien are of great service to the prosperity of the
firm. Mr. Wm. Thomson has taken an active part in all public matters affecting the
well-being of the community, and is always to the fore in all matters advancing the
direct prosperity of the district. He has been a member of the Borough Council for
many years, occupying the position of Mayor several times—at one period three years
in succession. He is connected with the Presbyterian Church, being an elder; he also
takes an active part in the well-being of the young; on Sunday he is to be found in the
Sunday School, of which he is the Superintendent. Amongst other offices held, he
is the Vice-President of the Hamilton Hospital and Benevolent Asylum. In 1872,
he married Miss Guthridge, daughter of the late Nehemiah Guthridge, Esq., of Sale,
Gippsland, by whom he has living, two sons and four daughters.


JAMES TUSON.
{J||SHAMES Tuson was born in 1830, at Woolton, near Liverpool, England.
H Being of an adventurous and active disposition he early sought the means
of advancing in life, and his attention being attracted to Australia, he made
arrangements to migrate thither. Finding that the prevalent idea existing was gold !
gold ! on his arrival in Melbourne, he made his way up country, and eventually
pitched his tent in Ararat, where he has now lived some 30 years. Some few months
afterwards he bought the Old Camp Hotel. After carrying on this business some time,
the principal hotel, closely adjacent, called the Bull and Mouth, was burnt down. At
this juncture, there being a great influx of settlers through extensive land sales, his
house was largely patronised, and the close attention paid to the wants of his guests
led to his name, as a successful caterer for the public, being largely known, thus laying
the foundation of his future success and fortune. Some 20 years ago, the present
Ararat Hotel was built by him; it contains 84 bedrooms, a large billiard room, and
complete modern appliances.
Mr. Tuson is considered the oldest identity in the district, and is a proved
public man, his advice being eagerly sought by the farmers and other residents ; he
has taken a keen interest in the advancement of Ararat, and is invariably one of the
first to advance its claims and push on its progress. He has been connected with
the Borough Council over 17 years, and occupied the position of Mayor upon more
than one occasion. His attention latterly has been directed to mining, and large
sums have been expended by him in prospecting and trying to develop different leads
in the district. This feeling has grown with his years, and it would be a happy
moment for him if, eventually, payable reefs were found in the locality. At the
present time he holds partnership rights in the “Grand Junction” and “Mitchell
Beef ” plant.
In the year 1886, he retired from business, and with his wife and one of his
daughters, took a trip to England in March, 1887, thus enjoying in their company
a most pleasant and happy season.
His union with a daughter of the Oliver family, well known at Woolton, has
been an excellent one, his wife having proved herself a true helpmeet and fond
mother. This lady, at his request, came out to Australia, and they were married in
Melbourne in 1858. He has five daughters, four of whom are settled in life; the eldest
is married to Florance Thompson, Esq., J.P., draper, one of the leading citizens of
Ararat, whose business premises form part of the basement of the Ararat Hotel. Mr.
Tuson is a member of the Church of England, and is highly respected throughout
the district as a pioneer and an honorable man.


HENRY BERESFORD HE LA POER WALL.
many it lias been surmised, and by some asserted, that the commercial activity
a coun try is an obstacle to its intellectual growth. This is partly true,
■tllppiil Men may become so engrossed in business, and the demand on their time
may be so great as to allow of very few leisure moments being allotted to the pursuit
of literary knowledge and mental culture. Besides, a commercial community holds
out to persons resident therein the prospects of amassing wealth which will yield at
an early period of life a competency sufficient to enable them to turn their attention
to intellectual subjects. But it is noteworthy that the mercantile character in a
community has always been found conducive to mental activity.
Indeed, it was this very character which led the Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish,
French, and English to engage so vigorously in search of new countries. Anxiety to
extend their influence, to obtain a larger area of territory, to secure a market for
their wares, to afford their fellow-countrymen fresh spheres of labour, or to acquire
possessions where mineral products would ensure an increase in wealth, urged each
of them to fit out expeditions designed for exploration, which resulted in the
accomplishment of these objects in a greater or lesser degree. Such were the
motives ; and motives are propelling powers. To achieve success in these enterprises
would awaken thought; to secure the best and most expeditious means of reaching
lands hitherto unknown would call forth invention and lead to the discovery of new
appliances. The scientific faculty would also require to be brought into play. Hence
mental activity would be increased. Contact with people whose institutions,
customs, laws, language, and religion differed from their own, would cause a new
system of administration to be employed. A comparison of the different modes of
government would result in an introduction of new laws, or an alteration or repeal of
those existing.
Intermingling with these strangers would produce new ideas, would modify
old ones, and dissipate some that were certain to become useless on account of
their impracticability. Commercial activity, therefore, encourages mental activity,
and gives an impetus to literature, science, and art, and these in their turn influence
communities of a mercantile spirit. But a still stronger proof that such a spirit is
not detrimental to the interests of moral (here is a new feature) and intellectual
culture, is afforded in the case of ancient Greece. In this instance, however, it was
her colonies in Asia Minor, where were the chief schools, that introduced and
disseminated learning in Europe ; and, humanly speaking, the rapid propagation of
Christianity was owing very much to the facilities afforded by commerce. The
shores of the Mediterranean were studded with communities devoted to trading


enterprise, and among them an incessant intercourse was kept up, which, under
Roman influence, assumed a great political importance. Such a state of things
must have been highly conducive to the growth of thought. On the other hand,
an agricultural community is a community of unpractical ideas and metaphysical
meanderings. A commercial community is a community of theory carried
into practice.
Victoria, although a colony of commerce, does not neglect the cultivation of
the finer faculties, for throughout the country are to be found several educational
institutions, of which not the least is the Hamilton and Western District College,
ably conducted by its present Head Master. Mr. Wall is the son of the late Rev.
Dr. Wall, of Heath House, in the Queen’s County, Ireland. Dr. Wall was the son
of His Excellency Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Wall and Lady Lrances, fourth daughter of
the last Earl of Seaforth, in the peerage of Scotland. On taking his degree, he was
appointed to a curacy in Ireland, and shortly afterwards succeeded to the head
mastership of Arlington school, situated in the ancient and picturesque town of
Portarlington. Here, in 1840, Henry Beresford de la Poer Wall was born, and
received his education under the immediate supervision of his father, who was
regarded as one of the soundest classical scholars of the day. After holding the
captaincy of Arlington for two years, he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
but subsequently transferred himself to the Dublin University, so as to be near his
mother (daughter of Captain Robert Morton and Lady Adelaide Berkeley), who at
that time became hopelessly invalided. Though so well grounded in classics that
senior students used to visit his rooms and those of his brother to listen to the
translations of the Greek and Latin poets, for which Dr. Wall was celebrated, he
nevertheless determined to devote himself to mathematics, since they present higher
attractions to minds of practical bias. After two years of distinguished success, Mr.
Wall complied with his father’s wish, and entered his name at the University School
of Engineering. This department of study had for him an unusual charm, and his
geological surveys in the coalfields of Wexford were, by a piece of good fortune, so
rich in new and striking fossils, that he was made a Eellow of the Royal Geological
Society before graduating. After taking a double degree, he remained for some
years at home, leisurely pursuing his favourite work, and having charge of the higher
form at Arlington in mathematics ; but, upon his mother’s death in 1866, having
heard of something likely to suit him in Australia, he determined to leave for Victoria.
Landing early in 1867, he found all things in a state of utter collapse in consequence
of the acrimonious dispute between the two houses of Parliament over the “ Darling
Grant.” Regular Government work could not be obtained, and casual work, if
procured, seemed to the new-comer to have no certainty of being paid for. Yet, not
caring to return to England without giving the colonies a fair trial, he accepted,
temporarily, a mastership at the Geelong college, and, after a few months, moved to
Ballarat, to occupy the position of Vice-Principal of Grenville College.
Here he married Miss Wingate, a fellow passenger from England, who has
ever since taken an active part in all his labours. During his stay in Ballarat, the


School of Mines was started, and he was a member of the Council of Founders, as
well as an occasional lecturer on subjects hearing upon Natural Science. He also
advocated at this time a system of education for large townships, whereby, for a very
moderate weekly payment, subsidised by a local rate, great central schools could be
established, in which not only a sound elementary education of a literary character
could he given, but also trades could be taught under the tuition of skilled workmen.
Upon the passing of the Act enforcing free, secular and compulsory education, he
abandoned his project, and has ever since been a strong supporter of the best elaborated
elementary system which the people of any age or country has enjoyed. When the
principal of Grenville College retired, Mr. Wall filled the vacancy for a short time, but
the occupation of a private schoolmaster was not congenial, and, accordingly, in 1871,
he became a candidate for the headmastership of the Hamilton and Western District
Proprietary College. He was duly elected as possessing the highest qualifications,
out of a large number of distinguished graduates of the English universities. The
college, as it then stood, was an unpretentious building, which the company thought
would prove large enough to satisfy all the requirements of the district, but it soon
became evident that the views of the proprietors were too modest. At a general
meeting which was called in 1873, the expenditure of £SOOO for the purpose of
erecting a new front was sanctioned. The grand pile of buildings was completed in
1874, and now there is no object more conspicuous in the Western District than the
college, which stands in twelve acres on the summit of a gradually-rising hill, and
is fronted by a finely-kept lawn and pleasure grounds. The interior of the building
is admirably suited for its purpose. All the rooms are lofty. The school-iooms
almost resemble large reception-rooms, and the bed-rooms are after the modern
fashion of cubicles for one or two boys. The dining-room is tastefully painted and
decorated, and the Hall of the Old Collegians is ornamented with a window of
stained glass, which was recently erected by former collegians to two of their
schoolmates who, after distinguished university and professional careers, have
passed away to the better world. No sooner were the new buildings completed than
they were filled. It is not surprising that among such a large number of students,
some were above average ability, but it is remarkable that so many should ha\e
distinguished themselves during so short a time at our own university, at
Edinburgh, and at Dublin, and in the legal and engineering professions. While this
must be, in a great measure, due to the brilliant parts of the students themselves,
there can be no doubt that the quick insight into character, and the accuiate gauge
of intellect possessed by the Warden, have combined to forward on the right path many
who would otherwise have wasted their talents and energies on uncongenial subjects.
Round these distinguished students are gathered others who have chosen pastoral or
commercial pursuits—the whole forming a society, which has a president, council,
and secretary, as well as a resident scholar at the College. In 1870, Mr. Wall,
having given offence to many by an effort, praiseworthy m itself, to prove practically
to boys that there is such a thing as sport, into which betting and gambling do not
enter, tendered his resignation to the directors. It was accepted after a delay of six

months. He then moved to Melbourne, and received the appointment of Lecturer
in Mathematics and a resident tutorship at Trinity College, University ol Melbourne.
After a few months he undertook the Natural Science also. As the lectures in Trinity
and in Ormond are delivered during the evening, he, in conjunction with one of his
most highly-esteemed pupils, purchased the good-will of the Alma-road Grammar
School. Its prosperity, and the care of resident students, compelled him to retire
from his lectureship at Trinity College in 1882, and devote himself once more to
schoolwork. During the years 1881 and 1884, he published the first and only
“ Physical Geography of Australia ” —a work rather difficult for the unaided student,
but of acknowledged value in the hands of a teacher well versed in the higher
treatises of physical subjects. This substantial contribution to Australian
educational literature has met with general approval, and it is to be hoped that
amidst onerous duties he will find time to write an enlarged treatise on the same or
a similar subject. While engaged in teaching at St. Kilda, evil days were
overtaking the Hamilton and Western District College ; and the directors in 1884
decided, as the Chairman in his speech at the annual distribution of prizes, 1880,
observed, that if they could again secure Mr. Wall’s services, its future prosperity
would be assured. Mr. Wall being deeply attached to the institution, which had
almost grown up around him, accepted the invitation, and entered on his second
incumbency in January, 1885. He brought with him his broadened views on the
subject of education, the newest methods of instruction, and the nucleus of a museum.
The last-named has been largely increased by public and private donations from all
parts of the colonies, and embraces within its ample compass specimens of geological,
zoological, and ethnological science. Since Mr. AYall’s return to the college, the
Government astronomer, Mr. R. L. J. Ellery, has gazetted it as a meteorological
observatory, and supplied the necessary instruments, similar to those in the Schools
of Mines at Ballarat and Sandhurst. With the aid of the senior boys, regular
observations are taken daily, and these, as well as any meteorological phenomena of
interest, are wired to the observatory on the St. Kilda-road, Melbourne. In addition
to his professional and University degrees, Mr. Wall is a Life Fellow of the Royal
Geological Society of Ireland; a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, England;
and holds the same distinguished position in the Royal Meteorological
Society, also of England. He is founder, Fellow, and, until recently,
a member of the Council of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, and
correspondent of the Meteorological Societies of Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, and
New York.

J. MARMADUKE ROSE, M.8., 0.M., M.P, J.P.
biography may fitly be commenced by asking the question what is a
representative man of Australia? The answer to the question depends upon
the consideration of what is the normal life of a colonial or colonist. It
is well known that life in the colonies differs very much from that which is experienced
or read of in European countries. And, again, life in the several colonies or
dependencies of the British Empire differs materially. In Lower Canada, the French
element in Montreal and Quebec mingling by intercourse and marriage with the
British element, has produced a disposition of character not frequently met with in
Australia. There is a grave and gay side to the man residing m those cities, and
there is a smartness or cuteness observable, which may be attributed to the proximity
of “Brother Jonathan.” Going West, more of the domestic life is to be encountered,
but differing very much from Australasian “home” life, and naturally so, as the
conditions are divergent; clear, bracing atmosphere, crisp snow, creating a buoyancy
of spirits and energy for work unknown in Australia. Again, m India, the life ol an
AnMo-Indian is unknown to any but those who have resided in that rich dependency
of Her Majesty. A white man in India is always helped by his own people, as it is
considered a disgrace to allow him to “ go to the dogs;” hence, we do not find any
but those obtaining appointments from home receive public notice, and those who are
down in the world are sent back as “ returned empties.” But m Australia it is
otherwise. A man here stands or falls on his own merits. He may start as a pauper and
end by being a prince—a very Saul in ability; for there are princes m literature, science,
and art, as well as princes in wealth, the church or the state. This is not written m
a radical spirit, it is written in harmony with the times, and as proof ol that, it is
sufficient to call the attention of the reader to the suggestion which has lately been
made, that an Order of the Bose should be founded for men of talent. .
A representative man of Australia is one, then, who, with little or no material
or social advantages, slowly advances himself to fame, not on other men s shoulders,
or by other men’s influence securing a position of responsibility and trust, but by an
honest and persevering course of conduct. It is a matter of every day knowledge,
however, that the successful man is an object of envy, lor envy is inspired by success
but the man who pursues his way conscientiously, neither looking to the right or left
in search of those who are unable or unwilling to gam a reputation, may m time gam
over his opponents and foes. .
The subject of this sketch is a gentleman who has distinguished himself m tne
noble profession of medicine, as his numerous testimonials amply illustrate, and the
lame practice which he commands corroborates. J. Marmaduke Bose is an Australian
native, having been born in Melbourne, on August 31st, 1849, a lew days alter ns


parents’ arrival in the colony. Both his parents, who are still living, are English by
birth, while his father is Scotch by descent, and appear to have transmitted the energetic
qualities which they possess to their offspring. His father became greatly reduced
in circumstances owing to the effects of an attack of what was then known as “ colonial
fever.” This circumstance was the laying of the foundation of that firmness and
self-reliance for which Mr. Kose is remarkable, and giving a steady impulse to that
general activity which he has displayed in various departments. Brought up to work
hard from his boyhood, in order to gain a livelihood, at the age of 16 he had learnt a
trade, earning at the rate of from T3 to T3 12s. per week, after paying two or three
boys about his own age, whom he had employed to assist him. Mr. Rose as a boy
can boast of far more thrilling adventures than usually fall to the lot of humanity.
To enumerate them, as they may be interesting to some of those young friends of ours,
who may scan these pages, we may mention that his first experience of the trials and
troubles of this world was, whilst a child, he was severely scalded on the face and
rendered blind for three days. The first real adventure he had was that of being lost
in the bush, wandering about in a most disconsolate manner, wondering what would
become of him. It would be difficult to say whether ahoy would feel more bewildered
on finding himself alone with no companions but the birds of the air or the beasts of
the field, than he would on looking wistfully about and scanning the face of every
passer-by in the city to discover some one who knew him, or some one with whose
identity he was familiar ; and yet this was the case of our young hero, for he was lost
in Melbourne.
When he was an Artilleryman he had experience of some things more serious
than befel him hitherto, and fortunately escaped death from a gun shot wound in the
arm and side, received during the camping out season at Sandridge. On another
he had his arm broken. Dr. Rose being obliged, when a boy, to earn his living by
the sweat of his brow, was unable to give that attention to his education which would
have equipped him with even an elementary knowledge, and feeling the great want of
such an acquisition he went to the Model School, Melbourne, paying the fees out of
what he had already saved from his earnings. His masters, Mr. White and Mr,
Jones, who are still living, paid great attention to his training, and as he was an apt
pupil, knowledge was so rapidly acquired that he soon passed for a pupil teacher.
At night he taught the Young Trader’s school, in Melbourne, and acquired a good
knowledge of human nature, as the majority of the scholars were very “ rough
diamonds,” belonging to the lowest classes in the back slums of Melbourne, many of
whom, however, have turned out well, and hold to-day important positions. Using
his hands by day to earn his livelihood, and his brains by night to impart as well as
acquire knowledge, in a short time he had progressed so rapidly that the examination
in Military Drill, Gymnastics, and Assistant Mastership was successfully passed.
Dr. Rose never failed in any examination, either at school, for the ministry, or at the
Edinburgh University, remembering what he had learned ever so quickly. There
are few who possess these two enviable virtues—celerity in grasping a subject and
the ability to retain it—which seem evenly balanced in him.


When a little boy he learned to recite, and at fourteen years of age delivered
an address on Missions before a large assembly of hearers, which gave great
satisfaction. So quickly did he spring upwards that at sixteen years of age he
preached his first sermon, and at nineteen he was invited by two different churches
to become their pastor.
Eventually, Dr. Rose settled at Williamstown, and during his three years’
ministration, worked so earnestly and indefatigably that he could not complain of
empty seats or a cold service, but rather was the opposite the case. He had large
congregations which appreciated his labours so much that, within this brief period,
a new church was built. In accordance with the rules of his church, which allows
her ministers to remain in one church no longer than three years, unless under very
special circumstances, he was removed to Mansfield ; but feeling aggrieved at the
treatment he received, and which he considered unjust, he resigned.
When a boy he was strongly pressed to stand before the footlights by Mr.
Knuckey, who was connected with Messrs. Spiers and Pond, of Railway
Refreshment fame, but his parents would not hear of it, and consequently he was
prevented from engaging in that calling which has for a great many such numerous
attractions. Possessing good elocutionary powers, having a strong inclination, and,
as is alleged, good ability for the vocation, he might have shone as brightly as any
star that ever glittered on the stage. After resigning the ministry, he returned to his
former profession of teaching, and became head master of the Yarraville State
School, After having given up the mastership, Dr. Rose went to Edinburgh, where
he studied for the medical profession, finally graduating with honours. Having-
gained a high reputation by his brilliant career in the University, he was not slow in
receiving some of the highest appointments usually sought after by young men, as
may be seen on referring to his testimonials, which speak eulogistically of his
knowledge of anatomy, physiology, surgery, medicines, pathology, and dentistry, on
each of which he lectured and prepared students for the diplomas of London,
Edinburgh, and Glasgow Universities, over a thousand who are now doctors having-
been his pupils. Whilst occupying the position of head resident surgeon in the
Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, under the Surgeon-in-Ordinary to Her Majesty the
Queen in Scotland, he contracted blood-poisoning at a post-mortem examination, and
from the results of which he has never thoroughly recovered. After being confined
to bed for some months, he was obliged to take a voyage to Melbourne, where he
became so ill that he was compelled to take a nurse with him on the return voyage to
Edinburgh. In that city his health was so indifferent that months were spent in an
endeavour to regain it, and, at length, there being no signs of recovery, he was unable
to accept the offer of a partnership in a first-class West End practice, London. Dr.
Rose afterwards took another voyage to Melbourne, with the hope that the trip would
improve his health ; but when he landed in February, 1882, although somewhat
better, yet his health was anything but robust. He settled in Williamstown,
and his ability soon secured for him a good practice. It is rather a
strange coincidence that in both professional capacities minister and


doctor liis first field should be in the same town. After remaining in
Williamstown for twelve months, he removed to Melbourne.
In February, 1883, he was elected as representative for North Melbourne in
the Legislative Assembly by a large majority, but his resignation as Public
Vaccinator not having been received by the O’Loghlen Government, the legality of
his election was disputed. In order to save any unpleasantness that might arise
over the discussion of the point, he only sat in Parliament one day, and then
resigned, but was re-elected without opposition. Shortly afterwards he was aj)pointed
a member of the Central Board of Health for Victoria, and has manifested a great
deal of interest in the duties connected with this body, working most actively and
energetically.
Dr. Rose next received commission as a magistrate. His early days having
brought him so much in contact with young men, he is naturally led to take a deep
interest in all that affects their moral and mental improvement. Knowing well the
temptations to which they are exposed in a large city like Melbourne, his efforts have
constantly been directed towards doing all he can possibly achieve to afford them
entertaining and instructive amusement in their leisure hours. This is one, and
perhaps the principal reason, why, with his multifarious duties, he acts asPresidentof the
Victorian Improvement Societies’ Union, to which post he was elected at its initiation.
This is a large and influential body of literary young men, many of whom hold very
responsible positions in different departments of the commercial world. Being an
Australian native, he is naturally led to further in every way whatsoever has a tendency
to benefit his fellow colonials, and accordingly we know him as the founder and President
of the Australian Natives’ Building Society. There is no more noble work than that
of stimulating young men to take an interest in their country, as it engenders in them
a spirit of patriotism, and calls forth from their ranks men fitted to shape the
destinies of their native land, by their experience, their knowledge, and their
disinterested motives. In addition to the above position which Doctor Rose now
holds, he has been director and president of several companies. He has at the
present time one of the largest and most lucrative consulting practices in Melbourne,
which is daily increasing and encroaching on his time, which, together with
frequent attacks of ill health (twice he had congestion of the brain, occasioned by
overwork and a heavy practice), have prevented him from paying more attention to
political and social questions.
As a member of the Legislative Assembly he has introduced into Parliament
the following measures: —The Registration of Dentists Bill, the Boiler Explosion
Bill, and a Bill to Legalise Eight Hours. After his first election, he had the honour
to be selected by the Service-Berry Government to move the address in reply to the
Governor’s speech.
Dr. Rose has always been most popular and successful both as a lecturer and
preacher, and has made such advances in elocution that he was enabled, while in
Edinburgh, to teach that most useful art.

advantages which a volume of this nature possesses are numerous and
mm varied. To those who cannot command much leisure time, it should
prove particularly useful and instructive, as it compresses into a small
space the facts of a life, and yet it neither mutilates nor omits what is deemed
essential to the completeness of the pen-picture. A publication of this description
can be taken up at stray moments, and is designed to cultivate a habit of enquiry, as
well as to contain a fund of information, presenting to the reader, in a new dress,
accounts of many persons, some of whom, doubtless, are known to him. Moreover,
it serves to recall incidents of a personal nature not herein mentioned, and to renew
the acquaintance of friends whom time and distance have more or less obliterated
from the memory. It is a library of biographies ;itis a kaleidoscopic view of men ;
it is a moving panorama of events; it is cosmopolitan, since it is democratic and
aristocratic, plebeian and patrician. It relates the lives of village Hampdens and
mute Miltons; of heroes whose courage has not been called forth by the presence of
comrades to cheer them on, or by the reflection that their acts will be proclaimed
on the house-top. It frequently happens that the knowledge of this fact urges men
to the performance of deeds which would otherwise not be attempted. Excitement
and enthusiasm effect much; but when none of these agencies are at work—when,
comparatively speaking, a man has little to live for; when he finds himself utterly
defeated ; when his youth and vigour are gone, and he feels that old age is slowly
creeping on, and that, at best, there are but a few years allotted to him—in such a
case, to rise up and make a strenuous effort to overcome all obstacles and regain his
lost position —in short, to turn defeat into victory—this is ennobling, and those who
read of it years afterwards receive inspiration therefrom. It is remarkable that
deeds chronicled at the time of their performance, no matter how striking, are
frequently lost sight of; whereas, if recorded years afterwards, they are sure to survive
the decay which ages bring about. As the oak is fertilised by the leaves which it
casts, so the man is improved by the mistakes he has made, or the calamities he has
sustained. All things work for good to the man who is good, whereas all things
work for bad to the man who is evil. A portion of the foregoing observations will be
found, later on, to have some reference to Mr. Thomas Must, of Prospect, Portland,
Victoria, the only son of Thomas and Mary Must. He was born in London, January
30th, 1815. His parents belonged to Sudbury, in the County of Suffolk, and came
to London in the hope of improving their prospects, but were doomed to suffer
disappointment. He was educated at a local school, and at the eaily age of fouitecn
was engaged with a Mr. Thomas Botwright, collector of taxes. He did not, however,


continue long in this employment, as lie was anxious to secure an independency, of
which he saw very little prospect at home; and conceiving that Australia was a good
field, he determined on immigrating to this country. Accordingly, at the age of
seventeen, he sailed on August Bth, 1832, in the barque “ Guardian,” 203 tons register,
Captain Sinclair, and arrived (after a detention of some few days at the Cape ot
Good Hope) at Sydney in January, 1833, bringing a letter of introduction to the
late Richard Jones, an eminent merchant in those days. Captain Sinclair brought
him under the notice of the then well-known firm of Marsden and Flower, general
merchants and shipping agents, to whom the “Guardian ” had been consigned. They
were so favourably impressed with the young lad that they straightway engaged him,
and gave him the position of storekeeper and junior clerk. In this post, every
opportunity was afforded him of becoming thoroughly conversant with the usages of
business and the value of goods. The intelligence he displayed in the discharge of
his duties and the interest he evinced in his employers’ prosperity, combined with
his sterling integrity, were so much appreciated by them, that they sent him
frequently to the interior of New South Wales as their representative, and on one
occasion to South Australia to attend to most important matters connected with the
firm’s business, which he conducted so ably as to give entire satisfaction. On Mr.
Marsden’s death, he remained in the employment of Mr. Philip W. Flower, the
surviving partner, and with the new firm of Flower, Salting and Co., until May, 1846,
when it was suggested that he might take a trip to Melbourne and the other Western
ports, which were then springing into business existence. He travelled by steamer
to Melbourne, thence overland to Geelong, Lady Bay, and Portland, and returned by
the schooner “Lowestoft” to Sydney. After consultation with the two senior
members of the firm, Messrs. Flower and Salting, it was resolved to open business
at Portland, which, in Mr. Must’s opinion, was one of the most promising places he
had visited in Victoria. He agreed to the proposal that Mr. Horace Flower, who
had lately arrived, should be his partner; and the brig “ Essington,” Captain Mills,
was immediately chartered to carry the merchandise to Portland. The firm
commenced business towards the end of August, 1846, under the style of Flower and
Must, with a capital of <£2,000, and credit to make advances to settlers, on wool and
produce, for a considerable amount. The business continued with more or less
success for five years, when it was proposed that his partner, Mr. Flower, should join
his brother-in-law, Mr. William Rutledge, at Port Fairy.
An arrangement was made whereby Mr. Flower should receive his half share
for the remaining two years, a certain sum, covering the loss of his services, to be
allowed as an equivalent for a clerk in his place. At the expiration of seven years, the
firm of Flower and Must was dissolved by effluxion of time, Mr. Must buying out
Mr. Flower, and henceforth conducting the business in his own name for twenty-three
years. He opened a branch at Port MacDonnell, South Australia, and had also an
establishment in Auckland, New Zealand, conducted by a relative as resident
managing partner, with a large amount of capital at his command. For some time
the latter business showed every prospect of being highly remunerative; but, flushed
THOMAS MUST.


with excitement and the elements of success, his partner began to invest in Maori
lands and other ventures alien to a mercantile concern, with the result that Mr.
Must was summarily called upon by a certain banking institution, and other
correspondents in London and New York, to make arrangements for their overdraft.
By the discharge of these liabilities he realised a loss of many thousand pounds. He
was largely interested in squatting and station properties, but the Land Acts of 1862
and 1865, particularly the latter, injured him and many others to a very serious
extent. The whole of the Crown lands, in some two or three instances, being
thrown open for selection, thousands of sheep and cattle were scattered to the winds,
while the disease introduced into the stock rendered the catastrophe complete.
Although he was ruined by losses, amounting to upwards of T60,000, incurred
through the failure of the Auckland concern and the alienation of his squatting
properties, he was determined not to be crushed out of existence, but, rising again,
made a fresh effort to beat back the waves of adversity, and continued in business
till June 30, 1876.
Being then upwards of sixty years of age, and finding that he had sufficient
real and personal property to ensure him a moderate income, he arranged with his
old and faithful manager, Mr. P. W. Shevill, to succeed him. On August 25th,
1842, he married Anne, the eldest daughter of Mr. T. T. Wilcox, the ceremony being
performed by the Rev. Robert Allwood, at St. James’ Church, Sydney.
His family consists of eight daughters and four sons, all of whom are living
at the present time, five of the former being married. On May 20th, 1856, he received
a letter from J. H. Kay, Esq., Private Secretary to His Excellency Major-Gfeneral
Macarthur, enquiring if he would permit his name to be added to the list of
Territorial Magistrates for the colony. He consented, and held this position till the
new Act came into operation, when he was gazetted as a Magistrate for the Western
Bailiwick. On February 12th, 1862, an application was received by him from the
Chief Secretary, requesting him to undertake the office of Visiting Justice to the
gaol of Portland, which he also accepted, and held till November 9th, 1872, when ho
applied to be relieved of the duty, as it was his intention to visit the adjoining
colonies and New Zealand, necessitating an absence for some time. In February,
1856, he was the first Chairman appointed for the Municipal Borough of Portland,
and in 1864 held the second Mayoralty.
He was a member of the Borough Council at various times up till August,
1871, when he received a special letter of thanks for his long and attentive discharge
of public duties. Mr. Must was, in addition to the numerous positions he occupied,
a member for some years of the Road Board, afterwards of the Shire Council, and
acted as Returning Officer from July 4th, 1856, until October 9th, 1872.
He received, on March 20th, 1867, a Commission for the Consent to the
Marriage of Minors, from the Chief Justice, Sir William F. Stawell; and other public
matters of less importance were entrusted to his care. It is not too bold to assert
that there are few English-Australians who can show a longer catalogue of public
appointments than the preceding, which of itself speaks volumes, as it testifies to

the sterling worth of Mr. Must as a citizen anxious to further the interests of a town
with which he has been so long and intimately connected. It shows, moreover, that
a man, when living for others and labouring for their welfare, also lives and labours
for himself, since he gains the esteem and respect of his countrymen by what may be
termed the faithful discharge of patriotic duty. On a requisition from the electors of
Portland in May, 1873, Mr. Must was nominated for a seat in the Legislative
Assembly, in room of the Hon. Howard Spensley, who resigned ; and was returned by a
majority of eight over his opponent, Mr. Edward F. Hughes ; taking his seat,
on May 27th, on the cross benches on the Government side.
On February 10th, 1874, he was again presented with a requisition asking
him to be nominated a second time for Portland, at the ensuing General Election. He
consented, and was returned, on April 22nd, 1874, by a majority of one hundred and
eleven votes over the other candidate, Mr. Edward F. Hughes, and retained his seat
until the dissolution in December, 1876 ; thus representing the Electoral District of
Portland for some three and a half years. After this, the new Electoral Act which
came into operation had the effect of including a much larger area of country than
hitherto, the greater portion of it having been represented for many years by
Mr. Thomas Cope. Under these circumstances he did not consider it advisable
or consistent to oppose this gentleman, and accordingly retired from the
Parliamentary arena.
It is almost superfluous to add anything by way of conclusion, as the career
which has been sketched is one of the most remarkable in the volume—remarkable
for courage in the midst of danger, tranquility when beset by trials, hope when
everything looked dismal and threatening, and perseverance and brains to retrieve
lost ground.
THOMAS MUST.


H. BYRON MOORE.
4|||N the 21st of November, 1877, the additional estimates, including a sum of
||il <£18,025 for payment of members, were laid upon the table of the Victorian
Legislative Assembly. On the sth of December a Bill for continuing
payment of members until the close of the Parliamentary Session was read a third
time in the Lower House; on the 11th of that month its second reading was negatived
by a large majority in the Legislative Council; on the 14th Mr. (now Sir) Graham Berry
delivered his ever to be remembered speech at Beechworth about “the Melbourne
Club and dirty work;” on the 20th the Council laid aside the Appropriation Bill
without a division; and on the same evening the Chief Secretary (Mr. Berry)
delivered an intemperate harangue in the Assembly, in which he characterised the
act of the other branch of the Legislature as that of madmen, and expressed his
opinion that coercion should be had recourse to, in the same manner as lunatics were
coerced and relegated to an asylum for the insane. Such was the attitude of the
Houses towards each other in January, 1878. On the 7th of January of that year a
meeting of the Cabinet was held, at which all the members of the Government were
present. In discussing the political situation, some steps were taken towards the
removal of several heads of departments in the civil service, with a view, it was stated,
to substantial reduction. On a plea of economy, it was decided to get rid of four
gentlemen to begin with, who had been for a lengthened period in the public service,
and each of whom had occupied a high position with credit to himself and benefit to
the country. Each had the reputation of having discharged the onerous duties that
devolved upon him with ability, fidelity, and unblemished integrity. Each was
justified in considering his appointment a permanent one, and had of course laid out
his life accordingly.
The passing of the Civil Service Act ostensibly was for the purpose of securing
that the administration of public affairs should be conducted by a body of officials of
the highest attainable capacity and merit, and that this body should have a fixity of
tenure during good conduct.
One of these four of whom we have been writing is the subject of this
memoir. Following the decision in regard to the four in question, a complete
suspension in the administration of justice took place by the removal of all Judges,
save the Supreme Court ones, who could not be removed. Upwards of fifty officers


in the department of Crown Lands and Survey were cashiered, twenty-four from the
Department of Mines, the engineering clerk and the assistant engineer of the
Victorian Water Supply, the Admiralty surveyor and his assistants, the collector of
Customs, and hundreds of minor officials. Such was the commencement of the
demoralisation of the public service of the colony in the beginning of 1878, owing
to the Legislative Council having resisted a gross and unjustifiable assault upon its
constitutional rights and privileges ; and because a conflict had arisen between the two
Chambers upon a point which the country had had no opportunity of discussing and
for the ascertaining of opinion, on which Mr. Berry should have asked for dissolution,
and permitted the constituents to record their sense on the question at issue. Henry
Byron Moore —the son of Frederick Farmer Moore, the late head of the Victorian
Government Store Department, who was favorably known in his day, both in scientific
and literary circles —was born on the 11th of February, 1839. The father of our
subject was a member of the company that introduced gutta-percha into England as
an article of commerce. Mr. Byron Moore, who landed in Victoria in 1852, had
shewn a predilection for chemistry and printing, and this bent was in a great
measure fostered by the father, who afforded his sons the advantages of a printing
press and a laboratory at home.
In October, 1853, on a letter of recommendation from Sir Andrew Clarke to
Colonel Latrobe, Mr. Moore was appointed by the latter, who was then in charge of
Port Phillip, as field clerk and draughtsman in the District Survey Office at Geelong.
We have already had occasion to refer to the onerous duties in this district in the
biography of Mr. Skene, and it will suffice to say that Mr. Moore rendered very
material aid to that gentleman. On the removal, in 1861, of Mr. Skene, the District
Surveyor, to Melbourne, Mr. Moore was appointed to the vacant position, and worked so
assiduously that his health was endangered. His condition necessitated a retirement
from active duty, and he accordingly obtained leave and proceeded to England, where
he spent a year in recruiting his health. While on leave, he was elected a member
of the Royal Geographical Society of England, on the motion of Mr. John
Arrowsmith, seconded by Admiral Collinson. He returned to Melbourne in May,
1863, when Mr. Ligar, who was then Surveyor-General, induced him to devote his
attention to photo-lithography in the Lands Department. A studious application to
this enabled him, during the next three years, to render very great service to the
colony, in the execution of maps and plans. In 1865 he was deputed to the special
work of initiating Mr. Grant’s Amending Land Act, a work which necessitated his
travelling throughout the colony, and which taxed his physical capabilities to the
utmost. Mr. Moore, in recognition of the services he had rendered, was appointed
Assistant Surveyor-General in 1870; and such was the reputation he had established
that, in 1874, he was requested and deputed by the then Minister for Lands, Mr. J.
J. Casey, to reorganise the Survey and Lands Department. He accepted the task,
and commenced by organising the occupation branch of the Lands Department, and
dividing the work into territorial divisions at head quarters. He worked unceasingly,
H. BYRON MOORE.


and, on the 31st of December, had the gratification of perfecting his programme.
A few days after, however, he found himself one of the victims of “ Black
Wednesday.” Immediately on its becoming known that Mr. Moore had left the
service of the Victorian Government, handsome offers from the sister colonies were
made him; but he steadfastly declined, and determined to preclude the possibility, in
the future, of being the shuttlecock of politicians, by starting in business on his own
account. His first essay in this direction was the business of Surveyor and Financial
Agent. After a short career in his newly-chosen line, he suggested the idea of an
Exchange, and meeting with a congenial spirit who helped him much, erected the
building in Gollins-street, known as The Exchange. This commercial enterprise of
his alone deservedly secures him a page in the history of Victoria. Possessing a
knowledge of the merchants’ exchanges throughout the colonies, as well as of those
throughout the United States, Mr. Moore, in planning out the Melbourne Exchange,
brought all his experience to bear in putting an institution at the command of the
public which facilitates almost every description of business. The building was erected
by the enterprise of Mr. R. J. Jeffray, of the firm of Win. Sloane and Co., at a cost of
more than T20,000, upon the earnest suggestion of Mr. H. Byron Moore, who, on its
completion, became the lessee. The situation of the Exchange is all that could be
desired, being within easy access of all the principal business places. An idea of the
advantages of this institution can be formed from the fact that a merchant, “provided
he did not want absolute cubic space for the depositing of his merchandise during
the period which intervenes between purchase and sale, could, to all intents and
purposes, conduct his business from the public room of The Exchange.” In order to
meet the large expenditure necessitated by the multifarious departments in The
Exchange, Mr. Moore has had to adopt certain costly measures to induce every
merchant and business man to become a subscriber. By contributing to the general
convenience and comfort of the public, and furnishing them with the most reliable
information from all parts of the world, he holds out an inducement which cannot
well be resisted. The celerity with which telegraphic communication, intercolonial
and foreign, is received is astounding, and commends itself highly. A limited
description of the building would be quite d propos here: —Entering the main hall,
one finds himself in a handsomely decorated chamber, well lighted, large, and lofty.
The wall passing round the room from the left is divided into archways, each of
which is devoted to a colony. Within each space of such archways are distributed
the leading journals of the colony which it represents. Further on is a handsome
mahogany table, devoted exclusively to the members of the Press. Facing this are
rich mahogany desks, with lock and key drawers, for the accommodation of those who
might choose to become owners, pro tom. Weather reports from all parts of the
colonies occupy a space in the next pillar, and ships’ manifests of their full cargo,
which are posted immediately the vessels are telegraphed off Cape Otway, decorate
the one further on. Information regarding railway goods traffic, and travelling stock
from all points, is daily posted up. The visitor now sees in front of him a number of

tables covered with English, Indian, foreign, and American papers, and then comes
a counter containing shipping registers. The next hall opening from the main one
is used as a Cora Exchange. A well furnished billiard room, suites of rooms for
every conceivable use, lavatories, bath rooms, and a luncheon room, furnish all the
requisites desirable.
The Telephone Exchange, founded by Mr. Moore in conjunction with Messrs.
Masters and Draper, is one of the principal recommendations to the use of the
institution. It is worthy of note that the telephone system was introduced into
Melbourne by Mr. Moore long prior to its having come into use in London. As far
back as in 1877 Mr. Moore reticulated the Government offices.
His connection with the lighting up of the Eastern Market with electric light
is generally known, as is the fact of his initiating the distribution of wool circulars
throughout the world. Taking into consideration the boon he has conferred on
Victoria, it is not to be regretted that he was made a victim to that indefensible tyranny
which is now known as Black Wednesday.

JAMES STIRLING, F.G.S., F.L.S., &c.
Stirling was bom at Geelong on January 9, 1852. He is the eldest
rll| H son of the late Mr. Peter Stirling, merchant and member of the Town
Counci]. He received his education partly at St. Paul’s School, Ashby,
and partly at the National Grammar School, until fourteen years of age. During his
school career, and at the annual competitive examinations then held at Geelong,
Mr, Stirling was the recipient of numerous prizes for proficiency. The original
intention was to have given him a first-class commercial education, and afterwards the
usual University course; but this was frustrated by his father’s death, as Mrs. Stirling,
who was left with six children and limited resources, was reluctantly compelled to
withdraw her son from the benefits of further scholastic instruction, in order to pay
for the education of the remaining members of the family. As a means of gaining a
livelihood, Mr. Stirling was thereupon taken by an uncle, who owned squatting estates
in Gippsland, to learn station management. Two years’ experience of station life in
the then wilds of the Snowy River, with the adventures peculiar to such a calling,
one of which was the dislocation of his right shoulder while madly attempting to
arrest the progress of a wild bull, seems to have convinced young Stirling that, with
the exception of learning the art of cattle gathering, branding, horse breaking, and
also acquiring a knowledge of some aboriginal language (Kurnai), together with the
exciting pleasure of running down kangaroos and emus, he was not advancing but
rapidly retrograding in knowledge—a fact by no means congenial to his aspirations.
As he was desirous of obtaining different employment, his uncle, T. T. Stirling, J.P.,
procured for him a position as mail rider to convey Her Majesty’s mails from
Bruthen to Bendock, a somewhat perilous undertaking in those days when
bushranging was rife, and the danger of floods and storms in the mountains very
great. After several narrow escapes, such as nearly being frozen to death by having
been caught in a snow storm, and compelled to remain out all night in the snow on
Woolgulmerang plateau, and on another occasion experiencing a narrow escape from
death by drowning in the attempt to swim the horse and mails over the river when
flooded, as well as finding the employment unsuited to his tastes, he resolved to write
to his mother, and solicit her assistance in obtaining an opening for him in some
useful trade or profession.


Having a strong desire to become a sculptor, his mother soon placed him
under the charge of a friend, who was a monumental mason —the late Mr. Teggatt.
He was informed that he must engage in some hard work for a year or two, begin at
the bottom of the ladder and work up ; and with this in view he was placed at the
Alfred Graving Dock, then in course of construction, to learn the interesting art of
punching bluestone.
Surrounded by about sixty masons, young Stirling’s first efforts (as he
has informed the writer) were more successful in knocking skin from his left
hand than bluestone chips from his “ banker.” With a lacerated left hand and a
blistered right one, young Stirling seems to have stuck to his work with commendable
determination, and was not long before he could hew rough ashlar, when he was
rewarded with weekly wages at the rate of 6s. per diem. Conscious of the great
strain his apprenticeship was on his widowed mother’s slender resources, young
Stirling was now enabled to pay for his board, and occasionally took a little money
home to help on the education of his brother and sisters. During this time he was a
regular attendant at the newly-organised School of Design at the old Trades’ Hall,
in Lygon-street, while his other evenings were devoted to architectural studies. As he
has remarked to the writer,“ Little did they think at that time that the geologic cavities,
so troublesome to the mason when working bluestone, would afterwards afford him so
much food for thought, from a geologist’s point of view, or that his subsequent life
studies would follow so closely in the lines of that master of geology, the illustrious
Scotch mason-geologist, whose name is familiar to all scientists—Hugh Miller,
the leader among geologists in the home of his ancestors.” A strike occurring in
the works at the Alfred Graving Dock, and his employer having obtained the
contract for the first section of the North-Eastern Railway, Mr. Stirling was sent to
work on the North-Eastern Railway at Essendon as junior mason, at the rate of
7s. 6d. per diem. He appears to have been occasionally employed in duplicating
drawings, and as he was frequently left in charge during the foreman’s absence, he
by these means soon acquired such useful knowledge that he was at last in receipt of
ten shillings per diem (journeyman’s wages), being then just nineteen years of
He was on the point of entering a monumental mason’s yard to learn a higher
branch, viz., carving, when, being suddenly seized with lung disease, through
inhaling stone dust, he was compelled to abandon all hope of becoming a sculptor,
his medical adviser having recommended a complete change of employment.
Thrown on the world again, he determined not to remain idle, but if possible
to utilise his knowledge of masonry by obtaining employment, even at a small wage,
in an architect’s office.
He was soon engaged by a firm of architects in Geelong as junior draughtsman,
and shortly afterwards, when the Lands Department was advertising for draughtsmen,
he applied to the late Surveyor-General, A. S. Skene, M.A., and after a preliminary
examination, was appointed. This was in 1873, when he was twenty-one years old.
Mr. Stirling kept steadily pursuing his studies, and might have been seen in the
JAMES STIRLING, F.G.S., F.L.S., &c.


Melbourne Public Library any clay after office hours, between 4 and 5.30. p.m., and
frequently in the evening. Within two years he was selected to accompany the
District Survey party to Omeo, in the capacity of foreman and draughtsman.
While engaged in assisting in the secondary triangulation of the district, his first
attention was drawn to field geology by the enthusiasm and advice of a gentleman,
who may be said to have exercised, by his suggestions, the turning point in Mr.
Stirling’s career.
This gentleman—Mr. A. W. Howitt, P.M., F.G.S., the illustrious discoverer of
Burke and Wills’s remains, and a talented petrographist, ethnologist, and explorer—
counselled Mr. Stirling to begin the study of geology, as there were splendid
opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of the science by a careful examination of
the rocks of the Australian Alps, and kindly volunteered his assistance whenever his
official duties as Police Magistrate led him to Omeo. From this time Mr. Stirling’s
geological studies appear to have been continuous, and the communications to
scientific societies and journals, as well as present official position, are the record of his
success. When beginning the study of geology, he seems to have been impressed with
the great task before him, and finding that it was inseparably allied with chemistry,
botany, and meteorology, determined to gradually extend his studies to these sciences.
Through the kindness of Mr. Ellery, the Government astronomer, some meteorological
instruments were obtained, and supplementing these with others of his own
construction, he was enabled in 1885 to write a pamphlet on the meteorology of the
Australian Alps, which has been published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of
Victoria, and republished in English scientific journals. After some two years of
field work, his services were required in the office as clerk and draughtsman, in
consequence of the great and rapid increase in the administrative work of the Survey
Office, connected with selections under the Land Act of 1869. During the time he was
engaged in field work he formed the acquaintance of an amiable young lady,
who was governess in one of the adjoining stations, and finding their
tastes and literary sympathies to be in accord, were married in 1876. As
the result of this union, Mr. Stirling attributes a great deal of the scientific
work he has been able to accomplish to his wife’s common sense and womanly
forethought, encouraging his studies, and, by considerable self-sacrifice, enabling
him to acquire the necessary books and scientific appliances for further study.
Having at an early period commenced the study of the native vegetation of
the Australian Alps, his work was brought under the notice of the Government
botanist, Baron Yon Mueller, who, having encouraged him to collect, assisted him by
naming the species of plants collected, and became an instructive correspondent and
warm friend ; indeed, to the talented Baron’s assistance, Mr. Stirling ascribes much
of his success as a writer on native vegetation. The following extract from a letter
sent by the Baron to Mr. Stirling on his election as Vice-president of the Geological
Society of Australia, speaks volumes for the estimation in which he is held by that
illustrious and now venerable man: —“ It is an auspicious event to the Geological
JAMES STIRLING, F.G.S., E.L.S., &c.


“ Society of Victoria that you have accepted one of its vice-presidencies, because
“ your special and extensive acquaintance with the geology of the Australian Alps
“ will also now be brought to bear for the benefit of the Society on further elucidations
“ in the same direction—while your new position in the Geologic Survey will open
“ for you also elsewhere wide fields for new researches, in which you are sure to
“ engage with the same enthusiastic zeal displayed by you in your former
“ investigations.”
During the past few years, owing to the amount of knowledge displayed in
his writings, the Gippsland Press, backing up the recommendations of the Mining
Board, persistently urged his transference to the scientific and professional branch
of the Mining Department as Assistant Geologist, to which position he was formally
appointed by the Governor-in-Council on April 7. In 1878 he was appointed Land
Officer at Omeo, in charge of perhaps the largest survey district in the colony,
and certainly the one in which the largest area of land was available for settlement
under the new Land Act of 1884. His duties in this position were not only clerical
and semi-professional, but largely administrative and judicial. Land was being
rapidly taken up, and as was inevitable, conflicting interests arose, which in a great
measure Mr. Stirling was called upon to settle. It was a difficult and delicate
position, but his sense of fairness and justice, in addition to keeping in view the land
policy of the country he was assisting to administer, enabled him to so conscientiously
discharge his duties as ultimately to gain the goodwill and admiration of all. As a
citizen, Mr. Stirling was ever foremost in anything that tended to the advancement
and welfare of the district, especially with regard to the education of the young. He
initiated, and was largely instrumental in carrying out, a system of annual competitive
examinations for children of the State Schools, and exerted his best to procure books
and prizes for this purpose. For some years Mr. Stirling has occupied the position
of correspondent to the Local Board of Advice, and it is mainly due to him that this
large and scattered district is so well supplied with educational facilities for the
children of the people.
The announcement that he was about to be transferred from the Lands to the
Mining Department gave general satisfaction to the people of the district, who
considered the occasion of his promotion a fitting opportunity to show their appreciation,
not only of Mr. Stirling’s services, but of the universal respect and esteem in which he
is held. His career so far is a bright and encouraging example to the youth of this,
and, indeed, of any country, and shows what difficulties may be overcome, and
success attained, by industry and perseverance. Many a time such remarks as these
have been overhead, when the youth of his own age have been engaged in their
pastimes of cricket and football, young Stirling passed with bag on back, and geological
hammer in hand : —“ There goes Stirling to break some more rocks ! I wonder
what he can see in it! ” But those who jeered have lived to admire, and now feel
proud of the scientific attainments of their fellow-townsman.
In conclusion, it may be interesting to state that all Mr. Stirling’s holidays
appear to have been devoted to scientific explorations, and the amount of work he has

♦Republished in England by Scientific Journals,


REV. JAMES S. H. ROYCE. F.G.S.A.
may be termed the clerical history of Australia, or what may be
ie histor J °f clerical influence in Australia, framed from
deductions of the results of clergymen’s labours, is quite a different
subject-matter to the biography of a clergyman ; from such biographies could be
gathered a portion of the materials necessary to compile a philosophical treatise on
the influence of the clergy on a country’s institutions. And yet in tracing the
career of any public man, it would be difficult to abstain from occasionally hinting at
the effects his work has had upon those institutions. The mere statement of hard
and dry facts would be irksome and devoid of real information to the reader, as one
of those short cuts to knowledge which contain a host of dates, of explanation, or of
events. One might as well hope to learn the English language by committing to
memory all the words in a lexicon, or gain a knowledge of history by “getting up ”
Ince’s Outlines, or acquire a deep spiritual insight into Scripture by reading Bengel’s
Gnomon, or Winer’s Greek Grammar, as to arrive at a conception of a man’s life
without something more than mere assertions. All these are aids to handmaids of
those several departments of knowledge ; but he who begins with these aids for the
purpose of receiving an education might as well hope to prove the celebrated 47th
proposition of Euclid, attributed to Pythagoras, without having grasped those that
precede it. These short sketches, then, are mere aids to a knowledge of men ; they
are written for an object. Those who have their biographies published in this
volume expressly desire that they should illustrate a fact, and convey a lesson. The
fact that they do illustrate is, how men can secure public esteem, and rise to
positions of a responsible character; the lesson they do convey is, that others can go
and do likewise.
Of all callings, perhaps none has contributed so much towards this desirable
end as the members of the clerical profession. They are intimately identified with
the true prosperity, as opposed to the false, of a country; they are observers and
preservers of peace ; they are the police, as a very high authority lately termed them,
of the nation. To such a class as here has an attempt been made to rough-sketch,
belongs the Eev. James S. H. Royce, who was born at Chilham, Kent, England, in
October, 1829. He was educated at Canterbury, and when very young entered upon a
commercial life. When he removed to Dover he took a great interest in all work
connected with the Wesleyan Church, and his ability and zeal gaining for him the


respect of the people, he was frequently invited to engage in lay preaching in
connection with his denomination. Having decided on devoting his talents and
time to the preaching of the Gospel, he was nominated, at the age of twenty-two, as
a candidate for the ministry. He passed the necessary examinations very
successfully, and was accepted by the British Conference in 1852, and sent to
Richmond College, where he paid particular attention to classical studies during his
three years’ course.
Fired with true missionary zeal, which he felt to be an intimation that he was
destined for such work, he determined to go to some distant field of heathenism, and
labour to reclaim those who were immersed in darkness. He was appointed to Fiji
in 1855, and left England the same year, arriving in Melbourne in 1856, at which
place and Sydney some weeks were spent on the way to the South Seas. The
Friendly Islands were also visited, where he and his party were introduced to George
Tubou, the King of Tonga. At the time when Mr. Royce arrived in Fiji, the major
part of the Group was in a deplorable state of barbarism, but he had the gratifying
reflection with which to console himself that a great change for the better had taken
place during the period of his labours there.
Thakombau, who was often his guest, received baptism, and renounced
heathenism, polygamy, and cannibalism. Missionaries have been and are the most
useful pioneers England ever possessed, for they have penetrated into regions which
others would hesitate to approach, and in the course of time they have removed the
barriers which opposed the white man’s entrance, and they have been instrumental in
adding territory to the British Empire and increasing the supremacy of England.
It was during the career of Mr. Royce in Fiji that the American difficulty led
Thakombau, on the advice of the missionaries, to sign over the sovereignty of the
Group to the British Crown. When Colonel Smythe, R.A., was sent out as
Commissioner, Mr. Royce received him, Dr. Simian the naturalist, and Consul Pritchard
as guests, and gave them the benefit of his experience and knowledge of the natives,
and also performed the duties of interpreter for the Crown at the Island of Kandavu.
The tropical climate, combined with his excessive labours, compelled him to leave, in
broken-down health, in 1861. Since that time he has laboured in various parts of
Victoria and the adjoining colonies, either as a deputation or as a stated clergyman.
Amongst many very important charges Mr. Royce has held, Colac may be singled
out as one in which he was eminently successful. When he commenced his duties
there, on April 2nd, 1877, he found the church burdened with a debt which was not
a light one, when the number of the population is considered. He, however, set to
work and raised a large sum of money for the church by his lectures on Fiji,
which largely contributed to the instruction of the inhabitants. In spite of all
the calls made upon his time by church work, he found it possible to give
his attention to every movement tending to the improvement and development
of the district. He had the interest of the community at heart, and by
manly conduct and bearing he earned the goodwill of all sections of Colac
and neighbourhood. It is impossible to overrate the importance of the work

he accomplished both there and elsewhere, incessantly working in his study
or amongst his people. A conception of his unremitting toil can only be formed by
glancing over the work performed by him during his charge of one or two places.
In three years at Preston, for instance, he preached 681 sermons, and in one year
travelled 3,000 miles; and at Tarnagulla, where he was stationed for a similar period,
he delivered 572 sermons, and built six churches. In all, from his arrival in Victoria
in 1861, until his departure from Colac in 1880, he preached 3,389 sermons,
delivered 200 missionary addresses, attended fully a thousand meetings, and
lectured 71 times on Fijian and other subjects. At his present station, Sale, he has
sustained the position of Chairman of the district. In 1886 he was elected a Fellow
of the Geological Society of Australia, an honour to which he was justly entitled.
His collection of the fauna of these colonies is extensive, while the cabinets of shells
and the variety of war clubs collected in the South Seas is scarcely to be surpassed.
In 1887 Mr. Royce, having received permission from the ministers comprising the
Conference of Victoria to visit England, sailed in the “ Carthage ” on March 10th,
and was expected to be one of the speakers at the May meeting, Exeter Hall, London.
He takes with him a letter of commendation which is a handsome certificate of
character, testifying to the estimation in which he is held by Australians; and there
is no doubt that he will maintain his reputation in the old country as a man of large
experience, sound and liberal views, and good classical attainments.


CHARLES TODD, M.A, C.M.G.
||VT is unnecessary, indeed it would be a work of supererogation, to introduce
aA Jp f° the notice of the public, in the manner frequently adopted by writers
Apl of biographies, anything approaching a grandiloquent preface of the
life and labours of the gentleman whose name stands at the head of this
memoir. Moreover, and we say it respectfully, there is not much to be related
concerning him, as that life and those labours are directed towards and spent on
subjects which do not possess that all-absorbing interest for general readers which
is found to obtain in the domains of politics, commerce and religion. Suffice it,
therefore, to say that his name and reputation are adequately recognised by the
most distinguished scientists of the day, and that he has been the recipient of
many well-deserved compliments from the Press and the various societies with
which he is identified, or to whom he is known. He has, after indefatigable
labour, and by the closest attention to his studies, achieved success in that now
generally admitted all-important field of research —Astronomy—a branch of
learning without a slight knowledge of which no one is considered as having
received a fairly good education. Indeed, many of the higher schools regard
Astronomy so important as a means of mental training that it is included in their
curriculum. But, apart from this consideration, when it is borne in mind how
useful the science has been in unravelling many mysteries hitherto unintelligible,
and dissipating many theories, long accepted, but now rejected, we cannot avoid
feeling grateful to all those who have occupied themselves in prosecuting
astronomical investigations. There is one great advantage to be derived from
these higher studies —they tend to elevate the mind. For what man is there
with a true scientific conception of the universe who does not feel the surpassing
grandeur and infinite power of Him who fashioned it with His fingers after
havhm called it into existence by His will? The telescope of the astronomer
brings close to him the mighty depths of the heavens, and while he paces the
roof of his observatory, engaged in this the sublimest of studies, he is enabled
(unspeakable privilege !) to hold converse —in thought, at least —with other worlds,
and, as he gazes, an irresistible feeling comes over him to utter with the psalmist,
“ What is man that Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that Thou
visitcst him ?” To give a brief history of Astronomy among ancient nations
may not prove uninteresting. It would be out of place to speak of right ascension
and declination, parallax of a star, refraction, aberration of light, the precession of
the equinoxes, and innumerable other terms ", but it may be as well to state, so
as to give the uninitiated some idea of what is necessary to qualify a man to
take an observation, that he must have learned mathematics thoroughly, from plain
trigonometry up to the quadrature of the parabola, and then his work begins.
The sensation experienced by the tyro when, on the first occasion he takes his
time from the sidereal clock —gridiron or mercurial —and sees the object enter
the field of observation, and pass across the wires, in earlier days made of spider
threads, or when he reclines on his back, and by the aid ol the transit instrument


and mural circle, now superseded by the transit circle, gets the right ascension
and declination of a star, can well he imagined, but not described. However,
leaving equatorials, azimuths, and the many other appliances in an observatory
to that long list of distinguished men who have devoted their lifetime to the
study of the science, it can be said that, in all probability, Astronomy may be
regarded as the most ancient of the sciences.
Greek historians unanimously testify that the earliest traces of astronomical
science are to be met with among the Chaldeans and Egyptians, the latter being, in
ancient times, the rivals of the former in the cultivation of Astronomy. It does
not appear, from any facts mentioned by ancient authors, that the Phoenicians, who
are to be considered as one of the nations who cultivated Astronomy at a very
early period, devoted special attention to the observation of the heavens, or made
any discoveries relative to the motion of the planets.
In China, Astronomy has received great attention from the remotest ages,
and has always been considered as indispensably necessary to the civil government
of the State. The Astronomy of the Indians presents a problem for solution
which, notwithstanding much discussion, still continues involved in great
uncertainty. We have, unfortunately, no sources of information on the subject of
the science of ancient nations, except accounts founded on conjecture and
traditions, for few monuments remain to confirm or confute the descriptions given bv
authors of its great antiquity and perfection. We have, however, reliable data
to support the claims of the Indians. These are the tables from which thev
compute the eclipses and places of the planets, and the methods by which the
computation was effected. There is, in short, an Indian Astronomy committed to
writing, which represents the celestial phenomena pretty accurately, and which,
therefore, only a people far advanced in science could accomplish. There is
great difficulty in deciding where the science originated. On the whole, it may,
without fear of much contradiction, be stated that India fostered the science, but
that it did not have its origin in that country, as some authors (by whom it is
considered to be the cradle of all the sciences, particularly Astronomy) assert.
Others date the origin of Indian Astronomy from the period when Pythagoras
travelled into that country, and carried the arts and sciences of the Greeks
thither. Perhaps the most improbable account is that of the Arabians having
introduced Astronomy into India in the ninth century of our era, and that the
Brahmins are only entitled to the merit of adapting the rules and methods of
that people to their own modes of calculation. In b.c. 160-125, we meet with
the renowned astronomer, Hipparchus, who made the great discovery of the
precession of the equinoxes. The number of stars catalogued by this famous man
was 1080. The most renowned among the Greeks engaged in the study were
Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, and a host of others.
Besides these may be mentioned the names of Ptolemy, Copericus (a Prussian),
Kepler, Tycho Brache, Galileo, Horrox (a Liverpool youth who died very young),
Napier, Herschel, Laplace, Huyghens, and the many English, Continental and
American astronomers of the present day. The facilities afforded for astronomical


observations in this country, owing to its cloudless skies, are so superior to those of
other parts of the world that it may confidently be anticipated that in time Australian
astronomers will hold a prominent position in this science. As it is, much valuable
information has been contributed by gentlemen who have embraced the study for the
love of it, and by the Government Astronomers, one of whom is Mr. Charles Todd,
who was born in July, 1826, and educated at Greenwich. In December, 1841,
he entered as a cadet and calculator at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, under
Mr. (now Sir) G. B. Airy, K.C.8., then the Astronomer-Royal. In 1848 he was
appointed assistant at Cambridge. In 1854 he was appointed one of the astronomers
of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and had charge of the then new Electrical
Department. In February, 1855, he was appointed by Lord John Russell
Superintendent of Telegraphs and Government Astronomer for the province of
South Australia, and, on the amalgamation of the Post Office and Telegraph
Departments, he was appointed Postmaster-General of South Australia, succeeding
Mr. Lewis, who, shortly after, was appointed Collector of Customs. In August, 1870,
the overland telegraph line to Port Darwin was commenced, and completed in August,
1872. Considerable delay was occasioned in the construction of this line, the entire
length of which is 1973 miles, owing to the withdrawal of the contractors from a
portion of the work, and the numerous obstacles that presented themselves; whereupon
the Government entrusted the completion of this gigantic task to Mr. Todd, who, as is
well known, carried it out successfully. An interesting account is given by Mr.
Todd, to whom the inception and construction are mainly due, of the difficulties
which the constructing party had to surmount. Hard as it may be to live at the
present time in the Northern Territory, it may be said that the residents there are
now in possession of comforts which it would have been a sheer impossibility
to have obtained in the days of which we are writing, and, consequently, the
constructing party must have endured great hardships. On the completion of
this work, the Queen was pleased to recognise Mr. Todd’s services by conferring
on him the Order of St. Michael and St. George.
In 1885, Mr. Todd attended, as the representative of South Australia, the
International Telegraph Conference at Berlin, and subsequently inspected the
Postal and Telegraph Departments, as well as the principal observatories of Europe
and England, and read a paper on “ Telegraph Enterprise in South Australia”
before the Royal Colonial Institute in February, 1880. During the same year, while
in England, the University of Cambridge conferred upon him the degree of
“Honorary Master of Arts,” an honor granted only to a very few men for eminent
scientific services alone. Mr. Todd is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomers’ Society,
Meteorological Society, Society of Telegraph Engineers, honorary member of the
Imperial Meteorological Society in Germany, and other learned Societies in various
parts of the world. The Colonies and India of February 12, 1886, contains a report of
a paper read by Mr. Todd, in St. James’s Banqueting Hall, on Tuesday, February 9th,
and in the following issue a discussion on the paper is reported. In the
“ University Intelligence” of the London Times of March 12th, 1886, appeared the
following:—“ Cambridge of Arts (honoris causa)— Charles Todd, C.M.G.,
Postmaster-General and Superintendent of Telegraphs in South Australia,”


THE HON. SIR ROBERT DALRYMPLE ROSS, K. 8.,
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.
WfSP 0 furtlier the development of a country, it is necessary that its legislators
sfjjlß should not he influenced by corrupt motives or sellish interests. When a
state of prosperity is experienced, it is very probable that individual
claims will he advanced, to the detriment of the general welfare; but in times
of adversity, there is little need for apprehension on this score. It is then that
rival claims and political antagonism are thrown aside, the only danger being that
over-legislation will ensue, such is the anxiety to adopt measures which will be
conducive to a return of commercial and agricultural activity. Doubtless, the mere
adventurer, with a face of political brass, will endeavour to disturb the legislative
fittings, so to speak, in order to derange the Government machinery, and, by causing
an explosion, hope to have public attention attracted towards him. Rarely aie
the politicians of South Australia guilty of such a charge, political asperities and
partizan politics being less known there than in some of the other colonies. To the
Speaker of a House is this happy state of affairs more or less due, as by his moderation,
firmness, tact, and courtesy, debates are conducted with that decorum becoming
to an assembly of gentlemen charged with the grave responsibility of introducing
and passing laws tending to the maintenance of peace and prosperity. For the
possession of these virtues, to which allusion has been made, Sir Robert Dalrymple
Ross, Speaker of the House of Assembly, South Australia, is well known. Sir Robert
was born in the Island of St. Vincent in the year 1828. His family, both on the
paternal and maternal sides, have for the past 250 years taken an active part in
promoting settlements in England’s American and West Indian colonies. His
father, John Pemberton Ross, inherited plantations in Antigua, St. Kitts, and
St. Vincent, and married a daughter of Dr. Alexander Anderson, a well-known
naturalist and botanist of the last century, and a contemporary and great friend of
Sir Joseph Banks. On the maternal side, Sir Robert is a direct descendant of
Sir William Alexander, the first Earl of Stirling, a Scottish poet and statesman,
especially beloved by the short-lived Prince Henry, and who received many
substantial marks of Royal favour from King Janies and his successors. In 1021,
Sir William Alexander obtained a grant of the territory of Nova Scotia, and with a
view of enabling him to raise funds for the settlement of the country, along with the
title of Baronet which was conferred on him, he was authorised to divide the lands
into one hundred portions, and to dispose of these for the stipulated price of


SirRobertDalrympleRoss




<£2oo each. He acquired another source of revenue by having granted to him
the privilege of issuing base copper coins, denominated “ turners.” In 1631, he
was hnally created Earl of Stirling, Viscount of Canada, and Lord Alexander of
Tullibody.
In 1635, he obtained from the Council of New England an extensive
grant of land, including what was then called Stirling, and afterwards Long Island,
and is to be considered the founder of that settlement which produced the State
of New York. The Earldom of Stirling has been dormant since the death of the
fifth Earl in 1730—the question of succession a few years ago having occupied the
attention of the Courts of Scotland,
Sir Robert Dalrymple Ross served for many years in the Imperial Army
as an officer of the Commissariat Department, and, at his own request, was placed
on the retired list when the department was re-organised in 1871. He then
came out to take up his residence at Highercombe, a property he had purchased in
1866 from the Honourable G. M. Waterhouse. While in the army, he saw a good
deal of active service, and during the Crimean war was attached to the Turkish
contingent force. He was stationed with the force on the Buyukdere, on the
Bosphorus, afterwards at Kertch, and finally at Yenikale, on the Sea of Azof,
where he remained till its disbandonment, consequent on the conclusion of peace
in 1856. For his services in the contingent, he was thanked in General Orders, and
received the Turkish medal. He next volunteered for service on the West Coast of
Africa, and was sent to Capo Coast Castle as Senior Commissariat Officer, where he
remained till 1859, holding several civil appointments, as well as the membership of
both Legislative and Executive Councils. In 1858 he was appointed by Governor
Sir B. C. C. Bine Acting Colonial Secretary. Shortly afterwards, the Governor,
owing to ill-health, was obliged to return to England, and Sir Robert might then,
had he so pleased, have assumed the Government, according to the provisions of the
Constitution. However, as soon as Sir B. C. C. Pine left, Sir Robert caused the senior
military officer to be sworn in and proclaimed Acting-Governor, an illegal proceeding,
which necessitated an Ordinance being passed indemnifying Colonel Bird for his
illegal acts.
When the health of Governor Bine broke down, war with Ashantee was
threatened, and a revolt of other tribes daily expected, owing to the unsatisfactory
relations which existed between the Government of the Gold Coast and the King of
Ashantee, as well as several tributary kings and chiefs within the protected
settlements. It was under these circumstances that Governor Pine selected Sir
Robert for the position of Colonial Secretary, and decided to place him at the head
of the administration of affairs. Sir Robert, however, rather than excite ill-feeling
amongst the officers of the Gold Coast Artillery, resigned the Government of the
Settlements, together with the emoluments accruing therefrom, in favour of the
senior military officer on the coast, while at the same time the whole onus of the
administration rested on him, as Colonial Secretary. Sir Robert eventually
succeeded in settling the existing disputes with the aggrieved chiefs, but at the same


time afforded the protection of the British flag to the refugee slaves. The difficulty
with the King of Ashantee was scarcely concluded when the Crobboes and Adampes
broke out into open revolt. All the available troops ol the Gold Coast Artillery
force were sent to Pram-Pram, near the river Volta, to oppose them, Sir Robert
remaining at Cape Coast Castle, as the Fantees were alarmed, and doubtful as to the
course the King of Ashantee would adopt when he heard of the revolt, and the
failure of his delegates to obtain the redress he sought from the Government of the
Gold Coast. In fact they feared an invasion. The troops which marched against
the revolted tribes suffered a repulse in the first engagement, and were forced to
retire till re-inforcements could he sent to their aid. Sir Robert at once proceeded
to Pram-Pram, and, after anxious deliberation, he undertook the serious task of
raising an auxiliary force from the neighbouring tribes on friendly relations with the
Government. In less than six weeks he brought into the field an auxiliary force of
nearly 15,000 natives, being careful to obtain only those who spoke the Ga dialect—
the language of the Crobboes and Adampes—firmly declining aid from any of the
Fantee tribes.
This force soon surrounded the stronghold of the Crobboes, and their king
seeing that it was useless to resist, surrendered himself and troops, and submitted
to the terms imposed by the Government, paying an indemnity of TIO,OOO towards
the cost of the war. The king was dethroned and imprisoned. This was the first
and only instance on the Gold Coast in which so formidable a revolution was
suppressed without cost to the Imperial exchequer and without any appeal to Sierra
Leone. It was entirely owing to Sir Robert’s energy and foresight, that a great
disaster did not overtake the protected territories. Scarcely had this difficulty been
settled when an insurrection broke out among the Fantee tribes in the Abrah
country, which, through the energetic measures adopted by Sir Robert, resulted in
its suppression, several of the chiefs engaged in it being severely punished and
heavily fined. Sir Robert’s success in all his negotiations with the tributary kings
and chiefs is due mainly to the fact that he understood the native character, and
invariably treated them with kindly consideration and courtesy. In his official
decisions he paid due regard to their customs, when not opposed to Christianity and
natural justice, and viewed them not as barbarians but as a people maintaining the
habits and customs of an older civilisation than that in which it had been his
privilege to be educated.
When, in August, 1859, Sir Robert was about to depart from Cape Coast
Castle, the merchants, kings, and chiefs presented him with an address
complimenting him on his administration amongst them as Colonial Secretary of the
Settlements, and recognising the energy he had displayed in promoting cotton
cultivation in the country. The address, moreover, recorded the fact that the general
policy of the local Government, while he had been Colonial Secretary, was highly
satisfactory to the country, and, in bidding him farewell, wished him happiness and
success. Sir Robert Ross, when at Cape Coast Castle, initiated the negotiations
which eventually led, years afterwards, to the acquisition of the Dutch Settlements on
the Gold Coast by the English Government.


After three years’ continuous and anxious service in an unhealthy climate, Sir
Robert found his health impaired, but not long after his arrival in England he was
appointed to the Commissariat control of the military districts A and B, which then
included the Midland and Northern counties of England, Wales, the Isle of Man, and
Scotland. Next year (1860) he was ordered to China to take part in the expedition
against Pekin, and served at Tientsin with the expeditionary force under General
Sir Hope Grant. On the conclusion of peace (1860) he was appointed Military
Accountant in China, and was stationed at Hongkong until the principal accounts
connected with the expeditionary force were closed. In 1862 the Secretary of State
for War (Sir G. C. Lewis) selected him for the charge of the Department in South
Australia. Shortly after his arrival, Governor Daly appointed him Provincial
Aide-de-camp, and afterwards as his Private Secretary. In 1867 Sir Robert
superintended the arrangements for the reception of H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh,
and, on the departure of H.R.H., was officially thanked by Governor Daly for the
zeal and ability he had displayed throughout all his arrangements. In 1864 Sir
Robert went to New Zealand, serving in 1864-5 against the Maoris, and received the
New Zealand Medal. At the close of the war he returned to Australia, and, in
1869, on promotion, proceeded to.England.
He was requested by His Excellency Sir James Fergusson to visit India cn
route, and place the views of the South Australian Government before the Viceroy,
Lord Mayo, with regard to the establishment of a Remount Depot at Port Darwin.
Sir Robert, while at Simla, gave evidence before the Stud Commission, then sitting
under the Presidency of General Troup. Lord Mayo also requested him to make a
special report upon the Madras Stud Commission Report, then just received. On
leaving Simla, Sir Robert was officially thanked by the Governor-General in Council
for the valuable information he had afforded on the subject of supply of remounts for
the army in India, and also for his observations on the report of the Madras Stud
Commission. When in London, at the close of 1869, Sir Robert rendered eminent
service to South Australia, and indeed to Australasia as a whole, by advocating in
letters to the Times, the importance of telegraphic communication with Australia, via
Port Darwin. His proposition was that the work should be undertaken on
commercial principles, without subsidies from the Australasian Governments. The
Times endorsed his views, and the Directors of the British-Australian Telegraph
Company, who had previously stated it to be a work of the future, as it could not be
undertaken without a subsidy, were so impressed by the force of his arguments that
they issued the prospectus of a company, with a capital of T600,000, to lay a cable to
Port Darwin, and a land line to Normanton.
In three days they received applications for shares amounting to T1,500,000.
In December, 1869, he was ordered at brief notice to proceed to Ireland, to take
charge of the flying columns then in course of organisation at Limerick, Tipperary,
and other places, as a demonstration against the Fenians. In May, 1870, when the
columns were disbanded, he went to England, and was stationed at Manchester on
duty in the Control Department. In 1871 he retired, and came out to South


xf W
• •— u 4
Australia for permanent settlement, and has ever since taken an active interest in all
public matters in the colony. In 1872 he interested himself in a project to construct
a line of railway from Port Augusta to Port Darwin, on the land grant principle,
which was influentially supported, but the Government had not yet undertaken a
broad and comprehensive policy in connection with public works. In 1875 Sir
Robert was elected to represent Wallaroo district in the House of Assembly, and
continued to do so until it was, under the Electoral Bill of 1882, divided into two
districts. At next general election he was elected for Gumeracha, and in June, 1870,
he joined the Colton ministry as treasurer, remaining in office until October, 1877,
when the ministry resigned. On the death of Mr. F. S. Dutton, C.M.G., in January,
1877, the Cabinet offered Sir Robert the appointment of Agent-General in
London ; but he declined it, and the following month he recommended Sir A. Blyth,
who was accordingly appointed. For five successive years Sir Robert has been
President of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society, and is still associated
with several institutions of a useful character. He takes a great interest in
horticultural and viticultural pursuits, and many of his experiments in both branches
have proved of great practical benefit. He has been a member of the several
Exhibition Commissions during the past decade; is one of the governors of St.
Peter’s Collegiate School, and has for years been a member of the University
Council. On the death of the late Speaker, Sir G. S. Kingston, Sir Robert was
unanimously elected to fill that distinguished office. He still holds the office, having
been four times unanimously elected to fill that high position—on January 4, 1881,
June 2, 1881, June 5, 1884, and in June, 1887. For his unremitting labours, his
pure disinterestedness, his high-mindedness, and his distinguished career Her Majesty
was pleased to confer on him in the year 1886 the honour of K.B.

THE HONOURABLE JAMES SERVICE.
4A|U BTR. ALT AN politics, so far, have offered but little scope for the display of
those broader and more diplomatic capacities of statesmanship that give
a public man a reputation beyond his own borders. Our interests,
important as they are, and vitally so, to us locally, are too small to offer a field
for the display of the higher developments of statecraft. Our political history,
therefore, is largely made up of the recital of the contests of conflicting local interests,
and the development of local organisation and growth. It is properly so. In young
communities like our own, first concerns should be those immediately affecting
ourselves, and if it be true that that country is happy that has no history, the adage
doubly applies if taken as referring to the desirability of the absence of foreign
relations. But these Australian colonies have now attained an age when outer
concerns must be forced more or less upon our notice. The colonies themselves bear
a species of international relationship to each other. And in dealing with this,
abilities of a high and marked kind are required. An opportunity for the display of
such is afforded by the question of intercolonial Federation. The subject is surrounded
with difficulties. Intercolonial prejudice —not in itself entirely a bad thing, inasmuch
as it promotes healthy emulation and rivalry,—and conflicting interests of no small
importance, hedge the question in every direction. There can be no doubt as to the
abstract desirability of Federation. The congeries of settlements that have now grown
up into important states naturally forms a federal union of itself, and it is but
distorting a natural condition of things to make artificial distinctions between these
children of a common mother. Border Duties and Copyright Laws are simply
anomalies when they do not work harmoniously between colony and colony. And
the thousand harassing disabilities that hamper commercial interests with branches
of the same house in various colonies, are so many sharp, if small, arguments against
the absurdity of dis-union. It has been the great work of the political life of the
subject of this biography to do away with this state of things, by taking a decided
step towards the Federation of these Australian colonies. In doing so he has travelled
outside the usual orbit of Australian politics, and ventured into the higher walk. His
conduct of the matter shows that he essayed no rash and ill-judged experiment.
What might have been presumption and audacity in a less capable man, has been
crowned with a larger and promising measure of success by the actions of the
Honourable James Service, whose name will be writ in the political records of the
aftertime as the founder of Australian Federation.
The career of Mr. James Service is that of one of those merchant princes, who,
in all countries add so much to the vertebrate strength of the state, in the public life


of which they hike a worthy part. Ho was born at Kilwinning, Ayrshire, November
1828. His education was partly obtained at the chief school of his birthplace, and
partly by private tuition. When a little over twenty years of age lie turned his
attention to mercantile affairs, and in 184G we find him engaged in business of this
nature in Glasgow. Here he remained until 1853, when he emigrated in August of
that year, and on his arrival in Melbourne at once entered on his career as a
merchant in Bourke Street West. The cares of his business, which ho has always
kept well in mind, did not prevent his taking a fair share in public matters. From the
first he appears to have shown that active interest in the questions affecting the
welfare of his adopted city which he afterwards exhibited in a much wider sphere.
The first incident that opened the way for an active display of interest was the
agitation in progress shortly after his arrival for the separation of the suburb of
Emerald Hill from the City of Melbourne. When a measure to that effect eventually
passed the Legislature, Mr. Service, who had identified himself closely with the
progress of the matter, was chosen first chairman of the new municipality. It is also
noticeable that about the same time he was appointed a magistrate of the territory.
Ho again held the chairmanship of the Emerald Hill Town Council, alternating
therein with Mr. Anderson, with whom he afterwards contested the representation of
the electorate in Parliament. Another matter which brought him into prominence
was the part he took in successfully opposing the Hobson’s Bay Railway Company in
the course it had taken of improperly cutting up the streets at ill-chosen levels. All
these matters were gradually, but surely bringing Mr. Service before the public ; so
that it is not surprising to find his name mentioned, in a few years, in connection with
a seat as an elected representative to the Parliament of the country. The occasion,
in his case, was offered by the resignation of Mr. (afterwards Sir William) Stawell of
his seat as one of the members for Melbourne, consequent on his acceptance of the
office of Chief Justice of Victoria, in the room of Sir William a’Beckett, who had
retired, February, 1857. At this time the first O’Shanassy Ministry held office, and
Mr. James Murphy was deputed to contest the electorate in the interest of that party.
Mr. Service was induced to come forward for the same place, and the election resulted
in his return to Parliament for the first time. The contest was looked upon as a
significant one, and as its result the successful candidate next figures in the House
as seconding a motion of want of confidence in the administration, which was carried,
April 29, 1857. The second Haines Ministry succeeded, and lasted eleven months,
being followed by the second O’Shanassy Ministry, which lasted from March, 1858, to
October, 1859. By this time the new Electoral Bill divided Melbourne into three
electorates,—East, West, and North, and at the election for the new electorates Mr.
Service thought fit to offer himself to the acceptance of the Voters of Emerald Hill,
where he was well and favourably known. Here, however, he was met by his old
rival in the town council, Mr. Anderson, and defeated by less than 100 votes. He
was at once invited to accept the suffrages of two other electorates, Avoca, and
Ripon and Hampden. He chose the latter, and was elected and took his seat for
Ripon and Hampden. The O’Shanassy Ministry was succeeded in October, 1859, by
that of Mr, William Nicholson, who offered Mr. Service the Portfolio of President of


the Board of Land and Works, and Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey. He
took office, and in that capacity introduced the first Land Bill providing for free
selection in Victoria. His colleagues in this Administration were as follow:
William Nicholson, Chief Secretary; John Dennistoun Wood, Attorney-General;
James McCulloch, Treasurer; John Charles King, succeeded by James Goodall
Francis, Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works, and Commissioner of
Public Works; Vincent Pyke, Commissioner of Trade and Customs; Travers
Adamson, succeeded by James Frederic Martley, Solicitor-General; John Robinson
Bailey, succeeded by Hibbert Newton, Postmaster-General; and Thomas Howard
Fellows, in the Upper House without office. Several changes took place in this
Ministry, chiefly caused by an interchange of Portfolios on the resignation of Messrs.
Service and Francis ; and later on Dr. Augustus F. A. Greeves took the office of the
former in September, 1860, three weeks before the Administration broke up. This
event traceable to a disagreement arising from the Land Bill, which measure, for its
own importance as well as this circumstance, merits a passing attention. On
November 30, 1850, Mr. Service introduced his Land Bill into the Legislative
Assembly, and in doing so delivered a speech explanatory of its scope and purport,
from which we will take this excerpt:— 1 “ The chief feature in the Ministerial Land Bill
is that of free selection over all the waste lands of the colony for agricultural purposes ;
subject to certain conditions with respect to lands not yet surveyed, and the special
lands which have acquired or may acquire a special value. This Bill purposes to
throw open the entire waste lands of the Crown for selection to those parties who
may be desirous of settling on it tor agricultural purposes ; and with respect to lands
which are not at the present time in the possession of settlers, or even those which
have not yet been surveyed for the purpose of sale,--that even those should be thrown
open to parties desirous of settling thereon. But in such cases there are certain
conditions annexed to the disposal of these lands, which are not annexed to others
that have been surveyed by the Government for the purpose of settlement. We
propose to have all the country land surveyed in sections of 320 acres each, and that
every purchaser shall have the power of selecting an allotment for appropriation at
a uniform rate of 20s per acre. ... It is provided that no man shall
be allowed to take up less than an 80-acre section, but he will be allowed to purchase
one-fourth, on payment for 20 acres —all these sections are subdivided into four parts
—and that any person requiring to purchase, and who is a hona fuk purchaser, shall
have the option of stating whether he desires to leave the remaining three portions
of the allotment for a period of not less than five, or more than ten, years, at a
rental of not more than 2s. per acre, with the option of renting one, two, or three
sub-divisions at the same time he purchases one sub-division ; so that the principle
of the bill is simply this, —any person possessing .£2O may have the opportunity
of selecting a farm to the extent of 20 acres, —a farm which, if he chooses to rent
the remainder of the allotment, will be a farm of 80 acres ; and the same principle
applies to sections of a larger description.” This extract conveys the gist of the
measure proposed, which may be compared by the curious with that sketched
about the same time by the leaders of public opinion on the same subject in New


South Wales. The same obstacles to legislation encountered in the older colony
by the advocates of land law reform, naturally enough presented themselves also in
Victoria. The conflict between the interests of capital and enterprise on the subject
of the national lands produced a party feeling quite as keen, and has made the land
question here quite as difficult a matter to deal with. As there is no problem of
practical legislation of a more difficult nature than that which forms the core ol
this particular question, so there is no point in the sea of party politics round which
the opposing currents of opinion eddy in more violent vortices. The Land Law has
been for many years a stumbling block to the business of the country in other
colonies besides our own, and, perhaps, Mr. Service was over-sanguine when he
proposed to put it beyond the possibility of ever becoming “ a weapon of party
warfare in years to come.” At all events his courageous attempt was not successful.
Though he succeeded in getting it through the Legislative Assembly, it was severely
criticised in the Upper House, and returned so mutilated by amendments, that the
Minister resolved to take a definite stand on his original proposals. An idea of
the Council’s opposition may be gleaned from the fact that one of its amendments
had the effect of limiting the use of leased lands to pastoral purposes alone, thus
completely nullifying the peculiar advantages offered by the new bill to the small
agricultural settler. Some considerable effort was certainly made to bring both
Houses in accord in the matter, but without success. Mr. Service then announced
that, after mature deliberation and enquiry, the Government proposed to revive one
of the old Orders-in-Council to deal with the difficulty. The Order was to the effect
that it should be competent for the Governor, or other officer administering the
Government of the colony, to grant leases of land for periods not exceeding one year,
for pastoral and other purposes, in any part of the colony. No reference was made
to the right of allowing deferred payments in these Orders, but Mr. Service held that
they gave him the same right to lease as to sell by auction. It was of course
insisted that these Orders-in-Council were swept away by the Constitution Act
under which the rights of both branches of the Legislature were defined, but the
discussion came to an abrupt termination by the resignation of both Mr. Service and
Mr. Francis, as before related. The representative of the Government in the
Upper House, Mr. Fellows, took the part of his fellow-members, and, as it would
appear that the Premier, Mr. Nicholson, had also leanings in the same direction, the
defection mentioned took place. The matter excited great popular commotion. A
meeting was held in the Eastern Market to discuss the crisis that ensued, and on the
following day, the House was besieged by an immense crowd, who broke the library
windows with stones, and seriously injured three mounted policemen who formed part
of a body sent to disperse them. On this occasion Mr. Ireland informed the House
that the police would have been legally justified in firing on the rioters without
reading the Riot Act, since they had been first attacked in the discharge of their duty.
The action of both Mr. Service and Mr. Francis in this matter placed them very high
in the opinion of their constituents, who presented them respectively with handsome
testimonials in recognition of their public spirit. The Administration broke up
within two months afterwards, and Mr. Heales, who next accepted the duty of


forming a Ministry, offered both gentlemen portfolios, which they declined. About
two years after this—that is, during 1862 —Mr. Service visited England. Before
his departure, and as soon as his intention had become known, his constituents of
Ripon and Hampden evinced, in a marked manner, their sense of his value as a
representative, by inviting him to retain his seat for their electorate for a year, and
in the event of his not being prepared to return, then they would be ready to consider
his proposal to resign. Their member, however, appears to have held strong views
on the subject of parliamentary representatives leaving their electorates without
representation during their absence abroad, and declined the proposal made him.
During his trip, Mr. Service visited the Old Country and travelled over the Continent
of Europe, returning in time to take part in the agitation then in progress consequent
on the setting aside by the Legislative Council of the Customs Bill, “ tacked ” on to
the Appropriation Act hy the M‘Culloch Ministry—a subject with which we deal
more fully elsewhere. It is an evidence of the esteem in which Mr. Service
was held in the colony, to say that his arrival, March 1865, was looked for by those
who could depend on his co-operation in this crisis. He at once took part against
the Ministerial proposals, and made himself so conspicuous by his opposition to the
popular feeling that, on his contesting the electorate of Ballarat East against Mr.
W. M. K. Yale, in 1868, he was defeated by the Ministerial candidate. He also
contested Collingwood and West Melbourne, but was rejected by both constituenceis.
At that time no candidate had the remotest chance of election who was not in
harmony with the M‘CuUoch Ministry, and opposed to the action of the Legislative
Council. Mr. Service shared the fate of many others, and remained out of
Parliament until 1874, when he was returned at the general election for Maldon,
which electorate he has since continued to represent. Shortly after his election he
was offered a portfolio in the Kerferd Ministry, as Treasurer, his colleagues being
Messrs. George Briscoe Kerferd, Premier and Attorney-General; James Joseph
Casey, Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey, President of Board of Land and
Works, and Minister of Agriculture ; Duncan Gillies, Commissioner of Railways and
Roads, and a Vice-President of the Board of Lands and Works; Robert Stirling
Anderson, M.L.C., Commissioner of Public Works and a Vice-President of
the Board of Land and Works ; Edward Cohen, Commissioner of Trade
and Customs; Angus Mackay, Minister of Mines and of Public Instruction;
Robert Ramsay, Postmaster-General; and Townsend M‘Dermott, Solicitor-General.
This Administration took office on July -31, 1874, and lasted until August 7,
1875. Mr. Service was not opposed on his offering himself to his constituents
of Maldon for re-election —a piece of good fortune which has accompanied
his appeals to that electorate on each occasion since that time. The Kerferd
Ministry was succeeded by the first Berry Ministry. Mr. Graham Berry, however,
was defeated on his Land Tax two months afterwards, and during the existence of
the Stonewall Brigade, led by that gentleman against the M‘Culloch Ministry which
followed him, Mr. Service used his influence in some measure to effect a compromise
between the two parties, to allow of the public business being carried on. The
M‘Culloch Ministry was succeeded by the second Berry Ministry (May 21, 1877),


which lasted until March, 1880, and covered all the period of the great conflict
between the two Houses, the Reform agitation, the proposed amendment of the
Constitution, and the Berry-Pearson Embassy. Mr. Service sat in opposition to the
Berry party, and took a leading part against their proposed Constitution Act
Alteration and Amendment Act, following Mr. Berry’s speech on introducing that
measure, and repeatedly criticising its provisions until it ultimately fell through.
On an appeal to the constituencies, Mr. Berry thought lit to resign (March, 1880),
after a tenure of office of nearly three years—up to that time the longest in our
political history, with the exception of that of the first M‘Culloch Ministry. Mr.
Service was sent for by his Excellency the Marquis of Normanby, and formed a
Ministry as follows :—James Service, Premier and Treasurer; Robert Ramsay, Chief
Secretary and Minister of Education; Geo. B. Kerferd, Attorney-General; Dr. John
Madden, Minister of Justice; Duncan Gillies, Minister of Railways; John Gavan
Duffy, Minister of Lands; Thomas Bent, Minister of Public Works; Robert Clark,
Minister of Mines and Water Supply; Henry Cuthbert, Commissioner of Customs
and Postmaster-General. The Hon. J. G. Francis and the Hon. R. S. Anderson
holding seats in the Cabinet without office.
On May 20 he introduced a measure to deal with the vexed question of the day,
by altering the Constitution Act and the Legislative Council Act of 1868. In the
speech prefacing this Bill he sketched the formation of the Constitution and its
development under successive Electoral Acts, and stated that the object of his
measure was to lessen the evils of deadlocks similar to those caused by the Tariff
Lock, the Darling Grant Lock, and the Payment of Members Lock. He proposed
to make the Council the reflex of the feeling of the whole of the property owners of
the colony by extending the franchise in respect of elections for members of the
Upper Chamber, and to place the Council more en rapport with the constituencies
by increasing the number of its members to forty-two, and decreasing the duration
of each Council from ten years to six. The opposition to the measure was led by
Sir John O’Shanassy, and, on the question going to a division on the second reading,
the Ministry was left in a minority of two, the voting being forty-one to forty-three.
Mr. Service immediately asked his Excellency for a dissolution on the ground that
the country desired a moderate and satisfactory settlement of this long-vexed
question, and that the House which rejected his proposal was elected under the
auspices of Mr. Berry. That clever party-leader played a deep move on this
occasion, which was, however, checkmated by the Governor granting a dissolution,
June 26, 1880. The O’Loghlen Ministry succeeded, and lasted until April 8, 1883,
when Messrs. Service and Berry coalesced, and formed the Administration of which
the present Ministry are the political legatees. This combination was certainly a
strong one, as representing many shades of political thought. It showed that the
time for a compromise had arrived, and that the country was prepared to hail with
satisfaction the end of the political troubles that had convulsed it so long. Mr.
Service became Treasurer and Minister for Public Instruction in this third Berry
Ministry, his colleagues being Messrs. Graham Berry, Chief Secretary and Postmaster-
General ; Kerferd, Attorney-General; Duncan Gillies, Minister of Railways;


Langridge, Commissioner for Trade and Customs; Levein, Mines and Agriculture:
Tucker, Minister for Lands; and Deakin, President of the Board of Works and
Water Supply. Mr. Service has, from the first, taken a leading part in this
Administration. His name connects itself in the closest manner with the matters
relating to New Guinea, the Education Commission, and the federation of the
Australian colonies, the Land Bill, and the Federal Council Bill. Each one of these
subjects might well form a chapter in itself, and it is only by subdividing the whole
according to the names that respectively associate themselves with each part that
we can do justice to the several subjects. But even on this ground these matters
might well be included in a biographical notice of Mr. Service. We cannot,
however, pass over the large part he took in the formation of the Federal Council
and in preparing the way for the future federation of the Australian colonies.
In November and December, 1888, a Convention of Representatives of the
various colonies was held in Sydney, where the Federation Enabling Bill was agreed
to. Pursuant to which, on June 19, 1884, Mr. Service moved in the Assembly a
resolution “ approving of the resolutions arrived at by the Council in Sydney, in
reference to foreign possessions in the South Seas, and praying that her Majesty
might bo graciously pleased to cause a measure to be submitted to the Imperial
Parliament for the purpose of constituting a Federal Council of Australasia on the
basis ot the draft Bill adopted by the Convention.” In proposing his motion the
Premier spoke as follows : —“ Federation may be said to be twofold, namely,—as it
affects objects of an internal or domestic character, and as it affects objects of an
external or foreign character. So far as objects of an internal character are
concerned, the great purpose Federation has in view is to enable the colonies to do
unitedly and jointly what it is utterly impossible for them to do separately.
Federation is not intended in the slightest degree to interfere with the domestic or
local legislation of the respective local Parliaments.” Mr. Service then read the text
of the Bill as contained in the proceedings of the Convention, and continued:
“ While anxious to most carefully guard the interests of the Parliaments of the
respective colonies by every possible means, yet the Convention could not help
feeling how barren of results previous intercolonial conferences had been. The
outcome had not been worth the time and trouble they had cost. Of twenty-three
subjects during twenty years, some had been discussed, one, two, and three, and one
four times, and not one of these was given effect to by legislation. The people of
these colonies were members of the same race, possessed the same habits and
the same fundamental laws ; and because, for some local reasons—and properly
and justly so —they had drawn an artificial line between certain sections of this
great continent and these Australian islands, is it not absurd that we should deny
ourselves the privilege of united action when such united action can do each of us
great good, and could not by any possibility injure any individual colony ?”
These sentences convey the sense of the arguments in favour of the measure
proposed. An amendment leaving out the words “On the basis of the draft Bill
adopted by the Convention at Sydney ” was negatived by fifty-four votes to five
after a protracted debate. Some other amendments were also proposed by Mr.


Wrixon, one of which would have based the representation in the Federal Council
on the population of each colony. Mr. Service took charge of the measure through
the House, and zealously guarded its provisions. During the course of the
debate he read, amidst great applause, telegrams received from the Premiers of
other colonies announcing the passage of similar resolutions. But a difficulty
occurred with New South Wales over the 81st clause of the Enabling Bill under
which any colony was to be allowed to draw out of the compact if it thought fit.
The New South Wales demands, which are dealt with more at length in the article
on the general subject of Australian Federation in this volume, also included, inter
alia , one for the rescission of the provision allowing any two colonics to remit
matters to the Federal Council for legislation. The result of the disagreement was
that the mother colony held aloof from the Federal League. This resolution was
followed by the Federal Council of Australasia Bill, which was designed to give it
practical effect. On September 9th, 1885, leave was granted to bring in a Bill to
bring into operation in respect of Victoria an Act of the Imperial Parliament intituled
“An Act to Constitute the Federal Council of Australasia.” The measure was
passed, November 10th, 1885, Mr. Kerferd having charge of the measure in the
absence of Mr. Service from the House through illness. In pursuance of this step
the first sitting of the Federal Council took place at Hobart in January of the
following year.
This is the great work of the political career of Mr. James Service. His
record is full of practical work. During the tenure of office of his last Ministry, we
find among the list of important matters decisively dealt with, the Civil Service Act,
Railway Act, Land Act, and the Mining on Private Property Act, the last a measure
which had been no less than twenty-six times under discussion in the Assembly.
In April, 188G, Mr. Service resigned his post in the Ministry, which was
then reconstructed under the leadership of the Hon. Duncan Gillies. Mr. Service
proceeded on another visit to England, where he is at the present time. His life-
story covers a long career of public usefulness, and his absence from the colony
makes a marked gap in our political and commercial circles. He has earned a good
repute for sterling public and private worth, and his long experience of political life
has been worthily crowned by the part he took in—firstly, in knitting together the
discordant elements of party politics in Victoria that had divided the colony so long,
by the formation of the Coalition Ministry; and, secondly, by his laying broad and
deep the foundations of Australian unity on a liberal and politic basis of judicious
Federation.
Mr. Service, although a Constitutionalist in politics, is a Democratic statesman
in the broad sense of the term, and respectfully declined the honour of knighthood,
which Her Most Gracious Majesty signified her willingness to confer upon him, as a
slight recognition of his services in behalf of the Empire.

MR RICHARD GOLDSBROUGH.
not a few of the names so well known in the commercial world
mm are associated with the building up of the Constitution of Victoria,
and with each progressive step towards the goal of responsible
Government, there have been others which, though presenting graphic pictures of
successful career are entirely dissociated with politics, but inseparably intertwined
with the progress of the settlement of the colony. Agricultural and pastoral
settlement within the last few years in Victoria has been marvellously rapid, and it
is mainly owing to the fostering care bestowed on pastoral enterprise by such men as
the subject of this sketch that the Australian colonies have obtained a world-wide
reputation for their flocks and herds, and that the stock-breeding industry has
attained such enormous proportions. It has come to be acknowledged that the
wool-producing industry is of the greatest importance to the colonies, both
individually and collectively, and that incredible and substantial progress has been
made in this direction. Every ordinary occupation or profession has a certain line
of demarcation, within which, the importation of skill, experience, and care towards
its management tends to create vast improvements and to maintain them. However
rare it might be, comparing such improvements with the earlier conditions which
surrounded the occupation prior to the importation of skill, experience, and
energy within the line of demarcation, for these improvements to assume or attain
even approximation to perfection, and justify the stepping up and out of the domain
of the ordinary sphere into the higher region of art. In the case ot sheep-breeding,
the desideratum has been attained, through the enterprise and judgment of some of our
leading sheep-breeders, assisted by a congenial climate. But a very few years ago it
would have been considered an impossibility that Merino sheep could, by skilful
breeding, reach the size and weight they now average. From sixty to seventy
pounds was at one time thought a heavy weight for a fat Merino, but now animals
are bred that will often turn the scale at one hundred and fifty pounds. It is only
fair to assume that the increase of bulk has been accompanied by a corresponding
advance in the quality of the wool which is of longer and better staple than was
produced in the earlier days of settlement. The importance of this improvement
must be gauged from the fact that wool is not the product of Victoria alone, neither
is its growth the exclusive privilege of a very few. Special advantages, and natural
ones too, no doubt, have mainly contributed to the grand results attained, but no mean
share of kudos is due to a force which has united with the sheep-breeders in their
efforts, which has proved itself of equal weight in seconding their exertions by giving
their staple position abroad. The impetus given to Australian wools in the shape ot


supremacy in quality over other wools in the markets of the world, has been greatly
increased by the tenacity with which the force referred to —the combined ability,
energy, and influence of the leading wool houses in stimulating the occupation ot
wool-farming and pushing the raw material into the market of the whole world alter
it has been grown —has sustained a superiority. Eminent among these wool houses
stands that of R. Goldsbrough and Co., and Richard Goldsbrough has justly been
designated “ the father of the wool trade,” and has justly been considered as having
done more for Australia than any other man in bringing her staple product before
the world, and keeping it in sight until it has become as indispensable as cotton.
At least it cannot be refuted that his exertions, and those of his firm, to bring buyers
to Melbourne, never relaxed under any circumstances, and despite persistent and
powerful opposition have done much to establish her position as one of the great
wool marts of the world. The sagacity displayed by him at a time when excitement
ran so high in gold mining that the majority of men’s minds were averse to any
commercial pursuits save such as had immediate or remote connection with it
is recorded in the pages of the earlier commercial history of the colony, in having
been the first and most persistent advocate for the development of an industry
which, unlike gold digging, would be permanent in its results and benefits. The
possession of a calmness of judgment, a commercial prescience, and a power to resist
speculation, is incontestably established when it is borne in mind that he championed
an industry of necessarily slow growth against one of the most luring and exciting
character, and that at a time when men’s minds were surcharged with an excitement
which has known no parallel in modern history, except in California during a similar
epoch between the years 1847 and 1850.
Richard Goldsbrough, the son of Joshua Goldsbrough, was born in October,
1821, at Apsley-house, Shipley, a quiet little township in the West Riding of
Yorkshire, about three miles from Bradford, and in the centre of a large woollen
manufacturing district. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed for seven years to the
late firm of Messrs. John and Lupton Dawson, of Bradford, and there received a
thorough insight into the business of a woolstapler. In 1842, when twenty-one
years of age, that spirit of enterprise which so markedly characterised him, induced
him to commence business on his own account in a comparatively small way in
premises situate in the Old Brown Cowyard, Bradford, where he purchased the
clips of the neighbouring farmers and graziers, and sorted wool for the manufacturers.
During the next five years Mr. Goldsbrough, through untiring energy and forethought,
enlarged his business and made very satisfactory progress. About that time the
continent of Australia began to attract the attention of far-sighted men, who viewed
with great favour the wool-growing capabilities of the colonies, and the extensive
field they presented for business in connection with it. Amongst others who were
so favourably impressed was Mr. Goldsbrough, who, after making all necessary
enquiries as to the resources and prospects of the southern continent, and these
proving eminently satisfactory, embarked at Liverpool in 1847 in the “ Wellington ”
for Australia. Adelaide, which was then on a par with Melbourne as to size, first
attracted his attention, but after an inspection of the two places, Mr. Goldsbrough


determined to establish his lares and pcnates in the Victorian capital. In the year
1848 he commenced business in a weather-board building at the corner of Flinders
Lane and William Street. A marvellous aptitude for business, and a few judicious
ventures, soon enabled him to purchase the premises of Messrs. John Bakewell and
Co., on the opposite corner of the Market Square, and he there in after years
gradually erected the fine bluestone stores now occupied by Messrs. Connell,
Hogarth and Co., Warehousemen. At a time when material and labour were both
matters of serious consideration, and when, between the years 1851 and 1853, the
gold-fever rendered the latter almost unobtainable, the outlay required for this
enterprise was comparatively enormous, and the greatest difficulty was experienced
in carrying out the operations. However, all these troubles were tided
over, and Mr. Goldsbrough reaped his reward in a prosperous business.
In 1853 Mr. Goldsbrough entered into partnership with Mr. E. Row and
Mr. George Kirk under the title of E. Row and Co., afterwards changed to
Row, Kirk & Co., and a large and profitable business was transacted in buying and
selling stock and stations, but apart from the wool business. The squatting pursuit
now offering an opportunity, Mr. Goldsbrough in conjunction with Mr. Kirk,
purchased several extensive stations north of the Murray. All his land speculations
invariably turned out successful. Increasing competition lowering the profits
derivable from sheep and cattle, Mr. Goldsbrough determined to devote himself
entirely to wool. The rapid growth of his busines demanding some assistance for its
management, in 1852 an opportune arrival in the person of Mr. Hugh Parker, a
brother-in-law, in some measure relieved Mr. Goldsbrough of duties that were
becoming too onerous, and so steadfast and diligent was the application of the assistant
that two years after his arrival Mr. Parker obtained an interest in the business and in
1857 became a partner. The business was thenceforth carried on under the style of
R. Goldsbrough & Co. Since that period the history of Mr. Goldsbrough’s fortunes
has simply been that of the progress of the Australian wool trade, and as is
universally known, no name has been more closely allied with that particular
industry. The present magnificent pile of buildings at the corner of Bourke and
William Streets was commenced five years after Mr. Parker’s admission into the firm
as a partner, and has been added to from time to time till now the wool stores of
Goldsbrough & Co. are probably among the finest and most complete in the world.
The magnitude of the premises may be conceived from the fact that the area of the
floors exceeds five acres and the total cost of land and erection of buildings has
amounted to over T150,000. The joint management of Messrs. Goldsbrough and
Hugh Parker, the latter of whom died in 1878, was marked by an uninterrupted
course of prosperity. In 1873 Mr. John Sutcliffe Horsfall, who for many years
previously had taken an active part in the general management, was made a partner,
and in 1870 Mr. Arthur Parker son of Mr. Hugh Parker, and Mr. David Parker
nephew of the same gentleman were also admitted into the business. Mr. David
Parker died recently. In July 1881, the firm was amalgamated with the Australasian
Agency and Banking Corporation, a kindred institution which had been established
in Melbourne for some years, and this amalgamation rendered the business a limited


liability company with a capital of <£3,000,000 in 300,000 shares of £lO each. This
formation into a Limited Liability Company created no change in regard to the
members of the old firm, who continued the management as before, Mr. Goldsbrough
retaining the position of Chairman of Directors.
In addition to the very extensive business carried on in Melbourne, a large
business is supported in Sydney; the warehouses at Pyrmont, close to the Darling
Harbour railway terminus, being considered the largest in the colonies, their
erection alone having cost TOO,OOO. In 1848, when Mr. Goldsbrough started
business in Melbourne, the total export of wool from the city amounted only to some
30,000 bales, or less than half the quantity which has been sold by the company in
Melbourne alone during the last twelve months. The firm does not confine itself to
dealing in wool, since it operates largely in grain, and considerably in skins, hides,
tallow, and other station produce. They also, when occasion serves, make important
sales of squatting and freehold properties, and their annual sales cover over two
millions sterling. Their business has now been established for 37 years, and their
operations extend to all the colonies. A short time ago the surviving partners of
the firm—Mr. J. S. Horsfall, Mr. D. M. Parker, and Mr. Arthur Parker—entered
into an agreement with the company to continue to manage the business for a further
period of five years from that time, so that the conditions of the business remain
practically unchanged. The balance sheet and report for the year ending March
31st, 1886, furnished a very satisfactory result, and some idea of the proportions of
the business alone might be gleaned from the fact that the net profits available were
T40,000 4s. 6d. The report shows that the business is well maintained, the company
having dealt with over 100,000 bales of wool during the year. Considering the
adverse seasons, and the continued decline in values of wool and other pastoral
produce to the time of publication of the report, the returns speak well for the
strong vitality of the wool trade.
In September, 1885, Mr. Richard Goldsbrough became ill with an internal
tumor, which from the first was regarded by his medical attendant, Dr. T. N.
Fitzgerald, as incurable. About the end of December in the same year an operation
was performed, which afforded him such relief that he was enabled to get about and
engage in some of the pursuits which he followed prior to his illness. This seeming
convalescence was so deceptive that his friends became assured of a lengthened
respite, but early in March, 1886, matters again assumed so serious an aspect that
he was confined to his house from that day to the Bth of April, when he breathed
his last. He suffered very little pain, and retained full possession of his mental
faculties up to the last. Mr. Goldsbrough’s name was known throughout Australia
for over 30 years ; he took no active part in public life, coveting neither civic nor
legislative honours, to which his position in the mercantile world entitled him. So
unqualified was his reputation for perspicacity in business that his friends were wont
to say of him that he would as soon have made a bad bargain as have delivered a
platform speech. It can never be said of him that he ever evinced backwardness in
materially assisting any project tor the advancement of the colony, or for the benefit
of the pastoral interest. His benevolent disposition, his abhorrence of all that


savoured of sham, his rectitude and his probity, caused him to he held in universal
esteem and respect, not only among the mercantile but the general community of
Australia. In dispensing charity Mr. Goldsbrough bore in mind the Scriptural
precept—“ Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth,” —nor was his
benevolence confined to the colony in which he lived. The Bradford Observer, in an
article on “ The Australian Wool Trade,” published in May, 1884, says :—“ Mr.
Goldsbrough has never forgotten those whom he left behind him in circumstances
less successful than himself, and it is well known that he has displayed much
generosity in assisting those who had no greater claim to his benevolence than lay in
his reminiscences of olden times. He has also for the past 20 or 30 years given an
annual sum for distribution amongst the poor of Shipley, Windhill, and Baldon.”
Mr. Goldsbrough several times revisited the place of his birth, and in the little
village, according to the same journal, the unique rise and progress of the firm
which he established at the Antipodes is still the subject of constant and admiring
interest. The deceased gentleman was an ardent supporter of the turf, and had
been a steward of the Y.R.C. ever since its foundation. Legitimate horse-racing had
no better friend in Australia. Mr. Goldsbrough was married before his arrival in the
colony, but his wife died six years ago, and was interred in the Kew Cemetery. He
leaves no surviving children, for the issue of his marriage died when very young,
and were buried in the churchyard at Shipley. The children of his brother-in-law,
the late Mr. Hugh Parker, are therefore his nearest relatives. During the last two
years Mr. Goldsbrough gradually relinquished his active supervision of the Melbourne
business.


THE HOIST. JOHN NIMMO, ML. A.; O.E.
these high-strung clays of political-coquetting and self-aggrandisement,
W^ien considered de regeur to offer up incense at the shrine
°t plausibility and charlatanry, when a pandering to some popular
though retrogressive policy ensures the result of a temporary niche in the
history ot the day; when the “high ideal of a noble life ” is totally misunderstood,
a consistent political!, with a hearty fervency in those principles which should really
direct and influence his jiolitical actions, a politician with an earnest and laudable
desire to permanently benefit his country is a rara avis all the more rare in a young
colony subject to the throes of formation of a national and social character, and
conditions and circumstances which force to the front individuals with the capacity
to humor the madness of the moment. Few, if any, are found to fancy the role, of
Nydia, and self-abnegation becomes all but mythical. If, for no other reason, for
his consistency and utter disregard of self, the Honourable John Nimmo deserves
that the waves of time, when they shall have rolled continuously over his name, and
caused the letters in which it is written to have become faint and his biographical
characteristics to have become indistinct, shall have left some monument, which
shall recall to posterity the respect and esteem in which the present member for
Emerald Hill is held.
The Honorable John Nimmo was born at Catrine, in Ayrshire, Scotland, where
he piosecuted his elementary studies. Having decided to follow the profession of a
builder and surveyor, he industriously worked to that end, at the same time
qualifying himself for the duties of a practical engineer. He finished his
mathematical studies in Glasgow, and sailed thence for Victoria in 1853, in
the ship Abdallah. The late Mr. Ebenezer Syme was a fellow-passenger.
Gifted with the qualities of perseverance and energy, Mr. Nimmo, on landing on
Austiahan soil, immediately embraced an opportunity for commencing business on
Ins own account as a contractor, and pursued that calling until the creation of the
municipality of Emerald Hill, when his professional qualifications secured him the
appointment of town surveyor. The able manner in which he discharged the duties
pertaining to that office is evidenced by the fact that to this day the scene of his
labours is regarded as the “ model municipality.” In further recognition of his
mentorious zeal and social worth, he was presented by his fellow-townsmen at a
public meeting with a gold watch and an illuminated address. In August, 1867,
Mr. Nimmo was elected a member of the Emerald Hill Municipal Council, and held
that position lor nine years, twice during which period he was elevated to the mayoral
chair. On vacating the chair in 1871, he was presented with an address, and the


like compliment was paid him in 1873, and also in 1870, when he retired from
the Council. On the 20th June, 1808, he was gazetted a territorial magistrate.
Previous to the appeal to the country on the 11th of May, 1877, when Sir
James M'Culloch and his party experienced such a crushing defeat, a thorough
demoralisation in the Assembly had set in, the whole three sessions of that
Parliament having been devoted to a game of “ outs and ins,” the Opposition
having steadfastly and religiously adhered to the amusement of stonewalling. The
Legislative arena witnessed a scandalous war, not of principles, nor even yet a
conflict of parties, hut a simple contest for personal aggrandisement. Although party
objects ran high, conscientious adherence was woefully lacking, and the House was
not untruthfully stigmatised as idle, disorderly, and factious in the extreme. As a
heaping of Ossa on Pelion, the supineness evinced by electors in matters of public
import was simply incredible, and the obligations of men enjoying the benefits of
free government were totally lost sight of. This was all the more inexplicable when
it is taken into consideration that the ranks of the apathetic in connection with the
exercise of the franchise numbered men who, on the grounds of principle alone,
should have set a good example to their neighbours, and have given the common-
wealth the benefit of their superior judgment and intelligence. The political
horizon at the time was darkened with the probable conflict between capital
and labour, and vested rights and interests were threatened with what was at the
time called “the iniquitous proposal” for the “bursting up” of estates. A
bitter feeling predominated in regard to the existing law anent education, and the
secular system then in vogue was vituperously denounced by a large minority
embracing all denominations, who thought it their duty to enforce their children
being trained in religion from day to day in school: and of this section Sir Charles
Gavan Duffy was the leader. The community at large was more or less swayed by
the expressed opinion of leaders on the important matter of the Customs tariff, and
Protection or Freetrade became the principal planks in the platforms. The
Protectionists, advocating the theory that the existing mode of management
precluded the possibility of the revenue of the country being derived from an-
other source than duties collected at the custom house; and urging that the levying
of such duties necessitated the working man paying his share, which was a
disproportionate one as compared with that of other members of the community
whose resources were greater, but who consumed no larger quantity of the
necessaries of life than his less wealthy neighbours, maintained that a more
equitable arrangement could be arrived at by a heavier imposition on such articles
as were not imperatively necessary to the requirements of life, but which were
nevertheless in demand by the affluent. The raison d'etre of the demoralisation,
however, rested in the fact, that Messrs. Berry, Service, Casey, and Sir Charles
Gavan Duffy were each looking forward to the premiership ; and were engaged in a
game of cross-purposes.
Having synoptically sketched the state of affairs in the beginning of 1871, we
will revert to the subject of this memoir by introducing him to the reader as a
candidate for legislative honors, put forward by the Emerald Hill National Reform
THE HONOURABLE JOHN NIMMO.


and Protection League, in opposition to the Constitutional candidate, Mr. John
Whiteman. The constituency whose suffrage Mr. Nimmo sought under such
favourable circumstances enjoyed the privilege of deputing two representatives to the
Lower House, and no fewer than six candidates faced the constituents for their votes.
Mr. Nimmo was returned at the head of the poll with a large majority. In his
address to the electors of Emerald Hill lie tersely gave expression to his opinions to
the following effect; he had no confidence in the proposed revision of the tariff; he
was averse to any measure that had a tendency to the depreciation of the value of
property, or destruction of public confidence in property which had already
been realised; he was in favour of an equitable law of land taxation based on a
classification of its grazing capabilities; he was opposed to an imposition on town
lands, these being already heavily taxed by corporations and he would he no party to
confound town allotments with agricultural areas; he was strenuously opposed to the
alienation of land; the Mining on Private Property Bill had his unqualified approval;
he would advocate Intercolonial free trade and the abolition of Sunday trading; and
he was totally at variance with the principles of free immigration. No greater proof
of the confidence of his constituency can he offered than the fact that up to the
present time Mr. Nimmo has been returned as member to the Legislative Assembly
no less than five times in succession and at the head of the poll on each occasion.
At the last general election in 1886 having accepted the portfolio of Minister of
Public Works in the Gillies-cum-Deakin administration, the electors showed their
appreciation of his sterling worth by again placing him in his usual proud position.
The Melbourne Harbour Trust had the benefit of his valuable services for
years, as representative of the Government in that body.
In 1878 he was appointed chairman of a Board to enquire into the Water Supply
of Melbourne and suburbs; that Board is still in existence and Mr. Nimmo is still
the chairman. This important subject—water supply—has received his special
attention, and the results attending the labours of the Board are testified by the
improved condition of the supply, by the construction of the Wallaby and Silver
Creek aqueducts and the channels for conveying the streams of the Plenty Ranges in a
clear condition to the Yan Yean reservoir. The report on the introduction of the
Watts River scheme was the last work of the Board and the Government of the day
was so satisfied with its importance and practicability that the Treasurer (Hon. James
Service) caused the sum of £500,000 to he embodied in a loan bill and <£loo,ooo to he
placed on the estimates for its perfection. The contract for the first section of this
important work was let in the latter end of August 1886. The city of Melbourne and
its suburbs, on the completion of this work, will be in the enjoyment of one of the
finest water supplies in the world.
Mr. Nimmo whilst taking an active interest in the temperance movement, has
the discrimination and good taste on no occasion to obtrude his views in an offensive
manner on those who differ with him. His powers of elocution and reasoning
always secure him an attentive hearing, and his suaviter in modo coupled with his
fortiter in re has secured him the popularity of the whole House. His administration
of the Public Works Department is now winning him golden opinions.
THE HONOURABLE JOHN NIMMO.

CJSS^B
P a S es °* Victorian history are scored with the names of those who
have written and are still writing in indelible characters their distinctive
marks across them, and helping to still further solidify the prosperity of
one of the fairest colonies of the world. Each one of these in his own peculiar way
is working to an end, and that end, the glorious realisation of what was half a
century ago a day dream, the forming Victoria into the depot as well as the entrepot
of the Southern Hemisphere. The successive stages of the magical increase and
development of the commercial progress of the colony have been noted from time to
time, and commerce has at last found its level and come to be acknowledged the
backbone of the colony, and the chief prop and mainstay of its settlement and
prosperity. The careers of those who transformed the chateaux cn espagne into reality,
are simply records of labour, and in many instances the labour has been a labour of
love. The expression, “ The native element is growing too overpowering”, very
often grates upon the ear, and the more painfully when it is but too self-evident that
it is the native sculptor who is reducing the chateaux into a fabric of beauty, power,
and life. These sculptors by their own acts are fixing their places in history.
Springing from the people and receiving their education amongst them, they are
daily offering striking examples of the potentialities of life in Australia, and
furnishing irrefragable proofs of the possibilities of achievement by ability and
application, supplemented by the power of directing opportunities into channels with
a laudable and worthy ambition.
Amongst the elements which have been the chief factors of that material
prosperity which marks the Victoria of to-day, is the diversity of industrial enterprise }
and this could not have been more forcibly evidenced than in the immunity which
she enjoyed during the period of depression in 1880 under which the sister colonies
suffered. Through that, and that alone, Victoria was enabled to escape that check to
her progress which was felt chiefly in South Australia, and to a considerable, though
lesser extent, in New South Wales and Queensland. In following the advice of the
propriety of no farmer’s wife carrying all the eggs to market in one basket, but having
more than one prop upon which to lean, she avoided the necessity of a main dependence
on any single one of them, and thus steered through the perilous passage which came
so nearly wrecking the other colonies. A community where the manufacturing
industry is of some importance is better able to bear the strain of depression than
colonies where almost the sole reliance is placed upon grazing and the cultivation of


the soil, since agricultural and pastoral interest may be seriously affected by
unfavourable seasons.
Although the manufacturing industry in Victoria is comparatively in its
infancy, there are now about 8000 factories in the colony, of a capital value of about
111,000,000, employing some 50,000 hands, and paying over 15,000,000 in wages.
Ihe total value of manufactures, including the value of the raw material, is estimated
at about 120,000,000, or equal to the combined value of the agricultural, pastoral, and
mining produce of the colony. In a colony with a proclivity to protection, but where
the principle of protection is not unanimously accejAed, it is needless to state that
opinion is divided as to whether even the above results, which may rightly be
described as marvellous, could not have been greatly enhanced. Without, however,
entering the debateable lists, and arguing the relative merits of freetrade or
pi election, which, after all, aim at the attainment of the same object—the quickest
de\elopment of the resources of the colony,—it can safely be asserted that the figures
show a record of progress which must bring a glow of triumph to every patriotic
bosom, and especially to those of such natives as have materially assisted, despite the
reproach cast upon the class as essentially a cricket, boating and sport-loving
community, to achieve the same. And high in the list which numbers the ambitious
who have not made much of all their little ambitions, who have not crowned
themselves with straw and thought they ruled, who have not set their souls on a
winning horse, a political measure, a policy, a project, or a coup d'etat , but hugged
the ambition which savours of patriotism, stands the name of Frank Stuart.
He was bom at Penrith, New South Wales, in 1844, and received his
commercial training in the soft goods business in Sydney. He came to Victoria in
1866, and was foi fifteen years connected with the firm of Messrs. L. Stevenson and
Sons, of Flindeis Lane, as the manager of the manufacturing branches of their
business. After the severance of his connection with that firm, he undertook the
management, with a partnership, of the firm now well known as that of Lincoln,
Stuart and Co., in Flinders Lane East, clothing manufacturers and warehousemen.
Since his admission the business has rapidly increased, and is now favourably known
as one of the most important of its kind in the colonies. The firm employs three
hundred hands, and pays over ,=£20,000 per annum in wages. Although a liberal
and a protectionist in principle, Mr. Stuart’s political opinions are not of the ultra
type. At a time when it has become manifest that there is nothing in free-trade
principles which should lead their advocates to discourage the establishment of
manufactures on a firm and permanent basis, their objections lying rather in the method
adopted than the result attained, Mr. Stuart opines that the Victorian manufacturers
have arrived at a position when it becomes desirable to extend their markets, and that
to this end reciprocity should be arranged with the other colonics on the basis of
mutual interest and convenience. In fact, his liberal views have always warmly
inclined him to reciprocity and Intercolonial free-trade, and he has ever taken a keen
interest in all legislative matters bearing on commercial questions. Undaunted by
the fiasco in legard to the initiatory attempt with Tasmania respecting reciprocity,


he evinced so much interest in the matter, that it is quite within bounds to state
that the agitation in 1880, in favour of a reciprocal treaty between Queensland and
Victoria, was the outcome of a resolution moved by him in the Chamber of
Manufactures, of which he was president for the year 1885-80. Under his presidency
this institution rapidly gained in influence and power. On the 20th of May, 1880,
Mr. Stuart, on retiring from the presidentship of the Victorian Chamber of
Manufactures, summed up the events of the year in a well-balanced dissertation,
which incontestably stamped him a speaker of no mean order. Having one or two
delicate subjects to touch upon, he skated over them with that tact and discrimination
indicative of an embryo political genius and a born diplomatist. The members of
the Chamber undoubtedly nurture sound ideas on some of the principles of the
doctrine of economics, although the fact of most of them being pre-occupied by the
cares ot business prevents them from devoting much time and attention to theories.
To such as have either the time or inclination to study the subject, Mr. Stuart is
indefatigable in setting out the dense stupidity of men who objected to the Tasmanian
reciprocity treaty, and the extraordinary ignorance that prevails among the masses of
the people upon economical subjects. Mr. Stuart has rendered a service both to
capital and labour in pointing out that many of the provisions in the Factories and
Shops’ Act tended to cripple the industry of the colony. The effect of these, Mr. Stuart
has argued, can always be represented in money which has to be paid for by somebody.
The capitalist, who is master of the manufacturing situation here, will not pay: he
will try to hand the new burthen either to the wage-earner or the consumer, and in
a contest between these it is positive that the former must be the vanquished. Mr.
Stuart is laudably exercised in regard to the lack in finish given by technical
training, in Australian artizans, who, doubtless, are otherwise intelligent, energetic,
and capable, but he very rightly observes—“ There is a measure of roughness in our
productions. We have not yet that delicate art sense which distinguishes the
foreign workman.” And to the encouraging and educating to this “art sense” Mr.
Stuart devotes a deal of thought and enterprise, and warmly advocates the
establishment of technical schools and the adoption of all possible means to raise
the standard of taste and manipulative skill.
Mr. Stuart is now President of the Clothing Manufacturers’ Association and
of the Booroondara branch of the Australian Natives’ Association. One of his
speeches, delivered in the Melbourne Town Hall at a mass meeting of Australian
Natives convened to protest against the French occupancy of the New Hebrides,
occasioned the following remark from the Press: “If you would keep thoroughly
pregnant of the thought of your time and the directions in which it is likely to
incline, it is necessary to watch carefully the men who are likely to lead it,
and especially the developing men who are steadily pressing forward with the
consciousness of having the field marshal’s baton in their knapsacks. The latest
development of coming men is in the person of Mr. Frank Stuart, who is forcing
himself into prominence by the sure and lasting pressure of solid ability. Yet
young, and of attractive personal appearance, this gentleman thinks like a student


ft
<?-,—. ■ • •— tj®
and orates like an elocutionist. His speech at the Natives meetmg anent the
annexation of the New Hebrides, was again and again broken by the tumult
of irrestrainable applause, and his patriotic and well phrased sentiments, set
cultivated modes of expression, which betoken education, thoughtMness a
good judgment, seemed to shine out like suns, around which clustered the
passion and enthusiasm of the meeting. A few more such speeches an ,
will bo a demand for this natural native orator in Parliament, and when theie
he will soon put to shame the gentlemen who address Mr. Speaker with a hum
and a haw and a choke in the throat. _ ,
Mr Stuart is enthusiastic in his advocacy of Federation, and has been
assiduous in encouraging Australian National feeling. He has not yet found time
to enter the political lists, but has interested himself in all public questions tending
to national welfare.

HUGH GEORGE.
recent years the claims frequently made on behalf of the press as to its
I destined influence in superseding the powers of the pulpit and parliament
in advancing the moral and material welfare of humanity, and
disseminating the blessings of civilisation, have come to be more and more
recognised, and the present is considered an age when its potent force as an
educational agent, has brought about that elysian time of freedom of opinion and of
conscience. The highest and most useful results from the practice of Journalism in
forwarding the “march of mind” until very recently, so far, at all events, as the
provincial Press of the Australasian Colonics is concerned, was not attempted, and
that system of check, which has always obtained in every other domain of
professional life to guard against the usurpation of power by the ignorant and
superficial, was altogether ignored, and entrance into the ranks of the body
journalistic was denied to none. In every profession, save the one in question,
safeguards are erected, and in this, which offers the power of scattering error
broadcast, of sowing prejudice, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness, of setting
class against class, and lowering the standard of morality until every degradation,
social or political, becomes possible, no question was ever raised of undeniable
efficiency, or the qualifications which should distinguish a censor of public morals,
or a critic of the actions of the human race. A newspaper may be the noble
disseminator of truths and the most elevated sentiment, or it, on the other hand,
inmht diffuse noxious and detestable doctrines and advocate principles that barely
stop short of bringing ruin to a colony, and dwarfing the intellectual and moral
growth of a community. It is true that in the ranks of the gentlemen who guide
the destinies of the Australasian Press there are many able and high-minded writers,
cultured professional men of high attainments, alive with the instincts of courtesy
and chivalry, but then how many of the newspapers systematically write down to the
level of their lowest readers with the view of securing commercial support or fanning
the political passions of the public. Turning from these and scanning the columns
of the leading metropolitan journals of the Australian Colonies one cannot help
arriving at the conclusion that nowhere in the world, judging relatively to population,
can worthier newspapers be found, than some amongst which the one that had the
subject of this biography identified with it for a quarter of a century, may, without
hesitation be awarded a prominent place.
Mr. Hugh George was a Journalist whose name was known throughout
Australia. He was born in 1822, in Wick, County ol Caithness, Scotland, and began
his career as a pressman in the capacity of a printer’s boy at John o’Groat’s house.


After finishing his time there Mr. George obtained employment as a compositor
on The Times. While so employed he showed such special ability that ho
was transferred to the commercial department of the establishment. After a
connection of fourteen years with The Times, during which, being, of course, in one
of the best of schools, he acquired a great knowledge of newspaper work, he was
engaged by Mr. Lauchlan Mackinnon, one of the proprietors of The Argus, to come
to Melbourne and take charge of the printing department of that paper. At the
time Mr. Higinbotham (now Mr. Justice Higinbotham), filled the editorial chair, and
in a letter recently written by him to a Sydney journalist he expresses himself thus,
in relation to his connection with the subject of this paper: —‘‘I think it was in the
year 1856, that Mr. George and I first became acquainted. It was about that time
that Mr. George came out from The Times office, London, to take charge of the
mechanical arrangements of The Argus newspaper, of which I was then the editor.
Prior to his arrival there was discontent and trouble in the printing department of
the paper, which involved much anxiety and additional and longer labor in the
editor’s branch. I well-remember the extraordinary and instantaneous effect
produced by Mr. George. Thoroughly acquainted with his business, he at once
ascertained the causes of discontent; he readily yielded to the demands of the
printers which he found to be just, and by mingled firmness and moderation, guided
by consummate discretion, he at once restored order, discipline, and contentment,
which were never afterwards disturbed during the time I was connected with the
paper. In a few days after his arrival some of us in the editor’s department were
enabled, through his aid, to go home from our work at 1, 2, or 3 o’clock in the
morning, instead of at 4, 5, 6, and even as late as 7 o’clock, the hours we had for
some time previously. My first feelings therefore towards Mr. George were those of
high respect and a sense of official and personal obligation. They became
stronger as daily intercourse made us better acquainted, and I have always had a
lively pleasure in believing that our friendship was not interrupted even for a
moment when long afterwards it became my painful duty to have Mr. George
committed to the custody of the Sergeant-at-arms, for a contempt of the Legislative
Assembly, committed by him as the publisher of The Argus. I should not omit to
state that The Argus, under Mr. George was the first Victorian newspaper to acquire
the appearance and arrangement of matter that distinguish a first-class London
newspaper.”
As to the episode of the committal of Mr. George to the custody of the
sergeant-at-arms, it may be stated that it occurred during an exciting political period
in the history of the colony. The Argus offended the ruling party in the Legislative
Assembly of the day, and Mr. George, being the publisher, was summoned to the
bar, and, as mentioned by Mr. Higinbotham, was committed to the custody of the
sergeant-at-arms. He was detained a State prisoner until the end of the session,
when the power of the House ceased.
In 1870, Mr. George was appointed general manager of The Argus and The
Australasian on the death of Mr. J. C. King. It was during his term of office that


the Australasiaii SJcetclier was started. His innate aptitude for newspaper management
rendered responsibilities which would have seemed large to any other, a matter of
ordinary moment to him. His tact with compositors enabled him to so deal with
them, that they always found in him a staunch friend. He established a sick fund
m connection with the mechanical branch of The Argus which still exists. He was
hi ought into intimate association with public men, and many of the leading litterateurs
not only of Victoria, but of Australia; and he secured the respect and regard of all
with whom he was brought into contact. He was gentle and kind not only in aspect
and demeanor, but in disposition. The personal welfare of all who laboured under
him was made his special study, and such was the estimate of his worth that all who
had business relations with him felt intuitively that he was a man whose word could
be relied upon, and who had a just and equitable spirit. After holding the
managership of The Argus for about eight years, and being identified with that journal
loi neai] y a quarter ot a century, he resigned to take advantage of a flattering offer
that he received from the Messrs. Fairfax, proprietors of the Sydney Morning Herald
v\ith which The Argus had long maintained, and still maintains, relations of the
most c Ol dial nature, so that for Mr. George the change hardly amounted to severance
with the pressmen of Melbourne, who had become intimate with him. In 1878,
Mi. Geoige was inducted into the general managership of the Sydney Morning Herald,
and from the date of installation to within a few days of his death his remarkable
aptitude lor managing the mechanical department of a great newspaper was as much
appaient as it was at any earlier period ot his career. There his ability was as wisely
exeicised, his constant endeavour to promote, as far as could be done, the best
interests of all who worked with him as conspicuous as they were here. Though a
thorough martinet when dealing with carelessness or incapacity, he was ever ready
to acknowledge a zealous performance of duty and the just claims of the humblest
employe were as sacred to him as those of the proprietors. Inside the office he was
gieatly esteemed, and outside he was universally respected. His thorough insight
and experience of journalism entitled him to take a prominent position in Sydney
among journalists, but the position accorded to him wherever he was present as a
representative of the newspaper press was from the first one of the highest.
On the 13th of May, 1880, Mr. George arrived in Melbourne from Sydney,
and took up his quarters at the Australian Club, having undertaken the journey for a
rest from arduous toil, and a change. The journey had almost prostrated him and
on the following morning he consulted Hr. Neild, who found him suffering from
advanced heart-disease, and prescribed for him. About two o’clock that afternoon
Mr. George had a fainting fit. Mr. L. C. Mackinnon, general manager of The Argus,
being at the club and seeing his critical condition, sent for Hr. Neild again, and also
for Mr. Peter Yeo, son-in-law of Mr. George. Hr. Jamieson was also called in. The
attack was, however, a fatal one; and Mr. George, after remaining for some time in a
semi-conscious state, died about half-past six in the evening. The announcement of
his death caused the deepest distress to all who knew him. Until the last fatal attack
of illness, neither Mr. George nor any of his friends had the least idea that his end
HUGH GEOEGE.


•was so near. Indeed, lie had arranged with the proprietors ot the Sydney Morning
Herald that he should as soon as possible have a prolonged leave of absence, to enable
him to visit the old country. He has left a wife, three sons, and three daughters.
On Saturday morning, the 15th of May, the remains of the deceased gentlemen were
conveyed from the Australian Chib, to the residence of Mr. Peter Yeo, at Hawthorn,
where a large number of friends attended to pay their respects. The body was
enclosed in a leaden casket and a beautiful oak coffin, and removed on the morning
of the 17th, to the Spencer Street railway station, in order to be conveyed to Sydney;
where, on arrival, it was interred at the Waverley Cemetery, on the afternoon of the
18th May, 1886. The remains were followed by a large cortege, and amongst those
present, were Sir Patrick Jennings, the Hon. G. R. Hibbs, and representatives of
nearly all the metropolitan newspapers. The service at the , grave was read by the
Rev. W. Hough, and this was followed by members of the Sydney Liedertafel (of
which the deceased had been Vice-President) singing a chorale from Mendelssohn’s
oratorio, “St. Paul,” and afterwards contributing Sullivan’s part song, “The Long
Hay Closes.”
Mr. George was widely known and respected, both for his ability and his virtues;
but his worth was best appreciated by those to whom he was a fellow laborer and a
friend. His death was a matter of deep sorrow to his immediate associates, and to a
large circle of friends.

Nathaniel Levi J,P,


NATHANIEL LEYI.
above name, which for many years has been intimately and actively
fJjH associated with the progress of Victoria, is one which finds a worthy place
i A/Msu in these memoirs. Not only has Mr. Levi taken a large share in the
political questions of his time, but he is well and favourably known as a man of
enterprise in the commercial world—one who has embarked in several adventures for
the development of the resources of the colony, as the somewhat varied incidents in
his career amply testify.
Mr. Levi was born of Jewish parents, at Liverpool, England, on the 20th
January, 1830, and is consequently in his 57th year. His elementary education w r as
acquired at a school where denominationalism was unknown, for boys of all classes and
creeds were taught there. At an early age Mr. Levi had special opportunities of being
associated with many well-known mercantile men in that famous and historic seaport
town, Liverpool—one of England’s nurseries of commerce and entrepots of wealth.
Although as yet of “tender years/’ Mr. Levi exhibited, if not a precocious, still a
lively interest in public questions, particularly parliamentary and municipal, a know-
ledge of which stood him in good stead in after years, and in another land.
On the 4th of December, 1853, the subject of this sketch left England for the
golden shores of Victoria, attracted thither by the glowing accounts of a colonial
El Dorado, which caused thousands to alter the current of their lives in this direction.
There is an ever-present charm to old shipmates as they read of bygone days, when
they first trod a ship’s deck, and took their first eventful voyage on life’s material
ocean. This may be our plea for recording the fact that the name of the vessel that
bore Mr. Levi from his youthful home was the Matilda Wattenbach, that Captain
Clare was her navigator, and that after a stormy passage the Port of Lisbon was
made, where a detention of six weeks was necessary for repairs, arriving at Melbourne
on the 27th April, 1854. From this time a new vista opened before our youthful
colonist. The bright dreams of home are seldom realized abroad. “Distance lends
enchantment to the view,” truly, and but too often the mental view we take of men
and things, at long range, is seldom so satisfactory on their near approach. Dis-
appointments, however, are more often for our good than we can instantly recognize.
They may appal the craven spirit, but they nerve the arm of enterprise and
strengthen self-reliance. When Mr. Levi landed he found that the gold fever had
somewhat abated, and, probably as a consequence, trade, and matters generally, were
not lively. Nothing daunted, he set manfully to work, and, having decided on
the “general business” line, rented a tenement about sixteen feet square in Collins-
street, at the modest rental of fourteen pounds sterling a week ! This was a portion


of the block presently occupied by the Bank of New South Wales, but was soon
after exchanged for a site at the corner of Collins and Queen streets, where the
English and Scottish Bank has recently been erected. Here the business of auctioneer
was carried on until the year 1858, when Mr. Levi visited the goldfields, and joined
a firm of wine, spirit, and general merchants, having large connections in Melbourne
and Maryborough, and trading under the name of John Levy and Sons. We may
assume that commercial success followed in the wake of Mr. Levi’s energies, for we
now find him signalized by the crowd, and regarded as a “fit and proper person
to represent the Maryborough constituency in parliament. But political success,
though near, was not yet achieved, for at the general election in 1859 the candidate
was defeated by fourteen votes. Often a political defeat may be regarded as a
philosophical victory ; and Mr. Levi, though temporarily vanquished, was warranted
in trusting his friends to pull him through another contest, which was not long
a-coming. Between that date and December, 1860, the time had been well employed
in promulgating his own views and making himself master of those entertained by his
constituents, so that when Mr. Richard Davies Ireland accepted the Attorney-
Generalship in the first Heales’ administration an opportunity was afforded Mr. Levi
to contest the vacant seat with the new minister, which he did successfully, heading
the poll by a majority of 166 votes. One more step having been ascended on
ambition’s ladder was one more advantage gained, while it was an emergence from
the peaceful pursuits of mercantile life to the more exhilarating and boisterous arena
of political and party strife. It is stating the case mildly to say that Mr. Levi’s
conquest was as satisfactory to his friends as it was discomfiting, if not actually
distasteful, to his enemies. It was probably not so much deplored that Mr. Ireland
was defeated as that Mr. Levi was the victor and carried the honours intended for
another. It was the individual, and not the principle, that constituted the grievance.
But the victory, signal as it was, was not all expressed in the one act of election.
There were other victories of equal significance and magnitude. Mr. Levi had
triumphed over the prejudices of caste; he teas the only candidate that successfully
opposed the re-election of ministers who went back to their constituents after
accepting office, whilst the mortification of defeat was the more intolerable since the
Attorney-General was regarded as the only minister in the newly-formed adminis-
tration acquainted with office. Nor was this all: Mr. Levi had the pride of place in
that he was the first Jew that had been returned to the Victorian Parliament. On
his induction the new member for Maryborough was escorted and presented to
the Speaker by Messrs. King and Carr, M.L.A.’s, and having been sworn on the
Old Testament, with head covered, according to Jewish ceremony, Mr. Levi took
his seat on the second bench, immediately below the gangway. To such an extent
was this jealous and otherwise hostile demonstration carried that a projected banquet
to the newly elected had to be abandoned in consequence, although on many subse-
quent occasions his fellow Judaists have fully testified to the value of Mr. Levi’s
services. Mr, Levi had won his spurs, and had gone through his baptism of
political fire. Contested elections in those days were “ circumstances ” to be
remembered, —that at Maryborough being no exception. It is held to have been


the most riotous that had been witnessed in the colony-—a kind of colonial Donny-
brook. Rioting, free-fighting, upsetting vehicles, pistol shooting, and other
amiable devices were resorted to in general, while at the polling booth double voting
and personation were rife; and to such a pitch were matters carried that after
escaping a revolver discharge, fired through the window of his committee room,
Mr. Levi had to be escorted from the township by a number of police and private
citizens, or personal violence would have resulted, so great was the disappointment at
the result of the polling. Amongst many actions associated with his name was
the initiation of a movement in aid of the funds of two synagogues, the success
of which enabled the heavy liabilities on the buildings to be partly paid off. He was
also unanimously elected President of the Melbourne Hebrew congregation, and the
Melbourne Hebrew school, an office he held for some years, and in the discharge of
the duties of which he gave such general satisfaction that, on resigning, a presentation
of a very handsome service of silver plate was made to him, accompanied by an
illuminated address expressive of the esteem in which he was held.
Proceeding chronologically, we find Mr. Levi taking his stand in the people’s
forum of his adopted country with that determination to succeed which is charac-
teristic of his race. The pages of “Hansard,” as well as the contemporary press, are
proofs of this. He identified himself most zealously with mercantile interests, but not
at the expense of other questions, in which, probably, his own or other constituencies
had more interest than himself. His speeches on the Budget and Tariff bills were
acknowledged to be based on sound, practical data. Uniform in his views, Mr. Levi
was not of the class known as “ shifty.” Well-established principles had his support
first, and “ newfangled ideas ” second; but he was ever open to conviction, and a
staunch combatant for the maintenance of what he thought right, let it be new or old.
His maiden speech in the Assembly was opposed to the payment of members, in
which it may be said by some that he displayed more courage than discretion. But
he regarded, and probably still regards, that question as having a demoralizing effect
on some candidates, whose scruples speedily kick the beam if a multitude of promises,
at election , to perform any number of impossible feats, if elected , would secure to them
the much-coveted honorarium. Mr. Levi, still holding to the allegiance of his youth,
would have been invaluable in the Assembly of to-day in expressing his views upon
the only piece of legislation on which there was a singular unanimity of “ ayes ”
the Payment of Members Bill. The abolition of the gold export duty was a powerful
argument with Mr. Levi, who twitted the Government with distributing amongst
members money harshly wrung from the hands of industry; and he ultimately had
the satisfaction of witnessing its repeal. The Inglewood Advertiser, in its issue of sth
April, 1861, thus refers to the prevailing opinion of the miners in regard to those
who opposed the abolition of this duty:—“A full-sized effigy of the M.L.A. who
was so popular here a short time since, hangs m Oommercial-street, with placards
bearing the following inscription :— ‘ Here we are 1 The lobby sneaks—Grant,
Macadam, Houston, Chapman, Praser, Woods.’ The name of Levi, in large letters, is
surrounded by the words 1 Honour to whom honour is due. Mr. Levi supported
the passing of the Torrens Act, which is now familiarized with the cheap and


expeditious transfer of land. He also carried a Bill through the House to facilitate
transfers of mercantile instruments and securities, but the measure was rejected by
the Council, though some years afterwards it became law. The establishment of a
mint he took great interest in; the framing of liberal land laws; abolition of
pensions to Ministers of the Crown; insolvency laws; abolition of tea and sugar
duties; increased rentals from squatters; taxing uncultivated lands ; and not amongst
the least meritorious of his actions was the passing of a resolution in the House
to secure a reserve of land for a line of railway from Castlemaine to Maryborough.
After five years’ occupancy Mr. Levi was ousted from the mining representation, but
he successfully contested the East Melbourne seat, being placed at the top of the poll
by a substantial majority. Peace and war appeared to alternate in Mr, Levi’s
career. Words of eulogy on parting, in one quarter, were followed by blows of
anger in another. On his defeat, before alluded to, the Maryborough Advertiser of
17th January, 1866, publishes the following panegyric:—“ The unanimous vote of
thanks passed by the Borough Council last evening to N. Levi, Esq., sufficiently
indicates the estimation in which that gentleman is held by a portion of the com-
munity capable of appreciating the value of public services efficiently performed,
and we are justified in saying that the excitement of the election having cooled
down, it is admitted by those who were strongest in support of the ministerial
party, and therefore opposed to Mr. Levi, that in the rejection of that gentleman the
district has suffered an irreparable loss. Mr, Levi’s consistency, assiduity in pro-
viding for local wants, and careful, business-like attention to the details of every
matter brought under his notice, earned for him the thanks of the constituency,
and it is with sincere regret we have to announce the loss of his valuable
services in a legislative capacity.” But what a change the succeeding picture
presents ! Only one meeting anterior to the East Melbourne election was
held, on account of its boisterous character. All the rowdyism that charac-
terized the Maryborough election was re-enacted thereat, excepting the
revolver episode. Benches were smashed, windows broken, and missiles thrown
about profusely, this being the recognized prescriptive method employed by some
in their demonstrations of party feeling. However, “ All’s well that ends well.”
Mr. Levi gained another victory, and could afford to regard complaisantly the conse-
quences of conduct for which he was not responsible. On the dissolution of Parlia-
ment in 1868, Mr. Levi was for a second time the “rejected candidate,” through
unwisely coalescing with another candidate, and the display of a certain amount of
treachery, which even that alleged political panacea, the ballot box, cannot prevent.
Not having been “ encumbered ” with political honours during the last eighteen years,
Mr. Levi has confined his attention exclusively to business matters, and devoted the
best energies of his matured life to the work that lay more immediately before him.
Lmce 1809 he has been associated with an enterprising effort to open up the coal-
fields at Cape Paterson, from which 2,000 tons of coal have been raised at con-
siderable outlay, and he has never swerved from the opinion that efficient means of
transit are the only desiderata required to make Victoria self-supporting in the item
of coal. Though other speculators have held aloof, Mr. Levi has shown his own


confidence in the work by expending upwards of £7,000 in its prosecution. Some
half-million tons of the fuel have been pierced by the diamond drill within an area
of sixty acres. The cultivation of beet-root, with a view to the production of sugar
and spirits therefrom, has also enlisted Mr. Levi’s active sympathy. In 1864 he
started a distillery at Footscray, and succeeded in producing a pure spirit, for
which he obtained Letters Patent. The manufacture of sugar from beet, by
maceration, immersion, extraction, and evaporation, necessitated an expenditure of
capital amounting to £i 0,000, and at the end of 1871 the scene of operations was
removed to the Anakies. The capital at command . proved inadequate to a
continued prosecution of this industry ; but Mr. Levi had the satisfaction of
receiving gold medals from England and the Melbourne Exhibition Commissioners ;
and from Vienna, one of the great sugar-beet centres of Europe, a medal of merit.
The sugar was sold at an average of £3O a ton, and the spirits at 4s. 6d. a gallon,
about £4,000 going to the Government by way of excise. Mr. Levi is the author of
a book, in which he strongly advocates the suitableness of sugar-beet to colonial
cultivation. Some time ago Mr. Levi obtained along lease of the right to advertise
on the government railways in Victoria ; and that business is now carried on, on an
extensive scale, by him and his sons, in Flinders-street. A restless desire to
embark on new projects, and to supply an apparent public want, led to a bid for
public favour by entering the lists as a competitor in the Fourth Estate. Mr. Levi,
however, depended too much, for a man of his years and varied experience, on promises
of support. Few journals succeed on so frail a platform, and the Daily News, which
was launched in October, 1885, brought its short voyage to an end in a couple of
months, after an expensive outlay which would have disheartened many less self-
reliant men. Not so the man before us. He is made of sterner stuff’; but, although
in colonial life the Roman proverb, Ne sutor ultra crepidam, does not do to be
followed too literally, an occasional departure from its precept may bring us the
wisdom that experience only can teach. Mr. Levi is a widower, having lost his wife
in 1864, a calamity which had a considerable share in the prostration of his energies
for a time; and which, doubtless, altered the whole course and tenor of his life.
He has two surviving sons, who give promise of being his most worthy successors
when he shall have passed away. At the time of our writing it affords the
biographer pleasure to state that Mr. Levi’s hale, hearty physique, as he is daily
seen “ where men most do congregate,” indicates many years before the lease of
life expires.
Mr. Levi, in addition to the many prominent public positions which he
occupies, is a Justice of the Peace for the Central Bailiwick of the colony, and
a Trustee of the Chamber of Manufactures, which is one of the most important
bodies of commerce in the colony, and one of the most numerous in members.

ME. GEOE6B STEVENSON.
s^a^esinan who has rendered valuable services in affairs of state, who
'A i has initiated necessary reforms, who has so administered the government
as to confer benefits upon his fellow-countrymen, is destined to live in
history as a benefactor of the human race. Yet powerless is the statesman, and futile
the efforts of the philosopher, unless co-operation is accorded by an intelligent and
appreciative constituency, comprising men of tact, energy, and perseverance in all the
departments of life. The successful man of business is an absolute necessity in a
progressive country. His absence is proof positive that decay has set in, and that
national decadence is fast approaching. While it is true that an originator of
commercial enterprises benefits himself, he at the same time confers corresponding
advantages by furnishing employment and utilizing capital in various channels by
which it is distributed. The development of the resources of a country depends
primarily upon the forethought, prudence and energy of her citizens.
Mr. George Stevenson, the subject of the following memoir is a partner
in the firm of L. Stevenson and Sous, manufacturers and warehousemen, of INo. 14
Flinders-lane east, Melbourne. From the influence which he has exerted in
fostering and extending the business from its incipiency he may with justice be classed
amongst the successful business men of Victoria. Such men well deserve the credit
due to the proud pre-eminence which Melbourne holds as a commercial centre,
without a rival in the Southern Hemisphere. From a very early date in colonial
history the name Stevenson has been closely identified with the mercantile and
shipping interests of the Australian colonies. So far back as 1827 (fifty years
ago) Mr, Stevenson’s father, a merchant, commenced the shipping trade between
London and Tasmania, and in 1846 he sent out his eldest son, Mr. Leader
Cox Stevenson, to superintend his interests there. Mr. George Stevenson,
who was born at Clapham near London, in 1831, had at this time just
finished his education, partly at Mill Hill, where he had as a schoolfellow one
who subsequently became distinguished in colonial history—namely, Sir Henry
Barkly, one of the most popular and highly esteemed Governors of Victoria. On
leaving school Mr. Stevenson took a position in the office of his father for the
purpose of acquiring a thorough and intimate knowledge of commercial affairs. Such
was the rapidity of his progress that it was soon deemed advantageous to open a
branch of the business in New South Wales. When gold was discovered in Victoria,
about the year 1851, Mr. Stevenson determined to proceed to Australia, sub-
sequently sailing in the Roman Emperor for Sydney, where he arrived in 1852.
After remaining in Sydney a few weeks he proceeded to Hobart Town to take charge

of the business, his elder brother having returned to England. In the following
year a branch business was opened in Melbourne, under the management of Mr,
John Morris, which prospered, in conjunction with the branches in the other colonies, to
such an extent that from that date the members of the firm of L. Stevenson and Sons
have been regarded as amongst the merchant princes of Melbourne, whose emporiums
cover wide areas, whose capital represents vast sums, whose employes are numbered
in hundreds, and whose palatial residences are amongst the finest in the city. At the
time the Melbourne branch was opened the leading firms were Messrs, Sargood,
Banks Bros, and Henderson, and others, the styles of which firms have since
changed. Mr. Stevenson remained in Hobart Town until 1859, when he proceeded
to Europe. On his return to Australia he selected Melbourne as a permanent
place of residence, and soon after began the erection of the capacious structure in
Flinders-lane in which the business has since been conducted. The premises are
amongst the most commodious in the city. Mr. Stevenson may fairly lay claim to
having initiated the era of gigantic warehouses, which has since in a marked degree
contributed to the commercial supremacy of the capital of Victoria. In the year
1864 he took a new departure in the business and inaugurated the manufacture
of clothing upon an extensive scale, through Messrs. Harris and Heymanson, thus
furnishing employment to the working classes and imparting a stimulant to the
spirit of self-reliance which has since made Victoria the premier manufacturing
colony south of the line. Since then Mr. Stevenson struck out into the hat
manufacturing industry, his firm being now sole proprietors of the Denton Hiat
Mills, Collingwood, which gives employment on the average to 170 hands; and this
is one of the few hat manufactories which can systematically work out regular
profits. They do an immense and growing business, and have for manager an
excellent man in Mr. Shaw, whom the Messrs. Stevenson imported from England.
Naturally inclining to the Cobden school of free-trade, his opinions were sought
upon matters of commercial importance, and in consequence he was selected as
vice-president of the Free-trade League. During the regime of the first M'Culloch
Ministry and when Sir Charles Darling was Governor of the colony he took a
strong stand against the tacking-on of the tariff clause to the Appropriation Bill,
How the Legislative Council threw out the bill as sent up by the Legislative
Assembly, and the subsequent stratagems by which judgments were secured in the
Supreme Court by State creditors, will be found more fully treated of in another
memoir of this volume. At this critical period in the history of the colony Mr.
Stevenson paid certain Customs duties under protest and subsequently proceeded
against the Crown in an action at law. His views were sustained and he obtained
a judgment for £6,000, together with costs. Since the recall of Sir Charles
Darling, Mr, Stevenson has not taken a very prominent part in public affairs. In
1872 he was President of the Chamber of Commerce, and in the retiring address he
startled some people by stating that the gold-mining industry was unprofitable.
The newspapers took up the subject with warmth, not liking to admit such a
doctrine, but Mr. Stevenson, nevertheless, had many supporters who bore out his
assertion that there was not sufficient yield of gold in the colony to pay for all the
MR. GEORGE STEVENSON.


wages of labour, the wear and tear of machinery, and the interest on the outlay for
the plant. For about twenty-five years Mr. Stevenson has been a trustee of the
Melbourne Savings Bank. In 187G, an assistant in the employment of Mr.
Stevenson having been dismissed, charged his late employer with having made
use of duplicate invoices for the purpose of passing goods through the Customs
at less than their actual value. In consequence of this information the Collector
of Customs at Melbourne attempted to seize certain articles in Mr. Stevenson’s
warehouse. The entrance of the official was resisted and violence was resorted
to upon both sides and a protracted law-suit was the result. The Crown
discovered that the evidence in its possession was insufficient to secure a conviction,
while an action brought by Mr. Stevenson against the Collector of Customs for
unlawful and forcible entry upon his premises was unsuccessful. Ultimately the
contest resolved itself into a drawn battle and the legal proceedings were allowed
to lapse. Mr. Stevenson suffered only in a pecuniary sense, as the general verdict
was that the prosecution was the outcome of malice. Mr. Stevenson, while seeking
his own advancement in life, has not forgotten the consideration that is due to the
progress of the city; he has not been oblivious of the fact that the people of
Melbourne are the builders-up of their own good fortune and success. He can
have no more gratifying reminiscences in the decline of life than the fact that he has
materially assisted in the commercial development of a great colony; that his efforts
have been successfully devoted to the moral advancement and personal comfort of
those whom he has employed. Reputations such as that possessed by Mr.
Stevenson form the basis of our commercial prosperity, the key-stone of our
commerce and the most powerful incentive to integrity.


JAMES CASSIUS WILLIAMSON.
Wfl Sln connection with the strenuous efforts that have of late years been made
El cnirc V rencuvs to leave nothing undone that would conduce to the
establishment ot the assertion that, so far from demoralising, the stage
has a tendency to elevate, must be mentioned the name of Mr. Williamson, who, in
conjunction with his two partners, has proved his confidence in the intelligence of
the general public by expending something like £50,000 in the fittings of a theatre,
which has been acknowledged by experts a thorough gem.
James Cassius Williamson (a member of the firm of Williamson, Garner and
Musgrove) is a native of Pennsylvania, U.S., but passed his early youth in the more
western States. He is the son of a well-known physician, now deceased, in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and it was shortly after the death of his father that Williamson
—then only about 12 years of age —first visited the theatre, and becoming,
like many another youth, “ stage-struck,” determined to try his fortune thereon.
Those who have any practical acquaintance with theatrical matters are well aware
that when first the ascent of the ladder is begun, there are many slips and hesitating
steps which can only be overcome and remedied by obstinate pluck, dauntless energy,
and unwearying zeal and attention to every detail connected with the business
such was his experience. After a short attempt at histrionic life he was obliged to
return to school for a few years, but the old craving asserting itself, he once more
determined to make the stage his profession, and managed to obtain a fresh
engagement in a travelling company, in which his duties were multifarious, ranging
from prompter to scenic artist. Though at first adverse to Williamson continuing
his stage career, his guardian—seeing that the young one was determined—gave
him some excellent advice, which should be thoroughly taken to heart by every
young beginner in any walk of life. He said:—“ One thing, however, my lad, I
would impress upon you most firmly, and that is, make it a point to rise at least one
rung up the ladder every year. Ho not sit down on the ground in the hope that
someone will come along and hoist you to the top on his shoulders. Your own
exertions, rung by rung, will alone land you where you can take your rest ;
and, remember, whatever you attempt, do it to the best of your ability.” “ This
advice,” says Williamson, “ I have always endeavoured to follow.” Then
commenced the battle of life. Crossing over to Canada, he played there for one
year, and was accorded a substantial benefit. Thence he went to Wallack’s
Theatre, New York, then the leading theatre of America, and having the finest
company in the world, being, as a legitimate school for acting, only equalled by the
Theatre Francaise, Paris. Here Mr. Williamson remained for seven years, gradually


working his way into a foremost position, and becoming through his genial manner
and his undoubted ability such a favourite as made him the envy ot all the young
actors in New York. So thoroughly proficient, indeed, did he become, that he
was afterwards engaged to succeed the celebrated John Raymond, at the California
Theatre, San Francisco, as “leading comedian.” It was at this theatre that he
first met Miss Maggie Moore, then playing soubrette parts, and a great public
favorite.
They played the lovers together,
They were leading lady and gent;
At last they played it in earnest,
And straight to the church they went.
Such actually was the case, for they were married in February, 1873.
Henceforth was Mr. Williamson to be assisted and counselled by one whose career
is so intimately associated with his, that it is difficult to separate the history of one
from the other. Bright and winning as an actress, and adorned with all the gifts of
a true and loving wife, Mrs. Williamson has been with him through all his
experiences, sharing with him his successes and his triumphs, and proving that
“bright guiding star” which has assuredly had a large influence in leading him
on to fame and fortune. But to our point. Towards the end of 1874, Mr. Williamson
determined to make a tour round the world, and before bidding good-bye boldly
stated that within three years he would be playing as a “ star in London. There
were some sceptics, but far more on the contrary who fully believed that his assertion
would be fulfilled. That such was the case may be judged from the following
account taken from an American paper :
Thirty-five thousand miles of steady and deliberate travel, a minute inspection of the continents,
six hundred and five nights of acting, and all in three years ! This sounds like a story-hook statement
—a romance of Jules Verne. Yet it is an accurate and brief epitome of the energetic caieer, since 18/4,
of Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Williamson. These talented artists left San Francisco in 1874, and first visited
the Sandwich Islands, where they played to curious audiences. Hence they went to Australia, having
made arrangements with Mr. Coppin to come out on “ starring terms. They took with them an
excellent repertoire, including the Koh-i-noor of domestic dramas, “ Struck Oil, and opening in that
piece in the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, August 1, 1874. Their success will be a matter of histor}, as
no play ever gained such lasting favour as “ Struck Oil, nor any characters such enduring appieciation
as John and Lizzie Stofel. After playing phenomenally successful seasons in Melbourne and Sydney,
and netting £15,000 during their fifteen months’ sojourn, they proceeded to India, via Ceylon,
and arrived at Bombay in time to see the arrival of the Prince ot Wales. At Calcutta success again
awaited them. So on to Egypt, and away again to England, where, at the Adelphi Theatre, London,
from Easter Monday, 1877, they played to enthusiastic audiences for two hundred niyhts.
Business now gave way to pleasure, and away went the energetic actor and
his wife to France, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium and Holland. They then went on a
provincial tour, playing in Dublin, Glasgow, Liverpopl, Birmingham and Manchester,
and then right back to San Francisco, where they again appeared in “ Struck
Oil.” That they were not forgotten in their absence, and the way in which they
were welcomed home, may be gathered from the following excerpt of a local paper:—
“ Nothing like the reception of the Williamsons has been seen in the Californian


Theatre since the welcoming home of Edwin Adams. The house was densely packed
in every part, and long even before the curtain rose the eager desire of the vast
multitude to do honour to the Williamsons was plainly apparent. When they did
appear a perfect hurricane of congratulatory cheering set in, which could not be
stilled sufficiently to allow the play to proceed for nearly five minutes, and it broke
out again and again all through the evening.” They subsequently played a two
years’ engagement throughout America in the evergreen “ Struck Oil,” hut thirst
for travel again came upon Mr. Williamson, and he determined to make another tour
round the world. They sailed for Australia in June, 1879,
It is needless now to follow in detail the brilliant career of this gentleman.
In Australia, he received such a kind reception and such a measure of support that
instead of remaining for one year and continuing his tour, as originally intended, he
determined to make the land of the “ Southern Cross” his home. During the time
that Mr. Williamson was producing his pieces, Messrs. Arthur Garner and George
Musgrove were also the managers of separate theatres, and it was deemed advantageous
that an amalgamation should take place. Accordingly the now existing powerful firm
of Williamson, Garner and Musgrove was formed. The Theatres Eoyal in Melbourne
and Sydney, and the Princess Theatre in the former city were leased, and operations
were carried on upon an extended scale. Actors and public have alike benefited by
the coalition management. Since the amalgamation the firm have retained the leases
of the Theatres Royal, in Melbourne and Sydney; have pulled down the old
Princess Theatre in Melbourne, and erected a magnificent structure, called the
“New Princess’s,” which is regarded as one of the most complete theatres in
the world, being replete with all modern improvements; have leased the Theatre
Royal, Adelaide; and have generally vastly extended their field of operations.
It must not be supposed that Mr. Williamson’s success is entirely the result
of luck, or that it has been attained as a “one part” actor, as during his career he has
played almost every line of business. Shakesperian roles, varying from Macduff to
Touchstone and Dogberry, come within his category ; the leading comedy parts in
the old English comedies have been played by him, and he has been foremost in
sensational drama and burlesque, and in every class of dialect parts, including Irish,
German, Scotch, Yorkshire, Somersetshire, Cockney, French, Yankee, Chinese,
Negro and Indian. Indeed, he is so fond of acting that his principal regret at the
present time is that he is so tied down with his managerial duties as to make it
impossible for him to find time to endeavour to create new roles in the manner
to which he was accustomed in former years.
A description here of the “ New Princess’s,” the latest and greatest
enterprise of the firm, would, we think, be apropos : —
“The new theatre, built by Messrs. Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove, is one
of the few places of public amusement in Australia with any pretentions to
architectural style. Viewed from either angle, the facade of the building loses
something in magnitude by the fact that three columns, the main feature of the
front elevation, are at such line of sight brought close together; but standing


immediately in front, the width of the recesses becomes apparent, and then only a
correct idea is obtained of the real size of the building. The style of architecture is
Italian renaissance, with the detail light and generally symmetrical. In the design
there are occasional suggestions of the French style in architecture, a departure from
rule excused by the detail of the interior of the theatre. From Parliament-place the
ground slopes sharply towards the city, and with the object of mounting it up, the
three pillars terminate in mansard pyramidal domes, with crests of cast iron scroll
work resting on pedestals formed by tablets of polished bluestone. The domes are
tiled with brown and grey slates worked into an ornamental design. The piers of
the lower storey are of Malmsbury bluestone, with bases and caps of Doric pattern.
The main entrance is a closed portico in the centre of the facade, this necessary
feature in a theatre governing very largely the design of the whole building. It
compelled the recessing of the front wall, and, as a consequence, room was left
between the central pillar and those flanking it for two wide balconies, beautifully
tiled and protected by massive balustrading. In front of each balcony are pedestals
for electric light standards. The bays correspond closely with the main building,
the tetrastyle or four-column portico being formed of Corinthian pillars, two in each
recess, with pedestals of the same order. The frieze of the cornice, or what would
be more intelligibly described by a general observer as the topmost band of the front
elevation, is festooned with successive laurel wreaths and sprays, and surmounted
with Jupiter statue caps. The ornamental mouldings of the front of the building
are a nicely-modelled figure of the goddess or herald Fame, flanked on either side by
lions couchant, while immediately underneath the statue appears the British coat-of-
arms in relief. The front windows are of somewhat unique design, the label-heads
being broken with scrolls very tastefully designed, and suggesting in shape the large
Tridacna shells of the Indian Ocean, with the inverse shown. Inside the building
the finest effect is the great altitude and chaste decoration of the ceiling of the
crush-room. A broad staircase of white marble leads from the portico, and the first
few steps are under a low archway, by contrast with which the splendid crush-room
comes as something of a revelation when the point at which the staircase turns at
right angles is reached. At the foot of the stairway, and in providing a smaller
ante-room where people may wait for their carriages instead of blocking the main
entrance, Mr. Pitt has seized the opportunity for some rich detail. An archway
supported by small Doric pillars leads into the little hall, which is paved in squares
of black and white marble, whilst the walls and ceiling are decorated with tastefully
wrought dadoes and cornices. It is a pleasant illustration both of managerial
forethought and architectural skill. Very much the same design is observed on a
larger scale in the foyer or grand crush-room, but even novices in architecture will
find their attention chained by the handsome ceiling.
“ On reaching the foyer, well-appointed cloak-rooms for ladies and gentlemen
appear immediately in front; on the right are casement doors leading to the
balconies, and on the left is the large three-arched entrance to the dress circle,
which is hung with portieres , instead of the ordinary swing doors. South from


the crush-room a wide passage leads to the cafe for occupants of the dress circle,
with a snuggery at one end. The fittings all show perfect finish, the woodwork
being walnut and Huon pine. In addition to the main entrance to the dress circle,
there are two wide archways and staircases, immediately in rear of the seats and
interior recesses, which will be fitted up as ferneries.
“ In the designing and decoration of the interior of the theatre the taste of Mr.
George Gordon, the well-known scenic artist, has found expression. The prevailing
colours—in fact, almost the only tints—arc peacock blue, a warm cream, and dead
gold. The proscenium takes the form of a richly gilt framing to whatever stage
picture may be presented, or between the acts to the new drop scene specially painted
for the theatre by Mr. Gordon. The three tones are carried throughout the stage
front and the auditorum, becoming richer towards the base of the building. The
arch over the proscenium is filled in with figures representing the Muses, and the
grouping of three mythological goddesses on a mosaic background is an effect
artistic both in conception and execution. The dome, rich in coloring, is so
arranged that by an easy mechanical contrivance it can be shot back, showing for a
space of 24 ft. the sky above —an appropriate outlook for Urania amongst the grouped
Muses, and a cool prospect for a crowded audience on an Australian summer’s night.
The triangular spandrils between the arch and the dome are filled in with Cupids,
and flanking the arch of the proscenium—two on either side —are lunettes, with
allegorical figures representing the arts. Between the acts these figures disappear,
and through the circular cavity the audience have a glimpse of a fern grotto, with a
cascade trickling down over artificial rock work. These little grottoes, as well as
gratifying the eye, provide the means by which a current of cool air is passed into
the auditorium. The box and balcony front of both the dress circle and family
circle, which are supported by airy gilded columns, are, as seen from the stage, very
handsomely decorated. From a plain ground gold decorations of raised scroll in
the style of the renaissance are lit up with tints varying from a warm cream to pale
coral pink, picked out here and there with gold. The seats in the dress circle are
upholstered in blue plush, while the frame work is of ebonised wood, instead of cast
iron. The curtains around the dress circle are of blue, richly embroidered with
gold; this one tint in the decorations of the theatre, although by no means the
prevalent colour, having cost something over TI,OOO. In the auditorium only the
electric light is used, and the decorations have been planned with a special view
to the effect produced by such light. No expense has been spared in the endeavour
to gain this end, and casual visitors to the new theatre will find something attractive
to occupy their attention between the acts.
“In the auditorium there are three divisions. The whole of the main floor,
which slopes sharply towards the stage, thus giving those to the rear an equally
clear view with the occupants of the front seats, is devoted to stalls. Above this is
the dress circle, with a loftier ceiling than usual, and higher still the family circle.
Both stalls and dress circle terminate in private stage boxes, supported by handsome
Corinthian pillars of masonry. The balcony of the boxes is pear-shaped in outline,
the inner curve being next the stage.

“ The stage and its equipment have a special interest for the profession, rather
than the public sitting before the curtain. The stage is not only of great depth,
and wide at the wings, but of exceptional height also, and the familiar chant
‘Up with the rag,’ should never be heard from ‘ the gods ’in this theatre. Flanking
the stage on one side are suites of lofty and well-ventilated dressingrooms, fitted
with lavatories and wardrobes, and in communication with the prompter’s box on
the stage by electric bells. The whole of the stage lighting is controlled by levers
close to the prompter’s stand. In the footlights and appliances for illuminating the
scenes some new English ideas are introduced, and amongst them one ingenious
contrivance for securing special light effects, such, for example, as the illustration
of a rich red sunset. With a spacious underground cellar for storage space, adding
detailed and every little device for facilitating stage work that experience could
suggest, faithfully carried out, the new Princess’s stands without a rival in Australia
as a place of public amusement.”
Some two years ago Mr. Williamson made another trip to his native
country and England, with the intention of securing attractions for the firm,
and that he succeeded in his intentions may be judged from the fact that it
resulted in the visit of Mr. Dion Boucicault and his dramatic company, and in the
obtaining of such special pieces as the operas of “Mikado,” “lolanthe,” &c., and
the dramas, “Human Nature,” “The Magistrate,” “The Private Secretary,” Ac.
Mr. Williamson is known, it may be said, throughout the world, but now more
especially in Australia, as being, not only a sterling actor and manager, but as a
gentleman and a man in all the true senses of the word.

Barnet Lazarus.


BARNET LAZARUS.
discovery of rich alluvial deposits of gold in 1851 was the primary
cause of the population of a district which has now come to be known as
the head-quarters of an auriferous country, consisting chiefly of quartz
ranges, which, from their inexhaustible character, have been a source of industry to
thousands. Sandhurst, the capital of this district, may fairly be considered to be the
premier goldfield of Victoria, especially since quartz-reefing enterprise received an
impetus in 1872, which not only caused the town (now city) to extend marvellously
in every direction, but which also attracted attention to deep sinking, the devotion to
which gave position to the quartz kings, Lansell, Watson and the subject of this paper.
Mr. Lazarus was born in Polish Prussia about 1816. As his circumstances in
his native land were not very comfortable, like many thousands of others he was
attracted to Victoria by the news of the discovery of rich goldfields. He arrived in
the colony in 1852, and at once went to Bendigo, where he commenced gold digging.
He worked in the neighbourhood of Kangaroo Gully for a short time with a little
success, and then removed to the White Hills, where he entered into partnership as a
storekeeper with Mr. B. Hekscher. The partnership came to a sudden termination,
however. He was then employed by Messrs. Hustler and Watson in one of the
claims on their famed Hustler’s Beef. Shortly afterwards, Mr. Lazarus was taken
into partnership by Mr. George Gibbs, who was the owner of a claim on the Black
Lead, New Chum. This claim formed a portion of the present Lazarus lease; it
was situated between the crushing plant of the Lazarus Company and Mr. Lansell’s
Fortuna Works —at that time known as Ballerstedt’s Claim. The Black Lead was
only a small reef, but it was a very rich one, and the partners obtained as much as
270z. of gold to the ton from it. They crushed the stone at Bruce’s machine,
Golden-square, and from the tailings afterwards obtained 4oz. to the ton. Shortly
after Mr. Lazarus joined Mr. Gibbs, the leasing regulations came into operation,
and they were then enabled to increase the size of their claim to upwards of 100
yards in length. On the reef known then as the White Lead (which was a very
large body, in places 70 feet wide), they obtained as much as 15oz. to the ton.
Mr. Bowman, the present mining manager of the Lazarus companies, worked with
Messrs. Gibbs and Lazarus on this reef about thirty and a-half years ago. The
profits realised by the partners were very large. Mr. Lazarus stated to Mr. Bowman
that in two years their profits were T22,000 per annum.
After taking considerably more than i! 80,000 worth of gold out of the claim,
and having worked it from 70 to 100 feet below the water level, work had to be
suspended, owing to the difficulty of overcoming the water, and the refusal of the


other claims to contribute towards drainage. Several fruitless attempts were made
to bring about a settlement, and then the whole line became swamped out and lay
idle for nearly two years. Mr. Gibbs about this time sold out his interest in the
claim to his partner, and Air. Lazarus became sole proprietor. After the interval
mentioned, work was resumed on the line, and here it is interesting to note that, in
turn, all sorts of mining appliances had been used on this claim. The old windlass,
whip, whim, and then the steam engine were the successive steps towards
improvement and perfection in the machinery used for hauling. The crushing in the
early days was effected by very rude and primitive means, which gradually gave way
to the present state of efficiency. Wooden stampers, iron rollers, Chilian mills, and
so on by progressive steps of improvement, till now, when all the latest and most
approved methods may be seen in operation. Between 22 and 23 years ago
Air. Bowman was appointed manager of Mr. Lazarus’ claim, and he continued to act
in that capacity for years after. During this period Mr. Lazarus received upwards of
4136,000 net profits out of his mine in dividends and by the sale of his interest.
The Lazarus ground has been one of the best and richest for its size on Bendigo.
Hitherto seven or eight payable reefs have been worked in it, while in few other
claims have more than three payable runs of stone been found. In 1879, he was
induced to sell half his interest in the claim for 420,000, and the Lazarus Company
in 45,000 shares was floated, and in 1871 the Lazarus No. 1 Company was formed to
work the southern portion of the lease. In 1879 Mr. Lazarus sold out nearly the
whole of his remaining interest in both companies for 440,000. Air. Lazarus was
one of the oldest reefers on the New Chum Hill, having been, in fact, one of its
pioneers, and having worked there for nearly twenty-seven years. He was a legitimate
miner, working his claim honestly and thoroughly, for the sake of what returns he
could get out of it. When it was formed into a public company he told Mr. Bowman,
his manager, to work it as he had hitherto done, and not to regard what might be
considered best with a view to market operations. He was a shrewd judge
of men, and not a great believer in them. He generally used sound judgment
and discretion in the management of his mine, and the improvements he
considered necessary in the machinery. He built a large house, known as
West End Hall, near his mine, some eighteen or nineteen years ago. He
was possessed of a large amount of property in Sandhurst, and was essentially
a local man ; retraining, as much as possible, from making investments
beyond his district. At one time he held considerable interest in other
claims on the New Chum line. A few years ago, prior to his death, he took
a trip to England, but did not remain long there. In 1880, he, one of the old
Bendigonians, departed this life, leaving a widow and four children behind him :
three sons and one daughter—the latter married. Air. Lazarus had been
suffering for over two years. Dr. Hinchcliff, his medical attendant, did all
that was possible to cure him, but without avail. His system suffered a complete
break up, and the immediate cause of death was chronic bronchitis.

(|ll ||ROM an educational point of view, no history of the Western District of
H c^or^a wou^ )e complete without some account of the establishment of
] fHp the Hamilton Academy. Before the year 1870, no institution for the
higher education of hoys existed in Hamilton, and parents were compelled to send
their sons away to Melbourne or elsewhere, or be content with such instruction as
the State Schools provided. It is true that several gentlemen of high scholastic
attainments had, at different times, endeavoured to establish a Grammar School at
Hamilton, but all these efforts, which were attended with varying success, eventually
underwent the same sad experience of failure. The educational wants of the district,
which were proclaimed far and wide through the local press, attracted the notice of
Mr. James Begg, who was at that time the Resident Assistant-Master at the
Hawthorn Grammar School, Melbourne. Accordingly, in December, 1869, he, in
company with his brother-in-law, the late Rev. P. S. Menzies, of the Scots’ Church,
made a tour of the Western District, and visited Hamilton with the intention of
embarking in a scholastic enterprise, if sufficient inducements were offered, and
had an interview with some of the leading residents of the district, among whom
were the late J. P. Hamilton, P.M., the Rev. J. K. Macmillan, 8.A., George Mott,
Esq., of the Hamilton Spectator, the late Henry Scott, Esq., and the late William
Skene, Esq. Mr. Begg, owing to the numerous cordial promises of support made to
him by the gentlemen of the town and district, accepted the invitation to open a
school in Hamilton. It was resolved, on the suggestion of Mr. Hamilton, P.M., that
the new school be called the “Academy,” after the well-known similar institution in
Edinburgh. Temporary classrooms were secured in the Baptist Chapel, and the
Academy was opened on the 17th of January, 1870.
Mr. James Begg, to whom is due the credit of having founded this
institution, was born at Falkirk, Stirlingshire, Scotland, on the 2nd of July,
1842. He is the eldest son of the Rev. Dr. Begg, of Falkirk, grandson of the
late Rev. Dr. Begg, of Newmonkland, Airdrie, and nephew of the late Dr. Begg,
of Edinburgh. He received his early education at the Falkirk Grammar School,
then under the Head-mastership of the late Rector W. S. Kemp, B.A. At sixteen
years of age he matriculated, and entered the University of Glasgow, where he
studied for the period of four years, under such famous men as the late Professor
Ramsay, the well-known author of “ Roman Antiquities; ” Sir William Thomson,
LL.D., then, as now, the highest authority on Electricity; and Professor Lushington,
LL.D., brother-in-law of the Poet Laureate, whom the latter refers to as “ wearing all
that weight of learning lightly, like a flower.” While at the University, Mr. Begg


was awarded the Cumbrae scholarship, tenable for two years, passed all the class and
ordinary examinations, completed his Arts course of Classics, Mathematics, Logic,
Moral Philosophy, and Natural Philosophy, and went up for the M.A. degree in the
departments of Classics and Mathematics. In the examinations he was successful,
and there only remained one department in which it was necessary to pass before he
could complete this degree.
At this juncture he was attacked with a severe illness which presented
unmistakable symptoms of consumption, and from the family physician (Sir James
Simpson, the discoverer of chloroform) he received imperative orders to abandon
studious habits and seek a warmer climate. He resolved to make Australia his home,
and within two months of this first attack of illness, sailed for Victoria. Before his
departure, a deputation from a large circle of friends in Falkirk waited on him and
presented him with a valuable writing desk and a purse of forty-two sovereigns, as a
mark of their esteem. On his arrival in Victoria, with a view to the complete
restoration of his health, he obtained an appointment as tutor to a squatter’s family,
and remained in the bush for five years, until this object had been accomplished, and
all indications of the dread disease that threatened him had disappeared.
Mr. Begg \vas twice married —first to Annie, eldest daughter of J. H. Macvean,
Esq., who died shortly after the birth of his son William ; and secondly to Margaret
Morrison, eldest daughter of the Rev. W. Hamilton, M.A., of Mortlake, and
grand-daughter of the Rev. James Clow, the first Presbyterian minister of Melbourne.
This lady has proved a worthy helpmate to him in his very arduous profession and
responsible position. Having thus sketched the early career of Mr. Begg, we will
endeavour to trace briefly the history of the Infant Institution entrusted to his care.
The enterprise, when fairly launched, proved highly successful, and it was not long
before a large number of boys was in attendance. At the end of the first year, in
order to accommodate boarders, the old Dundas Hotel was leased and put in proper
repair, and the Academy was transferred to that place in 1871.
It opened with nine boarders, in addition to the now rapidly increasing
number of day scholars. The Hamilton College, which had been in course of
construction for some time, having been completed, so far as the first plans went,
applications were invited for the position of head master, when, out of twenty-eight
candidates, two (Messrs. Wall and Begg) were proposed as eligible for the appointment.
Thirty-two proxy votes in favour of Mr. Begg having been rejected as informal, Mr. Wall
was elected by sixty-one votes to forty. A number of gentlemen, who had boys at
the Academy, dissatisfied with the result of the election, resolved to support Mr. Begg
against the College if he were willing to retain his position as head master, and an
address signed by twenty-one parents was presented to him. It stated that—“ We
are thoroughly satisfied with the progress made by our children under your care, and
having the fullest confidence in your ability to pass pupils through the University
matriculation, and generally to impart to them an education of the highest class, we
request that you will continue in the field you have so usefully occupied during the
past two years, with so much benefit to the pupils, and beg to assure you of our
JAMES BEGG,


determination to allow our boys to continue under your tuition.” This complimentary
and highly-deserved address, dated Hamilton, the Bth of September, 1871, was signed
by the Eev. J. K. Macmillan, 8.A., Messrs. W. Armstrong (Hexham), A. J. 13. Hestreo,
Geo. Mott, John McLellan (Cape Wrath), John Philip (Miga Lake), and fifteen
others.
Mr. Bcgg, who had made every preparation for at once leaving Hamilton, was
thus induced to remain. The erection of suitable buildings was deemed necessary,
and, accordingly, plans for a new academy were prepared by Mr. W. Smith, C.E.,
and the foundation stone was laid by Mrs. Begg on the 7th December, 1874.
It is built on rising ground at the western entrance to the town of Hamilton,
and consists of dormitories, dining-room, lavatories, bath-rooms, and every
convenience requisite for a comfortable boarding-school. It was finished in June,
1875. In 1879, the Hamilton College becoming vacant through the resignation of
Mr. Wall, Mr. Begg received a lease of the property for three years, from the Ist of
July. During his tenancy, owing to the union of the two schools, the college
attained a considerable prosperity, which, notwithstanding a severe outbreak of
diphtheria in Hamilton, remained unchecked, the numbers in daily attendance
averaging as high as from seventy to eighty pupils. While at the college, Mr. Begg,
with his private means, effected many great and permanent improvements. The
grounds, which previously had presented a wilderness-like appearance, were laid out
and planted with trees. Vegetable and flower gardens were trenched and stocked,
and some necessary fencing erected. At the end of his tenancy the directors of the
college offered to renew his lease on the same terms. This Mr. Begg declined, as he
considered that the rent was too high, but at the same time he expressed his
willingness to remain, should it be reduced. The directors refusing to giant his
request, Mr. Begg then left the College with his masters and pupils, and re-opened
the Academy in July, 1882. In October of the same year new class-rooms to
accommodate seventy pupils were built, and since that time the pioneei institution
has had its full share of prosperity. Young men educated at the Academy are to be
found scattered over Australia and New Zealand. While some have embraced
professional pursuits, and, as clergymen, doctors, solicitors, bankers, and suneyois,
are making their mark in the world, other old academicians have adopted a countiy
life. Some have settled near the old town, and some have pushed their way to the
far north, and are now assisting in the development of Queensland, Western
Australia, and the Northern Territory.

A KING into account tlie limited population of Ireland, an intelligent
observer is led to inquire into the proportionately enormous preponderance
°f Irish Colonists, as compared with those from other countries, and
perhaps the only solution of the question is that Irishmen are adventurous as well as
desirous of visiting climes other than their own. Addicted as they are to love of gaiety,
and enjoying fun and frolic thoroughly, they can, when circumstances demand it,
enter into the serious business of life with a determination to equal, if not excel,
their fellow-men. Irishmen have made themselves famous in the annals of history,
as generals, statesmen, judges, scholars, preachers, physicians, architects, contractors,
and men of commerce. They have attempted what those belonging to other
nationalities would have hesitated to dare and deemed impossible of accomplishment,
a fact mainly owing to them not at all times counting the cost of a reverse. The
analysis of an Irishman’s character is interesting, although the assertion is frequently
made that it is such a combination of contradictions as to render the undertaldng a
hopeless task.
It is not our purpose to engage the reader’s attention in this manner, however
strong the temptation may be, when writing of the sons of the “Emerald Isle,” by
contributing to the columns of speculative philosophy with a psychological disquisition.
Suffice it to say that he is generous to a fault, and that he posseses courage and bravery,
which, together with shrewdness, giving place at times to a perfect abandon, go to
make up a delightful if singular combination. Again, his eccentricity has afforded
amusement to his own countrymen, as well as to other nationalities, who attribute to
him many sayings possessing neither wit nor humour. “Give me a good hater,” said
Dr. Johnson. An Irishman is the fulfilment of the celebrated lexicographer’s request,
his hatred being as intense as his love. Again, an Irishman is an important factor
in the social and political life of the people, his characteristics being so prominent
as to influence those with whom he comes in contact. As already stated, numbers
of Irishmen have flocked to these shores, the principal history of the colony being
contemporary with their lives, and will naturally link itself to them, while their careers
enumerated in a volume of this nature will serve to keep their names fresh in the
minds of future generations. The successes they achieved after undergoing hardships
and struggles known only to themselves, indicate sufficiently the powers of endurance
and strength of character with which they are endowed. To them, the Australians
of succeeding generations must ever remain indebted, for the fruits of their labors
will not cease to continue while the continent remains.

It is not to be understood that the palm of superiority is demanded for them,
but merely that they are entitled to that credit which is due to their energetic efforts
in building up, in conjunction with the people of other countries, these colonies, and
causing them to stand out in the present age as the probable home of many who are
now turning their face thitherwards. The congested state of European population
can only be remedied by some prudent and well-regulated measure of emigration,
which shall be instrumental in sending forth to new countries the best mechanics
and artisans, together with the highest order of talent in the professions, bearing in
mind that legislation is as unable to regulate supply and demand as it is incapable
of making people moral, since eradication is not suppression. What men have
accomplished in the past, it is possible to effect in the present; besides, there is the
additional advantage to those starting in life, of possessing a history of the success
or failure of their predecessors, and of the means whereby it was brought about.
The history contained in this brief sketch is the history of a successful man, who
owes everything to his own efforts, and who has led a modest and, comparatively
speaking, retired life. Mr. John Meagher was born in Ireland, and is a native of
Ballina, an historic town on the banks of the well-known river Shannon. His early
years were spent in recreation and attending the school of his native place. While
young and in the prime of life, some of his near relatives formed a determination to
go to Australia, a country which was at that time the subject of much speculation as
to the probabilities of its being a suitable place in which those leaving their native
land might settle. The scanty information then available of the resources of the
country, and the proximity of America, gave rise to numerous conjectures as to the
wisdom of such an undertaking. The feeling that emigrants were going to a land
over which the old flag floated, acted, in many cases, as a strong inducement to brave
the trials and dangers of a voyage, lasting for a period of nearly four months. Mr.
Meagher decided to accompany his friends, and took his passage in the ship
“ England,” which left Liverpool on April 4,1841. The vessel arrived safely in
Hobson’s Bay on July 16 of the same year, after a voyage of 102 days from port to port.
Melbourne, at this period, did not present an appearance in the least degree resembling
what is witnessed to-day. No well laid-out streets, no large emporiums of commerce,
no capacious docks, and none of the comfortable and expeditious means of locomotion
now enjoyed by a new arrival. Some portion of time, after Mr. Meagher’s advent to
Melbourne, was occupied in the consideration of what would prove the most suitable
sphere of employment; and eventually, ho engaged in the brewing trade, which was
then in its infancy in that city. After having remained there for two years and a
half, he went, in company with his family, to Port Fairy, better known now as Belfast.
Here he commenced business on his own account, thus establishing the first
industry of the kind in Belfast. He carried on this business with great success until
the latter part of 1854, when he bought land in the neighbourhood, and undertook
pastoral pursuits on a small scale. Gradually, as opportunities offered, he added to
his freehold property, but, occasionally, he only bought on speculation, and when
favourable times presented themselves, disposed of his purchase. By this means he

aai
amassed a considerable amount of money. Mr. Meagher made it a rule in business,
to which lie always adhered, of not attempting any project on borrowed capital. He
bought, in 1862, the handsome estate now known as “Stonefield,” near Mount House
and Penshurst, which contains about 5,888 acres, and, in 1879, went to reside on it,
having determined on making it his home. After a residence ol six years at
“ Stonefield,” he let it, and returned with his family to Belfast, where he has remained
up to the present time. His individual capacity and experience render him peculiarly
fitted to rank amongst the Representative Men of Australia, who can attribute their
success, not to a turn of the wheel of fortune, but to perseverance and industry, and
by which, as we have seen in these memoirs, more than one has contrived to become
the object of respect, and a source of general benefit to the community. The
successful man of enterprise affords employment to bread-winners, and staves off
misery and wretchedness and squalor, by laying out his capital on productive works,
which, while they add to his wealth, increase proportionately the welfare ot his
fellow-beings.
Mr. Meagher has for many years taken an interest in, and been successfully
identified with, municipal matters, always endeavouring, by his counsel, to advance
the prosperity of the town with which he is so intimately connected. He has also
received a Commission of the Peace, and is remarkable for tempering justice
with mercy.

||| jpN iese flays of liigli pressure, it is refreshing to meet with the records of
t men who have served their God and their country faithfully, and withal,
in an unostentatious manner. There is a disposition in a new country to
what may he termed “display,” hut this is rather the outcome of physical vigour. The
salubrious and agreeable climate with which Victoria is blessed, incites to outdoor
amusements, and tends to check the contemplative mood. Accordingly, when we
hear or read of those given to a study of the profound subjects which arc everywhere
to be found in nature, we are irresistibly attracted towards such persons. To those,
who, in addition to attending to their professional or commercial pursuits, spend their
spare moments on something else than “airy nothings,” we arc indebted, inasmuch as
they show us a better way, and teach us that “ man was not made to live by bread
alone.” The gentleman whose name is at the head of this sketch was, when living,
worthy to be ranked amongst the foremost benefactors of the country of Australia.
Sprung from a noble stock, he preserved unsullied the fame and name of his family.
In the Western District that name is a household word. For uprightness, for
manliness, for the highest integrity, Suetonius Henry Officer will be remembered for
many years to come. He was the third son of Sir Robert and Lady Officer, of
Hallgreen, Tasmania. He was born at Hallgreen, New Norfolk, in the year 1880.
At an early age, accompanied by his brother, C. M. Officer, he went to Edinburgh to
be educated, and there attended the Edinburgh Academy, a school of very high
repute. He next, for a short time, studied at the Military Academy in that city,
preparatory to entering the Navy, but circumstances arising which prevented this
course being carried out, he returned to Australia and engaged in mercantile life in
Tasmania for some years. Subsequently he came across to Victoria while the gold
fever was at its height. Like a good many others he tried his luck at the diggings,
but was not a “lucky digger.” Mr. Officer then entered into pastoral pursuits in
conjunction with his brothers at the well-known station Mount Talbot, near
Balmoral, in the Wimmera District.
There he remained for many years, and thence he went to Riverina, where he
purchased the station of Melool, which he shortly afterwards sold to Mr. Davis. Ho
and his brother, Mr. C. M. Officer, then became the purchasers of the adjoining-
stations of Willakool and Murray Downs, of which he was the manager and resident
partner. Both of these had large frontages to the Murray. Knowing the value of
such land, Mr. Officer secured by purchase the whole of the river frontage before
land selection was ever talked of. It would occupy too much space in a short memoir
to touch upon all this gentleman’s schemes for irrigation. Suffice it to say that years


before there were any schemes for the irrigation of the dry lands adjacent to the Murray,
and which have just lately been introduced on a large scale by the Messrs. Chafifey Bros,
further down the river, he had on Murray Downs erected pumps worked by horse
power and windmills. By these appliances, large paddocks laid down in lucerne,
maize, etc., besides an extensive orchard and orangery, were irrigated. The prolific
crops, resulting from this method of agriculture, were the wonder and admiration of all
who saw or heard of them. Becoming an enthusiastic irrigationist, and feeling
convinced of the advantages of the system, he soon replaced the horse and wind-mill
power by steam and more powerful pumps, which enabled him to increase the area to
he irrigated. Mr. Officer had large schemes in preparation for irrigating on a vast
scale, when he was seized with the illness from which he died, and since then this
splendid property has passed into other hands. Under his personal superintendence
and untiring energy, the experiment of acclimatising the ostrich, and making ostrich
farming a remunerative industry in this country for the first time, has been
accomplished. Nothing was spared to ensure the success of the enterprise, Mr.
Officer in this undertaking, as in everything else, spending time, labour, zeal, energy,
and bringing a superior intelligence to cope with and overcome the difficulties he had
to encounter. From his early youth he evinced an ardent thirst for knowledge, and
devoted all his spare moments to reading good and instructive books, a habit to which
—as he frequently asserted—he owed much of his success in life. The bent of his
mind was scientific, and, consequently, lie took an interest in all the discoveries and
progress of modern science. He was a devout and earnest student of the wonders of
astronomy, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to show to some sympathetic
friend the glories of the great expanse of Heaven through his fine telescope. He was
a leader in all religious and philanthropic works in his district, and, wherever he went,
he was known as a just man, and one who feared God.
In the year 1881 he took up his residence in Melbourne, whither he came for
the education of his children. He purchased the property of Leighwood, Toorak,
and resided there until his death, which occurred after a series of illnesses, from
which he suffered, on July 20, 1883. Beloved and respected by all who knew him,
a warm-hearted and sincere friend, a benefactor of the poor, an upright and
honourable man of business, “ whose word was his bond,” and a devout and humble
Christian. In the year 1860 he married Mary Lillias Bigg, the fourth daughter
of the Rev. Dr. Cairns, and by her had four sons and two daughters, who all
survive him.

assemble parliaments and councils to have the benefit of their collective
wisdom, but we necessarily have, at the same time, the inconvenience
* of their collateral passions, prejudices, and private interests. By the
help of these, artful men overpower their wisdom and dupe its possessors. Liberalism
in Australia is similar to Conservatism in England in this respect, that it usually
splits on the rock of finance. The chief aim is, in both cases, to make things
pleasant, and a programme shaped on such a principle cannot be continued for any
lengthened period. Experience teaches that no section of the community is less
united in political opinion than that which comprises the laboring classes. A little
finesse on the part of a candidate will generally serve to split this vote, but it is quite
another matter in regard to the vote of the small property owners, whose name is
legion in every Australian electorate. To secure this vote entails the giving of explicit
pledges for the expenditure of public moneys for local purposes. The successful
candidate must be “sound” upon the local railway question, and must cherish a strong
opinion in favour of the construction of certain roads, bridges, &c. Moreover, he
must have a thorough appreciation of the “wants” of the district, in the shape of
extra public local institutions and functionaries, and hence it is that administrations
which undertake to enjoy a pleasant time of it with the Assembly, come to
systematically ignore the fundamental principles of sound finance. Any member, then,
of any such Assembly who has a special gift in the direction of sifting figures, and who
conscientiously adheres to principle in vetoing the expenditure of public money for
the benefit of a small section of the community, may expect to be looked upon as a
“bore,” and to reap his reward, as times go, in securing the ill-will and antagonism
of those he endeavours to lead in these matters. It is through these short-sighted
politicians as such financiers endeavour to set right, that not only the people,
but the material resources of a colony, are invariably misunderstood and widely
misrepresented. Victoria, during the past ten years, has had no more discreet
legislator, especially where the finances ot the colony are concerned, than the
gentleman whose name heads this biographical sketch. Active, energetic, irrepressible,
with a marvellous aptitude for figures, a keen perspicacity, a power ol lucid expression,
and a far-reaching grasp of circumstances and conditions, he has done as much, il
not more, for the general weal of the colony than any other member ol the Victorian
Legislative Assembly.


Mr. James Mirams, the third surviving son of the late Reverend James
Mirams, a well-known Melbourne minister of the Congregational Church,
was born in the Kennington district of the parish ol St. Mary s, Lambeth, on the
2nd January, 1889.
In 1848, the family removed from London to Chishill, a village in Essex,
about four miles from Royston. Here, for about five years, the subject of our
sketch pursued the ordinary routine of an English education, under the care of a
neighbouring minister of the Congregational denomination. At the age of fourteen
Mr. Mirams returned to the metropolis and became assistant to an uncle who was in
business as an ironmonger, at Kingsland. Continuing in that situation about three
years, he subsequently occupied one of a similar character at Royston, in the vicinity
of the family residence. Here he remained till, with the rest of his family, he left
England for this colony. Arriving at Melbourne in June, 1857, Mr. Mirams, in
accordance with a previous determination, devoted himself to agricultural pursuits,
first in connection with a relative, then settled as a dairy farmer in the neighbourhood
of Braybrook, and, subsequently, on his own account. After about five years so
occupied, the losses consequent on two successive seasons of drought and the
prevalence of fatal cattle disease necessitated the relinquishing of the business. In
the meantime, Mr. Mirams had married, and now, with a wife and two young
children, he found himself in the position, not very unusual at that time in the
colonies, of having to make a fresh start in life. He removed to Melbourne and
obtained an appointment as an assistant teacher in the then National School, in
George Street, Fitzroy. While thus engaged, he again entered upon commercial
life as a bookseller, stationer, and news agent, in Smith Street, Collingwood. On the
establishment, by Mr. Mirams, of the Premier Permanent Building, Land and
Investment Association, of which he has since been and is now the secretary,
he disposed of his business, which in the meantime had developed and extended into
three separate establishments, and devoted himself entirely to that institution, which,
under his able management, has now secured a foremost position amongst kindred
establishments in the colony. During his residence at Kingsland, Air. Mirams
united himself with the Congregational Church there, and has ever since been identified
with the interests of that denomination. For many years a member of the Oxford
Street Church, Collingwood, he rendered good service in the offices of deacon and
treasurer. His possession of the confidence and esteem of the denomination in
general is evinced in his having for some time held the office of minute secretary to
the Congregational Union and Mission in this colony, and in being at present a trustee
of the Congregational Ministers’ Provident Association, and, also, a trustee of the
Congregational Church Building Association. A total abstainer from his birth, Air.
Mirams has laboured ardently and extensively in the advocacy and defence of the
principles of true temperance. In November, 1808, he joined the “Undaunted”
Tent of the Order of Rechabites, Collingwood, of which he continues a member and
trustee. In the educational controversies of the time, he took an active and

decided part as a frequent writer on the subject, and member of the Collingwood
Board ot Advice, to which he was correspondent, till the pressure of other claims
obliged him to resign his office. In 1876, he entered political life as Member for
Collingwood, and as a politician it is scarcely necessary to say that Mr. Mirams was
a Protectionist and Land Keformer, for it is by his lectures, speeches, and writings
upon these topics that he has won for himself the position of a leader. Among the
originators of the Protection League and the National Eeform League, he took a
leading part in the political struggles of 1875 to 1880. As honorary secretary of
both these organisations, a prominent speaker at their meetings, and a candidate for
a seat in the Legislative Assembly, which he so triumphantly obtained, securing the
largest majority ever known in the constituency, he won golden opinions for himself
through his rectitude and consistency. Mr. Mirams has always expressed himself
tersely on the matter of insuring the hona fide settlement and cultivation of the land
as one of the two conditions pre-eminently necessary to the maintaining of a
permanent and necessary prosperity, the other condition being the affording of plenty
and profitable employment to the workers of the community. With reference to the
land question, his idea was that there are two ways in which land could be utilised
for the benefit of the people, first, by securing from it a direct revenue for State
purposes ; and, second, by the settlement upon it of men with their wives and families,
who would for all time contribute to the expense of government, and aid in the
prosperity of the colony. The first process had been found a failure, and it was
determined to substitute the direct for the indirect benefit, by settling a yeoman class
on the soil. The only way by which these two objects could be permanently secured
was, in Mr. Mirams’ opinion, for the State to retain its proprietorship of the land
and lease it upon favourable terms to its occupiers. The act of 1869, because it
did not comply with these conditions, has always had a determined opponent in
Mr. Mirams, who, when the rent was reduced still further, with his knowledge of figures
and finance, proved that the purchase money simply represented the payment for
twenty years of five per cent, interest on the assumed value of the land, and contended
that no property holder would so dispose of his goods and chattels. The system
introduced by the act in question had simply tended to a monopoly of land, inasmuch
as capitalists purchased it wholesale from the selectors. Mr. Mirams’ advocacy of
the land of the colony paying for its government under the leasing system invariably
met with opposition from a certain section of the House, and four out of every five
members who were assured of the wisdom of his scheme, evaded supporting him by
asserting that the time had gone by for giving effect to the system.
His speech delivered on the second reading of the Land Acts Continuation
and Amendment Bill, in October, 1882, distinguished by its clearness and lucidity,
comprised an impartial review of the history of land legislation in \ ictoria, and
pointed out, most unmistakably, the errors and defects of the existing system. The
remedy which he commended for immediate adoption was one that had many sincere
advocates in this and other Australian colonies, in all of which the land question has
JAMES MILAMS.


for many years proved a fruitful source of controversy. In that speech Mr. Mirams
urged that the adoption of a system of State leasing would at least prevent the
perpetration of fresh blunders, and avoid the perpetuation of those which have been
hitherto committed. Of the speech itself The Age said: —
It would be difficult to speak too highly of the valuable contribution made to the leasing
question by the Hon. Member for Collingwood, Mr. Mirams, in a speech which exhibited some
of the best qualities which distinguish him —industry, fair dealing, lucidity of statement, considerable
powers of generalisation, and a keen sense of the weakness of his opponents’ arguments.
It would be almost supererogatory to state that every Budget speech brought
Mr. Mirams to his feet, and that the House always had the benefit of his acute
perception on this particular head.
In 1879, Mr. Mirams made public his ideas on the establishment of a
National Bank of Issue, which, he argued, would limit the power and influence
without interfering with the profits of existing institutions, while, at the same time,
it would steady and extend the monetary arrangements of the community, and give
the people the profit of the currency instead of bank shareholders. Of course, it need
not be added that the scheme met with severe opposition from interested sections of
the community. A rejoinder by Mr. Mirams to some of his critics published in
pamphlet form had a large circulation, and was so conclusive a reply as to silence
his opponents.
In May, 1882, the subject of our sketch was appointed Chairman of the Royal
Commission appointed to inquire into and report upon the incidence and working of
the Customs Tariff of Victoria, and in that capacity, it is acknowledged by all that
he did the colony good service. This Commission, every member of which
rendered his services gratuitously, sat for about three years, examined a large number
of witnesses in all parts of the colony, and connected with every branch of industry
and trade, and its report must form the basis of any revision of the tariff which the
Legislature may undertake. As its chairman, Mr. Mirams brought to bear his large
and varied fund of information, and displayed such tact and impartiality in the
discharge of his onerous duties, as not only to conciliate his most pronounced
political opponents, but to enhance the confidence of his friends, thereby establishing
his claims as an able leader and reliable guide upon social, fiscal, and political
questions.
All who have made themselves at all acquainted with the history of the colony
and Sir Graham Berry’s Reform Bill will not have forgotten the prominent part
taken by Mr. Mirams in the debate on that Bill. Apart from the energy and talent
brought to bear by our subject on matters fiscal and political, he has ever been
mindful of the reputation of Victoria, and has on more than one occasion splintered
a lance in her defence. No more exhaustive and comprehensive article than that
penned by Mr. Mirams and published in London, in reply to an article by
G. Baden Powell in the Fortnightly Review, has ever appeared, dealing with the
reprehensibility of writers, who, paying transient visits to our shores, satisfy
themselves with making observations and forming opinions on the most superficial

data, return home and write lengthy tirades to newspapers and journals, to give
publicity to the fact of their travels and the information which they think they have
gained. These articles are usually written in support of the individual views of the
author, and ignore altogether the colonial aspects of the case, and the altered
circumstances and conditions under which old theories have to be applied and old
axioms reduced to practice. The article referred to was a complete reply to Mr.
Powell on “ Protection in young communities,” and clearly proved that New South
Wales had not made more progress under, and in consequence of, its free trade policy,
than Victoria under a policy of protection; and that, taking the Australian Colonies as
an illustration, John Stuart Mill’s admission that “ protection might he found under
certain conditions economically defensible in a young community,” was neither
wrong in theory nor unwarranted by experience.
Mr. Mirams’ latest business enterprise is his connection with the “ Federal
Coffee Palace C 0.,” of which he is secretary. Of this venture it may be said that
success is assured. The site chosen for the building is the very best for the
purpose that could have been selected. It is close to the railway terminus and
the wharves, and is easily accessible from all parts of the city. There will be 450 to
500 bedrooms, and the building also provides for the erection of shops or offices along
the whole street frontage, which will produce a large income. The largest and
handsomest dining room on this side of the world will be provided, on the ground
floor, for the use of the general public; and on the first and second floors other
diningrooms for the use of the lodgers will be set apart. Billiard rooms, reading and
smoking rooms, drawing rooms, and private parlours have been arranged for the
comfort and accommodation of boarders ; and every modern appliance and possible
convenience will be utilised in the construction of the building, to ensure its beino-
-07 O
the favourite resort of all travellers and visitors to the coloiry.
From the above sketch it will be seen that Mr. Mirams has been more or less
a worker in various fields of political, social, educational, and religious enterprise.
For many years he has been before the public prominently as newspaper
correspondent, platform speaker, lecturer, and pamphleteer. Uniting clearness of
perception with terseness of expression, possessed of untiring energy and perseverance,
which defeat or failure cannot exhaust, it is not surprising that he has achieved
success. If Mr. Mirams has a speciality amongst the many and various subjects to
which he has devoted his attention, we should say it is finance and statistics; and
these which, as a rule, are looked upon as dry and uninteresting matters, become,
under his clear and concise treatment, attractive and instructive.
Mr. Mirams is essentially what is called a self-made man, and in his person
unites very many of those characteristics of the Anglo-Saxon race, which make it
the most successful, as a colonising community, the world has ever produced. It is
such men as Mr. Mirams who are the life and soul of a young colony like this, and
in its growth and progress we sec the result of these capacities for contriving,
thinking, and working put to the best use under the most favourable circumstances.

Much of his success Mr. Mirams attributes to the sympathy, suppoit, and
assistance of his wife,who is the granddaughter ot Mr. Paterson, a gentleman who held
a lieutenant’s commission under Captain Collins, when that officer in 1802 attempted
to found a settlement on the present site ol Sorrento. On the abandonment of that
attempt, Captain Collins and those under his command went over to Tasmania, where
Mrs. Mirams’ father was born. Mr. and Mrs. Mirams have had a family of fourteen
children, ten of whom survive. Some of these are married and have children of
their own; consequently, Mrs. Mirams holds the unique position of being the
centre of five colonial generations.
To the surprise of the whole community, Mr. Mirams was defeated at
Colling wood at the general election in 1886, after ably representing that
constituency for ten years. Should he desire to re-enter political life, it is not likely
he will long remain without a seat, as any constituency in the colony would be glad
to secure the services of a gentleman of such capacity and consistency.

REV. CANON WATSON.
there is no sphere which is so well calculated to test manly and
tmlj Coura o eous h ua liti es as that of the clergyman. In his profession he
is called upon to witness scenes hut faintly guessed at by others, and as he
is obliged to deal with the operations of the heart rather than those of the mind, he
consequently becomes more intimate with the passions of mortal nature. He sees
the littleness and the greatness of man, and he is called upon to exercise the greatest
wisdom in eradicating the former and giving a true direction to the latter. He must
present the Representative Man of the age in such a light as to attract those among
whom he moves towards the goal of their hopes. Indeed, he is under the necessity of
being himself in a humbler sense a Representative Man of the people, one who can
respond to the throes of sorrow or the thrills of joy. At the baptismal font, at the
hymeneal altar, at the deathbed scene, he has respective duties to perform, and to
few is it given to discharge each function in a natural and unaffected manner. The
colonies are fortunate in possessing men in all denominations who can answer these
requirements without becoming mere actors, men who are not artificial, hut natural,
and judging from the respect that is shown to Canon Watson, we must say that he is
one gifted with no mean powers to live the life of a man in the world but not of
the world.
George Wade Watson was born at Sorell, Tasmania, on Bth February, 1838.
His father, Brereton Rolla Watson, was an officer in the East India Company’s service,
and one of the earliest settlers in Tasmania, where he engaged as a farmer and
grazier. Canon Watson was educated at a public school first, and afterwards at Mr.
J. M. Nelson’s Grammar School solely by private tuition, and received his theological
training at the well-known Moore College, Liverpool, New South Wales, an institution
which has turned out some excellent divinity scholars. While young he was obliged
to engage in business pursuits owing to his father’s failure, and he afterwards
undertook teaching in the public schools in Tasmania. His first essay in the duties
connected with clerical life was his appointment as a reader in January, 1862, in
Ballarat, where he laboured under the Rev. R. T. Cummins, and the late Archdeacon
Potter, until May, 1863. He then proceeded to Moore College, where he remained
for one year, after which he was ordained deacon by the late Bishop of Sydney, Dr.
Barker, on letters dimissory from the Vicar-General of Melbourne, on May 22, 1864,
at St. Luke’s, Liverpool, New South Wales, and Priest by the Bishop of Melbourne,
Dr. Perry, St. James’s Cathedral, Melbourne, on December 24, 1865.


After receiving deacon’s orders lie was sent to supply at Woods Point from May
to September, 1864, where the faithful discharge of his duties gained for him, on
leaving for Mansfield, the agreeable recognition of the parishioners through the
medium of an address and a purse of sovereigns. He remained at Mansfield until
June, 1867, and was busily engaged in the organisation of church work in the district,
and also succeeded in building a brick church and a vicarage.
Canon Watson was then appointed to St. Peter’s, Eaglehawk, and in January,
1869, at Bishop Perry’s special request went to St. John’s, Ballarat, where there were
great troubles, owing to the ritualistic tendencies of the curate in charge. There is
nothing so calculated to test the tact of a clergyman as a case of this description, for
there is certain to be. two opposing parties, one in favour of, and the other hostile to
the ritualistic curate. But Canon Watson was equal to the occasion, and succeeded
in gathering the scattered congregation together, placed the Sunday School in a state
of efficiency, and increased its numbers fourfold. He made large additions to the
church, doubling its sitting capacity, purchased a house for the vicarage, and also
added largely to it. He was compelled, owing to long and continued ill-health,
brought on no doubt by his arduous labours, to resign this charge in April, 1874,
and received, prior to his departure, an address and present. He then went to act as
locum tenens for the Rev. Canon Sargeant, at Sale, Gippsland, and in 1875, on Canon
Sargeant’s resignation, was appointed to that incumbency, which he holds up to the
present time. There he set actively to work once more, organising the church work
in the country and founding new parishes and districts. In Sale itself, during this
time, the congregation has built a large, handsome, and commodious brick church in
the centre of the town, at a cost of over T4,000, and purchased a large brick house in
the town where he now resides, instead of at the glebe, which is some two miles
distant from Sale. He was elected Canon of Melbourne in 1876, under the Act of
Assembly limiting the term to five years, and appointed Rural Bean of Sale in 1877.
Recently, on January 14, 1887, the twenty-fifth anniversary of his wedding,
he was presented with a purse of sovereigns, his wife at the same time receiving
many valuable and useful presents. We are of the opinion that few men can, within
the space of twenty-three years, produce a better record of faithful and honest work
than the preceding account exhibits, and we are sure that we faintly re-echo the
sentiments of his numerous circle of friends, by wishing the Canon and his partner
many bright and happy days.

MR. W. H. DILLON.
material prosperity of a country depends in great measure on her
SSK works of industry, and to the man who has contributed his share in
rearing, from an embryonic state, that which shall prove remunerative
to the community, a grateful remembrance is due. He who encounters much
opposition in climbing upwards from the bottom rung of the ladder is surely entitled,
in gaining the acme of his particular sphere, to be regarded as one of the brave
spirits of society, and to have his name handed down to posterity as an example of
what British pluck or colonial “go ” can effect. Some men set out in life with
immense advantages over their fellows ; they may be the fortunate possessors of a
large patrimony, or they may enter on a business already firmly established, or they
may enjoy great social advantages. To use the expressive language of the race-
course, those who lack such benefits are heavily handicapped in the race of life,
and yet it is to the latter class—to those who are the architects of their own fortune
—that an unfeigned recognition of true worth should be accorded. To this class
belonged the late William Henry Dillon, son of Captain William Lambert Mortimer
Dillon, the master of a merchantman.
Mr, Dillon was born in the county of Cornwall, in the year 1822. After
leaving school he was apprenticed to Messrs. Yolckman and Co., confectioners,
London, where he served his full term of apprenticeship. Symptoms of restlessness,
however, began at the time to develop themselves in his character, which caused him
to long for travel, and to visit different parts of the world. Proceeding to Jersey,
one of the Channel Islands, he spent some time there, and arrived in Melbourne in
1852, after having gone to New York and travelled through the United States. At
that time Melbourne was only in its primitive stage of development. There is no
doubt that to those possessed of capital many openings presented themselves by
which judicious investors might in time realize wonderful profits, or perhaps colossal
fortunes ; whereas, on the other hand, the man who had every inch of his way to make
by his own exertions was obliged to forego for a time the expectation of realizing
a rapid fortune by such an event as a rise in shares or in the value of marketable
commodities. Two courses lay open to the immigrant of those days; it was
optional with him to save his earnings, gained by hard work in his profession or
trade, with a view to ultimately start in business on his own account, or to try his
luck on the goldfields, which had recently been discovered in Victoria. Mr. Dillon
decided to adopt the former course, and after having worked very hard for a couple
of years he found himself in a position to send home for his wife and family, whom
he had thought best to leave behind him, as the country was in an unsettled state,


and the vicissitudes of colonial life were numerous. Moreover, he naturally desired
to have some provision made for them in the shape of a settled home.
At this period we find Mr, Dillon possessing sufficient capital to undertake
business, which he accordingly did, choosing Brunswick as the place and Mr.
Barfoot as his first partner, shortly afterwards taking Mr, Burrows into the firm.
Mr. Barfoot subsequently withdrew from the firm, which from that time traded
under the name of Dillon and Burrows. This firm is now widely known throughout
Australasia for the extent of its business and the variety and quality of its comfits,
confectioneries, and sweetmeats. For a number of years from its initiation the
firm experienced a severe struggle in establishing itself, owing entirely to the existence
of an import duty of £6 per ton on sugar, and the admission of confectionery duty
free. However, great exertions, perseverance, and attention to the details of the
business brought their own reward, for the firm began to receive some return for its
outlay and labour, and Mr. Dillon extended his operations so far as to take the
Scotch Pie Shop, afterwards Duncan’s, in Bourke-street. So successful was this
undertaking that in a short time thousands of pounds were netted. The business
hitherto had been wholesale and retail, but it was decided that, for the future, sole
attention should be given to the wholesale trade. In order to carry out this object
Mr. Dillon secured a block of land in Latrobe-street west, and erected the large
factory which is now the central office of several branches, and which he bequeathed,
together with his share of the business, to his only son, Mr. William Henry Dillon,
a present partner in the firm.
A great extension of the business took place when the new factory in
Latrobe-street was opened, and when the firm a short time afterwards purchased
a rival establishment owned by Whittingham Bros., Little Lonsdale-street, the
success of the business was much more pronounced. Desirous of promoting to the
utmost the interests of the business by the introduction of the most modern improve-
ments in machinery, Mr, Dillon proceeded to Great Britain and the Continent of
Europe to inspect the different plants. In addition to purchasing a plant capable
of turning out goods of a quality unsurpassable in any part of the old country, he
arranged for the shipment of the first lozenge machine imported to Australia.
Mr. Dillon’s commercial activity caused him to make another trip to the old
country, as he possessed the shrewdness to see that the interests of the business
could best be secured by a complete knowledge of all improvements that might
be effected in the productions of the trade. The efforts he made to develop and
improve his business were recognized by the Confectioners’ Society, as he had
rendered great service to them by the introduction of modern styles of machinery,
which, consequently, resulted in a vast improvement in the goods that were
manufactured. At a banquet to which he was invited his career was spoken of
in very appreciative terms, and his services were acknowledged to be worthy of the
highest approbation.
At the time Mr. Dillon performed those trips to England and the Continent
of Europe, travelling by sea was not the pleasant undertaking it is in these days of
powerful and well-appointed steamers. The number of these from which a selection

can be made for a home of six weeks’ duration on the rolling main, the elegance dis-
played in the fitting up, and, most important of all, the cuisine , which is excellent,
render a journey home a comparatively enjoyable event. And again, as to the
variety, it is possible to have your formaggio with your soup on board an Italian,
sauer kraut on a German, perchance pat e-de-foie- gras on a French, but most decidedly
John Bull’s roast beef on board an English steamer. Some thirty years ago he
went to a new rush near Rockhampton, with a view to establish a depot, but not
finding a favourable opening, returned to Melbourne, when he put forth all his energy
to lay the foundation of the present extensive business, which gives employment to
about 300 hands in the four factories in Melbourne. The factory in Kent-street,
Sydney, finds work for some 60 to 70 hands, and there are depots for the sale
of the firm’s goods in Geelong, Ballarat, Sandhurst, and other places throughout
the colonv. Mr. Dillon left on his first voyage to England towards the end of
1867, and was absent from the colony for a period of eight months, a considerable
portion of this time being spent in visiting the English and Continental establishments.
Some eleven years ago he nearly met with a tragic end when returning from a
holidav trip to Queensland by the City of Melbourne, which was within an ace of
being lost in that most dangerous vicinity, Sydney Heads, having encountered the
terrible gale during which the ill-fated Dandenong foundered. The privations and
hardships which he and his fellow-passengers underwent were so seveie as to
contribute largely to the bodily ailments from which he was theieaftei ne\ei
entirely free.
After Mr. Dillon’s return from his second trip to England, his failing energies
compelled withdrawal from some of the more arduous duties which had absoibcd
so much of his attention and time ; but it was too late, as his constitution was
undermined by overwork and much anxious care. He died on 19th September, 18/8,
almost in harness, deeply regretted both by the firm, which owes its success mainly
to his business capacity, and by a widow and five surviving children. He did not
interest himself actively in political or municipal affairs, but nevertheless took an
intelligent view of all matters connected with the interests of the colony. The trade
may thank him for his untiring and successful efforts in assisting them to obtain the
remission of the former oppressive tax of £6 per ton customs duty on sugai. He
was a member of the Church of England, and walked in an unostentatious
manner. He was well known to many old colonists, highly respected, deaily beloved
by his family, and deeply lamented by those who can feel what it is to lose m a
commercial community a man of industrious activity.

this country, where horse-racing is such a favourite pastime that every
«1| little township can boast of its racing club, it may not prove uninteresting
to those who will dip into this volume to give an account of the origin and
progress of this popular amusement. Notwithstanding the many attempts that have
been made by well-meaning and thoroughly conscientious people to stamp it out, the
love of the spectacle grows stronger every day. Undoubtedly it has its temptations,
and it is to these rather than to the sport itself that objection is taken; but it may
safely be said that every amusement or game save one—chess —holds out a drugged
cup. Money is not betted on games of chess, no more than a wager would be laid on
a learned professor’s lecture, and yet, without philosophizing or moralizing, cannot it
be truly said that a great deal of time is spent in chess-playing, and time is money, as
the veriest fool will admit. However, as no attempt is made in these pages to write
up an idea, but merely to state historical and biographical facts, it may be observed
that from early times horse-racing has charmed the multitude. It is possible to trace
it back in literature to a very remote period, Homer enumerating, in the twenty-
third book of the Iliad, the various incidents of the chariot race at the funeral games
held in honour of Patroclus, the friend of Achilles, and detailing them with much
vividness—
‘ ‘ In rank they stood : Achilles showed the goal
Far on the level plain, and set thereby
His sire’s attendant, Phoenix, godlike soul,
To mind the course and tell it truthfully.
Then all at once they raised their whips on high,
And smote their horses with the thongs, and cheered
With heartening speech : swiftly the steeds did fly,
Leaving the ships behind: the thick dust, reared
Upright beneath their breasts, like cloud or storm appeared.”
These competitions bear in Homer a semi-religious character, but it is difficult to say
how far they contributed to a practice which soon came to be of national importance.
The Olympic Games, held on the banks of the Alpheus, near Olympia (hence
the name), a city of Elis, to which all the Hellenes came, introduced the four-horse
chariot race as early as the twenty-third Olympiad (b.c. 684), and to this was added,
in the thirty-third Olympiad (b.c. 644), the race with mounted horses. There is no
account of the training or management of the Olympic racehorse, but it is known
that the equestrian candidates were required to enter their names, and send their

horses to Elis, thirty days before the celebration commenced. Frequently the
owners drove their own chariots or rode their own horses, just as we see at the
present day in trotting or racing matches. During the thirty days that the horses
remained at Elis, the charioteers and riders were obliged to undergo a prescribed
form of training and exercise. The passion for horse-racing indulged in by the
Athenians, for example, about the time of Aristophanes (b.c. 423), may be obtained
from the scene with which his play, “ The Clouds,” written in ridicule of Socrates,
opens, where he speaks (Pheidippides is said by Strepsiades to be racing in his
sleep) of “ riding nags and driving curricles.” A stronger proof of the popularity of
the sport is afforded by the significant fact that the Bosetians termed one of their
months, corresponding to the Athenian Hecatombaion, Hippodromius, or horse-
month.
Direct historical evidence fails to show that the ancient Britons practised any
form of this amusement, and yet it is reasonable to suppose that at the time of
Boadicea they would be tempted to test the speed of their horses previous to going
to battle, and perhaps cause them to undergo a preparatory training which would
enable them to withstand the excitement and din of the battle-field.
The Romans were greatly addicted to the sport, which was held in the Circus
Maximus. This building, which is assigned to Tarquinius Prisons, was enlarged by
Caesar, and after having been twice burned down, once in the reign of Claudius, and
again in that of Domitian, who increased its capacity, was completed by Trajan
constructing it to seat 250,000 spectators. Race time, as we should term it, was
always a very festive season with the Romans, and was inaugurated in a manner
unparalleled in modern times. A grand procession, which was of a religious nature,
moved from the Forum to the Circus. After its arrival, the presiding magistrate
gave the signal for the races by throwing a white flag on to the course—a custom
which, no doubt, has given rise to our mode of starting horses. There is a faint
indication of some of the Germanic tribes having from a very early period regarded
horse-racing as a part of their religious services, while it is not at all improbable that
the Romans encouraged the pursuit in Britain, if they did not introduce it. Frequent
discoveries have been made of traces of racecourses belonging to the period of their
occupation, a fact which indicates a knowledge of the sport. r ihat racing in the
Western world must have been greatly practised may be gathered from the strong
protests which the Christian Church at first (about a.d. 100) offered to it, and the
opinions of the celebrated Augustine, bishop of Hippo, and many of the fathers, who
strongly condemned the attendance of their converts at spectacles held in theatre or
circus. Those who performed in them, and sometimes even those who attended
them, were excommunicated ; but the fascinations of a sjiort, the unchristian character
of which was not easily demonstrable, overcame ecclesiastical censure, and ultimately,
in Germany and elsewhere, the old local races appear to have been admitted to a
recognized place among the ceremonies of certain Christian festivals. Previous to
dismissing the history of the origin of racing, it may be stated that the hoise was
held in great reverence by the Israelites. The kings of Israel were forbidden to
multiply them, because they were connected with the worship of the sun. They were
GEORGE JOHN WATSON.


held in such high estimation that they were not used as beasts of burden (asses and
camels being employed for that purpose), but only for chase and war, as cavalry and
in chariots, and they formed the strength of Assyrian and Egyptian armies. In the
Bible the horse is spoken of as being less swift than the ass, which, it is said, neighed
like him, Solomon speaking of the horse requiring the whip and the ass the bridle.
In England, as it is known at the present day, horse-racing was a favourite
pastime as far back as the reign of Richard I. The usual distance was three miles,
and races, which were held at Whitsuntide, were much patronized by the knights,
who used to ride on steeds and palfreys, the prize being “ forty pounds of heavy gold.”
In the time of King John, it would appear that among other items mentioned in the
register of royal expenditure, a certain sum was set apart for the maintenance of
running horses, but there is no evidence to show whether it was given as a subsidy
for horse-racing, or that it was to defray the king’s personal expenses in maintaining
a stud of horses kept for the purpose of racing contests. Edward 111., known as the
Confessor, took great pleasure in keeping a number of racehorses.
Historical evidence fails to show whether public races were established
previous to 1512, in which year they were placed on a firm footing at Chester. In
Henry VIII.’s reign there was always racing on Shrove Tuesday, presumably at the
close of the season when festivities were allowed. In the reign of Elizabeth the
custom seems to have gone very much out of fashion, as the Puritan element was
then gaining the ascendancy, but it is worthy of note that Janies I. ran races at
Croydon and Enfield. In 1607 races were run near York, the prize being a little
golden bell. In the reign of Charles 1., which commenced in 1625, there were still
more marked strides made in turf matters, for the king successfully established racing
at Newmarket; and Queen Anne was so much devoted to horse-racing that she not
only gave royal plates for competition, but ran horses for them in her own name.
From that period up to the present racing has been growing more popular, and its
patrons can be enumerated by millions.
In Australia, as the opening lines of this sketch stated, its patrons are
exceedingly numerous, and amongst its most enthusiastic devotees is Mr. George
John Watson, He was born in June, 1829, at Ballydarton, County Carlow, and is a
specimen of “ the fine old Irish gentleman, one of the olden school.” His father was
the descendant of John Watson, of Salkeld, Cumberland, described by the heralds as
“ of an ancient and honourable family,” having been appointed a commissioner to
enquire into the causes of the Irish rebellion of 1641, and was subsequently resident
at Kilconnor, County Carlow, where he died in 1675. Mr. Watson’s father was a
great lover of the chase, and one of its most enthusiastic patrons, having been master
of the Carlow and Island Hunt. His (Mr. Watson, sen.) portrait, in hunting
costume, executed according to the request of the members of the club in apprecia-
tion of his worth, adorns the walls of the Carlow Club House. He held the dignified
office of High Sheriff for his native county in 1834, and was succeeded at his death
by his son, Robert G. Watson, brother of the subject of this biography. The family
of Watson can lay claim to be a family of sportsmen, whose high ideal of race and
chase always tended to elevate the pastime, and raise it to that standard which, by
GEORGE JOHN WATSON.


its very nature, should be maintained. A rattle across country, over hedges and
ditches, stone walls, five-barred gates, and wide drains, and first in at the death, was
to them a solace for all troubles and worries, Mr. G. J, Watson, who shares the
instincts of the family, could still give a lead, and nothing pleases him better than a
“ rasper.” He sailed from London in the Lord Stanley, and landed in Melbourne in
March, 1850. True to the traditions of his relations, the first thing he did when he
came to Victoria was to buy a steeplechase horse, named “ Wild Harry,” and some
time after a pack of hounds was kept by him, which eventually merged into the
Melbourne hounds. When Mr. Kirk disposed of the business, conducted in the
Bazaar which still retains his name, Mr. Watson took it up, and managed it with
great success, giving much satisfaction to the public by his gentlemanly demeanour,
his business-like habits, and his honesty in all transactions. When he relinquished
this business he went coaching, under the name of Cobb and Co., a firm known far
and wide in Australia. No doubt Mr. Watson could relate many a stirring scene
and many a thrilling incident that he witnessed in the early days of coaching in
Victoria; and his eyes still fire up with animated pleasure when he speaks of the
sensations he used to experience while watching the coaches start. He was also
engaged in squatting pursuits, in the Riverina and Darling districts, which proved a
financial success. He had, in addition, property in Western Port.
To return to Mr. Watson’s career as a sportsman. An inspection of the prizes
he has won is a sufficient indication of his success on the turf and in the field. He
began in 1851, and continued for years afterwards to train and ride his own race-
horses, taking a delight in studying the points of the racer which was to carry him to
victory or defeat, the former of which he acknowledged thankfully, and the latter he
accepted gracefully —two certain signs of a sportsman who always looks at such
matters from a scientific point of view, endeavouring to ascertain how he has lost or
won, rather than blessing his good luck and cursing his bad. Mention has been made
of the numerous trophies he has at his town residence, Fenagh Cottage, Burnett-
street, St. Kilda ; but perhaps the three most interesting in the collection are those
which were carried off on the flat, across the country, and on the trot, a special
honour attaching to them, inasmuch as they are prizes given for the first time, or, to
put it as the schools would render it, “ the first of the first.” They are as follows :
The first Queen’s Plate ever run in Australia was won with the mare called
“ Shadow;” the first Grand National Steeplechase in Tasmania was carried off by
the horse “ Lottery and the first great American Trotting Match inaugurated in
this country by the Americans fell to the lot of the grey mare “ Betty.” Racing in
Australia, especially in Victoria, owes much to the efforts of Mr. Watson, who, with
the late Mr. Harper, Colonel Robbins, and others, was instrumental in putting it on
a sound and proper footing. Mr. Watson is connected, more or less, with the
metropolitan racing clubs in the colony, and was for many years honorary starter.
He is, as is well known, the starter for the V.R.C., and has always secured the
commendation of the press and the public for his skill and fair play in that most
difficult task. His familiar face is seen and easily recognized on every race-
course near and around Melbourne ; and it is very rarely he pays a visit (which
GEORGE JOHN WATSON.


is then a flying one) to his country residence, “ Weathersdane,” five miles beyond
Dandenong. He has never taken any interest in politics, his time and attention
being fully occupied with his own business, and, indeed, demanding it. He is
a member of the several societies connected with matters relating to racing,
and he endeavours earnestly to preserve the tone of the stable. He is the beau
ideal of hospitality in his own house, is straightforward in his actions, a keen
sportsman, and popular on the turf. But, perhaps, if there be one thing more
than another that Mr. Watson’s career can demonstrate it is this—that a gentle-
man may engage in the sports of the turf and the field successfully. He is a
good instance of what he endeavours to teach, thus proving his theory that “a
gentleman once is a gentleman always,” and that ruin and disgrace are not
necessarily the attendants of this, the most popular of all amusements in the
British Empire,

JAMES MACLEAN.
l|N new countries, especially, there is held out to every man an opportunity
mm of acquitting himself honourably in that particular calling which has
fallen to him either by choice or circumstance. Man, however, is the
child of contradiction. The greater his opportunities, the less he embraces them.
Has he wealth ? He despises it, perhaps squanders it. Has he been blessed with
intellect of an high order ? Probably he undervalues it. And so it is with every
gift or endowment, material or immaterial, vouchsafed to him. Wealthy ? Pshaw!
He never will taste poverty. Brilliant ? Why should he plod ? He can draw upon
his immense resources at any time. Nature is a spendthrift. She places at man s
feet advantages innumerable, and it is for man to stoop and pick them up. She has
done so in Australia, but as every virtue has its opposite vice, it may chance that, in
a country where there is so much scope, there may be, and often is, a corresponding
disposition to become indifferent, and lead an aimless and useless life. Hence the
merit due to those who by energy, patience, prudence, and skill have gained the
esteem of their fellow-men.
Such a one is Mr. James Maclean, who was born on December 10th, 1826,
in County Tyrone, North of Ireland. His ancestors, members of that portion of the
clan Maclean, known as the house of Loughbuy, came from Scotland to Ireland in
the early part of the seventeenth century, and settled in the County Monaghan, whence
his father, a farmer, removed to Tyrone about the beginning of the present century.
His early days were spent at the ordinary school in the village of Dyan, the well
known seat of Number 1 Orange Lodge, whose regalia he has often handled, and
with whose officers and men he was on familiar terms. That neither he, nor his
brothers, nor any of his ancestors, who lived in such stirring times when party spirit
and religious animosity ran so high in Ireland, could be induced by threats or
persuasion to join any of the secret societies then in existence, has always seemed a
matter of surprise, but it speaks volumes for their sturdy independence and self-reliance.
Mr. Maclean, having been intended by his father for the ministry of the
Presbyterian Church, was sent to the preparatory school kept by the Revd. John
Bleckley, M.A., at Monaghan. At this school the following well and favourably known
colonists were educated —Sir C. G. Duffy, David Blair, the late Professor McCoy, of
Ballaarat, Francis Longmore, that pleasing writer, the late N. Walter Swan, and the
Rev. J. Paten, M.A., of Hawthorn —the two last named being school-fellows of Mr.
Maclean. In the winter of 1846 he began his University course at Glasgow by
entering the senior Greek class under Dr. Lushington, and the class of Logic under
Professor Buchanan. In 1848 Mr. Maclean abandoned the idea of entering the


Church, as his father died in that year, and left behind him a numerous family.
Mr. Maclean was, shortly after this period, elected principal of the classical and
mathematical Academy in Omagh, the capital of his native county. Disliking the
work of tuition, and hearing reports of the wonderful discoveries ol gold in Australia,
he, like a good many young men with whom he came in,contact, was eager to try his
fortune at searching for the precious metal, and accordingly took passage for Melbourne
in the good ship “Marco Polo,” which sailed from Liverpool, and, after a voyage
of seventy-seven days, cast anchor in Hobson’s Bay, on June Ist, 1853.
His first occupation after landing was that of assistant to the Revd. W. B.
Miller, who kept a boarding-school for boys in Spring-street. About the beginning of
September, Doctor Hunter and a few of his other shipmates came to him at Mr.
Miller’s and persuaded him to join them in making up a party to go to the diggings.
They pitched their tents on Barker’s Creek, Castlemaine, and there first saw gold
dug out of the earth. After trying Barker’s Creek, Forest Creek, and other places
around Castlemaine with indifferent success, most of his party became disheartened —
one returning to the medical and another to the legal profession. Mr. Maclean, however,
joined other mates, and visited Avoca, Tarrangower, Back Creek, Daisy Hill, Yandoit
and other places, spending, in all, at actual digging, about three years —sometimes
doing fairly well, but more frequently having poor luck. The diggers in those days were
mostly young men, from twenty to thirty years of age, well born, well bred, and highly
educated. On every goldfield were to be met members of this or that University,
whose coarse garb and unkempt appearance gave no indication of their connections
or attainments, but who were, nevertheless, able to discuss subjects of the highest
importance, whether literary, scientific, or political, with an ability that at once
showed no ordinary fund of information, culture, and special training. Moreover, for
classical and mathematical knowledge, literary and scientific abilities, energy, pluck,
perseverance, and enterprise, the population of the goldfields at that time has
seldom, if ever, been equalled, and never surpassed at any period or in any country.
The life of a digger among such a class of men was a reckless, roving, rollicking one,
replete with many sources of enjoyment, without care or anxiety. If the sinews of
war were wanted a few hours’ labour with a pick, shovel, and tin dish procured
sufficient for the day’s requirements, but still the fortune which each one hoped and
expected to make, kept as distant as ever, and gradually the conviction began to force
itself on the mind, that at such employment no sure provision for accident, sickness,
or old age could with certainty be expected. Acting upon this conviction Mr.
Maclean turned his attention to storekeeping, and in pursuit of this business visited
Dunolly and Ararat.
At Dunolly, in 1856-57, he first took a part in local government, when what
was known as the Committee of Progress was elected at a public meeting of the
storekeepers, for the purpose of looking after and improving the streets. Mr. Maclean
was one of those chosen, and after a little while became the chairman, the secretary
being Mr. Frank Quinlan, now an able judge of the County Court, and Chairman of
the General Sessions.


In June, 1857, Mr. Maclean came to Ararat on the breaking out of the Canton
lead, which by its enormous richness attracted population from every gold-field in
Victoria, besides a great many from South Australia. The approaches to Ararat, as
well as the streets of the Canvas Town, were in a deplorable state that winter, owing
to the immense traffic and the great rainfall. Some of the streets were just liquid
mud from six to eight and ten inches deep, so that approaching the front of a store,
or locomotion in any frequented part, became almost impossible to pedestrians.
With the view of remedying this state of things, the idea of the Committee of
Progress was again suggested, and here also Mr. Maclean’s services were secured.
Although then absent spending his honeymoon—just having been married to Miss
Spears—he was chosen a member of the Committee, and appointed chairman. The
Committee at once set vigorously to work, and by going from store to store, they
collected funds sufficient to make the old main street, which ran past Foos’s Golden
Age Hotel, while over the creek, lying between that street and the site of the present
town, they built a log bridge, which remains until this day. The Committee of
Progress also entered into correspondence with the Government, requesting that
special attention be paid to the claims of the district, and urging that some
responsible person should inspect it. They ultimately secured a visit from Mr.
O’Shanassy, the Chief Secretary of the colony, who was so much impressed with the
stability and importance of the goldfield and its imperative needs, that, on his return
to Melbourne, he sent Mr. Thomas Higinbotham, then Inspector-General of Loads
and Bridges, to see what works were most required, and to take steps to have them
carried into effect as soon as possible. When it is borne in mind that there was at
that time in Ararat a population variously estimated at from thirty to fifty
thousand, that there was not a chain of made road, a bridge or culvert between it
and the sea at Portland and Warrnambool, nor between it and Ballarat or
Castlemaine, and that flour was from T4O to TSO per ton, hay £35 per
ton, oats twenty-five to thirty shillings per bushel, bran three shillings and
sixpence per bushel, with all other things in proportion, it will be admitted
that the complaints and pleadings of the Progress Committee were not without
cause. Mr. Higinbotham came, and after several interviews with the Committee,
decided on the building of the stone bridge over the Hopkins, at Sandy Lang’s
hotel, near Boss’s station, and the building of the Bobie’s Bridge, as well as
the construction of the road from Ararat to Dobie’s Bridge. Another of the results
of Mr. O’Shanassy’s visit was the survey of the site of the present township by Mr.
Geo. Langford, the District Surveyor. The Progress Committee, immediately after
the survey and sale of the town allotments, took every opportunity of impressing on
the residents the importance of having Ararat made a municipality. A petition was
drawn up, and forwarded with signatures to the Governor-in-Council, and, on the 20th
September, 1858, they had the satisfaction of seeing a proclamation in the Government
Gazette, raising Ararat to the position of a municipality. In the winter of 1858
His Excellency Sir Henry Barkly paid a visit to Ararat, which he reached—
since there were neither roads or railways —by sailing from Melbourne to


Portland, and thence overland. Having ascertained that he would arrive at Ararat on a
certain day, a large number of the principal people went out on horseback to meet him;
when they reached Sandy Creek two gentlemen were seen, also on horseback
coming along a bush track, who proved to be His Excellency, with his aide-de-camp,
Captain Bancroft. After a hearty greeting he was escorted into the town, where
loyal addresses were presented, and a grand ball held in his honour.
It will, doubtless, be interesting to record the principal public institutions that
were in existence about this time in Ararat, together with the names ot those who
took leading positions. The courts were : the Police Court, presided over by Mr.
Corry Weston; the Warden’s Court, presided over by Mr. James Grant Taylor, who
still holds the position of Police Magistrate in the Warrnanibool district; the
Mining Board, with Mr. Thomas M‘Ewan as chairman, and containing among its
members Mr. William M‘Lennan, shortly afterwards elected a member of the
Legislative Assembly for Ararat, which he has continued to represent ever since,
except for a short period of five years. Mr. R. G. Berry was Receiver and
Paymaster, and Mr. Winch the Superintendent of Police. The Barristers were
Messrs. Boyle, Haynes, Sirr, and Lament; while the attorneys were
Messrs. Owen, Tripp, and Paynter. The medical profession was numerously
represented, of whom the names, among others, of Doctors Girdieston, Galbraith,
and Law may be mentioned. The churches were: the Church of England,
with the Rev. Phillip Homan as incumbent, who still retains his position, ministering
to a large and influential congregation ; the Presbyterian, with the Rev. William
Mclntosh, who, after labouring among his people with great acceptability for about
a year, died in the early part of 1860, universally mourned. The spiritual wants of
the Roman Catholics were attended to by the Rev. Thomas Barratt as parish priest,
while the Wesleyans had a small building and a considerable number of adherents,
but no settled minister at that time nor for many years afterwards. The first public
school belonged to the Church of England, was under the Denominational Board,
and had for its master Mr. Thomas Williams, who afterwards became Inspector of
Schools in the Province of Wellington, New Zealand. In a short time the
Presbyterians and Roman Catholics had schools of their own, which were also under
the Denominational Board. After a few years an effort was made to unite all these
schools under a committee, representative of the different religious denominations,
which was effected, Father Barratt, on behalf of the Roman Catholics, alone refusing
to join. This attempt at bringing all the children of a locality into one large school,
which was originated by Mr. Maclean a considerable time before it was accomplished,
was ridiculed by some of the most prominent men then in the district; but his powerful
advocacy of the plan on the platform and through the Press attracted the attention of our
public men, and subsequently found legislative recognition in the Common Schools Act.
The head master of this combined school was Mr. R. Welch, against whom an adverse
feeling was entertained by some members of the committee, who tried to drive him
away, but, fortunately, were unable, much to their own satisfaction eventually, as
Mr. Welch proved himself a most efficient teacher, and at present conducts one
of the most important schools in the colony,


There were two newspapers, one of which The Ararat and Pleasant Grech Advertiser,
published by Messrs. Nuttall and Banfield, still survives and flourishes, under the
managership and proprietorship of Mr. Banfield. The first municipal council for
Ararat was elected on the 20th October, 1858, before Mr. Lament, barrister-at-law,
who was appointed returning officer by the Government for that purpose, and
Messrs. Maclean and McCormick, assessors. The contest for seats was very keen, a
large number presenting themselves for election, from whom Messrs. Fred Lowe, Adam
Davidson, Michael Kerr, Joseph Chadwick, William Wilson —afterwards M.P. for the
district —Joseph Richardson, and Mr. Frederick Gamson were chosen. Mr. Lowe
was elected the first chairman, and at the first meeting of the council Mr. Maclean was
chosen by six out of seven votes for the position of Town Clerk; Mr. Michael
Herbert was made Town Surveyor. Immediately on the new councillors taking
office they engaged themselves actively in the construction of streets and
rights-of-way, the making of footpaths, and pitching and kerbing channels. Shortly
afterwards a County Court and Court of General Sessions were established at
Ararat, James Langton Clarke being appointed resident judge, and John Yates
made sheriff. A gaol was built, a Supreme Court district proclaimed, a Court-house
erected, and the court opened by Sir Redmond Barry. The borough of Ararat is
situated on one of the eastern spurs of the Great Dividing Range, and except on its
southern side, is entirely surrounded by mountains. It is over one thousand
feet above the level of the sea. From the hill to the west of the town may be
seen Mounts William, Abrupt, Sturgeon, Cole, Lange-Ghian, Ben Nevis, Ararat,
and Moornambool, immediately south of which the Pyrenees fall down into the plains.
Its situation ensures good natural drainage, and consequent immunity from many of
the numerous diseases arising from a defect of that description. For bold, varied
and picturesque scenery, it is unsurpassed, and is considered by travellers as one of
the most charming situations for a town anywhere to be found. Its moderate distance
from the Southern Ocean, without a hill intervening, always secures a cool,
invigorating breeze for it during the summer nights, whilst its being sheltered by the
Dividing Range from a large portion of the fierce hot winds, combine to render it one of
the most healthful and pleasant places in “ Australia Felix.” Doctor Henderson, who
as an army surgeon for several years, had travelled in many countries, described its
climate as a “ perpetual joy,” and affirmed it to be his belief that at no distant date
it would be one of the great sanatoriums of Australia. In 1801 the country around
Ararat was proclaimed a road district, with a managing board, to which the following
gentlemen were elected; —W. R. Mitchell, John Spears, Thomas Flatterly, John
Cousins, Joseph H. Marshall, John Allthorp, William Williams, and Hugh
Dairy mple.
At this time the whole country from Elmhurst to Streatham was Crown lands,
in the occupation of squatters, without road or bridge, and only a horse paddock
around their houses fenced.
The assessed value to the Road Board was £5,489, and in proportion as it was
selected under the Land Acts ot 1802 and 1805, it mcieased in \alue, until in 18/4


the assessments amounted to <4114,357, thus showing the value of the same land
when held by the State, and when owned by private individuals. In 1804 the Koad
District was made a shire, containing 1401 square miles, the annual revenue of which
is at present about £12,000 with a population of 5,500, and number of properties
assessed amounting to 1400. Since its formation it has carried out 1,500 contracts,
which consisted in making 300 miles of roads with the necessary bridges and
culverts, at a cost of <£204,000. On the proclamation of the Koad District, Mr. Maclean
was elected from among a large number of competitors, and when the shire was
formed, he was appointed its secretary—an office which he has continued to
hold ever since.
When the Municipal Association of Victoria was formed in 1879 Mr. Maclean’s
services in that respect were recognised, and he was unanimously elected secretary
to the Ballarat group. On the formation of the Decentralisation League at the great
meeting of the municipalities held in Ballarat towards the latter end of the year 1885,
Mr. Maclean was chosen as one of the committee of ten, whose business it was to
bring the matter prominently before the public, and have its principles recognised at
the ensuing general election. Of the position he holds in the esteem of those best
qualified to judge from their long and intimate knowledge of him, and through being
brought into personal contact with him, the following few extracts from the
numerous certificates he received when he applied, a few years ago, for the
office of secretary to the Tramway Trust, Melbourne, will amply show. Mr. Forbes,
president of the Ararat shire, writes:—Mr. Maclean has been secretary to the shire
of Ararat for twenty-two years, and treasurer for fifteen years. I have much
pleasure in bearing testimony to the very able and efficient manner in which he
has discharged the duties of those offices. lam confident there is but one opinion in
this district as to his high abilities as a business man and efficient officer, and it
is with the deepest regret I learn he is desirous of severing his connection with
this shire.” Mr. Henderson, the Secretary of the Municipal Association of
Victoria, writes '“ There are few persons in Victoria who, like him, can point to
about twenty years’ continuous service as secretary to one of the largest and most
important shires, having at all times, and in all the numerous changes of its
individual constitution, the full confidence of the Council and of the ratepayers;
these are facts I can certify of my own knowledge, having been a councillor of the
shire for over ten years previous to my removal to Melbourne.” Mr. Flatterly,
Mayor of Ararat, writes :—“ I have known Mr. James Maclean for over twenty years,
and have much pleasure in bearing testimony to the great abilities he possesses;
he is a sound and logical reasoner, energetic and strong in argument, and the first
man in the district to whom both the Borough and Shire Councils go for advice in
Municipal matters ; a very able writer and correspondent, and a gentleman in every
sense. Ido not know a man in Victoria who could fill the position with more
credit.” Mr. Pinch, President of the Lexton Shire, writes:—“ I have always
found him a first-class officer—one of the best for public business I ever met; his
ability, energy, honesty, and tact for public business cannot be beaten,” Mr,

Mackielian, Chairman of the Municipal Association, writes :—“I have no hesitation
in saying I have seen none who could surpass him in a clear and distinct
understanding of all duties connected with local government.” Doctor Scott
writes ;—“ I have known Mr. Maclean for many years, and can testify to his great
abilities. I consider him to be, without exception, the most honourable, upright,
and trustworthy gentleman I have ever known.” Mr. Swan, editor of the Pleasant
Creek News, writes : —“ I have known Mr. Maclean for over thirty years. I have not
met with any correspondent who in business matters can equal him in terseness,
clearness, and tact, nor do I know any who are gifted with the power of grasping
such subjects as those pertaining to the duties to which he has devoted himself.”
Mr. Powell, the editor of the Ballarat Star, writes :—“He is an exceptionally good
worker—clear-headed, shrewd, and indefatigable in all his undertakings, and highly
fitted for any part requiring sound judgment, good tact, and unswerving fidelity.”

numbers amongst her increasing population a great many
men who have in their various callings endeavoured to so acquit
themselves as to become indispensable members of Society.
Mr. J. B. Milton, of Messrs. J. B. Milton and Co,, Military Tailors and
Habit Makers, Collins-street East, is one who, we judge, deserves some slight
recognition of his career of usefulness pursued in a steady and progressive
manner. A man by a certain line of conduct can make himself a necessity,
and that this gentleman has done so may be inferred from the fact that his
services as a colonist have been much appreciated. Trained in the foremost schools
ot fashion, ho cannot be classed amongst those who declare themselves as authorities
in fashion and good workmanship, without a certificate testamatory of long experience
and careful training. Fashion is fickle, and he who is a real authority must possess
brains capable of controlling the vagaries of the giddy dame. Mr. Milton, after a
residence of 34 years in Melbourne, and following an occupation in which so many
tastes require strict study, can rest assured that the large and increasing trade carried
on under his supervision is evidence, if it were needed, of the satisfaction he has
hitherto given. He served his apprenticeship in his native town, Liverpool, and
afterwards entered the establishment of Messrs. McGee, St. James Street, Dublin.
After spending some time in this establishment, he left under engagement to one of
the first-class establishments in Paris. After studying for some time the Parisian
fashions, he commenced business in the West End of London, where he remained 10
years, doing business on an extensive scale, but on account of failing health he was
advised to give up business there, and immigrate to the more genial and less trying
climate of Australia.
In the year 1853 he arrived in Victoria by the ship “Madagascar,” and shortly
afterwards commenced business in Collins-street, Melbourne, in a stone building
nearly opposite his present establishment. In those days Melbourne was a
comparatively small city, and had not her streets lined with the piles of huge and
handsome buildings now so common. There were a few stone buildings of a decent
size in Collins-street, but the majority were of a modest and unpretentious description.
Increase of trade involved increase of space, and Mr. J. B. Milton, the leading partner,
found it necessary to obtain more commodious premises. The firm, which has
secured the patronage of His Excellency the Governor, occupies the establishment
situated a few doors from the comer of Swanston-street, and nearly opposite the Age
office. The business he transacts is principally with a substantial class, chiefly the
leading professional and business men. His shop presents a modest appearance, and
an absence of all attempt to advertise by imposing window displays.

HON. LOUIS LAWRENCE SMITH, M.D., I.L.A.
.rWSP w^ien ie poetical arena is simply looked upon, by the majority of
Mi those who enter it, as the first rung in a ladder that is to help them in
attaining a position that is eventually to place them in the Ministry, to
admit the prefix of the word “ Honourable,” and possibly to secure the bestowal of a
colonial knighthood, a consistent politician is by no means to be very frequently met
with. In wooing popularity—and popularity is the means to an end —one has almost
constantly to adapt himself to circumstances, and alter his views and principles to
suit his constituents, who might be Liberals to-day and Conservatives to-morrow.
Consistency, particularly in a representative of Liberals, it must be acknowledged, is
a matter of great difficulty, for the section of the community which goes to make up
that class has never gained the distinction of being amenable to reason when its
immediate interest is supposed to be at stake. With that short-sighted policy which
acknowledges no action right that in the slightest degree varies from a preconceived
idea, the “ working man,” as he is called, refuses to believe that any measure which
does not produce the immediate result that he anticipates must be damnatory to the
country at large. Thus it happens that trimming and veering are so much studied,
and that politicians who aim at popularity gain the unenviable notoriety of becoming
stigmatised as political weathercocks. Taking a retrospective glance at the history
of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, we find that one of the oldest living members
of that body has achieved the right of being recognised as a thoroughly independent
and consistent representative, and a gentleman who has helped largely in the prosperity
of the colony of Victoria.
Louis Lawrence Smith, the son of Mr. E. T. Smith, of London, who was
looked upon by the British public as one of the most enterprising men of his day,
was born in 1830, in London, and commenced his studies at St. Saviour’s Grammar
School. Having completed his preliminary education, he was transferred to the
Ecole de Medicine at Paris. Both his maternal and paternal ancestors distinguished
themselves in the naval engagements of Great Britain, and obtained high positions in
the British Navy. Descended from a fighting race, Dr. Smith, during the French
Revolution of 1848, could not resist the temptation of taking part in the fight that
resulted, and was mentioned in the London Times as “ the young Englishman who
was carried on the shoulders of the people, at the time Louis Phillippe escaped from
France.” He was twice caught by the garde municipals, and twice rescued by the
Republicans during the fighting in the streets. On leaving Paris Dr. Smith returned
to London, and entered himself at the Westminster Hospital, where he distinguished
himself by gaining the first prize for Medicine, Botany, Midwifery, Medical
Jurisprudence, and Chemistry, besides many honorary certificates. Having obtained
his diploma, he commenced practice in London; but news of the discovery of gold


in Australia reaching him about that time, he accepted the appointment of surgeon
to the ship “ Oriental,” and came to Victoria. His experience as a digger was not
a happy one, and relinquishing the idea of realising a fortune in that manner, he
returned to Melbourne and started practice in Bourke Street. In 1859 he was
requested to allow himself to be nominated in the Liberal interest for South Bourke,
consented, and was returned to Parliament. On five other occasions for the same
district he was re-elected and returned at the head of the poll. Though terse in manner,
his speeches on all the leading questions of the day were always incisive, and secured
the attention of the Chamber. On one occasion he resented what he considered an
intentional insult from a Minister of the Crown by boxing the Minister’s ears in the
House, and despite the repeated requests of Mr. R. Heales, who was then the leader
of the Opposition, resigned his seat, but was renominated and returned without the
least personal canvass on his part. As exemplifying his independence and tenacity
of purpose when satisfied with regard to the integrity of that purpose, it might be
stated that in connection with the Darling Grant controversy, of which mention has
been made elsewhere in this volume, Dr. Smith, although requested by his
constituents to support the movement, took an active part in opposing the McCulloch
Ministry on that point, electing to lose his seat rather than retain it at the cost of
the sacrifice of his principles. As a matter of course, he was rejected at the following
election. Dr. Smith then offered himself to the Richmond constituency, and was
elected with the late Hon. J. G. Francis. During the debate on the Parliamentary
Reform Bill submitted by Mr. Francis, and better known as the Norwegian scheme,
he opposed the measure, emphatically stating at the time that it would never become
law, and was in consequence rejected at the next election, securing, however, a
triumph in being returned at the head of the poll for the same constituency at the
general election in 1877. In fostering the interests of the agricultural, pastoral, and
manufacturing classes, he has always advocated the entire irrigation of the colony,
and attempted to induce the Assembly to consent to the borrowing of money for
that object. Probably no individual member in the House has done the country
such good service as Dr. Smith, Among his various works might be mentioned the
Bill for the regulation and preservation of fisheries and the reduction of the
fishermen’s license ; the Game Amendment Act; the amended postal system, which
reduced the rate from fourpence to twopence ; the initiation of the penny postal
cards; and his advocacy of a fish market, for which he received the thanks of the
Corporation of Melbourne. He likewise carried in 1878 in the Legislative Assembly
a resolution for the postage on all inland letters to be reduced to one penny.
He built the Polytechnic Institute in Bourke Street, hoping to make it
rival its London prototype, but failed to arouse the interest of the Melbourne public
in the matter. Notwithstanding the great call on his time, Dr. Smith devoted some
attention to literary affairs, and is the author of a large number of works, as also
proprietor and part proprietor of several newspapers advocating Liberal principles.
He was for several years proprietor of the Australian Journal, and was the first to
edit and publish a Medical Journal in Victoria,
HON. LOUIS LAWRENCE SMITH, M.D., M.L.A.


Few countries in the world have so many natural advantages as Victoria for
the production ol wines ol the finest quality. The soil is in every way suitable, and
in the variety of favourable aspects which its surface presents for vineyards, there are
all the desiderata that could be imagined. Its climate, however, offers in a peculiar
degree a field of surpassing excellence for the cultivation of the vine. Possessing,
then, every element of success for this important branch of industry (wine
manufacturing), it is deplorable to state that, although it cannot be said exactly to
have languished, it certainly has not until recently made that progress which might
have been looked forward to. The spirit of unbelief abroad as to the possibility of
the production of superior wine in Victoria, or rather in Australia, was, however,
effectually exploded by the judgments of the best experts in Europe, given at the
various International Exhibitions in Vienna, London, and Paris. The fact of the
recently acquired high reputation, and the consequent encouraging effect upon the
industry in Victoria, might without hesitation be accredited in a great measure to
the “ father of the industry Dr. L. L. Smith—who founded it in 1879. For the
past few years he has almost caused a revolution in the wine market. He had
several vineyards in different parts of the colony, and the grapes and wines selected
for the production of champagne were under the supervision of Monsieur Dargent,
a thorough adept in the production of that article, and whom Dr. Smith
engaged in Paris. Dr. Smith’s samples of Victorian champagne competed
with upwards of a hundred varieties of that wine of European celebrity at the
International Exhibition held in 1880-81, and were awarded equal prizes with Krug
and Co., the fiat of the judges being that the only brands which equalled his and
surpassed them slightly were “ Roederer ” and “ Cliquot.” A great deal of interest
was evinced by the Duke of Manchester, when he was on his first visit to Australia,
in colonial industries; and when offered some of the wine manufactured by the
doctor, expressed his surprise on tasting the same, unqualifiedly endorsing the
opinion of the wine jury that had spoken so highly of his samples. In proof that the
Victorians are not altogether unmindful of the benefits conferred on them by the
doctor, it needs only to be stated that on one occasion, at a banquet given by the
Murray Vine Growers’ Association at Rutherglen, he was presented with a solid gold
bottle, which had a magnificent diamond to represent the cork.
In 1880, on the dissolution of Parliament, it was contended by the Liberal
section of the community that Mr. Service and his friends were attempting to
destroy the Constitution, root and branch. It was asserted that although the
Constitution provided for two Houses of Legislature, Mr. Service’s Reform Bill
attempted to provide for three. The Constitution was innocent of a double
dissolution or a joint sitting, or the right of the Council to alter Appropriation Bills.
All these were foreign to the Constitution in spirit and letter. The difference in the
schemes proposed for Reform by Messrs. Berry and Service might be realised from
the following:—Mr. Berry’s scheme included the voting by all ratepayers; the
eligibility of all ratepayers as members ; the term of office six years, one-third of
the members retiring every two years ; thirty electorates, with one member each;
HON. LOUIS LAWRENCE SMITH, M.D., M.L.A.


the then Council to be dissolved at the death of the next Assembly; and the
privileges of the Assembly in finance to be those of the House of Commons. Mr.
Service’s Reform scheme, on the other hand, embraced the following:—Only
ratepayers with a .£lO freehold and £2O leasehold qualification to vote ; only persons
with an income of £l5O a year from freeholds to be eligible as members ; the term
of office to be ten years; twelve electorates, with forty-two members; the
Council to retire only as under the then existing Constitution; a two-thirds vote
of the Council to prevent the Assembly sending up a money vote except in a
separate bill; double dissolution; joint sitting, and power of amendments. The
contrast was striking. To ears that had been trained to nothing that was not
constitutional in the strict sense of the word, the double dissolution and joint sitting
sounded very strange, and the Liberals emphatically urged that the Conservatives
were the actual revolutionists, who were inviting the country to make an experiment
in a thoroughly unconstitutional direction.
At this critical juncture Dr. Smith contested the important constituency of
Richmond for a seat in the Legislative Assembly. In commenting on his rejection
at the last election, he attributed his defeat to bribery and other unfair influences.
He expressed the opinion that the resumption of office by the Conservatives would
simply mean the destruction of the Protection policy of the country, and the creation
of a hostile feeling between the workingmen and the shopkeepers. The Conservative
portion of the Press and the supporters of Mr. Service’s Government had decried
the plebiscite, but after eighteen days’ sitting of the Assembly Mr. Service had
urged the Governor to grant a dissolution and an appeal to the country. This very
act, Dr. Smith urged, was but the adoption of the plebiscite. Referring to the short
term of office of the Service Government, he characterised their conduct as
unconstitutional in the extreme. They had delayed the meeting of Parliament, and
on their own responsibility had discharged high officials and repealed regulations
which had been adopted by the previous Parliament. He strenuously opposed the
Reform scheme launched by Mr, Service, on account of the almost illimitable power
bestowed on the Upper House. Saving sundry restrictions, he saw no objection
to the double dissolution; but the joint sitting, in his opinion, verged on
a farce. He favoured the Liberal Reform Bill, and stated that deadlocks had arisen
through the rejection of measures by incompetent men in the Council.
When Parliament dissolved and the Service Administration held the reins of
Government, Dr. Smith was out of the House for three months ; but on the ousting
of the Conservative Ministry and the re-instatement of the Berry Government, he,
at the earnest solicitation of an influential deputation, stood for Richmond, and was
returned by an overwhelming majority. During the session Mr. Berry’s attempt to
coalesce with the Opposition dissatisfied him, and induced him subsequently to move
a vote of want of confidence against his leader. The motion was negatived by five
votes only. He then accorded his support to Sir Bryan O’Loghlen, finding that
Mr. Berry coquetted about a Reform measure. On the O’Loghlen Government
coming into power, Dr. Smith was offered a choice of portfolios, but refused all
HON. LOUIS LAWRENCE SMITH, M.D., M.L.A


appointments that carried emolument, eventually accepting a portfolio without
salary. During the Berry Administration he obtained the appointment of a Select
Committee to investigate and report upon phylloxera in vines. Of this committee
Dr. Smith was chairman, and upon the report furnished by it, the law in regard
to phylloxera vastatrix is founded. He also obtained the appointment of a Select
Committee to report upon the disease in stock, and this was accepted as a basis on
which was drafted the Diseases in Stock Bill.
Dr. Smith acted as president of the Royal Commission in connection with
wine at Bordeaux and Amsterdam, and was inducted into the chair in connection
with the Wine, Grain, and Fruit Industrial Exhibition, which was carried out by
public subscription. In his capacity as Chairman of the Exhibition Trustees he
advocated the establishment of an aquarium and a fernery, and the carrying out
of his suggestions in these respects with his fellow-trustees has materially added to
the beauty and attractiveness of the Exhibition. He introduced calf vaccine lymph
into the colony.
In order to prove to the people of Victoria what could really be done in the
way of farming, he established a model farm, on which he expended over <£20,000.
On this farm he rears pure-bred sheep, pigs, and thorough-bred horses, for all of
which he has obtained numerous prizes. His racing establishment is well known, and
its extent might be realised from the fact that he has no less than thirteen
horses in training. Although a constant stake winner, he rarely bets, running his
horses merely for the prizes.
On the occasion when he was requested to stand for Mornington, Richmond
having rejected him for moving the want of confidence motion, he was opposed by
five candidates, of whom Mr. Justice Webb and Mr. Frank Madden were two. He
was, however, returned at the head of the poll. Since then Dr. Smith has made a
tour of Europe, America, and Canada, and though on pleasure bent, remembered the
Victorians, as evidenced in the numerous suggestions conveyed through the Press for
the welfare of the industries of the colony.
Dr. Smith has recently been elected Vice-President of the Chamber of
Manufactures, and has been deputed as one of five from that chamber to meet other
delegates at Adelaide from the different colonies to initiate Intercolonial Freetrade.
The energy, enterprise, and perseverance of the Honourable Doctor are
thoroughly acknowledged throughout the colonies, and perhaps known
nowhere than in Victoria, where he has secured a very extensive practice. It
is currently reported, and not denied, that he expends over £3OOO a year in
advertising.


HON. JAMES SWAN, M.L.C., QUEENSLAND.
4^H^ EFOEE Eie stlld y °f names 5 say philologists, can profit, we are laid under
elwil ■ a necessity to become acquainted with the way in which the formation of
words is effected. What is true of names is true of men and women, an
intelligent study of their lives only becoming possible from a true acquaintance with
the manner in which the formation of those lives was effected. It would be
impossible, as well as unprofitable and tedious, to take into account every incident in
a man’s life, in order to arrive at a true conception of him; as well might the
sculptor he expected to exhibit in his productions every vein in the human body.
The artist is only required to represent his subject in such a manner as will suffice
to convey a clear idea of form, although it must be borne in mind that in different
attitudes and positions, the outline undergoes certain modifications or changes, as a
stroll through any Art Gallery will testify. As it is with the artist, so is it with the
biographer. The circumstances, to use the word in a technical sense, need only his
serious attention —those which mainly contribute to give effect, and which are so
prominent as to cause the student to carry away with him a comprehensive idea. To
carry the analogy a little further—When a landscape is surveyed, nothing is
contemplated but the chief features, and yet it is universally known that these are
more distinctly grasped by means of the less prominent. Every biographer is an
artist in his way, and it is his duty, in the execution of his work, to give a truthful
pen portrait, no responsibility attaching to him other than that of adhering strictly
to the chiaroscuro of the original. In short, he must act the part of Francisco de
Herrera, of whom Cean-Bernudez relates a story he heard whilst at Seville.
Francisco was a man of such gloomy disposition that everyone deserted him. At
one time he had a great many works on hand, and having no pupil to assist him, he
charged an old servant, the only human being he could keep in his house, to put the
first layer of colour on his pictures. The woman took a tow-brush and smeared them
on the canvas at random; then Herrera continued the work, and drew from this
chaos draperies, limbs, and faces.
In describing the careers of colonists and colonials, there is a strong temptation
to overdraw the picture, because it is impossible to withhold admiration of the
qualities which the men who have made the country possess; and it can be truly said
that the Hon. James Swan is one of those to whom the palm must be given, as he
has ever striven in a disinterested manner to further the interests of Australia.
Scotchmen, it is said, are impervious to wit, unless a surgical operation is undergone.
This opinion mayor may not be true, but what they lack in ability to see a joke is
compensated for in strength of character to accomplish that which other nationalities
would shrink from attempting. To this class belongs the Hon. James Swan, who has


in an unobtrusive manner raised himself from a humble position to one of
responsibility and trust. There is among certain sections of the community a
morbid thirst for detraction of public men, which can be attributed either to jealousy
or inability to appreciate true worth. The most disinterested man is the butt of such
half-fledged thinkers, who can only see in the rising sun a golden guinea;
and how few of them, as that great art critic, John Ruskin, asked some
few years ago, do see the rising sun ? Why, they sleep their
brains away! Public men must undergo the ordeal of criticism, but vulgar
abuse and intelligent criticism differ materially. In every country a healthy
public opinion is essential, but that is only brought about by the leaders in religion
and politics letting their light so shine that their works may be pronounced good.
It is not necessary to be clothed in garish garments nor to boast of a noble ancestry,
for he who leans upon the pillars of an ancient house some day finds out they are but
poor supports ; it is not necessary to have the power to clothe our ideas with “ fine
linen and purple,” for frequently it happens that pomp of language implies poverty of
thought; but it is necessary to be able to point to the annals of our lives, and
challenge the world to place a finger on a stain in our characters.
The Hon. James Swan was born in Glasgow in 1811, and found himself when
twelve years of age with only two relations alive —one a motherless cousin, and the
other a niece, who is now a nonogenarian. All the education he received then and
since was obtained through his own industry. After struggling for a livelihood in
two or three kinds of employment, he was eventually bound for seven years as
apprentice to the printing business. He is one more instance of the number of those
belonging to the Press who have risen to an honourable and responsible position. It
can claim as members of its ranks lawyers and politicians of the greatest eminence,
and it is remarkable that the most successful editors are those who have handled
and used what modern machinery has supplanted—the “ hand-roller.” Thirty-four
of the present members of the House of Commons occupy, or have occupied, the
editorial chair, and it is matter for congratulation that the Queensland Legislature
possesses at least one who has passed his early days in a printing office. When Mr.
Swan was in his second year as a journeyman, the Rev. Dr. Lang, who came in 183G
on a visit to Glasgow, heard of him, and, desiring to procure good workmen, called at
the office where he was engaged, and succeeded in inducing him to emigrate to
Sydney, under agreement to receive constant employment in his (Dr. Lang’s) printing
office, with the highest rate of wages. He arrived in Sydney in company with Dr. Lang
on December 3, 1837, just as Governor Sir Richard Bourke was leaving the colony.
After three years’ service on the Colonist newspaper, of which (as is well known)
Dr. Lang was proprietor, and whose columns were largely used as the exponent of
his own views on politics and immigration, Mr. Swan undertook, for a short time,
farming, in the Illawarra district. From the pen to the ploughshare was a singular
change, and it would be matter of surprise if the venture could have turned
out otherwise than unprofitable. Mr. Swan attributes his failure in making
agriculture pay to the very low condition of the colony, and to the small returns for


farm produce and other industries which obtained in 1843-4. When the Colonist
ceased in 1841, he was employed on the Sydney Herald, then owned by Messrs.
Stokes and Stevens, the late Mr. John Fairfax becoming proprietor about two years
later. Mr. Swan, nothing daunted at his previous ill-success in agricultural pursuits,
again attempted farming in the Wollongong district, with precisely the same result.
Acting on the advice of Dr. Lang and others, he took his press and types, of
which he had a greater knowledge than picks and forks, to Brisbane. There, on June
20th, 1840, he issued the first number of the Moreton Bay Courier, which was carried
on with success until the end of 1859, when it changed its proprietorship and became
the property of the late Hon. T. B. Stephens, who altered its name, christening it the
Brisbane Courier. Mr. Swan claims to be one of the oldest, if not the oldest, pressman
in the Australian Colonies. In the early years of the existence of the Moreton Bay
Courier, much opposition was experienced to the views advocated in its columns.
Mankind, as a body, is generally adverse to a change from the existing order of things,
and meets with denunciation and derisive criticism opinions which express the
necessity for reform. Sometimes it is class interest which narrows the range of our
intellectual horizon; sometimes inability to grasp a new idea which blinds our
mental vision.
His experience differed in no way from that of other reformers, and hence,
when he held that beneficial results would follow by adopting a policy of
anti-transportation, and separation from the parent colony of New South Wales, he
found he had probed a very old wound. Both measures have since then been carried
into operation, and it is due to Mr. Swan to say that he rendered good service
by keeping the public alive to these two questions, and advocating the course which
he believed would materially improve the prosperity of the colony. Few married
couples can assume that there is a likelihood of the completion of their
jubilee year in a colony, but this is actually the case with Mr. and Mrs. Swan, who
will be exactly, in 1887, fifty years in Australia. They have twice visited Scotland,
their native land, but on each occasion for only a short time.
Mr. Swan and his wife belong to the Baptist Church, and were the first members
of that body in Queensland. He has always taken a lively interest and very active
share in public affairs, is an alderman, and for three consecutive years occupied the
Mayoral chair of the City of Brisbane. During that period he interested himself
greatly in the erection of the Victoria Bridge, a splendid specimen of engineering
skill, extending over the Brisbane River, and connecting North and South Brisbane.
This bridge was opened for public traffic by the Marquis of Normanby (then Governor
of Queensland) and the Corporation, the event being celebrated by a grand banquet,
at which much satisfaction was expressed with the success of the undertaking, and
hopes were held out of the great future lying in wait for Queensland.
In 1878, Mr. Swan was called to the Legislative Council, where he still
continues to sit. His politics, from early manhood, have been Liberal, and he is a
staunch supporter and ardent admirer of the Premier, Sir Samuel Griffith, who, he
thinks, is the most talented statesman in Australia.


ALEXANDEE JOHN SKENE, M.A., J.P.,
Ex Surveyor-General.
JJf|N connection with the public estate of a colony which is a little more than
TO of thirty-six years standing, and which has had more than four executive
and twenty-five political leaders, the gentleman whose name appears at
the head of this article deserves a prominent place. The first Surveyor-General who
was appointed by Governor Latrobe, on the separation of Port Phillip from the
colony of New South Wales, was the well-known the late Mr. Hoddle, an officer
who laid out the city of Melbourne, and who for many years previously had been the
surveyor in charge of the Port Phillip district, Mr. Hoddle’s tenure of office did
not extend to many years, he having retired in 1853 upon a pension, from which date
until his death he led so quiet a life that it is questionable whether he was much
known to the present generation. He, however, played an important part in the
early history of the colony of Victoria, when, by foresight and a marvellous
discrimination, he secured to Melbourne the wide streets and large reserves that
adorn that city to-day. On the retirement of Mr. Hoddle, Captain Clarke, R.E.,
succeeded to the appointment, and received the distinction of becoming the first
Surveyor-General who was also a responsible minister, under the title of Com-
missioner of Crown Lands. The railway system and municipal self-government
owe their birth to him, as also did the first Melbourne Industrial Exhibition. In
1857 political exigencies necessitated the retirement of Captain Clarke from office,
when Mr. G. W. Horne, the then member for Warrnambool, undertook the duties of
the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands, and shortly after Mr. C. W. Ligar was
appointed Surveyor-General, an office thereafter distinct from that of Commissioner
of Lands. It is noteworthy that the career of Captain Clarke after his departure
from Melbourne was most distinguished. After having been Director of Works to
the British Admiralty, and Governor of the Straits Settlements (Singapore, Penang,
and Malacca), he was made Colonel Sir Andrew Clarke, K.C.M.G. and C.8., and
Minister of Public Works for India. Mr. Ligar retained office from 1858 to 1869,
when he retired upon a pension, and after touring it through Europe and North
Africa settled down in Texas, where he died about February, 1881. Mr. Skene
succeeded Mr. Ligar.
Alexander John Skene is the son of the late Major Alexander Skene, an old
Peninsular officer, who, after serving through the series of long and memorable
campaigns which gave the death-blow to the ambitious projects of the first Napoleon,
was disabled at Talavera, and finished his service in the Royal Veteran Battalion,
The subject of this memoir was born in 1820, in Aberdeenshire, and was educated at


a private school; he next entered the University and King’s College, Aberdeen, as
an Exhibitioner, in 1834, and graduated there in 1838 as an M.A. Such was his
love for study that at an age when the majority of young men simply enter upon a
University career, he had obtained his degree of M.A., had studied surveying, and
had eminently qualified himself for the battle of life. His energetic disposition
urging him to put his talents to the best use, Mr. Skene determined upon emigrating
to Port Phillip, which at that time had just been settled, and which had been made
known to the reading world by the publication of Major Sir Thomas Mitchell’s
“Explorations of Australia Felix.” In the summer of 1839 he sailed from the
Clyde, and in November, after a passage of four months, he landed at Melbourne,
where he remained for some twelve months, going thence to Geelong, where he
settled down in business as an architect and surveyor.
In 1843 Mr. Skene was appointed surveyor to the District Council of Grant,
one of the municipal bodies created under the New South Wales Act. His labours
in this position were given to the public in a map of the district which in 1847
was engraved and printed in the magazine edited and printed by Mr. Ham.
His first Government appointment was bestowed upon him by the then Super-
intendent of Port Phillip, Charles Joseph Latrobe, Esq., in October, 1848, and he
became temporary Assistant-Surveyor. Prom that date till 1853 he was actively
engaged in the field. His work consisted in surveying the natural features of the
country, in tracing the course of rivers and mountain ranges, and in occasionally
laying out some country lands for sale. This life was naturally rough, and he was
often separated for months at a time from his family, and deprived of all civilized
associations. To counterbalance these deprivations and rigours, Mr. Skene had his
consolations, the chief of which was the gradual growth of the map of the colony
under his eye, and the addition, by degrees, of some material feature to it, whereby a
terra incognita became known and assumed a place. He laid out the main lines of
road from Geelong to Belfast, Geelong to Hamilton, and Geelong to Buninyong,
being occasionally twitted by brother officers as being at hard labour on the roads.
In those days, when the creeks and rivers were unbridged and the fords very few and
widely separated, the life of a bush surveyor was certainly not a very agreeable one,
especially when the difficulties of travelling were so great that on one occasion,
though only two hundred miles distant from his family, Mr. Skene was unable to
visit them for a space of over seventeen months. To his long apprenticeship to the
bush and the thorough knowledge of the country acquired by Mr. Skene the colony
is undoubtedly indebted for the reliable and minute information possessed by the
department. It used to be said of him that, before the axe of the selector had
commenced to resound in the forests of the Western District, he knew every tree
from the Werribee to the South Australian borders.
The last work performed in the field by Mr. Skene was the survey of the
township of Queenscliff in 1853. At that time immigration was at its height,
fifteen to twenty vessels entering the Heads almost every day. Often the ignorance
of the captains, or their impatience to cast anchor, led to direful results, and on two
occasions Mr. Skene’s camp became the refuge for the women and children who had
ALEXANDER JOHN SKENE, M.A., J.P.


been rescued. After passing through the grades of Assistant-Surveyor and
Surveyor on the staff, Mr. Skene, in the latter end of 1853, was instructed
to take charge of the Geelong district, in which extensive survey operations
were being carried on in order to meet the demand for land which it was
anticipated would be caused by the large influx of immigrants. During the
three following years hundreds of square miles of country were surveyed
and offered in all parts of the Western District. There was, however, very
little inclination on the part of the public to avail themselves of even the best
lands around Ballarat, Colac, Warrnambool, Casterton, and Camperdown ; and this
resulted in the pastoral tenants securing the best portions of their runs at the upset
prices. This was the foundation of those immense estates which now extend from
Geelong as far as the South Australian border. In 1854 Mr, Skene was appointed
by letters patent surveyor of the colony, and was permanently stationed in Geelong.
In 1857 he was specially selected to report upon the efficiency of the field branch of
the department. While engaged in this service he visited every survey party at
work within Victoria, inspected all the local offices, and generally examined the
capability of Victoria for agricultural settlement. This work occupied eleven months,
and the whole country, from end to end, Avas traversed by Mr. Skene on horseback.
Between 1858 and 1860 he superintended the survey of the large tracts of
country in the Western Districts, which Avere eventually thrown open for selection
under the Nicholson Land Act of 1860. Of this act and the folloAving ones Ave have
Avritten in another memoir, and especially in regard to the Land Act of 1862 —the
Duffy Act—under the pastoral occupation portion of which Mr. Skene Avas employed
in classifying the grazing capabilities of the lands hitherto held under squatting
license, such classification being intended to hold good for ten years, and to be in lieu
of the varying payments theretofore made by the pastoral licensees, Avhich depended
upon the number of stock which they returned as being depastured on their runs.
This classification was completely upset upon appeal to the arbitrators appointed by
the Government of the day, and no advance whatever was obtained upon the former
assessment paid by the squatters, although they obtained the additional security of a
ten years’ tenure under the act. In 1864 and 1865 the labour of preparing for the
introduction of the Amending Land Bill passed by Mr. Grant, then Minister of
Lands, devolved principally on Mr. Skene during the latter year. In 1863 Mr.
Skene was transferred from Geelong to Melbourne, and in 1868 he Avas appointed
Acting Surveyor-General. In 1869, upon the retirement of Mr. Ligar, he Avas
gazetted Surveyor-General, a position he filled Avith honour to himself and advantage
to the colony until Ist July, 1886, Avhen he retired.
Under the Land Act of 1869 the redetermination of rents to be paid in
respect of the future occupation for pastoral purposes Avas again undertaken by Mi.
Skene, Avith better results than on former occasions. During the operation of that
act the half-yearly reductions in pastoral rent arising out of the alienation of lands
within the squatting tenures Avere determined by him from time to time, subject to
appeal to the minister.
In 1876 the first reliable map of the entire colony of Victoria, in four sheets,
ALEXANDER JOHN SKENE, M.A, J.P.


on a scale of eight miles to one inch, was completed under Mr. Skene’s supervision,
and engraved and printed by the employes of the department. This map has proved
of great service to the various departments in the Government service. On com-
pletion of this map of Victoria Mr. Skene, feeling that it was a disgrace to the
colonists that no reliable map of the island continent which they occupy had been
produced within the colonies, undertook, as a labour of love, the compilation of such
a map, and with the cordial co-operation of the Surveyors-General of the other
colonies succeeded in completing and publishing the large map of Continental
Australia, in four sheets, on a scale of forty miles to one inch. The first edition
appeared in 1880 and the second in 1886, with information brought down to that
date, the engraving and printing being executed at the Lands Office, Melbourne,
These maps have been much admired at the several Exhibitions, and declared equal
in execution to any published in Great Britain.
On the passing of the Land Tax Act Mr. Skene specially prepared the maps
of all the estates subject to the provisions of that act, for the use of the classifiers,
and subsequently acted as one of the three Land Tax Commissioners appointed to
hear and decide appeals against the determination of the classifiers.
Under the provisions of the Mallee Act, 1883, Mr. Skene subdivided the
mallee country (12,000,000 acres) into blocks and allotments, and presided at the
selection of the allotments.
On the passing of the Land Act, 1884, Mr. Skene again classified all the
unalienated lands in the colony under the three heads of “ Pastoral,” “ Pastoral and
Agricultural,” and “Auriferous,” and prepared a scheme of subdivision into allotments
of suitable areas according to the varying capabilities of the country. A complete
set of county maps was issued, on which these allotments were shown lithographed
in colour. The preparation of these maps engaged Mr. Skene’s almost undivided
attention during nine months, and formed a fitting close to his official career, a
marked feature of which has been the publication in map form of all the condensed
information hitherto lying undigested in the records of the department.
During his thirty-eight years’ continuous service Mr. Skene refrained from
asking for a single holiday till compelled by the fiend of rheumatism to seek relief at
the sulphur springs of New Zealand.

THE EEY. GEOEGE TAIT, M.A.
GH the influence of some men is abstract, and their paths
removed from the majority, their vocations leading them to spend their
lives in such a manner as to debar them from being ranked as public
men, yet so surely as gravitation, the unseen agent, acts, so surely do they form a
most important factor in the moulding of society, in the preservation of public
honour, in teaching modesty and restraint, and in imparting a healthy tone to
public life. The little blue gentian of the Alps possesses as great a charm for those
engaged in the search of truth as do the mighty falls of Niagara, because each was
made by the same hand, and each created to serve a purpose. As it is in the
world of nature, so is it in the world of man; as it is in the natural world,
so is it in the spiritual. Each has its lesson to teach, could we but read it; each
has its beauties to display, could we but call them forth, and see them in their
essential nature. Then, if such be the case, the philosopher may watch from his
fortress the problems of life, and write vast treatises thereon; the student burn the
midnight oil in his efforts to understand some point in these treatises; the scientist
spend months in patient investigation of some natural law, and give to the world his
discovery, or the theologian pass years in the interpretation of some of those
profound utterances contained in that Book which is his guide through life, and his
companion through eternity. But are not these men useful ? Bo they not instruct %
Bo they not modify the elements of society \ Their personal characters have a
direct influence and bearing on society, and therefore they are a power in every
country which is desirous of making national progress. To the class of theologians
belong the Bev. George Tait, and his father, Bev. John Tait, one of the earliest of
the Presbyterian ministers who sacrificed brilliant prospects in the old country in
order to aid in founding the church in Australia. Bev. John Tait arrived at Sydney
in 1837, and after a faithful and dutiful attention to the interests of the church, he
received, in 1851, a call from the Free Synod of Victoria, which he accepted. The
rush of population at that time, consequent on the discovery of gold, was so
unexpected and so great that it taxed to the utmost the resources of the church to
provide ministers for the different parts of the colony. The life of the pioneers in
church work in the colony is unknown to those who have had no experience of it, the
hardships they underwent, the sacrifices they were obliged to make, the difficulties
they encountered, the toil they endured, amongst a population composed of every
nationality, bent on but one sole object—finding gold. Society was then in a most
crude state ; there was none of the comforts of the present day, unmade roads,
inferior and expensive accommodation being the rule.


Mr. Tait took an active interest and leading part in the negotiations for
and consummation of that Union by which the different Presbyterian churches
throughout the colony were formed, in 1859, into the Presbyterian Church of
Victoria, and of the General Assembly of which he was appointed clerk.
Rev. George Tait is his third son, and was born on 12th April, 1844, at
Parramatta, New South Wales. He received his early education at the old
Melbourne Academy, at that time conducted by Mr. Robert Lawson ; then he
entered the Geelong Grammar School, which had for its head master the Rev.
Canon Vance; and afterwards his education was entrusted to the care of Dr.
Morrison, of the Scotch College. From this institution he passed to the Melbourne
University, winning in his second year the Classical and English Exhibition, and
graduating in 1865.
Many of the footballers and cricketers of his day will remember the prominent
part he took in all athletic sports, as he delighted in healthy and harmless exercise,
which ensured a mens sana in corpore sano. He figured largely in football and
cricket matches, and played for the Melbourne and the celebrated Geelong Football
Club. He was one of the original founders of the East Melbourne Cricket Club, and
by his bowling and batting contributed greatly towards establishing its reputation.
Subsequently he joined the Melbourne Cricket Club, and in 1865, a year when no
intercolonial match was played, went to Sydney as one of its representatives to meet
the Albert Cricket Club. His cricketing form was so good that he was chosen as
one of the team to represent Victoria in the match against Stevenson’s English
Eleven, The cricketing and football records of those years contain many flattering
accounts of him as a player.
After taking his degree he went to Scotland, and passed through a four years’
theological course at the New College, Edinburgh. If Mr. Tait distinguished
himself in the athletic arena, he proved he could do likewise in the theological world,
for in his third year he won one of the ordinary college scholarships, tenable for two
years, and at the exit examination was second on the list, and carried off one of
the Cunningham fellowships. He was licensed as a preacher of the Gospel by
the Free Presbytery of Edinburgh in 1869, and immediately afterwards returned to
Victoria. The extent of many of the parishes in Victoria entails much travelling
and fatigue, as those who undertake the work of a clergyman well know, besides
the discomforts that must be endured, and the great dearth of congenial spirits that
is experienced, for which an educated man naturally looks. It was in one of these
enormous parishes that Mr. Tait was settled—Donald, on the Richardson—a district
fifty miles long and forty broad; in other words, his charge covered an area of 2,000
square miles. His duty called him regularly sixty miles from home, and on the
return journey he frequently drove and sometimes rode this distance in one day.
What with visiting, answering correspondence, and attending to the organization of
such a vast district, to say nothing of preparing sermons, his time must have been
fully occupied. Of all work which a clergyman finds fatiguing, perhaps the most
arduous is that of Sunday, when he has to travel from twenty to thirty miles, and to
preach three times, a task which Mr. Tait regularly performed.
THE REV. GEORGE TAIT, M.A.


In 1872 he was called by the congregation of South Yarra to succeed the
Rev. George Mackie, and laboured there with such indefatigable zeal and energy
that the congregation increased greatly in number and prosperity. The trying
conditions under which many clergymen are obliged to work, ofttimes meet with
compensation when they can point to the results of their labours with a degree of
thankful satisfaction, and a feeling that they have discharged faithfully all that has
been required of them. The position of a clergyman in a new country differs
materially from what is experienced in the old country, as they must collect a
congregation, manage (especially in the country districts) all the affairs of the church,
collect Sunday-school scholars and teachers, and give their attention to a host of
details. The large and beautiful places of worship in all the important towns, as
well as the numberless pretty little churches in the country districts of the colony,
are proof of the activity of the several ministers.
In 1874 Mr. Tait was unanimously elected to be the first principal of the
Presbyterian Ladies’ College, the founding of which had for many years occupied
the attention of the church. Prom the beginning the college has been a pronounced
success, and has contributed largely towards the advancement of literature in the
colony. If the standard of education be low, refinement and culture will assume
the same level, and it has been the object of the originators of this institution to
avert as much as possible this state of chaos. Its continued and increasing prosperity
is owing greatly to the manner in which it is conducted, and from which no deviation
has been made since its initiation. On certain lines that were laid down the college
has been consistently worked, and its success is testimony to the boldness and
wisdom with which these were devised. The principal of a new institution, which
must be looked upon as more or less of a rival to those existing, must needs give the
most accurate attention to every little detail, and requires to exercise great wisdom
and judgment. Such was the task imposed on Mr. Tait, so that it is little wonder
that in 1878, after four years’ most anxious work, he intimated to the church his
desire to be relieved of the responsibilities of the principalship. His resignation was
accepted with regret, and at the same time a high tribute of praise was paid to him
for the efficient and masterly manner in which he had discharged his duties. The
present principal, Mr, A. Harper, succeeded Mr. Tait.
In 1879 he was called to the charge at Warrnambool, which he still holds.
The congregation has increased greatly, and the Presbyterian Church generally
throughout the district has been considerably strengthened. A commodious babbath-
school has been built, and the church, as well as the manse, has been enlarged. That
more than one new charge has been formed in the district, chiefly through Mr. Tait s
influence, is proof of his untiring efforts to extend the bounds of the Presbyteiian
Church, and to draw into her fold those who through many circumstances have not
had sufficient attention paid to their spiritual wants. It is not only in the work
assigned to him amongst his own congregation, and throughout his own district, that
Mr. Tait’s ministerial power is felt, but his position in church courts, which deseives
a passing notice, is also of considerable importance, as he is convener of the General
Assembly’s Business Committee.
THE HEY. GEORGE TAIT, M.A.


The Strong and Dods cases are now matters of contemporary history, and the
troubles arising therefrom have caused no small amount of pain and vexation of spirit
to all parties concerned. Throughout the Strong difficulty Mr. Tait consistently
acted with those in the church who hold that right of private judgment should
be granted to everyone under certain conditions, but that the doctrine of the
Presbyterian faith cannot be twisted about so as to make it bend to a preconceived
notion of what it ought to be. When difficulties in matters of faith are of a
conscientious nature, and are frankly expressed, large liberty ought to and must
be allowed, but vague and undefined liberty, which is only another name for license,
could not be countenanced, inasmuch as, if such were the case (every man
believing in the secret of his own soul just so much or so little of the creed of the
church as he pleases), there would in a short time be such a variety of opinions
and sentiments that the very idea of what constitutes a church would be lost.
Several of the most important resolutions in these two cases have been moved in the
General Assembly by Mr. Tait, and his speeches have greatly contributed to their
adoption by large majorities.
Public questions, in which he takes an active interest, also receive a great
deal of his attention. That much-vexed question of the Bible in State schools has
been warmly advocated by Mr, Tait in the pulpit, on the platform, and through the
press. The League supporting these views originated in Warrnambool, and public
opinion in that town, which has declared itself emphatically in favour of its policy,
is chiefly owing to Mr. Tait’s attitude, and it may be mentioned that the Warrnambool
branch has done its work more thoroughly and successfully than any other.
The interests of the town of Warrnambool also receive a great share of Mr,
Tait’s attention, and the half-holiday movement, which has been brought to a
successful issue, is in great part due to him, as he thoroughly recognizes the necessity
and importance of recreation. The reader can judge for himself from the foregoing
account as to the amount of labour Mr. Tait has at such an early age undergone, the
responsible positions he has occupied, the good he has effected, and the estimation he
is held in by the public, who are always prepared to acknowledge true worth.

JOHN H A MONT 1)0 W.
men are born f° feme, some have it thrust upon them, while others
Sfaill win their way by perseverance, energy and indomitable will. To the
latter class belongs the Hon. J. L. Dow. The stranger who visits
Australia is impressed with two facts —the abnormal growth and development of the
cities, and the vast tracts of fertile land devoted only to sheep walks. The statesman
clearly perceives that the weak joint in the future development and prosperity of the
country is the limited number of the tillers of the soil, who have made for themselves
homes on the vast plains of this island continent. To remedy this defect, the
thoughtful and the wise are labouring with unremitting zeal. Agriculture must be
the foundation stone, around which will cluster, in due proportion, the arts,
sciences, and manufacturing industries. Without it, the day of disaster must
inevitably come; with it, the future is full of promise. In these memoirs we have
sketched the lives of many Representative Men, yet we venture the prediction that in
no other case have we been called upon to consider the life-work of a man of greater
importance to the country than that of the Hon. J. L. Dow.
Mr. Dow was born in the town of Kilmarnock, county of Ayrshire, Scotland,
on December Bth, 1837, his father being David Hill Dow, Esq., who emigrated to
Victoria with his family, landing at Geelong in the year 1848, and engaging
in agricultural and pastoral pursuits. For a considerable period Mr. Dow,
senior, was a member of the Barrabool Shire Council. Mr. Dow was brought
up to his father’s business of farming and stock-raising. After the publication
of “ Landsborough’s Journal,” in 1861, describing the fertility of the pastoral
country in Northern Queensland, he proceeded to the Gulf of Carpentaria to
take up country for pastoral purposes, suffering the hardships and losses shared by
the other pioneer explorers during the depressed wool period between 1862 and 1866.
A younger brother, who was a partner in the venture, succumbed to the evil effects
of the climate, and Mr. Dow, finding his own health seriously impaired, returned to
Victoria, where he regained his usual vigour. In 1869 he married Marion Jane,
second daughter of the late William A. Orr, Esq., of Toorak, their family
consisting of eight children, three sons and five daughters. In 1873 Mr. Dow
joined the Age staff, as agricultural editor of the Leader. Mr. Dow’s special work in
connection with writing articles in the Age and Leader upon agriculture, land and
Land Act administration, took him at this time in frequent tours throughout Victoria
and the adjoining colonies. In 1876 Mr. Dow turned the special knowledge he had
thus acquired to account in the composition of a popular lecture on the land question,


CCs|

l«9®i
illustrated by a gigantic sketch map of Victoria, so arranged as to bring out in
distinctive colours the peculiar features of the land history of the colony. This
lecture, Mr. Dow, while travelling in connection with his press work, took occasion
during 1876 to deliver in every important centre of population in the colony, and
was instrumental, between it and his writings, in rousing the country to the
necessity for a land tax. In 1877 he entered Parliament as the representative for
Kara Kara, and, in that year, such was the pressure of public opinion, that the
Government of the day had to introduce a land tax measure, which Mr. Dow, as a
new member of that Parliament, assisted to formulate and pass into law. Mr. Dow
retained his hold upon Kara Kara, continuing to be re-elected, and on two occasions
having the compliment paid him of a walk-over.
In 1883 the proprietors of the Age and Leader sent him upon a tour through
the United States as a special correspondent, to write a series of letters descriptive
of the agricultural, pastoral, and general developments of that great country. This
series of letters, after appearing in the press, were re-published in a volume entitled
“ The Australian in America.” In 1885, Mr. Dow, as a member of the Victorian
Irrigation Commission, was again selected by the Messrs. Syme to accompany
its President, the Hon. Alfred Deakin, to America, when that gentleman
collected and put into such admirable form his exhaustive report upon American
irrigation, which exercised an important influence upon the Deakin Irrigation
Bill afterwards passed into law. This tour was described by Mr. Dow
in the Age and Leader by a second series of letters. At the close of
this second American trip, Mr. Dow resigned his press connection in order
to accept the responsibilities of office as Minister of Lands and Agriculture, in the
Coalition Government formed under the leadership of Messrs. Gillies and Deakin,
after the General Election of February, 1886. As an administrator he has
demonstrated conclusively his especial fitness for the position which he occupies,
and, as a man still in the prime of life, it is safe to predict that a continued
honourable and useful career is before him, which must prove highly beneficial to
the colony of Victoria.

THOMAS BEAMONT ABBOTT.
9! advancement of a colony is entirely due to the energy and enterprise
of those who engage in the various pursuits that contribute to develop
the resources of the country. We are, therefore, compelled to recognise
the worth of those who enter upon the various duties inseparable from business, and
carry them to a successful issue. Were it not for the shrewdness and attention of
those, who, notwithstanding the strong inducements held out to remain in the
metropolis of a country, boldly embark in business in some of the inland towns, the
development of its resources would be remarkably slow. Moreover, did they not
evince a great interest in the prosperity of the towns in which they reside, these
towns as factors in assisting to increase the prosperity of the country would cease to
exert any influence. In connection with the discussion of this subject, we may
mention the name of Mr. T. B. Abbott, one of those persevering business men, who
have materially aided to make Victoria what it is. In the various positions he has
held in the colony, he has always displayed a deep public interest, and he must
therefore be justly regarded as a Representative Man, and as an important factor in
contributing not only to the prosperity of the town of Sale, but also to that of
Victoria at large.
Mr. Abbott’s father, owing to the death of that gentleman’s parents, was
brought up by an uncle, a most influential navy agent in London, who sent him to
sea as a “middy” on board an East Indiaman, which, in those days, was similar to
a warship. Taking an aversion to the sea, he prevailed upon his uncle to send him
out to Van Diemen’s Land, which he used to hear the crew describe in the most
glowing terms. Lieutenant-Governor Sorrell, who had been a schoolmate of his
uncle’s, took him under his patronage, and secured for him a Government
appointment, many of which he held from the date of his arrival in Tasmania, in
1821, until the time of his death in 1851. He married Harriet A. Lempriere,
sister of Deputy Commissary-General Lempriere, and sister to the wives of
Surveyor-General Evans, of Tasmania, and Lieutenant-Colonel Earle, of the East
India army. The Lemprieres claim descent from the famous Rollo, Duke of
Normandy.
The subject of this memoir was born at Hobart in the year 1833, and at the
age of fourteen was, with the intention of studying afterwards for the medical
profession, apprenticed to Mr. De la Hunt, the principal chemist in that town, to whom
he gave so much satisfaction that he proposed to leave him in charge of the business
during his absence in England, or to sell to Mr. Abbott on exceedingly favourable


terms, both of which offers he declined, as he disliked the occupation. On the
completion of his apprenticeship in 1852 he went to the Ballarat goldfields, and worked
there and at Creswick with moderate success for nine months, when he returned to
Hobart, and held situations in merchants’ and auctioneers’ offices until he joined the
Bank of Australasia. Receiving the offer of a more lucrative appointment in the
Bank of Victoria, he entered this institution in 1857, and after two years’ service,
accepted the accountantship of the National Bank of Australasia at Ballarat, from
which he was removed in a few months to a similar position at Geelong. In
1860, he married Elizabeth Francis Hope, daughter of the Rev. William Johnstone
Hope, M.A., a scion of the Earls of Hopetoun. This divine was a schoolfellow of
the great mystic, the Rev. Edward Irving, and also of the great historian and
essayist, Thomas Carlyle, who, on hearing of his death, wrote to his brother the
following interesting lines:—“ Poor William! I remember him well out of my earliest
days as one of Adam Hope’s best scholars, and still hear the very sound of his voice
as he did his Euclid there. To me he was always very kind and good—a good,
noble-hearted, faithful man and worker in this world, and now he is called out of it,
he and his, in this strange and remarkable way. Let us piously say with you —‘ His
will be done.’ Adieu. Yours always most truly, Thomas Carlyle.” In 1863, Mr.
Abbott left the bank and purchased the lease of Flinders Island, situated in Bass’s
Straits, containing about half a million of acres. Not having sufficient means to
stock the Island, he took a gentleman into partnership, but, as the arrangement
proved unsatisfactory, he sold out to him, after haying resided on the island for one
year. He then went to the Crooked River Goldfields, and carried on the business of
auctioneer, commission agent, mining broker, mining manager, &c., &c., and for
some time acted as Clerk of Petty Sessions.
Although successful in some mining speculations, he lost in others, and,
consequently, finding the money he had taken with him was spent, he was compelled
to leave. With the assistance of friends he commenced business as chemist in Sale,
and from that time he has been pretty successful. When Mr. Abbott came to Sale
there were three chemist-shops in the town, but, with energy and much perseverance,
the opposition has been reduced to one. Believing in the future prosperity of Sale,
he, after some years, purchased extensive premises, and fitted up what was then
considered the largest and finest chemist-shop in Victoria. He opened a branch
establishment at Maffra, where he succeeded in wresting the trade out of the hands of
two opposition shops in that town.
Mr. Abbott has been agent for the Victoria Insurance Companies for many
years. He was also one of the promoters of the Lakes Navigation Company, has been
from its initiation Chairman of the Board of Directors, and has had the satisfaction
of seeing that company rise from a small beginning with one steamboat to a most
successful enterprise, there being now four steamboats engaged in the trade. He has
been three times elected President of the Sale Commercial Association, which has
been so instrumental in obtaining several important works for the town, notably the
canal. This association also took a prominent part in the movement for a railway

from Sale to Port Albeit, and from Stratford and Briagolong, surveys of which,
having been promised by the Minister of Kailways, there is good reason to believe
they will be constructed. He is also one of the trustees of the Sale Savings Bank
from its inception, and one of the trustees of the Australian Natives Association.
About 1880, Mr. Abbott, finding his health failing through too close an attention to
business, purchased land and built a cottage at Glencoe, six miles from Sale, where
he went to reside. There he commenced farming on a small scale, and still carried
on the chemist’s business in Sale and Maffra, but finding a small piece of pasture land
to be of no service, he has purchased and selected, for himself and his family, 4,000
acres, a small quantity of which he cultivates, the remainder being devoted to grazing
sheep and horses. Mr. Abbott has frequently been urged to take a seat in Sale
Borough and Eosedale Shire Councils, but in only two instances has he contested
elections—that for the Eosedale Shire Council—and, although he avoided asking the
support of a single elector, not being desirous of the office, yet he lost the election by
only a few votes, notwithstanding that he was opposing Eosedale men and respected
old councillors.


THOMAS KING, J.P.
oiS fN a former biographical sketch we pointed out the necessity of regarding the
S'!! 1| numerous seaboard and inland towns of the colony of Victoria as exerting
an important influence on the development of our resources. In short,
they are colonies within a colony. Their respective populations may not exceed a
thousand souls, and yet it is matter of surprise that so much enterprise and industry
is visible among the inhabitants. If there is not the same amount of competition
against which to contend as is experienced in the Metropolis, there are the difficulties
inseparable from the formation and establishment of a successful business in a town
removed from the centre of commerce. The subject of this biography is one of those
old colonists who have identified themselves most closely with the progress of the
prosperous towns of the colony. Mr. King was born at Lyston, Leicestershire,
England, on the 15th of August, 1827. He followed in his youth the occupation of
his father, which was that of a gardener. Accompanied by his wife, he arrived in
Victoria on November 10th, 1852, and went in the following February to
Warrnambool, which, at that time, consisted of about thirty huts and houses, with no
streets laid out, and only a small portion of the older parts of the town surveyed. He
was first employed by Mr. George Bostock, subsequently Manifold and Bostock,
where he remained about two years. After this he undertook several contracts under
the Road Board, and, subsequently, traded to the Ararat and Great Western diggings,
which were then in a very prosperous state. It was during one of these journeys
that he was attacked by bushrangers, two of whom from behind trees presented
revolvers at him and called upon him to “ stand.” Being provided with a long whip,
he struck them both across the face, and thereby caused them to miss their aim. A
friend who was only a few yards behind, having a double-barrelled gun, shot one
of the ruffians in the neck, from the effects of which—although he with his
companion could seek safety in flight—he died on the following day in a hut not far
from the scene of the occurrence.
Shortly afterwards Mr. King began business as a general carrier and forwarding
agent, and, in 1864, he, in addition, embarked in hay, corn and general produce
dealing, which he carried on for fifteen years very successfully. Two years prior to
selling this business, he had the misfortune of having his place burned down, which
was uninsured, and several years after this catastrophe, his produce store in another
part of the town met with a similar fate, and was also uninsured, owing to some
preliminaries with an insurance company not having been completed. His shipping
business at this time was extensive, and the loss of his books, stock, and store was a


great drawback, but being of a hopeful and enterprising temperament, he was urged
to more vigorous efforts, and increased his business, especially with the other
colonies. In local politics, Mr. King, for many years, took a very prominent part,
and in 1866, on the receipt of a numerously signed requisition, he became a candidate
and was elected a member of the Borough Council, no man having since that time
taken a warmer interest in the welfare of the rising town of Warrnambool than he.
To Mr. King is mainly due the credit of securing the site of the present market-place,
which was a free grant to the town. He was also very instrumental in procuring the
numerous splendid recreation grounds with which Warrnambool is so highly favoured.
Among these must be mentioned the Albert Park, a magnificent piece of splendid
scenery and fertile land, suitable for any amount of ornamental planting, with an
area of 146 acres, and the Victoria Park of 48 acres in the western part of the town.
With respect to the former it should be mentioned that, while other members of the
Borough Council were asking the Government for only 20 acres, it was on Mr. King’s
resolution that the application was altered from 20 to 146 acres, and the result is
that Warrnambool has now one of the most beautifully situated parks in the colony.
Recently Mr. King initiated a movement for securing 20 acres of land on the
beautiful River Hopkins, which has a large river frontage, and although the private
property of the Hon. W. J. Clarke, yet it had been extensively used by the
townspeople as a summer resort for picnics and fishing excursions. These grounds
were opened on June 21, 1887, and named Jubilee Park. Mr. King has also been
trustee for this land, and a member of the committee of the Warrnambool Hospital
and Benevolent Asylum from its commencement.
He, with others, was instrumental in procuring the Friendly Societies’ Park, a
beautifully situated piece of ground, twelve acres in extent, adjoining the Victoria
Park. He is also a trustee for the Friendly Societies’ Parks. He was one of the
principal movers in securing for the Temperance Society that valuable corner, a full
half-acre in the centre of the town, and is also a trustee for the same. Of the
public institutions of the town, there are few of which he has not been either
the originator, or one of the earliest active supporters. He has been chairman
of the Building Society for years, and was the first chairman of the Warrnambool
Gas Company, which has since then become corporation property. He has been a
prominent member of the committee of the Mechanics’ Institute, and for a considerable
period has acted as one of the Directors of the Western Steam Navigation Company,
and chairman of the Apollo Bay Coal Mining Company, as well as a trustee for the
Warrnambool Cemetery from its commencement. He has filled the office of Mayor
five times, and was elected for the first time on November 17, 1874. Having a good
knowledge of municipal law, with special ability, and long experience of corporation
matters, his frequent calls to the office of Mayor are easily accounted for. He has
served as a councillor lor over twenty years.
During Mr. King’s mayoralty, His Excellency Sir George Bowen, the
Governor of the colony, paid two visits to Warrnambool, and he accompanied His
Excellency to Portland on the occasion of turning the first sod of the Portland

railway. The Borough council had for many years been agitating without effect for
more suitable harbor facilities, but it was not until Mr. King, whose business made
him too well acquainted with the defects of the Port, joined with some other electors
in inviting Sir James McCulloch to represent the town, that the agitation boie fiuit.
The result was that that gentleman’s Government acknowledged the right of the town,
and a contract was soon let for a pier and breakwater to the extent of T30,000. On
Sir James going out of office, the Berry Government stopped the work. Soon after,
Sir James having resigned, Mr. King, with some other gentlemen, invited the Hon.
J. G. Francis to become a candidate, who was elected, and after great perseverance
the town’s claims were at length recognised. In addition to the approaches, costing
T27,000, a contract for £131,000 is now in course of being carried out by Messrs.
Dobson and McKenzie. In 1876, Mr. King was made a Justice of the Peace, and
has done a large amount of work since his appointment. In March, 1884, he lost
his wife, to whom he was much attached. In February, 1885, he married a second
time, his partner being Miss Paw, daughter of Mr. Whitefield Raw, of Camberwell, by
whom he has two sons to carry his name down to posterity. Mr. King has taken a
great interest, not only in social and political matters, but has also manifested a zeal
in religious circles, considering that he has been a local preacher in the Wesleyan
connexion for upwards of thirty years.

REV. SAMUEL KELSO.
qw- iLTHOUGH the number of native-born Australians now joining the
•fjli Ministry is on the increase, it is, nevertheless, a pleasure to know that
many of the most able workers in the Vineyard are natives of some part
of the British Isles. Nor should it be otherwise, since contact with men who have
received their education under the cold grey skies ol the old country has a tendency
to act beneficially on those who have been reared in the sunny climes of Australia.
And again, the influence exerted by the latter over the former class is productive of
much good, inasmuch as it tends, in a great measure, to modify their staid opinions.
This is a matter of everyday observation, for it has occurred again and again in the
case of Bishops of the Koman and Anglican Communions and the ministers of every
denomination. It is, however, to men from the old world that the present prosperity
of the several churches is mainly owing, and which, notwithstanding the feeble and
ineffectual cries of pessimists that are occasionally raised, gives promise of a steady
increase. In the colony of Victoria the Presbyterian Church holds a prominent
position, and one of her most useful and earnest men is the Rev. S. Kelso, who is a
native of the Province of Ulster. He was born in the neighbourhood of
Stewartstown, County Tyrone, his father having removed to that part of the north of
Ireland from the vicinity of Rathfriland, County Down, shortly before his birth.
Young Kelso received his early education partly from a lady who conducted an infant
school near his father’s residence, and partly in an adjoining National School.
Having at an early age determined to study for the Christian ministry, he obtained
his first instruction in Latin, Greek, and Mathematics, from the masters of piivate
academies in Stewartstown and Sandholes, whom he still remembers well and
o-ratefully. On passing successfully what was then called the Entrance Examination,
he be "an his College course in November, 1845, the classes being at that time held
in a building adjoining the famous old Belfast Academical Institution, noted for the
number of brilliant men in the British Empire who received their secondary
education within its walls. In May, 1854, having completed, so far, Ins
undergraduate and Iheological curriculum (taking a respectable place in all the
classes, and a high one in several of them), he was licensed to preach the Gospel by
the Presbytery of Tyrone, in connection with the Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Actin" under the advice of the Irish philanthropist, the late Rev. Dr. Edgar, who
always proved to be his warm friend, he went out to the mission field in Connaught,
as it was thought that the two years he spent in that province, while a student and
tutor, would give some special fitness for Christian work among its people. In
February, 1855, he was called and ordained to the pastorate of a new and important


congregation recently formed in Clones, County Monaghan, and laboured there
until he saw its members through their initial difficulties, occupying a handsome
and commodious church, and the Regium Donum, as it was named, secured for its
future ministers.
In the autumn of 1858, he was chosen by the Board of Mission directors, for
work in Victoria, and landed by the good ship “ Royal Charter ” in Melbourne, with
wife, child and servant, on December 28, of the same year. He was most hospitably
received by the Rev. James Megaw, of Ararat, who then occupied the manse in South
Melbourne, familiarly known as “ The Cabin,” and by the Rev J. M. C. Reed, at that
time minister of the church at North Melbourne. His first sermon in Victoria was
preached in the Scots’ Church, Melbourne, and from that day till he died, the late
lamented Rev. Irving Hetherington proved Mr. Kelso’s faithful and unfailing friend.
Following the example of all the brethren who preceded him from Ireland, Mr. Kelso
joined the then Synod of Victoria —the colonial representative of the Church of
Scotland —as most closely resembling the Church in Ireland. Almost immediately
afterwards he proceeded to Portland, as the congregation there, formerly in connection
with the United Presbyterian Synod, was without a pastor. The three bodies in which
the presbyterianism of Victoria then existed were found about equally represented in
the church at Portland ; but, to the credit of that congregation, and on the day
they resolved to ask him to become their minister, its members unanimously decided
to unite, and determined to call a minister irrespective of the Synod to which he
belonged. Portland has, accordingly, the honour of being the first congregation in
Victoria to declare that the old home distinctions be dropped as inapplicable to the
colony, and that there should be but one Presbyterian church in Victoria. But so
close at hand did the union of the three Synods proclaim itself, that on Mr. Kelso’s
call to Portland being sustained by the Melbourne Presbytery of the Synod of
Victoria, he was inducted into the charge on the first Sunday in March, 1859, by the
late Ven. Dr. Cairns, when on his way to Hamilton, he himself being a member of
another Synod. The union was consummated in the following April, and as it was
considered prudent to elect its first moderators from the various bodies entering into
the union, Mr. Kelso was unanimously elected to that high honour, in November,
1803, mainly on the ground of his representing the Irish-Presbyterian Church, but
largely, also, for reasons of a personal nature. He remained in Portland till the
end of the year 1868, preaching twice each Sunday in the church there, and on
alternate Sunday afternoons at Nanawong, ten miles along the beach northwards
from Portland. During the moonlight of each month, on a suitable evening of the
week, Mr. Kelso preached at Heywood, Upper and Lower Bridgewater, and,
occasionally, inland as far as Hotspur, Digby, and Branxholme. In January, 1869,
much to the grief of his Portland congregation, Mr. Kelso was translated to his
present charge then called Pleasant Creek, a quartz mining town of much promise,
which rapidly reached the large population of 9,000 inhabitants, but when, after
years of prosperity, the reefs began to fail, the population consequently decreased, till
now the numbers barely reach 5,000,

During the early years of Mr. Kelso’s ministry in Stawell, besides the two
regular services in the Stawell edifice—a church of much beauty, both externally and
internally, opened for public worship by the Rev. Dr. Nish, of Sandhurst, in May,
1869 —he held services pretty regularly at Glenorchy, Callawadda, Green’s Reef, and
Great Western. Of late years the district being, ecclesiastically speaking, fully
occupied, Mr. Kelso gives a Sunday afternoon-service monthly to Glenorchy,
Campbell’s Bridge, and Jalluker, distant from Stawell respectively, 14, 10, and 16
miles, at all of which he has very fair congregations. All these engagements,
combined with a weekly service, bible class, and the innumerable details demanding
a pastor’s attention, make the life of the minister at Stawell a very busy, but far,
indeed, from an unhappy one. None but those engaged in the work could possibly
conceive what requires to be done, and it is our pleasant duty to state that wherever
Mr. Kelso has laboured, from his first efforts to carry religious truth to the people,
and cause it to be loved and cherished by them, up to his present busily occupied
time, he has conscientiously and sympathetically inculcated the necessity of leading
a spiritual life.

JOHN DONAGHY, M.LA
... T • 1
«B subject of this sketch is of Irish parentage, and was born at Liverpool
fjl| in 1844. He arrived in Victoria in 1854, and his father commenced
a small business at Geelong in 1855, where he established works
for the manufacture of ropes. The output originally was only half a ton per
week, but the venture prospered and grew until, at the present date, twenty-five
tons are manufactured weekly. A second factory has been built at Adelaide,
to supply the trade in South and West Australia, while extensive depots have
been opened in Melbourne and Sydney. The business is carried on under the
name of M. Donaghy and Sons, and is in a highly prosperous condition. The
utmost care being exercised in the selection of raw material, which, combined with
a life-long experience in the manufacture, has contributed, in no small degree,
towards establishing the reputation of the goods in all the Australian colonies.
Mr. Donaghy, while engrossed with the cares of an extensive business, has not
neglected his duties as a citizen. For eleven years he occupied a seat in the
Council for Geelong West, being twice chosen as Mayor. Taking a deep
interest in the moral and intellectual advancement of the citizens, he has been
selected as President of the Geelong West Free Library, the Yorick Club, the
Fire Brigade, while also discharging his duties as a Justice of the Peace. At the
General Election held in 1886, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly, as
one of the representatives for Geelong. Possessing an intimate knowledge of the
wants of the people, and an accurate estimate of the legislation which will prove
most beneficial, he attends with care to his parliamentary duties, labouring with
ardour and earnestness, not only for the benefit of his constituents, but for the
advancement of Australia. As a consistent member of the Roman Catholic Church
he is equally esteemed by his co-religionists and the l D rotestant community.
Mr. Donaghy is an active and representative citizen of Geelong, ever
mindful of its interests, and anxious to advance the material welfare of its
citizens. To such men is due the prosperity of the place, and the important fact
should not be forgotten that, with Melbourne competition so near at hand, the
business with which he is connected has been founded and conducted with
success in Geelong. IMblic sentiment, in all progressive communities, should
heartily encourage and support men of action, who, in achieving personal success,
materially improve their fellow citizens.

DR. THOMAS SCOTT.
subject of this sketch was born April 26, 1842, in Omagh, County
Tyrone, Ireland. His father was James Scott, of Lisnamalard and
Woodlands. Hr. Scott received his early education at a private school
conducted by Mr. Potterton. Developing a strong inclination to obtain a knowledge
of the “ healing art,” at the age of fifteen he became a pupil of the late Dr. Henry
Thompson, surgeon to the Tyrone Infirmary, and possessing a provincial reputation of
the highest character. Under his careful tuition Dr. Scott laid the foundation of his
subsequent success as a surgeon and general practitioner. Having passed the
classical examination at the College of Surgeons, Ireland, he attached himself to the
Richmond, Whitworth, and Harwich hospitals, where for four years he acted as
dresser and clinical clerk to the leading surgeons and physicians, amongst whom was
the eminent Dominick Corrigan. At the Carmichael School, North Brunswick-street,
Dublin, he studied anatomy, physiology, and the other subjects required by the
licensing bodies, and after a highly successful career as a student, he, in 1863,
became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, England. At the early age of
21, his health having suffered from too close application to his studies, he determined
upon a sea voyage, securing the appointment as surgeon to the ship “ Great
Australia,” bound for Melbourne, arriving in Hobson’s Bay in 1864. In a few weeks
Doctor Scott sailed for Auckland, in the American ship “Fletcher,” as surgeon in
charge of military settlers recruited by Colonel Pitt. Not liking New Zealand, he
returned to Victoria and commenced practice at Mount Prospect, where he remained
for one year. He then returned to England in the good ship “ Lincolnshire,”
spending some time in Edinburgh, and becoming a Licentiate of the college of surgeons
of that city. He married Rosa, second daughter of George McCarter, of Beechmout,
Strabane, North Ireland, by whom he has three sons and a daughter. Returning to
Victoria he was appointed resident surgeon to the Ararat hospital, where he remained
one year. He then removed to Belfast and entered upon private prrctice. Previous
to leaving Ararat, he was presented with a most flattering testimonial by the hospital
committee. After seven years of hard work in Belfast, in which he took an active
part in public affairs, being twice elected mayor, he removed to Sydney, where he
commanded an extensive practice for two years. Deprived of the cool breezes and a


(s 2 ——“a
sight of the green fields of the Western District, he became discontented with city
life, and in consequence removed to Hamilton, where for nearly eight years he
enjoyed one of the largest country practices in the colony, at times being called a
distance of 200 miles. The extent of his practice will be gathered from the fact that
he treated nearly 200 cases of hydatids, patients coming from nearly all parts of the
colony. As hon. surgeon of the Hamilton hospital he performed many critical
operations. Desirous of re-visiting Europe, he disposed of his practice, and went to
England. At the Newcastle Infirmary he remained for three months, and read with
Dr. Limont, of that city. He then paid a visit to the charitable institutions of Glasgow
and London. Not content, he proceeded to Brussels, Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, and
Paris, where he was received with the greatest courtesy by the leading scientists of
those cities. He returned to Victoria in March, and is now practising as a consulting
surgeon and physician in the beautiful town Warrnambool.

HERR ADAM FLOCK.
MEEK ADAM PLOCK was born at a village near Hessen Cassel, in
Germany, in the year 1824, and received his first musical education on the
piano and organ from his father, who was curate in the Calvinistic church
of that place. His grandfather, George, was a military man, and served under
Frederick the Great in all the battles of the Seven Years’ war, and was wounded only
once at the termination of that celebrated campaign. Herr Plock studied the violin
and clarionette and also instrumentation under Herr Eitter, and subsequently became
a pupil, on the piano, of Dr. Yolkmer. In the year 1842, he, at the early age of
fifteen, emigrated to New York, where he landed, unable to speak a word of English,
and without a friend. On the second night of his arrival in that city he was engaged
to play the second violin at the French opera. Shortly afterwards he joined a
company formed for Kingston, Jamaica, as double bass player. On the breaking up of
this company he was offered, and accepted, the position of organist at St. Ann’s, in
that island, and resigned the appointment only to come to Victoria —the land of his
adoption. Whilst residing in Jamaica, he visited Panama, Lima, and other places in
the South American continent, and on his return he married a daughter of a West
Indian merchant. Herr Plock arrived in Victoria in 1853, and shortly after landing,
accepted an engagement under Mr. John Hyde, an old shipmate, as clarionette player
at the Queen’s Theatre, Queen-street, Melbourne. He afterwards played the
double bass at that theatre, and, subsequently, the same instrument at the
Olympic, under the management of Mr. George Coppin. During the time that he
was engaged at that theatre he started business in Flinders-street, and after
continuing to play for the period of about two years, he bade a temporary adieu to
the musical profession, and entered solely into commercial pursuits. This portion of
his career was attended with but variable success, which induced him to again turn his
attention to the muse ; he therefore finally returned to the musical profession about the
year 1871. His versatile talents shortly attracted the notice of Lady Bowen, who
generously extended to him her patronage and support, and it is to her Ladyship’s
recognition of his musical ability that Herr Plock dates his real success. From that
period to the present he has secured and retained the discriminating patronage of
the wealthy classes of this musical country, who have always manifested their hearty
and generous appreciation of his ability and general desire to please. One special
feature in the success which attended his efforts to win a position amongst Victoria’s
most distinguished musicians was the introduction, at great cost, of high-class dance
music, principally of German composition. He has achieved marked distinction in this
particular department of his profession, and it is universally admitted that he has


no superior or even rival in this branch. He may fairly claim to be the pioneer of
first-class dance music in Victoria. A few years ago he established a military band
which so many have heard with delight at his moonlight concerts at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground ; he also originated the band at the Albert Park drive, which has
been the resort of the elite of Victoria, headed by the vice-regal representatives. In
addition to his efforts to promote the cultivation of good music in the ball-room,
park, and garden parties, he has at all times manifested a hearty desire to assist in
aiding charitable movements —notably in aid ot the Children’s Hospital. As a
composer, his compositions have commanded the highest price ever paid tor colonial
compositions, having attracted the notice of Messrs. Chappell and Co., of London,
Messrs. Glen & Co., of Melbourne, and other publishers. As a teacher, he has been very
successful, and he is engaged at present in conducting large classes, both at the Church
of England Grammar School and St. Francis Xavier’s College. Amongst his private
pupils he has had the honour to number some of the most distinguished ladies in the
colony. Herr Plock has during his musical career been the recipient ot many
flattering and genuine tributes to his ability, notably, on one celebrated occasion at
St. Kilda, at a ball given in honour of the officers of the Flying Squadron, when
Prince Louis of Battenburg specially complimented him on his excellent music,
and assured him that no better music could be heard in the salons of Europe.
As an illustration of the early genius and perseverance of the subject of our
notice, Herr Plock, when quite a youth and when playing in a hand at Long Island,
near Few York, had an opportunity of displaying the soundness of his musical
training. The occasion was as follows One evening, an American lady brought a
piano copy of a portion of the opera of the “ Bohemian Girl,” then only just out, to
the bandmaster, with a request that it should be played at her house the next evening.
The leader at once promised to undertake the task, but, upon reflection, was extremely
puzzled to know how it could be accomplished, as there was only one copy and that
for the piano. He glanced around the band in the hope that some one would
volunteer to score it for orchestra, but each member was silent, until Herr Plock,
only a youth, as before stated, offered to do it. “You !” said the bandmaster; “Yes,”
said he, “ and I promise you to have the full score arranged ready for rehearsal by
to-morrow at 11 o’clock.” Punctually at the time he produced the full score, which
was played, and went off successfully, much to the amazement of the hand and the
leader, who, turning round to Herr Plock said, “ Sir, you are a musician.”

JOHN ROBSON.
subject of this paper—the fourth son of the late Mr. Matthew Eobson,
mm builder, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, Northumberland—was born in that
ancient and historic town on the 12th of February, 1888. His earliest
recollections are intermingled with the towers that furnished the ancient wall of that
town, and which, until quite recently, stood near the West Gate. Thus, from his
childhood, the antique and romantic coloured his life, and now he delights in recalling
the scenes of his boyhood, the quaint old buildings, with which were associated
mysterious legends that fed his fancy and developed a taste for the artistic and
ideal which is closely identified with such natures as his. In this ancient ivy-covered
town was carried on a day school, under the superintendence of a dominie named
Halliwell, to whose tender mercies young Eobson was at first consigned. The
dominie, being well up in years, soon passed away, and John was then transferred to
the training establishment of Mr. J. P. Eobson (the Poet of the North) in St.
Nicholas’ Churchyard. Eapid improvement necessitated his removal, and he was
relegated to the care of Professor Eoss, of the Presbyterian School in Blackett
Street, where he fulfilled the early promise given of becoming a thorough student.
His bright intelligence soon singled him out for the especial attention of the professor,
who devoted more than the ordinary care in guiding his apt pupil’s study, and
frequently imparting especial instruction on divers subjects, particularly that of
practical chemistry. On leaving school, being quite a diminutive youth, whose
stature at that age rendered it improbable that he would possess the necessary
physique to enable him to become a practical builder, like his father and brothers,
he was placed in the hands of an architect; but the excitement incident to the
Californian and Australian gold discoveries having, about this time, seriously
unsettled the minds of many sober-thinking Englishmen, and Eobson pere being
smitten with the gold-fever, young Eobson was compelled to forego his studies and
accompany his family (fourteen in number) to the shores of Australia Felix.
The journey was not made haphazard, for Mr. Eobson, senior, had taken the
precaution of sending one of his sons to Australia on the first report of gold discovery,
and, on the representations of this son, it was decided to emigrate. As indicating
the peculiar ideas of Australia entertained at that day by intending emigrants, as
well as exemplifying the characteristic determination and precaution of the north
country women, it may be mentioned that Mrs. Eobson (still living with her son,
hale and hearty, though in her 84th year) refused to leave England until she became
perfectly satisfied that there would be a house (even wooden) to shelter her younger
children and herself. Eobson pere in this emergency bethought himself of a plan,


and, acting on the inspiration, constructed a four-roomed cottage in such a manner
that it could be put together or taken to pieces for transport. This curiosity excited
the attention of hundreds of the townspeople, who never seemed to weary ot
inspecting it.
From earliest childhood the subject of this biography manifested a love for
music, and on moonlight nights during the voyage little John’s piccolo was in constant
requisition by the passengers of the ship “Arabian,” which sailed from Liverpool on
the 19th August, 1854 ; and more immediately by the sailors, with whom he became a
great favourite on account ot his super-excellence in sailors hornpipes, and his
untiring complacency in acceding to the demands of the “ tars.”
Arriving in Australia in the middle of November, 1854, when the disturbances
at Ballarat were at their worst, the sight of bands of military leaving Melbourne for
the purpose of quelling the riots was not a very assuring one to the new arrivals, who
were also bound for the scene of tumult. It was not, however, until two years after
this—vi z ., in 1856—that Mr. John Eobson went to Ballarat to join his father and
brothers, who, in those early days, like all pioneer settlers, combined their trade with
digging, going through the rough and in many instances fascinating experiences, the
memories of which to this day are dear to all who passed through them. In this
connection Mr. Eobson was more or less identified with the incidents of the opening
up of the Lady Barkly and Caledonian leads, and was one of the original sinkers of the
shaft of the Great Eepublic Company, at the rear of the Ballarat Hospital.
In 1858 Mr. Eobson relinquished mining and mechanical pursuits, and accepted
an appointment temporarily as assistant teacher in St. Paul’s day school, which in
those days was under the control of the Denominational Board. Eetiring from this
position, he on the Ist of August, 1859, entered the service of the National Bank of
Australasia as a junior clerk, and steadily rose in position until in 1871 he was
appointed manager of the Ballarat branch. In December, 1875, he retired from that
institution, and in conjunction with his eldest broth er William, started theGunbower
Steam Saw Mills on the Eiver Murray, which are still in full operation under the
personal management of his brother, resident at Echuca. Continuous application to
official routine having seriously impaired his health, the trying northern climate
precluded Mr. Eobson’s identifying himself closely with the practical details of his
saw mills; he consequently remained in Ballarat, and on his recovery accepted the
management of the Australian and European Bank, which was subsequently absorbed
by the Commercial Bank of Australia. In 1885 he was appointed manager of the
Ballarat Branch of the Mercantile Bank of Australia, which position he at present
worthily fills.
From early manhood Mr. Eobson has manifested the warmest s} r mpathy and
interest in all religious, moral, and charitable movements, and this characteristic
still adorns a life which for the past twenty-five years has been devoted to the
furthering of the public welfare.
A prominent member of the Church of England of the broad school, all
denominations are to him alike, in the respect that all being parts of one “stupendous
JOHN ROBSON.


whole,” are entitled to, and have always obtained at his hands, the most cordial
sympathy and support. As a dignitary of his church, he is official principal —that is,
he is Deputy-Chancellor (legal business apart) of the Diocese of Ballarat, and of
course a member of the Diocesan Council. His loyalty to his church was well
exemplified when Bishop Thornton and family first arrived in the colony. No
residence having been prepared for the Bishop, Mr. Kobson without hesitation placed
his city establishment at the disposal of the prelate, who thankfully availed himself
of the generous offer. Mr. Robson has naturally taken a prominent part in diocesan
work, and by his untiring zeal and ability organised a scheme for the extension of
the Church Sustentation Fund, devoting himself to the work with energy. His
successful labours earned for him the special thanks of the Diocese, which were
appropriately conveyed.
In Musical circles Mr. Robson occupies the position of a distinguished amateur,
having held foremost rank for the past twenty-five years. In 1864 he was appointed
honorary conductor of the Ballarat Philharmonic Society, and from that time to the
present he has been generally accepted as the leader of all important musical
movements; as, for instance, when in 1880 the Raikes Centenary was held, he was
unanimously elected musical director of the week’s programme, which culminated in
a grand concert in the Alfred Hall, on which occasion a band and chorus of 1,500
voices responded to his baton, the result being a success of such magnificence as has not
been approached in the colony outside of the metropolis. The present leading musical
society, viz., the Ballarat Liedertafel (admittedly the most successful Ballarat has
ever seen) owes its great popularity mainly to the talent and energy of its conductor,
Mr. Robson.
In Educational matters Mr. Robson is ever industriously at work, and as a
Shakesperian scholar he is looked upon as probably the leading authority in Ballarat.
Up to the year 1870 music was considered his forte, but in that year he electrified
the citizens by giving, on behalf of a local charity, a recital of Shakespere’s tragedy
of Macbeth without book or manuscript, reciting nearly the whole piece, and giving
to each particular character his or her individual portraiture in such a masterly manner
that at once stamped him to be a man of unusual ability possessing great powers, as
observed by Bishop Moorhouse after one of Mr. Robson’s recitals in Melbourne.
Macbeth was quickly followed by Hamlet, which was by Press and public pronounced a
still greater success, and from that time his reputation in this direction has become
peculiarly his own. The public records afford ample proof of Mr. Robson’s unusual
gifts and the untiring zeal with which he has applied them for public benefit, since
there is not a town of note in Western Victoria where he has not appeared in
connection with some charitable, religious, or educational purpose.
Though frequently urged by all classes of the community to court Municipal
and Legislative honors, Mr. Robson has hitherto invariably declined to allow himself
to be nominated. The hope is still entertained, however, that eventually he may be
induced to contest a seat in Parliament. His sterling integrity and fearless
independence, combined with a keen and penetrative mind and a singularly felicitous
JOHN EOBSON.


method of expression, coupled with his experience as a public speaker, lead to the
inference that, should he yield to the solicitations ot the community, a desiiahle,
energetic, and capable representative would be secured. The artistic being so
manifest in Mr. Robson, it might be imagined that there would be (as is invariably
the case) a lack of the practical prevailing; but nothing could be further from the
fact, his general tendency being entirely in the direction of the practical, as his
abundant labors amply testify.
Mr. Robson is an eminent Freemason, having been appointed Worshipful
District Grand Junior Warden (the highest honor obtainable by a provincial Mason)
by Sir William J. Clarke, on the occasion of his own installation as Right Worshipful
District Grand Master of Victoria.
Courtesy, cheerfulness, and activity are among the most prominent traits of
Mr. Robson’s character. As a leader he is somewhat of a martinet, but in private
life he is geniality personified, and a great favorite with the young men of the city,
whose advancement he is always aiding. Identified as he has always been with the
city of Ballarat, from the time when it was a mere collection of tents, and always in
the van, particularly in all movements having for their object the amelioration of
human woe or the cultivation of a higher education, there are few individuals more
highly esteemed or more widely respected.
JOHN EOBSON.


REV. JOHN KENNEDY MACMILLAN.
clergyman whose name is at the head of this biographical memoir was
born in the Manse of Ballachulish, in the county of Inverness, in 1833.
The parish is famous for its romantic scenery, and is visited every
summer by thousands of tourists from all parts of the world. From the windows of
the Manse the mountains of Glencoe, of Ardgover, and of Morven are distinctly
visible. The parish lies along the shores of Loch Leven —an arm of the sea running
inland from Loch Linnhe—and stretches from the pass of Glencoe to the base of
Ben Nevis, the loftiest mountain in the British Isles.
The parish schools of Scotland were well-conducted institutions, and were
usually under the charge of men who had attended the Universities of the country,
and who were, therefore, competent to impart instruction, not only in the subjects of
an ordinary education, but also in Latin, Greek, and geometry. Mr. Macmillan
received his earliest education in the school of his native parish, and afterwards
attended the High School of Edinburgh. In 1846, when only thirteen years of age,
he proceeded to the University, where he took a good place in his classes, and at
seventeen received his degree. Having resolved to study for the Church, he entered
the Divinity Hall of the New College in Edinburgh in 1850, and for four years
attended the classes of divinity, Church history, exegetical theology, and Hebrew.
The course of study, preparatory to becoming a clergyman in the Scotch Church,
extends over eight years—four at the arts classes in the University, usually known as
the undergraduate course, and then the remaining four in the Divinity Hall. Having-
passed through this course of professional education, Mr. Macmillan became a
minister in 1855, when only in his twenty-second year.
After a few months, during which he visited several of the remotest parts of
the Highlands of Scotland, including the island of lona, he was selected to become
the assistant to the Kev. Dr. Thomson, of St. George’s, Paisley, and continued to hold
this appointment for nearly two years. His chief pastoral work was to visit the
non-churchgoing families in a parish of some two thousand people; and the knowledge
which he thus acquired of the habits of the sunken masses of a city population was
of great service to him in his work as a minister of religion in after years. He
succeeded in establishing a Mission Church, a Sunday School, and a Savings Bank for
the poor, in a destitute part of the town. On resigning his appointment, he received
from the congregation and from the mission gifts of money and books, “ in token of
his able, diligent, and successful services.” He had frequently been urged by the
Colonial Committee of the Church to proceed to Australia, where young clergymen
of zeal and activity were greatly needed, in consequence of the increasing population


of the colonies, but more especially of Victoria. At length, in 1858, he expressed his
willingness to accept an appointment in Victoria, which he at once received, and
sailed for Melbourne. He had as his companion on the voyage one whom he selected
before leaving Scotland, and who has been his friend and partner ever since.
On landing in Melbourne, Mr. Macmillan was cordially welcomed by Drs.
Cairns and Macdonald, by Mr, Hetherington, and many other clergymen, nearly all of
whom are now no more. He was invited to visit Beechworth, which was quite
prepared to receive a clergyman. Arriving in that town in the last week of 1858, he
was, early in 1859, inducted as the minister of the Presbyterian Church there. He
lost no time in beginning a thorough organization of the congregation, and took steps
to wipe off the building debt. By a system of regular contributions, the total debt
of upwards of <£looo was cleared within the space of four years. While thus
attending to his own congregation, he visited every part of the Ovens District, and
formed Churches at Bright, Buckland, Yackandandah, Chiltern, Oxley, Benalla,
Stanley, and other places. In due time ministers were settled over these parishes,
and the Presbytery of Beechworth was formed. Mr. Macmillan, from the services he
rendered to the Presbyterian Church throughout the Ovens District, in the building of
places of worship, in the settlement of clergymen, and in the planting of schools, may
be regarded as among the best known of the pioneer clergymen of the colony, nearly
all of whom have now passed away. Although the denominational system of education
then existed in Victoria, Mr. Macmillan took an active part in promoting the national
system, as that best fitted for a people of different religious creeds, to all of whom it
would be impossible to give satisfaction under that which then prevailed. He built
the National School at Beechworth, at a cost of £BOO, the Education Department
contributing one-half of the expense. He was corresponding member of its committee,
lectured frequently on behalf of the principles of a national system, and was examined
by the Royal Commission on Education, of which Mr. Higinbotham was chairman.
The Bill on the subject of National Education, subsequently submitted to Parliament
by Mr, Higinbotham, was withdrawn, as Mr. Macmillan believed, to the great loss
of the country. Of his services in connection with the question of education, the
newspaper at Beechworth said:—“ The reverend gentleman took a very forward and
intelligent part in the establishment of a National School in this town, the first attempt
here at a system of secular education, and his communications on the subject were
copied, commented on, and approved of by the Melbourne Press.” “ The Rev. Mr.
Macmillan fought that question with great energy and ability, and, moreover, with a
forbearance not always shown by either side, which won him the approbation of
both.” Some years afterwards, in revisiting Beechworth, the same newspaper thus
refers to him : —“ He preached in the Presbyterian Church last Sunday, and, we need
scarcely say, received a very cordial welcome from his old congregation, which must
be endeared to him by many associations. He was also warmly received by many
others outside the congregation, who had joined with him in many a good work at
the time when the men of Beechworth made it what it now is.” Mr. Macmillan took
a deep interest in the welfare of the prisoners in the gaol, who sometimes numbered
KEY. JOHN KENNEDY MACMILLAN.


one hundred. He preached for upwards of seven years, every Sunday morning, to
the Protestant portion; and on the last occasion that he conducted divine service there,
one ot the prisoners rose in his place, and, in an eloquent speech, proposed the
thanks ot all to him, who had so long sought to do them good. At the same time he
received trom the governor of the gaol and from the sheriff an official communication,
in which they thanked him for the deep interest which he had always taken in
the prisoners, and regretted that there was no substantial token to be offered in
recognition of his services.
While Mr. Macmillan so diligently attended to the institutions of Beechworth
and to the welfare of the district, he did not neglect his other duties. He preached
four times every Sunday, in his own Church and at Stanley. A Manse was built, and
the congregation prospered in every way. After two years of unceasing work at
Beechworth and in the neighbourhood, frequently involving long night journeys to
reach his home, so as to be ready for the engagements of next day, he was translated
to Hamilton. On leaving Beechworth, he received addresses, not only from his own
congregation, but also from some of the neighbouring Churches, and a purse of one
hundred sovereigns, in acknowledgment of his labours among the people. He was
inducted as clergyman of the Presbyterian Church at Hamilton in 1869, and, during
his ministry there, the edifice has been enlarged, at a cost of £ISOO, and is now free
of debt. The Manse has also been greatly improved and enlarged, at an expenditure
of <£soo, which has been paid off. The Presbyterian Church of Hamilton is regarded
as having one of the most important congregations in the Western District. Mr.
Macmillan is clerk of the Presbytery of Hamilton—a similar appointment, it will be
remembered, having been held by him while at Beechworth. He has always taken a
deep interest in the progress of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, and a leading
part in her work, not only in the Presbytery, but also in the General Assembly, of
which he was Moderator in 1878. The organ of the Church, in referring to the
manner in which the business of the Assembly was that year conducted, said that
‘ ‘ Personalities —the bane of public Assemblies—were rarely indulged in. It was evident
that there was little desire on the part of members to vex each other, but a wish to
work together for the best interests of the Church to which they belonged. A good
deal of this, it ought to be stated, was due to the admirable tact and temper of
our present Moderator.” Of the same Assembly the Southern Cross had to say :
“ Doubtless, under the tuition of the hoary heads in her ministry, of whom there is
rather a large number for so young an institution, she will develop as she grows
older a becoming degree of gravity when met in General Assembly. In this behalf,
we could almost wish that the Eev. J. K. Macmillan had been appointed Moderator
for a term of years.”
Mr. Macmillan was for sixteen years Convener of the General Assembly’s
Committee on Statistics, and frequently received its thanks for his painstaking
services in collecting and arranging the statistics of the Church. He has on several
occasions been chosen to till pro tempore the Moderator’s chair in the Assembly,
especially when difficult cases came under consideration. In the “ Dods ” case of
KEY. JOHN KENNEDY MACMILLAN.


1887 he was unanimously called to the chair as Acting Moderator, and of his
management of the business the Melbourne Press said: —“ The Assembly rose
happily to a higher level than that formerly attained by the Presbytery of Melbourne,
and that it did so was largely due to the able, impartial, and firm conduct in the
chair of the Key. J. K. Macmillan, the Acting Moderator.” He has also acted
occasionally as clerk pro tern, of the General Assembly.
In 1883, Mr. Macmillan was selected by the General Assembly to represent
the Victorian Church in the Supreme Courts of the Home Churches, and in the General
Council of Presbyterian Churches which was to meet in 1884 in Belfast, Ireland.
He attended the General Assemblies of the Scottish Churches, and was chosen
President or Chairman at one of the meetings of the Great Council in Ireland, when
he delivered an address on Victoria, and the state of religion in the colony. On
returning to Hamilton in October, 1884, a public meeting was held in the Town Hall
to give him a reception, at which the Mayor presided. The whole town was
represented. Addresses were read, and there was the presentation of a service of
plate on behalf of the public institutions, with which Mr. Macmillan had been closely
identified. In describing the meeting of welcome, the Hamilton Spectator said :
“ Members of every denomination, Catholic and Protestant, joined, and there can be
no gainsaying the fact that it was the most successful demonstration of the kind ever
seen in the district.” A special feature in the demonstration was the singing of a
hymn composed by a lady—a member of the Church. The following is the last
verse: —
“Kind faces meet thee, glad thou art come;
Glad voices greet thee, welcome thee home ;
Safe o’er the wide stormy sea thou art come,
Back to thy people, thy work, and thy home.
Gladly, gladly welcome ;
Welcome, welcome home.”
Mr. Macmillan still continues minister of the Church at Hamilton. He is
now one of the oldest of our colonial clergy, and has been in Victoria for nearly
twenty-nine years. With the exception of ten others, he has served the Presbyterian
Church of Victoria longer than any of her clergymen. He was one of the fifty-five
ministers (thirteen of whom only now remain) who formed the Presbyterian Church
of the colony, on its present basis, in 1859. He has seen the denomination grow
from a church of fifty-five ministers to one of a hundred and eighty. It now numbers
nearly three hundred distinct congregations, and has places of worship and Manses in
every part of Victoria. Mr. Macmillan has rendered good service to nearly all the
institutions of the town in which he resides, and his exertions on their behalf have
been frequently acknowledged. It is mainly, however, as a Churchman and as a zealous
minister of the Presbyterian Church, in extending and maintaining her influence for
good throughout the colony, that his name will not soon be forgotton.
REV. JOHN KENNEDY MACMILLAN.

HON. G. D. LANGRXDGE.
writing the biographies of some of the foremost men of Victoria, one
S«m £i is necessarily compelled to recall chapters of Victorian history. Identified
with the colony from its earlier days, they vividly bring to the mind’s eye
the prominent figures and the crowded incidents of the first few years of the colony’s
record. Trained, if not actually born and educated, in the colony, the careers of such
men, both private and public, have been spent in Australian institutions. They were
selected by the popular sense of the fitness of things to represent the people in the
successive grades through which a popular representative has to pass as Councillor,
Mayor, Member of Parliament, Minister of the Crown. Of such men, who have
characteristically written the history of Victoria in their own lives, is the gentleman
whose name heads this article.
Though born in England, Mr. Langridge has been associated with Victorian
institutions for upwards of a quarter of a century. In fact, it may be said that his
career is inextricably interwoven with the rise and progress of the colony, and hence
we find that, even at an early date, popular opinion pointed him out as a trustworthy
guide and counsellor, with the result that the confidence which he engendered has
been amply borne out, and that he has justified vox populi by his useful and capable
public administration. Intelligent, industrious, painstaking and strictly conscientious,
he has forced his way to the front in a straightforward and honourable manner. He
owes his advancement neither to intrigue, cabal, or time-serving, but to the able
discharge of the varied and responsible duties which have devolved upon him. So
long as it is possible to induce such men to seek the suffrages of the people, it cannot
be said that the governing or administrative power can be exhausted.
George David Langridge was horn at Tunbridge Wells, England, in 1829. His
father died one year after his birth, leaving a family of six children. At an early
age, George was apprenticed to a builder, surveyor and auctioneer, at Banbury,
in Oxfordshire, but subsequently proceeded to London, where he joined his brother,
who was engaged in the building trade in the metropolis. When news of the great
gold discoveries in Australia reached England, Mr. Langridge, with thousands
of other youths, was smitten with the gold-fever, and determined to emigrate, in
order to realise a fortune in a few days, according to the glowing descriptions which
were sown broadcast. Landing in Sydney shortly after the reported discoveries, he
crossed over to Melbourne, and thence proceeded to the goldfields. After a short
trial, finding the life of a gold digger uncongenial, he returned to Melbourne, where
his knowledge of building brought his services into requisition. Amongst the various


works in progress, the Military Barracks, on the St. Kilda Road, were in course of
construction, and the supervision of these buildings was entrusted to him. Qne
hundred men from the 40th Regiment, then stationed in Melbourne, and quite
a small army of mechanics, were placed under his orders. At the end ot two years,
Mr. Langridge resigned his position, and commenced business on his own account
as a contractor and builder. In this capacity, he completed numerous important
works, not only in the capital, but also in various parts ot the colony. In 1863, he
was requested to become a candidate for a seat in the Collingwood Town Council, and
was returned without opposition, holding office for a period of ten years. His
practical knowledge proved invaluable to that embryo city. In all public works
he was to the front with advice and assistance. During his regime, he was twice
elected Mayor of the city, and was greatly instrumental in furthering and constructing
the comprehensive system of underground drainage, the Alfred Hall, and Mechanics
Institute and Reading-room —all of no ordinary importance to the residents of
Collingwood, especially in the direction of health.
In 1874, Mr. Langridge’s popularity caused him to be requisitioned for a
nomination to a vacancy which then occurred in the representation of Collingwood
in the Legislative Assembly. The seat was contested by Messrs. Mirams and
McKean, but Mr. Langridge was elected by a large majority, and accordingly took
his seat as a member of Parliament that year. It was at this time that the remarkable
“ stonewalling” already referred to in other memoirs took place, and in the warm and
lengthy debates that ensued he took a prominent part, as also in opposing the
initiation of the measures which, during the McCulloch Government, were known as
“the iron hand.” He was appointed Chairman of the Commission in the matter of
the Friendly Societies’ Act; and on the report of that Commission being laid before
Parliament, he brought in and carried the Amending Friendly Societies’ Bill, which
enabled the Societies to be placed on a firmer basis, and which generally benefited
them. The next prominent matter which afforded him an opportunity of justifying
the confidence of his constituents was the calling into existence the Board, called the
Melbourne Water Supply Board, which was brought about by the carrying away of a
bridge over the River Plenty at Morang, and which calamity deprived Melbourne of
water for a period of three days. On his appointment to this board as a member, a
position he retains to the present, he actively engaged in discussing the inadequacy of the
supply for Melbourne, and zealously advocated the Wallaby and Silver Creek schemes,
until such time as the consummation of the Watts River scheme will have
permanently settled the question of an unfailing supply for the fast increasing
population of the daily growing city of Melbourne. In 1880, on the formation of the
Berry Ministry, Mr. Langridge, who had been a consistent Liberal, and had accorded
all beneficial measures his warm support, was offered the portfolio of Minister of
Public Works, and accepted that office, being re-introduced to the Legislative
Assembly on the 81st August, 1880, after acceptation of the office mentioned and
the Acting Postmaster-Generalship. One of the first duties that Mr. Langridge had
to perform on assuming the reins of the Public Works Department was that of dealing
HON. G. D. LANGRIDGE.


with the question of the unemployed who besieged the office, and fully three months
elapsed ere the difficulty was satisfactorily overcome. The letting of the tender for
the erection of the new Parliamentary Buildings was his next public act; and it will
still be fresh in the minds of many, no doubt, that this act of his occasioned much
conti oversy, owing to his having decided in favour of the west front being built with
Stawell stone. So unshakeable was his opinion in regard to the beauty and
desirability of this particular description of stone, that he had no hesitation, whilst
Minister of Public Works, in sanctioning the construction of a tramway from Stawell
to the quarries, a distance of some twenty-two miles. On leaving office, the
desirability of the carrying out of the contract in connection with the Parliamentary
Buildings was mooted, and the debate assumed so serious a phase that work was
stopped, pending the report of a Select Committee appointed to thoroughly sift the
matter. Of this Committee Mr. Langridge was one. Both the Age and the Argus
condemned the stone as being defective, on account of the occurrence of bands of stone
in some blocks of a more open texture than the main mass. On the natural surfaces
these imperfections gave the rock a spotted, rough, and laminated appearance, but in
freshly-wrought stone these imperfections could only be detected with some difficulty.
It was also urged that in the polished or rubbed blocks these spots would' show in
time, owing to the difference of absorptive power of the two kinds of material. In
considering the question, the Select Committee recommended the quarry should be
properly opened, which was done, and the result is known, and Mr. Langridge’s
opinion of the stone confirmed.
On the report of the Select Committee, the Government of 1883 dealt with the
contract again, and Mr. Langridge, being once more in the Ministry, had the
satisfaction of seeing his colleagues ratify the old contract. It has now come to be
acknowledged, on all hands, that the beauty of the stone in question is not to
be surpassed; and its suitability for all important building purposes is further
maintained, by its being now used in all the principal buildings in Melbourne.
Whilst acting as Postmaster-General, Mr. Langridge, with a view to
economising, conceived the idea of letting the Post Office Service for a period of three
years in separate tenders, instead of combined. The putting of his theory into
practice brought a number of smaller contractors into the field, and, by opening up
a competition, effected a saving of £24,000 per annum, or a total of £72,000 on
the contract.
On the formation of the Coalition Ministry, Mr. Langridge joined the
Government as Commissioner of Customs. During his term of office, the Customs
Department, which is generally a source of trouble to the chief, was administered
in such a manner that he gained not only the good-will of the officers of that
department, but the confidence and esteem of the mercantile community of all
classes. During this period, Mr. Langridge prepared a Merchant Shipping Bill, with
480 clauses. This measure, notwithstanding its liberality of constitution, would have
passed into law had not the Ministry resigned soon after, and no opportunity been
furnished of its being again brought forward.
HON. G. D. LANGRIDGE.

The continuous strain on Mr. Langridge impaired his health, and rendered a
trip to England necessary. In 1885, he left Melbourne, travelling on the Continent,
visiting England and other places. He returned to Melbourne in March, 1887,
having even, when on this trip, had the welfare of his constituents at heart. The
esteem in which he is held might be gauged from the following eloping from one of
the Melbourne daily papers :
“ Wouldn’t have missed it for anything ” must have been the verdict of every hearer in the
thronged audience at the Collingwood City Hall on Thursday night, when Mr. Langridge expatiated on
his travels, with a desperate effort to squeeze into a couple of hours the matter with which he was
bursting from every pore, enough for twenty lectures. The assemblage was Collingwood all over: a mass
of the population, men and women, swarmed together without the slightest distinction of rank or class.
This is what one likes to see, after gatherings which are painfully high-toned. The working men and
women displayed just as keen a desire to learn from Mr. Langridge about Old England, or rather New
England, as the better-off people did. We may say New England, for, as another speaker said after the
lecture, its moral was to show us that however fast we race ahead, England still leads the way in every
kind of reform and improvement. A significance of the democratic spirit of the district is the fact that
the Collingwood Town Hall has been built in the poorest quarter, on the Flat. It defiantly challenges
the Melbourne Town Hall, and the feeling of pride which led the councillors to inscribe their names in
gilt letters at the front door is excusable. Nor is there any high sounding name emblazoned on the
memorial stone, simply that of the Mayor. One could not help being struck with the immense
popularity of Mr. Langridge in Collingwood. The whole mass of the people appear to look upon him as
a piece of property all their own. His bonhomie, as the word goes, is irresistible ; his broad geniality
takes everyone into his confidence. He seemed to buttonhole the huge audience and say, “ Just stop a
moment, and listen to this.” Whether he was at Paris, Glasgow, Bristol or Derby, he took you right
into the place. G. D. Langridge, from Melbourne, was there, and you with him. Purely from an
educational point of view the value of the lecture was incalculable, and it sent away two thousand people
of all classes primed with any amount of matter for thought and conversation. Perhaps the majority of
the audience were labouring men.
HON. G. D. LANGRIDGE.


REV. ADAM CAIRNS, D.D.
the almost pre-historic days of Victoria, amongst the foremost on the roll
MS H of progress and in the lists of public life were the names of public-spirited
ministers of religion, whose very profession gave them a standing and a
position which, with the growth of the colony and the development of its resources,
have come gradually to devolve on members of the other learned professions. But
in the days when the learned professions were practically represented by clergymen,
which body alone stood between the people and the civil and military officialdom,
which was harshly forcing a rude growth, it would be impossible to estimate rightly
the influence that it exerted in shaping the history and tempering its rudeness.
In turning back to the records of those days, the names of many a divine
will be tenderly recollected, and amongst them none more so than that of the
Rev. Adam Cairns.
He was born at the manse of Longforgan, on the 30th January, 1802. Of that
parish his father, the Rev. Adam Cairns, was minister for many years. A little over
five miles from Dundee, the church and manse of Longforgan occupy a most
beautiful and commanding position. To the westward lies the rich and lovely
Carse of Gowrie, embracing a district perhaps the fairest and the richest in Scotland.
Two rocks, known as the Gows of Gowrie, and to have at one time stood out visible
in the water, are now more on land than in the water, almost concealed by a
luxuriance of sedge, fulfilling the saying attributed to Thomas the Rhymer
When the Gows of Gowrie come to land,
The day of judgment’s near at hand.
Dr. Cairns was descended from a long line of ministers, and he undoubtedly
inherited a strong taste for questions theological. In his native parish he received
his rudimentary education, but entered the University of St. Andrew’s before he was
fourteen years of age, where his more than average natural gifts, combined with
indomitable perseverance, enabled him not only to hold his own against his seniors,
but to distinguish himself in the University, and also in the Theological Hall. He
was licensed as a preacher October sth, 1824. Cast on his own resources, he was
compelled to support himself by private teaching, while in a state ot great nervous
and physical exhaustion. His only comfort was the Bible and secret wrestling with
God in prayer. His own words were: “ I can never forget the ministers whose
words were sweet to my taste, and acted as a healing ointment on my truly stricken
spirits. They were the Lord’s messengers to me, but they were neither famous for
their pulpit oratory, nor burning and shining lights in popular estimation. Preachers


they were of humble standing and of no intellectual pretensions, but full of the
Holy Ghost, rich in the knowledge of the will of God and in all wisdom and
spiritual understanding.”
After serving for a time as assistant to the late Rev. Sir Henry Moncrieff,
minister of the parish of St. Cuthbert’s, Edinburgh, the subject of this sketch was
presented to the parish of Manor, in the County of Peebles, where he was ordained
August 21st, 1828. The parish was a quiet pastoral valley; the inhabitants were
full of the spirit of kindness for their young pastor, who for four years and a-half
laboured among them with many tokens of good, and many seals of his ministry.
His health became seriously affected, the complaint being aggravated by the death of
a brother who returned from America to breathe his last at the manse. At the time
when a change was most desirable, he received a presentation to the parish of
Hunbog, in the north-west of Fife. He was inducted into that charge on the 7th of
April, 1833. It was here, on the 11th of February, 1834, that Mr. Cairns was united
in marriage to Miss Jessie Ballingall, a lady gifted in no ordinary degree with
Christian prudence and kindness. She is still spared to mourn his loss. Of a family
of six, three are deceased, and three married daughters still surviving. After a
successful ministry in his second charge, Mr. Cairns was translated to Cupar-Fife
on the 3rd of September, 1837. He entered upon the collegiate work in his new
sphere with great zeal, but his strength proved unequal to the task, and for months
his life hung trembling in the balance. The Disruption was fast approaching ; and
although in shattered health, he threw himself into the very thick of the controversy,
at once identifying himself with the Evangelical party. An esteemed minister of
another denomination then said of Mr. Cairns :
He soon awakened a strong and extensive sympathy in the congregation and neighbourhood ;
yet I believe his main attraction lay in the earnest and effective way in which he expounded and applied
the truths of the glorious Gospel. His expectations of Oupar (as regards the Disruption) were very low,
but he could not but be amazed at the number and weight of his following. He left almost the largest
and most prosperous congregation in Fife, and it continues to be so to the present day.
In November, 1847, during the afternoon service, with the speed of a lightning
flash, he was struck down in the pulpit. He was carried to the vestry, and there laid
as a dying man. Contrary to expectation, he soon recovered. Proceeding to
Gibraltar, in the hope that the climate would renovate his shattered system, and
feeling greatly benefited from the change, he hired a hall in the principal street,
where he preached to crowded audiences. The work thus begun at Gibraltar has
been continued by the Free Church ever since as a regular station of the Colonial
Mission. At this period he contributed extensively to the current literature of the
day, and an interesting volume from his pen, entitled “ The Second Woe,”
determined the Senatus of St. Andrew’s University to confer upon him the
well-merited distinction of Doctor of Divinity. The most interesting point in the
era of Dr. Cairns’ ministry was at hand. In consequence of the discovery of gold
in Australia, the Free Church was impressed with the urgent necessity of providing
the means of grace for the thousands who were flocking to this great island beneath
REV. ADAM CAIRNS, D.D.


the Southern Cross. Ten young men were selected, but as they were without
experience, it was deemed prudent to have them accompanied by at least two
members of standing and experience. The Rev. Dr. Mackintosh Mackay, of Dunoon,
and the Rev. Dr. Cairns, of Cupar, were selected, and expressed their willingness to
go. On the 13th of April, 1858, a meeting was held in Free St. Luke’s Church,
Edinburgh, to implore the blessing of God on the mission; all the members were
present, with the exception of Dr. Mackay. The proceedings were conducted by the
Rev. Dr. Gordon, Rev. Dr. McKellar, the Rev. Dr. John Bonar, and the Rev. Dr.
Cunningham. The General Assembly was at hand, and before sailing Dr. Cairns
had an opportunity of speaking. In the address which he delivered, the following
passage occurs: —
Painful as it is to bid farewell to relations and friends, it is exquisitely painful to break asunder
the many ties of affection which bind me to my people. It is with peculiar pain that I take leave, as I
must do, of the Free Church—the Church of my birth, my affections, and my hopes—the Church of my
country and my God. I go, sir, trusting in the promise, “I shall give thee the heathen for thine
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.” I shall work in the distant
vineyard depending on the presence and support of the Great Head of the Church, waiting and listening
for the cry, sweeter from the lips of redeemed men than when uttered by the highest seraphim aiound
the Throne, “ Glory to God in the highest; on earth, peace and good-will to men.”
The twelve ministers all arrived safely in Australia. The sphere assigned to
Dr. Cairns was Melbourne. On his arrival he found the city in a state of transition,
emerging from a small town into the wonderful development of a great city. At that
time the Free Church consisted of two congregations in Melbourne, one of which
possessed a church, the other worshipping in a rented hall. He at once entered upon
his labours, preaching in the Temperance Hall in the morning, and in Knox’s Church
in the evening. One of the largest congregations in the southern hcmispheie
immediately sprang into existence. With pulpit qualifications of a high order, a
graceful personal appearance, an attractive manner, he not only commanded the
attention of his audience, but it was felt from the first that he was to wield an
immense influence in the colony. Upon a valuable piece of ground on the Eastern
Hill, granted by the Government, a large wooden building was hastily run up, which
served as a church for two or three years, till the present substantial building was
erected. An iron cottage was also put up on the same ground, which was
ultimately vacated for a comfortable manse. Here Dr. Cairns ministered to a large
and attached congregation for more than twenty years.
He was always foremost not only in everything that could advance the interest
and welfare of the Church of which he was a member, but also in every charitable
work that was brought under his notice. He was appointed by the Synod to be the
convener of the committee on the union with the other branches of the Church, and
this office entailed much labour and anxiety until the union was consummated in
1859. He had also been convener of the Scotch College Committee, and had been
instrumental in the promotion of the Sabbath Observance Society. He was also
convener of the Education Committee, a position which involved great responsibility
and trouble; and also convener of the Theological Hall Committee until 1804, when
REY. ADAM CAIRNS, D.D.


ill health compelled him to retire from the position; and further, he had assisted in
originating the Benevolent Asylum, the Orphan Asylum (which was originally
commenced at Kew), and the Refuge and Reformatory for Fallen Women. He was
presented with a tangible token of the most Christian character which he held
in the colony of Victoria, his manfulness in standing up in defence of whatever
he considered was right, and of the works he had done for the consolidation and
advancement of the Presbyterian Church, and of his exertions on behalf of the
morality and good of the community. This token assumed the shape of a donation
of a thousand pounds, presented on a silver salver. It was understood that the
thousand pounds was to be invested by the recipient in the formation of a scholarship
at the Theological Hall, and which would be designated the “ Cairns Jubilee
Scholarship.” When Hr. Cairns landed in Victoria it was a Crown colony, managed
by officials. Very soon after he arrived, Hr. Cairns had a large congregation around,
and precept and example were of great advantage to almost all the young members
who had come out the same time as himself. He was possessed of decision of
character, simplicity of purpose, and fidelity to noble principles. His large-heartedness
was proverbial, and rendered him prone to recognise all good works whether in his
own Church or in any other denomination. He impersonated the great qualities of
the Church he loved so well.
Hr. Adam Cairns died on the 30th January, 1881, at the advanced age of 79.
His end was not preceded by any important symptoms of illness or bodily affliction;
all he complained of was a slight weakness of the heart. He passed away peacefully
without the sign of a spasm or struggle. The cause of death was pronounced to be
an overflow of blood to the heart. He belonged to the Evangelical section of the
Presbyterian Church, and adhered strictly to orthodox views. He lived on the best
terms with the Protestant clergy of Melbourne, was the friend and associate of Bishop
Perry and Hean Macartney, and often appeared on the platform with Wesleyans,
Baptists, and Congregationalists, either to welcome new colleagues or to bid farewell
to fellow workers. The theological views of Hr. Cairns and his opinions on questions
of religious education in State schools or of Sabbath observance need not be discussed.
In private life he was genial, and always anxious to be on good terms with his fellow
men. He was as cheerful in temperament as vigorous in body. Hr. and Mrs. Cairns
brought with them to the colony one son and five daughters, of whom only three
daughters survive. His remains were interred on the Ist of February, 1881, in the
Kew Cemetery. The cortege proceeded from his house in Richmond to Chalmers
Church, where a funeral service was held and an appropriate address delivered by
the Rev. A. MacVean, Moderator of the Presbyterian Assembly. The funeral was of
great length, and was attended by clergymen from nearly every denomination, and by
a large number of the most prominent citizens of Melbourne. In the words of the
Rev. H. McKenzie, who preached the funeral oration, “ May God send the Victorians
such another in answer to their prayer.”

THE HON. BOYD DUNLOP MOREHEAD, M.L.A.
there are castes in society, so there are castes in the colonies, hut this will
laH perhaps, always exist. For centuries, England, Scotland and Ireland
have hated each other intensely, and yet when the hour of danger comes
the three haters unite to defeat the foe of the Empire. So would it be in the colonies
should such an unfortunate contingency arise. They have their disputes over many
questions which each considers to affect its interests, as far as progress and welfare
are concerned. In the United Kingdom, it is not so much the gaining of a commercial
supremacy, or having the precedence in prosperity, which creates jealousy. It is the
difference of nationalities which creates the detestation of the three peoples for each
other. In Australia this feeling is to be met with in only a few instances, and,
no doubt, it is owing to the fact of the training for the past many years of those who
have been born in the colonies. The only danger is that the traditions of the mother
country may be forgotten, and that what are considered the shackles of monarchy may
be cast aside. This would be a sad portion in the history of the British Empire, but
it is not probable the historians of the future will be called upon to chronicle such an
event. It is to the legislators of a country that we must look, and it is incumbent on
them not to be driven by their constituents. They know better what is calculated to
advance the country, preserve its morality, promote its prosperity, and raise it to a
degree of prominence, than those who give the subject of politics an hour’s hazy study
every day.
These observations have been evoked owing to the fact that we believe that
the Hon. Boyd Dunlop Morehead, M.L.A., is a legislator who has exercised his
abilities towards the advancement of his country without fear or favour. This
gentleman was born in Sydney, New South Wales, in August, 1843. His education
was at first what may be termed private, afterwards he entered the Sydney Grammar
School, and finally the University. After serving a clerkship in the Bank of New
South Wales, and acting as Inspector of Stations in Queensland for the Scottish
Australian Investment Company, he entered about the end of 1873 into mercantile
business in Brisbane on his own account. Mr. Morehead was returned for the
Mitchell in 1871. On Mr. Buzacott resigning the Postmaster-Generalship and the
leadership of the Upper House in the Mcllwraith Ministry in 1880, Mr. Morehead was
appointed as his successor. At the general elections in 1883, he contested the

/' ‘X
Fortitude Valley electorate, but unfortunately suffered a defeat. He was, however,
subsequently returned for the Balonne, the constituency which he now represents.
On the occasion of Mr. (now Sir Samuel) Griffiths’ advent to power in November, 1883,
Mr. Morehead, owing to the absence of Sir Thomas Mcllwraith in England, acted as
leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. In 1881 he accompanied Sir Arthur (then
Mr.) Palmer to Sydney, as the two representatives of Queensland at the International
Conference, which was then being held there. In March, 1886, Mr. Morehead left
for a well-earned holiday to Europe, returning in January, 1887. For the last session
he was chosen as leader of the Opposition, and in that capacity he has displa}ed
great tact, and much discretion. It may be said of him, as of many other Australian
natives, that the qualities of what constitutes manhood, socially, intellectually, and
politically, are not wanting.
THE HON. BOYD DUNLOP MOREHEAD, M.L.A.


O. F. GERLER.
F. GERLER was born in Fielenzig, a town in Prussia, on February 24,
Owing to the rules for the regulation of education in that
country, by which every child is compelled to attend school from the
age of six until fourteen years, Mr. Gerler was, of course, included amongst those
obliged to obey the regulations. For his last five years at school, he attended the
two highest classes, and received a fair education, being particularly fond of drawing.
At fifteen years of age, he was apprenticed to the fine cloth-making trade, and gained
a good knowledge of the proper use of all the machinery connected therewith, which,
by travelling on the Continent from the age of nineteen, for five years, was
considerably increased. When Mr. Gerler was twenty-two years of age, he became a
foreman in the business. At twenty-four years of age, Mr, Gerler returned to his
own native town, and intended to set up for himself; but owing to some
disagreement, he resolved to leave his town again, and accordingly went to
Sommerfield, which he had previously visited, and where he became acquainted with
the Rev. Mr. Gerlach. For some time Mr. Gerler acted as a sort of Town Missionary,
but also continued to work at his trade. Desirous of becoming better acquainted with
theology, he went to Berlin, and became a candidate at Father Gossner’s Mission
Institute. Eventually Mr. Gerler came to Sydney, which he reached on January 1,
1844. He received ordination as Missionary to the Heathen in the Bethlehem
Church, in Berlin, on August 21, 1843, by the Rev. Father Johannes Gossner. The
intention of the Rev. Father Gossner was to send him and the three other
missionaries who were his shipmates, to the New Hebrides, but Dr. Ross, of Sydney,
was quite opposed to the project, owing to the recent news that a boat’s crew
numbering sixteen had been murdered. Owing to numerous circumstances, they
were compelled, or thought it advisable, to consult Dr. Lang, who suggested that
they should set out for Moreton Bay. Previous to starting, Mr. Gerler married Miss
Sarah Thompson, a good, pious Christian girl.
Mr. Gerler’s accounts of his first attempts at building are very amusing, and
we have no doubt would entertain a number of his visitors for the evening, and his
experiences amongst the blacks would form an interesting chapter in the history of
the aborigines of Queensland. Finding, after fourteen years, that he was unable to
provide for his family, he bought Carlsburg, some five miles distant from Brisbane,
where he now resides. Mr. Gerler especially cultivated the grape vine, and was fairly
successful in the enterprise; but whilst endeavouring to obtain a livelihood for
himself, he has not been unmindful of the physical or spiritual wants of his fellow
man, as can be testified by the numbers of letters he has written, containing advice
and instruction to those who needed it. His contributions consisted of letters on


wool-sorting, wool-washing, sheep-breeding, silk-culture, the cultivation of the grape
vine, and a host of other industries inseparably connected with Australia.
Mr. Gerler is one of those happy-minded people, which, if the world did not
possess, would render mortals miserable, who seem to take an interest in everything
calculated to promote the welfare of the country. Owing to a buggy accident some
three years ago Mr. Gerler cannot undertake the same amount of work as he went
through formerly; but, nevertheless, his active brain causes him to devote a portion
of his time to the cultivation of the higher arts, such as drawing, painting, and poetry.
All his productions in these three branches of culture have been greatly admired by
those who have been privileged to inspect them. The Family Tree he made is in Indian
ink, and clearly proves the ingenuity of his mind. This tree has II branches
representing the children ; the off branches of those represent 18 grandchildren
and one great grandson, with names and particulars of each child, &c.; of the children
11 are alive, and are married. Brisbane in colours as it was in 1844, the Old Mission
Station as it was in 1846, the Grand Hotel at Southport, his birthplace in Germany
in pen and ink, and other sketches, show that Mr. Gerler possesses a high ideal of art.
His contributions to the Bulletin on the wreck of the “Scottish Prince” are well worthy
a place in any such memoirs as these, but owing to want of space we are reluctantly
compelled to forego the pleasure of reproducing them. His two pictures, the Jubilee of
Queen Victoria, in Indian ink and crayon, are well executed, and the verses he wrote
for the happy occasion give further indication of his powers as a poet. Mr. Gerler,
with many other old pioneers, shares feelings of astonishment at what has been
accomplished during his sojourn in Australia. Mr. Gerler’s experience of what he
suffered from the blacks would, if published in detail, be most interesting, judging
from the accounts we have received from him of their behaviour towards the whites.
In 1854 Mr. Gerler entered into partnership with three others in a station venture,
about 30 miles from Brisbane, but for various reasons sold out his share.
After this Mr. Gerler turned his attention to pine-apple growing for some years,
and in 1868 bought Carlsburg, his present place of residence, and cultivated the grape
vine, having planted 14,000 vines, producing in several seasons 40 tons of grapes each
year, yielding 4000 gallons of good wine, &c., but has given up wine making, as he
could sell the grapes readily wholesale. Having retired, his son Carl carries on
the vine culture. The circumstances attending the death of his daughter Paulina
Gerler, called forth from his poetic mind some verses which space precludes our
publishing. The account of her death on May 24, 1872, at the age of eighteen years,
as given by Mr. Gerler, is most singular. She was on a visit on the night of May 24
at Ipswich, and there she saw a vision—three angels, as well as her friend Miss Foot.
They immediately vanished on her seeing them, and Mr. Gerler’s daughter predicted
that she would have to be ready in three years for death, a prediction to which her
parents paid no heed, but on the day after her death, those who heard her forecast the
day and hour of her death verified the fact. Mr. Gerler is a man of sterling qualities,
and like many of his countrymen has helped to make Australia what it is, and we
hope that, although he has reached a ripe old age, he may still be spared to the
colonies for many years longer.
C. F. GERLER.


JOSEPH HENRY LITTLE.
t*l|F Morrill, who was found after wandering for fourteen years with the natives
sjCTjpj of what is now known as Queensland, could re-visit the earth, he would be
struck with wonder at the great rapidity with which this, the youngest of our
sisters, has advanced, not only commercially, or politically, but intellectually and from
a professional point of view.
The country is being rapidly opened up, townships are dotted all over it, the
produce of the land is very rich, and there is a general air of prosperity. It has been
greatly due to the efforts of the early pioneers, who fought against difficulties of no
ordinary nature, some of whom are still living to see those efforts crowned with success,
whilst those who have been called away and are now known only by name, have
bequeathed to their children and their friends a legacy which teaches the lesson of
pluck, independence, and perseverance.
With very few exceptions the majority of the early settlers had already resided
in other parts of Australia, and consequently having gained experience, were well able
to cope with the difficulties of opening up such a vast country. However, they were
not long in lacking assistance, through the influx of many of the old-world sons of
toil; each of the three countries, England, Ireland, and Scotland, supplied
their quota of men who possessed strong hearts and willing hands. The period of
which we are now speaking may be regarded as the iron age of the Colony of
Queensland, and after that comes the silver age when men began to look around them
for other things besides merely harrowing and ploughing; if ever there was a necessity
not only for the maintenance of the body, but also for the cultivation of the intellect.
Hence, we find a gradual immigration of those who not only hold up the torch of
truth, but as well those who carried with them that of science. By degrees a visible
improvement took place in the social and intellectual condition of the small knot of
settlers which were there at the time; but it was felt necessary that a still greater
improvement and advance should be made, and hence we find ourselves now on the
verge of that which may be regarded, to keep up our simile, as the golden age.
Queensland can boast of possessing some of the most distinguished men in the
different callings which engage the attention of the human brain. We have been led
to give expression to the foregoing remarks through having, in an interview with the
subject of this sketch, received a few notes of his life for insertion in the present
volume.


Mr. Joseph Henry Little, M.8., C.M., was born in the City of Kilkenny,
Ireland, in the year 1849. He was educated at the Edinburgh University, and arrived
in Melbourne in the year 1871. There he held the position of medical officer in the
Benevolent Asylum, and was resident surgeon at the Melbourne Hospital. He next
came to Queensland, where we find him holding the position of surgeon to the
Maryborough and Charters Towers hospitals. In 1879 he took a trip to England,
where he remained for three years; setting out again for the land of his adoption, we
find him practising in Brisbane for the past six years. He is surgeon to the Brisbane
Hospital, and has been appointed to the distinguished position of President of the
Medical Society of Queensland for the year 1888.
JOHN PETRIE.
PETRIE was born January 15, 1822, at Edinburgh, Scotland, and
«i| arrived with his parents in Sydney, N.S.W., on the “ Stirling Castle,”
in 1831. He received his education at the Rev. Hr. Lang’s Church Hill
School, Sydney. In 1837 he proceeded to Moreton Bay (then a penal settlement), with
his father, who held an appointment in the Royal Engineer’s Department. Since that
date the subject of this sketch has been a resident of Brisbane, and therefore deserves
to be ranked as one of the founders of Queensland. In the first municipal contest
held in Brisbane, 1859, Mr. Petrie was elected at the head of the poll, as alderman.
At that date Brisbane was in New South Wales. He was chosen as first mayor of
Brisbane, and held that important office for three years, and while acting as mayor
the distinguished honor devolved upon him of receiving the first Governor of the
colony, Sir G. F. Bowen, on December 10th, 1859. For many years he served as
alderman, and he has been a Justice of the Peace from a date anterior to the
separation of the colony from N.S.W. He was appointed one of the original members
of the Brisbane Board of Waterworks; is now and has been for several years chairman
of that board. He is also Chairman of the Brisbane Hospital Committee, a member
of the Licensing Board, and of several other important public boards. Mr. Petrie
was the first candidate initiated into the first Masonic Lodge constituted in North
Australia. In early days, together with, his father, he entered upon extensive
exploring expeditions. They were the first white men to ascend one of the
Glasshouse Mountains, and to describe to Dr. Leichhardt the best way up the
mountain, which he ascended some time afterwards. Mr. Petrie has witnessed the
growth of Queensland from a small penal settlement to what it now is. In 1850 he
married Miss M‘Knight, who is still living, and in good health. The wonderful
development of the colony, and the rapid growth of Brisbane, have gone on under the
eye of this early pioneer, who endured many of the privations incidental to pioneer
life, but now finds his declining years cast in pleasant places, and in a land destined,
at no distant date, to become the vanguard of Australian civilization.
JOSEPH HENRY LITTLE.




John Stevenson MLA.


JOHN STEVENSON.
{ |l||N Australia successful men have- not lain on beds of roses, but rather on
Ml thorns, and it is no doubt owing to the fact that since “ Sweet are the uses
of adversity,” they have been enabled to raise themselves into positions of
prominence. Such men are useful to the country of their adoption or birth,
inasmuch as they have been compelled, in order to reach the desired goal, to closely
observe the events of their time. Every man in this world is on probation, and is
fully conscious of this fact; he must be circumspect, which in other words means he
must look around him, and especially so in the colonies. Many men of this stamp
are to be found in the colonies and we cannot do better than introduce to our readers
one who is well-known for his enterprise and straightforward manner —Mr. John
Stevenson. It is said that Bismarck, the “ man of blood and iron,” is a lion in his
office but a lamb in his home ; and so may it be with others than the renowned and
famous Prince whose name will live for centuries after he is gone. Perhaps there is
no part of the United Kingdom, whence population flows to this land, which
contributes a finer specimen of true manliness than that of Scotland. It is
undeniable that Scotchmen are keen, but it is indisputable that they are honest.
They are lions in business, but lambs in the discharge of their honorable debts, and
it is owing to these attributes that so many successful Scotchmen are to be met with.
One of these successful Scotchmen is the gentleman whose name we have already
mentioned. He is the son of the late James Stevenson, of the Hall of Aberuthven,
Perthshire, Scotland, and was born in 1843, was educated at the local schools, and
the Perth seminaries. Mr. Stevenson came to Queensland in 1864, and at once
engaged in pastoral pursuits, having for several years managed a station for the Earl
of Macclesfield. In 1869, he turned his attention to squatting on his own account,
an enterprise in which he has met with considerable success, and he is still largely
interested in station properties. In 1883 he became a member of the well-known
firm of B. D. Morehead and Co., and for a long time managed and still takes an
active interest in the stock and station branch of their extensive business,
which his shrewdness, integrity and enterprise have contributed so largely to its
augmentation.
Mr. Stevenson has been a member of the Queensland Parliament
continuously since 1875, first having represented Clermont, and subsequently was
twice returned for Normanby, his present constituency. In politics he has always


been a loyal, but, by no means, slavish member of the so-called Conservative party.
Mr. Stevenson has taken a prominent part in the legislation connected with the
alienation of Crown Lands, the establishment of Divisional Boards, the initiation of
the Mail Contract with the British India Company, and other progressive measures.
In helping to force through the House what he approves of, or in “ stonewalling ” a
distasteful proposal, Mr. Stevenson is a host in himself. In private life he has
gained very many friends, all of whom can testify to his sterling social qualities, and
some of them are sure to remember a kindness of heart which has been rendered
memorable to them, not only on account of its substantial quality, but also through
the unostentatious manner in which it was imparted. Mr. Stevenson has always
expressed his approval of Colonial self-defence, and has taken an active part in the
Volunteer movement, he himself being now Major of the Queensland Scottish
Rifles, the premier company in Queensland.
HON. EDWARD BARROW FORREST, M.L.C.
Spi'pN presenting a portrait of the Hon. Mr. Forrest, in accordance with the
ilf iEa s P ec * a l re fl ues f of that gentleman, we give below but a brief outline of his
career. He was born in England in February, 1838, and received his
education at King’s School, Parramatta, New South Wales. On leaving school he
joined the services of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in Sydney, and with this
company remained until 1872, when he became a member of the firm of Parbury,
Lamb and Co., of Brisbane, Queensland, of which he is at present the managing
partner. Taking an active part in the commercial development of the colony, his
services have been secured as a Director of the Brisbane Gas Company, the Australian
Mutual Provident Society, and of the Imperial Insurance Company. Mr. Forrest
at an early date became a boating man, several of the best known boats have carried
his flag, and he now owns the “ Isabel,” the fastest yacht in Queensland waters. To
Mi. Foirest s exeitions in no small degree it may be said that yachting is flourishing
in Brisbane. When the Liisbaue Sailing Club came into existence, Mr. Forrest was
elected Vice-Commodoie. He has held the position ol Vice-Consul for France since
1872. On Maich 10, 1883, he was called to the Legislative Council of Queensland,
and still retains his seat in that chamber.
JOHN STEVENSON.


HON. SIR THOMAS McIL WRAITH, KC.M.G.
subject of this sketch, the present Premier of Queensland (June
MB 1888), was born at Ayr, Scotland, in 1835. He received his primary
education in his native town, completing the same at the Glasgow
University. Having completed his course as a civil engineer, he arrived in
Melbourne, Victoria, in 1854, where he was engaged as Civil Engineer to the Victorian
railways. Becoming convinced that Queensland had before it a great future, and
that it was only a question of time when it must from its natural resources find itself
the leading colony of Australia, he, in 1861, became interested in Squatting pursuits
in the north, and in 1870, became a permanent resident of Brisbane. Taking a deep
interest in the welfare of the colony, and feeling the necessity for making his views not
only public, he entered Parliament for the first time in 1869, representing the Warrego
and Maranoa for many years. In 1873, he became a member of the Macalister
Ministry as Minister for Works, but tendered his resignation in a short time. He
was elected to represent Mulgrave in 1878, and upon the defeat of the Douglas
Administration in 1879, he was called upon to form a Ministry, which he did,
becoming for the first time Premier of Queensland. This Administration continued
to hold the seals of office until 1883, when in consequence of two adverse votes, it
resigned, and Mr. Griffith became Premier. Among the prominent acts of the
Administration was the annexation of New Guinea, a proceeding which for prescience
has never been equalled by any Australian statesman. To Sir Thomas “ Coming
events cast their shadows before,” and read in the light of subsequent events, the
annexation would have given the entire island to the British Empire, but
unfortunately the policy did not meet with the approval of Downing-street,
the result being that a foreign Continental power has been enabled
to secure a foothold and establish a colony within easy striking
distance of an Australian colony. After his resignation in 1883, Sir
Thomas, accompanied by Lady Mcllwraith, paid a visit to England and the
Continent, and while in Scotland the freedom of his native place (Ayr) was conferred
upon him. Sir Thomas, in consequence of the pressure of private business resigned
his position as leader of the Opposition. In 1887, on the expiration of the
Parliamentary term, he w'as induced to again enter public life, and at once assumed
the position of leader of the Opposition. The struggle was intense in its character,
being without a parallel in Queensland political warfare. Ihe policy which he
enunciated was appropriately designated as “National, a term which was at once
accepted by Sir Thomas. He offered himself as a candidate for the most impoitant
constituency in the colony, viz., Brisbane. His opponents were Sir Samuel W. Giiffith,
the Premier, and Mr. Brooks, and as the Riding was believed to bo overwhelmingly
Liberal in its predilections many were the doubts felt as to the result, even by the
most enthusiastic friends of Sir Thomas. The result proved that he had gauged the


popular re-action in his behalf, as he was returned at the head of the poll, having a
majority of nearly 500 over Sir Samuel. The constituency has therefore the honour
of being represented in Parliament by the respective leaders of the two great political
parties in Queensland. When the House assembled the resignation of the Ministry
was placed in the hands of the Governor, the general election having resulted in the
return of a majority of 18 members in favour of a change in the Administration. Sir
Thomas was at once sent for and formed a Ministry.
DAVID J. CHILDS.
cultivation of the vine in Australia at no distant date promises to be one
ie mos * i m P or^ industries. Queensland possesses all the natural
requirements, namely, cheap land, with almost every variety of soil,
variation of temperature according to the elevation, and the absence of spring frosts.
The great drawback is the absence of a market capable of keeping pace with the supply.
The culture of the grape in California furnishes a parallel case, and also demonstrates
that it is only a question of time when wines made beyond the confines of Europe are
destined to win their way. Owing to the ravages of the phylloxera, the Italian,
French and Spanish supply is constantly decreasing, while the consumption of wine
in Europe shows a steady increase. The demand must be met. Once our growers
come to understand the wants of the foreign markets, diligent care, scientific skill and
careful selection of locality must triumph over prejudice, and place the Australian
wines amongst the best of the world.
We are daily brought into more intimate relations with the markets of the
world, and the recent formation in London of a company with ample capital, for
dealing exclusively in Australian wines, demonstrates that a demand has set in, which
is only the herald of that which is to follow.
David J. Childs was born at Stringstone, Somersetshire, England, in March,
1844, and arrived at Moreton Bay with his parents in January, 1849, in the ship
“ Fortitude,” that vessel landing the first of the shipments of middle-class immigrants,
who were sent out that year through the patriotic efforts of Dr. Lang. Mr. Childs
received his early education at the following private schools :—Messrs. Scoot’s, Jame’s,
the Bev. Mr. Mowbray’s, and Mr. Cavassor’s. His first venture in life was on the
Burnett, where he was employed for two years on Messrs. Ridler’s stations, from whence
he travelled sheep to the Suttor River, Upon his return to Brisbane he commenced
grape growing and the manufacture of wine at Nudgee, ten miles from the capital,
which pursuit he still follows successfully. To his credit be it said, that he is the
only vigneron in Queensland who manufactures champagne and other sparkling wines.
In 1878 he was appointed a magistrate, a position which he still holds with credit ;
and in the same year he was elected Worshipful Master of the North Australian Lodge
of Freemasons, it being the oldest lodge in the colony. After having served for seven
years as a Divisional Boardsman, he retired.

DENIS O’DONOVAN, E.R.S.L., F.R.G.S., Ac.
give a fully detailed account of the life of this gentleman and do
justice to him, it would be necessary to devote the major part of this
volume to his biography, and it is to be regretted that want of space
precludes the accomplishment of such an agreeable duty, seeing that he is
not only a worthy representative of literature and scholarship in the Australian
colonies but one who is well-known in literary and learned circles in Europe and
America.
Mr. O’Donovan was born on the 23rd August, 1836, in the County of Cork,
Ireland. He comes of one of the noblest of the houses of Munster —a family which
traces its descent by documentary proof to the Kings of that province, and was
allied not only with the proudest chiefs and nobles of its native land, hut with
the Royal Plantagenets of England. One lady of the family was one of the
fore-mothers of the present Marshal McMahon, through a marriage with the
son of the Lord of Gloncare, whose daughter married Patrick MacMahon, Esq.,
of Torrodile. The ancestor in modern times of the subject of the present
memoir was Donnell 11. O’Donovan of Castle O’Donovan, in the County of
Cork, by his first wife Helena, granddaughter of Viscount Buttevant. Many of the
family were distinguished both in learning and arms. General Richard O’Donovan
was an intimate friend of the Prince Regent and of the Duke of York, whose life he
saved in the retreat from Holland ; another Richard O’Donovan, a doctor of the
University of Toulouse, was an eminent scholar; Denis O’Donovan of Forenaght,
seems to have united in himself fame of both kinds, as he is described in a poem by
Conor Cam O’Daly as “ a pillar of battle,” and his “ dear and learned alumnus.”
Of the two fields of glory in which so many members of his family won
renown, the subject of this sketch selected the one in which literary laurels are to be
reaped—though if rumour speaks correctly, he once handled the sword with
considerable skill. His earliest teachers were a clergyman of the Church of
Hngland, and a private tutor who was a Doctor of the University of Salamanca.
At an early age he was sent to school in France, and subsequently became a student
at the Sorbonne, in Paris, following the medical lectures at the same time in
the Ecole de Medecine of that city. During his University career, and afterwards,
he devoted great attention to the study of Greek, and obtained a high reputation
as a Hellenist.


On the completion of his studies and before selecting any particular profession,
lie travelled over a great portion of Europe, lingering especially in Italy, where he
attended lectures in several of the Universities, and became an ardent student of the
art and antiquities of the country. One of the results of these travels was his well-
known work, “ Memories of Rome,” which received the highest encomiums from the
leading journals and most distinguished personages in Europe. Pope Pius. IX. sent
the author a medal as a mark of his appreciation of the work, while the Queen of Spain,
the Cardinal Archbishop of Dublin, and other celebrities in Church and State, wrote
him most complimentary letters—some of his countrymen sending him by the hands
of a distinguished Irishman, then visiting Paris, a gold medal with an appropriate
inscription. A London paper declared it to be “ the best book we know of the kind.”
The late Monsieur Philarete Chasles, the eminent Professor of Modern Literature at
the College dc France, and learned author of Trente annus de Critique, expressed in one
of his public lectures the following high eulogium on “ Memories of Rome.” “If
you would know the Rome of the present, the manners of its inhabitants—of the
people, of the Bourgeoisie, of the Aristocracy—if you desire to comprehend the artistic
and religious movement of which this wondrous capital is the centre, read the admirable
work of Mr. O’Donovan. For touching grace, winning eloquence, charming imagery,
picturesque description, and, above all, for the enlightened spirit of tolerance which
pervades it, ‘ Memories of Rome’ cannot be too highly praised. Mr. O’Donovan
seems one of those rare intelligences of whom the great Goethe speaks who unite to
the force of persuasion, a charm of diction, an indulgence for the errors of others, an
absence of rancour and of hatred which makes us love whatever he loves and admire
whatever he admires. Nothing in the whole range of English literature is more
admirable than the beautiful pages in which he bids farewell to Rome. Casting a last
glance upon that cenotaph of ages he pours forth that eloquent impassioned adieu
which is surpassed by nothing of the kind in ancient or modern letters.” When a
schoolboy in Ireland, Mr. O’Donovan published a volume of poems (one of which was
in Latin), and prose papers which attracted the notice of Cardinal Wiseman. One of
the poems had the honour of being selected for a place in “ Gems from Catholic
Poets.” Soon after the publication of “ Memories of Rome,” Mr. O’Donovan returned
to Paris, where he became Professor of Modern Languages and Literature in the College dcs
Hautes Etudes, afterwards the Catholic University of Paris, and lecturer in one of the
Colleges of the University of France. In the former institution he had for colleagues
such eminent men as Monsieur Yieille, Inspector-General of the University,
Lieutenant-Colonel Dionis, Monsieur Egger, the great Hellenist, Monsigneur Cruice,
afterwards Bishop of Marseilles, and Mgr. Hugonin, the present Bishop of Bayeux.
The two last-named have written of their connection with Mr. O’Donovan in terms
of which he may well feel proud. It was during this time that Mr. O’Donovan became
connected with the Paris Press, and soon made himself known as a powerful master
of French prose by his writings in the Ami dc la Religion, a leading daily paper of the
time. His appointment as one of the redacteurs of this journal was referred to in
highly eulogistic terms by John Mitchell in a letter to the Irish American, for which


be was then Paris correspondent. This position brought Mr. O’Donovan into the
circle of such eminent men as Thiers, Guizot, Rouher, Crcmieux, Montalembert,
Dupanloup, Cardinal Morlot, Prince Galitzin (a colleague of his on the Ami) the late
Emperor Napoleon 111., and a host of other distinguished personages. It was during
one of his interviews with the Emperor that the conversation having turned on the
Philosophumena, a Greek MS. on which Bunsen, Canon Wordsworth, and Pressense
had founded some fierce anti-Papal attacks, that Mr. O’Donovan mentioned a work on
which his friend the Abbe Cruice was then engaged in connection with the subject—
“ The history of the Church in the Pontificates of St. Victor, St. Zephyrinus, and St.
Calixtus.” The Emperor became interested in the matter, and the result was that
M. Cruice was induced to edit (with some assistance from Mr. O’Donovan) the text
of the Philosophumena, to which he added a Latin translation and some comments, and
his Majesty had the work printed at the expense of the State.
In addition to corresponding for some of the English and Irish newspapers,
Mr. O’Donovan, at the time to which we are alluding, wrote a short memoir of the
late Bishop of Orleans (the celebrated Dupanloup), which was afterwards translated
into French, and which the bishop in his letter of thanks to the author calls “ a truly
elegant production.” He also wrote a pamphlet in French on the distress then
prevailing in Ireland, which drew considerable attention to the subject, and helped to
stimulate, not only in France, but in other countries, the charity that was bountifully
exhibited on the occasion. In 1864 Mr. O’Donovan removed to London, where he
resided about two years, and in 1866 he visited the Australian colonies, but with
no intention of making them his permanent home. He was so pleased, however,
with the climate, and attracted by some peculiar features in the field of labour which
here presented itself, that he has remained ever since in this part of the world. In
Melbourne he devoted himself especially both on the press and from the platform to
spreading amongst these new communities a knowledge of art and a love of the
beautiful. Some of his lectures, delivered at the Public Library in that city, were
published by the Technological Commission of Victoria, and circulated gratuitously
through the colony. He was a warm advocate for the establishment of Schools of
Design, and by his efforts materially assisted the practical means of bringing art to
the homes and the workshops of the Victorian artisans.
In 1874 he accepted the office of Parliamentary Librarian of Queensland, a
position for which he was eminently qualified by reason of the proficiency he had
acquired during his long residence on the Continent of Europe in bibliography
and library science, an experience rarely found even in England, where these matters
have only of late attracted attention. His special suitability for the position was
amply shown by a series of articles which he wrote in the Melbourne Argus, on
the Public Library of that city, but much more decisively by the catalogue which
he has lately produced —a work which is admitted to be a remarkable contribution
to the bibliography of the world. Dr. Alpheus Todd, C.M.G., Parliamentary
Librarian of Canada, the great authority on Parliamentary Government, says of
this production that “it stands pre-eminent.” The Librarians of the British

Museum, ol the House of Commons, of the Bodleian Library, of the Bibliotheque
Ste. Genevieve in France; eminent men like Lord Rosebery, the Duke of Manchester,
Lord Carnarvon, and Sir Henry Brougham Loch, bear similar testimony to the ability
and research displayed in this “ standard work of reference, so useful wherever
there is a large collection of books.” It would be difficult for the colonists of
Queensland, when so many English and Foreign authorities acknowledge the worth
of Mr. O’Donovan, not to feel proud of their Parliamentary Librarian. A page
ot this volume might be tilled with extracts from all the most celebrated papers
in the world as to the merits of his great work, which has been called by some
writers a Bibliographical Cyclopaedia. Its utility is so great that applications from
all parts of the world have been made for copies of the book.
Mr. O’Donovan, though necessarily absorbed to a great extent in the arduous
labours he has imposed on himself, has found time to be of use in some other
directions. His familiarity with so many European languages attracts to him almost
every foreigner who is in difficulty or trouble in Brisbane. The Italian residents in
Queensland presented him some few years ago with a very beautiful address, thanking
him for what he had done for colonists of their nationality. The artists of Melbourne
also presented him with an address accompanied by a valuable sapphire ring to
mark their gratitude and admiration for his labours. His career and character
cannot be better summed up than in the words of a Melbourne paper which we
have before our eyes ;—“ A more unobtrusive and withal polished gentleman
does not breathe the air of Australia. To the French he is French and a friend; to
the sons of Italy he is an Italian and the idol of the many to whom he is ever ready to
lend a helping hand. Let us sum him up in a few words—scholar, artist, gentleman;
how few there are to whom the terms may be correctly applied !” He is a Fellow of
the Royal Society of Literature (England), the Geographical Society (England), the
Incorporated Society of Authors (England), the Society of Science, Letters and Arts
(England), and a Member of the Society of Arts (England), and of the Library
Association of the United Kingdom. He is corresponding member ( causa honoris ) of
the Societes dc Geographic Commercials of Paris and Havre, and Honorary Member of
the Societe d’Anthropologic of Paris.




George Fairbairn


GEORGE EAIRBAIRN.
JMe have secured the following facts in reference to Mr. Fairbairn, one of
ie pioneers of the colony of Victoria. We regret that Mr. Fairbairn’s
reluctance to furnish us data renders the sketch incomplete, but this is
due to his innate modesty.
George Fairbairn was born in the year 181G, and brought up in the border
county of Berwickshire, where his father, like many other men of substance in those
days, occupied a considerably-sized sheep and agricultural farm. The year of his
birth and the year 1879 have been perhaps the two most disastrous years to sheep
farmers and agriculturists, as the sheep were lost and the crops ruined.
Mr. Fairbairn left home in the year 1838 for Adelaide, and on arrival joined,
in company with his two cabin passengers, two persons camped at Holdfast Bay.
Dissatisfied with the look of the country, they left Holdfast Bay, where they had
remained for over two months, after hearing from two of their party who had gone to
the Port Phillip district for the purpose of inspecting it, and arrived at the present
city of Melbourne at the end of March, 1839. Mr. Fairbairn a few days afterwards
went up to the station, which had six thousand sheep and a few hundred cattle on it,
at what is now known as Ballan. There he acted as manager of the purchase until
it was sold eighteen months after. One of the party, his particular friend, started off
with the stock to Lal-Lal, but judging the country not to be suitable for pastoral
purposes, they sold out. Arriving in Melbourne, the subject of this sketch remained
few months. He had a fair opportunity of judging what a “ boom” in land means out
in this country, since at that time most furious speculation was carried on in real
estate. Owing to various circumstances, chief of which was carrying on transactions
with paper only, a re-action set in, many people being ruined. As an instance of the
state of affairs then, we may mention that sheep were sold for fifty times less than
their value, and pinching poverty compelled several people to “ swop” their jewellery
for board and lodging.
Being in a state of uncertainty, Mr. Fairbairn accepted the position of manager
of a station at Glenelg, which was infested with hostile blacks, whom he very strongly
objected to fight; he, however, in the absence of all police protection, adopted the
plan of pacifying the blacks, and succeeded in doing so in eighteen months time, but
not without having had three or four severe skirmishes with them, the blacks resorting
to their well-known tactics of carrying off sheep, every raid realising a loss of from
300 to 500 sheep. Mr. Fairbairn’s experiences during this time were not of the
most pleasant description, as ho was in a somewhat similar state to that which has


been undergone for many years in Ireland by landlords and their agents ; and it was
not until they succeeded in getting the blacks to come in to the station, where they
proved themselves very useful, that he or any other white man there had peace of
mind. During the four years which he held the management of this station, it
having then been sold, he bought an adjoining one, which he held till 1858. In the
meantime the gold rush had broken out, and he was left without a single hand in
charge of 10,000 sheep, but he managed, with the aid of half-a-dozen good horses, to
keep the bulk of the sheep together until some of the men, after six months time,
returned from the diggings. Mr. Fairbairn also visited the diggings at Bendigo,
and succeeded in obtaining in two days’ work 11 ounces, for which, when he went to
Melbourne, he received £24 15s. He lost it, however, in a shorter time than it took
him to make it, for it was abstracted from his outside pocket by a clever thief at a
cricket match at Emerald Hill. Afterwards he went to Ballarat to buy gold, and had
transactions with the squatters who brought their sheep there for sale, from whom he
received the notes which they got as the price of the sheep sold. These notes he had
no difficulty in exchanging for gold at two guineas an ounce. Having in his possession
from 500 to 1000 ounces of gold, he rode to Melbourne through the bush, and sold it
at from £2 ss. to £2 Bs. per ounce. Returning on the third day, he repaid the sums
of money lent him by his friends the squatters, and after making £IOOO at this risky
trade, which lasted for two months, he bade farewell to the diggings, and went to
England, where he remained until the year 1861.
Returning from England, he purchased a station on the Murrumbidgee, and
from then until now has been chiefly occupied in buying unimproved land in New
South Wales and Queensland, which he developes by fencing, watering, and
stocking.
In the year 1864 Mr. Fairbairn was elected to represent Dundas in the
Victorian Assembly. The Parliament was a short-lived one ; but, as Mr. Farbairn
says, “ But long enough for me to perceive that I had neither time nor
inclination to continue a political career, so I declined to become a candidate
again.” It fell to Mr. Fairbairn’s lot to be perhaps the first to communicate an
account of the Bell-Coleman process for producing dry air at a temperature below
zero, read by him in the columns of the Times whilst staying in London. He wrote
to his brother-in-law, F. Armytage, Esq., who entered ardently into the subject.
Portions of the letter, describing the process of producing frozen meat, were published
in the Argus. Mr. Armytage also succeeded in securing the influence of Sir James
McCulloch, who was aided by a number of those interested in obtaining a new market
for meat. k few months afterwards a trial shipment by the Stratlfleven was sent to
England.
In a short time this business was developed into a very large trade, and though
at present it is from various causes unprofitable, yet there is little doubt it will again
be revived, and prove of considerable value to Australia.
GEORGE FAIRBAIRN.


RICHARD GAILEY.
aR. GAILEY was born in the County of Donegal, Ireland, on the 22nd of
April, 1834. His parents were of Scotch extraction, their forefathers
having fled to Ireland to escape the religions persecution of former times.
He attended the parish school until 17 years of age, at which period he had acquired
a sound education, and was specially fond of mathematics. At this time he joined an
uncle who was a country builder, and worked with him for three years as a carpenter,
and was afterwards employed by a firm of contractors from Belfast for two years on
the erection of a very large mansion. With them he succeeded in becoming a
foreman, and left them to join in a partnership with a builder in Londonderry, This
partnership lasted about six years, during which time they erected many churches,
schools, dwellings and warehouses, besides adding to and repairing some of the
fortification son the coast of Ireland for the Government. During nearly the whole
of this time Mr. Gailey attended a course of instruction in drawing, architectural
design and engineering, under the superintendence of the late John Steedman,
architect and engineer for the County of Donegal. The special object was to obtain
the position of Superintendent of Works under the Board of Ordnance, and if possible
to be transferred to some of the colonies in that capacity. The position was finally
declined, and he commenced practice as an architect at Londonderry where he was
fairly successful. When about 28 years of age he had a slight acquaintance with the
Rev. Dr. Bowen, father of Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland, who
then held a parish near Londonderry, and by him was induced to visit Australia. He
left Liverpool in November, 1863, and arrived in Melbourne in February, 1864
intending to return to Manchester in 1865 and join in partnership with a contractor.
After travelling through Victoria and New South Wales he arrived in Brisbane about
May, 1864. He there engaged as foreman and manager for Mr. Beauchamp, who was
then contractor for the large warehouse of Christopher Newton and Co., Eagle
street. Subsequently he acted as clerk of works for Mr. J. Cowlishaw for a short time,
and then began the practice of his profession as an architect; to this he shortlv
after added that of licensed surveyor under the Real Property Act, in which dual
capacity he has remained up to the present time, and from his designs many of the
important buildings in Brisbane have been erected. During his residence in Brisbane
he has acted as valuator for one of the principal building societies and some of the
important loan companies. Mr. Gailey acquired property in the city and suburbs in
the early days which has now become very valuable. He has recently, while engaged
in the erection of the large premises and offices for the Brisbane Newspaper Company,
purchased a one-third share in the company, but he takes no active part in the
management of the papers. Mr. Gailey married in 1867 a lady from Belfast, Ireland,
by whom there is an issue of two daughters and three sons.

Kev. E. Freeman, Brown’s Eiver, Hobart Town ; King’s School,
Parramatta, N.S.W.; and Mr. Henry Standish, of Brussels. In 1843 Mr. Hart
accompanied his father (the late Mr. William Hamilton Hart), to Sydney, the latter
being the Superintendent of the Bank of Australasia. He returned to England in
1849. In 1853 father and son returned to Melbourne, where Mr. Hart senior
established the firm of Bright Bros. & Co., the subject of this sketch entering the
services of the same as a junior clerk. The rapid development of Queensland opened
up a new field for commercial enterprise, and in 1862 he was selected by his employers
to open a branch establishment in that colony. In September of that year business
was commenced in Queen-street, Brisbane, in rooms recently occupied by the
Queensland National Bank as a board room. In 1881, the designation of the firm
was changed to Gibbs, Bright & Co. Mr. Hart has continued as resident partner up
to the present time. In consequence of his thorough knowledge of the commercial
requirements of Queensland, he was in 1869 appointed a member of the Marine
Board of the colony, being subsequently gazetted as vice-chairman. Fully
comprehending the future wants of the squatting,.shipping, and mercantile classes
of Queensland, he in 1872 took an active part in the formation of the Queensland
National Bank, an institution which has so largely contributed to the wonderful growth
of the great north-eastern colony. At the first meeting of the shareholders of the
bank he was elected a Director, and became the first Chairman of the Board of
Directors, a position which he has held continuously ever since. Mr. Hart has been
intimately identified with many public companies, holding seats as Director of
numerous boards. He is at present a Director of the Queensland Land Mortgage
and Investment Company, and the Mutual Assurance Society of Victoria. In July,
1872, he was summoned to the Legislative Council, where he has brought to bear
upon all public questions his thorough knowledge of commercial affairs. In the
discharge of his duties he has been fearless and outspoken, fully maintaining as a
legislator the high reputation which he has established as a man of business and
an honored private citizen. With Queensland he has cast his lot, her interests are
his interests, and no public man in the colony has evinced greater prescience than
has Mr. Hart when forecasting and providing for the trade, commerce, and
multitudinous wants of the people.

HON. WILLIAM GRAHAM, M.L.C.
cent enary of Australia has called forth so many eulogistic and flattering
art i c^es J n °l only from the Colonial Press, but also from the great
authorities of public opinion in the land we all adore, that it seems
superfluous to attempt to give an account of the conquests that have been made in
this new land of Australia. Within a century, what has not been accomplished ?
We started with a body of convicts, we eradicated that element, and we are able to
prove by figures, which are facts, that no country has progressed as rapidly as
Australia. We should be careful in taking the opinions of new comers, as to our
material or spiritual progress. It may be that the new arrival pays a flying visit to
the various colonies, and holds a position which causes him to be so treated and
received everywhere as to cause him to think there is no place on earth like
Australia. He has merely seen the rosy side of things. On the other hand, a
capitalist comes out to Australia for the purpose of investing, and, after having
inspected and studied the prospects of investment, leaves disappointed, the flowery
reports he heard of the resources of the country leading him to believe that thousands
would in a few months be turned into millions. He consequently holds up to view
the dark side of the picture. Our two imaginary personages do incalculable injury
to any country they may visit. Again, what is a man’s opinion worth, as to
Australia, who has only been in it a few months ? He has not seen the one
hundredth part of it, and his public speeches concerning the colonies are only another
specimen of “nigger” stump oratory. The best criticism of a country’s resources
or of a man’s life, is an account of what that man has accomplished with the resources
at his disposal. The man who succeeds, after years of plodding, in securing a
competency, must be regarded as one who has worshipped and prayed. We know
what the Great Teacher said on the subject—His advice being that actions, not words,
were the true test of manhood. It is to be hoped that the fears entertained by many
in the colonies of the likelihood of the rising generation of colonials being unfit,
through their own dispositions, of continuing the work of developing the country,
may be unfounded. There are, however, some grounds for this apprehension. The
Australian native is too fond of amusement, but in justice to him it must be said that
climate and circumstances are against his making an effort to better his condition.
The two potent factors which urge men on and move them to the struggle—cold and
hunger—are unknown to the colonies, and it will only be when the Australian sees
the importance, and acts upon that knowledge, of working to place his country in a


leading position, that he will earnestly labour, either physically or intellectually. Of
course, it is admitted on all hands that the men who made the country what it is
hail from the United Kingdom, one of whom is the subject of this sketch. William
Graham, who was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1836, is the second son of the
late William Graham, LL.D. He was educated at the High School and Edinburgh
University, and came to Queensland in the year 1855. Mr. Graham was, about four
years from his arrival, in New England, obtaining colonial experience by droving
stock and managing a station. About 1859 he came to the Darling Downs, where,
for twelve years, he was engaged in droving and the management of stations for
Messrs. Kent and Weinholt, including Rosalie Plains and Jondaryan. In 1871 he
went into a successful partnership in pastoral pursuits, with the late Mr. D. Williams,
the railway contractor. In 1875 he was elected to represent the Darling Downs in
the Legislative Assembly, which he continued to do for four years, when he
unsuccessfully contested the same electorate. Shortly afterwards Mr. Graham was
nominated to the Legislative Council, where he now sits, and pays, notwithstanding
the pastoral and other business pursuits in which he is engaged, great attention
to his Parliamentary duties.
HON. WILLIAM GRAHAM, M.L.C.


FRANZ JOSEPH AUGUST RODE.
JOSEPH AUGUST RODE was born on the 18th July, 1811, at
||Schmiegroda, a village on the River Barge, one mile from the town of
Uf||p Trachenberg, in the Province of Silesia, Prussia. He was the youngest
son but one of a family of seven children, and received an ordinary education to the
age of fifteen years. His parents were both Roman Catholics, and he was reared in
that faith.
At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed for five years to the cabinet trade in
the city of Breslau. During the whole five years he never received one farthing
wages, and his hours in winter were from five in the morning to ten at night, and in
summer from five in the morning to seven in the evening. During his apprenticeship
he attended a night school. On Sundays he attended the School of Arts studies in
drawing and mathematics. After his apprenticeship, he tiavelled as a journeyman
to improve his knowledge of his trade, and whilst on Ins journey, he stopped some
twelve months in the town of Barman, on the river Rooper. For a long time he never
felt that the Catholic faith satisfied the cravings of his inner life, and it was during
his sojourn in Barman, that he was led by an unseen hand to enter the Protestant
Church, and, under the ministration of the Rev. F. W. Prummacher, D.D., the
minister of the Anglican Church of that town, he left the faith of his early training,
to follow the teaching of the Protestant religion. From the time he accepted the
Protestant faith, he felt an anxiety to take an active place in the work, and felt called
to preach to the heathen of other lands. Still ho hesitated to take such a step, and
went to Berlin, where he worked at his trade for some four or five years, but still
felt that his calling should be changed, and this determined him to visit Braingfield,
who held the position of doctor for the eyes, and whom he had to consult for
weakness. Braingfield, on seeing him enter his room, without either speaking or
knowing the object of his visit, said, “ This young man is called to preach to the
heathen.” This and after visits led him, about twelve months after, to decide to
study in Gosner’s College, established for training missionaries. He still supported
himself by his trade during his college training. There he met with eleven others,
who afterwards accepted the call, through Dr. Lang, to establish a mission at Port
Phillip Dr Lang remarked that their influence would be strengthened by partners
in their new life, and eight out of the twelve found wives to accompany them. On
the 10th of July, 1837, they left by post to Hamburg, and thence to Leith by


steamer ; thence to Edinburgh, and by canal boat, drawn by two horses, to Glasgow;
then to Greenock by steamer. On arriving there, they met Dr. Lang, who informed
them that the “ Portland” vessel was full, and they had to wait seven weeks for the
next vessel, the “ Minerva.”
During Mr. and Mrs. Lode’s stay in Greenock, they stayed with Mrs. Mackay,
mother-in-law of Dr. Lang, and Mr, Lode speaks of the Christian character and
kindness of Mrs. Mackay.
The “ Minerva left Greenock on August the 13th, 1837, and arrived in
Sidney on the 25th January, 1838, with two hundred and thirty-five (235)
immigrants , but fever having broken out, they were placed in quarantine for some
time. On leaving the quarantine station, they left Sydney on the 20th March, in
the schooner “ Isabella,” for Moreton Bay.
-Che alteration from Port Phillip to Moreton Bay for the scene of Mr. Rode’s
labours, with the other missionaries, was decided on by Dr. Lang and the Presbyterian
Church. Upon their arrival with letters to Commodore Cotton, stationed at Brisbane,
who received them with the greatest kindness, they were enabled to start a mission
station about six miles from Brisbane, on the bank of a creek which was afterwards
named Kedron Brook. The mission station was called Zion’s Hill, afterwards
changed to Perman station. Mr. Rode’s early life in Queensland as a missionary to
the aboriginals was surrounded by many dangers, and if it had not been for his
etermmation, courage, and endurance, he, with the others, who had given up so
much, would have been compelled to abandon the attempt to Christianise a race which
proved to be treacherous, deceitful, lazy, and cannibals. Their intercourse with the
escaped prisoners prevented much good being done; and although he, with the other
missionaries, used to travel much with the blacks, yet, without doubt, the results
were most discouraging. After four years, the support accorded the missionaries by
the Presbyterians was withdrawn, and, although at times during that four years they
were kept very short of the barest necessities in life (for about six months they lived
on maize ground into meal, and used as coffee), still the withdrawal of the help
compelled them to turn their attention to farming, to enable them to support their
families growing up around them.
Mr Rode’s great experience in bush life with the blacks assisted him, and
made him the pioneer in opening up the country, and many of the old residents have
enjoyed a nightly rest, and have received that hospitality which his house at German
station was noted for. He took the first white people to Sandgate. Among the first
were Robert Cnbb Richardson, first manager of the Bank of New South Wales
in Brisbane, Louden and James Gibbon. Mr. Rodd took a great interest in politics,
and as a scrutineer with Mr. Robert Cribb, helped in the return of Dr. Lang by a
majority of one vote over Arthur Hobson, to the Parliament of New South Wales
At this time one member represented Moreton Bay. Mr. Rode has always been a
consistent supporter of the Liberal party, and has ever believed that Queensland was
made for the future home of farmers from Great Britain and Europe. His experience

of now about fifty years enables him to say that no greater field is open to an
emigrant than Queensland.
He was made a Justice of the Peace some years ago, and a member of the first
Divisional Board in his district, from which he retired through failing health. Mr.
Bode, who is at this date alive and well, retains the good will, wishes, and respect of
all who know him. He has raised a family of ten children, most of whom are
married and with children and grandchildren. His name will remain fresh in the
memory of the colony of Queensland during the coming century. His wife, the
partner of his toils and joys, passed away in October, 1884, at the close of a
faithful life.
Of the twelve missionaries, five are still living in Queensland, and one in
South Australia, and it is intended to commemorate the jubilee of the arrival on the
25th January, 1888.

J. R BAXTER BRUCE.
41H 151, was i* l London, England, in February, 1851. He is
Mil °f Scotch lineage, both of his parents being from the land of the patriot
Bruce. In 1853, Mr. Bruce removed to Edinburgh, where he received
an excellent education at the public schools of that ancient seat of learning,
subsequently attending the Edinburgh University. He then served articles with
Tawse and Bonar, writers to the Signet, under whose direction he acquired a thorough
knowledge of the law. Not content with the profession, he accepted a position with
the Scottish Widows Fund Insurance Company, with whom he remained for several
years. In 1884, attracted by the glowing accounts of the prosperity of the
Australasian colonies, he proceeded to New Zealand, and subsequently crossed over to
Queensland. In the latter colony he was in December, 1885, admitted as a solicitor.
1 or some time he practised his profession in various northern goldfields, but owing to the
growing prosperity and importance of the capital he determined to locate in Brisbane,
to which city he removed. Some three years since he formed a partnership, the style
of the firm being Chambers, Bruce and McNab. The firm immediately took rank as
one of the leading offices in Brisbane, and now boasts an extensive clientage, which
is constantly increasing. Mr. Bruce is by nature gifted with an excellent command
of language; he is a cogent reasoner, and possessing, as he does, a thorough knowledge
of the law, coupled with extensive colonial experience, his services are sought for by
those who require their business transacted by well-tried and reliable advocates.
Since his settlement in Queensland the subject of this sketch has become thoroughly
imbued with the opinion that the great colony of the north is destined to become, at
no very distant day, the leading factor in Australian national life. With her material,
social and intellectual development, Mr. Bruce is closely identified.


SIR ARTHUR BLYTH,
AGENT-GENERAL FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
ARTHUR BLYTH was born on March 21, 1823, and received his
< §P|i| education at the King Edward YI. Grammar School, Birmingham, under
'filif Dr. Jeune (late Bishop of Peterborough), and Ur. J. P. Lee (late Bishop of
Manchester). Mr. Blyth arrived in South Australia by the “ Ariadne” in 1839, and
settled, with his parents, in Adelaide. Up to 1865 he was actively engaged in trade
pursuits, and also devoted a considerable portion of his time to public affairs. In
1854-5 he was captain of the Volunteers in the force formed during the Russian war,
and has occupied the position of Chairman of the Mitcham District Council, and
assessor of the City Corporation. He was also a member of the Central Road
Board, and of the Chamber of Commerce. As a magistrate Sir Arthur was regarded
with the utmost respect, since he paid the greatest attention to his duties. While
member for Yatala, by which district he was elected in 1855, Sir Arthur was one of
the framers of the Constitution of the colony. This district having on the inauguration
of the new system of two branches of the Legislature been, in 1857, divided into two
parts, he was chosen as one of the members for Gumeracha, which he represented,
with the exception of a brief interval between 1868-9, until the general election of
1875, when he was returned by the electors of North Adelaide. In 1868 he visited
England, returning to the colony and Parliamentary duties in the following year. At
different periods he held the offices of Chief Secretary, Treasurer, Commissioner of
Public Works, and Commissioner of Crown Lands. He was at all times a staunch
supporter of the principles of the Real Property Act, and one of the original counsellors
of Sir R. R. Torrens when that measure was introduced. He was a member of the
Synod of the Church of England, and a Governor of St. Peter s Collegiate School, and
held a Directorship in the South Australian Gas Company and the National Bank.
Having been appointed Agent-General, on February 23rd a complimentary
luncheon was given to him on the occasion of his departure for England, by a number
of his friends and acquaintances, when Sir Henry Ayers, the Chief Secretary, occupied
the chair, and was supported on his right by the Acting-Governor (Mr. Chief Justice
Way), and on his left by the guest of the evening.
On the following day, Saturday, 24th February, 1877, Sir Arthur, accompanied
bv Mrs Blyth and Miss Blyth, sailed in the R.M.S. “ Tanjore” for London, where he
has discharged the duties of a diplomatist most successfully, and the amenities of life
most agreeably, extending to every South Australian and colonists m genera Ins
well-known hospitality.


BENJAMIN HEPBURN.
&IHHERE are men to be met with, who, b> virtue of the mould in which they
are cast, and apart from the happy surroundings of which they arc
inheritors from their birth, achieve distinction. Amongst the number of
such men may be classed the subject of this sketch, Mr. Benjamin Hepburn, the
fourth son of the late Captain Thomas Hepburn. He was born at White Kirk,
Haddington, East Lothian, in 1827, and, after the completion of his studies, worked
on his father’s farm, where he acquired a practical knowledge of agriculture, deeming
it essential to know as much as possible of all matters incidental to a farmer’s
occupation. After some time he was inducted into the mysteries of the miller’s art,
and obtained a thorough knowledge of this business and mill work in general. In
1848 he was attracted to Australia, where his eldest brother, Captain Hepburn, had
taken up his resting place. Mr. Hepburn took ship in the “ Senator,” which arrived
in Adelaide in due time, but deciding not to remain there, he came on to Melbourne.
Immediately on reaching the Port Phillip Settlement, he, in company with Mr. E. T.
Parker, the Black Protector, started for Smeaton sheep station, where his brother
resided. After four years of station life he determined on turning gold miner, and
formed one of a party to try Fryer’s Creek. Gold was soon found, but owing to the
drinking habits of his comrades, he left the diggings and returned home. His next
venture was travelling live stock for sale throughout the various diggings, and
purchasing gold with the proceeds. After a time he leased from his brother the
Glendonald Station, near Creswick, and started on his own account. At Creswick he
erected abattoirs, and afterwards purchased Forest Hill Farm, which he occupied
for two years, and then let on lease to another farmer. Proceeding to Ballarat, Mr.
Hepburn bought the Turf Hotel, with ten acres of land. His advent to Ballarat was
marked by thorough business push and ability. He was the first auctioneer, and
erected the first stock sale yard in the Ballarat district, for which, when the
Corporation started yards of their own, he was paid T7OO to close.
He also started the horse sales, which are one of the features of the Ballarat
sights, and now held at the rear of the Club Hotel, which, in addition to other
properties in the district, belongs to him. He has lately opened up a mine in Green’s
Paddock —the reef extending along Drummond-street. Mr. Hepburn is a keen
sportsman, and was the first to import greyhounds and start coursing in Victoria—
his present kennel, which is a large one, being at the Corporation Cattle and Sheep
Yards. Mr. Hepburn takes a lively interest in the Orphan Asylum, and the children
have reason to be grateful to him for his kindness. In other charitable institutions
he is a real helper, aiding in a monetary sense, his age precluding him from assisting
actively. Having been brought up a Presbyterian, he has subscribed largely to the
funds of that body, and on one occasion gave TlOO towards the erection of St.
Andrew’s spire in Sturt-street. In concluding this brief epitome, we may add that
his name still lives, for though having retired from business, it exists in trading in
the firm of Hepburn and Crawford.


THOMAS M'LEOD PALMER.
M‘LEOD PALMER was born in London, June 21st, 1831. His
mm f was an officer in the service of the East India Company, and being
°f an adventurous spirit he sailed for Tasmania in 1838, in the good ship
“ Barke Madra,” of 450 tons burden, bringing with him his ten young children. The
voyage occupied six months, Launceston being reached in November, 1838. At
Launceston the subject of this sketch received his education, attending the Grammar
School, which at that date was conducted by the Rev. Henry Plow Kane. After the
completion of his studies he served two years in a merchant’s office, namely, that of
Messrs. Marriott, Byass and Co., Launceston. In February, 1850, he was attracted
to the Californian goldfields, and displaying the same spirit which had been evinced
by his father, he sailed for the Golden State in a small brig of 118 tons burden.
In 1854, he returned to Sydney, arriving there on the 22nd day of May of
that year. After spending two days in quarantine, and a short time in the city, he
proceeded overland to the Ovens, Victoria, where his brother was located. He formed
a partnership with his brother at the station, Dederang (now a township), and after
10 years, through cattle disease and low prices of stock, the station was sold, and he
removed to Grassmere, the original station of Mr. Thomas Manifold. Mr. Palmer
was one of the first to try sheep-farming in the immediate vicinity of Warrnambool,
which proved successful. After nine years’ residence he purchased his present place,
“ Tooram,” which in the native language signifies “ stones,” the name being derived
from a slight fall in the river near the house. The position is a very attractive one,
the river flowing within sixty feet of the homestead, while the surrounding scenery
is charming. Some years since Mr. Palmer was elected a member of the Warrnambool
Shire Council. At that time the debt upon the shire amounted to some <£19,000.
His efforts to remove the burden were highly successful, and after three years he was
by a unanimous vote chosen President, filling the office for three years in succession.
During this period he made the most of his opportunities to advance the best interests
of the shire, and such was his success, that at the termination of his term of office he
had the proud satisfaction of seeing the debt paid in full. Local improvements had
also been pushed forward, and the roads very materially improved. In 1873 he was
appointed one of a deputation to wait upon the Premier, the Hon. J. G. Francis, to
present the claims of Warrnambool in behalf of the construction of a breakwater ; the
deputation consisting of the late Major Cramer, Mayor of Warrnambool; the late
Andrew Kerr, Town Engineer; the late Samuel Parke, Shire Engineer; and Mr.
Palmer. About the year 1872, the Warrnambool Club was established, and Mr.
Palmer was elected its first President, and has up to the present time been a member
of the Committee,


BENJAMIN HARRIS BABBIDGE.
SIB™ subject of this sketch is a typical specimen of those sturdy Saxon
Englishmen, whose indomitable pluck has done so much towards the
material prosperity of that Great Britain at home, and Greater Britain
beyond her shores. Mr. Babbidge was born of humble parents at Newport, Isle of
Wight, in 1834. At an early age he was compelled to struggle through and contend
with many difficulties. He consequently had to content himself with a limited
education. This, however, has not deterred him from manfully facing the battle
of life, and fighting through many obstacles to the eminent position which he now
holds in the colony.
His success has been due in a great measure to the fact that he never was
afraid of genuine hard work. At an early age he was apprenticed as a blacksmith
to White, the well-known shipbuilder at Cowes. After completing his engagement
he married, and forthwith determined to try his fortune in Australia, and landed at
Moreton Bay in January, 1857. Immediately he engaged himself to Mr. John Petrie
for six shillings pei day. Subsequently he went to Sydney and visited several parts
of New South Wales, settling down at Newcastle, where he commenced business for
himself.
Finally he returned to Brisbane, where he has resided ever since. He was
engaged by Mr. H. E. Love, a leading contractor of Brisbane at that time. He then
commenced business for himself, first on the site where Shaw and Co.’s ironmongery
stands, on Queen.street. Business rapidly increasing, he purchased a suitable piece
of land in Hope-street, South Brisbane, and erected the beginning of his present
establishment, where for some years the manufacture of railway and other rolling
stock has been largely and ever increasingly carried on. It was decided by Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith, the late Premier, to ask for tenders for rolling stock, for the
purpose of encouraging native industries. Mr. Babbidge determined that at least
one tender should be sent in from Brisbane. He extended his premises and
re-arranged his establishment to enable him to compete for that class of work. His
efforts were rewarded, as he was successful, and up to the present date the quality
of the material turned out, and the despatch with which it has been completed, have
been unsurpassed by any similar manufactory in Australasia. Up to the time when
he turned over his rolling-stock works to his sons, the factory had an output of
.=£20,000 per annum.

Mr. Babbidge also commencedtbe manufacture of agricultural implements, and
secured the first prize for his ploughs at the Exhibition of the National Association.
For some years Mr. Babbidge has been an active and energetic public man.
In 1878 he was elected an alderman for the North Ward, which position he held with
credit until his removal from the city and retirement into private life. He was
elected Mayor of the City of Brisbane in 1885, and President of the United Traffic
Boards in 1886. In each office he was instrumental in effecting some much-needed
reforms, which have since been acknowledged as salutary in their nature.
In politics Mr. Babbidge is a staunch Liberal, but, like many others, he by
no means fully endorsed the conclusions arrived at by Sir Samuel Griffiths and some
of his supporters in Parliament. The fact should not be overlooked that some years
since Mr. Babbidge and other gentlemen originated and floated the Tribune, a journal
which for some time did loyal service in the people’s cause. The paper is now merged
in the Southern World.
Mr. Babbidge is entitled to the honour of being the father of the Protection
movement in Queensland. For many years, in season and out of season, in the face of
bitter opposition and even ridicule, he advocated a Protection Tariff as best calculated to
originate, foster, and place upon a substantial basis the struggling industries of
Queensland.
Upon several occasions large and influential deputations have waited upon
Mr. Babbidge for the purpose of inducing him to consent to become a candidate for a
seat in the Legislature, but which he was compelled to decline in consequence
of ill health.

THE HON. CHARLES MANN, Q.O,
CEOWN SOLICITOR, SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
HON. CHARLES MANN is the eldest son of the late Charles Mann,
who was ie Advocate-General of South Australia, and afterwards
Commissioner of Insolvency and Acting Judge of the Supreme Court.
The subject of this notice was born in Adelaide on the Bth of April, 1838. He was
educated at St. Peter’s College, and, after a brilliant scholastic career, continued his
studies for the legal profession, and was called to the bar when only 22 years of age,
in June, 1860. At about the same time he entered into partnership with the late
Mr. H. W. Parker, and afterwards with Mr. W, C. Belt. He rose rapidly in his
profession, and on terminating his partnership with Mr. Belt he was joined by Mr.
W. H. (now Mr. Justice) Bundey, the firm being known as Mann and Bundey.
He was now already regarded as one of the most reliable counsel and ablest advocates
at the bar, and his services were generally retained in important cases.
In 1870 his superabundant energy and natural ability found further scope for
development in a political career, in which he was destined to be as singularly
successful as he had already been in his own profession. He offered his services to
the electorate of the Burra, and, although there were no less than nine candidates,
including the two previous members for the district—one the present Mr. Justice
Boucaut, and the other the Hon. J. B. Neales—he was elected at the first time of
asking, having as his colleague the late Hon. John Hart, C.M.G., who was shortly
afterwards Premier of the colony. Mr. Mann at once made his mark in the new
arena he had chosen. On the very day the members of the newly elected House
were sworn in, he had decidedly the best of a warm brush with the Hon. H. B. J.
Strangways, the then Premier, and before the session was far advanced his power
was so fully recognised that he was accepted as the leader of the Opposition to the
Hart Ministry, which had been formed on the defeat of Mr. Strangways on the first
day of the session. On the 6th of October of the same year, Mr. Mann, as leader of
the Opposition, moved a direct vote of “dissatisfaction” as to the action of the
Ministry with reference to the Port Augusta railway, and was only defeated by a
majority of one vote. In the recess which ensued, the Ministry was reconstructed,
and in July, 1871, Mr. Mann was sworn in as Attorney-General, only a few days
more than a year from his first election to Parliament. Later in the same year a


Ministerial crisis occurred, but, on the 10th November, Mr. Mann again accepted
the Attorney-Generalship in the Ministry then formed by Mr. (now Sir Arthur)
Blyth. He again became Attorney-General in the Blyth Ministry formed on the
22nd July, 1873, and retained the position until June 3rd, 1875. On the 23rd June,
in the same year, he was gazetted Queen’s Counsel, and is thus the senior Q.C.
practising at the South Australian bar, the only others being Sir John Downer,
gazetted May 22, 1878, and Mr. J. H. Symon, June 1, 1881. In March, 1876, the
Ministry, which, under the lead of the present Mr. Justice Boucaut, had awakened
the enthusiasm of the colonists by the celebrated “ broad and comprehensive ” policy
it had announced, was reconstructed owing to the elevation of its Attorney-General
to the Chief Justiceship, and Mr. Mann was again offered and accepted his old
position. The reconstructed Ministry, however, resigned after the meeting of
Parliament in the following June, and Mr. Mann was out of office until October,
1878, when he again joined Mr. Boucaut as Attorney-General. On Mr. Boucaut’s
elevuuon to the Bench shortly afterwards, his Ministry was reconstructed under the
late Sir William Morgan, and Mr. Mann became Treasurer of the Province, and
leader of the House of Assembly, which distinguished position he retained until
the 10th of March, 1881, when he was appointed Crown Solicitor, the office he still
holds, in succession to the late Mr. Justice Andrews, who was then raised to the
Bench of the Supreme Court.
In accepting the Crown Solicitorship, Mr. Mann necessarily abandoned his
political career, and he did not offer himself for re-election at the general elections
which followed. Since his first election for the Burra in 1870, he had continuously
represented the adjoining district of Stanley, the two having been formerly united as
one constituency. He was never defeated in any contest, and the eleven years of his
Parliamentary life were marked by almost phenomenal advancement and success.
When he accepted the Treasurership and the responsibility of leading the House of
Assembly in 1878, some doubts were expressed as to the result of what was regarded
by some as the risky experiment of a gentleman trained to the legal profession
venturing to elucidate and control the mysteries of national finance. These doubts
were, however, soon set at rest. Mr. Mann at once demonstrated, what has always
since been conceded, that he possessed exceptional aptitude for leadership ; and his
first Budget speech, while being remarkably lucid as an exposition of the financial
position of the country, has never been excelled for the genuine eloquence with which
he appealed to the patriotism of the Parliament to support the policy he had indicated
to the House.
Mr. Mann also twice acted on Intercolonial Conferences in Sydney, once in
1880, when the colony entered into a renewal of the River Murray Convention with
New South Wales, in relation to which certain amendments of the Tariff were
essential, and were agreed to in a special session, lasting only three days, the shortest
on record ; and again in conjunction with Sir William Morgan in 1881, when he
drafted resolutions for the establishment and maintenance of an Australasian fleet, on

lines similar to those recently adopted by the Imperial Conference. No one would
now dispute the fact that amongst the many able and eminent men who have sat
in the South Australian Parliament, Mr. Mann ranks amongst the very foremost.
It only remains to add that, although Crown Solicitor, Mr. Mann enjoys a
large private practice, which in itself evidences his leading position in his profession;
and in prosecuting for the Crown, his addresses to juries might almost be accepted as
the impartial exposition of the judge. On the death of Mr. Justice Andrews, whom
he had succeeded as Crown Solictor, Mr. Mann was the first to whom the vacant
judgeship was offered, but he declined the position. It may also be said that in
addition to the high reputation and many distinctions Mr. Mann has acquired, both
in his profession and in Parliament, few men have ever gained greater personal
popularity in private and social circles. He is one of the prominent native-born
South Australians whom South Australians most delight to honour.
THE HON. CHAKLES MANN, Q.C.


HON. SIMON FRASER, M.L.C.
subject of this sketch is the youngest son of William Fraser, of Nova
IW Scotia, Dominion of Canada, the latter having emigrated from Inverness,
Scotland, shortly after the capitulation of the French, consequent upon
the capture of Quebec by the British Commander, Wolfe. The Hon. Simon Fraser
was born at Pictou, Nova Scotia, in 1834, receiving his education at the East River
Seminary. At the early age of eighteen he emigrated to Victoria, and began his
career south of the line on the Bendigo goldfields. In 1855 he commenced business
at Melbourne in a small store off Elizabeth-street, where he traded in produce from
Sydney. Being desirous of enlarging his sphere of action, he entered into contracts
with the Government for the construction of bridges, piers, &c., and after spending
some years in this employment, he became one of the promoters and members of
the firm of Collier, Barry and Co., who built the Echuca Railway, between Sandhurst
and the River Murray. At a later period, between 1875 and 1880, he, in conjunction
with Messrs. Barry and Brookes, built the South Australian line of railway from
Port Augusta to Farina —a distance of two hundred miles. In 1865 he purchased
a Queensland station, of which he still remains part owner. A three years’
residence in the great northern colony sufficed, and he returned to Melbourne to
become a permanent resident. One of Mr. Hugh Glass’ stations at Echuca being
thrown on the market by the bank, it was purchased by Mr. Fraser and two other
gentlemen. As a politician, Mr. Fraser justly ranks as possessing views of a
moderate and liberal character, favoring a land, property, and income tax. In 1874,
he successfully contested Rodney in the interest of the Francis Ministry, and
represented that constituency for about nine years. Being desirous of re-visiting his
native land, he retired from Parliamentary life at the general election of 1883, and
spent two years in travelling throughout America and Europe. He returned to
Australia early in 1885, fully convinced that Victoria offers greater inducements to the
laboring man and artisan than any country which he had visited in his journey
around the world. In 1885, he contested West Melbourne for a seat in the Legislative
Assembly, his opponent being Mr. G. D. Carter, the then mayor of the city, the latter
being successful. Mr. Fraser also suffered a defeat in the Northern Province in April,
1886, but was returned as a member of the Legislative Council for the South
Yarra Province in August of the same year. As a director and shareholder ol the
private railway between Deniliquin and Moama, N.S.W. (of which he was one of the
firm of contractors), he continues to hold an interest in the mother colony. Mr.
Fraser was Chairman of the Australian Widows’ Life Assurance Society for years,
and, prior to his European trip, one of the Directors of the City ol Melbourne Bank.


REV. JOHN GARLTCK
v ; Y||||HE KEY. JOHN GARLICK is the eldest son of the Rev. T. B. Garlick,
Sup er anni ia ted Clergyman in the diocese of Melbourne. He was born at
Adelaide, South Australia, in 1844. When an infant, his father removed
to Tasmania, becoming one of the chaplains employed by the Government. His
early boyhood was spent at Launceston, Hobart, Port Arthur, and in the Lake River
district. Early in 1856 he removed to Melbourne, and resided with his father at
Williamstown, St James’ Parsonage, Melbourne, and Benalla. Subsequently, he
spent two years as a member of a surveying party in the Ovens district. Proceeding
with his education at the Church of England Grammar School, he matriculated at the
Melbourne University, where he attended lectures in the Arts course for one year.
He became a tutor in a Grammar School at Kyneton, and studied under the guidance
of the Rev. Canon Vance, B.D. At Moore College, New South AVales, he spent 1868-9,
and was ordained a deacon by Bishop Perry at Melbourne in 1869, and priest in
1870. He was appointed officiating minister at Bacchus Marsh and district on June
Ist, 1869. On May Ist, 1872, he became an incumbent of Echuca, and on July Ist,
1877, received his appointment as Rural Bean of that place. Obtaining twelve
months’ leave of absence, from January Ist to December 31st, 1878, he officiated as
locum tenens to the Rev. Canon Goodman, of Geelong, during that gentleman’s visit to
England. On April Bth, 1883, he was licensed to the incumbency of All Saints,
Sandhurst, and appointed Rural Dean of Sandhurst, vice Canon MacCullagh, who was
made Archdeacon in June, 1883.
Dean Garlick has devoted most of his leisure hours to literary and scientific
pursuits, being a contributor to newspapers, reviews, and magazines. His scientific
conclusions have been made public through the medium of lectures, two of which
have been delivered under the auspices of the School of Mines, Sandhurst, being
entitled “ Scientific Research and its Manifold Avenues,” 1885, and “ The Rise, Growth
and Scope of Periodical Literature,” 1887. Both were very favourably noticed by the
press. His special sermons stamp him as a profound and original thinker, one
delivered at the request of Bishop Moorhouse, an Ordination sermon at St. Peters’,
Melbourne, in Advent, 1882, being exceptionally cogent, logical, and eloquent. As
one of the founders of the Echuca Mechanics’ Institute and Free Library, he was
made a life member, as also of the Asylum for the Blind, Melbourne.
In 1869, he married the only daughter of the Rev. A. M. Ramsay, of
Melbourne, and sister to the late Hon. Robert Ramsay, who died in 1874, the issue
being two children. In 1878, he married the relict of the late Dr. Gummow, of
Swan Hill and Echuca, coroner.




Fergus son & Mitchell. Li th.
Judge T.S.Cope,


THOMAS SPENCER COPE.
«HOMAS SPENCER COPE was born in London, April 19th, 1821, and
mm educated at the University of London, where he took the degree of LL.B.
He studied for the Bar in the chambers of the eminent pleader, Mr.
Thomas Chitty, and was called to the Bar by the Hon. Society of the Middle Temple,
November 22nd, 1845. For several years he acted as reporter for the Law Times ,
in the Court of Exchequer, and at Nisi Trim for the Times and Daily News. He
arrived in Victoria in April, 1853, where he immediately entered upon the successful
practice of his profession. After the passage of the New Constitution Act, he was
solicited to represent Ballarat, but declined in consequence of his increased practice.
Judge Cope is an advanced Liberal in politics; he is in favour of the abolition of
the action of debt, also holding that the penal code is too severe, and a relic of the
feudal ages.
Mr. Cope was one of the first inhabitants of Emerald Hill, then a part of
Melbourne, and, together with the present Chief Justice Higmbotham, the late Sir
John O’Shanassy, the late Hon. R. H. Anderson, the Hon. James Service, and
others, took an active part in securing the separation of that model town from the
City of Melbourne. Emerald Hill was the first town that threw off the yoke, and
emancipated itself from the city, and from that date it has prospered and flourished.
During the stormy days of the Ballarat troubles the rioters commanded the sympathy
of Mr. Cope, who was one of the counsel engaged in defending them upon the charge
of treason. He attended a meeting held opposite what was then St. Paul’s Church,
now the site of the Cathedral, where he stated that he was sure the Bar and the
attorneys would defend the prisoners without fee or reward.
In 1856, Mr. Cope was appointed Deputy Judge and Chairman of General
Sessions for the Ballarat District, in place of the late Air. Wrixon ; and, finally, in
1858, was permanently appointed as Judge of the Court of Mines, Judge of the
County Court and Chairman of General Sessions for the District of Beechworfch, where
he remained for ten years, and took an active part in all the local societies. He was
then removed to Melbourne, where he now is the Senior County Court Judge. During
the absence of the late Chief Justice in 1885, he was appointed acting Judge of the
Supreme Court, from August until June, 1886.


HON. SIR SAMUEL WALKER GRIFFITH, M.A., Q.C., K.C.M.G.
Premier and Chief Secretary of Queensland.
i«MI DST ie ricket A P ok tics and rockety statesmanship which is frequently
encountered, it must be as cheering to the bewildered explorer of truth
to mee f with a man of pure conviction, and that experience which tempers
energy, as it is refreshing to the wearied traveller in the desert to catch the first
glimpse of the oasis. The simile may not be inaptly applied to the subject of this
memoir, one of the most prominent of the public men of Australia. Time was when
the politicians and statesmen of this continent were regarded by those in other parts
of the world as mere place-hunters and adventurers, but a more intimate acquaintance
with Australia's really Representative Men has sufficed to dispel that illusion. True
it is that the modes of procedure at times are not quite in harmony with those of
countries more matured by age, and equally true is it that the measures passed by
the several Legislatures may appear subversive of what is considered essential
amongst nations rendered conservative from many circumstances; but it must be
borne in mind that specific cases require specific treatment, and the vigour with
which measures may be attacked and defended are indicative of a health-throbbing
vitality. Australia is still a young country, and perhaps will continue so in another
sense of the word, owing to the fresh blood which is ever infused into her public
men, not only by the advent of rising and self-reliant men to her public councils, not
only by the introduction of new ideas originated by these men, but by the enthusiasm
which fires the patriot to see his country prosper. Such men leave their impress on
the national life of a country, and although, when they have passed the boundary of
time, it matters nought to them of posthumous fame, yet the desire that their good
deeds live after them must urge them to tread the paths of duty, to do the right, and
denounce the wrong. It cannot, however, be said that Sir Samuel need console
himself with such a prospect, for already, and for some time past, has his work as a
politician and statesman received a due and deserved recognition. It is without the
limits of a short biographical sketch to pronounce how or when—the duty of a
biographer being merely that of a chronicler of facts with a due regard for truth.
Sir Samuel was born at Merthyr Tydvil, Wales, on June 21, 1845 ; and as his father,
the Eev. Edward Griffith, a Nonconformist Minister of that town, emigrated in
1853, he was but eight years of age when he reached the shores of Australia.
Coming here in his boyhood and growing up amongst colonial institutions, he is
thoroughly Australian in ideas, sympathy, and genius. His father, immediately
after his arrival, was inducted to the charge of the Congregational Church, Ipswich.


Alter remaining there for some time he removed to Maitland, and afterwards to the
capital city of Queensland, where by his energy, his love, his sympathy and
earnestness, displayed for more than a quarter of a century, he has gained the loving
esteem and respect of one of the most intelligent and largest congregations in
Brisbane. Sir Samuel’s preliminary education was received at the academy of Mr.
R. Harriman, Sydney, from which he passed in 1856 to the High School, West
Maitland, where, under the then head-mastership of the Rev. W. MTntyre, he
received an admirable training, which has, in a large measure, contributed to his
mental superiority. In 1860 he entered the University of Sydney, and there justified
the anticipations of his friends and previous masters. He was a severe student, but
could, nevertheless, enjoy that life which is inseparable from a University, and he
may be cited as one of those few who distinguish themselves alike in Classics and
Mathematics, gaining special scholarships in both subjects, and going out in the B.A.
Examination as a double first in Classics and Mathematics, subsequently in the year
1870 taking his M.A. degree. Sir Samuel’s great college chum was Charles Stuart
Mein, who was elevated in 1885 to the Bench of the Supreme Court of Queensland.
Sir Samuel returned to Queensland in 1863, and having chosen the profession of the
law, became articled to Mr. Macalister, then a leading solicitor in Brisbane, and
subsequently Premier and Agent-General for the Colony in London. In 1865,
while yet an articled clerk, he gained the Mort Travelling Fellowship from Sydney
University; and in fulfilment of the conditions of the foundation, he travelled to
Europe, studying with much profit the institutions of the Old World, and acquiring
a comprehensive view of the various social and political phenomena of life. Having
completed his articles, Sir Samuel did not proceed with the profession of a solicitor,
but in October, 1867, joined the Queensland Bar, and speedily acquired a large
practice as a barrister. Nor is this a source of wonder, since Sir Samuel possesses
all those qualities which ensure pre-eminence in the legal profession—knowledge of
human nature, clearness of perception, facility of discrimination, and readiness of
speech, combined with a perfect acquaintance with the principles of Jurisprudence,
and an intimate familiarity with the Common Law. His faculties—analytical and
synthetical—are equally balanced, and accordingly he could, without faltering or
imperilling his client, present his case forcibly to the Bench. His abilities standing
in no need of the aid of oratory, or the assistance of verbosity, gained for him the
distinction of Queen’s Counsel in the year 1876. Not unlike many advocates of the
bar, Sir Samuel is also recognised as a politician of great worth, and as a statesman
of indisputable foresight—a very essential qualification for those who may be called
upon to take the helm of government. He first entered Parliament in March, 1872,
where he represented in the Legislative Assembly the electorate of East Moreton,
sustaining his previous reputation as a ready and powerful speaker. In that year he
succeeded in bringing to a close the Parliamentary deadlock which had continued for
months. In the same session he introduced and passed the Telegraph Messages
Act, which enables all legal process to be transmitted by telegraph, and which has
been adopted in South Australia. On the dissolution of Parliament in 1873 he was
HON. SIR SAMUEL WALKER GRIFFITH, M.A., Q.C., K.C.M.G.


elected for the newly-created seat of Oxley. In the session of 1874, being still a
private member, he introduced and succeeded in passing the Insolvency Act of 1874,
which is admittedly one of the best laws on the subject in force in Her Majesty’s
dominions. In August of that year he was appointed to the distinguished position of
Attorney-General in the Macalister Administration, and while holding that office
exhibited his accustomed skill in guiding the course of several measures in the
Legislative Assembly, amongst which was the State Education Act of 1875, which
embodies the principles of free, secular, and compulsory education. Upon this Act
coming into operation on Ist January, 1876, Sir Samuel was appointed the first
Secretary for Public Instruction, which office he held for three years, during which the
department was organised on a basis which has proved most satisfactory. In 1876,
Mr. Macalister having retired from the Premiership, Sir Samuel accepted under his
successor, the Hon. George Thorn, his former offices of Attorney-General and
Secretary for Public Instruction, During that year the Judicature Act was adopted,
as well as the Oaths Amendment Act, by which a declaration made in a court of law
should have the same validity as an oath.
In Mr. Douglas’s Administration, formed in February, 1877, on Mr. Thorn’s
retirement, Sir Samuel retained his former offices until the end of 1878, when he
accepted the office of Secretary of Public Works, Mr. J. F. Garrick succeeding him
as Attorney-General. The session of 1878 was signalised by Sir Samuel introducing
and passing a complete measure for Local Government, one of the most valuable
measures to be found on the statute books of the Australian colonies. Then followed
the usual appeal to the electorates, when Sir Samuel, who had by this time got well
to the front as a leading politician, was returned at the head of the poll for the
metropolitan constituency, the Hon. A. H. (now Sir Arthur) Palmer being second.
On the meeting of the new Parliament in January, 1879, the Douglas Administration
resigned, having been defeated by thirty-two votes to twenty on a vote of want of
confidence moved by Mr. (now Sir Thomas) MTlwraith. Sir Samuel was then
chosen as leader of the Opposition. During his leadership of the Liberal minority
for the space of nearly five years he exercised the utmost vigilance in the interests
of the colony, omitting no opportunity of detecting and exposing every weak point in
the Government’s armour, as well as striving earnestly to, as Mr. Gladstone puts it)
“ elevate parliamentary manners,” so that the stigma of faction might not attach to
the Assembly.
Sir Samuel Griffith proceeded to England at his own expense to be present
at a meeting of a Commission appointed to enquire into certain alleged irregularities
in connection with contracts for the purchase of steel rails for the Government of
Queensland. The facts elicited, however, exonerated the persons said to be
implicated. In 1882 and 1883 Sir Samuel buckled on all his armour to defeat two
schemes formulated and developed by the MTlwraith Administration —one the
Trans-Continental Land-Grant Railway, the other a proposal to introduce coolie
labour from British India for the sugar plantations of Northern Queensland. So
powerfully did he oppose these plans that he caused the House to hesitate, and the
HON. SIR SAMUEL WALKER GRIFFITH, M.A., Q.C., K.C.M.G.


country to reject them. Nothing remained for Sir Thomas but to appeal to the
constituencies, with the result that the decision was against him. Sir Thomas, being
defeated on some preliminary motions, resigned without waiting for the discussion of
the Governor’s speech; whereupon Sir Samuel, who had been re-elected for North
Brisbane by an immense majority, was, in November, 1883, called on to form a
Ministry. This he did, undertaking himself the arduous offices of Premier,
Colonial Secretary, and Secretary lor Public Instruction. At the convention of
lepiesentatives ol the Australasian Colonies, held at Sydney in December, 1883,
Sir Samuel was one of the representatives of Queensland, when he gave still further
evidence ol his powers by the practical manner in which he handled the important
subjects considered by the Convention. The resolutions which were adopted by the
Convention were, to a large extent, drafted by him, and it is understood that the
Federal Council Bill was mainly the work of his hand.
Agitation is at present proceeding for separation of the north part of
Queensland, which is generally believed to be the outcome of the labour difficulty,
although it may be that other causes have given a fillip to the movement. Besides the
many beneficial measures introduced and passed during Sir Samuel’s administration
there are several having reference to the domestic policy of the colony—all the
Defence Act, an admirable measure, making adequate provision for raising a
disciplined force for the defence of the colony ; the Health Act; the Licensing Act,
which embodied a complete system of local option ; and the Loan Act of 1884, which
authorises the construction of a comprehensive system of public works in all parts of
the colony.
The Russian scare of 1885 created an amount of fuss and bungling in at least
one of the colonies, which was happily unknown in Queensland, as the provisions of
the Defence Act then recently passed enabled the necessary steps for the protection
of the colony from foreign invasion to be taken quickly and effectively. The land
in almost every country is more or less a source of trouble and anxiety to legislators.
The Land Act introduced and passed by Sir Samuel’s Government in 1884—laid
down on the lines of preserving the public estate to the community, of encouraging
the Crown tenants to improve their holdings, of securing an adequate return to the
State from its land, and of facilitating to the greatest extent bond fide settlement, and
discouraging the mere speculative acquisition of land—answered all requirements.
In 1885, Sir Samuel resigned the Secretaryship for Public Instruction,
retaining the offices of Premier and Colonial Secretary. In 1880, he resigned the
latter office, assuming the newly-created office of Chief Secretary, to which
comparatively little departmental work is attached. At the meeting of the
Federal Council of Australasia, which began its sittings in Hobart on January 25,
1886, Sir Samuel proposed and Mr. Douglas seconded Mr. Service for the position
of President. At this council Sir Samuel took a prominent part. In moving the
adoption of the address in reply to Sir George Strachan’s opening speech he said,
“ There were no more loyal subjects than the members of the Federal Council; and
instead of weakening the empire, the union of the colonies was more likely to tend to
HON. SIE SAMUEL WALKEE GEIFFITH, M.A., Q.C., K.C.M.G.


the maintenance and consolidation of the empire ; because Australasia, being united,
would be listened to when it spoke through the Federal Council.” He pointed out
the necessity of proceeding carefully, and doing nothing that might have a deterrent
effect on the colonies that were standing aloof from joining the union. He touched
briefly on the recidivistc question by advocating a policy of vigilance.
Alluding to the Queensland separation movement, he said that there should be
a general expression of public opinion upon the labour question throughout
Australasia; and he considered it very undesirable that New Guinea should be
annexed to Queensland, although he had offered on behalf of Queensland to undertake
the supervision of its government. At the close of the sitting of the Federal Council,
Sir Samuel was appointed chairman of the Standing Committee of the council.
Amongst parliamentary orators, Sir Samuel would rank with the late Mr. Roebuck of
the House of Commons, who always spoke from the heart, being first an Englishman
and then a party man. Substituting colonist for Englishman, we have a definition of
Sir Samuel as a patriotic legislator, who at times has electrified the House by
speeches remarkable for close reasoning and lucid illustration. His manner is
unconstrained and devoid of the adventitious aid of affectation, which so many
employ to hide their defects. His utterance is quiet, and his enunciation rapid and
clear ; at all times he has control of his voice, modulating it at will, and causing it
to act with the promptitude of a slave who carries out the commands of his master.
He is acknowledged to be a parliamentary tactician of the first rank, and his skill in
carrying measures in the face of determined opposition has won for him the
admiration, not only of his followers, but of his opponents. His administrative
capabilities are admitted to be unsurpassable, for he can not only generalise but
particularise, sifting to the bottom every detail, nothing escaping his attention. It
is said of Prince Bismarck by those who have had the honour of his society, that he
is all business in his office and all geniality in his house. The simile may fittingly
and respectfully be applied to the gentleman whose merits have been so thoroughly
appreciated that it pleased Her Gracious Majesty, in July, 1886, to create him
K.C.M.G.
In 1870, Sir Samuel married Julia Janet, third daughter of James Thomson,
Esq., of Maitland, New South Wales. True to his traditions as a Welshman, he
embalms his birthplace by naming his residence at Brisbane “Merthyr.” In
concluding this memoir, it may be remarked that the name of Griffith is one of the
most ancient in the Principality appearing throughout Welsh History. One of them
was the last King of Wales.
[Since the foregoing sketch was written, a general election has taken place, and has resulted in a
victory for Sir Thomas MTlwraith as the leader of a new party, called the National Party ; and which
it is safe to predict will result in Sir Samuel giving up the reins of Government in favor of his opponent,
on the assembly of the new Parliament, in June, 1888.]

HON. HENRY EDWARD KING.
King * s 1G e^es t son °f Captain John W. King, of the Fifth
ifj|ij Northumberland Fusiliers, and was born June 0, 1832. He received his
education at the College School, Gloucester, and passed his examination
at Sandhurst in 1850, and was gazetted as second lieutenant in the sth Fusiliers in
March of that year. In May he was transferred to the 27th Enniskillins as ensign,
and joined them at Belfast. He retired from the service by sale of his commission
in March, 1852, and sailed for Australia, landing in Sydney in July. His first venture
was a visit to the goldfields, where he worked various claims for some time. In
January, 1853, he proceeded to the Ovens, and for a time worked on the
Yackandandah Creek, but without success. He next determined to try his fortune in
the country north of Moreton Bay. In July, 1853, he landed in Brisbane, and for
some months acquired colonial experience upon a station. In 1854 he went out
with Win. Archer, Esq., upon an expedition, sent with supplies through the unoccupied
district of Port Curtis, to meet the Government survey party which had been dispatched
from Sydney to lay out a township. In 1858, Mr. King married, and purchased a
new station just formed on the Dawson. In 1860, he sold the station and removed
to Rockhampton. As leader of a prospecting party he visited the Port Curtis ranges,
where he discovered a little gold and copper mine, which was worked for a short time
and abandoned. In 1862 Mr. King was appointed Government Surveyor and
Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Mitchell district, and he surveyed the first
runs taken up on the Barcoo and Thompson Rivers. In 1864 he was transferred to
the Leichhardt district, and in 1865 he was sent to the Gympie as the first gold
commissioner there. In May, 1870, he resigned the commissionership, and was
elected to represent Wide Bay in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. In
1871, Parliament being dissolved, he contested the seat for Maryborough with the
Hon. W. H. Walsh, Minister for Works, but was defeated by 16 votes. Subsequently
he was re-elected by his old constituency, Wide Bay. On the dissolution of
Parliament at the end of 1873, he did not come forward as a candidate,
hut in 1874 accepted office as Minister of Works, and was elected for Ravens wood.
In May, 1876, he resigned his portfolio, in consequence of a difference with his
colleagues respecting the policy of railway extension, and in July of the same year
he was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. At the general election of 1878
he was returned for Maryborough, and again chosen as Speaker. In 1883 he was
defeated at the general election, and has since that time remained out ot Parliament.


In 188G Mr. King was admitted as a barrister of the Supreme Court in Queensland.
In politics Mr. King has always been a Liberal. He was a firm supporter of Mr.
Lillie (now Sir Charles Lillie) during the long contest which the Liberals waged under
Mr. Lillie against the squatting party under Sir Arthur Palmer. From his first entry
into public life Mr. King has been a staunch champion of the mining industry. In
his first session he introduced and passed the Goldfields’ Homestead Act, which has
proved of great service, and is still in force, with amendments. It was through his
instrumentality that the duty on gold was removed, and he was a member of the
Cabinet by which the State Education Act was passed. Mr. King was the first to
advocate the construction of railways to the goldfields, a project which, at its
inception, met with strong opposition, on the grounds that there would be no return
traffic from the fields. The success of the Gympie and Maryborough lines, however,
demonstrated the absurdity of the argument, and led to the construction of railways
to all of the principal goldfields.
HON. HENRY EDWARD KING.


RICHARD JAMES BARRY,
f </' 9
4^m ICR^lW JAMES BARRY was born in Ballydehob, County Cork, Ireland,
011 January 10, 1840, and was a son of David Barry, a merchant in that
town. He sprang from an old family, which has produced many brilliant
men. His ancestors were Lords of the Pale in the days when the Geraldines were
supreme in Leinster, and the Butlers of Ormond waged war upon the plains of
Ossory. They crossed over from England with those who accompanied Richard
Stronghow, a De Band previous to that having assisted the Conqueror to defeat
Harold. In his younger days, Mr. Barry travelled a good deal, and reached the colony
of Queensland in 1804. For the first year after his arrival, he managed the business
of Messrs. Fisher and Hill, saddlers, Toowoomba, and afterwards entered into
partnership with J. P. O’Connell. At the end of three years the partnership was
dissolved, and he commenced business as a saddler on his own account in Toowoomba.
Being a shrewd and intelligent man, and possessed of more than an average amount
of intelligence, he rapidly amassed a considerable amount of property. Intoxicated
with success, ho over-speculated, and the losses which he sustained were a source of
care to him in the latter years of his life. Anxious for the welfare of the town of
Toowoomba, Mr. Barry, after his establishment in business, was elected Alderman on
February 13, 1867, retaining his seat as such until the retirement, by rotation, of
Aldermen, and for nearly eighteen years performed the multifarious duties of a town
councillor with assiduity and credit, as well as those of a magistrate of the territory,
taking at the same time an active part in Parliamentary politics. In 1874 he defeated
the Hon. W. H. Groom, the present Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly,
by twenty-six votes in the election for councillor.
The volunteer movement had his cordial sympathy and support, and for several
years he was a prominent member of the local force, in which he occupied the rank
of colour-sergeant. For many years Mr. Barry was also President of the Hibernian
Society, and on his retirement, so highly was he esteemed by his fellow-countrymen
that they presented him with an address and a purse of sovereigns.
In 1881 he was struck down with an attack of rheumatism, and up to the time
of his death, in the month of March, 1886, he suffered greatly from that painful
malady. He never regained his former health and vigour, and about six weeks before
his death, a severe cold brought on another attack, to which he succumbed. He was
only forty-six years of age when summoned away, was conscious to the last, and died
fortified by the rites of his church, in which two of his uncles are priests. He was
married in Toowoomba, Queensland, in September 1865, to Miss Alice Murphy,
daughter of Mr. Peter Murphy, a freeholder of that town, by whom he had issue of
six children, all of whom, with his wife, survive him.
We must not omit to mention that Mr. Barry was awarded a certificate of merit
in vellum, together with a medal by the Royal Humane Society, instituted 1774, for
his noble and intrepid conduct, at the early age of thirteen years, in rescuing a child
who had accidentally fallen into the water at Sand Quay, Ballydehob, county Cork,
on the 21st August, 1853.


HON. WILLIAM FREDERICK TAYLOR, M.D., M.L.C.
i subject of this sketch was bom in London, England, April 23rd, 1840,
mm and went to Canada with his parents in 1842. Having received an
excellent primary education, Mr. Taylor attended Queen’s University,
Kingston, Canada, one of the most thoroughly equipped colleges in North America,
where he graduated with honors, obtaining the degree of Doctor of Medicine in April,
1861. Fully alive to the importance, from a scientific and professional point of view,
of the extensive range of subjects only to be found in the great hospitals of Europe,
Dr. Taylor proceeded to England in November, 1862, and became a Licentiate of the
Apothecaries’ Society, London, in December of that year. Receiving an appointment
as surgeon in a ship conveying emigrants to Australia, he sailed in January, 1863,
for Melbourne, and arrived in Hobson’s Bay April Ist. Deciding to locate in Australia,
he proceeded to Hay, New South Wales, where he entered upon the practice of his
profession, which he conducted from May, 1863, to June, 1866. In 1864 he was
appointed a justice of the peace for New South Wales. In July, 1866, Dr. Taylor left
Hay and sailed from Sydney for London, where he arrived in the following October,
Once more entering upon the study of his profession, he entered Guy’s Hospital, and
obtained the diploma of Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, England, in May,
1867. He then proceeded to Paris, where he attended the hospitals from September,
1867, to August, 1868. Returning to England, he took passage on the ship “ Oriental”
as surgeon-in-charge, and arrived in Melbourne, October, 1868. For a time he took
charge of the Beech worth Hospital, and finally commenced practice at Gray town,
Victoria, where he remained for about one year, during which time he was appointed
a justice of the peace for Victoria. In December, 1869, he removed to Eaglehawk,
which place he left for Clermont, Queensland, in April, 1870, where he remained in
practice until October, 1875, during which time he was Surgeon-Superintendent of
the Peak Downs Hospital. He was also appointed a justice of the peace for Queensland
in 1873. In October, 1875, he removed to Warwick, Queensland, and there remained in
practice until Dec., 1881. During nearly the whole of his residence he was one of the
Visiting Medical Officers to the Warwick Hospital. In January, 1882, he removed to
Brisbane, where he was appointed a member of the Medical Board for Queensland.
In April, 1883, he again sailed for England. Subsequently, he made two voyages to
Brisbane, in charge of emigrants, as Surgeon-Superintendent, during 1884.
Returning to England, he remained in the mother country from October, 1834, to
June, 1885, and obtained the Diploma in Public Health of the Royal College of

Physicians, London, in March, 1885, and was also elected a life member of the
Sanitary Institute of Great Britain in the following May. Once more he sailed for
Brisbane as Surgeon-Superintendent of the s.s. “ Dorunda,” arriving in July, 1885.
His services were then secured by the Queensland Government, to prepare a report
upon “Water Supply and Sewerage Disposal,” in which he embodied the latest
scientific conclusions relative to these important questions. Returning to practice in
Brisbane in August, 1885, he has since remained a resident of the capital. He was
appointed a member of the Central Board of Health for Queensland in 1886, and was
called to the Legislative Council for that colony in May, 1886. His world-wide
experiences contributed in a marked degree to render his judgment upon public
questions of great value to the State, while his scientific acquirements, in a young-
colony, upon sanitary questions, can be utilised with great advantage.

HON. GEORGE KING, M.L.C.
£*||QE subject of our sketch was born in Riga, Russia, December 21, 1814,
lIIP his father being a partner in the firm of Balfour and Co., of that city.
% gillie Being intended for a mercantile career, he was sent to London and various
places upon the Continent, where he was educated with a view to his future success.
He arrived in Australia in July, 1839, visited England in 1874, and returned in 1875,
since which date he has been a permanent resident of Queensland. For many years he
was extensively engaged in business in Sydney, but realising that Queensland
possessed unlimited resources, and was destined at no distant date to outstep the
mother colony, he wisely threw in his lot with the enterprising and far-seeing men
who settled in the North. In consequence of his varied experience, practical
knowledge and probity of purpose, Mr. King was appointed Executive Commissioner
for Queensland at the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880. He represented
Queensland on the Royal Commission held in London in 1881, in connection with the
Steel Rails Question, and was called to the Legislative Council in 1882. From an early
date he had taken a leading part in commercial and financial matters, having, when a
resident of Sydney, been a Director of the Australian Trust Company, of the London
Chartered Bank, and of the Commercial Banking Company, Clearly perceiving the
advantages which accrue in connection with a well-conducted Life Assurance Society,
having its head office in Australia, he took a deep interest in the Australian Mutual
Provident Society, and for fifteen years he was chairman of the same. In 1805, he
was appointed Consul for Italy, by King Victor Emanuel, and on his retirement in
1875, was created a Knight of the Crown of Italy, in recognition of his distinguished
services. Few men in Australia have devoted more of their time to advancing the
best interests of the colonies. Mr. King was elected a member of the popular
chamber of the Legislature for East Sydney, in 1869, and represented that
constituency until the dissolution of Parliament. Amongst the numerous
appointments held by Mr. King were the following :—A member of the Board of
Advice of the Australian Agricultural Company, a Director of the Clarence and
Richmond River Steam Navigation Company, and Chairman of the Southern Marine
Insurance Company. With truth it may be said that Mr. King is full of years and
honours in the land of his adoption, and well merits the confidence, respect and
esteem of his fellow colonists.


HON. GEORGE THORN,
4|»IE HON. GEORGE THORN was bom in Sydney, New South Wales,
| JL i October 12, 1838, and when very young removed to Ipswich, Moreton
Bay, now Queensland. His early education was received at the King’s
School, Parramatta, under the able tuition of Mr. Forrest. He then proceeded to the
Sydney University, where he graduated, receiving the degree of Bachelor of Arts.
Naturally inclined to take a deep interest in public affairs, he first became a candidate
lor a seat in the Legislature of Queensland in 1867, when he was returned with Mr.
O’Sullivan and the late Sir Joshua P. Bell for the Electoral District of West Moreton.
In 1874, so popular had Mr. Thorn become, that Mr. Macalister, the Premier, offered
him the portfolio of Postmaster-General and the leadership of the Government in the
Upper House, Mr. Thorn accepted the position, and continued to represent the
Government in that Chamber for two years and a half, until, on the appointment of
Mr. Macalister as Agent-General, the Governor sent for Air. Thorn, and requested
him to form a Government, which he succeeded in doing. This Administration
conducted the affairs of the colony for nearly ten months. Mr. Thorn having resigned
the leadership, Mr. Douglas formed a Ministry, in which Mr. Thorn held the portfolio
of Minister for Works until he resigned for the purpose of making a visit to Europe.
Upon his return, he was elected as a member of the House, and continued to
represent the same constituency for nearly five years. Air. Thorn is at present (1887)
the member for Fassifern, but he does not take the same active interest in public
affairs which characterised him in his younger days. His return for Fassifern without
opposition he has always regarded as a great compliment. Judged by his career, Mr.
Thorn must be regarded more as a statesman than as a politician. To his mind the
minor differences which separate parties should never stand in the way of the welfare
of the country at large. His life has been spent in assisting to develop and improve
the great colony of Queensland, and when the history of the colony is written the
name of George Thorn will be found upon its pages as a man who well deserved the
honours which his fellow-citizens bestowed upon him.


CPI ARLES FERDINAND MARKS, M.D.
a P rev i° us sketch in this volume we alluded to the number of distinguished
1 men Queensland now possesses. It would be, therefore, mere
tautology to go over the same ground again, and we shall consequently
content ourselves by giving a brief account of the life of the gentleman whose name
is at the head of this biography.
Charles F. Marks, M.D., is the son of A. H. Marks, Esq., of the City of
Dublin, and was born on September Bth, 1852, He received his education first at
the Medical College, Epsom, England, and next proceeded to the school of M. Haas
Maraat, in Switzerland. After this he entered the Queen’s University, Ireland, and
obtained the degree of M.D. in the year 1874, and also in the same year became a
Licentiate of the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin. In addition to this appointment, he in
the year 1875 was admitted a Licentiate in Midwifery of King and Queen’s College
of Physicians, Dublin. From Dublin he proceeded to London, where he took his
degree of membership of the College of Surgeons. Thence he returned to Ireland,
and assisted Dr. Leecher, of Armagh, prior to his departure for New Zealand, where
after practising for two years in the Tauranga district, he left for England. He was
associated with Dr. Gwynne, of Shropshire, for the space of one year, and then set
out again for the colonies, and commenced practice at St. George, Queensland, where
he had charge of the District Hospital for some time.
He finally settled in Brisbane in the year 1880, and, owing to his acknowledged
skill and attention to his profession, now enjoys one of the leading positions as a
doctor and surgeon in that city. Dr. Marks holds the following important positions:—
Member of the Medical Board, the Central Board of Health, and the Immigration
Board ; Visiting Surgeon to the Brisbane Hospital; Surgeon Consultant to the Lady
Bowen Hospital; Branch Referee to the Australian Mutual Provident Society in
Queensland. He is a Justice of the Peace, has acted as medical officer to the
Government, and was lately in command of the Ambulance Corps.
The foregoing sketch of this gentleman’s career speaks for itself; he has had
the advantages of a superior education, and great experience in one of the Queen’s
Colleges, where he took his degree, fully warranting this statement; for it is an
acknowledged fact that the Queen’s College medical students undergo a most severe
training, and are all very practical men.
