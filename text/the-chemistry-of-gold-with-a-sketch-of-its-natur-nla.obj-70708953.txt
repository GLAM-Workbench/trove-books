PREFACE.
The recent discoveries in Australia, and the great rush of
emigration to that colony, have drawn more attention to the
chemistry of gold than ever it before obtained, and the de-
mand for information on the subject having been proportion-
ately great; the purpose for which this little work, (the greater
portion of which was embodied in a lecture delivered at a
meeting of the Liverpool Chemists Association,) is published,
is to place within the reach of every intending adventurer, a
description of the simplest and most efficient means of readily
determining whether any substance brought under his notice,
is, or is not gold.
Many branches of the subject such as assaying, and the
metallurgical treatment of gold ores are here but slightly
noticed, for this reason, as a more complete description of
processes only to be successfully carried on by persons
who have had considerable practical experience, would
be of little service to those who had no previous know-
ledge of chemistry, it was thought advisable only to
introduce experiments which are simple in execution,
and give characteristic and unmistakeable results.

THE CHEMISTRY OF GOLD.
CHAPTER I.
INTRODUCTION.
In the symbolical language of the Alchemists, all the earliest
known metals were named after the nearest heavenly lumi-
naries, and, as might have been expected, the first place was
given to what was then, as now, considered the most noble
of all metals ? Gold ; which was known by the name Sol,
and expressed by a circle, the symbol amongst the ancients
of divinity and perfection. This superiority, amidst all the
great discoveries which have since been made, and though
the seven metals known to the alchemists have been in-
creased to fifty, Gold still maintains, nor has ought of its
potency, sovereign power, or absoltue rule over man, been
in the least diminished.
Chemistry, more than any other, science, is pre-
eminently indebted to its influence, for in its infancy,
rarely if ever, were its votaries actuated by a love of
science, cr by a desire to make a knowledge of its principles
subservient to the advancement and increase of human happi-


ness, or the mitigation of human suffering; but by an
inordinate and insatiable craving to discover the grand secret
of transmutation. With this ever looming in the distance,
the old alchemists, animated with an unparalleled devotion to
their art, persevered in their labours with almost superhuman
energy, wasting their fortunes in costly and oft repeated ex-
periments, and never chilled or dispirited, even when they
had passed the age at which most men cease from toil, but
labouring on and on to the last. This untiring zeal, added
to their belief that any substance, even the most apparently
worthless, might contain.?
That precious liquor, whose transmuting dew

rendered it necessary that everything they came in con-
tact with, should, to the best of their ability, undergo an
examination ; a plan of research, guided though it was by
false and unfounded views, unwittingly paved the way to
the most important discoveries, many of which we are
reaping the advantage of at the present day, and which have
most materially promoted the great advancement Chemistry
has of late years made, an advancement unparalleled in the
history of philosophy. Lord Bacon justly compares them to
husbandmen who, searching for an imaginary treasure, fertilize
the soil; and Sir H. Davy to persons w r ho looking for gold,
discover the fragments of beautiful statues, which, separately -
are worthless, and appear of little value to the persons who
found them; but which, when selected and put together by
artists, and their defective parts supplied, are found to be
wonderfully perfect, and worthy of conservation.


However, though the same auriferous mineral is our sub-
ject, the object we have in view is very different. It is not
to seek after the changing of other metals into gold, but to
explain the conditions under which it is found, the character-
istics by which it is distinguished, and the best means of
separating it from the impurities with which it may be
naturally or accidentally contaminated.
Gold is the earliest metal we read of in the records of
man?s progress, and this antiquity is due to its never being
found, like most metals, in combination with other elements,
such as oxygen and sulphur, which frequently obliterate
every external metallic appearance, bnt always in a state
of freedom, maintaining its elementary independence, and
shining with its own peculiar lustre. Its history is re-
plete with interest, from its being the substance in which,
at all periods, the rich men of the world have accumulated
their wealth, and associated as it has always been, with the
progress of nations, and the improvement of civil society.
But these points we must pass by and proceed to others of
more practical importance.
That a metal so valuable, and in search of which, home,
kindred, and friends have been left, and the greatest priva-
tions and dangers cheerfully and willingly encountered, should
be distributed more generally upon the face of the earth than
any other, with the exception of iron, is hardly credible.
Yet such is the case. In this country it has been met with
in Cornwall, Devonshire, and Cumberland; in Lanarkshire
and Glen Turret in Scotland ; and in Ireland considerable
quantities have, at different times, been found among the
Wicklow Hills. But gold is no exception to the law which


limits the value of every earthly treasure. And though
known to he present, it is not in sufficient quantities, within
the circle of the British Isles, to repay the expense of work
ing. To obtain sixteen shillings worth from the pyrites of
the vein, called the ? backbone ? in Cumberland, requires,
according to Mr. Pattinson, the expenditure of a sovereign ;
and in Ireland, during the two years the government had
charge of the workings, and the yield was near one thousand
ounces, the expenses of working, and of various trials in
search of the original deposit, exceeded the income. The
countries in which it is now found in remunerating quantities,
are Asiatic Russia, Transylvania, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, the
East India islands, Africa, California, and the country which,
from the intense interest it at present excites, demands more
than a passing mention?Australia.


CHAPTER 11.
AUSTRALIA, THE GEOLOGY OF ITS GOLD FIELDS, AND THE
METHODS EMPLOYED FOR OBTAINING GOLD.
The presence of gold in Australia was first made public
in the memorable month of May, 1851, though its existence
there had been predicted; three years previously, by Sir
Roderick Murchison, whose personal acquaintance with, and
extensive knowldge of, the gold bearing districts of the
Uralian Mountains, enabled him, with the greatest confi-
dence, to speculate upon its being found at no distant day
among the mountain chains of Australia.
To understand the connection between the Uralian
Mountains, and those of a country so distant as Australia,
and the reason why its presence in the one, should reveal
to the scientific observer its presence in the other, will
necessitate a glance at a few of the more important fea-
tures of geology in reference to the mysterious structure
of the earth, and the formation and distribution of mineral
veins and deposits.


The earth?s surface is composed of two kinds of rocks, *
stratified and unstratified. The stratified have all been de-
posited from water, while the unstratified have been formed
by fire, for which reason, they are also known by the terms
igneous or volcanic rocks, and it is now recognized as an in-
disputable fact, that, at an early period of the earth?s history,
these rocks were in a state of liquidity by heat, and by de-
grees, cooled and became crystallized from the surface down-
wards, a process which there is every reason to believe, is
still going on at a certain depth below the surface of the
earth. Upon these ?the unstratified rocks, which evidently
were the first in existence, there have been deposited from
water, about forty well defined beds, layers or strata of differ-
ent mineral masses, lying upon each other, so as to form the
surface of the globe on which we dwell, f ? These combine
themselves, by natural characters, into three or four grand
groups. Compare them to a set of books, in thirty or forty
volumes, piled up on their flat sides. indeed, can
the whole set of the earth?s strata be displayed, lying each
upon the other, for reasons which will presently appear; and
if it were so at any spot, all the power and art of man could
never penetrate through more than one, two, or three of the
layers. They are placed one over another, in a sure and
known order of succession ; that is, though in no locality are
all to be found, or (which is saying the same thing conversely)
in every locality some are wanting, the order of position is
never violated.
* The word ? rocks ? is not to be understood in its ordinary re-
stricted sense, but as applied indiscriminately to the soft plastic clay
loose sand or gravel, and hardest limestone, marble, or granite,
t Dr. Pye Smith?s Geology and Scripture?a most admirable work.


Let the letters of the alphabet represent the strata thus,
the Tertiary, a, b, c, d, e; the Secondary, i. e. all from the
chalk to the old red sandstone inclusive, f to z ; the Primary,
aa, bb, &c. to jj; then observe that any member or several
members of the series may be absent, for example, d or f, or
ior p; but bis never above a, nor m above k, nor s above g.
When this fact is rightly conceived of, let it be further
observed, that the strata do not lie over each other in con-
tinuous concentric spheroids, like the coats of an onion ;
but may rather be compared to a vast number of wafers, of
irregular forms, laid on a globe, and patched upon each other
in different sets as to thickness, and variously under-passing,
out-cropping, and over-lapping. Now, let the mind imagine
mighty forces from below, acting upon certain points and
along certain lines ; then the wafer patches will be raised to
all angles, bent, broken, their edges often turned up, so that
the edges of lower strata stand in some places over the higher
ones which had been thus shattered. Further, let the mind
conceive of a mass of melted matter, suppose pitch, having
lam some time, quietly underneath the lowest of the wafer
patches ; then boiling up, bursting forth, and in many places
raising the wafers, piercing them, passing through them, and
finally hardening in fantastic shapes, and towering over the
upheaved and fractured outside. This little play of imagina-
tion, will present a pretty fair idea of the real stratification of
the earth?s surface, the eruption of the non stratified (granite
and similar) rocks which have boiled up, elevating linear ridges
(mountain ranges) when they could not pierce through, but
actually piercing through where their force could overcome


the resistance, and when cooled, remaining the magnificent
crags and summits of the loftiest mountains. It must also
be understood, as a matter of the clearest sensible demonstra-
lion, that these processes have occurred several times, at
various and distant intervals, producing among the strata,
many varieties of direction, inclination, contortion, cleavage,
conformity, and nonconformity in reference to each other.?
From this it will appear that, though we have spoken of
the formation of the unstratified prior to the stratified, yet
there are numerous records, imprinted upon the earth s sur-
face, by the hands of the Most High, of immense masses of
melted mineral matter, having at many different periods, sub-
seqent to, and during the formation of, the aqueous rocks,
been, in a manner of which we may form some faint idea
from the effects of volcanic action at the present day, thrust
through the superincumbent strata, with a force so over-
powering, as to overcome almost every resistance. And as
may be well imagined, the character of the aqueous strata in
the more immediate neighbourhood of these intruding fiery
masses, has been materially changed, they having assumed to
a great extent, the crystalline appearance of the igneous
rocks. From which cause, we have another class of rocks
between the other two, called Transformed, that is, altered by
fire, or metamorphic rocks. Now, in conseqnence of these
mighty, and to our finite intellects, inconceivable operations.
? Upon the humblest globe that wheels its course
Amid the giant glories of the sky.?
Mountains which previously existed in one solid mass,
being cracked and torn in different directions, strata which


had been rent asunder, uplifted and overturned agian
subsiding, and the different rocks irregularly cooling
after the intense heat to which they had been subject,
all caused the formation of innumerable cracks, dykes, and
fissures, in which vacancies, various minerals such as quartz,
which is the most abundant, gold, silver, tin, lead, iron, &c.,
were subsequently formed. How and when these mineral
veins were deposited, has been among geologists a subject of
the most extreme difference of opinion; some referring their
formation to the agency of fire ; others to that of water; and
others to electrical and magnetic action. The probability is,
they are the results of many actions, igneous, aqueous, elec-
trical and mechanical, all however, resulting from the ante-
cedent influence of a high temperature below the surface of
the earth.
Gold, when found in situ, is always imbedded in the
quartz veins, and these auriferous deposits only occur in the
unstratified, primary, and metamorphic rocks, and in the
alluvium and diluvium, resulting from the same. For in-
stance, the Uralian mountains are composed of granite, meta-
morphised schists, and other igneous and transformed rocks;
and, if the deductions of geology are to be relied upon, as
recent discoveries have triumphantly proved they are, in the
whole realm of nature, there is not another country, from
whose physical geography, and geological formation, could
more safely have been predicted the presence of gold, than
the great island continent of Australia.
Into a detailed account of all the geological features of
this vast and extraordinary country, the limits of this little


work will not allow me to enter, it must suffice to say, that
unstratified and metamorphic rocks abound; granite, green-
stone, porphyry, basalt, lava, trachyte, trap rocks, mica slate,
gneiss, &c., form the greater portion of the vast mountain
ranges, which extend round the sea coast, and penetrate to a
great distance into the interior. For it is very singular that,
while in most countries the highest mountains decline towards
the sea, there, the reverse is the case, which accounts for
many of the rivers flowing not as ours do, into the sea, but
in the direction of the interior. On the landside of these
great chains of mountains are immense plains at different
elevations, from which again other mountain ranges of various
size and extent arise. In the neighbourhood of Melbourne,
remains of extinct volcanoes may be traced, and the moun-
tains of South Australia, celebrated for their copper and lead
veins, are composed principally of gneis, mica, chlorite, and
clay slate; and though frequently traversed by great quartz
veins, gold is entirely absent.* Great portions of the country
which have not yet undergone the process of ? prospecting ??
are composed of the class of rocks in which gold is usually
found, but they may, and doubtless do, extend for hundreds of
miles without containing a remunerative quantity of gold.
The first discovery was made in Summerhill Creek, one
of the numerous valleys of the Blue Mountains in the neigh-
bourhood of Bathurst, which from being cut up in every di-
rection by thousands of gullies, creeks, and ravines, for many
years after the discovery of the colony, formed an impassable

barrier between Sydney and the interior; soon after, it was
found in the Turon Creek, and the numerous branches and tri-
butaries of the River Macquarrie, and many other places which
have since acquired a world-wide fame. Mr. Stutchbury, the
government geologist, after a survey of the Macquarrie
districts, officially reports* ?that the whole area may be
considered as schistose, principally clay-slate, accompanied
by nearly all the other varieties of slate rocks, in many cases
greatly disturbed by intruded rocks of subsequent igneous
formation; also by a large amount of quartzites in veins or
lodes parallel to the strike of the schist. The quartz is
amorphous, very rarely crystallized; and in the neighbour-
hood of the gold yielding localities, it is accompanied by
titaniferous iron, both crystallized and in loose grains. That
the matrix of the gold is quartz in this district there cannot
be any doubt, so many instances have occurred in which the
quartz still remains attached, and interlaced by the gold, as
also the iron.
Assuming that the auriferous deposits originated in the
quartz rocks, there is no difficulty in accounting for its pre-
sence most abundantly in the various gulleis and creeks so
numerous in this remarkably broken country. The schistose
rocks, so readily acted upon by the atmosphere, constantly
disintegrating and exposing the quartzose dykes, leaves them
unsupported, and, gravitating downwards, the largest blocks
are crushed and crumbled in their onward course, letting

loose the tenacious gold in large or small portions, which, in
obedience to their gravity and the force of the impelling

torrents, roll on until they are arrested for a time in hollows,
or the cleavage fissures of the slaty rocks, or quietly deposited
in the sand, or mud, as the case may be, by the cessation of
the flood, until they are again removed by the repetition of
similar causes; or they may remain for ages undisturbed, by
the torrents taking another course, of which there are so many
instances, leaving ancient bars of shingle debris now covered
by accumulated soil. It therefore follows that gold, even if
it be of the earliest geological origin, may, and will be, accu
inulating in the lower valleys, as long as mountains waste,
and valleys exist for its reception.?
As a rule, the larger pieces will be found nearest the
mountains in which they were originally imbedded, but it does
not follow that such situations will be the most productive ?
true ; Dr. Kerr, of Bathurst, disembowelled from the earth
at one time, three blocks of quartz containing 106 pounds of
the precious metal;* but the rarity of such good fortune
renders the search much more profitable at a greater distance
down the streams and along the plains, where the gold,
though in grains invisible to the naked eye before the soil
is washed, is distributed almost as regular as wheat in a
sown field.
When a district is supposed to contain gold, the first
places to be examined are its rivers and streams, moje partic-
ularly their bends or curves, as in those places the greatest
deposits will always be found. After these have been exa-
mined, traces of former streams should be sought for, and
* The full particulars of this most extraordinary discovery are gra-
phicly related in the Bathurst Free Press, July 16th, 1851.


frequently their beds will be found to yield a highly remu-
nerative quantity of gold.
The auriferous drift varies in depth from a few inches to
thirty or forty feet, through several beds of soil, gravel, and
quartz pebbles, &c., down to the blue pipe clay, which is the
lowest gold-yielding stratum. Below this is a thick bed of
white pipe clay, but its ?mission? appears to be a second
?Potteries,? which, at a future day, shall elaborate from what
is now cast aside as worthless, an infinite variety of useful
and elegant, articles.
Among the many characteristics of gold, which will
shortly be more fully referred to, one of the most im-
portant is its high specific gravity, that is in its relative
weight when compared with an equal bulk of any other
substance. And it is this which is taken advantage of at the
diggings, to separate the heavy gold from the light
impurities with which it may be contaminated.
As before stated, gold is always found imbedded in quartz
or distributed through alluvial deposits. The process of ex-
tracting it from the original veins is called ? mining, and
can only be profitably carried on by a large and wealthy com-
pany, provided with the requisite machinery for crushing and
stamping; in fact, for bringing it into the condition in which
it is found in Australia.
And this gold mining, though carried on under the most
favourable circumstances, is a most hazardous speculation ;
indeed, the greatest care and skill are required to cover ex-
penses thousands have been ruined by it, and there are few
if any companies in which the shares are worth their original


cost, and many in which they are not worth the scrip. In
Australia, fortunately, the most speculative and laborious part
of the operation is already performed, nature herself having
done all the crushing and stamping. For thousands of years
the processes of disruption, dislocation, and disintegration,
have been beneath the irresistable hand of time, and through
the agency of wind, rain, and frost, slowly but unceasingly
going on.
At the same time it must be observed, there is every pro-
bability of matrix gold, in its original bed, being discovered
among the mountain ranges of Australia, when, of course, the
usual processes of mining will have to be resorted to. The
yield of a rock, or soil, to be at all remunerative, must be at
least twenty-four grains to the hundred weight, many soils
yield ounces ; but even the most auriferous will require every
care to free the precious metal from such a large relative pro-
portion of extraneous matter. For effecting this, the machines
employed are numerous, but all work upon the same prin-
ciple, of separating by subsidence in water, the heavy gold
from the light siliceous soil or gravel. From the earliest
being worked on rockers they are called ? cradles,? and consist
of different shaped troughs or bowls, with one or more perfo-
rated divisions, the meshes of which, if more than one series,
diminish from the top downwards. On the upper sieve the
soil is placed, the cradle set in motion, and water plentifully
supplied. The perforations prevent the stones from entering
the cradle, the water washes off the earthy matter, and the
gold is left behind mixed with a black ferruginous sand, on
the lowest and finest sieve.


To work a cradle of this description, four men are
required, one to collect the soil, a second to feed the trough,
a third to keep it in constant motion, by means of an up-
right handle nailed to the side, and a fourth to attend to
the regular and judicious supply of water. From their
simplicity, such cradles are most commonly used, though
they do not prevent the finer particles of gold from running
off with the water, to save which, the stream holding the
particles in suspension, is made to flow over coarse canvass,
sheep skins, or unplained boards, the irregularities of which
retain the gold. They must be washed every two or three
hours, or a slippery coat of slime is deposited over which
the gold will slip away. Independently and sometimes
in conjunction with the cradles, the process of ? amalgama-
tion? is employed for the purpose of collecting the grain
gold, and when the particles are in a state of minute division,
it may be adopted with great advantage, an advantage
indeed considerably increased in Australia by the Govern-
ment notifying that a royalty will be charged ? on all matrix
gold obtained, if found on Crown lands, ten per cent, and
five per cent if on private lands. These rates will be com-
puted on the actual produce valued at �3 per ounce, if
produced by separation only, and �2 Bs. per ounce by
amalgamation. ?
When Quicksilver is brought into contact with some of
the metals, of which for convenience gold may be taken as
the type, combination immediately takes place, and the
mercury losing its fluidity, forms a pasty amalgam. This,
when compressd in Chamois leather, parts with a portion


of its mercury, but to free it from the whole, it must be
subjected to distillation in an iron retort. By this means
the mercury, with hardly any loss, may be recovered and
used over and over again, so that the government distinction
of twelve shillings per ounce, is much more than sufficient
to cover the expense, even in employing the process, when
ordinary washing would otherwise suffice.
The gold left behind in the retort is in a spongy mass,
which can be fused in a crucible and run into moulds, but
when mixed with iron or lead, must be separated by the
ordinary assay. In Australia, amalgamation has not yet
been much resorted to, in consequence of the absence of
native mercury in that rich and prolific counfry, but should
it exist, as it does in California, it will greatly increase the
development of the Australian gold fields.
The most important of the quicksilver ores, is cinnabar or
sulphide of mercury, from which the pure metal is obtained,
by distillation with lime. It is a heavy ore, with a glistening
and red ochreous appearance.


CHAPTER 111.
THE CHEMISTRY OF GOLD, AND THE MOST SIMPLE MEANS OF
DISTINGUISHING IT FROM EVERY OTHER SUBSTANCE.
Having now traced the natural history of gold, its geo-
logical distribution, and the means employed for most eco-
nomically obtaining it in a marketable condition, we come to
its chemistry, and a description of those characteristics by
which it can be readily and easily distinguished from every
other substance, which there is the least possibility of mis-
taking for it.
Gold is always found in the metallic state, and never as a
sulphide, as iron and copper are frequently met with, but
generally alloyed with some other metal, such as silver, iron,
copper, and platina. * Its colour is not always the same (
but considerably modified by the character of its alloy; silver
giving it a pale colour, copper a reddish tinge, and platina a
greyish yellow. The difference in the colour of our gold coin

Appendix A.


for instance, must have struck every body, it arises from the
alloy used, whether silver or copper. The pale coins in which
silver is used are all of a date prior to 1836 ; since which
period, copper has been employed, in the proportion of one
part of copper, to eleven of pure gold. Twenty pounds troy are
coined into 934� soverigns; one pound troy, therefore, pro-
duces 46f� sovereigns. Jewellers? gold is an alloy of less
value than coin or standard gold; though, from the skill with
which a rich gold surface is sometimes imparted to an inferior
alloy, it is difficult to discern at once, without experiment the
real value of any article of gold manufacture.
The value of any specimen of gold, and the proportion of
foreign metal it contains is expressed in carats, the purest
gold without alloy being called fine or ?twenty-four carats,?
and that which is alloyed, as so many carats fine as it has
proportional parts of pure gold, for instance, our coin con-
taining two parts of alloy in twenty-four, is said to be ?twenty-
two carats fine,? while if it contained eight parts of foreign
metal, and sixteen of gold, it would be ? sixteen carats fine.?
The Dutch ducats are carats fine, the Austrian 33|, the
American eagles 21-&. By some jewellers a black siliceous
stone, called the touchstone, is used for estimating the value
of different specimens of gold. Marks are made on the stone
by needles of gold of known fineness called trial needles, and
streaks are then drawn with the gold to be valued. The es-
timate of its value is made according to the colour of the
needle to which it most closely approximates.

cover fifty-six square inches. The same weight may also
be drawn out into five hundred feet of wire. It used to
be a common saying that a horse and his rider could be
gilded with a ducat. Its point of fusion is high, being
2016� F, but it is unchanged by fire, a quantity having
been kept for thirty weeks in a molten state, in a glass-house
furnace, without th e loss of a single grain, or the least change
in its properties.
Foremost, and from its simplicity and ease of applica
tion, pre-eminently the most important of the character-
istics which serve to distinguish gold from every other
substance, is the determining of its specific gravity; as will
be seen by a glance at the subjoined table, it is much
higher than any other substance, which under any circum-
stances, might be mistaken for it, and those metals which
are higher, are not only few, but rare and exceedingly
valuable.


involves two processes, one when they are in mass, and
the other when in powder or grains. The principle is in both
cases the same, viz., relatively estimating the weight of the
gold in comparison with the weight of an equal volume of
water; but as it is important that every person proceeding to a
gold yielding country should be able to perform, at least, these
simple experiments, I will explain by examples which in
general are more easily understood, comprehended, and ap-
plied, than definitions or expressions of abstract terms, how
specific gravities are taken.
Suppose we take a nugget of gold with or without any ad-
hering quartz, it must first be weighed in the ordinary way,
then, by means of a horse hair, or fine filament of silk, it must
be suspended from the scale of the balance, and immersed in
a vessel of water, at a temperature of 60� F, taking care that
it is surrounded by at least half-an-inch of water on all sides.
From these two known weights, one in air, and the other in
water, we are able by the following simple calculation to
obtain the specific gravity.

We will now suppose the gold, instead of being in mass, was
in dust or grains, the operation in that case would require
modifying, but we have the same preliminary points to de-
termine. The following method will be found both simple
and convenient.
Into a bottle, holding a known quantity of pure water,
at a temperature of 60� F, say 1000 grains, weigh a conve-
nient, quantity, say 100 grains, of the gold dust, fill up with
water, and weigh. The bottle now contains less water by a
quantity equal to the bulk of the gold introduced, say 5.5
grains, and having ascertained this ; by the following calcula-
tion, we shall obtain the specific gravity.
W eight of water displaced
By this difference between the weight of the water before and
after the introduction of the gold, the weight of the specimen


must be divided 18.1 the specific gravity of the gold
dust. Or thus ;
5.5 : 1 : : 100 : 18.1
o *o.? Weight of gold dust In air
> Specific gravity Weigtit of water displaced
It will be found convenient to have a bottle on purpose
for taking specific gravities, holding five hundred or on�
thousand grains, and marked on the neck, the exact point
to which it must be filled. If such a one, however, is
not at hand, any vial may be used, the capacity of which,
at a temperature of 60� F has, by experiment, been ascer-
tained. And it is very important to observe that no air
bubbles are left in the bottle after introducing the solid
substance, if they are, their presence will completely vitiate
the experiment.
Sometimes it is desired to ascertain the value of a
specimen of auriferous quartz, and as we know the spe-
cific gravity of gold, and also that of quartz, we are
able to do so; but the operation is much more complex
than either of the former. The necessary formula for the
purpose will be found in the appendix,* and has been kindly
drawn out for me, by my friend Mr. George Hamilton, as
simply and clearly as it is possible to be expressed.
A rough estimate of the value of a specimen of gold,
may be obtained by taking the specific gravity, multiplying
by four, the result being the approximate value in shillings.
Gold is not dissolved by any acid, with the exception
of aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids.
* See Appendix C.


and the solvent power of this mixture entirely depends
upon the liberation of chlorine, which acting upon the gold,
forms ter chloride of gold.
That such is the case, is proved by our being able to
dissolve it in other ways, simply by the action of free
chlorine, for instance, if we add hydrochloric acid to bleaching
powder, chlorine is immediately evolved, and the gold dis-
solved ; or if to a little saltpetre and common salt, we add
sulphuric acid, the same result is attained, nor are our
resources yet exhausted, for if we add water to ? Collins?
Disinfecting Powder,? and gold leaf, terchloride of gold will
still be formed.
Aqua regia, however, is the best solvent, and the others
should only be used in cases of emergency, and then the
gold must be in a state of minute division.
The reactions of gold when in solution, are so peculiar,
decisive, and characteristic, that it may invariably be detected,
in the presence of every other metal, and the merest tyro
after once performing the necessary experiments, and notic-
ing the results, will never mistake or confound the reactions
with those of any other substance.
The metals with which the gold seeker is most likely
to meet, and with one or all of which, gold is generally
alloyed, are silver, platina, copper, and iron, and for con-
venience, and facility of reference, I have placed their
reactions in a tabular form. To the practical chemist,
all these, and many other reactions, are important and fre-
quently brought into requisition; but as such a general
application would be impossible for persons situated as


emigrants in a strange country must necessarily be, I will
direct special attention only to a few, and those the simplest
and most characteristic.
Protochloride of Tin from a strong solution, throws
down brown pulverulent gold-tin; from dilute solutions, the
?purple of Cassius? is precipitated, which is bright red,
when a small quantity of tin solution is used, and violet
when the quantity is larger. The exact composition of
this precipitate is not known, and consequently the theories
respecting it are numberless; this circumstance, however,
does not at all interfere with the delicacy of the test, which
will detect gold in the proportion of less than one grain
to ten quarts of liquid.
Protosulphate of Iron, equally as delicate, precipitates
the gold as a soft brown powder, which colours the liquid
brown by reflected light; and by transmitted light, if the
solution is not too strong, it appears blue.
Many organic compounds added to a gold solution,
precipitate metallic gold. Oxalic acid is perhaps as conve-
nient to use as any; a short time after its addition, a reddish
brown precipitate is produced, with an evolution of Carbonic
acid. If Oxalic acid is not at hand, a seidlitz powder
may be used, but in this case, the liquid must be boiled
when the gold will be thrown down as a black powder, If
these solutions are allowed to stand a few hours, the sides
of the vessel will be covered -with a thin film of metallic
gold. The reaction of gold with organic compounds is so
delicate, that its employment has been suggested for the
detection of small portions of organic matter, in water or
other liquid.

SILVER.
Silver is the metal with which gold is more frequently,
and in greater proportion found alloyed, than any other.
It ranges t from 0. 16 per cent in the gold sand of Katha-
rinenburg, which is the purest native gold yet found, to
72 per cent in the auriferous silver from Konigsberg. The
methods employed for its separation, will be explained when
we come to the metallurgy of gold.
Its reactions are numerous and well defined, but the
only one to which special attention need be drawn, is the
effect of hydrochloric acid, or a solution of common salt
(chloride of sodium) upon its solutions, A white curdy
precipitate is immediately produced, which is not soluble
in boiling nitric acid; but on the addition of ammonia,
immediately disappears. The ammonia must be added in
excess to neutralize the free acid. This test is exceedingly
characteristic, as there are only two other metals which are
precipitated in a similar manner, lead and mercury, and their
after behaviour unmistakeably distinguishes them from
each other. Chloride of lead is soluble in water, but
chloride of silver is not, nor in nitric acid, but very readily
in ammonia, while chloride of mercury is blackened by
the addition of ammonia.
PLATINA.
Platina is a very widely distributed, though rare metal,
and is most generally found in gold bearing regions. In


Australia it occurs, but the Government geologist states
he has only met with it in very few instances. As it has,
however, a very unobtrusive appearance, it might easily be
passed over, and it is not at all unlikely, when the great
attraction of its more brilliant associate, has in some degree
waned, the search for it may have a more successful result.
And here it may be incidentally mentioned that diamonds
have frequently been found accompanying gold and platina
ores, they have been found in California, and why not in
Australia ? They always occur crystallized, as transparent
octohedrons, that is in the form of two four-sided pyramids
joined together at the bases. The value of rough diamonds
is about �5O per ounce.
Platina often occurs as an alloy of gold, and it is also
found in grains, mixed with sand or gravel, never having
yet been seen in the rocks in which it was first imbedded,
but which are supposed to be serpentine. It is the heaviest
metal known, having a specific gravity of 21, and in appear-
ance somewhat resembles steel. To the practical chemist
it is invaluable, for not only does it resist the action of all
the acids, with the exception of aqua regia, but is infusible
by any furnace heat, and there are many investigations he
would have been unable to prosecute, had he not had at
his command, a metal possessing such valuable and impor-
tant properties as platina. The most characteristic test
of platina, is its reaction with chloride of potassium, or
chloride of ammonium, (salammoniac.) The best way of
applying this test, is to place a small quantity of the solution
suspected to contain platina, in a watch glass, add a few


drops of a solution of salammoniac, and the same quantity
of spirits of wine, stir with a glass rod, when if platina is
present, a yellow crystalline precipitate will be formed,
which is the chloro-platinate of ammonia. If salammoniac
is not at hand, the same effect will be produced by adding
a few drops of solution of ammonia or hartshorn, to a platina
solution, containing free hydrochloric acid. The reason why
spirits of wine is added, is that the platina precipitate
is more insoluble in it than in water, and forms quicker
and more abundantly in its presence. By referring to the
table, it will be seen that oxalic acid does not precipitate
platina, neither does protochloride of tin, but it produces
a beautiful brown red solution.
IRON.
Iron may be detected most readily by the blue precipi-
tate it gives with prussiate of potash, (ferrocyanide of po-
tassium) and also by the black precipitate produced by
infusion of galls or tea.
COPPER.
Copper is very easily recognized by the blue colour it
gives to its solutions, even when present in very small
quantity, as may be seen by dissolving a sixpence-in a little
nitric acid, when the solution will not be colourless, as it
would have been, or nearly so, had silver only been present,
but bluish from, the small quantity of copper used as a
hardening alloy.

Prussiate of potash produces a dark purplish brown
precipitate, and ammonia throws down a bluish green pre-
cipitate, the blue hydrate of the oxide of copper, but which
is entirely soluble in excess, increasing the colour of the
original solution, to a most beautiful azure blue.
We have now rapidly gone over the principal reactions of
gold, and its alloys, silver, platina, iron and copper, and the
annexed table which is a recapitulation of many of the tests
we have had before us, is the simplest method of detecting
the presence or proving the absence of any or all of them, in
a specimen of auriferous quartz or native gold. The experi-.
menter must be very particular in observing, that the car-
bonate of soda is not to be added to the solution till cold ,
otherwise, the whole of the gold will be thrown down, as well
as the iron and copper.
The substances which are most commonly mistaken for
gold, and which the gold-seeker may accidentally meet with,
or which may be purposely introduced to his notice, are cop-
per pyrites (sulphide of copper); iron pyrites (sulphide of
iron); yellow mica; pinchbeck; brass, and similar metallic
alloys. Many persons will doubtless think it impossible to
mistake such substances for gold, but to the eye of the inex-
perienced, there is a great similarity, and numbers have
had to pay dear for learning, that ?all is not-gold that
glitters.? Dr. Playfair, mentioning a case in point, says
? some time since, when one of my colleagues resided at a sea-
port town, a ship arrived from Ichaboe, having as part of its
cargo, a number of bags of supposed gold. This ? gold ?
in reality yellow mica?had been found on the surface and


swept up by brooms into bags, in which it was preserved as a
great treasure. Two dealers in the precious metals, went to
examine it, and one prudently brought a portion in the even-
ing to my colleague to assay. The other, hoping to steal a
march on his fellow-trader, went on board and bought the
whole lot, in the middle of the night, at a high price, the
material being utterly worthless, in a commercial point of
view, and not containing a grain of gold.?
Whenever a specimen is suspected, if possible, try the
specific gravity, that is an infallible test ?copper pyrites, the
heaviest found native, having only a specific gravity of 5,
while it is a very poor specimen of gold which is not more
than 12. A common penknife will also show the difference,
as far as regards either of the pyrites, for both are brittle,
and will break or crack on applying the knife, while gold will
cut like a piece of lead. This is as important a distinction
as it is simple. Gold, as before stated, is always found native
in the metallic state, while in pyrites the metals are combined
with sulphur, a fact which may immediately be ascertained
by crushing a little, placing on a bright shilling, and holding
over the flame of a spirit lamp, when the silver will be imme-
diately tarnished. When dissolved in acid, both the copper
and iron may be detected by their characteristic reactions,
which have been before alluded to.
No other test is required for yellow mica, than trying the
specific gravity, which is only that of sand 3. It does not
give the least reaction with any of the tests mentioned
Brass and pinchbeck, or such metallic alloys, were during the
Californian mania, said to be manufactured at Birmingham,


purposely to resemble gold, and then exported to that country,
for the purpose of offering to the ? verdant ? seeker after
wealth, immediately on his landing, when he was naturally
most unsuspiciously anxious to become quickly and largely
acquainted with the native produce of the ? diggings.? These
alloys may all most simply be detected, by treating them with
a little nitric acid, and heating over a spirit lamp, when, if
they are gold, no action will take place, but if not, and only
a delusion and a snare, dense red fumes will be given off.


CHAPTER IV.
SKETCH OF THE METALLURGY OF GOLD.
Thus far incur remarks upon the chemistry of gold, we
have referred entirely to liquid testing, or, as it is called, the
? wet process,? in contradistinction to another method known
as the ? dry process,? and, as far as regards analysis and testing
this process includes the blowpipe, which in the hands of an
experienced manipulator, is an instrument of the greatest
value, and enables him, much quicker than by liquid testing,
to obtain results of the most decisive kind, and an exact
knowledge of all the constituents of any ore presented to him.
Its range is amazing, as by its assistance he can perform on a
small scale every furnace operation, at any degree of tempera-
ture from the lowest roasting to the most intense reducing
one.
in the hands, however, of persons who have had little or
no previous experience in chemical manipulation?and such
are they for whom this little work is written ?it is far inferior
to liquid testing, as it requires an amount of manual dexterity,


close attention, and quick apprehension of the thousand and
one phenomena it developes, only to be obtained by practice.*
These remarks apply with the same weight to the more
legitimate operations of the ? dry process,? required in the
metallurgical treatment and assaying of gold ores; it seldom,
however, happens that these processes are attempted to be
performed by the first finders of the gold, involving as they
do an amount of skill and experience only attained by persons
who, for many years, have devoted to them their exclusive
attention. At the same time I will give a slight sketch of
the more important of these operations, as every intelligent
emigrant, though not intending to prosecute them himself,
ought to have a general idea of the principles upon which they
are founded.
After the gold has-been obtained, the first operation is To
melt it into ingots, and if it is in the form of dust or nuggets,
this is simply and easily done, by introducing it into a black
lead crucible, with the addition of a little dry borax, and ex-
posing to the requisite heat in a suitable furnace.
When the metal is melted, the slag which has been formed
with the borax, and which is swimming on the top, must be
thickened by the addition of bone-ash and skimmed off, after
which, the metal may be run into the usual ingot mould.
When, however, the gold is obtained by the operation of
mining, and is contaminated with its matrix quartz, and other
foreign matters, considerable modification of this process is

required, if, indeed, it would be remunerative to follow it at
all. Auriferous quartz may be submitted to a temperature
much higher than the point at which gold melts, without any
separation of the metal, although it is in a perfectly fluid
state; this arises from the infusible nature of the quartz,
which being in a much greater relative proportion, prevents
all the small isolated particles of gold from collecting to-
gether.
It is therefore necessary means should be devised for
liquifying the quartz, and enabling the gold to sink to the
bottom of the crucible ; and this is done by the addition of
some alkali, such as soda, potash, or lime, (the latter in large
operations, from its cheapness, is always used) which possess
the valuable property of combining with siliceous compounds
and forming a fusible glass. When this is done, there is still
another difficulty to be surmounted, for the gold being in such
a small quantity compared to the quartz, a portion of the
precious metal must necessarily be lost in mechanically sepa-
rating them; to prevent which, melted lead is added, and
this metal acts towards gold, under heat, in a similar manner
to mercury in the cold; it dissolves the gold, and by a subse-
quent process, again delivers it up undiminished in quantity
or quality.
Iron pyrites may be used as a diluting agent instead of
lead, and in Hungary, where the pyrites is auriferous, this
process has been long carried on with advantage, but at the
conclusion of the operation, lead is employed to separate the
gold from the iron.


?*The extraction of gold from lead is invariably effected by
what is termed cupellation, a process in use from the most
remote antiquity. When lead is heated to a temperature
above its melting point, it rapidly combines with the oxygen
of the air, or burns, the product being yellow oxide of lead ;
and when the temperature is raised to about bright redness
this oxide melts, and is then known as litharge. But when
gold is heated with access of air, even at the highest tempera-
ture of our furnaces, it neither volatilizes nor combines with
oxygen. Melted oxide of lead very readily permeates various
substances; such, for instance, as the refractory material of
various crucibles. One of the substances most readily infil-
trated by it is bone earth, burnt and reduced to fine powder,
and then compressed into a solid state in a mould. Into a
small, short cylinder of iron, beat some pounded and sifted
bone-ash ; then place upon the surface of the bone-ash, which
should be made concave, a piece of lead of the size of a small
shot. Direct upon it the outer point of a blowpipe flame.
The lead will rapidly oxidise, and the surface of the small
melted globule of lead will be seen to be covered with an iri
descent film in rapid motion. This film is melted oxide of
lead, which is no sooner produced than it is immediately ab-
sorbed by the bone-ash with which it comes in contact, just
as a drop of water is absorbed by a piece of blotting paper.
But no sooner is this film removed, then it is replaced by
another, a fresh surface of metallic lead being exposed to oxi-
dation. There is thus a continuous production of absorption
*Dr. Percy on the Metallurgical Treatment of Gold ores.


of oxide of lead, and at length every trace of metal disappears.
When cold the bone-ash will have a fine yellow colour, due to
its impregnation with oxide of lead; and during the course
of the process of oxidation, vapour will be observed proceeding
from the globule of metal, which is the vapour of metallic
lead in the act of conversion into oxide. If, instead of thus
treating a shot of pure lead, an alloy of gold and lead be
similarly treated, then the lead will disappear as before,
and the gold will remain on the surface of the bone-ash,
as a shining globule.?
This is an exact account of the principles of the process
always employed on the large scale for separating gold from
lead; but it is only when the ores are rich, that the pro-
cesses of smelting can be profitably employed, when they
are poor, the gold is almost always separated by amalgama-
tion, which has been previously referred to, and which has
hitherto been indispensable in working ores similar to some
found in Brazil, in which the ratio of gold to the other
materials is as one part to half a million.
However, within this last few months, a patent has
been taken out by Mr. Longmaid, for a new method of
smelting gold ores, which, if his expectations are realized,
will enable the smelter to separate the precious metal from
its poorest ores, as economically by the process of fusion
as by that of amalgamation.
Mr. Longmaid?s process consists in fusing the crushed
ores with a mixture of lime and oxide of iron, with which
the silica combines to form a fusible slag. Plates of wrought


iron are then from time to time introduced into the fused
mass, and again withdrawn as soon as the surface is coated
with a thin film of gold. These plates are immediately
plunged into a vessel of melted lead, which dissolves the
gold off the iron, when they are again ready to be dipped
in the furnace, the process being repeated as long as any
gold adheres to the plates.
Sufficient practical experience has not yet" been had of
this process, to decide whether or no it really is as economical
as amalgamation. If so, and mercury should not be found
native in Australia, it will doubtless have an extensive
influence in developing the gold yielding resources of that
country.
Assaying or the analysing of auriferous ores in the
?dry way,? may be regarded to a great extent, as the opera
tion of smelting in miniature, and it is the method always
employed by metallurgists, for estimating the quantity of
metal in any given ore, though as before stated, to be success-
fully prosecuted, requires the greatest skill and delicacy of
manipulation.
In the first place, a known weight of ore is taken, and
by the agency of heat, and the proper fluxes, the metal
contained, is reduced, and forms a button at the bottom of the
crucible. This button, most generally an alloy of gold,
silver, copper, iron, and lead, the latter having been added
as a diluent, is next subjected to the operation of cupellation.
the principles of which, have been already explained. For
conducting this operation, a suitable furnace is required,
in which is placed a ? muffle.? or small oven-shaped vessel


of fire clay, closed at one of its extremities, and furnished
with perpendicular slits in the sides and end, for the purpose
of allowing a free circulation of air.
, When fixed, it is so arranged that the open end corres-
ponds to an opening in the side of the furnace, which
position admits of its being heated on every side, while
the interior is constantly traversed by a highly oxidising
current of air. The muffle having been heated, the cupel
is introduced, and the button of metal placed upon it,
when the lead, copper, and iron contained in the. alloy
quickly become oxidised, part is volatilized, but the greater
portion sinks into the cupel, and the gold still alloyed
with the silver, remains as a bright globule on the surface.
It is then removed, rolled into a thin sheet, and coiled
round a goose quill, to form a ? cornet,? in order to be
subjected to the operation of parting, or quartation. The
reason of its being termed quartation, arises from the fact,
that, though silver alone is readily acted upon and dissolved
by nitric acid, yet when alloyed in a less proportion than
three parts of silver to one of gold, the gold throws around
it a protecting influence, and prevents the acid from dis-
solving it. It is therefore necessary the proportion of silver
should be more than three times that of gold, so that when
subjected to the action of strong nitric acid, hot, and several
times renewed, the whole of the silver is dissolved. The
gold left behind, is of a dull red colour, and requires remov-
ing to a crucible, and heating to low redness, to recover
its usual well known metallic appearance. Weighed, the
result gives the amount of pure gold in the ore examined.


Such is a slight sketch of these metallurgical operations ;
if fuller particulars and further information are required,
reference must be made to more extended works, entirely
devoted to the subject 5 but it is seldom they are ever
attempted to be prosecuted by persons who have not had
some previous practical experience. And though for analysis,
to the professional assayer, the dry way is indispensably
necessary, and incomparably superior to any other, yet to
the inexperienced student, and majority of emigrants, liquid
testing is far more practicable and facile, and much quicker
learnt and applied.
As it cannot be expected that persons whose previous
avocations and pursuits have never brought them into con-
tact with chemical apparatus, will intuitively be able to
select the simplest'and cheapest description for performing
the experiments referred to, I have annexed a list of such
as are absolutely indispensable, and with which every intel-
ligent adventurer ought to provide himself, as in a country
possessing so many forms of mineral wealth as Australia,
circumstances may arise when he is far away from any one
capable of giving either advice or assistance, and when the
means of performing one or two decisive experiments would
be of the utmost value.

With this simple and cheap apparatus every experiment
suggested in these pages, and many others may be performed,
and it ought to be the aim of every adventurer in a strange
country, more especially in one evidently teeming with
mineral wealth, independently of its other industrial advan-
tages, to make himself acquainted not merely with the
chemistry of gold, but with the fundamental principles of
chemical science, for though our knowledge as yet of the
resources of Australia is but limited, though there are
hundreds of square miles yet unexplored by any scientific
observer, and though immense tracts of mountain chains,
valleys, creeks, and plains, have been but imperfectly ex-
amined, and may yet contain mineral deposits of extent and
value far beyond our present conceptions; still our imperfect
knowledge enables us confidently to assert that Australia con-


tains within its seagirt boundaries an amount of mineral
wealth unparalelled by any other country on the face of the
globe.
And who so likely to be the successful explorer of such a
rich and virgin country, who so likely to detect the external
evidence of internal wealth, or beneath the cover of an un-
propitious, unattractive, and even repulsive appearance, to be
able to say, after the performance of a few simple experi.
ments, such and such a substance exists, ?as the intelligent
and industrious emigrant who has stored his mind with
scientific knowledge, has studied the characteristics and
varied phases under which ordinary minerals usually preseiit
themselves, and the rocks in which they are generally found.
He it is who is in a much better position to have his ex-
ertions crowned with abundant success, and whose life and
labours are more likely to increase the honour, repute, and
capabilities of his adopted home, than the man who slightingly
estimates the value of mental culture, habits of observation,
and scientific knowledge, and whose hope of success rests
entirely upon accident and chance.

APPENDIX B.
Letter containing the official Analysis of Australian Gold
(Correspondence presented to both Houses of Parliament)
Pitt Street, Sydney, May 24th, 1851.
I have the honour to hand you herewith the result of
my analysis of the piece of Australian gold, obtained from you a few
days since, and would remark that it has been conducted with every
care to ensure an accurate result; the processes have been those
resorted to at the Royal Mint; and from previous assays made by
myself on large quantities of Californian gold sent from this, the
results in England have so nearly tallied, that I flatter myself the
following will he found a very near approximation to the truth, if
not exact.
I have, &c.,

The gold is therefore of twenty two carats, value �3 17s. 10d� per
ounce, containing 1 dwt. and 16 grs. of fine silver, the value of which
at ss. 6d. per ounce, is 6�d.

But if must be remembered that the average is hardly likely to
be so high, as many larger pieces, doubtless contain more silver.

APPENDIX C.
Formula for calculating by the specific gravity, how much Gold
a specimen of auriferous quartz contains.
Let H = weight of heavy body (Au) in air.
h = ? ? ? in water.
H ?h=do. of its own volume of water.
H?h : H:: 1 : S its specific gravity.
(H?;b)S = H (1)
Again, let L=weight of light body (Si 0 3 ) in air.
1 = ? ? in water.
L?l = do. of its own volume of water.
L?l :L:: 1 ; s its specific gravity.
.*.(L ?l)s=L ... ... (2)
And let C = weight of compound+H+L (Au. +Si 0 3 ) in air.
And c = ? ? in water=h+l.
C ?c: C:: 1 : f its specific gravity.
(M/=C (3)
Now from these three (1) (2) (3) equations all the rest may
be derived.
c
From (3)? =C?c=(H+L)?(h+l)
/
=(H ?h)+(L ?1) (a)
But from (1) and (2)
H L
1 = (H ?h)+{L ?l)

By equating left hand numbers of (a) and (b) we have

This formula, expressed in words, will give?
1. Take the difference between the specific gravity of the compound
and that of the quartz.
2. Multiply that difference by the specific gravity of gold.
3. Multiply that product by the weight of the compound of quartz
and gold. Thus we obtain a number which has to be divided by the
product of the specific gravity of the compound into the difference
between the specific gravity of quartz and gold.
The quotient is the weight of the gold.

Value of the troy
The stock of gold and silver coin in Europe in the year 1599, the
earliest period about which there are any accurate details was
�130,000,000.


From 1600 to 1700, the entire supply of gold for Europe was obtained
from America, whose mines are estimated in the one hundred years
to have produced �337,500,000 worth of the precious metals Of
this �33,000,000 were sent to the Phillipine Islands, India, and
China; and it is estimated that �60,000,000 of gold were employed
in decorating churches, and for ornamental purposes generally;
and if �34,000,000 is allowed as the loss by wear and other causes,
?a very low estimate, the amount of coined money in Europe will
he in 1699 �297,000,000
?" The amount of gold and silver coin in Europe at the end of the
eighteenth century I have not been able to ascertain, hut there was
produced in the different mines from 1700 to 1 99, about
�705,000,000, an average increase of more than �7,000,0000 per
annum.

APPENDIX F.
YIELD OF GOLD IN AUSTRALIA.
?By the late India and China overland mail intelligence has been re.
ceived from the gold fields, where the yields appear to be greater than
ever. With regard to the Victoria Diggings, accounts from Melbourne
to September 7th contain astounding details of the prodigious yield
of the gold fields, exceeding all previous advices, notwithstanding
operations were in a great measure restricted owing to the prevalence
of heavy rains. The annual yields amounted to the enormous sum of
ten millions sterling, and this, it was confidently expected, would be
doubled or even trebled for the year ending September, 1853. During
the month of August the weekly arrivals of the precious metal at Mel-
bourne averaged 30,000 ounces, and the beginning of September


opened a fair prospect of this prodigious amount being donbled, as
thousands of miners were arriving or on their way from all quarters of
the globe. The Anaki-hill fields and land in the Forest Creek district
have been found to contain large quantities of gold. The Daisy-hill
Diggings had attracted a population of about one hundred miners,
chiefly Adelaide men, who stopped on their way to Mount Alexander.
The richness of the soil had in a great measure indemnified these
novices for their want of skill and mining experience. Many of them
made three pounds weight (�136) and more in a week. Large quan-
tities of gold arrived in Melhounre within the first days of September,
and .�400,000 of specie were imported into the colony in the last week
of August and the first week of September. The Government escort
from Ballarat brought to Melbourne and Geelong, on the 4th of Sept.
4,627 ounces; and on the 6th the Victoria Escort Company brought
33,805 ounces; making a total of 38,433 ounces. The most brilliant
test of the continuity of the yield of the two great gold fields of Mount
Alexander and Ballarat is given in a series of escort returns published
in the Melbourne Argus, embracing the period from October, 1851, to
the end of August, 1852. The following are the totals: October, (1851,)
18,482 ounces ; November, 60,878 ounces; December. 169,685 ounces ;
January, (1852,) 107,216 ounces; February, 111,778 ounces; March,
122,778 ounces; April, 135,112 ounces; May, 138,906 ounces; June,
162,990 ounces ; July, 353,182 ounces ; and August, 350,968 ounces;
making, with the addition of an odd 40,000 ounces from some smaller
places, an enormous total of 1,771,974 ounces, or between seventy-three
and seventy-four tons, of gold. Of course this statement relates only
to part of the fabulous yield of the Victoria gold fields. The following
statement will perhaps come near the actual yield:?Amount actually
shipped, 1,240,528 ounces; amount deposited in the Treasury and
Banks, 310,377 ounces; amount paid into Adelaide Assaye-office,
264,317 ounces; probable amount exported in private hands, 337,200
ounces ; probable amount in private hands in Melbourne and Geelong,
100,000 ounces; probable amount in the hands of diggers at the gold


fields, and on the roads, 280,000 ounces: grand general total of the
yield of the Victoria gold fields at the end of August, 2,532,422 ounces ;
or, 105 tons, 10 cwt., and 2 oz. of gold. The gold exported since
October last represents a value of �8, 863,477. These astounding re-
sults have been obtained by unskilled labourers, working without
either plan or concert. ? Science,? says the Argus, has done little or
nothing for us. Our processes in obtaining gold are of the rudest na-
ture. The search is characterized almost solely by what the sailors
call ? sheer strength and stupidity.? ?
