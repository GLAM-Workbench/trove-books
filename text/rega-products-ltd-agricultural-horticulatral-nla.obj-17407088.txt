INTRODUCTION
In presenting our Catalogue to the trade, we wish to say that we are well
aware that the progress we have made, and the ever growing popularity of
"Rega" products is not the result of our unaided efforts, but is due in no incon-
siderable measure to the confidence which our customers placed in us, and also
the generous patronage which the trade and the public at large have given us.
For this co-operation, mutually advantageous, we believe, we hereby express cur
thanks to our customers.
Standing face to face with the future with perfect confidence, we ask all our
numerous old customers for a continued share of their business, and we cordially
invite new business also.
THE "REGA" CREED.
It is an invariable rule of ours to make everything of the best material and in the
best form and never to lower the guality of our goods. From the very beginning
we have improved our designs wherever it seemed possible, and have never
allowed the quality to depreciate. No prospect of increased profit has caused
us to swerve from the determination to offer as good equipment each year, as
we have ever made before, or better. We intend this to be perpetual.
THAT YOU MAY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
OF "REGA" PRODUCTS.
Because much of what enters into the making of "Rega" products is not easily
apparent to the eye, we feel that a word here is not amiss. Care begins with the
material itself. To this is added careful selection and inspection. It may mean
nothing to many what goes into the scrap pile; or that clean, true material, a
little heavier than necessary, has been used, or that Copper or Brass not visible
to the eye were used in place of cheaper materials. All these may not show up
at first glance, but become more apparent during the years of service. The
"Rega" Creed is your safeguard.
Guarantee
We guarantee our goods and undertake to credit or replace, at our option, any
article which in our opinion is of faulty manufacture, or made of faulty materials,
providing complaint is made within three months after delivery. Our liability is
limited to replacing such articles free of charge, and no allowance can be made
for labour, transport charges, or any consequential expenses incurred.
Goods returned without freight being prepaid, will be refused, and will remain
with carriers at senders' risk and expense.
IMPROVEMENTS.
We are constantly improving our products both in design and construction, which
may result in pumps received differing slightly from the illustrations in this Cata-
logue. The illustrations and sketches are not binding in detail. We reserve the
right to improve and alter models as research and experience suggests or dictates.
We carry large stocks of "Rega" products in raw materials and finished stock
and invariably effect immediate despatch.
Upon request, as far as circumstances permit, we will gladly supply stereos of
any illustration in this Catalogue. We make no charge for this service.
The binding of this Catalogue permits further pages to be added, and such pages
will be forwarded to you as new productions appear,


Note.
Please do not deface or cut any of the illustrations in this Catalogue. Upon
request, any or all of the printed matter, or illustrations, will be freely supplied.

To most of our Pumps and Spare Parts Lists, we have given code words and serial
numbers. To avoid unnecessary delay and to simplify our understanding of your
requirements, please make use of such code words and serial numbers. With
many orders received by us, our powers of ingenuity and imagination are taxed
to the utmost, all because buyers have not used aur code words and serial
numbers.

T
AHE modern factory shown above was erected in 1937 to house
the evergrowing activities of "Rega" Products,
Covering approximately two acres it is situated close to the City
and shipping wharves and is connected to them by two splendid
concrete roads.
The main consideration of the modem factory is the planning for an
easy and uninterrupted flow of production and this has been
achieved in a remarkable way in these new premises where the
very latest machinery and eguipment has been installed. A good
supply of natural light is essential to first class workmanship and
to ensure this, particular care was taken in the erection of the
factory?even in winter the use of artificial light is unnecessary.
The building is an expansive and handsome structure, the exterior
being carried out in Brown Toned Texture bricks surmounted by
Fluted Stone Work.
A sawtooth roof supported by fabricated steel work is another
modern feature and the comfort of the employees has not been
neglected as Dining Rooms, Change Rooms, Ambulance Room,
Showers and Washing Troughs have been liberally provided.
Green lawns and shrubs make the surroundings pleasant and
enhance the appearance of the building.
Enlightened opinion is that modern and attractive premises have
a very definite appeal both to worker and buyer because each
unconsciously feels that a good, reliable article must issue from
and be the product of a well planned model factory.

INSTANT hi RELEASE
BARREL JiUPLATE
"REGA" No. 2 Barrel Sprayer
Built to the usual "Rega" high standard of quality under the maker's well-known guarantee, i.e?
life-long service, fair wear and tear excepted.
Faithful attention has been given to every detail which governs apparatus for the purpose of
spraying liquids.
Only those features which time and test proved invaluable to a first-class machine have been
incorporated in the "Rega? Barrel Sprayer. Simplicity of design, based on sound engineering
construction principles, marked our course in the preparation of this "Rega" Product.
The chief essentials in a Barrel Sprayer are a good pump, easy to get at, with a properly designed
plunger. High compression valves capable of withstanding the hard work valves have to do. A
strong Air Chamber with ample space and elasticity to hold sufficient liquid to keep two lines of
hose going, without exertion; an Agitator which can be used independent of the pump for thoroughly
mixing the solution before it is sprayed, and the whole machine handy to handle in and out of the
barrel. All these important features are incorporated in the "Rega" Barrel Sprayer.
In addition, we have adopted as standard equipment a very clever and ingenious instant Release
Plate (see illustration) for fitting to the barrel. By simply raising the small eccentric lever the
Spray Pump is released, which can then be taken from the barrel without unscrewing any bolts or
nuts. The opening is Sin. x sin., which is very large and convenient for cleaning and filling; a
template is sent out with each one for marking off the hole to be cut in the 45 gallon barrel when
supplied without barrel.
The Plunger and Agitator Rods are made from steel. The Valve Chamber, Valves, Pump Cylinder,
Plunger, Strainer, and Discharge Tube Connections are either brass or hard gunmetal; other parts
are iron and steel.
The Plunger, of all parts, having the hardest wear, and therefore the first thing to get out of
order, has had our special care in designing what we believe to be the most lasting and efficient
plunger ever fitted into a pump of this kind. A high pressure combination piston of high quality-
block leather, with Cotton follower, guaranteed to function after excessive wear (an importan.
feature) is fitted.
Barrel pumps are often laid aside between spraying seasons allowing the Plunger leathers to
shrink with a consequent loss of pressure until the leathers again become
wet and swollen.
In the "Rega" type of piston the Cotton follower (which does not shrink)
takes care of the pressure until the Plunger leather becomes wet and
icus-cro uuic '-'j. - -j ,
swollen, permitting it to resume normal functioning. Sometimes grit and
dirt will so impair the efficiency of a Plunger leather that it will not
function; under such circumstances the Cotton follower is invaluable, as
it ensures that the Pump will function until a new leather plunger is fitted.
One of the most important features of a spraying machine of this type is
the AGITATOR or MIXER. For satisfactory results liquids must be thor-
oughly mixed before commencing to apply them, and agitated during
spraying operations. Unless the Agitator can be worked independent of
the Pump, the first application will not be properly mixed. You can readily
understand that if the Agitator is a fixed unit with the pump the two will
work together and the first suctions of the pump will be unmixed and
partly mixed spraying solution, with obvious results to the foliage of the
trees and the fruit itself; and, in general, imperfect work. Exactly the
same thing happens if the spraying operations are restea. Very few spray-
ing preparations can be held in solution indefinitely, therefore, those in-
gredients which fall to the bottom of the barrel are drawn into the pump
and block the ways of the machine, apart from other dangers previously
referred to.
The "Rega" Pump Plunger Rod is connected to the Lever Handle by a
CENTRE PIN which can be withdrawn, leaving the Pump at rest until the
liquid is thoroughly mixed; then the Pin can be instantly inserted and the
Pump brought into operation. This important feature should appeal to your
good judgment.
The handle is drilled for three selective positions of the Plunger Rod Centre
Pin, allowing for three different stroke lengths of the Pump, according to
the number of nozzles being used. The machine is built for two hoses and will maintain our
nozzles at high pressure.

/I " High Compression Knapsack
Sprayer
(MOLE'S PATENT)
In the "Rega" Pumping System, surplus liquid above the plunger is returned to the Container
by the following ingenious patent:
In the Pump Cylinder a liquid return way is made into the Container through the
top connecting bracket. Screwed therein is the Liquid Return Shoulder Piece, No. 44, into which
is screwed the Liquid Return Tube and Valve, No. 48. This prevents liquid waste and over-
comes the disagreeable wetting of the operator's clothing.
The parallel Motion Lever imparts extraordinary power to the Pump with the minimum of
effort, which necessitates the fitting of High Compression Valves and a solid-drawn brass tube
Air Chamber. Spraying mixtures are applied in cloud form by means of tho enormous pressure
obtained in the combination.
THE VALVES.
The Valves, Pump Inlet, and Air Chamber Compression are made from solid brass, of the
poppet type, with ground-in seats. A light coiled Valve Spring is used for quick closing.
No trouble will be experienced if ordinary care is taken to keep the Valves clean. After use
the container should be filled with clean water and pumped through the system. To save time,
take off Nozzle and give the pipe full bore.
WARNING.
Complaints have been made of collapsed containers. This is due to vacuum created by
clogging of vent-holes. Spraying mixtures containing soaps, fats, or similar adhesive agents
should be heated to blood heat at least. If used cold, loosen Drain Screw Plug on Container
Shoulder and clean out machine with warm water after use.
LOSS OF PRESSURE.
Generally caused through Valve trouble. Take them out and clean seats. The Valve Chambers
are get-at-able, and easily inspected.
At the bottom of Pump and Air Chamber are caps with two pins on each. Take the special
Combination Key supplied with machine, place loop over pins and unscrew. On the pump side
it will be necessary to drop lever by taking out the one bolt which passes through the vertical
Connecting Rod.
With Caps off, the Valves are in view; insert the two prongs of key in the Valve Slots, and
unscrew anti-clockwise, inspect, clean and replace.
SPECIAL CARE.
Keep all moving parts well oiled.
Oil Plug of Stop Cock occasionally.
After use, pump clean water through machine.
After using corrosive liquids or mixtures containing soaps, fats, or similar mixtures, clean
well with hot water.
All parts of the "Rega" Knapsack Sprayers are standardised, and spares can be obtained
through all good hardware stores.
THE NOZZLE.
The "Rega" Double Cyclone Nozzle, No. 3, is standard equipment (or the Combination
Bordeaux-Cyclone?Mole's Patent ?if preferred). The joints are movable, and can be swivelled
to any angle. Invaluable for spraying two rows at the one time, underneath leaves, or down
into the hearts of plants.
THE PUMP.
Is very powerful. Solid drawn Brass Cylinder, Sin. x 1 2 im* with stroke. Designed with
Mole's Patent Air-Lock Tube and Stuffing Box combined, and Liquid Return System.

UNSOLICITED TESTIMONIAL,
Here is an extract from a letter received, ''During the recent blight I was the only one using
the 'Rega' Mole's Patent Knapsack; my crops only were saved, all the others were entirely
wiped out. I attribute my success to the powerful pump atomizing the spray mixture so fine
as to reach every part of the plant. Bacteria blight can penetrate through an opening smaller
than a needle's point.''

Liquid Capacity 3 Gals., Weight 15 lbs.
The pumping action in this type of Knapsack is obtained by means of an
oscillating crank and connecting rod fixed in the centre of a cupped rubber
diaphragm.
THE NOZZLE
The "Rega" Double Cyclone Nozzle, No. 3, is standard equipment (or the
Combination Bordeaux-Cyclone?Mole's Patent ?if preferred). The joints are
movable, and can be swivelled to any angle. Invaluable for spraying two
rows at one time, underneath leaves, or down into the hearts of plants.
Supplied complete as illustrated. Liquid tight lid. Strainer, 2ft. Lance, 4ft.
3-ply Hose armoured one end. Leather Straps. Double Swivel Cyclone
Nozzle No. 3 will spray in any direction.
SPECIAL FEATURE
The Air Chamber inside Container (No. 32) of the "Rega" Diaphragm Knap-
sack is detachable and can be unscrewed and withdrawn through filling
opening on top of machine. Users of old models will especially appreciate
this improvement.
"'REGA" Patent One-Piece Handle Crankshaft
Now Standard Equipment
Patent applied for No. 13286/33.
At long last the difficulties attending spraying operations among vines and
closely grown crops with the standard machine have been eliminated. With
the "Rega" Patent Machine there is no danger of vines and branches being
torn away from trellis by catching on to the projecting nut of shaft. The outlet
also is directed forward. No handle to work loose or nut to come off.
VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE
"Rega" Knapsacks are brass throughout at no extra cost. COPPER IS UNSUITABLE for lime
sulphur and preparations based on liver of sulphur, and corrode very quickly.

screws from Metal Collar of Air Chamber, No. 35/36. Without unscrewing
anything else, the Metal Collar and the Crankshaft, with the Rubber Dia-
phragm, can be removed, and the Valve Chamber exposed.
When renewing Rubber Diaphragm, No. 41, be careful to re-assemble Nos,
54 and 55 Metal Discs with Convex Sides against the Rubber Diaphragm, as
illustrated below. All parts must be screwed up tightly.

SPECIAL CARE
Keep all moving parts well oiled.
Oil Plug of Hose Cock occasionally.
After use, pump clean water through machine.
After using corrosive liquids or mixtures containing soaps, fats, or similar
mixtures, clean well with hot water.
All parts of the "Rega" Diaphragm Knapsack sprayers are standardised, and
spares can be obtained through all good hardware stores.
WARNING
Complaints have been made of collapsed containers. This is due to vacuum
created by clogging of vent-holes. Spraying mixtures containing soaps, fats,
or similar adhesive agents should be heated to blood heat at least. If used
cold, loosen Drain Screw Plug on Container Shoulder and clean out machine
with warm water after use.
CAUTION
As quite a number of the ready made spraying solutions offered to-day
contain corrosive agents we strongly advise users of "Rega" Knapsacks
(especially when they do not know the analysis of the spraying solutions
they may be using) to always use our Lead Coaled Machines.

WARNING
No guarantee is expressed or implied against liquids used in the machine.
Arsenate Pentoxide, and liquids containing Acids, Ammonia, and the like
MUST always be used in the Lead Coated Machine.
CAUTION
As quite a number of the ready made Spraying Solutions offered to-day contain corrosive
agents we strongly advise users of "Rega" Knapsacks (especially when they do not know
the analysis of the Spraying Solutions they may be using) to always use Our Lead Coated
Machines.
IMPORTANT
The containers are tested to 60 lbs., gauge glass pressure, and will not
burst under proper treatment.
Sufficient pressure can be obtained by the use of one arm pumping. It
is unnecessary to put the whole weight of the body into the operation and
risk damaging pump rod and a burst cylinder.
ADVICE
Loss of pressure is due to faulty valve at foot of pump or locking device
not screwed down on rubber gasket.

A Perfect Combination.
No wonder all Gardeners Pre-
fer "Rega" Quality.
These types of "Rega" Bucket
Pumps are fitted with the
"Rega" Airlock Air Chamber
as illustrated.
High
The "Rega" Air-Lock Air Chamber is a unique feature. Some years ago the patentee of the
"Rega" system of atomization took up the study of this class of pump; exhaustive experiments
and tests were made covering each integral part: size and shape of air chamber: air force
and elasticity: air retaining; kind, shape, and size of valves and valve ways: relativity of the
two air retainers, handle air tube and air chamber in combination with the stuffing box factor.
The result was a spray pump superior to anything ever before and ever sine� the specification
has remained unaltered. Note the air recess above the airlock tube which is designed in union
with the stuffing box to hold compression.
The function of an air chamber is to give elasticity to the liquid stream and cushion it to flow
evenly at all pressures.
Water being incompressible for practical purposes, the size, shape and construction of the
air chamber is very important. Force is produced by confining the liquid and reducing the air
cushion. Keep the stuffing cap on top of the air chamber screwed down on to the packing.
Oil occasionally. A leaking stuffing box weakens the pump.

pump for the man who desires larger volume and elasticity.
MODEL A
is the Favourite. Filling all the requirements of a first-class Sprayer, it is suitable for all-

The "REGA" Under-Arm Sprayers
The "Rega" Under-arm must not be classed with other makes of like kind.
We have made several important improvements, chiefly to the stuffing box,
which has been enlarged and scientifically constructed to give the better
service and drip prevention.
Made entirely of Brass, it works on the same principle as the ''Rega'' Models
Al, A, B, and D, but in practice the liquid passes through the handle without
an air chamber and generates a high pressure up to 200 lbs.
It is double acting, having two valves which can be easily cleaned if neces-
sary.
This type of Bucket Spray Pump operates by inserting the Foot Valve at
end of pipe extension in a bucket and grasping the bottom wood handle
in the left hand, or under arm; move the top handle up and down with the
right hand like a trombone.
It is equipped with a special cyclone nozzle. A solid stream insert is supplied
to replace whirl disc for washing windows, autos, etc.
THE "REGA"
This improved PATENT Under-arm Sprayer is scienti-
fically constructed with an Air-Chamber instead of
the usual wooden handle.
This nozzle

Our well-known standard Model Under-arm Sprayer,

unbroken spray which stops instantly when pumping
ceases. For some purposes this is best, but becomes

Pumps.
The Air-Chamber model enables the operator to make long, steady strokes
with the greatest ease.
The Air in the Air-Chamber is compressed at every movement of the pump,
storing up energy to give elasticity to the liquid stream and cushion it to
flow evenly at all pressures.

CODE: Cylpump
This New "Rega" Product is not an ordinary Bucket Pump such as you have been used to.
It differs in principle and construction from the well-known "Rega" Models Al, A, B, and D.
Instead of the usual pear-shaped Air Chamber, it has a large Air Cylinder, 14 inch by 3|
inch diameter, in which a large quantity of liquid can be stored up under pressure and dis-
charged at will without pumping.
The Pump, 18 inch by lj inch diameter, is a very powerful and single action one built into the
cylinder. The valves are solid brass, ground-in to high compression standard.
The Compression Valve is easily removed in case of trouble, by unscrewing the inspection
cover of valve housing at bottom of cylinder.
SPECIAL FEATURE
No energy required on the upward stroke of pump. The liquid flows into pump by atmospheric
pressure and is forced into?the cylinder on the downward stroke, making pumping easy, natural
and untiring.
By use of the stop cock, spraying operations can be carried on at will, and moved from place
to place until the stored up pressure is exhausted. Fully pumped, it will discharge a fine spray
for one minute. An occasional pump will keep up pressure.

Leakless Autopop Instant Cut-off Valve
The object of this new "Rega" patent is to open and close the
valve without the objectionable and sometimes dangerous leaking
of the liquid through the use of a stuffing box of any kind.
The patent consists of a diaphragm, or pulsator, interposed be-
tween the valve lifter and the oscillator, thereby effecting the
opening and closing of the Valve without the possibility of the
liquid escaping.
The Valve is fitted with a Rubber Insertion Diaphragm for general
use. A spare R.I. Diaphragm is sent out with each Valve and a
metal one for use with Oil.
In emergencies a home-made leather one can be cut and used.
(Patent No. 23193/35)
To assist users in a breakdown on the job, late models are fitted with a stuffing box, which can be
tightened up and brought into use until another Diaphragm is fitted.
You are advised to carry spare Diaphragms of the kind mostly in use.
Under actual test the metal Diaphragm, for use with oil, gave way after 6,000 pulsations. The
Rubber Insertion Diaphragm showed little signs of wear after 8,000 pulsations.

THE ADVANTAGES OF WHITEWASHING
Properly made and applied, whitewash is a preservative and a disinfectant. It diffuses a
soft light, kills vermin, and promotes sanitation in general. Poultry houses, stock barns, cellars,
outbuildings, fences, factory interiors and exteriors can be greatly improved and their value
much enhanced, by a liberal coat of the wash.
Especially is this true of old cellars and warehouses, which have fallen into disuse on
account of their musty odor and dingy, uninviting appearance. One coat, applied at very
small expense, will change entirely this condition and render such places as good as new.
Lime costs but little and the water to mix it costs less. You can get substantial returns for an
investment of practically nothing.
BEST METHOD OF APPLICATION
In the past it has always been a disagreeable, sloppy undertaking?applying whitewash with
a brush. Part of it trickled down the operator?s arms, part of it went on the floor, and the
slender remainder was rubbed on over the recesses in the walls and ceilings not in them
where it must go to be absolutely effective ?100% efficient.
With a "Rega" Spray Pump it is vastly different. The wash is discharged from a nozzle
directly upon the place to be covered ?and is driven at a high pressure?penetrating every
crack and crevice, filling up the uneven places with a perfect disinfectant. The progress of the
work can be traced by the pure, white, uniform coat, free from brush marks, and resembling
white enamel in its smoothness. There is small chance for germs or vermin to thrive after
a "Rega" whitewasher has been at work. No ladder climbing ?no reaching, and with ordin-
ary care, no splashing the wash on one's clothes.
WHY "REGA" SPRAYERS SHOULD BE USED
In a successful whitewashing outfit, these two things are essential: Large open valves that
will freely pass the liquid, and a nozzle that will not clog. "Rega" sprayers answer all these
requirements in every way. They have brass valves ?brass cylinders in fact all working
parts are brass ?suitable for applying whitewash and other noncorrosive liquids.
The Bordeaux nozzle, furnished with our whitewashing outfits, is made entirely of brass and
gives a wide fan-shaped spray which can be made coarse or changed to a solid stream by
turning the nozzle handle. The only proved satisfactory nozzle for the purpose.
If you have whitewashing to do, fruit and flowers to spray, gardens to be sprinkled, windows,
buggies and autos to wash, etc., by all means get a "Rega" Sprayer. They last for years, cost
but little and give unqualified satisfaction to every owner.
FORMULA FOR WHITEWASH
Eighteen pounds of unslacked lime, slack in warm water, cover it during the process to keep
in the steam: strain the liquid through a fine sieve or strainer; add 8 lbs. of salt previously well
dissolved in warm water, 3 lbs. of ground rice boiled to a thin paste and stirred in boiling
hot; i lb. of powdered whiting and 1 lb. of glue which has been previously dissolved over a
slow fire. Add 6 gallons hot water in the mixture, stir well and let it stand for a few days,
covered from the dirt. Strain carefully and apply with a "Rega" Spray Pump. It should be put
on hot. Greater or smaller quantities of Limewash can be prepared by regulating the
quantities, likewise colouring matter may be added for any shade desired.
The above formula is as used on Government Forts and Lighthouses, and is one we can
recommend.
LIME WASH FOR WHITE-WASHING
Only good, thoroughly burnt quicklime should be used. Place it in a tub and slake by
sprinkling a little water over it ?not more than lime can readily absorb. When the lime has
become a fine dry powder, add to each part a half part of whitening. Then dilute until the
correct consistency is obtained, say about the thickness of cream. This can be proved by
dipping in a stick to which the mixture should just adhere. Strain lime wash before use.

DUST Sprayer
The most powerful One-man DUSTER
built to-day.
Designed and Constructed to give perfect
satisfaction.
Capacity, 15 pounds. Weight, 18 pounds
Equipment: Two 12in. Extension Tubes
and Spoon Spreader for ground work; lin.
x 2ft. Sin. Wire-wound Air Hose, that will
not kink, crack, or break.
The "REGA" Knapsack Dust
Sprayer
is a force-fed machine. The 600-cubic inch bellows
capacity develops a most powerful drive, making it
possible to reach high trees or cover wide areas on
ground work.
The bellows are not hinged; the diaphragm is specially constructed to move with the entire
length of stroke, ensuring positive and instant control; the slightest movement serves to control
the dust at operator's will, saving time and material.
The intermittent blast puts the dust where and when you want on spot dusting, with no loss
of material between plants, and a continuous flow is easily accomplished by a sweeping
motion of the nozzle as the operator walks along.
The feed, or discharge, is simple and effective?can be regulated for a wide range of action,
from a very thin, vapoury dust to a dense cloud. The measurement of discharge is accurate
and constant.
The sifting device crushes lumps and force-feeds the dust through a fine screen, so that the
discharged dust floats in the air. No lumps are passed. No waste material will be found
falling on the ground between machine and plant or tree.
Dust is sifted only into moving air. It never falls to bottom of airway, therefore no clogging.
It will satisfactorily handle heavy nicotine-sulphur dusts, or other moist materials that are not
thoroughly dry.
The Airway is constructed to set up a cyclonic action, which breaks up and mixes the dust
particles as they are ground through the fine sifting screen, resulting in a perfect cloud of very
fine dust, which clings perfectly to every part of the tree, plant, or vine surface.
The power and force of the blast drives the dust to every crevice and tightly curled leaves
and will drive the cloud to a distance of 20 to 25 feet from the nozzle end.
Every machine is packed in a strong wooden case with full instructions how to set up, care
of machine, etc.
All working parts standardised and obtainable through all good hardware stores.

"REGA" Large Tin Hand Atomizer
(Patent No. 12804/28)
The "REGA" large tin Atomizer is a great
favorite for use in the garden and about the
house in many ways where a large capacity
is required. Suitable for Horticultural Sprays,
Insecticides and the like, liquid waxes, etc.
Well made, it combines strength, simplicity
and neatness in its design and construction.
The end of pump is cone shaped, which serves to contract the air force gradually and with
great power, thus creating enormous velocity of suction as the air passes over the top of the
liquid lube. The pump cone passes through the top of the tank, and is firmly soldered, making
a very strong reliable article.
A special feature is the "REGA" Funnel Filler Cap. You know the usual messy, wasteful job
of pouring into the old-fashioned screw cap. Note the "REGA" way, and buy the service
offered you.

Instructions for Renewing the Leathers
A complete set of spare Leathers is supplied with each Pump. When
the Leathers in the Pump become worn, and it is necessary to replace, the
following method is recommended:
To Dissemble
Take off Hose, Handle, and Foot Inlet Valve 29. Screw off Top Cap 5, which
contains parts 6, 7, and Spring wound 8, which is an important unit. Hold
Foot Casting in Vyce, carefully, for fear of distorting threads; unscrew, and
draw off the Cylinder.
You can now inspect the whole Plunger Leather assembly. Take apart
the Plunger Leather Assembly, which consists of parts 25; 19; 20; 24 with
Spring; 21; and 15; and slide off |in. Plunger Cylinder. Remove Knurled
Cap 18; and Cupped Plunger Leather 17; being careful about the Ball Valve
and Spring inside the Knurled Cap. Unscrew and take off Backnut 16,
and slide off Assembly. Before reassembling, examine fin. Stuffing Box
Gland Leather 24, located between 20 and 21.


Trade Mark
Quadruple Tyre Pump
With the purchase of the Rega Quadruple Pump you have possessed
yourself with the best article of its kind sold anywhere in the world.
Improvements have been made on certain parts that will be appreciated by
anyone familiar with this type of pump.
Designed for quick and easy inflation of pneumatic tyres, it is, strictly
speaking, a two-stage reduction principle Pump, taking its name of
Quadruple, we suppose, from the fact that four strokes are needed to com-
plete the two stages of compression.
The principle employed is to compress the air in the large cylinder
into the intermediate |in. tube on the first stroke, and this again into the
small fin. tube on the second stroke, which, on each successive stroke of
the Pump, is discharged into the tyre.
The "Rega" "Ezeflo" Thumlock Adaptor is standard equipment, which
opens the tyre Valve when attached, and saves pumping against the Valve
Spring, thereby saving considerable energy, and strain on the Pump.
REMARKS
It is essential that all parts be firmly screwed together, and no creases or
wrinkles in the moulded leathers, if the Pump is to operate satisfactorily.
See that all the joints have Washers between, to keep the Pump airtight.
IMPORTANT
Oil occasionally with any kind of animal or vegetable oil. Neatsfoot, Olive
or Cod fish oils preferred. Do not use lubricating oils to Leathers. Attention
to this will prevent wear, and prolong the' life of the Pump.

This Pump is specially designed for the Balloon Tyre. It is a volume
rather than a pressure tyre pump, and is so constructed as to give
the comparatively low pressure required speedily?and with the least
possible exertion.
The special feature of the "Rega" Dual Balloon Pump?and on which
alike its efficiency and ease of operation depend?is the introduction of
a second chamber in addition to the main pumping cylinder.
This auxiliary cylinder acting as a reservoir, obviates the necessity for super-compression at
the end of the down stroke, as required when air is passed directly from pumping cylinder to
tyre through small apertures in flexible tube and tyre valve.
This form of construction permits the use of a cylinder of far greeter capacity than w*puld
otherwise be possible and is responsible for reducing exertion to a minimum.

?(Dead? Utility Hand-Power Spraying
Outfit MODEL l Pa;*m
A low-priced Portable Spraying Unit, scientifically designed.
Simple in construction. Easy to operate. Efficient and quickest
way to apply all kinds of liquids to all kinds of surfaces.
Suitable for Lacquers, Paints, Enamels, Bronzes, Stains, Horticul-
tural Sprays, Oils, Disinfectants, Insecticides, Germicides, and the
like.
The efficiency
large, depends
of any Spray-finishing Outfit, whether small or
almost entirely upon the Spray Gun.
The "Rega" Spray Gun is adjustable to the finest degree, vertical
and horizontal, by means of two Regulators which operate on the
Air Supply Pipe. The Fluid Nozzle is a fixture which you will
appreciate if you have used the adjustable type. When first
adjustments are being made a certain amount of fluid generally
gathers around the Nozzle and clogs the adjustment. The "Rega"
invention eradicates all those disadvantages.
Model S Utility Spraying Outfit differs from the Model L in that the Air Container is smaller
with a self-enclosed pump. (Spray Pistol in Both models is the same.)

Engines kerosened, etc.
A gentle pressure on the Air Valve Button produces a fine mist spray,
smooth and uniform in coating. This perfect Atomization reduces sanding
and rubbing down time to a minimum on first class work, and on ordinary
jobs it leaves the surface all that could be desired with one application only.
Can be obtained as a separate unit, as above, or with the complete Spraying

Wound Syringes
Cows will frequently injure a quarter by
bruising it. This will generally cause the
milk to become thick and stringy, and
unless this is withdrawn from the udder,
garget or hardening of the quarter will set in, with the ultimate loss of that quarter.
Every Farmer should keep a modern Teat Syringe. It is indispensable when a Teat or Quarter
has to be cleaned out with an antiseptic solution. Spare rubber bulbs, if required.
Milking Tube
For draining milk off when teats are sore or
obstructed.
