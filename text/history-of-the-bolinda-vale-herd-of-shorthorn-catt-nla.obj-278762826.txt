The Bolinda Vale Herd of Shorthorn Cattle
■jJUI HEN the late Sir W. J. Clarke determined to
111 found a herd of stud shorthorn cattle at his
Bolinda Vale estate he commissioned his
manager, Mr. Robert Clarke, to buy the very
best animals he could procure, regardless of
the cost. Mr. Clarke, who is an enthusiast in the. breed
and an ardent student of the principles of breeding, deter-
mined that the Summerton tribe, which is descended from
that fine old pillar of Victorian shorthorns—viz., Roan
Summerton (imported)—would be the family that he
would select from. Looking now at the result of his
judgment, it will be admitted that he made a wise and
satisfactory choice, for the position the herd occupies at
the present time is second to none in the Southern
Hemisphere, proved by the honours they take in the show-
ring of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria, and
also by the high prices the stock make, both by auction
and private sale, whenever, they are submitted.
The characteristics aimed at have been uniformity
of type, broad, deep-framed, short-legged, heavily and
mellow-fleshed animals, full of quality and symmetry, and
carrying coats of rich mossy hair.
Upon the death of his father the herd descended to
Sir Rupert T. H. Clarke, who has continued it on the
same lines, and no expense is spared to obtain the very
best sires procurable. The herd now contains 140 stud
females, all of whom, with the exception of the few that
are annually shown, are run out in the well-grassed
paddocks of the estate, and in consequence of this natural
treatment their constitutions are strong and disease is
almost unknown. The dams suckle their calves, and
always have ample milk for them, and if the herd was
treated on dairy lines the results, without doubt, would
be very satisfactory, as they possess all the qualities of
excellent milkers.

The first purchase for the Stud Herd was made at
Messrs. Robertson Bros.’ sale, at Colac, on 4th January,
1878, when Oxford Summerton was bought by auction
for 1,600 guineas. This well-known cow was bred by
the late Mr. Richard Morton, and was included in the
celebrated sale of the 27 Skelsmergh Hall shorthorns to
Messrs. Robertson Bros, for £37,000. Mr. John James,
who was their herdsman at that time, had a very high
opinion of her, and it was against his wish that she was
included in the annual sale. She was a most successful
prize-taker, and her record is eight champion, one grand
champion, thirteen first, one second, and one third prizes.
She was also an excellent breeder, producing four bulls
(three of which were used in the herd) and three heifers,
and her descendants now total to 63 bulls and 46 females.
Her pedigree is as follows :
(Note. —In the following pedigrees the numbers refer to Coates’s Herd Book,
unless otherwise mentioned).

OXFORD’S SUMMERTON at 2 years.
[See page' f.


Oxford’s Summerton was a very stylish cow, with a
grand outlook, and very active. She had a fine constitu-
tion, and her whole appearance was very symmetrical.
Her head and neck were simply perfect, shoulders well set
back, points of shoulders good, setting well into the neck,
fore and hind flanks very good. She had a great body,
well sprung ribs, and was extra thick through the heart;
great loins and back. She teemed with quality, and was a
very mellow handler. There are very few shorthorns
without faults, but this cow was almost perfect.
At the Colac sale in January, 1879, two more stud
females were bought from Messrs. Bobertson Bros., viz..—
20th Duchess of Derrintut (see illustration), roan, calved Bth
April, 1877, bred by Messrs. Robertson Bros.; sire Oxford Cherry
Duke (32,016).

ggggggggggd by Marfleet’s Old Red Bull (1,192).
Frederick the Great (imported), by Frederick (14,571) ; dam Matilda (imported,
C. H. 8., vol. xiii., p, 726).
This heifer, purchased for 350 guineas, was very
highly thought of at Colac, and was acknowledged to
be one of the best bred there. She took seven first
and one second prizes as a one and two-year-old, and
had one bull and two heifer calves, and then had twins,
which had to be taken from her, causing her death—
a great loss to the herd. Her heifers bred well, and the
bull was one of the best bred at Belinda, and was
afterwards used on the herd cattle. The Argus contribu-
tor, in his report of the Colac sale, referring to 20th
Duchess of Derrimut, says :—“ The champion at Mel-
bourne and Geelong, which could possibly not be
equalled of her age in the colonies, has gone to enrich the
Belinda Vale herd at the modest sum of 350 guineas.”
The descendants of 20th Duchess of Derrimut now
number 36 bulls and 48 females.
The other purchase was for 300 guineas, and her
pedigree is as follows :
16th Duchess of white, calved 7th February, 1876,
bred by Messrs, Robertson Bros.; sire Oxford Cherry Duke (32,016).

This cow was never shown, but was a splendid
breeder, having had four bulls and six heifers, and all of
her daughters turned out as good as the mother in that
respect. One of them was a high-class show cow, Bolinda
Duchess of Derrimut 10th, who took seven first, seven
second, and one Derby prizes; and her daughter, Bolinda
Duchess of Derrimut 30th, took three champion, twelve
first, six second, and three third prizes. A son of the last-
named cow, viz., Bolinda Duke of Derrimut 40th, took
four champion and seven first prizes in 1891 and 1892,
including the champion prize at the Royal Agricultural
Society’s Show, Melbourne, 1891, when only 14 months
old, and at the same society’s show in 1892, when a two-
year-old, he was again awarded champion prize as the
best shorthorn bull in the yard, any age.
Bolinda Duke of Derrimut 40th w T as then sold
to the late Mr. A. M‘Hardy, of Hawke’s Bay, N.Z.,
for £5OO, who showed him in that colony, and he was
never beaten. He proved a great success in Mr.
M‘Hardy’s stud, and one of his sons, belonging to
Archdeacon Williams, of Te Aute, in 1900 beat all
comers wherever shown. Mr. Robert Clarke saw
this bull in New Zealand, and considered him likely to
prove a great sire. He was not big, but had a great body,
standing on short legs, splendid quality of flesh, rich
coat of hair, and was a very mellow handler. It is satis-
factory for a breeder to sell bulls to go into such good
herds as the late Mr. M‘Hardy’s and Archdeacon
Williams’s, as it gives the animal a chance to reproduce
himself, and in this instance Bolinda Duke of Derrimut
40th has certainly done so.
The descendants of 16th Duchess of Derrimut now
number 65 bulls and 93 heifers.
Two more females were purchased privately in Octo-
ber, 1879, from Messrs. Robertson Bros., viz. :
23rd Duchess of Derrirtiut, red and white, calved 13th July,
1877, bred by Messrs. Robertson Bros,; sire Earl of Geneva
(31,068).

20th DUCHESS OF DERRIMUT at 20 months old.
[See page 3.


Price paid, 300 guineas. This was a plain cow, very
heavily fleshed, possessing a great constitution, and turned
out a splendid breeder. She was, when bought, in calf to
Oxford Duke of Cambridge 2nd, a Red Rose bull, pur-
chased by Messrs. Robertson Bros, for 1,000 guineas, and
this calf was the first Belinda Duchess of Derrimut, and
she produced, when mated with 36th Duke of Derrimut,
that well-known cow Belinda Duchess of Derrimut Bth,
one of the best if not the best cow Australia has yet seen.
From 1884 to 1890 she was awarded twelve champion,
seventeen first, six second, and two third prizes; one of the
latter was when a yearling, and the other when old and
out of condition.
The dam of 23rd Duchess of Derrimut, Grand
Duchess of Derrimut, was a fine-framed cow, very even
fleshed, a good handler, with plenty of hair, and was
the dam of a number of extra good bulls, amongst them
being 17th Duke of Derrimut, purchased by Messrs. C.
and A. Finlay, at Colac sale, 1876, for 850 guineas.
23rd Duchess of Derrimut is also the g. granddam
of Bolinda Duchess of Derrimut 75th, a great prize-
taker, having been shown since 1892, when eight months
old, up to 1901, at ten years old, and has won six champion,
nine first, three second, and one third prizes, and also one
of a winning group three times. Although she is eleven
years old she is about at her best now—a characteristic
of the Summerton tribe being that if well fed they will
come to early maturity or will improve up to eight or
ten years old with fair treatment.
The descendants of 23rd Duchess of Derrimut now
number 112 bulls and 114 females.
The other private purchase was :
21st Duchess of Derriniut, roan, calved 23rd April, 1877,
bred by Messrs. Robertson Bros.; sire Earl of Geneva (31,068).

This cow only produced three bulls, which were used
in the unpedigreed herd.
The foregoing five cows were the foundation stock of
the stud herd, which now numbers 140 females.

Her bull calf of 1889 was shown at the Royal Agri-
cultural Society’s Show, Melbourne, that year, when only
six months old, and was awarded first prize, and was
afterwards sold for 500 guineas to Messrs. Black Bros.,
Mt. Noorat.
The foregoing list of high honours gained by Belinda
Duchess of Derrimut Bth proves her to have been one of
the best cows ever seen in Australia. She had a great
constitution, and was a good thriver. A characteristic
feature of the whole of her family is the way they
always maintain their condition, even in the worst
seasons. This fine cow had a grand head and neck,
shoulders well set back, shoulder points set well into
her neck, back short and strong, her hind-quarters
coming well forward, both fore and hind flanks well let
down, giving her a very straight under line. . She stood
on short legs, but covered a lot of ground, and, like all
the descendants of old Roan Summerton (imported), she
had fine bone. Her live weight at six years old was
1,800 lbs.

Belinda Duchess of Derrimut 10th was not beaten
until she met her herd companion, Bolinda Duchess of
Derrimut 8 th, in the cow class, at the Royal Show,
Melbourne, in 1888, when she was placed second, and
they were placed this way until the Grand National Show
at Traralgon, when she was awarded first, and her
companion second. Mr. Robert Clarke agreed with the
judgment on the latter occasion, as he always considered
her the better of the two cows—in fact, the best ever
bred at Bolinda Vale. She was a long, lengthy, large
cow, with a perfect head, grand neck and shoulders, wide
thighs from the flank back, and great depth from the hip
bone to the hock, two points very essential in a good
shorthorn. She was very heavily covered with mellow
flesh, with a thick mossy coat of hair, a very fine handler,
and a constitution of the best.

Her daughter, Bolinda Duchess of Derrimut 173rd,
took second prize when 11 months old in the yearling
class at the Royal Show, Melbourne, 1899, and was
sold for 400 guineas; and another daughter, Bolinda
Duchess of Derrimut 191st, took first prize when 11
months old at the Royal Show, Melbourne, 1900, in
the yearling class, and first in 1901 in the two-year-old
class, and was also one of the prize-winning group, and
one of the second prize four by the one sire.
Bolinda Duchess of Derrimut 75th is now at her
best, although in her eleventh year, and carries her ninth
calf, yet she retains her marvellous form exceedingly
well, and, considering she has been highly fed since a calf,
she is very active and a good traveller. She is thickly
covered with good solid flesh, her loins are very broad,
and her chine is worth going a long way to see. That
fine judge of a shorthorn, the late Mr. A. M‘Hardy,
of Hawke’s Bay, N.Z., greatly admired her, and on
returning to New Zealand he said that he had seen a
cow at Bolinda Vale that there was room to sleep on,
and later on, when he returned with one of his friends,
he said, when looking at her, u Now you can see for
yourself that I told you the truth.” Her fore-flank and
brisket are extra good, as also are her shoulder points and
neck veins. If this cow had not been so highly fed she
would have been an extraordinary milker, as even now
she milks well. Like the most of the Summertons she
is light in bone, although a mountain of flesh; and,
although she has had eight calves, her underline is as true
as in her younger days.

OXFORD’S SUMMERTON 7th at 16 years


A very profitable cow. She is now 16 years old, and
just calved her twelfth calf, a fine red bull, very large and
strong, and looks like having two or three more calves
if she is taken care of. Oxford’s Summerton 27th, by
,36th Duke of Derrimut, dam Oxford’s Summerton 7th, was
sold to the late A. M‘Hardy, and at the Hawke’s Bay
Show in 1896 she was awarded first prize as two-year-old
heifer. At the same society’s show, 1897, she was awarded
first in the cow class and champion prize for the best
female, and her yearling bull was first in his class. She is
descended from Oxford’s Summerton, the champion cow,
purchased for 1,600 guineas.

Earl of Geneva (31,068), imported by the late Mr. Richard Morton, was a
very heavy, firm-fleshed bull, a good handler, with a grand constitution. Good
firm meat is what is required in a beef-producing animal. This fine bull was pur-
chased by Messrs. Robertson Bros, for 1,600 guineas, and at one of the Colac sales
bulls by him averaged £853 2s. 6d.

This bull was purchased by Messrs. Watt and
Thomson at auction for 600 guineas, and is out of that
grand cow 3rd Duchess of Derrirnut, also bred by the late
Mr. Richard Morton, and considered by him to be the
best cow he ever bred. She took first prize at the
Melbourne Show, 1874, the best show held up to then in
Victoria. She was of great length, with a grand head,
splendid flesh and hair, shoulder points and neck veins
perfect, thighs deep and wide—in fact, perfect in every
point, and a striking type of a shorthorn. Messrs.
Robertson Bros, valued this cow when she died at 2,000
guineas.

This bull was unfortunately only used in the stud
herd for a short time, as he got some of the best breeding
cows in it. One of his daughters, Oxford’s Summerton 7th,
is now over sixteen years old, and has had twelve
calves. He was then used in the non-pedigreed herd,
and some of his steers, sold when two years old, many
years back when cattle were cheap, made £8 17s. 6d.
in the fat market.

This hull was also used in the stud herd for some
time, and then turned out in the non-pedigreed herd to
make room for 36th Duke of Derrimut. Wetherby
Winsome 2nd (40,905) was selected by the late Mr.
Richard Morton for Messrs. Robertson Bros., Colac, and,
although not a perfect-framed bull, the quality of his
flesh was marvellous, and he left some extra good stock.

When on a visit to Messrs. Robertson Bros.’ estate,
Colac, Mr. Robert Clarke saw 17th Duchess of Derrimut,
and admired her so much that he told Mr. John James, the
herd manager, that if she ever had a bull calf he would
purchase him. Her next calf was 36th Duke of Derrimut,
and when six months old Mr. Clarke bought him for 350
guineas—a most successful purchase, as he lived to 14
years, and never got a bad calf. He got a great number of
prize-winners, amongst them being Belinda Duchesses of
Derrimut Bth and 10th, whose performances have been
previously recorded. The success of 36th Duke of
Derrimut is an illustration of the advisability of always
seeing both sire and dam when selecting a bull for stud
use.

This bull proved a very high-class sire. The dam of
the champion bull Belinda Duke of Derrimut 40th was by
him, and he is also sire of some of the best cows in the
stud herd. After two years’ use he was sold at a very
high figure to a New South Wales breeder, and his stock
always made good prices. His sire, Duke of Underley sth
(41,438), Mr. Clarke considered one of the best shorthorn
bulls ever imported to Australia.

This bull, like Charming Duke 3rd, was by the
noted sire Duke of Underley sth (41,438), whom Mr.
Clarke thought so much of that he determined to have
two sires by him in use. Belinda Duke of Derrimut 40th,
the champion bull of Victoria and New Zealand, was by
36th Duke of Derrimut or Lord Underley 4th, and Mr.
Clarke always considered he was by the latter, in which
case he would have two crosses of Duke of Underley sth
(41,438), his dam being by Charming Duke 3rd. The
champion cow Belinda Duchess of Derrimut 75th is
also by Lord Underley 4th, and her performances and
record have been previously given. Lord Underley 4th
proved himself a most successful sire.

This is a long, lengthy bull, with grand quarters,

stock, which are now crossing well with the imported
bull Duke of York 2nd (68,546).

This sire was imported by that well-known breeder,
Mr. John James, of Riccarton, Colac, one of the best
judges of shorthorns in Australia. He is a very
lengthy animal, shoulders coming well back, and hind-
quarters very long and coming well forward. He has
great loins, deep thighs but not coarse, flanks very
deep, good lines, both top and under, deep and
broad brisket, giving plenty of lung room, and a grand
head. His handling, hair, and flesh are simply perfect.
He has a good constitution, and is very docile. His
stock are all high class, and take after himself. They
have done well in the show-ring, and one heifer by him,
when six months old, was sold for 400 guineas. The
first prize yearling bull at the Royal Show, Melbourne,
1901, in a very strong class, was by him, and his owner
would not put a price on him—in fact, he said 1,000
guineas would not tempt him. The first prize two-year-
old heifer is also by him, and is now in the Bolinda
Yale herd, and 500 guineas would not be taken for her.
She was also first as a yearling in 1900.
Duke of York 2nd (68,546) is a very successful sire,
and no offer would entice Mr. Clarke to part with him,
bulls by him meeting with a ready sale at from 100 to
150 guineas each.
Mr. James also imported with Duke of York 2nd
his fine sire Clinker (66,846), and the stock of the two
bulls nick well, confirming Mr. James’s sound judgment
when selecting them in Great Britain.

Duke of Glenroy 3rd, bred by Mr. J. F. Reid, Elderslie, N.Z.; sire Duke of
Glenroy; dam Lady Matilda 2nd, by Lord Red Rose 2nd; granddam Matilda 18th,
by 22nd Duke of Derrimut; g. granddam Matilda 13th, by Oxford Cherry Duke
(32,016); g. g. granddam Matilda 2nd, by Royal Butterfly 6th (18,757); g. g. g.
granddam Matilda (imported, C. H. 8., vol. xiii.) Duke of Glenroy by Duke of
Underley sth (41,438); dam Lady Gazelle 2nd, by Fusilier (39,905) from Gazelle
26th (imported). Lord Red Rose 2nd by Duke of Oxford 31st (33,713); dam
Duchess 26th (imported).
This fine young sire, bred by Mr. John James, was
an exceedingly good show bull, winning first as two-year-
old, Royal Show, Melbourne, 1900, and afterwards sold
by auction for 300 guineas. Mr. Clarke only parted
with this beast because of the prejudice that breeders
have against the white colour, and why it exists it is hard
to find out. This bull, when a year old, was put to twelve
heifers, and they all had splendid dark roan calves —a grand
lot, and since they have grown up Mr. Clarke regrets having
parted with the sire. In the herd where he is now used,
out of twenty calves only one was white, and the dam of
this one was white herself. With reference to white short-
horns, Mr. Clarke’s experience on Belinda Yale estate is
that they do fully as well as the other colours, and the few
whites that they have are the best breeders and produce
equally as good stock, and this is applicable to both the
stud and the non-pedigreed herds. His opinion is that a
roan bull is likely to get as many white calves as a white
bull will. Most of the white bulls bred in Belinda stud,
owing to their not being so saleable, have been turned out
with the paddock herd, and anyone looking through it, and
knowing that the white bulls were used there, will be sur-
prised to see so few whites. In 1901, 153 station-bred steers
were sold, and the buyer asked why there were so few
white cattle, as his experience, extending over many years,
in fattening bullocks was that the whites were always the
best and first to fatten. Mr. Clarke is now keeping a
white bull out of their champion cow to use in the herd, and
will mate him with red cows. He finds the reds have a
tendency to get a little hard in flesh and hair, and the
white softens them and is likely to produce good roans.
His contention is that a shorthorn should have firm flesh
and a good coat of mossy hair. In Mr. T. Bell’s work, from
the notes of the celebrated shorthorn breeder T. Bates, he
writes, on page 41—“ Without hair and handling there
cannot be good shorthorns; ” and Mr. Clarke thinks
breeders in Australia should study this more than they
do. In handling a beast there are very few that know
the right flesh that is required, viz.—firm flesh, pleasant
to the touch, with a good thick hide ; not soft, flabby
flesh, which produces oily meat that never sets and is
disagreeable to eat. Some knowing judges of shorthorns
put the tips of their fingers on a beast, but you can only
judge of the quality of the flesh by putting the hand flat
on the animal, and it should handle alike all over the body.

dropped, but these are as good as anyone could wish.
The Flower tribe are noted for their heavy flesh, with
abundance of hair of the right sort.

The Non-Pedigreed Herd.
About the year 1871 the late Sir W. J. Clarke
purchased in the Melbourne market about 30 pure
shorthorn cows that were bred by Messrs. Kaye and
Butchart, of Bushy Park estate, Gippsland. These
cows were exceedingly well bred, as the breeders
had been importing pure shorthorns for many years,
but no pedigrees of the progeny were recorded.
However, they were the right sort, all good colours,,
massive frames, lengthy and deep, short on the leg, plenty
of hair, and mellow handlers. A stud bull was then pur-
chased for 200 guineas from the late Mr. Richard Morton
to put to them, and the following is his pedigree :
Dul<e Of Lancaster (312, V. H. B,), red, bred by the late
Richard Morton ; sire Duke of Brunswick (25,937).

ggggggggggggd by Burrell’s bull (3,248).
Duke of Lancaster was awarded first prize for aged bull at the Myrniong
Show, 1874, and sold to Mr. L. Dugdale for his stud herd, and that gentleman found
all the heifers by Duke of Lancaster were high-class milkers.
In 1873 two more stud bulls were purchased from
the late Mr. Morton, at 300 guineas each, viz.:—
sth Duke of the Butterflies (313, Y. H. B.), red roan, calved
29th November, 1872, bred by late Richard Morton; sire Duke
of Brunswick (25,937).

In 1881 60 head of pure shorthorn cows and calves
were purchased from Messrs. W. J. and A. Lobb, of
Darraweit Guim. These gentlemen started their herd
from the stock of Mr. C. B. Fisher and Mr. Boadle,
both of whom bred from imported stock, but Messrs. Lobb
did not record any pedigrees. The cows were of good
type, and similar to the Bushy Park ones, and left some
very fine stock.
The herd now numbers about 700 breeding cows
and heifers. Since it was founded only high-class
stud bulls have been used in it, most of them bred
in the Bolinda Yale stud herd and of Derrimut blood.
A large infusion of the blood of the famous Duke of
Brunswick (25,937) has been used, and he proved himself
to be one of the very best sires ever seen in Australia.
Over £BO,OOO worth of stock by him was sold in the
course of a few years.
A large number of young bulls, and also some
heifers, have been sold for station herds, and also to
dairymen, and have always given great satisfaction,
the dairymen being well pleased with the heifers as
milkers. Many of the bulls from the non-pedigreed herds
if taken up and fed as calves, would make first-class show
bulls, and, as an instance, one sold to go to Gippsland took
champion prize at Bairnsdale when two years old, com-
peting against all ages.
