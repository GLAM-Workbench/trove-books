PREFACE.
The following account of a visit paid to Sydney and the Cudgegong
Diamond Mines in New South Wales, in January and February
last, appeared in a series of letters published in the Bendigo
Advertiser. When they were written, they were addressed to a
special class of readers; and this will account for the references
to localities on Bendigo, and piatters of interest to Bendigo readers,
which may not be very intelligible to residents in other places.
Some slight alterations have been made in the letters, but, on the
whole, the writer thought it advisable to leave them pretty much
as they first appeared. The information contained in them might
have been given in a more condensed form, but it is questionable
whether it would have been more readable. The writer has only
to add that he has been induced to republish these letters in
consequence of the interest taken by so many persons in this
colony in the Diamond Mines of Cudgegong, to develop the riches
of which two Companies have been started by Victorian capital
and enterprise.

A VISIT TO SYDNEY
AND THE
CUDGBGONG DIAMOND MINESJ
No. I.
MELBOURNE TO SYDNEY,
Sydney, 24th January.
A visit to Sydney after an absence of several years is suggestive
to the most ordinary observer of many topics of interest, and per-
haps your Bendigo readers may find something in these jiotes that
will repay them the trouble of persual. You have recently had some
letters from a gushing correspondent descriptive of a visit to Sydney
?the ? Queen City,? as he calls it?a recollection of whose glowing
descriptions, interspersed with poetical quotations, warns me off the
ground so fully and ably occupied. Whatever tendency I may have
to go off into the raptures about the harbour and scenery of Port Jack-
son, or the features and surroundings of Sydney, I will therefore
restrain, and will confine myself to plain matter of fact. I make
this announcement to the intelligent reader so that he may under-
stand why it is that, in writing about places which usually send
writers off into rhapsodies, I adhere to plain prose, and may avoid
the error of supposing that the writer of this has not a soul above
prices current and stock and share reports.
A trip from Melbourne to Sydney, especially in so fine and fast a
boat as the City of Adelaide, and with so thorough a seaman as
Captain Walker, is not likely to be very fertile in incidents. The
pleasantest voyages, like the happiest lives, are those of which the
history is the least interesting. With the exception of the usual
steeplechase over the rollers of the ?rip? at Port Phillip Heads, the
sea from Hobson?s Bay to Darling Harbour was calm enough for a
waterman?s boat to make good weather. Wilson?s Promontory and
the islands are usually made about one or two o?clock in the morning
by a steamer which leaves Sandridge at one o?clock in the afternoon,
and about that hour a look-out is kept for the lighthouse on the Pro-
montory. As the steamer approaches this, the rounded outlines of
the islands and of the high main land loom on the east horizon, and


we soon find ourselves passing to the south of Skull Island, and then
between Eodondo and the lighthouse, thankful that we are not
running the gauntlet among these island-rocks on a dark night in a
gale of wind, with the light hid in a fog. In fine weather the
Sydney steamers keep close in shore, so that a capital view is ob-
tained of the coast of Gipps Land to the north of the Ninety-Mile
Beach up to Cape Howe and Gabo Island, and of the greater portion
of the coast of New South Wales up to Sydney Heads. The head-
lands at and near Jervis?s Bay, the beautiful country about Shoal-
haven, Kiama. and Wollongong, the heads of Botany Bay, and the
iron-bound coast thence to South Head dotted with villas, especially
attract notice. Our passengers comprised members of Parliament
hailing from three colonies?New Zealand, New South Wales, and
Victoria ?and squatters from the latter two and Queensland. No-
body, however, talked politics, or said anything about the Land Bill,
and even the momentous question of the re-construction of the
Macpherson Cabinet scarcely provoked a remark. Some curiosity was
certainly evinced about the Eaglehawk dinner to the Ministry, of the
same kind as that prompted by the fly in amber, the wonder how
the devil he got there. We saw the usual number of sails above
the horizon, beguiled the time by reading, watching the porpoises, or
playing with rope quoits, met the Wonga Wonga and overtook the
Tasmania, and made Port Jackson Heads about six o?clock in the
evening. The harbour appeared to me to be small and confined after
having been accustomed to the broad expanse of Port Phillip Bay,
but this appearance is in some measure owing to the lofty land sur-
rounding the greater portion of it. As the weather was fine, and the
anniversary regatta close at hand, the bays were crowded with boats
of all kinds. The ships in the harbour were smaller than those
which trade to Hobson?s Bay, and there were not so many as I ex-
pected to find. Seen from the water, the city presents marked signs
of improvements in every direction, in the number of handsome re-
sidences that have been built, and fine streets laid out in places
which, a few years since, were covered with stunted trees, or were
picturesque with jutting rocks.
A closer view of Sydney bears out the first impression of the
improvements that have been made. In the chief streets very
handsome buildings have been erected, and there has been a
remarkable extension of the suburbs. Possessed with a profound
belief in the superiority of Melbourne, and hopeful that this supe-
riority will always be maintained, I yet confess sundry misgivings as
to the relative position of the two cities in the next ten years.
There are certainly no such magnificent structures in Sydney as the
Melbourne Post-office is, and the Town Hall promises to be. The
Sydney people are, however, building both a Post-office and Town
Hall; the latter is on a portion of the old George-street burial
ground, and on such a site they should be able to place a handsomer


building than the Town Hall in Melbourne. As it is little more
than commenced, however, I cannot form any opinion on this point.
The new Post-office, on the site of the old one in George-street, is,
however, pretty well advanced; and I can with confidence say that,
although it promises to be a very fine building so far as the front
is concerned, which has a row of granite columns, it is not to be
compared with the Post-office in Melbourne,
What I am especially struck with in Sydney is the change in the
business people, who are fast assimilating to the Victorian type, and
no longer deserve to be taunted as slow. This was of course to be
expected, and yet it takes one by surprise to find George-street as
bustling and full of life and activity as Bourke-street, and the
business men nearly as fast and as loud as in Collins-street. In
omnibuses Sydney is far beyond Melbourne, even with its recent
development of this mode of conveyance. The number continually
passing along the narrow streets to and from Woolloomooloo, Dar-
linghurst, Waverley, Redfern, Newtown, &c,, is astonishing, and one
is not surprised at the frequent accidents. People dress here quite
as extensively as in Melbourne, and George-street on an afternoon is
a combination of Bourke-street and Collins-street, with the traffic of
the former and the fashion of the latter.
While threading my way through the crowd on the pavement of
George-street the day after my arrival, I had an agreeable surprise. A
portly gentleman, with capacious white waistcoat, smiling benignantly,
and evidently regarded with deference and respect by those around,
almost embraced me, and presented me to his companions as one of
his oldest friends, a distinguished visitor from Victoria. When I
say that I was forcibly reminded of Micawber when he introduced
David Copperfield in a most gushing manner to his acquaintances as
the friend of his youth, let it not be supposed that I intend the
slightest disrespect to an old Bendigo friend, for whom Bendigo
must always entertain sentiments of respect and gratitude, Mr. E. N.
Emmett. Along with Mr, Emmett was Mr. T. Wilton, of the
Bathurst Times , formerly of the firm of Mackay and Wilton, of
Sandhurst. Mr. Emmett is engaged in a very important under-
taking, the formation of a company to work a coal seam at Lithgow
Valley, near Bowenfels, the present terminus of the Western Rail-
way. He and the gentlemen associated with him in the enterprise,
among whom is Mr. Wilton, have obtained a lease of upwards of
1100 acres of land, on which the seam of coal has been tested in
several places and found to be from four to ten feet in thickness.
The coal is of the very best quality, and can be sent by rail to
Sydney at a trifling cost. The lessees, who are in high spirits with
their prospects, are now in negotiation with the Government about
the rate of carriage of the coal by train. I intend paying this coal-
field a visit, and making some notes about it. A discovery like this
in Victoria would be of especial value to you.


I saw the balloon ascent on Saturday in the Domain. There
were several thousand persons present. The balloon appeared to be
made of silk, with a net of thin rope round it, fastened to a thick
wooden hoop below. There was no car. When the balloon was
sufficiently inflated, Gale, the aeronaut, who is a young man with a
determined cast of countenance, sat on the hoop, took hold of the
rope netting, and gave the word to let go the rope. The balloon
rose a small distance, and then descended to the ground. Gale
threw over all his sand bags, and the balloon shot up from the ground,
and, clearing the trees, was carried by the wind to the south-west.
The aeronaut waved his red cap to the spectators with one hand,
whilst with the other he held fast to the netting, with difficulty re-
taining his uncomfortable seat. He rose to a great height, until he
himself appeared a mere ball, and then descended in safety about
seven or eight miles out of Sydney. The weather has been very
pleasant, the heat being every day tempered with a cool sea breeze,
so that as far as weather is concerned I have been agreeably dis-
appointed.

THE ANNIVERSARY REGATTA.
Before entering upon an account of my visit to the Lithgow Valley
coal field and the Cudgegong diamond diggings, I may notice two
or three subjects in Sydney worthy of passing reference. I was at
the Anniversary Regatta, on the 26th of January, which was once
the grand attraction of the gala day of the year in Sydney?but
what a falling off was there ! I remember how, year after year, the
harbour on this day was alive with steamers, sailing vessels, and
boats crowded with passengers, and that it was with difficulty a
vessel could find a passage between the flag ship and Dawes? Battery
Point. In those days the green slopes of this point, Fort Mac-
quarrie, on the opposite of the cove, and North Shore, as well as
the many points, islands, and headlands down the harbour, were
thronged with thousands of spectators and hundreds of picnic
parties. Scores of booths drove a roaring trade, and fruit both on
the water and on land could be got almost for nothing. Fine ripe
peaches a penny a dozen, and crisp ripe watermelons a penny or
twopence each, were prevailing cries. The various aquatic matches
were watched with eager interest by crowds of old and young, and
cheers and shouts of encouragement as the boats passed the various
points rent the air. At this anniversary how changed all this was, an
how strangely the contrast struck one who had not become gradually


accustomed to it. The races were by no means good, though there
has been an immense improvement in the building of boats and
yachts in Sydney. The attendance was very poor, and the interest
taken of the most languid description. Here and there a knot of
confirmed lovers of aquatics scanned the manoeuvres of the com-
petitors with telescopes, and discussed their varying fortunes. There
were but few boats on the water, and the Great Eastern would have
found little trouble in steaming right up the harbour in the middle of
the regatta. One or two makeshift booths were the only places
where refreshments could be got, and the best refreshments consisted
of slices of cold meat and bread?not even decent sandwiches. The
flagship which the Governor visited at lunch time seemed to be
tolerably crowded. As I have said, the races generally were
indifferent and uninteresting. Great dissatisfaction had been caused
among the owners of yachts by the system of handicapping which has
come into vogue, and under which any old tub may win the prize
from the crack yacht. There are several reasons that may be
assigned for this falling off in the Anniversary Regatta at Sydney.
Formerly a regatta came but once a year, or at most twice or thrice.
Now upwards of half a dozen localities have their regattas, such as
Balmain, Double Bay, Kissing Point, &c,, and on every holiday there
are aquatic sports. Then there are two yacht clubs, and they have
their regular club matches. Besides this, however, the anniversary
is now devoted to other recreations, and especially to excursions on
the railway and in the steamers.
There are two yacht clubs in Sydney, and quite a fleet of yachts
from thirty-five tons downwards. Many of these are beautiful
models, that would do no discredit to the Royal Thames Club.
Indeed some of them have been constructed by famous English
yacht builders, and they are by no means superior to the best
specimens of colonial skill. The Mistral, a cutter of thirty-five tons,
the property of Mr. Dangar, the commodore of the Royal Sydney
Yacht Club, is an English model, and reckoned to be a very fine one,
yet she has almost invariably been beaten by the Xarifa, a cutter of
the same tonnage, built in Sydney by Mr. Shea, and modelled, I
believe, on the principle of parabolic water lines. The Mistral,
which I saw up in dock, combines some of the latest improve-
ments in yacht modelling, so that the Sydney builder may very
fairly plume himself upon his success. She is narrow and deep, with
great rise of floor, very sharp forward and the beam carried aft, as
in the English fliers that have turned the tables on the Americans.
The Xarifa is not very handsome, but she can travel, especially on a
wind in rough water, where she shows more buoyancy than her
English rival. There is nothing very absurd in the idea that
Australia may one day send home a yacht to carry off the honours
from the best crafts in the old world. The best second-class Sydney
yacht is also colonial, the Nereid, built by Messrs. Langford, of


Miller?s Point, whom I remember as boys five-and-twenty years ago.
When looking at this beautiful cutter, which is as fine a model
as any I ever saw in wood or on paper, one cannot help wonder-
ing where the builders, who never were out of Sydney, got their
ideas from. She, like the Mistral, has great depth and great?rise of
floor, but she is not hollowed out so much in the bottom and en-
trance, and is therefore more buoyant. The yacht Haidee, now the
crack at Geelong, was an old antagonist of the Nereid; but although
four or five tons larger, she was no match for the latter. A day or
two before I left Sydney, I saw a race of the second-class yachts of
the Royal Sydney Yacht Club, when the Nereid won easily. After
the race I went on board in time to partake of a capital lunch with
the owner, Mr. Alfred Fairfax, nephew of Mr. John Fairfax, proprie-
tor of the Sydney Morning Herald. Of course one is always com-
paring the merits and the defects of other places with those of our
own. In the matter of yachts, Melbourne is nowhere. Yet Port
Phillip Bay is better adapted for yachts of thirty or forty tons than
Port Jackson. Even Geelong has a Yacht Club and some very fair
boats, and has a periodical regatta. Melbourne cannot boast of a
club, and she never has sailing races; indeed she hardly possesses a
single yacht in the proper sense of the word. The only serious
effort to get up yacht races was some three or four years ago, with
little models in the Sandridge lagoon ! This is not creditable to a
large commercial seaport, with so numerous and wealthy a population.
The reader who is not an enthusiast in aquatics must excuse this
string of gossip about Sydney yachts and yachting, and be thankful
that I have been considerate enough to pull up so soon, and not
follow the bent of my inclination by a dissertation upon the subject
several columns long.
Your clever and poetical correspondent ? Austral? has, to use a
nautical expression, quite taken the wind out of my sails by his
glowing descriptions of what is beautiful and interesting in the
? Queen City,? and I must be content to pick up such scraps as
have escaped his attention. That touch of his in his last letter,
where he describes the Lower Domain in Sydney as the place which
would just suit Tennyson?s lotos eaters, is capital, and those who
know the locality will agree with me. But my business is with
matter of fact and prosaic things. It is due to Messrs. Greville and
Co. that I should refer to the Exchange they have established close
to the new Post-office in George-street. This is a place something
like the Hall of Commerce in Melbourne, and it is to be supported
by subscribers who will pay a small annual sum for the privileges
of members. In the centre of the Exchange is a large high desk
running down the length of the room, on which the late copies of
the chief papers in Sydney, Melbourne, and other important towns
are placed. There are files of almost every paper published in these
colonies, and a reading room to consult them in. At each side of


the room are tables with writing materials. At the end of the room,
opposite the door, figure the addresses of the members of the
Exchange who choose to pay for the advertisement. Behind this
is a row of rooms for offices, or where the members can see persons
on business. There is a lavatory, and Mr. Greville proposes to have
a refreshment room on the premises, where the members can have
their lunch, and thus be saved the trouble of going to hotels and
restaurants. The room is lofty, and there are galleries round it,
where Greville and Co.?s staff conduct their business without being
interrupted, but with a full view of all that takes place below in the
hall. At the aides of the hall are boards with all the latest tele-
graphic information about shipping in the different ports of the
Australian colonies. A large blackboard is devoted to the purpose
of publishing in chalk Greville and Co.?s telegrams every day at two
p.m. I was present when the clerk chalked up the information from
Sandhurst about the 1300 ounces cake of gold taken from the Great
Extended Hustler?s, which piece of intelligence caused no small
interest and excitement among those present. I must confess, how-
ever, that the acquaintance of the Sydneyites with this interesting
town of Sandhurst did not appear to be commensurate with its
importance. Most of them had only a vague notion of its where-
abouts or of its characteristics. When informed that Sandhurst
meant Bendigo, however, they brightened up. The latter name
was evidently, like Ballarat, quite familiar to them ; and they
appeared to think that large cakes of gold from Bendigo were just
what might be expected, and nothing so very extraordinary after all.
Messrs. Greville and Co.?s Exchange is a valuable institution, and
the visitor to Sydney should obtain the entr6e to it if he wishes to
secure the latest information, and keep himself posted up in what
is going on, not only in Sydney, but throughout the Australian
colonies.

SYDNEY POLITICIANS.
Politics are in a somewhat chaotic condition in Sydney. At the
period of my visit the elections were just over, and Parliament was
about to meet. The result of the elections was to give Mr. Robert-
son a decided, though a small, majority. The great question upon
which parties were divided can hardly be said to have been political.
The issue was Mr. Robertson?s government as against the govern-
ment of Sir James Martin and Mr. Parkes, and the education
question was the chief one raised. The elections in the large towns
and cities seemed to have been decided with reference to this alone.


The present system of education in Hew South Wales, which is very
similar to our own, and is to a great extent a copy of it, was mainly
established by the exertions of Mr. Parkes, The Catholics complain,
just as they do here, that under this system they are not fairly treated,
and that their conscientious convictions in reference to education are
disregarded. This has brought Mr. .Parkes into collision with the
clergy of that body, and at the elections he and his friends found
themselves strongly opposed by the Catholic interest. The natural
result followed, that the more zealous Protestants warmly espoused
the cause of Mr. Parkes, and the elections in the larger towns became
a series of sectarian struggles. Here Mr. Parkes and his friends com-
manded overwhelming majorities, but in the country districts, where
sectarian differences did not run so high, or where the Catholic vote
was strong, the result of the elections was chiefly in favour of the
Government. I think that after the struggle was over both parties
were somewhat ashamed of the prominence which had been given to
sectarian differences, and certainly the rancour of the strife has died
out. We may take a lesson here from the experience of our neigh-
bours, and endeavour to avoid mixing up religious with political
differences. The Education question is bound to come before the
electors of Victoria before long ; and while it is to be hoped that it
will be settled on such a basis as will free our education system from
any interference on the part of the clergy of any denomination, we
must treat with due consideration the convictions, and what we may
think the prejudices, of the various religious communities.
A strange and almost unprecedented occurence took place in the
political world of Hew South Wales at the time of the elections.
Mr. Charles Cowper, who at one time was the most influential poli-
tician in Sydney (having held the position of Premier for several
years), and who had bade adieu to politics and retired into private
life some years ago, re-appeared as a candidate for Parliamentary
honours. At the same time Mr. Robertson, the Premier, lesigned
his position in the Cabinet in favour of Mr. Cowper, who thus at one
step emerged from private life and became the head of the Govern-
ment. It will be admitted that this was a far more glaring case than
that of the appointment of Mr. Rolfe, which led to the resignation of
the M'Culloch Ministry in Victoria. Members of Parliament in
Sydney seemed to be confounded by it, and unable to come to any
conclusion as to what should be done. The cause of Mr. Robertson?s
resignation is well known to have been pecuniary difficulties?
? That cursed want of pence
Which vexes public men.?
There is another prominent member in the Sydney Legislature
who is said also to be in monetary difficulties, but I trust that
rumour has exaggerated the truth in his case. I visited the House
at its opening. Although very much improved since I frequented


them as a reporter, eighteen years ago, the Sydney Legislative Cham-
bers are far inferior to those of Melbourne, with the exception of
the refreshment rooms, and these I believe have been recently built.
The Assembly chamber is small and inconvenient, but has better
acoustic properties than our more pretentious chamber in Melbourne.
There is a good collection of books in the library, but they are not
well arranged, and the rooms are utterly unfit for the purpose, form-
ing a striking contrast to our Parliamentary Library rooms. The
site of the Parliament Houses in Sydney is one of* the finest, and it
will one day be ennobled by a building worthy of it and worthy of
the colony. It fronts Macquarie-street, which is the most elevated
portion of East Sydney. The street is certainly very narrow, but there
is a fine open space in front of the Parliament houses. On the other
side, to the east, the houses face the Domain, and command one of
the most exquisite views that can be imagined. Beneath the specta-
tor is a row of English oaks, fringing a carriage drive that skirts an ex-
panse of green sward on which the All England Eleven cricket matches
were played. The sward, which is of the richest emerald, is bounded
by the Domain enclosure, and by a belt of open forest. Just over
and through the foliage of the Norfolk Island pines of the Domain
and the native trees of the bush appear the waters of the harbour,
blue as sapphire with the reflection of the sky, which are enclosed by
the high land to the north and east, picturesque with dusky green
wooded slopes and projecting rocks of grey sandstone. Beyond
the waters of the harbour, to the eastward the view is bounded by
the high land of South Head, crowned with the lighthouse, and with
the bold abrupt outlines of North Head sharply defined against the
clear sky. To the right, the high lands from Darlinghurst to the
South Head and the long slopes to the water are whitened with the
mansions and villas of the wealthy denizens of Sydney. Such a site
would be worthily adorned with a noble building for* the Legislature
of the country.
Reverting to the present aspect of politics in Sydney, there is a
general impression that a crisis is not far off. A great defect in the
legislation of our neighbours is the want of a good Mining Statute,
and of good management of the goldfields. This was very apparent
in the report of an interview of a deputation from the miners of
Trunkey Creek with Mr. Cowper, the Premier, and Mr. Foster, the
Land Minister, who has the mines under his charge. Mr. E. N.
Emmett, to whom I have already alluded, was present as spokesman
for some of the Trunkey miners, and he boldly charged the Govern-
ment with a neglect of the ordinary requirements of the miners, with
excessive delays in attending to applications, and the granting of
leases without proper surveys. Mr. Foster, who is always bristling
like a porcupine, was very much ruffled by this plain speaking, and
did not appear to advantage. There is an opening in New South
Wales for a man with a knowledge of what is required for the


mining population, and with the ability and energy to force the subject
on the attention of the Legislature, to make a name for and
to do incalculable good to the country. For it must be admitted
that while New South Wales is inferior to Victoria in the richness of
its goldfields?and this is disputed by many?it is far superior to it
in the variety and extent of its mineral resources. The traveller to
Mudgee, from the top of one of the many hills on which he has to
travel, has within sight of him a coalfield, a goldfield, and a
diamond country,�besides mines of iron, copper, and cinnabar; and
of what other country in the world can this be said except perhaps
Brazil ? The coast of New South Wales for three hundred miles
from Newcastle towards Twofold Bay is full of coal seams. Coal
from Bulli, fifty miles south of Sydney, is now competing in the
market with that from Newcastle, seventy miles to the north.
I met several of the New South Wales legislators, and was chiefly
struck by the fact that they are more Australian than our Victorian
M.L.A.S, while at the same time they seem to have more reverence
for the mother country. Mr. Buchanan, in a conversation about Mr.
Higinbotham?s resolutions of last session, fully sympathised with
their spirit, and said something to the effect that the sooner we cut
the painter from the mother country the better. Several members
present, some of them native Australians, appeared to hold such
views in horror. Sir James Martin preserves his old vivacity and
energy on the Opposition benches, and keeps Mr. Cowper and his
colleagues on their mettle. The latter looks careworn and aged, but
he is still alert, and preserves his blandness of manner. Mr. Parkes,
who stands now perhaps the foremost politician in the sister colony, is
quiet and self-possessed, conscious that he has only to wait a little
longer to find himself securely seated in power. Great regret is felt
for Mr. John Robertson in his difficulties. His manly, genial qualities
have made him warm friends even among his political opponents.
He is a man of marked ability and energy, and the country can ill
spare him. His difficulties result from losses in squatting, and
rumour hints at an amount of liabilities of six figures. The habitu6
of the Legislative Assembly Chambers in Sydney misses from* his ac-
customed place that veteran politician, the Rev. Dr. Lang, who has bid
adieu to public life. Now that increased years and growing infirm-
ities have removed him from the arena of active public life, and men?s
judgments are no longer warped by their feelings, justice is being
done to this extraordinary man, the history of whose career is a history
of the progress of the Australian colonies. People regard now with
a loving reverence the venerable colonist, who has led a life of such
incessant activity, and a life devoted to the advancement of his
adopted country. Old party differences are forgotten, and the
marvellous courage, energy, ability, and philanthropy of the man are
now remembered. The divine, the author, the politician, whose restless
energy and public spirit drove him to circumnavigate the globe so


often to plead the cause of Australia before her rulers, who first
directed a stream of immigration to Sydney, and who assisted in
making Victoria and Queensland independent colonies?Dr. Lang is
now becoming recognised as he should be, and the people of New
South Wales, who always took a pride in him, begin to realise
his true greatness. When he has passed away from the scene of his
labours of nearly half a century, when the true value of his exertions
is understood, and his truly catholic philanthropy becomes known,
his memory will be reverenced as that of the best and greatest man
that Australia has produced.

THE LITHGOW VALLEY COALFIELD.
In a former letter I stated that, as I was about to pay a visit to
the new coalfield near Hartley, where Mr. Emmett, along with some
other gentlemen, had taken a lease of ground to work the coal, I
would furnish you with some information respecting it. I formed
one of a party of gentlemen on a special visit to the locality by the
Western Kailway, among whom, including Mr. Emmett, w T ere three
of the five leaseholders of the ground. Among the rest were Sir
James Martin and Mr. John Lucas, formerly a member of the
Assembly. The Sydney railway station, I need hardly say, did not
strike me with admiration, but it is not much inferior to that in
Spencer-street, Melbourne. In both cases the array of wooden sheds
are mere makeshifts; and from what I subsequently saw of the
stations along the line of railway over the Blue Mountains, I am
inclined to think that the future Sydney raihvay station will not be
much inferior to the future one of Melbourne. We have begun to
repent of our extravagances in railway stations, whereas the New
South Wales people appear to be smitten with the desire of emulating
these extravagances.
Comfortably seated in one of those splendid new carriages on the
Sydney line which, in point of commodiousness and elegance, throw
?our small, fusty, and worn Victorian carriages altogether into the
shade, we started at nine o?clock in the morning for our trip across
the mountains. The route of the railway for nine or ten miles out
of Sydney gives the traveller a good view of the extension of the
Sydney suburbs in this direction. One cannot help speculating on
the keen rivalry there will be during the next ten years between
Sydney and Melbourne for the position of metropolis of Australia.
We stopped at the usual number of intermediate stations, and had
several opportunities of admiring the orchards, and especially the
orangeries, near Parramatta. The country between this town and


Penrith is not very interesting, and here, over a magnificent bridge,
we cross the Nepean or Hawksbury, a broad deep river, whose floods
have such a melancholy celebrity in the history of New South
Wales. Eapidly passing over the few miles of plains at the foot -of
the mountains, we come to the great feature of interest, the Zig Zag
up the steep face of the range, a more detailed notice of which I
shall give when describing the railway itself. The views from the
top of the mountains called forth remarks of surprise and admiration,
even from those among us who had travelled over the country before.
There was Mount Tomah, with its forests and ferns like those of the
Dandenong, and the conical peak of Mount Hay, and the tremendous
ravine of the Valley of the Grose ; whilst on all sides the sandstone
ranges, with their flat tops and perpendicular sides, loomed across
chasms, the bottoms of which could not be seen, like the battlements
of giant fortifications. At the top of Mount Lapstone I noticed
beds of sandstone conglomerate, or the pudding stone of the
carboniferous age, which accounts for the accumulations of whinstone
boulders and pebbles that are so abundant in the watercourses about
this portion of the country, and which have given a name to Lap-
stone Hill. Man cannot live upon grand scenery alone, however,
even when diversified with geological observations and discussions,
and the keen mountain air reminded us of the well-stocked box of
provisions and refreshments that Mr. Emmett had been provident
enough to bring with him. It is hardly necessary to say that ample
justice was done to the stock furnished by mine host of the Royal
Hotel, Mr. Skarratt, erstwhile of Melbourne fame in the hotel line.
Success was drunk to the new coal-field among the Blue Mountains,
and full credit given to the mineral riches of New South Wales. At
the One Tree Hill station, where we stopped a few minutes, we
seemed to have got up among the clouds, and from this point the
railway diverged to the north from the old Bathurst-road, and
plunged into a chaos of barren rocky mountains, passing through
a tunnel upwards of a third erf a mile long. Then came another
zigzag like three staircases almost perpendicularly above each other,
and finally a smooth run into the station at Lithgow Valley, where
Mr. P. Higgins, the railway contractor, well known in Sandhurst, and
Dr. Mackenzie, met us with buggies to convey us to the residence of
the former, a couple of miles off, where we need not say we were
entertained in the style of hospitality which distinguishes an Irish
gentleman.
We devoted the rest of the afternoon to an examination of the coal
seam on the ground leased by Mr. Emmett and his partners, and
on private property in the vicinity, and I shall devote the remainder
of this letter to an account of the coalfield at Lithgow Valley based
upon personal observation and upon reliable information. It would
appear that the existence of coal among these ranges has been
known for very many years, but no one thought of utilising it until


recently.* The distance from a market and the expense of carriage
were insurmountable obstacles in the way. The discovery of kero-
sene shale in the Hartley district, which adjoins this, directed more
attention to the mineral resources of the place, but the low price of
imported kerosene has kept down enterprise in this direction. Dr.
Mackenzie, already alluded to. and his brother, Mr. John Mackenzie,
who had been an inspector of coalfields in England, sunk a good
deal of money in the raising of shale and the manufacture of kero-
sene at a locality a few miles distant, called Morangaroo. They,
along with Mr. Higgins, examined the coal seam, and found that the
coal was of an excellent quality, and extended throughout a con-
siderable tract of country. The proprietors of the land through
which the seam passes tested the coal, and in one instance Mr.
Thomas Brown, police magistrate, drove an adit into the seam,
opened up the coal, used it himself, and supplied it for the railway
engines. The three gentlemen already named?together with Mr. T.
Wilton, of Bathurst, and Mr. E. H. Emmett, whose Trunkey Creek
enterprises introduced him to notice in Hew South Wales as an
active speculator?determined to work this coal seam on a large
scale, and entered into negotiations with the proprietors of land in
the neighbourhood. They found upon examination that, as these
held only the good agricultural land in the valleys, there was a large
extent of rich coal land still unalienated from the Crown. Upon
this hint they acted, and lost no time in visiting the Land Office,
and securing a lease of 1016 acres of land lying between the
private holdings of land where the seam has been tested. They
have since purchased 110 acres of land from Mr, Sheedy, on
which the coal has been proved in two places, and which is favour-
ably situated for commencing their working and erecting the
necessary buildings and machinery. The seam of coal is nearly
horizontal, with a slight dip to the north. In several places in the
Lithgow Valley it crops out on the surface, and it may be seen in some
instances among the horizontal strata of the perpendicular sandstone
cliffs, passing conformably to the formation through the mountains.
The railway passes over it in the valley, and it has been proved both
to the north and the south. On the north, as I have already said,
the seam dips, and the workings there must therefore be rather
below the level of the line of railway. On the south the seam rises
with the ground, and the workings will overlook the railway. The
importance of this fact will be understood when it is considered that
the loaded trucks can be run along a tramway to the railway by the
mere force of their gravity alone. The land leased and purchased
lies to the south of the line abutting on the railway, and the seam
is throughout above the railway level. A small valley on the west
drains the land, so that there will be no difficulty in dealing with
* See Rev. W. B. Clarke?s Report in Appendix,


any water in the mine. The seam has been found of a uniform
thickness of ten feet six inches where tested in the ground proposed
to be wrought and the vicinity. At Hassan?s Walls, where it crops
out, it is of a less thickness, and further off diminishes to three feet
six inches. It has been proved on the lands of Messrs. Andrew
Brown, Saywell and Garsed, Thomas Brown, and Sheedy, which
surround the leased land. The coal is of excellent quality, of the
description called splint coal, and burns well, leaving a white ash.
It was recognised by several as similar to what is called the
Branxton coal, which is regarded as very good. We paid a
visit to the workings of Mr. Thomas Brown, north of the
railway. We there found a coal fire burning in the most satisfactory
manner, giving a practical illustration of the value of the coal. The
adit has been carried into rising ground for some sixty or seventy
yards, and a tramway has been laid into the mine, on which horses
draw out the coal on trucks. The seam is here 10 feet 6 inches
thick, and the roof is a flat shelf of hard sandstone extending
throughout like a ceiling. Such a roof as this renders the cost of
timbering comparatively trifling. Mr. Brown?s mine labours under
the disadvantage of being below the level of the railway, which will
increase the cost of carriage. He has been supplying Mr. Higgins?s
works at Lithgow Valley, and his engines, with the coal. Mr. T.
Brown has 700 acres of land, and there is no doubt it will be a
valuable property when it is systematically worked. We then
visited Sheedy?s property, to the south of the railway. Here in one
place we found the seam of coal cropping out on the surface; and
about two hundred yards off, on the rising ground, we came to a shaft
twenty feet deep, where the coal had again been found, in all respects
similar to Mr. Thomas Brown?s, in thickness, quality, and the sand-
stone roof above the seam. We found, of course, considerable excite-
ment in the locality on the subject, all the more when it was under-
stood that a lease of upwards of 1000 acres had been obtained of
land right in the midst of those who were expecting a handsome
sum of money for their property from the projectors. ? But these
Victorian speculators are such smart fellows,? say the New South.
Welshmen, in a tone partly of chagrin and partly of excuse for their
own slowness.
It certainly appears to me that Mr. Emmett and his enterprising
friends have hit upon a good thing. I understand that Sir James
Martin thinks very favourably of the enterprise, and intends accepting
office as a director in the company that is to be formed. There is a
current notion in Sydney that whatever this gentleman heartily takes
up is bound to be a success, and his name is certainly a tower of
strength to the new enterprise. Mr. John Lucas, a member of the
former Parliament, and a well-known, intelligent, and enterprising
colonist, was also very favourably impressed with the prospects of
the undertaking and will also be a director. The company will, I


presume, be formed immediately, and certainly under such favourable
auspices and conditions as seem to warrant sanguine hopes of success.
The essential question remains to be answered. The coal is good
and can be easily got, but can it compete in Sydney with that of
Newcastle or Bulli, which latter place is attracting great attention
as a coal district 1 This will depend upon the rate of carriage to be
charged by the Government on the railway. The projectors say if
the same rate per mile is charged as at the northern mines
the coal can be placed in Sydney cheaper than that from
Newcastle. This would make the charge from Lithgow Valley
to Sydney 4s. Gd. per ton, but they would not object to ss.
The freight from Newcastle to Sydney is 4s. 6d. per ton, and, as
the coal undergoes more handling in shipment than by train, the
coal from Lithgow Valley would successfully compete with that
from Newcastle. The company would supply their own trucks,
which, loaded at the mine, would be discharged in Sydney, at the
wharf in Darling Harbour. There is an extensive demand for coal
in the manufactories of Sydney, and in the towns of Penrith and
Parramatta, and here the Lithgow coal could defy competition.
Some interesting calculations have been made in reference to the
future working of the mine, but they would be out of place in a
sketch like this, I may mention, however, that it is reckoned that
there are upwards of 14,000,000 tons of coal in the land of the
company, which at an average yield of 3000 tons per week would
last for ninety years.
When visiting this district, and realising the immense value to
any country, and more especially a manufacturing country, of a
plentiful supply of cheap fuel, I of course thought of the great want
in Victoria of coal mines, and the incalculable value to her of a dis-
covery of coal within easy access. In conversing on the subject
with Mr. John Mackenzie, whose practical knowledge on the subject
is of course extensive, I found that he had been in Victoria, and was
sanguine that profitable coal seams would yet be discovered there.
Our savans, instead of directing their knowledge and abilities to the
question whether there is any coal formation in the country and
where, have been and are still wrangling with the Eev. W. B. Clarke,
and other Sydney geologists, as to the age and proper position of the
New South Wales coal measures. The latter assert that they are the
true coal formation of the carboniferous era, and the former dispute
their legitimacy, and make out that they are not the regular coal
measures. When learned doctors thus differ, and thus waste
their energies in profitless discussion, practical men must set to
work to solve the difficulty. We want some men like Mr. Mac-
kenzie to make a thorough search throughout the colony for
coal, and we have little doubt that it would be successful. From
what is known of Gipps Land and the Western District, there is
every probability that coal will be discovered in these portions of the
b 2


colony some day. In the meantime, however, while the grass
grows, &c. ?the proverb, as Hamlet says, is somewhat musty. Some
serious effort should be made to find profitable coal seams in \ ic-
toria, either by the Government or by some association of wealthy
and influential persons. In the meantime lam sure all my readers
will be heartily glad to hear that an old Bendigo man, who is
identified with so many of our public enterprises and institutions,
is devoting his energies so successfully to the work of assisting
in the development of the mineral resources of the sister colony.

THE WESTERN RAILWAY.
The visitor to New South Wales desirous of seeing what is of in-
terest in the colony, has his attention directed to the Western Railway
from Sydney to Bathurst, which is in course of construction. He
hears a great deal about the Zig Zag, and the fine scenery of the Blue
Mountains, and of course makes it his business to enjoy the pleasure
of a trip on the line as far as the trains travel. About forty miles
west of Sydney begins a range, or rather an array of ranges, of
mountains, which forms a dividing barrier between the waters that
flow to the east into the sea and to the w r est into the'interior. This
range extends from north to south throughout the whole length of
the colony. On the east it is abrupt and precipitous as if it had
formed the old coast line, and after rising to a considerable height
some thirty or forty miles inland, it gradually slopes towards the
plains of the interior. The river Hawksbury or Nepean flows at
the eastern foot of this range of mountains for a considerable distance
from south to north, and then, turning to the east, north of Richmond
and Windsor, it flows onward to the coast at Broken Bay. This
range has ever since the foundation of the colony presented a serious
obstacle to communication with the interior, and the road made over
it by Sir Thomas Mitchell forty years ago, chiefly by prison labour,
has always been regarded as a striking instance of engineering skill.
This road ascended the range at Lapstone Hill by a series of
cuttings on the sides of hills overhanging deep gullies, and forty
miles further to the west descended at Mount Victoria by another
series of similar cuttings into the Yale of Clwyd, a Welsh
name given on account of its supposed resemblance to a celebrated
valley in Wales. The railway follows pretty closely the line of road
to within about ten miles of Mount Victoria, when it turns to the
north-west by Mount Clarence, and gradually drops into the Lith-
gow Valley.


There is nothing specially worthy of remark about the railway
until it reaches Penrith, where it crosses the Nepean River by a
magnificent bridge some 200 yards in length. After passing over the
Emu Plains ?a narrow belt of level country between the river and
the mountains?the line commences the ascent of the range, passing
over Knapsack and other gullies by a series of viaducts, with arches
constructed in the most substantial manner of freestone obtained
from the ranges, which are composed of sandstone of the carbon-
iferous age deposited in horizontal layers. The steep face of the
range is ascended by what is called the Zig Zag, that is by a series
of ascents like the letter Z. Instead of winding round the hills in a
series of curves, which would indeed be impossible except at an
enormous expense, the railway, after ascending the hill for about a
third of a mile at a sharp gradient towards the south-west, turns at
an acute angle to the north-east, and ascends for a similar distance
and gradient, then turns again at an acute angle and completes the
ascent of the range. At each acute angle the train runs into a cul
de sac, the motion is reversed, and the train passes on to the other line
of rails, the upper or lower as the case may be, the engine which
was in front pulling now being behind pushing, and again regaining
its proper position. At each reversal, of course, the train comes to
a stop, but it is only for an instant of time, and the passengers
hardly notice the interruption, the whole operation by which the ascent
of the Zig Zag is made being performed so smoothly and expeditiously.
It will be understood that in this mode of ascent or descent the tra-
veller can see portions of the railway immediately above and below
him?that which he is about to travel or that which he has travelled.
In the ascent of the range near Lapstone Hill, a magnificent
panorama gradually comes into sight, and the traveller has a view of
the country to the eastward from the River Nepean?which is imme-
diately under him, and which winds to the north like a steel-blue
ribbon through the light green belt of farms on its banks?across
an expanse of dusky green timber, dotted with villages and farms
right to the coast. The course of the railway across the mountains
has given ample opportunity for the display of engineering skill,
and for the construction of railway works, which must always com-
mand admiration. The scenery is picturesque, savage, and grand,
and in many places terrible to the traveller with weak nerves. It is
something of a sensation, to be called to the window of a railway
carriage to admire a grand view of mountain scenery with lofty
battlements of rock rising from profound depths of forest, and to
realise suddenly the fact that you are rapidly passing close to the
very verge of an almost precipitous descent a thousand feet in depth.
The line here passes round the shoulder of a mountain, and there
crosses a deep gully by a viaduct, and again runs along the summit
of the high land until it descends into Lithgow Valley by a zigzag
similar to that at Lapstone Hill, but, if possible, more striking.


The railway runs close to the old line of road to the One Tree Hill
station, when it turns off to the north-west. There is a tunnel here
worthy of notice, called Watkins?s Tunnel. It is GOO yards in length,
longer than any on the Victorian Railways, and is carried through
solid sandstone rock. There are several tunnels on the line, but
much shorter. These are for the most part lined with freestone,
and brickwork is very little used.
Victorians, and especially Bendigo residents, will read with much
interest the particulars relating to the contract of Mr. P. Higgins on
this line, which portion is very nearly completed. It is fifteen miles
in length, and commences at a point near Mount Victoria, seventy-
seven miles from the Parramatta junction of the railway, and upwards
of ninety miles from Sydney, and ends at a place called Wallerawang,
near the Mudgee road. It is in Mr. Higgins?s contract that the zig
zag into Lithgow Valley occurs. Here there are two reversing
stations, as in the zigzag at Lapstone Hill. The gradient is uni-
form, 1 in 42, and the curves have a radius of Bto 15 chains. There
are three viaducts on the Zig Zag, with seven, eight, and ten arches
respectively, made of freestone, quarry faced. The ballast line is
also freestone. The line has the narrow gauge, 4 feet 8| inches.
After leaving the Bathurst road, the railway passes through some
very wild, barren country, near Mount Clarance, and into Bell?s line
of road. It then decends by the Zig Zag into Lithgow Valley, the
course of which it follows to the Mudgee road, where there is a
station, and where the present terminus of the railway is, about three
miles from Bowenfels. In the valley the railway has three bridges,
each with three stone arches. The railway station here is a single
station, and the quarters of the station-master, who is single also,
are in a separate building. The buildings are very neatly con-
structed of freestone, and all the masonry is set in cement. There
is a general impression here that with reference to these stations the
Sydney Government is making the same blunder as was made in
Victoria, in constructing the railway buildings on too grand a
scale. , ,
The discomfort of travelling on this line is severely felt by a
Victorian, who has been used to a different system. The Sydney
Government do not rent any portion of the stations for the sale of
liquors and refreshments, and private enterprise has in very few
instances stepped in to supply this want. The authorities here
would seem to belong to the Teetotal Society, judging from the
rigid manner in which they have set their faces against the sale of
any liquors at their railway stations. I can speak from personal
experience, however, when I say that the legislators and wealthy
men take good care that their enjoyments are not interfered with,
for they provide themselves with an abundance of creature comforts
on the line. The inconvenience, as usual, falls most heavily on the
class of poorer travellers, who are less prepared for any privations of


this kind. The Sydney authorities proscribe licenses for eating and
drinking at their railway stations, and the Victorians proscribe
Sunday travelling, each no doubt, as Butler says in Hudibras,
? Compound for sins they are inclined to,
By damning those they have no mind to.?
This grievance on the Sydney railways is aggravated at Lithgow
Valley. Here resides one Andrew Brown, a hard-headed, self-willed
Scotsman, who, as the fates or the favouritism of Governments in
past years willed it, became possessed of the land on each side of
the Mudgee road. He has certainly been an enterprising man, for I
remember eighteen years ago that he had a flour mill in operation,
worked by a water wheel, turned by a stream of water diverted from
the mountain valleys, and carried for several miles in an open cutting
to perform its task. As I have said, this gentleman owns all the
land in the vicinity of the railway station, and he will not sell any
of it, or lease a portion, for the erection of an hotel. The nearest
public-house is nearly three miles off, at Bowenfels, and there is
absolutely no place where either accommodation or refreshment can
be obtained near the railway station. If you miss the train or the
coach, or are too early for either, you are houseless and homeless, and,
as the place is high above the sea, the weather is nearly always cold
at night, and very often showery.
After the line leaves this interesting place?which, however, has
better prospects in store when the rich coal seams in its vicinity are
worked?it passes over Walker?s River by a bridge of eight arches,
and two or three miles further on by another bridge, with the same
number of arches, over the Middle River. The work is, as usual, of
masonry, set in cement, and of the best description. A little
further on, we came to the Morangaroo tunnel, of twelve chains in
length, through the shoulder of a sandstone range, lined as usual
with freestone. Beyond that there is a cutting in sandstone rock
eighty feet deep, carried on for a quarter of a mile, and then two
cuttings of less depth, over a mile in length. Further on is
another tunnel under the Mudgee road, two and a half chains in
length. After this, the road again passes over the railway for the
last time by a bridge, and the line turns to the west. It soon
meet?s Cox?s River, which is passed on a very fine viaduct of
seventeen arches, all segments of circles except that immediately
over the stream, which is an ellipse with a span of fifty-six feet.
This viaduct is made of a fine sandstone conglomerate, which is said
to harden by exposure to the weather, and to be very durable. Near
this is Wallerawang, the residence of Mr. Barton, who was one of
the surveyors on the line, and who married the daughter and heiress
of Mr. Walker, of Wallerawang. His property comprises the land
round the railway station, a mile further on, which will be
the junction of the Mudgee road with the railway. It is said


that he will imitate the illiberal policy of Mr. Brown in refusing to
allow any hotel to be erected near the station, but this I do not
believe. The railway station is at Piper?s Flat, and here ends Mr.
Higgins?s contract. It is a handsome two-storied stone building, the
upper rooms being intended as the residence of the station-master.
There is a moderately-sized goods shed erected of corrugated iron.
A new road, well metalled, one and a half miles long, formed by Mr.
Higgins, connects the station with the present Mudgee road, and
passes over Cox?s Paver by a substantial bridge. Of course there is
the usual proportion of culverts, or rather more than the usual pro-
portion, from 3 feet to 10 feet by 12 feet. Mr. Higgins expects to
finish the works in a couple of months. The amount of the contract
is over �300,000, and it comprises the heaviest and most difficult on
the line. So far as I could judge from personal observation, and
from public report, the work has been performed in the most
satisfactory manner. It is faithful and substantial, and where
appearances could be consulted, as in the viaducts and bridges, it is
elegant and handsome, the proportions being symmetrical and graceful,
and the work tastefully executed. There is but one opinion here,
and that is that this contract reflects the highest credit upon the
contractors. I believe that the contracts for the completion of the
railway to Bathurst, some thirty miles further on, are in course of
being carried out, and that railway communication between this town
and Sydney will soon be an accomplished fact.

THE ROAD TO MUDGEE.
Railway communication from Sydney to the westward at present
terminates at Lithgow Valley, and the traveller who wishes to go
further can go by Cobb and Co.?s coaches either to Bathurst, to the
west, or to Mudgee to the north-west. When the railway is com-
pleted to the former place, he must still depend upon the coaches,
unless he walks or rides, for conveyance to Mudgee; and there is
every prospect that this will be the case for years to come, for the
New South Wales Government is not likely to be in a hurry to con-
struct more railways in this direction. Not to speak of the difficult
mountainous country through which a railway to Mudgee must be
carried, there is not sufficient traffic to justify the expenditure, and
little prospect of this traffic materially increasing, unless diamond
washing is developed into a permanent industry. The distance from
Lithgow Valley to Mudgee is eighty miles, by one of the worst roads
over which it has been my misfortune to travel. This distance will


be shortened about seven or eight miles when the station at Waller-
awang is opened for traffic, which will be in a few weeks. In Lith-
gow Valley there is a tweed manufactory, as well as a flour-mill, the
property of Mr. Andrew Brown, to whom I have already alluded.
I paid this manufactory a visit, and found a considerable number of
persons, male and female, employed in the various operations re-
quired to convert wool into woollen cloth. The machinery is turned
by water power. I can offer no opinion as to the quality of the
machinery or the excellence of the operations, but I can speak in
the highest terms of the cloth produced, which keeps up the high
standard of the old Sydney tweeds. The cloth is well made, soft
and strong, and with an even surface, and is very popular in the
neighbourhood. I believe the undertaking gives a fair return upon
the capital invested. The success of a woollen factory in a village
ninety miles away from the coast, where there are literally no
customers, is worthy of special notice, and may furnish a valuable
hint to some of us.
The evening train, which leaves Sydney about five o?clock, arrives
at Lithgow Valley between ten and eleven, and is usually, so the
coachdrivers say, behind time. The Mudgee coach starts on its
arrival with the passengers and mails over a road on which travelling
in the daytime is wretched enough, but in the night is excruciating.
Like most Victorians who dwelt upon the goldfields before railways
were formed, I had an intimate acquaintance with coach travelling in
all its phases of development by day and by night, and it never struck
me that I had anything new to learn on the New South Wales roads.
My trip on the Mudgee road undeceived me with a vengeance. I
never before experienced anything like it. The present coaches,
which are said to be a great improvement upon those in use up to a
recent date, are similar to the Victorian coaches of Cobb and Co.
They carry six passengers inside and four or five outside, and are
remarkably strong, as they require to be. As they carry the mails,
they are bound to time, and the comfort of passengers is a secondary
consideration. The road has received very little attention in the
way of making from anybody, and is just what a track over stony
ground cut up for a score of years would be. For twenty or thirty
miles it consists of sand and rocks intermingled, over which the coach
is driven as fast as the horses can drag it. The result is a continu-
ous series of jolts, which must be felt to be appreciated, and which
in weak persons would likely cause internal injuries. During this
period of suffering, if the wind follows the coach, there is a constant
atmosphere of dust quite equal to the best Sandhurst specimen. A
fellow passenger agreed with me that a sentence to travel to and
from Mudgee in the mail coaches would be a far more effectual
punishment than six months? imprisonment. The offender who
once experienced it would carefully avoid the risk of being subjected to
such a treat again. We had two females and two children among the


passengers. After one stage, during which I sat on the box seat, when
the coach drew up at the hotel we found the children with their mouths
cut and bleeding, and the mother crying bitterly. The driver was
very civil and very sorry, but he pleaded that he was bound to time.
During the remainder of the journey I took a seat inside, and per-
formed the part of the good Samaritan for the children as well as I
was able. It is hard to say whether a seat inside or outside is pre-
ferable during the night. The driver has paths and short cuts of
his own through the forest, and the passenger on the box seat is con-
stantly engaged in a mental calculation of the odds in favour of run-
ning foul of innumerable stumps which he sees flying past, or dash-
ing laeadlong against the trees through which he can see no road until
in the midst of them. The leader of the team, however, follows the
twists and turns of the bush road with unerring accuracy; and
though we graze the very bark of the trees, still on we go, frequently
at full gallop, and the driver is quite unconscious of doing anything
wonderful. He admits, however, when questioned, that there is risk
of accident, but says he must face it and trust to fortune to get
through.* The night coach travels from Lithgow Valley to Barnaby?s
public-house, thirty-five miles, and the day coach between this and
Mudgee, forty-five miles. Some portions of the road have been
formed, but these are few and far between. Telegraph wires run
along the road to Mudgee, and thence to Wellington and other places.
Along the line of railway, over the mountains, the telegraph posts are
of cast iron, and their slender and elegant appearance contrasts
favourably with that of wooden posts. Along this road, however,
the latter come into use again.
The Mudgee road passes over the table land separating the eastern
and western waters. The geological formation of the country is
very interesting. As a rule, for thirty miles from Lithgow Valley,
on the road towards Mudgee, on the right hand you have the
carboniferous sandstone cliffs, square-topped ; while on the left you
have the rounded and peaked hills of trap-rock, and of the Silurian
formation. I was informed that in several places here the carbon-
iferous rocks rest on the granite, and near Wallerawang I noticed an
outcrop of granite rock where not a mile away to the eastward
towered the horizontal strata of sandstone cliffs. Near Cherrytree
Hill ?which, as the driver humorously remarked, was no hill,
but a good old-fashioned mountain?some of the hills presented
the remarkable appearance of the vertical slate formation, topped
by horizontal layers of sandstone. Along this road, near Cullen-
Bullen and Bullen-Bullen, we pass some of the head waters of the
* In the Sydney Morning Herald of the 4th March, shortly after this
letter appeared, I observed a paragraph to the effect that the Mudgee
coach was capsized by collision with a tree, and the driver, Amos Butler,
was seriously hurt by the wheel of the coach falling on his chest.


famous Turon. The public-houses here are, as a rule, wretched
shanties, and have a sordid and poverty-stricken appearance, very
different from what they presented during the palmy days of the rush
to the Turon in 1851-2.- After leaving Hurd?s public-house, known
formerly as Keenan?s, the road winds round the Crown Ridge, and,
if there is light enough, the traveller will obtain a view of a grand
piece of scenery. There is a singular formation here, called Caper-
tee which is a hollow or hole in the mountains several miles in
diameter, and nearly two thousand feet below the tops of the ranges.
It is said that there is only one way into and out of this pit, and a
packhorse can hardly travel it. Some enterprising person of the
Robinson Crusoe genus has a farm at the bottom of this dell, but i
am not aware what success his enterprise has met. Out of this
tremendous gulf, on the west side, rises the Crown Ridge almost
perpendicularly, to a great height. The road, which up to this has
passed over pretty level table land, is continued round the shoulder
of this mountain by a cutting wide enough to allow two vehicles to
pass each other. Over this perilous ledge the horses are driven at
full gallop, just to give the passengers a sufficient sensation ot the
terrible to heighten the sublimity of the scenery. It is only fair to
the reader, however, to say that the outer edge of the road is securely
protected by a three-railed fence, which, according to a legend current,
was placed there after a dreadful accident, when a coach with several
passengers dashed over the edge of the precipice, and rolled into the
depths below. At this portion of the road the spectator has the
mountain towering up several hundred feet over him on the one side,
and the ground abruptly sloping away into the profound depths
beneath, where the sight is baffled by the dusky foliage. Just acrosss
and towering above this gulch, the square outlines of the sandstone
ranges appear; and if they are lighted up by the level beams of the
setting sun with a gold and purple glory above the sombre shadows
of the gulf beneath, the effect is indescribably grand and beautiful.
After losing sight of this place, both driver and passengers remained
for some time silent. The view of Capertee was obtained on the
return from Mudgee; going to that place we passed it during the
Barnaby?s, where the passengers halt for meals, the country is
open and shows signs of cultivation. Beyond this, we pass into the
gold district, crossing the Running Stream, which is the upper por-
tion of the Turon, and then passing over Cherrytree Hill, up which
the passengers walk, and the horses have as much as they can do to
draw the empty coach. From the bottom of this hill on the east to
the�bottom on the west the distance is five miles. On the east the
road up the incline is cut through carboniferous shales, with indica-
tions of coal; on the west the road cuttings show the inclined slates
of the Silurian formation. The gullies on the mountain are remark-
able for the multitude of exceedingly tall, straight, and apparently


slender trees, rising from the well-watered depths and towering up
to light and air. The manner in which the driver, George Wilkins
?he deserves to be distinguished?drove the coach down the steep
western slopes of Cherrytree Hill was something to witness. He
said he was making up time, but I had some reason to think he was
showing off in the presence of Victorians, who were accustomed to
see Yankee drivers, about whom George, who is a native, was very
curious. ? Did we ever see Yankee drivers hold the reins of four
horses in one hand 1 No, they held them that way,? taking the reins
in both hands. The road was good, having been made at great ex-
pense, but the pace was that of horses that had bolted. Had the
break given way, the coroner would have had some employment at
the nearest hotel to Cherrytree. The driver, while we were dash-
ing down the slope through the fresh morning air, apropos of the
occasion, and to make us comfortable, told us of a fatal accident that
had happened on the Bathurst road in this way, by which the driver
was killed. ?He would have got all right to the bottom of the hill,?
said George, ? had it not been for one of those logs left by the road
contractors leaning against the side of a cutting, by which the coach
was capsised.? George was very communicative, and narrated some
of his experiences with bushrangers, when sticking-up was rife some
years ago. At Aaron?s Pass, another steep hill, he showed us where
a driver addicted to ? blowing? was twice stuck-up. His account of
the second occasion illustrates the social condition of the population,
and shows how it was that the bushrangers so long escaped detection.
After his first adventure, when driving the coach up the same place,
a young woman, who was the only passenger, asked him to point out
the place where he was stuck up. He did so, and commenced to
vapour about his bringing the robbers to punishment, and being able
to swear to them. The very next day he was stuck up by the same
gang in the same place, when driving alone, and tied to a tree where
he remained all night, the bushrangers telling him that they did this as
a warning to him to hold his tongue in future, and not indulge in
threats about identifying them. If they heard any more of it, he would
suffer worse next time. He took the hint, and observed a very dis-
creet silence ever after. George had been stuck up himself, and
forced to drive the coach with Her Majesty?s mails, with which the
bushrangers seemed to be quite familiar, up to the top of a very
steep hill, where they examined the mail bags at leisure, two of the
four standing guard with loaded guns over the driver and pas-
sengers. He had the satisfaction afterwards of identifying one of the
robbers, who was captured by the police at one of the public-houses.
The country about here is a confused tangle of mountains and
ravines, and any good rider acquainted with it could set the police at
defiance.
The road, after descending Aaron?s Pass, meets the Cudgegong
Elver, which flows along a pretty valley, hemmed in by high moun-


tains. The town of Cudgegong, about twenty miles from Mudgee,
is very small, but has two public-houses, and a public school, a stone
building, which is very conspicuously placed on a hill. At various
places along the river we observe a few persons digging for gold, and
at a place called Appletree Flat, which is a small valley between
steep hills, where a creek joins the Cudgegong, there is a consider-
able population located, and a number of stores and refreshment
places. The diggers, however, talk as usual of the place being
worked out, but agree that it has been very rich. At a refreshment
place along the road the owner showed us a handful of stones, the
size of small beans, which appeared to be white zircons. Small
rubies and sapphires were plentiful, he said, but there were no
diamonds there. Near Cudgegong township is the cinnabar mine,
which is said to be very rich. I saw some of the ore, but could not
spare the time to pay a visit to the locality. As we approached Mudgee,
the mountains receded, the country became more level and open,
and on every side were farms and enclosed fields. The land here is
admirably adapted for agricultural purposes, and the district is one
of the most productive in the colony. We drove up to the Koyal
Mail Hotel, kept by Mr. Markwell, about two o?clock in the after-
noon, having been doing penance in the coach ever since half-past
eleven the previous night, with the exception of the brief intervals
allowed for breakfast and for changing horses.
No. VII.
MUDGEE TO THE DIAMOND MINES.
Mudgee is a thriving township, containing four or five thousand in-
habitants. It is pleasantly situated in the midst of a considerable
extent of open level country, through which the Cudgegong or Mud-
gee river flows, and which is girt on all sides, except the north-west,
by mountains. On the south-east and south there is the massive
peak of Mount Bocoble and the range of the Meroo mountains, and
on the east and north-east there are the fantastic outlines of the
Cudgegong ranges. The valley or plain in which Mudgee is situated
is ten to fifteen miles wide, and the greater portion of it is under
cultivation. The river passes close to the township on the north, and
is crossed by a wooden bridge. The situation and surroundings of
Mudgee somewhat resemble those of Kyneton,and I believe that leads
of gold will be found in the immediate vicinity, as there is now reason
to & believe will be the case at the latter town. Mudgee is well laid
out, with wide streets crossing each other at right angles. The
main road is about three-quarters of a mile long. There are two or


three banks, fine handsome buildings of two stories, three or four
churches of the usual style, a goodly number of excellent shops and
hotels, and some spacious stores. Brick is the prevailing building
material, and shops and houses of two stories are common. The
town has a thriving well-to-do appearance, without the bustle and
activity of the towns on the Victorian goldfields. Indeed Mudgee
cannot be reckoned a goldfields township. It existed as a town of
some importance before gold was found in the colony, and it is very
evident that it is even now chiefly dependent upon agriculture and
pastoral pursuits. One sees very few indications that he is in the
vicinity of goldfields, and the people as a rule do not appear to
appreciate very highly either gold diggings or gold diggers. There
are two newspapers of course?one published twice a week, I think,
and the other a weekly. The press reflects the character of the
people, and does not bestow much attention upon the mineral
resources of the district. The gold diggings are recognised, and that
is all; but there does not seem to be any warm or active interest
taken in their development or in the welfare of the miners. As to
the diamond digging and washing, which pursuit is making Mudgee
and the Cudgegong famous elsewhere, in no place did I find so little
interest taken in it as in Mudgee itself. Both papers have almost
ignored it. They have occasionally chronicled the finding of
diamonds, or, as they term it, the ? rumoured finding,? but in such a
way as to lead the reader to infer that it is not unlikely that the
whole thing is a hoax, the creation of smart Victorian sharebrokers to
raise the wind, by imposing upon public gullibility. The manager
of one of the diamond-washing companies at the Cudegong on one
occasion brought into Mudgee a fine parcel of a hundred and fifty
diamonds, and with natural elation exhibited them at the banks and
chief stores, and at the newspaper offices, as an unmistakable proof
of the richness of the district. The effect produced may be under-
stood from the fact that in the next publication of one of the papers
there was a short paragraph, very guardedly worded, stating that they
had been shown a parcel of stones said to be diamonds, and to have
been found at Two Mile Flat. The manager was indignant at the
implied doubt, but he was coolly asked how did they know they
were diamonds or had been found as stated. When expressing my
surprise to the proprietor of one of the papers that there should be
so much indifference manifested in reference to a matter of so much
scientific as well as commercial interest, I was met by the plea that
it was thought unwise to give the subject any prominence for fear
of causing a rush of diggers, which might be followed by much dis-
appointment and suffering. It is a fact that at the time of my visit,
when nearly twelve months had elapsed since the discovery of
diamonds, and when several companies had been regularly obtaining
gems, no reporter from either the local or other papers had visited
the locality to give an account of it.


It must be difficult for intelligent persons at a distance to under-
stand this indifference and apathy on the part, not only of the in-
habitants, but of the public journals, of the district in reference to
the discovery and the development of valuable mineral resources.
Indeed, the strange want of interest in reference to the discovery of
diamonds in the Cudgegong district is not confined to' the press of
Mudgee, but is shared by the press of Sydney itself; and it has been
reserved for the correspondent of a provincial journal in Victoria to
furnish to the world the first description of the diamond district of
New South Wales, and of the operations that are carried on for the
extraction of diamonds from the strata in which they have been em-
bedded. Scientific and commercial travellers, such as Tavernier,
John Mawe, and recently Captain Burton, have at great personal risk,
trouble, and expense visited the known diamond districts of Hin-
dostan and Brazil in order to obtain accurate information about the
localities in which diamonds were found, and the manner in which they
were obtained; and the particulars these travellers have furnished
have been perused with the utmost interest by all classes of readers.
The discovery of diamonds in Australia has excited general curiosity
and interest throughout the civilised world, and yet those in the
vicinity of the place where they have been found appear to regard it
with less interest than they do the probable result of the next races.
The discovery has also caused quite a commotion among diamond
dealers and scientific men in Europe?among the former because they
dread the depreciation of the value of the gems by this new disco-
very, and among the latter because the dogmatic assertions of some
of them have been proved to be altogether wrong. By a recent mail
we heard that, in consequence of the discovery of diamonds in such
quantities near Mudgee, Professor Tennant, who is an eminent
mineralogist, had been induced to reconsider his expressed opinions
in reference to the non-existence of the diamond rock in Australia !
It is lamentable to read of such fiascos on the part of scientific
men. This opinion of Professor Tennant?s was shared by some
of our leading scientific men in Victoria and New South Wales,
and this in the face of the undeniable fact that several diamonds had
been found at the Ovens. When the discovery was made of
diamonds near Mudgee it was currently reported in Melbourne that
one of them, who had already distinguished himself by absurd
scientific dogmatism about the gold in quartz reefs giving out at
certain depths, denied the possibility of the existence of diamonds
in Australia, so far as known; and asserted that, if any true
diamonds had been found, they had been placed where found by
some scheming speculators. Dr. Bleasdale, it is said, produced a
small handful of the gems to the confusion of the other doctor.
What reliance can be placed henceforth on the opinions of these
gentlemen, who venture to dogmatise as they do on such imper-
fect knowledge as they evidently possess? What is the use of


this country spending so much as it does annually in large
salaries to these scientific gentlemen who are worse than useless,
for they positively discourage enterprise in the development of
the mineral wealth of the country. I regarded the discontinuance
of the geological survey of the colony by Mr. Selwyn, and of the
production of the geological maps, as a discredit to the M � Culloch
Government, but such instances as we have of the gross blunders and
imperfect information of our scientific men almost lead to the con-
clusion that it was perfectly justifiable. To return from this digres-
sion. The importance of this discovery at the Cudgegong, in a scien-
tific as well as in a commercial point of view, must be evident to the
intelligent reader. It is now twelve months since the discovery
was made, and yet there has been no description given of the
district, or of the conditions under which diamonds are obtained;
nor has the New South Wales Government given to the world any
official account of the geological formation of the country, or indeed,
as far as lam aware, taken any notice of the subject whatever. It is
certainly surprising that the Sydney Morning Herald , the leading
journal of New South Wales, has not long ere this made the world
familiar with the diamond diggings of Cudgegong, but so it is. I
have reason to believe, however, that this oversight will speedily be
remedied by the proprietors of that journal.* I understand too
that Professor Thomson, of Sydney, has made several visits to the
Cudgegong, and has collected a good deal of information respecting
the geological formation of the country, which is remarkably inter-
esting in many respects. I shall have occasion to refer to this gentle-
man?s opinions in a subsequent portion of my remarks.
At Mudgee I found that the nearest diamond workings were at
a place called Two Mile Flat, twenty-two miles distant to the west-
ward, and that the only regular conveyance was by means of a
spring cart which visited that place twice a week, carrying passengers
and parcels. When the rush to the Two Mile was at its height con-
veyance was more regular and speedy, but now that the passenger
traffic had fallen off there was nothing better than this spring cart,
which took a circuitous route by other places, and could not be
depended on to make the journey quickly. The best course was to
get a trap, and find out the place myself. Accordingly, I hired ahorse
and buggy, and started early the next morning, with the usual unin-
telligible instructions to ? keep the road to the left till you reach the
orchard on a hill, and then take the track to the right about a
quarter of a mile,? &c. For seven or eight miles out of Mudgee
the road was well made and the country level, and the rate of
progress was highly satisfactory. Then the country became hilly,
and I found that the horse had evidently been accustomed to level
* The reader will observe subsequently that this neglect can no longer be
charged against the Herald.


roads, and to no harder work than drawing about a family party at
a lazy pace. I had been told to give him plenty of whip, but I soon
saw, by the rate of consumption of the lash, that I hadn?t whip
enough to last the journey. There were some very steep ranges to
pass over, and I had to get out, and not only to walk up the hills,
but to drag the horse after me. However, I made up for the delay
when descending the ranges at the other side at a pace which
threatened the total demolition of the vehicle on the rocky road;
and for the last five or six miles to Two-Mile the country w 7 as as
level as a bowling green. There are only two public-houses on the
road, and I met only three or four persons. A great deal of the
best land is enclosed, but evidently by large proprietors, and as far
as population and dwellings are concerned the country is desolate.
When passing through so much fine country lying waste, or held by
monopolists, I could not but think what a blessing for New South
Wales would the 42nd clause of Grant?s Land Act be, administered
by Mr. Grant. A correct idea of the geological formation of the
country, where the rocks are covered with so much alluvial soil,
can hardly be obtained by the traveller who passes rapidly over
it. Where the rocks were visible they were chiefly metamorphic
slates and sandstones of the gold formation with thin quartz veins.
Here and there the soil was strewed with quartz gravel and boulders,
and blue slate cropped out on the slopes. The high range I had to
pass over ?called the Big Hill, which is the usual name at the diggings
for the highest and biggest hill on a road ?appeared to me to consist of
trap-rock, masses of diorite and fragments of felstone lying on the top
and sides. On another hill I found granite boulders, but whether this
was the constituent rock or not, I could not ascertain. On descending
into the valley leading to the Two-Mile, near a small farm, I came
again among the gold rocks, and towards the township passed through
gold workings, where a lead had been followed and worked some time
previously. The headings were somewhat similar to those of the
old Epsom Lead at Bendigo, heaps of rounded discoloured quartz
pebbles, once embedded in cement, lying about. As I advanced, the
hills on either side began to present a bare appearance, and the
valley was divested of trees, showing that a considerable population
had at one time been located here. After passing the usual out-
skirts of a diggings township, I reached the modest hamlet of Tw ro-
mile, and pulled up at Driscoll?s Hotel, a commodious and very
comfortable weatherboard building with a verandah, which had
evidently seen busier and more prosperous times than the present.
Here I found attention and civility combined with moderate charges,
and these in the very centre of the diamond district ?the Australian
Diamantina.


No. VIII
THE CUDGEGONG DIAMOND DISTRICT.
THE MVDGEE DIAMOND COMPANY.
The hamlet of Two-mile Flat does not at present contain more than
a score of houses, but there are evidences of a considerable popula-
tion having at one time been located here. There is one thorough-
fare in it which may by courtesy be termed a street, in which are
two or three shops. The valley in which it is situated is too con-
fined, perhaps, to allow of this hamlet developing into a large town,
and yet who can tell what may be the future of this at present
insignificant place, should the diamond district of Cudgegong
develope into anything like that of Tejuco, in Brazil? As you look
towards 'the river there is a hill on the left, sloping down to the
flat, on the side of which a lead of gold has been worked for some
distance. This hill is covered by masses of basalt, and the shafts,
which are twenty or thirty feet deep, are sunk close to the rock.
The washing-stuff and the headings thrown out from these holes are
remarkable for the burnt blackened appearance of the cement and
pebbles. The cement is like ironstone, with embedded rounded
pebbles of quartz and trap. It resembles what, in the Brazil
diamond districts?according to Captain Burton?is called ? canga,?
and in this ironstone conglomerate diamonds and other precious
stones have been found. Mr, Norman Taylor, a gentleman who
was formerly on Mr. Selwyn?s geological staff in Victoria, and who
was for a time managing one of the diamond companies, collected a
quantity of this conglomerate, and burnt it in a large fire, so as to
reduce it to powder. He informed me that the result of his experi-
ment was the finding of two small diamonds?which however were
rendered almost valueless by the roasting they had undergone. He
showed me a piece of the same conglomerate with a fragment of
sapphire embedded in it. The conglomerate varies in appearance, some
of it resembling ordinary pudding-stone cement, like that of the White
Hills at Bendigo?yellow, red, and whitey-brown?in appearance.
Some of it was of a greenish brimstone colour, but what this was
caused by I could not ascertain. The quartz pebbles here had all the
appearance of having been embedded in a conglomerate cemented
by iron. Among the ordinary constituents of the cement ?the
quartz, whinstone, and sandstone pebbles, and sand and gravel?l
found jasper pebbles and pieces of agate. In Captain Burton?s
account of the diamond mines of Brazil, he refers to this conglo-
merate as the true diamond matrix, or, in the Portuguese language,
? formagao.?
A drive of two or three miles along the south bank of the Cudge-
gong brought me to the head-quarters of the Mudgee Gold and


Diamond Washing Company, on Jordan?s Flat. The banks of the
river are like terraces above the stream, and between it and the rise
towards the mountains, which hem in the valley on either side. This
valley is in many places very beautiful, and I am not surprised that
the rich alluvial flats along the river have passed into the hands of
private persons I had almost said into the hands of monopolists.
The width of the valley varies, and the channel of the river, fifteen
or twenty yards in breadth, winds down it sometimes in the centre,
and oftener inclining on one side or the other towards the mountains?
leaving on the other side broad belts of alluvial flats. These rich
flats, the very eyes of the country, have all passed into private hands,
and figure on the map as separate allotments, from 200 acres to 2000,
owned by some members of the Rouse or Cox family. The
gong River for miles up and down has been taken up in the same
manner, and this accounts for the fact that a district so rioh in gold,
to say nothing of diamonds, is almost untouched, and without popu-
lation. One can hardly blame those who managed thus practically
to obtain possession of a whole district by picking out and purchas-
ing every choice bit of ground to be got; but what is to be said of
the officials of New South Wales, who thus, either from negligence
or design, allowed so much valuable public territory to Ibecome
alienated, and to pass into the hands of half a dozen capitalists, with-
out the State receiving the full value of the land 1 As might be sup-
posed under such circumstances, the diggers constantly & come into
collision with the private proprietors. When the latter hold all the
choice portions of land, of course no one is likely to interfere with
the land not sold, either for pastoral or agricultural purposes. But
gold is not confined to such alluvial flats, and the diggers have
managed to find places to work yet in the hands of the Crown.
Constant disputes, however, arise, and the result is that the diggers
are confined to the bed of the river, in places too rugged to tempt
the land monopolist, or to the leads that pass through hills or slopes.
All the alluvial flats on the Cudgegong that I saw for many miles
were untouched by the gold digger, and there is every reason to
believe that these are as rich as those of the Turon have been proved
to be. The Mudgee Company has got the right to work these flats
and leads for miles of the river from Two-mile Flat to Reedy Creek
and the gold alone, without taking into consideration the diamonds?
should give excellent returns, if the ground is worked with ordinary
skill. If this portion of the river was open to the diggers, there
would soon be a rush of several thousands, and a continuous lead
of gold would be worked down the valley of the Cudgegong. As I
drove up the river, before I knew that the land was in private hands,
I could not help wondering why this bar, and that promising bend?
and this extensive flat had not been wrought, when the auriferous
indications were so striking; and why workings appeared to be
confined to the hills and sterile slopes. The river, with its surround-
c 2


ings, very much resembles the Turon as I saw it in 1851, before the
valley was rooted up by the gold diggers. The stream of water, the
banks, the breadth of the valley, and height of the hills, are all very
similar, and the geological formation is the same. The reader can
understand how little it has been disturbed by mining operations,
when I mention that the running stream is quite clear, and the very
large waterholes are full of fish. I passed several beautiful reaches
in the river, where the water was still clear and deep, and the banks
were blooming with verdure. Indeed, the country everywhere was
wonderfully green and luxuriant, the result of the frequent showers of
rain, and the contrast with the brown withered appearance of the
country in Victoria, Avhen I returned, was remarkable. The flats
through which the road passed were covered with rich green sward,
and they preserved the same appearance as far as I went, nine or ten
miles up* to Guntawang, the residence of Mr. R. Rouse. On the
road to the Mudgee Company?s works I passed a locomotive engine,
which I found belonged to the company, and was on its way to Jor-
dan?s Flat. I was kindly welcomed by Mr. Hewitt, the manager of
the company, who was engaged in quartz mining on Bendigo some
years ago, and is well and favourably known to many in this district,
as well as at Wood?s Point, where he was a mining manager for
some time. Mr. Hewitt had his hands full with the arrival of the
engine, but I met Mr. Herman Taylor here, to whom I had letters
of introduction, and in a very short time I was perfectly at home,
engaged in an animated discussion about the diamond matrix, and
energetically breaking stones and turning over headings and tail-
ings in search of specimens.
Jordan?s Flat is admirably adapted for a site for the company?s
workings. It is pretty extensive, about half a mile long and a couple
of hundred yards wide, and it is high above the river floods. An old
shepherd?s hut of Mr. G. Rouse?s has been converted into a tolerably
comfortable dwelling-place for the manager and one or two of the
workmen employed by him. Close to this is a workshop, a black-
smith?s shop, and a stable, which at present accommodates only one
horse. In the blacksmith?s shop is a large pair of bellows with
confirmed asthma, and a wheezing which every now and then rises
into a wail as melancholy as that of a banshee. Both the carpenter
and blacksmith were busily engaged in their avocations, the former,
I think, finishing a drum for winding, and the latter sharpening
tools and making ironwork. When Mr. Hewitt was at leisure we
went to see the shaft he was sinking, a couple of hundred yards off,
at Ae point of the hill towards the bend of the river. Hear this,
on the hill side, a lead had formerly been worked by the gold
diggers. As Mr. Rouse is lord of the flats, they have been driven to
the ranges, and here, just where the flat rises to the hill, they dis-
covered some profitable gold deposits at a depth of a few feet; the
lead striking towards the hill, and gradually deepening. It was


followed and wrought very successfully for a hundred yards or so,
and in some places was very rich. When it reached a depth of
about 25 feet the lead came suddenly to a termination, being stopped
by a dyke of basalt which baffled farther efforts on the part of the
diggers. Mr. Hewitt had found the tailings from it, which had been
washed in the river close by, rich in diamonds. An old woman and
a boy living in the neighbourhood were in the habit of washing the
tailings in a cradle and tin dish, and they had obtained twenty of
these gems. Mr. Hewitt himself, from a moderate quantity passed
through one of Hunt?s machines, obtained twenty-one diamonds. It
struck him that the basalt dyke which interfered with the de-
velopment of the lead was not very extensive; that the lost lead
must pass under the spur of the range leading to the river,
and that it would be a capital thing for the company if it could be
found again. But the spur consists of basalt, hard bluestone,
which here, as in so many places on the Cudgegong, crops out on
the hills. To sink a shaft from the top of the spur in the probable
direction of the lead would be a very costly undertaking. Towards
the river, however, the rock rises abruptly from the sloping ground,
and here Mr. Hewitt determined to sink his shaft in search of the
lost lead. He did not expect to find it at the bottom of tbe shaft,
but at some distance from it, under the spur. When I visited the
locality the shaft was bottomed at 76 feet. For the first sixteen
feet the sinking was through loose and broken basalt, then for forty-
four feet it was through hard compact basalt. Under this a coarse
sand-drift was reached, through which the shaft was carried for six-
teen feet to the bed-rock. I shall have occasion to refer to this
coarse quartz sand, which is a special feature in diamond dis-
tricts. The bed-rock, which is clay slate, was found, as expected,
dipping towards the hill. Gold was found on the bottom in small
quantity. Mr. Hewitt intended driving in the direction of the dip,
and he was sanguine in his expectation of finding the lead. Others
however did not agree with him, and thought the search for the
lost lead hopeless, and the sinking of the shaft an expensive folly.
I was disposed to think that the manager w T as justified in putting
down the shaft, but I could not deny that the chances were not in
his favour. Still it was worth while to try, for the recovery of
this lead would give the company a capital start. It will be seen
that a great deal depended on the result of Mr. Hewitt?s enterprise,
and I was much gratified since my return to see a telegram from
that gentleman to the effect that the lead had been found, and both
gold and diamonds had been obtained. The loose sand-drift was a
difficulty, and would necessitate careful driving, and probably
slabbing the drives.


No. IX
THE CUDGEGONG DIAMOND DISTRICT.
THE ANCIENT EIYER BED ?HUNT?S MACHINE.
The lead which has thus been struck by Mr. Hewitt at the spur of
the hill, is evidently a portion of the ancient river bed. It is be-
tween thirty and forty feet above the present channel of the river,
and at this place is about an eighth of a mile distant from it. This
ancient channel of the river has been struck in various parts of the
valley, and has always been found to be rich both in gold and
diamonds. So far as I could ascertain there had been no attempt
to search for diamonds near the present bed of the river, on the bars
and flats of a recent formation, which contain gold, and no doubt
also contain diamonds. Probably the ancient leads are richer in
gems than the modern, but there is no reason to suppose that the
latter are barren, for throughout the course of the river there are
many localities where it is evident that the older deposits have been
swept away by water action, and now form a portion of the present
river drift some thirty feet below. Whenever the various changes
that have taken place have not obliterated the ancient river bed,
this will be found on either side of the river, on the slopes of the
ranges, or forming the tops of low cement hills, like our White
Hills, which are in like manner the remnants of the bed of an
ancient river of great size and volume of water, probably flowing
from Mount Alexander towards the valley of the Murray. In the
Turon there were similar gold workings along the valley, twenty or
thirty feet above the river, which were discovered by the diggers
when the floods drove them out of the bed claims. On the Cudge-
gong, as far as I could see, the diggings seemed to be confined to
the workings of this old deposit, and from the cause to which
I have already alluded, the various river flats and bars have
hardly been touched. It is very evident that since this ancient
river bed was formed, great changes have taken place in the
valley of the Cudgegong. I have alluded to the masses of
basalt rock which are seen on the slopes of the hills leading
to the river. This basalt, wherever it came from, must have
been deposited in the valley, probably filling it up to a consider-
able height, long after the formation of the old deposit, which it
overlies in many places, and has probably saved from being washed
away. Other changes in the geological formation and in the features
and drainage of the country must also have taken place, for the de-
tritus in the present river bed contains a much greater variety of
stones than is found in the ancient river drift. The latter consists
chiefly of the ordinary gold rocks, quartz in great variety, pieces
of hard sandstone, hard and soft slate and schist, from the hard


blueslate to pipeclay, pebbles of jasper, and agate, silicified wood and
bone in great variety, and the gem sand containing the diamond,
ruby, topaz, hyacinth, tourmalin, pleonaste, &c. In the present river
drift all these stones are found, but with them are boulders and
pebbles of basalt, whinstone, diorite, and a greater variety of the
altered slates and sandstone in the vicinity. Mr. Norman Taylor,
in a letter addressed to the Australasian some months ago, which
was noticed by another correspondent rather in a carping spirit,
made special reference to the absence of ? Itacolumite,? the rock
which is regarded in Brazil as the matrix of the diamond. He
appeared to be of the same opinion still, and stated that Professor
Thompson agreed with him, I certainly was not able to find the
rock in situ at the Cudgegong in the short time I remained, but
I could not doubt that the extensive deposits of coarse quartz sand
at Jordan?s Flat, and especially at Wialdra Creek, owed their origin
to the disintegration and wearing down of the ? Itacolumite,? which
in the violent geological changes at the Cudgegong has disappeared,
or is concealed from notice at present. However, in the ancient
river drift at Jordan?s Flat I found a fragment of stone that answered
fully to the description given of the soft variety of this rock in
Brazil. I have found the same kind of rock, a micaceous quartzose
schist, of a dull white colour, and very friable, to the north of
Bendigo. Mr. Taylor thought that the stone was merely a fragment
of the ordinary sandstone rock on the goldfields, but I have never
seen any ordinary rock on the goldfields similar to it. It is quite
intelligible that such a rock would be easily worn down, leaving, as
the only sign of its existence, beds of white sand glistening with
mica.
At the bend of the river, below this lead, on Jordan?s Flat, Mr.
Hewitt had one of Hunt?s diamond-washing machines placed near
an old heap of tailings, which he has partially worked, and from
which he obtained several diamonds. The company has another of
Hunt?s machines down the river below Two-mile Flat, where they
have a lease of a thousand yards along the bank, and where Mr.
Hewitt obtained one hundred and fifty diamonds from a waterhole
which he drained. He sank a shaft at this place, but was unable to
keep the water down without the aid of a steam-engine, so that he
had to discontinue operations. At Jordan?s Flat the want of proper
machinery was also felt. Diamonds can be obtained from the heaps
of tailings, but at too great an expense when it takes one man to
pump water into the machine, another to work the plunger, and a
third to shovel the stuff into the hopper. The wisdom of waiting
until an engine is erected which will perform all these operations
more economically, must be admitted, though no doubt share-
holders are impatient for returns. I saw the machine in use when I
was there, and had practical proof of the richness of the tailings
from Jordan?s Lead in gem sand, especially small sapphires and rubies.


There is a large quantity of black sand, which Mr. Taylor states is
chiefly pleonaste; and a great deal of a sparkling yellowish-grey sand,
which no doubt is hyacinthe, a variety of zircon. The diamonds
found here are small, mostly of a straw-colour, perfectly crystallised,
usually in the octahedral form, and free from blemishes.
A description of Hunt?s diamond-washing machine may be in-
teresting, as it has not been tried on Bendigo, and the descriptions I
have read in the papers do not convey a good idea of it. The prin-
ciple of the machine is bringing water in motion to act upon washing
stuff so as to carry away stones, gravel, and sand lighter than diamonds,
leaving behind gems and everything heavier, including gold of course.
The manner in which this principle is applied in this machine is very
beautiful, but here my commendation must stop. There is great
room for improvement in the other portions of the machine, especi-
ally in the mode of supplying the stuff to it. In fact Mr. Hunt?s
idea is yet to be properly carried out for working on a large scale,
and the present machines may be regarded as chiefly useful for pro-
specting. Hunt?s machine may be described as a large box with a
smaller one attached, the smaller being merely an appendage for
working a plunger, and the larger being covered with a perforated
iron top with sides and ends, and one or two bars placed across it.
This receptacle is slightly inclined, and at the upper end there is a
hopper for receiving the washing stuff, which passes through the
hopper grating, and along the incline of the perforated table, until it
is discharged over the lower end. The bars across it are supposed
to arrest the heavier substances in the stuff. The whole operation
takes place on this perforated cover of the box, over which is placed
a wire screen to prevent any pilfering. But what causes the wash-
ing stuff to travel over this table, leaving behind it the heavier
and more valuable portions 1 Herein it is that the principle of the
machine consists. The box underneath the perforated cover is
kept nearly full of water, and the plunger, when worked in the
small compartment communicating with it, forces the water up-
wards through the minute perforations, agitating the gravel and
sand, and gradually carrying them off with the overflow. If the
hand is placed on the perforated top when the plunger is worked,
the action of the water is distinctly felt, like the beating of a
pulse, the rise and fall of the water being so regular. The action
of the water thus rising underneath the gravel has the effect of
partially floating it down the inclined surface, and it can be
regulated with such nicety that quartz whose specific gravity is 2 - 6
can be carried off, while the diamond, with a specific gravity of 3'5,
is retained behind the bars. The principle is very beautiful, but it
scarcely gets justice in these machines, which are not constructed so
as to receive and treat a large quantity of stuff. The hopper too is
very defective, and as the machine is at present constructed there
is too much manipulation required. After the stuff has been


passed through Hunt?s machine, it must not be supposed that all
the trouble is over. When a machine is to be emptied, the wire
covering is taken off, and the surface stones and gravel are carefully
removed. The residuum at the Cudgegong is black with the peculiar
heavy grains of what is termed pleonaste as well as with iron sand.
The portion in the first compartment near the hopper is taken out,
spread upon a flat surface, and examined for gems. The stuff
below the first bar is usually passed again through the machine, so
that any gems which may have been carried over the first bar
may be obtained. Sometimes the residuum in the machine is
washed out in a tin dish, in the same way as washing for gold, but
this is not a very safe method, for diamonds are very apt to slide
over the edge of the dish in panning out the stuff. The best way is
to spread out the stuff over a level surface, and carefully examine it
for any valuable stones, which are usually easily recognised by their
brilliancy, colour, or peculiar shape and appearance. There still
remains the fine silt in the body of the machine to be dealt with.
The perforations in the top which allow the water to rise among the
stuff, allow the fine gold and sand to pass into the chamber below,
which must be cleared out at intervals, the sand being treated for
the recovery of the fine gold.

THE CUDGEGONG DIAMOND DISTRICT.
Jordan?s flat to wialdra creek.
The arrangement made by the originators of the Mudgee Diamond
Company with Mr. George Rouse, who owns so much of the valley
of the Cudgegong, gives the company the right of working Mr.
Rouse?s land for six or seven miles almost continuously along the
river. The whole of this land is situated in that portion of the
Cudgegong where diamonds have been obtained; that is, from the
junction of Wialdra or Reedy Creek down to Two-mile Flat. The
company, as I have previously stated, have also got one thousand
yards of the river below Two-mile Flat, and four hundred yards
below the Government reserve, where the stuff from the Rocky
Ridge was worked. Above this reserve the available ground is held
by Gough?s party, by whom I believe the diamond weighing 51-
carats was found, which was purchased by Mr. Crisp, jeweller, of
Melbourne, sent to England to be cut, and was a short time since
sold for �l6O in Melbourne. It will be seen' that the company
hold some of the most valuable portions of the river, and I believe
that the terms on which the land is held are very moderate, being a


small percentage on the net profits. Diamonds have not yet been
discovered above the junction of Eeedy Creek nor below Hassall?s
Hill, two or three miles below Two-mile Flat; so that, in point of
fact, the company hold the most valuable portion of the river. The
very extent of their ground is a difficulty, for it has led to their
commencing operations in different places, and thus losing all the
advantages of concentrating their efforts upon one place. Thus they
have one of Hunt?s machines at Jordan?s Flat, and another on their
lease of one thousand yards three or four miles down the river. As
I have stated, their land extends up the river to the junction of the
Wialdra or Reedy Creek, three miles above Jordan?s Flat, and the
prospects are so favourable that the company are about commencing
operations here also.
At the junction of the Wialdra Creek with the Cudgegong is a
waterhole, into which the diggers on a lead in the vicinity were in
the habit of washing their tailings. This particular lead was and is
rich in diamonds, and I may mention that it is this ground which the
Australian Diamond Company are now engaged in working. The
Mudgee Company ?of which Mr. Hewitt, as I have stated, is manager
?have the right to one side of the river at this waterhole. This side
is owned by Mr. G. Rouse, from whom they hold the most of their
ground. The opposite side of the river is the property of Mr.
R. Rouse. Mr. Hewitt wished to drain this waterhole in order to
get out the tailings and any washing stuff at the bottom, but to do
this the consent of Mr. R. Rouse was necessary. In going up the
river to this place, the same features were presented as in the river
below. The geological formation was the same, and the banks, flats,
and hills were similar. The river flowed over its pebbled bed,
limpid, as if there was no such thing as gold-digging possible near
its waters. The course of the river was indicated at a distance by
the continuous row of straight and lofty dark-green river oaks, or
casuarince, which line the channel of all the streams of water in this
part of the country. The trees about the Cudgegong are mostly of
the Eucalyptus order, chiefly what are called box, bastard box, and
apple tree; I did not notice any iron-bark trees, which in Victoria are
so common on the goldfields. The valley of the river was open and
tolerably level, and there was no difficulty in driving a buggy along
it. The flats were evidently good pasture land, and the whole valley
was covered with a rich growth of grass, which, even at that season
of the year?the beginning of February?was green and flourishing.
It is evident that this district has been specially valuable as pastoral
country, and even its rich mineral resources have not yet found
greater favour in the eyes of its occupants than its pasturage. I
saw thousands of acres of dead forests, the trees of which had been
ringed years ago to prevent their interference with the growth
of the grass. Throughout this valley, miles of which have been
untouched by pick or shovel, there can be no doubt there are leads


of gold and diamonds, but there was no indication of digging
until we reached Wialdra, or Reedy Creek. This creek above its
junction with the river has a bed some forty or fifty yards wide
between high steep banks. The bed of the creek was dry, and con-
sisted apparently of nothing but a white coarse sand, of which there
was an immense quantity, the disintegrated material of some rocks
of a kind not perceptible to the mere passer-by. On the Cudgegong,
just above the junction of this creek with it, is the waterhole in
question, which is sixty or seventy yards in length, and nine or ten
wide, with a considerable depth of water in it. The bank next to
the Wialdra Creek was lined with heaps of tailings, and it was
evident that the bed of the waterhole contained hundreds of cart-
loads more. There could be no doubt that it would be a good
speculation to drain the hole and recover the tailings?that is, if the
operation was not too expensive. Mr. Hewitt was sanguine that it
could be done at a moderate cost, if the present dry season of the
year were taken advantage of, and that the enterprise would be very
remunerative. The arrival of the engine was opportune, for he could
convey it to the waterhole, and then have it got into working opera-
tion without any delay. The engine is one of Robey?s double
cylinder portable engines of ten-horse power. It was in good order,
and appeared to be a good handy article, just about what was wanted.
Mr. Hewitt was anxious to get to work at this undertaking without
delay, and after a visit to the works of the Australian Diamond Com-
pany we drove to Guntawang, the residence of Mr. Richard Rouse,
four or five miles higher up the river. As we proceeded in this
direction the valley of the river widened, the hills receded, and the
country became more level and clear of trees. I observed several
places where the extensive beds of white sand appeared to indicate
the former existence of soft sandstone rocks, which had been
disintegrated and degraded by the many influences at work.
Generally, however, the country presented a surface of rich alluvium,
and was evidently very fertile. At Guntawang we crossed the
shingly bed of the Cudgegong, and came to the residence, or home
station, of Mr. R. Rouse, a scattered and extensive cluster of build-
ings, very much in the old style, everything being built for use more
than for ornament. Mr. Rouse?s private residence was almost the
least conspicuous in the extensive establishment, but it is said that
he intends building a handsome and spacious mansion forthwith.
Mr. Hewitt was fortunate in meeting with Mr, Rouse, who had just
returned from Sydney. He is a young man, but in business older
than his years. He stated his terms briefly and decisively, and
would not vary from them. They appeared to me very moderate, and
although they involved the payment of ready money, were quite as
favourable as those indicated by the directors. Mr. Rouse mani-
fested great interest in the company?s enterprise, and was even en-
thusiastic about the richness of the district in precious stones. I


saw here a fine collection of minerals, made by a lady, the chief feature
of which were the extraordinary specimens of petrified There
were in the collection also specimens of opal, topaz, cairngorm,
chalcedony, hornstone, agate, and jasper, besides various ores and
many beautiful stones unknown to me, I may remark, as a fitting
conclusion to this account of our visit to Guntawang, that Mr.
Hewitt telegraphed to the directors in Melbourne Mr. Rouse?s terms,
and received a favourable reply. He has accordingly set vigorously
to work to have the waterhole drained out; and if this can be done
as easily as he thinks, he will have the tailings and the stuff from the
bottom of the hole up on the river bank, which is high above the
stream, before the rains set in at the end of autumn.
An illustration of the risks to which diamond companies are sub-
jected came under my notice, which may furnish a hint to managers
and directors. At Eeedy Creek we got a small boy to hold the
horse whilst we inspected the locality. When we returned I tossed
him a shilling for his trouble. Picking it up, he thanked me, and
then said, ? Please, master, is this a diamond V? showing me a small
unmistakeable octahedron about a grain in weight. I replied that it
was a diamond, and Mr. Hewitt corroborated me, when the lad dis-
played another nearly a carat in weight, but of a different shape,
which we also informed him was a diamond. He then wanted to
know what they were worth, and at length offered them for fifteen
shillings?much below their value. To my question where he got
them he replied that he had washed them out of some tailings with
a dish. He admitted, however, to Mr. Hewitt that he was employed
at the works of one of the diamond companies, so we declined to
purchase. It is possible his story may have been true, but there is
too much reason to suspect that there is a systematic pilfering of
diamonds at the works of the companies. It is well known that
diamonds can be purchased at the Cudgegong, which have come
from nobody knows where. Mr. Walsh, jeweller, of Melbourne,
has had diamonds offered to him for sale, about which there
is some mystery. One parcel was said to have been obtained
in South Australia, and various localities in Victoria get the credit
of having produced some of the gems offered for sale. _ The
strangest part of the matter is that those gems thus mysteriously
obtained are invariably of the finest description. The diamond com-
* I understand that about four weeks after my visit Mr. Hewitt had made
a dam above the waterhole, had formed a tailrace at the lower end. which had
lowered the water three or four feet, and was about to set the engine to
work to pump out the hole ; when the heavy rains which have been preva-
valent in the northern portion of South Wales set in and flooded the
river, of course putting an end to operations until the river subsides. I or-
tunatcly no injury was done to the dam or the works, timely information
having been received of the rise in the river many miles above. It is pro-
bable that the continued floods will prevent the working of the waterhole
until next summer.


parties must look sharply after their interests in this matter. In
Brazil, as all the writers about the diamond mines there tell us, even
when ?slaves were employed in diamond-washing under the closest
surveillance, and when military outposts guarded all the outlets of
the diamond districts, a large portion of* the best were
bought by smugglers and sold in Bio Janeiro. John Mawe, in his
book on Brazil, tells some interesting anecdotes about the smuggling
of diamonds; and he, as well as other travellers, refers to the strong
inclination that is felt, on seeing diamonds washed out, to secrete
and appropriate them. If this temptation has been experienced by
men in their position, we cannot expect that the men engaged in
diamond-washing can be wholly free from it. Tim Companies
will have to devise some means of checking the pilfering of gems,
and of protecting themselves against a source of loss, which is very
serious, because it is precisely those gems that are the most
valuable which are likely to be too much for the honesty of the
men employed.

THE CUDGEGONG DIAMOND DISTRICT.
THE AUSTRALIAN DIAMOND COMPANY.
p visit to the works of the Australian Diamond Mines
Company at the junction of the Wialdra or Reedy Creek with the
Cud� , e<mng. This Company appears to have concentrated its efforts
in one locality, and as its machinery has for some time been erected
and is in regular working order, a good idea is afforded of the
business of diamond-washing, and of its prospects as a paying spe-
culation. The works are situated on the upper bank of the creek,
where it possesses the characteristics I have already alluded to?a
wide channel covered with coarse quartz sand, and high banks. _ln
fact the stream has evidently cut through a deposit of alluvium
down to the sand-drift some twenty or thirty feet below, leaving
steep banks on each side. I have no idea where this ex-
tensive deposit of sand has come from, as I had no time to pro-
secute the search for the locality of the rocks which have furnished
it. It would be interesting to ascertain this, as I think there is
no doubt the presence of diamonds is connected with the ex-
istence of this drift. I saw Mr. Yicary, the manager, who very
civilly showed me over the works of the Company. There is
a steam engine of four-horse power employed in pumping and
workino- two of Hunt?s machines, which are used here in
connection with a long-tom. The washing stuff is thrown into


the tom, in which a stream of water flows, and it is stirred back and
forward with shovels so as to separate the clay from the sand and
gravel. The large stones are shovelled away, and the smaller,
together with the sand, gravel, &c., pass through the perforated iron
plate at the end into Hunt?s machine, which is wrought in the way
I have already described. A shoot carries off the tailings from the
machine. From what I saw? of the tailings, Ido not think the stuff
receives sufficient washing to free the stones from the adherent clay,
which here is white and very tenacious. The top of Hunt?s machine
is covered by a wire screen, to prevent any meddling hands interfering
with its contents. There is a trough lined with blanketing for the
purpose of catching the fine gold in the stuff. These works are all
well covered in, and they present a very busy and animated appear-
ance. The large heaps of refuse pebbles and tailings show that a
great deal of work has been done, and that the experiment of working
the ground for diamonds is being fairly tried. I believe that the
results are satisfactory, and that the Company?s operations are now
paying expenses and leaving a margin of profit. In a new undertak-
ing of this kind, in which so many unforeseen difficulties have to be
met, this is very satisfactory. The Company appear to have had
some difficulty in suiting themselves with a manager to their liking,
and this must always be a difficulty in enterprises which require
honest and efficient management, especially when so far removed
from the control of the directors. The Company has three of
Hunt?s machines and two pumps on the ground. When the wash-
ing stuff has been passed through Hunt?s machine, and only the
heavier portion remains, as I have stated, the gravel thus left
behind is spread out and examined. The Company have rather
rude appliances for this portion of the work. This process is
performed upon the inner portion of a sheet of bark. I saw a
quantity of stuff spread out in this way, and white topazes, rubies,
and zircons, picked out of it. Some of the topazes were nearly the
size of marbles, but the other gems were small. Occasionally
hyacinths and dark red zircons are found as large as peas. There is
an immense quantity of this gem sand found in the washing stuff.
The coarse sand is dark, but the fine sand is of a yellowish-grey
colour, and when examined with a magnifying glass it presents a
remarkably brilliant appearance, consisting as it does of minute
hyacinths, topazes, sapphires, and rubies. The sand is preserved by
the Companies, and I understand will command a market in London
at five shillings an ounce, to be ground up as corundum powder for
cutting precious stones. The small rubies are picked out by boys,
as they are valuable in watchmaking. Searching for diamonds is
very trying to the sight, and Captain Burton states that in Brazil
the sight among diamond-seekers is not relied upon after five-and-
twenty. Boys are the most successful gem-seekers. The surface of
a diamond in the natural state is sometimes dull, and then the stone


requires to be examined to determine its true character, but usually
there is no mistaking it. In some the surface shines like polished
silver, and in others the light is soft and pearly. As a rule the
diamond has a distinct crystallised form, and whichever way the
stone is turned the body of it is luminous, thus differing from pieces
of crystal quartz, whose brilliance at certain angles is hardly inferior
to that of the diamond.
The stuff which is now being washed for gold and diamonds is
obtained from the lead on the slope of the hill hard by. The Com-
pany possess here thirteen acres of ground. They bought out some
parties who held claims on the old lead to which I have before
alluded, and which proved a great source of attraction to a large
number of diggers for some time. It is curious that this lead, which
is a portion of the ancient channel of the creek, is also (like the most
of the leads at the Cudgegong) in the vicinity of what appears to be
an outcrop of basalt. The Company have put down a shaft here not
more than thirty or forty yards from the works, and from this shaft
they get their washdirt. The shaft is twenty-five feet deep to
the bed-rock, which is soft slate. The washdirt is exactly like that
from so many parts of Epsom and Huntly, in the Bendigo district?
white rounded quartz pebbles and boulders, with white clay and
sand. There is a great deal of what the miners call ? floating
reef? in the stuff?that is, a soft white sandstone or schist,
inclining to pipeclay, and this, no doubt, gives it the white
colour so prevalent. I turned over the pebbles and washdirt,
but saw nothing different from what may be observed in any
claim at Huntly. The stuff is, however, unquestionably rich in
diamonds, and also contains gold in considerable quantity. In
five weeks of the present year about 350 diamonds have been
obtained, besides 14 ozs. of gold. The gold-bearing stratum is
much richer than this return would indicate, but it should be
borne in mind that a greater thickness of the deposit is washed
for diamonds than would be washed for gold alone, and diamonds
are found higher up in the drift. At the time of my visit to the
Company?s mine and workings, upwards of a thousand diamonds had
been obtained; and I observe by the report of the half-yearly meeting
of the Company, held about a month since, that the total number
obtained up to that time was 1219, They have been generally very
brilliant, though mostly small, and have averaged in value nearly .�1
sterling each. Besides the ground held at Reedy Creek, the Com-
pany hold fifteen acres at Two-mile Flat, on Buckley?s Lead, as well
as two thousand yards of the river bed.
I have confined my remarks upon diamond-mining, or washing,
on the Cudgegong, chiefly to the operations of the two Companies,
but the reader must not suppose that they monopolise this pursuit.
There are other Companies working or in course of formation. There
are several parties of miners working the leads for diamonds, and the


old tailings are successfully washed by even women and boys. The
richest locality in diamonds is Hassall?s Hill, two or three miles below
Two-mile Flat. This hill is like the other rich localities, covered
with masses of basalt. The lead is a portion of the old river bed,
somewhat similar to that at Jordan?s Hill, already referred to, and
containing hard ironstone cement. The richness of this lead in
diamonds may be inferred from the fact that in one claim more than
300 diamonds were Washed from thirty-three loads of stuff, and in
another twelve loads yielded 110 diamonds. There are several other
localities on the Cudgegong, such as the Rocky Ridge and the Horse-
shoe Bend, where diamonds have also been found, and where parties
are now engaged in washing for them, but it is unnecessary to par-
ticularise them. It is tolerably certain that the old river bed
for some nine or ten miles of its course contains diamonds as
well as gold, and where it has been washed away these have
been swept into the present bed of the Cudgegong. I believe
that eventually this will furnish what Captain Burton would call
the ? richest diamantation.? As to the prospects of the diamond-
mining companies, the reader is now about in as good a position
to judge as I am. All such speculations are of course doubtful,
because success requires so many conditions to ensure it. That
the locality is rich enough in diamonds and gold to pay hand-
some returns to those who can find out the way to work the drift
economically, is, I think, beyond a doubt. The industry is new,
however, and the pioneers of such enterprises very often only spend
money in experimenting for the benefit, of those who come after
them. Still in a mining country like Australia there should be the
knowledge, the skill, and the appliances requisite for washing the
gold and diamond deposits of the Cudgegong with profit to those
who enter upon the undertaking. With honest and intelligent
managers the companies will in due time reap the reward of their
enterprise, but shareholders must be patient, and not expect that
even in a diamond mine are brilliant returns to be obtained all at
once. They should nut worry their managers, who have quite
enough to contend with on the ground. When shareholders expect
a manager to go on obtaining large weekly returns of diamonds,
before he has proper machinery to work the ground, they show their
utter unreasonableness. Considering the operations that have been
carried on at the Cudgegong by men new to the industry, and with
imperfect appliances, it appears to me at once surprising, and a proof
of the richness of the place, that such excellent results have been
obtained.


No. XII.
THE CUDGEGONG DIAMOND DISTRICT.
GEOLOGICAL NOTES ?THE DIAMOND FORMATION.
Some observations upon.the geological character of the country, and
the conditions under which diamonds are found, as compared with
diamond districts in other portions of the world, will form a fitting
conclusion to this notice of the Cudgegong district. lam to some
extent assisted in this portion of my remarks by an excellent report
drawn up by Professor Thomson, of Sydney, which came into my
hands since these letters were commenced, and a portion of which I
shall append to my observations. I referred in one of my letters to
the fact that I had reason to believe the proprietors of the Sydney
Morning Herald intended to obtain information respecting the Cudge-
gong Diamond District for the enlightenment of the New South Wales
people on the subject of one of their most interesting mineral pro-
ductions. I observe with pleasure that this intention has been carried
out, and that in the Herald of the 4th March there is a very inte-
resting communication from Mr. Norman Taylor respecting the geo-
logical formation of the Cudgegong Diamond District. Mr. Taylor?s
qualifications for the task, as a former member of Mr. Selwyn?s geo-
logical staff in Victoria, are undoubted; but on some points I shall
take the liberty of differing from him in the conclusions he arrives at.
The geological formation of this district is to all appearance
Upper Silurian. All known gold deposits are found in what is
called the Silurian rocks, a geological term which is of course per-
fectly intelligible to the ordinary reader. The Bendigo district be-
longs to the Lower Silurian age, but there is reason to believe that
the Upper Silurian rocks are to be found to the north-east of this
district. The peculiarities of the Cudgegong, as compared with or-
dinary Victorian goldfields, are the hardness of the rocks and the
abruptness of the hills. The auriferous schists and sandstones are
chiefly metamorphic ?that is, altered by heat and other agencies
into hard brittle or crystalline rocks. Quartz veins are not numerous
nor are they thick, and there are very few outcrops of quartz such as
gave rise here to the term ?reef.? There is evidence, however, in
the detritus of the ancient river bed that at a former period of the
earth?s history quartz and the softer sandstones and schists of the
gold formation were more plentiful than they are now. It would
seem indeed that this detritus is the remains of a series of rocks that
have to a great extent disappeared. The character of the existing
rocks, the presence of diorite or greenstone in large dykes and
masses, and the proximity of the carboniferous shales and sandstones,
have led to the conclusion that the formation is Upper Silurian ;
but Mr. Taylor states that he could find no trace of fossils to assist


him in coming to a conclusion. A good idea of the Cudgegong
diamond district can be formed thus: Take a goldfield with loftier
and steeper hills than Bendigo, the ordinary rocks being for the
most part flinty or crystalline, and intruded by large dykes of green-
stone (diorite); introduce a river like the Campaspe at Axedale
through it, with the slopes of the ridges leading from the mountains
to the green banks of the river showing here and there outcrops of
basalt; and you have a rough approximation to the Cudgegong. I
mentioned that on the ranges seven or eight miles from Two-mile
Flat ?the township at which place seems to have been christened
Warburton ?I saw boulders of what appeared at a cursory glance to
be granite. Mr. Taylor in his paper mentions soft and hard sandstone
rocks of a red and yellow colour, but without mica, and also a coarse
gritty sandstone rock.
I will not weary the reader with any geological details, into which
indeed I venture with fear and .trembling, and a due sense of my
own want of technical knowledge. I believe the drift, in what I
term the ancient river channel, in which the diamonds are found, is
technically said to belong to the ? Older Pliocene Period,? one of the
stages of the Tertiary formation, but for our purpose the phrase I
use will be sufficiently intelligible. The great question of interest is
this ?Whence came these diamonds'? What is their matrix ? Were
they formed in this drift after its deposit, as Mr. Taylor, and I believe
Professor Thomson, are inclined to think ? or were they simply a
portion of the disintegrated rocks which supplied the drift 1 Mr.
Taylor supports his opinion by pointing out that the diamonds found
in the ancient drift are almost without exception perfectly formed,
with the fine points and edges of the crystallisation unabraded;
whereas those diamonds that have been washed from the tailings
in the river show marks of the ill usage they have met with
among the pebbles and boulders. The inference plainly is,
that had the diamonds been deposited in the detritus of rocks
along with the pebbles, sand, and boulders of the ancient river
bed, they would have been flawed and fractured in the same way
as those in the river. Professor Thomson suggests the same view,
but is not certain that the carboniferous rocks in the neighbourhood
have not had something to do with the formations of the diamonds.
Now, I am by no means certain that the premises of Mr. Taylor are
beyond dispute. Ido not know that it is yet an undoubted fact
that all the diamonds got in the ancient river bed show no signs of
having been rolled about with the shingle and gravel by the floods.
Then the diamonds as yet found in the bed of the present river are
only those which have been washed away in the tailings, and that
simple operation can hardly be supposed to have done any injury to
them, any more than is done to those which are obtained direct from
the drift. I simply state a fact which appears to be at variance with
the premises, but I admit that there are many arguments in favour


�f Mr. Taylor?s hypothesis. The sapphire is very nearly as hard as
the diamond, yet in the same deposits in which the diamonds are
found perfectly free from flaw, the sapphires are in fractured pieces,
and I do not believe that a perfectly crystallised sapphire has yet
been found on the river. As to the diamonds having been derived
from the carboniferous rocks in the neighbourhood, the theory is
utterly untenable. The ancient river drift in which the gems are
found is almost destitute of any detritus from the carboniferous
rocks, whilst the present river drift has it in abundance. Then if
the diamond is derived from the carboniferous rocks, how is it that
no diamonds have been found in their immediate vicinity ?
If this ancient drift is the matrix, then there is no use looking
among the rocks for it, and whether ? Itacolumite? is or is not pre-
sent is immaterial. But the matter is not so easily disposed of. In
Brazil a pudding-stone or breccia conglomerate, which is simply the
ancient drift and pebbles of river beds cemented into a rock by oxide
of iron, manganese, lime, or some other mineral agent, is looked upon
as a diamond matrix. But the diamond is also found in clay, in ground
where there is no conglomerate, and it has been found embedded in the
?Itacolumite rock,? which in Brazil extends over a great area of
country. The reader may be interested in what is said on this sub-
ject by travellers.
John Mawe, in his Travels in Brazil , says? ? I had some conver-
sation with the officers respecting the matrix of the diamonds, not a
vestige of which could I trace. They informed me that they often
found diamonds cemented in pudding-stone, accompanied with grains
of gold.? Again he says?? On many parts by the edge of the river
are large conglomerate masses of rounded pebbles cemented by oxide
of iron, which sometimes envelope gold and diamonds.?
Captain Burton, in his book, Highlands of the Brazil, volume 2,
page 116, says in a footnote in allusion to the ? Cascalho? or washing
stuff?? Generally called ? Cascalho corrida? (w T ater washed), opposed
to ?Cascalho virgem,? the pudding-stone.? Again, in another note
in reference to ?Canga,? he says?? The Canga of Diamantina
is a conglomerate of quartz, mica, and other components pasted
together with red-yellow iron clay, and covered with the dark ferru-
ginous shining metallic coat which gives it a name. It is essentially
diamantiferous as well as auriferous. M. Sipolis showed me a pure
stone embedded in it, of course the result of water-washing.? At
page 201 he says??At noon w T e passed on the left bank, ridges caked
over with hard ?Canga;? water trickled from it upon the loose
Cascalho and the felspathic clay. This is a true diamantine forma-
tion.? Many other passages in Captain Burton?s book are to the
same effect. At pages 138-9, however, he says distinctly that about
?Diamantina? the matrix of the diamond is ?Itacolumite.? The
whole passage is worth quoting ;
?As regard the matrix of the diamond, many popular errors are
d 2


still afloat. It lias been washed mostly in the ? Cascalho ? gravel,
brought down by streams, and deposited either on the banks or in
the beds. Hence books have determined that tbe diamond is found
embedded in gravel and transported minerals whose history cannot
be traced. Others are of opinion that the diamond was formed in
the alluvial and arenaceous matter that accompany the Tertiary and
Quaternary epochs.? w ? Many authors have mistaken the
secondary for the primary formation of the diamond. The gangue
about Diamantina at least is the white and red granular and quartz-
ose Itacolumite, which has been weathered and worn down by
geological commotions. [ln a note here he says ?? In the crystalline
Itacolumite I have not seen the diamond, but I can hardly doubt
that it exists there.?] This was suspected by Dr. Gardner, who ob-
served that the matrix of the stone is not the diluvial gravelly soil,
but the metamorphic quartzo-schist rock. The general idea is that
the hard sandstone ? pissarra? or psammitic grit bears diamonds
when old, but not when new. The fact is easily proved. All the
diggings which are not near or in rivers lie at the base of some
stony In ass ; diamonds have been found in the Itacolumite by
several hands; and, finally, I have sent to England a specimen im-
bedded in Itacolumite. Perhaps the day will come when this rock
will be spalled, stamped, and washed for diamond dust as if for gold.
According to miners in this part of Brazil, the diamantation (to
borrow the native term) is found in the gurgulho, breccia, or loose
puddling of angular stones. Wonderful tales are told of its wealth,
&c.?
In the Indian diamond mines there does not appear to be any
such rock as Itacolumite recognised as the matrix. In some
districts the diamond is found in the clay, in others in the drift of
rivers, and in others in beds of conglomerate cement, at various
depths below the surface. I may have occasion to refer to these
mines more particularly, to the conditions attending the deposit, and
to the mode of working for diamonds. The quotations I have
made show very clearly not only that authorities differ as to what
is really the matrix of the diamond, but that an eminent authority,
Captain Burton, speaks confidently of two different formations as
each being the true matrix, the one the conglomerate pudding-stone,
and the other the Itacolumite rock. In each of these formations he
saw an embedded diamond. How is this to be reconciled? Are
there two distinct matrices, or are the diamonds in the pudding-
stone a portion of the detritus of diamond-bearing Itacolumite 1 Our
Australian authorities referred to should reconcile their theory to
the known facts. If they are right as regards Cudgegong, and the
gems are formed in the drift, then there are two distinct sources
from which the diamond is obtained. If it is formed in this ancient
river drift, however, why is it not distributed throughout it, and
why is it found in the greatest quantities just where its specific


gravity should lead us to expect to find it. When the Cudgegong
district has been thoroughly examined by practical men, we may
expect some light to be thrown upon a question which is at present
obscure. I myself believe that there are evidences of the existence
at the Cudgegong of an analogous rock to the Brazilian Itacolumite.
No. XIII.
THE CUDGEGONG DIAMOND DISTRICT.
THE DIAMOND FORMATION. ?ITACOLUMITE.
From what I have said concerning the general appearance and the
geological formation of the Cudgegong diamond district, the reader
will rightly infer that it differs from the chief diamond districts in
Brazil, if not in India. The local authorities, to whom I have alluded,
assume that the Cudgegong resembles some of the Indian districts,
but I have not met such a detailed description of the latter as
would enable me to speak with any certainty on the point. In
Jamieson?s Mineralogy , which, though old, is a good authority, it is
stated that in some districts in India diamonds are obtained under
beds of red and blue clay. In Cuddapah, river drift and gravel are
washed for the gem. At Banaganpilly, shafts are sunk through a
conglomerate rock, which at a certain depth changes into a ferrugi-
nous sandstone. The sinking is about twenty feet in depth, and
requires steel gads and wedges. The diamond bed is a conglomerate
or cement about a foot thick, composed of rounded pebbles of quartz,
chalcedony, jasper, &c., and tunnels are driven to work it. The
rocks in the vicinity of these diamond mines are said to be chiefly
mica slate and quartz, but the information on this point is very
scanty.
We have the fullest information, however, respecting the districts
in which diamonds are found in Brazil, especially Diarnantina to the
north of Minas Geraes, which was visited by Mawe forty years ago,
and by Captain Burton a year or two since. I shall quote a few ex-
tracts from the work of the latter, for the purpose of conveying to the
reader an idea of what the ? Itacolumite ? rock is, and of the country
in which it abounds. One feature of the Itacolumite district is the
sandy, sterile appearance of some places with rich soils in the vicinity.
At page 216 of his book the traveller Mawe notices the great change
in the country which took place when he entered the Diamond
district. He describes the sterile appearance of the country, its sur-
face consisting of coarse sand and rounded quartz pebbles, and almost
destitute of Wood or herbage. On his noticing the peculiarities


of the locality, a soldier accompanying him remarked, ?Senhor, we
are in the diamond district.? Captain Burton was struck with the
same appearance. At page 80-1, vol. 2, he says?? We now enter
the true diamantine land. * * * It is a complete change of
scenery; everything is the image of bouleversement and aridity.?
He goes on to allude to the sandstone rocks, the patches of snow-
white sand visible, and the scanty and poor vegetation ; and, recog-
nising a formation he had seen in other places, concludes that the
area of the diamantine formation is more extensive than is commonly
supposed. Throughout the diamond district he is struck by the
extensive deposits of sand, coarse and fine, which he attributes to
the wearing of the Itacolumite rock. At page 326 he says?? Sheets
and heaps of the whitest sand, the degradation of itacolumite,
glittered in the sun like the patches that lie about Diamantina.?
The reader will by this time be interested in knowing what
? itacolumite ? is. Captain Burton, in his book, has numerous
references to it, and takes some trouble to describe the various
rocks that are comprised under this term. There is a variety of
the rock known as ?flexible stone,? which is commonly considered
the diamantine rock. This flexibility appears to be caused by the
quantity of mica in the laminations of the stone. As will be seen
by the following extract, Captain Burton does not consider that
this variety is the matrix of the diamond. At page 379 of his first
volume of the Highlands of Brazil , he says?? This flexible stone
(flexible itacolumite) is not the matrix of the diamond and the
topaz, though sometimes associated with it. Diamantine � ita-
columite ? is, as will presently appear, a hard talcose rock of dis-
tinctly laminated quartz, white, red, or yellow, granular, with finely-
disseminated points of mica; it is either stratified or unstratified.
In Minas the name is popularly given to the refractory sandstone
grits, and to a fine crystalline rock, evidently affected by intense
heat.? At page 69, vol. 2, he describes a rock ?unelastic sand-
stone, slaty, talcose, and laminated ?in fact, diamantine itacolu-
mite.? Again, at page 110, ?Around us were outcrops of the
usual granular quartzose itacolumite, hard and soft, finely lami-
nated or coarsely agglutinated, greyish outside, the inside snow
coloured or slightly yellow. * * * The degration of this
grit forms the frequent patches of snowy sand.? The varieties are
many. At page 121, he speaks of ? blocks of the hardest crys-
talline itacolumite showing a distinct cleavage; one kind is the
green (cabo verde), whilst the other has a ruddy purplish blush,
the effect of iron. Both glitter and sparkle with mica.? At page
306, there is a reference to ?laminated quartzose sandstone ?in fact,
true itacolumite. Mostly it was reddish, like a half-burnt brick,
exceedingly compact, and streaked and dotted with finely dissemi-
nated points of mica; other specimens were purely white, with a
coarse texture.? At page 313, he speaks of the dip of this rock as


? nearly vertical,? and states that in one place the ? itacolumite
was striped with broad bands of quartz, and the junction may be
the birthplace of the diamond.?
The reader who is interested in the subject may consxdt Captain
Burton?s book, which is the most recent notice of the Brazil
diamond district. He will find numerous references to this rock
besides those I have quoted, and will observe that it varies from
a very-fine-grained rock to a very coarse grit, yielding easily to
the disintegrating action of the weather. I believe that the exten-
sive accumulations of fine and coarse sand, not much waterworn
in the ancient river drift in the bed of the Wialdra Creek, and at
various places in the present river bed of the Cudgegong, are the
detritus of itacolumite rocks. Mr. Taylor was of opinion that this
coarse and angular sand drift was from granitic rocks, but the
other constituents of granite were absent. I have no doubt that
careful examination will reveal the sources of this drift, and will
show that the analagous rock to the Brazilian itacolumite now
exists at the Cudgegong. lam able to furnish a curious corrobo-
ration of this opinion. The Meroo mountains bound the Cudgegono-
valley on the south west. Seventeen years ago, I visited the gold-
fields of the Turon, Meroo, &c., as special correspondent of the
Sydney Empire, and in my letter about the Meroo I find the
following remarks:?? The rocks on the Meroo are chiefly
quartzose schists and quartz. Clay slate abounds, and a descrip-
tion of rock resembling granite, of a coarse granular texture, but
having a laminated structure. This rock lies on the ridges in
immense masses.? There can be no doubt that this rock, which
answers to the description of the coarse itacolumite, accounts for
the coarse sand drift in the Cudgegong as well as in the Meroo,
where, as appears in the same letter, I was struck with the ?exten-
sive deposit of sandy debris.? Even then precious stones had been
noticed here, for in the same letter it is mentioned that ?Dr.
Foulis states that topazes, emeralds, and garnets have been found
in the cradle on this riverand again, ? Mr. Stutchbury, the
Government surveyor, has reported that precious stones exist in
the Cudgegong or Mudgee Biver ? It does seem strange that with
this knowledge of the richness of the district in precious stones, the
people of the district have allowed seventeen years to elapse before
attempting to turn this richness to any account; and even now the
diamond mining industry at the Cudgegong owes its existence to
the skill and intelligence of a Victorian jeweller?Mr. Crisp?and
to the enterprise of Victorian capitalists. It is perhaps not gene-
rally known that the systematic efforts made by the latter to
develop the mineral wealth of the Cudgegong were prompted by
Mr. Crisp, who observed a rough diamond in a ring brought to
him for repair by a bushman, and ascertained that the gem was
found near Mudgee. Diamonds have been found in Victoria in


more tlinn one locality, but not in sufficient quantity to make tlie
searcli for them profitable. Who can say, however, that important
discoveries of gems may not be made such as will cause the seaich
for them to develop into an important branch of industry. Some
months ago a paragraph appeared in the Bendigo Advertise') to the
effect that two diamonds had been found at Epsom, obtained from
the stamper boxes after a crushing of cement. The writei of this,
in his visit to Cudgegong, had partly in view the obtaining of such
information respecting the diamond district there as might be
turned to good account in forming an opinion respecting the pro-
bability of the diamond formation existing near Bendigo. Whether
the information he obtained, and which the reader now has befoie
him, can be turned to any account in this way remains to be seen.
It would be well if miners, especially at Epsom and Huffily, would
preserve any stones which, from their colour, peculiai foim, 01
brilliancy, differ from the ordinary contents of the auriferous wash-
dirt. From the fact that diamonds have been found in the north-
east of the Bendigo mining district, and from the change that takes
place in the geological formation in this portion of the goldfields, it
is not all improbable that some discovery of importance will be
made here. This is a subject, however, which will be treated
more fully and more properly in the ordinary columns of the paper.
I may say, in conclusion, that I was well repaid for my trouble in
visiting the Cudgegong by the interesting character of the country,
that my inquiries for information were most courteously met on all
hands, and I only regret that my arrangements did not allow me
to make a longer stay, and more fully and carefully examine
the country.
Ho. XIY.
THE CUDGEGONG DIAMOND DISTRICT.
Professor Thomson?s Report.
I subjoin a report made by Professor Thomson, of Sydney, con-
cerning the diamond district of Cudgegong, omitting the references
made to the ground and the probable prospects of a diamond
company in course of formation, as these are private matters.
The geological description of the locality is very interesting, as it
is made by a gentleman whoso scientific attainments entitle his
opinions to weight. The report is dated in January last, and it
did not come into my hands until several of my letters about
Cudgegong had been published.


? In the first place, it may be as well to state that the occurrence
of genuine and veritable diamonds in this part is a fact beyond all
question. Some statistics lately drawn up here show that over
2500 diamonds have been collected since attention was first
directed to the subject, about seven mpnths ago. I should estimate
the number of diamonds at present in the possession of diggers and
of the companies to be about a thousand, as I happen to have seen
600, and have heard of many more. The diamonds hitherto found
here are gems of the most unmistakable character, possessing a
brilliant adamantine lustre peculiar to themselves, and a well-
defined crystalline form. They are mostly pellucid and colourless,
though many may have a straw yellow tint; and afew brown, green,
and black diamonds have been met with here. The commonest
forms of crystal in the diamonds of this locality are the octahedron,
trisoctahedron, the modified tetrahedron, with curved faces, the
rhombic dodecahedron, and a peculiar triangular twin crystal.
Dark spots within the crystal are very common. The majority of
the diamonds are small and perfect crystals. It mostly happens that
fractured and damaged stones are those which have been found
in the gravel or ? tailings? from former gold-washing operations,
deposited in the waterhofes of the river. The stones obtained by
direct treatment of previously undisturbed drift are rarely found
to be damaged, though they usually occur in coarse gravels full of
heavy boulders apparently capable of fracturing the diamond,
which, though inferior to no substance in hardness, is a brittle
mineral, and capable of being split in particular directions. The
largest diamond hitherto discovered in this locality was a colour-
less octahedron, weighing 5| carats. I should Judge, however,
that at least ninety per cent, of the stones here weigh considerably
less than a carat. The following results were obtained in the cases
of three distinct parcels: ?306 diamonds weighed carats
(largest 1 3-5 carat); 81 diamonds weighed 19 carats (largest
about 1� carat); 110 diamonds weighed 26� carats. This shows
an average weight of one carat grain each. The small average size
of the stones here, and the extreme rarity of large gems in other
parts of the world where the diamond occurs, deserve to be borne
in mind while estimating the prospects of a systematic course of
mining for them. The expectations so freely expressed hereabouts,
that where there are small diamonds there must be large ones, are
apt to lead persons to suppose that gems of the highest value are
sure to be discovered. But the supposition loses much of its force
on comparing the rich diamond mines of Brazil with those of
India, and taking into account that all the most celebrated
diamonds in the world have been found in India. On the other
hand, further observations in this locality will, I believe, show that
the occurrence of the diamond here is more like that observed in
India than in Brazil.


? One of the accompanying plans will show the localities which,
as far as I am aware, are the only ones where diamonds have as
yet been found on the Cudgegong River:?l, Junction of Reedy
or Wialdra Creek with the Cudgegong River; 2, Jordan?s Hill;
3, Two Mile Flat; 4, Rocky Ridge; 5, Horseshoe Bend; 6,
Hassall?s Hill. It is not likely that they are limited to this
small area, but their existence either higher up the river than
Wialdra Creek, or lower down than Hassall?s Hill, has not yet
been proved.
? The diamonds occur in an old drift near the river. The drift
marks the former course of the river, and lies at an elevation of
about forty feet above it. There is clear local evidence that the
course of the river has been much altered since this old drift
formed a portion of the channel. The river now takes different
bends. At Two-mile Flat a circuitous loop has evidently been cut
off by the river forcing its way through a narrow neck of land.
All the old drift of the ancient river-bed would probably have been
long since swept away, had it not been for a somewhat remarkable
geological event?that a flow of basalt (or lava) found its way down
the old river valley, forming a thick covering over the gravel and
shingle accumulated there. The point of eruption where this
igneous flow emanated is nowhere traceable in the vicinity : as it
can be followed at intervals for seventeen miles, it probably came
from a great distance. It may have happened during the miocene
or a later tertiary geological age. The geology of this part of the
country has been investigated by Mr. Norman Taylor, of the late
Geological Survey of Victoria. But although this basalt was once
a continuous shegt of volcanic rock, it now consists merely of a
few isolated and distant points. The few remnants which have
escaped the wasting action of water are indicated on the plan.
The drift, which has been preserved beneath these areas of basalt,
drew the attention of the gold miner, and became explored for
gold during the ? rush ?to Two-mile Flat in June, 1867, Nu-
merous shafts have been sunk through the basalt, which is some-
times seventy-five feet thick, extremely hard, and either massive or
columnar. In each area the drift deposit is found underneath. It
is in this drift that the diamonds are now found. As the method
of gold washing was little adapted for detecting the presence of
diamonds, it is not remarkable that they were at first overlooked;
still there is good evidence that they were noticed by the diggers
here two years ago. At present the drift is being extracted from
beneath the basalt, and washed for diamonds with variable success.
On Hassall?s Hill, in one claim, 306 diamonds (74|- carats) were
obtained from thirty-three loads of drift; in another, 110 diamonds
(26|- carats) from twelve loads; in other localities perhaps one
diamond in each load would not be an unfair average. Some per-
sons are engaged in recovering ? tailings ? from the waterholes,


and washing out diamonds by various contrivances. It was in
this way that the largest stone hitherto discovered (5| carats) was
obtained.
? The old drift, in which diamonds are found, is composed of loose
quartz gravel and boulders. Layers and veins in it have been con-
nected together by oxide of iron, or manganese, and in some places
by a siliceous material coloured green by iron. The quartz pebbles
are most frequently white : they are often coated superficially with
a brown or pinkish red film of iron oxide, or with black specks
and dendritic markings due to manganese. Some of the boulders
are coated with a bright siliceous polish. Silicified wood, which
has been derived from the carboniferous rocks, is common in the
drift. It also contains a few boulders of schistose and felspathic
rocks, which are now decomposed into clay, and occasionally
boulders of slate and quartzites, Jasper, agate, cornelian, smoky
quartz, and a variety of quartz which has an opalescent lustre
when wet, and double six-sided pyramids of quartz more or less
water worn, occur in abundance. The heavier minerals, which
accumulate in the washing, consist of pleonaste in great quantity,
red spinel (Balas ruby), sapphire, topaz (chiefly white, only a few
yellow ones having been found), zircon, tourmaline (black), chry-
solite (?), beryl (1), titanic iron, gold, and small fragments of metal-
lic iron, probably from the workmen?s tools. With the exception
of the topaz, these heavier minerals, which generally go by the
name of ?gem sand,? are remarkably small, not exceeding an
eighth of an inch in diameter. They probably do not possess a
higher value than common corundum. The gem sand is black
from the predominance of the pleonaste, several pounds weight of
which can be collected from each load of drift. The gold in the
drift varies from three to four and a half pennyweights per load.
? The old drift reposes upon the ? bed rock,? which consists in
this district of alternations of vertical slates and metamorphic
sandstones, much intruded by diorite. The thickness of the drift
varies from three to twenty feet. It is not yet ascertained in what
parts of the drift diamonds occur in greatest abundance, but
preference is given to the lower portion. It is nearly certain, how-
ever, that diamonds exist all through the drift, but are not so
abundant in the upper portion. The matrix, or bed rock, of the
diamond in this country has not been detected. Were this the
case, as in Brazil, it would certainly favour the prospects of dia-
mond mining. As the diamond-bearing drift contains much sili-
cified wood which comes from the carboniferous rocks, it is not im-
possible that the matrix of the diamond belongs to the same series.
If the matrix consists of the metamorphic schists and sandstone
which are common in the neighbourhood, it is strange that the old
drift contains fewer fragments of these rocks than the present river
bed. The matrix may still exist undiscovered in some locality, or


it may have been entirely destroyed by denudation. It will readily
be inferred that the old drift beneath the basalt is of great antiquity.
The old drift is also quite dissimilar to the present accumulations
of gravel and shingle in the river bed; and the facts appear to
favour the conclusion that the old drift was derived from the denu-
dation of a different series of rocks from those existing in the
present drainage area.
? The plan which is here adopted in searching for diamonds is,
first to screen the drift as it comes from the shaft, then to rid it of
clay as much as possible in a ? tom,? allowing the gold and
smaller material to pass through an iron grating, though a con-
siderable portion of the latter adheres to the coarse material, par-
ticularly if there is much clay present, and as this is rejected it is
possible that many diamonds are thus lost. In one case a heap of
coarse material, on being submitted to a second treatment, was
found to contain several diamonds. Any very large diamond
which happened to be covered with a superficial dull coating, or
which differed much in appearance from. the ordinary small bril-
liant gems, might be overlooked in this operation. By careful
removal of the clay, to prevent the adhesion of the smaller stones
to the larger, and by thoroughly washing the grating of the ?tom,?
loss of ordinary-sized stones might be avoided. All the gold is
separated in the ? tomthe finer material which has passed
through is next washed by Hunt?s ore-separating machine, or
a similar contrivance. After continuing the washing for sometime,
the heavier stones accumulate in the machine, while the speci-
fically lighter materials are washed away; in the heavier portion,
thus reduced to small bulk, the diamonds can be easily distin-
guished.? * *
In describing a locality below Two Mile Flat, where diamonds
have been found, where there is no basalt, and where the
drift is quite different from that in the other localities worked
for diamonds, he says:??lt is about twenty-five feet above the
river level, and is evidently of a younger age than the drift
beneath the basalt, from the fact of its lower level, its
containing pebbles of basalt derived from the waste of the
protective covering of the older drift, and the presence in
it of boulders of a conglomerate derived apparently from
the carboniferous rocks, which are also found in the present
liver bed, but cannot be detected in the more ancient drifts.
The diamonds in this drift may have been Avashed out of the
older deposit, as the unusual accumulation of gem sand in this
spot renders probable. This drift is covered Avith about tAvelve
feet of alluvial soil and gravel. It has a most peculiar character,
consisting of pure Avhite clay full of amygdaloidal cavities contain-
ing a broAvn or blue pulverulent matter, which appears to be de-
composed. basalt. The white clay is studded throughout Avith abund-


ance of small black grains of pleonast, and more sparingly with
blue grains of sapphire and red grains of spinel ruby
? As regards the river bed, I am not aware whether any tailn
from former gold workings have been deposited there or are likely
to have been subsequently washed thither But no attempts have
vet been made to test the undisturbed present riverbed for
diamonds. In all cases where diamonds have been mund t ,
rivers, they have come from the tailings originally derived from the
� 1( ? TheWialdra Creek watercourse is a bare, dry, level sandbank,
about fifty yards wide, confined within low banks m the midst ot
an alluvial plain. Basalt appears at the surface near the junction
thTriveJ, and overlies drift which is now being worked by
the Australian Diamond Company. This basalt spreads fo
considerable distance in the direction of Guntawong, but is co
cealed beneath a covering of drift; thus the basalt in this a.ea has
drift both above and below it. The next basalt which appeals on
Wialdra Creek extends along both sides below the junction of
Slapdash Creek. It is not known whether the old diift ex .
beneath this basalt. On the Slapdash Creek there are horizontal
beds of coarse grit, which are probably of tertiary age. Diamonds
have not yet been found in Wialdra Creek or in any drfWhrih
mi be sail to belong to it. There would be great difficult} in
testing the sand of Wialdra Creek from the �
everywhere abundant at the depth of a few feet _
would also interfere with the working of any drift winch may
exist beneath the basalt upon this creek.?

APPENDIX
REMARKS
ON A THICK SEAM OP COAL CROSSING THE LINE OF RAILWAY IN LITHGOW
VALLEY, BELOW THE MOUNT CLARENCE ZIG ZAG,
1. This seam, which has been known to me for many years and on which
1 reported in February, 1863, belongs to the lower portion of the western
section of the upper measures of the great coal field of New South Wales,
of the existence of which, so far from the coast, I first became personally
acquainted on 24th February, 1841, exactly, to a day, 29 years ago.
The position I thus assigned to this seam is determined on the evidence
offered by the presence of fossil plants and by the absence of marine fossils
in the beds associated with it, as well as by the geological conditions of the
accompanying strata.
Its elevation more than 3000 feet above the sea, and its slight inclination,
in no way interfere with this determination.
2. The character of the coal itself appears to be intermediate between
those of the lower Newcastle beds and of the variable seams of Branxton
and Anvil Creek. The specific gravity of the latter, in specimens similar to
that of Lithgow Valley, is 1*303, whereas the specific gravity of patches of
the seam from Sheedy?s farm at the outcrop came out 1-366, both experi-
ments having been made at temperatures corrected to 62� F.
It is therefore denser than the Anvil Creek coal; it also contains less
sulphur; it is in part a non-caking freely burning coal, approaching to
splint, giving out considerable heat, and yielding a grey and white ash, with
dark red flame.
It is jointed by thin fissures, which produce a polygonal, almost prismatic,
structure, coming away in large, clean, solid blocks without much slack, and
therefore favourable for transport.
3. The seam has now been proved in four places along an outcrop of
more than two miles in length; and there, as well as in other spots where shafts
have been sunk, its thickness has been ascertained to be from 9 to 11 feet,
under a considerable area. The roof is solid, formed of a gritty sandstone
or conglomerate which dips with the general incline of the beds gently to
the north-east, offering facilities for coal-getting and drainage. There are
in the upper part of the seam a few thin partings which toward the south-
ward are charged with the usual impressions of glossopteris, vertebraria,
&c. These indicate the probability of coal over a wide extent in the ranges
of this mountainous country. Shale beds, with spiriffers and other
marine shells, underlie the base of the coal about 2\ miles north-westwardly.
The seam of course, as is frequently the case, changes its character where
the covering is thin or denuded, as well as its thickness ; but, regarding it
as developed not far from the railway, it is a magnificent coal, which
promises to be equally as good on Sheedy?s farm as it is in the adit now


HE
opened for 80 yards at Esk Bank, tke neighbouring estate of Mr. Thomas
Brown.
4. The proximity of the railway station at Bowenfels, the facilities tor
working to advantage, and the indications of other valuable seams in the
vicinity, invite attention to the locality, and offer recommendation to
attempts now being made to open the western part of the coal field to the
advantage of the colony. And when it is recollected that, a few miles only
to the north-west, there exist still higher seams charged with petroleum,
the enterprise of working the Lithgow Valley seam will probably lead to
undertakings of similar kind in other portions of the wide-spread coal
deposits of the western districts.
