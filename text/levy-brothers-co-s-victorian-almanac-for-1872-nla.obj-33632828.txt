eminent Physicians and Surgeons ; and during the last thirty-five
years have proved their value in thousands of instances in diseases of

P. & Son respectfully invite the Public to an inspection of their

their
PATENT GAS BATH BOILER.
P. & Son’s Gas Bath Boiler will heat a 5 ft. Bath, when properly
filled, in the short space of half an hour, and at a cost of something
under 2d. for Gas. When the water is raised to the required tempera-
ture, the burner may be turned nearly out, as a very small light only
is necessary to keep Up the temperature while in use.
The Boiler is fitted at top with a dry chamber for the purpose of
warming Linen, and is provided with a Patent Swing Burner to turn
outwards for lighting, so as to avoid the explosions so consequently
attendant on the lighting of large burners in confined places. The
Boiler is attached to the Bath with screw connections, and may be
removed at any time for repair or otherwise, by simply dis-uniting
them, or can be attached to a Bath already fixed.

MORISO KT 5 S
VEGETABLE UNIVERSAL MEDICINES
Fifty years’ use of these Medicines by the public has proved their
efficacy and virtues, and the truth of Mr. Morison’s theory as to the cure
of diseases. Being composed only of Vegetable Matter or Medicinal Herbs,
they are found by experience to be harmless to the most tender age,
or the weakest frame, under every stage of human suffering ; the most pleasant
and benign in their operation ever offered to the world; and at the same
time the most certain in searching out the root of any complaint, however
deep, and of performing a cure, if within the reach of human means.
The Medicines consist of three sorts, tending to the same purpose—
that is to cleanse and purify the blood and fluids. They are named :
No. 1 MORISON’S PILLS, No. 2 MORISON’S PILLS,
THE VEGETABLE APERIENT POWDER.
All persons making use of the medicine are referred to Mr. Morison’s
work, the “ Morisoniana,” which is to be had from the Agents and Book-
sellers ; also to the directions wrapped round each box.
Sold in boxes at ls. l£d., 2s. 9d., and 4s. 6d.; family packets, 11s.
each. Also the Vegetable Aperient Powders, Is. l£d. per box.
MORISON’S UNIVERSAL OINTMENT.
This Ointment is recommended as the best external application in all
cases of Wounds, Cutaneous Eruptions, &c. In pots at Is. Ikl. and
2s. 9d. each.
Morison’s Pills, Powders, and Ointment are sold by the Hygeian Agents,
Chemists, and Medicine Vendors generally.
Just Published, price 2s. 6 d., “ The EXTRAORDINARY CURES effected
under the Hygeian System by MORISON’S VEGETABLE UNIVERSAL
MEDICINES.” May be had at the British College of Health, Euston-road,
London, and of all Chemists and Booksellers.
The following cases of cure have just been received ;
Cure op Bilious and Liver Complaint.
Dunstable, July 30, 1870.
Gentlemen —I have been a great sufferer with bilious and liver complaints.
Some short time ago, a Mr. Southcote, formerly of Exeter, persuaded me to take
some of your inestimable Morison’s Pills, and I am happy to say that a few
doses restored me to perfect health.—l remain, yours faithfully,
JAMES WHITE, Builder.
To Messrs. Morison and Co., British College of Health, London.
Cure op Paralysis.
Shelburne Falls, Mass., U.S., October 14,1870.
Dear Sir—l am an Englishman, and have been in America four years, and had
an attack of Paralysis on the 11th of June. I commenced using Morison’s Pills
on the 12th, and took them in doses of 40 per day for the first month, after which
time I could walk with the help of a stick. The second month I took 20 pills per
day, and at that time I could move about without any support. The third month
I took from 10 to 20 pills per day; and at the commencement of the fourth month
I began to work. I continue to use the medicine in my family, and recommend
it to everyone. The doctors around here all say they never knew such a remark-
able cure ; and, in conclusion, beg to thank our Heavenly Father that your Vege-
table Universal Pills have been the means of my recovery.—l remain, yours
gratefully, THOMAS HOWSON.

INDIA
KNIFE
HUBBEE
BOARDS
Retail from If. 6ci. Each.
The best and cheapest Article ever introduced to the
Public, for expeditiously and brilliantly polishing Knives
(when dressed with the Wellington Knife Polish). The
India Rubber, forming an elastic medium between the
Knife and Board, prevents Friction, and consequently the
Knives are not worn and injured as by other methods.
They polish* so rapidly that it does away with the
necessity of the Machines, and the annoyance occasioned
by their constantly being out of order, and when in that
condition destroying the Knives.
The WELLINGTON KNIFE POLISH is prepared
expressly for the above Boards, and Knives constantly
cleaned with it present the appearance of new CutlerV.
The operation is .cleanly, and free from dust and annoyance.

In the year 1872 there will be four Eclipses— two of the Sun, and two of the Moon—
not one of which will be visible in Victoria.
First. —A Partial Eclipse of the Moon on the morning of May 23rd. The com-
mencement of this Eclipse will be visible in Western Australia. At the maximum, only
one-ninth of the Moon’s diameter will be obscured.

Second. —An Annular Eclipse of the Sun on the morning of June 6th. The central
line passes through China, Burmah, and the south of India. This Eclipse will be
visible as a partial one at Fiji.
Third. —A very small Eclipse of the Moon on November 15th. At the maximum,
less than one-fortieth of the Moon’s diameter will be obscured.
Fourth. — A Total Eclipse of the Sun on the morning of December Ist. The central
line of this Eclipse passes through the South Pacific Ocean. This Eclipse will be
visible as a partial one, near the line of sunrise, in New Zealand and Fiji. The
greatest duration of the totality will be only forty-seven seconds.

Autumn commences on March 20th. I Spring on September 23rd.
Winter on June 21st (the shortest day). | Summer on Dec. 21st (the longest day).
Explanation of the Calendar.
Sun’s Rising and Setting.—These numbers show the mean time when the sun’s
centre, elevated by refraction, appears on the horizon, the eye being on a level with
that plane.
Moon’s Rising and Setting. —The same as for the sun, only that the moon is
more depressed by parallax than elevated by refraction. When the mark occurs,
it shows that the moon will only rise or set that day. Thus, on the 4th of January
the moon will only set at Melbourne. This arises from the lunar day being longer
than the solar. The moon, it will be seen, rises on the 3rd four minutes before
midnight; the next night she will not rise till twenty-three minutes past midnight—
that is, twenty-three minutes after the commencement of the sth.
Phases of the Moon. —The times are here given to the nearest minute when the
moon is respectively o°, 90°, 180°, and 270° of longitude from the sun. Apogee is the
time of her greatest distance from the earth, Perigee of her nearest approach.
Sun’s Declination.—These quantities show the angular distance of the sun from
the equator, measured on a meridian. They are given for apparent noon, or the
instant of the sun’s transit over the meridian of Melbourne, and are very useful
for determining the latitude by meridian altitudes, for which purpose they will serve,
without reduction, sufficiently near for most nautical requirements, the whole of the
Australian coast. Thus, suppose on the xst of January the altitude of the sun’s
lower limb at meridian transit had been observed to be 73 0 22', the height of the eye
being eighteen feet above the level of the sea, and the instrument having an index
correction of +4', the computation will stand thus :
Observed altitude of lower limb .. .. .. .. 73° 22' o"
Index correction .. .. .. .. .. .. +4
Dip 4
Apparent altitude of lower limb .. .. .. .. 73 21 50

True zenith distance .. .. .. .. .. 16 22 5
Sun’s declination .. .. .. .. 523 4 34
Latitude .. 539 26 39
B. & Co.'s Ed.]


The proper way of applying the declination may be easily inferred from the circum-
stance that the sun is vertical when on the meridian of that place whose latitude is the
same as the declination. As the sun was observed to be i6° 22' 5" north of the zenith,
the place of observation must be situated so much to the south of where the sun was
vertical; if the sun had been observed to the south of the zenith, the latitude would
have been 6° 42' 29" S. If the above observation be made on the meridian of Mel-
bourne (t4s° E. of Greenwich), the latitude thus obtained will be quite correct ; for
any other meridian, the declination would require a correction, which might be easily
obtained by interpolation, thus —as 360° : diff. of long. ; : diff. of declination in 24
hours: the correction required. But the maximum error of latitude caused by the
neglect of this correction will be less than two miles, and will be generally much
smaller between the limits of Cape Leuwin and” New Zealand.
The Sun’s Semi-diameter is used to reduce an observation of his limb to his centre.
Equation of Time, —This is the difference between true solar and mean solar
time ; it is used to find the latter from an observation of the sun. Thus, suppose on
the Ist of January a sun-dial, or any other solar instrument, gave the time ah. 36m.,
to get the mean time (which is that shown by a well-regulated common clock or
watch), we add 3m. 295., which makes the mean time ah. 39m. 295. If the observation
had been made at noon, we should have added 3m. 265., the same as in the column :
for any other time than noon, the equation may be easily found by interpolation. For
sun-dial purposes, however, the equation at nearest noon will be sufficiently exact.
The Right Ascension of the Mean Sun is the angular distance in time of the
mean or fictitious sun from the first point of Aries at noon. It is the sidereal time
at mean noon, or that which should be shown by a sidereal clock when the mean-
time clock points to 12 at noon. It is used to find the mean time when the sidereal
time is known, or the converse. Thus, suppose the right ascension of Sirius to be
6h. 39m. 305., this therefore will be the sidereal time when Sirius is on the meridian;
subtracting from this the sidereal time at the previous noon, we shall have the interval
of sidereal time that has elapsed since the preceding noon ; which, by means of the sub-
sidiary table, given for the purpose of converting sidereal into mean time, may be
easily reduced into an interval of mean time, as in the following example Suppose
on the Ist of January an altitude of Sirius had been observed which showed that
the star was 3 hours to the east of the meridian, the sidereal time would therefore be
3b. 39m. 305.; subtracting from this iBh. 40m. 145., increasing the former by 24 hours,
we get Bh. 59m. 16s. for the sidereal interval since noon; subtracting from this im. 285.,
we have Bh. 57m, 48s. for the mean time of the observation. By means of the table of
Semi-Diurnal Arcs, the mean times of rising and setting of the heavenly bodies may be
found in a similar manner. If the right ascension of the true sun is required, it may
be found by applying the equation of time to the right ascension of the mean sun.
Thus on the xst of January the right ascension of the mean sun is iBh. 40m. 145., and
that of the true sun is iBh. 43m. 40s.
The Moon’s Age is the interval elapsed at mean noon since the last new moon ;
it is given in days and decimal parts of a day.
Moon’s Meridian Passage.—This is the mean astronomical time at which the
moon’s centre passes the meridian, or due north of Melbourne. It is very useful for
finding the time of high water. The symbol near the time of new moon shows
that the moon will not pass the meridian on that day, the astronomical day beginning
at noon, twelve hours after the commencement of the civil day.
High Water at Williamstown. —The time of this table is civil mean time. It
has been computed for Gellibrand’s Point, on the assumption that the change tide
takes place at ah. 31m., as deduced by Captain Cox, R.N., the late Admiralty Sur-
veyor, from a discussion of the tide-gauge papers for the year iB6O. When the
mark occurs there will be only one tide that day. Thus, on the Bth of January
there will be only an evening’s tide. The times here computed may be taken as the
average ones when high water may be expected ; the tides at Port Phillip, however,
are so influenced by wind and other causes that the actual times of high water will
sometimes differ from the calculated ones by more than three hours. The supple-
mentary table for the outports has been taken from the Government Gazette, June
22, 1858.
Duration of Twilight.—This table shows the time taken by the sun to move
from 18° below the horizon to sunrise, and to the same distance after sunset, when
his rays cease to illuminate the sky.
From the observations made at the Melbourne Observatory, extending over a num-
ber of years, it appears that, on the average, the hottest period is from the 21st to the
25th of January, and the coldest from the 20th to the 24th of July.

At Midsummer, the days at Beechworth are about eight minutes, at Sandhurst six
minutes, at Castlemaine four, and at Ballarat two minutes shorter than at Melbourne ;
at Geelong, two minutes longer. About March and September the days will be nearly
the same length throughout the colony, and in June the former places will have the
days so much longer.

TIDAL SIGNALS.
Point Lonsdale.—The following tidal signals are exhibited daily at Point Lons-
dale flagstaff between sunrise and sunset; and the signal-keeper has instructions, if he
sees ships approaching the Heads and running into danger, to warn them by the Com-
mercial Code of signals. Strangers therefore should watch these signals. Flood-tide
Signals.—A blue flag will be hoisted half-mast high when the tide begins to flow in
the middle of the entrance between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean; it will be
kept flying all the first quarter of the flood tide ; second quarter, a blue flag at mast-
head ; third quarter, a red flag half-mast high ; last quarter, a red flag at mast-head.
Ebb-tide Signals. —During ebb tide the signals are as follows, viz. First quarter,
a blue flag half-mast higlv, with a ball underneath; second quarter, a blue flag at
mast-head, with a ball underneath ; third quarter, a red flag half-mast high, with a
ball underneath ; last quarter, a red flag at mast-head, with a ball underneath.
By attention to these signals the true state of the tide, which cannot always be ascer-


tained by the usual process of finding the time of high water, will be known, the
strength and duration of the tide being so much influenced by the wind and weather.
River Yarra. — The height of water in the Yarra is now shown by a self-acting
tide-gauge, erected on the outer red dolphin at the entrance of the river. To assist
persons on board vessels at a distance in ascertaining the height of water shown by
the self-acting tide-gauge, six projecting arras are fixed on its south side, the upper
edge of each arm coinciding with the lower part of each figure on the face of the
tide-gauge, which commences with the ten-feet mark. N.B.—The top of the indi-
cator, as it is moved up or down by the tide, shows on the face of the gauge the
height of water over the shoalest part of the fairway.
Geelong —The following tidal signals are exhibited on board the Geelong light-
ship, to indicate the depth of water on the bar;—One blue flag, 10 feet ; one ball.
io| feet; one ball, blue flag oxer, it feet ; one ball, blue flag under, 115 feet: two
balls, 12 feet ; two balls, bhie flag under , ia£ feet ; two balls, blue flag oz’er, 13 feet ;

flag between, feet; one red flag, 15 feet.

Cylinder Contents in Gallons.— A simple rule for finding the
capacity of cylindrical vessels in gallons, when the dimensions are taken
in inches, is to multiply the square of the diameter by the height, both in
feet, and by s|, which gives a correct answer to one gallon in twenty
thousand.
Water Pipes. — An excellent material for uniting water pipes is said to
be prepared by combining four parts of good Portland cement and one
part of uqslacked lime, mixed together in small portions in a stout mortar,
adding enough water to permit it to be reduced to a soft paste. Pipes
thus united have been in use more than six years without any leak.

Styptic Paper. —A mixture of one pound of gum benzoin, one pound of
alum, and four and one-third gallons of water, is to be kept boiling for
four hours, and skimmed from time to time. The water evaporated is to
be replaced by the same quantity of fresh water, and, as soon as the solu-
tion is cooled, it is to be filtered off. The paper is then dipped into it,
kept there until saturated, and then dried. When dry, a solution of the
perchloride is applied by a brush. The paper is folded up and preserved
from the action of the air in a piece of waterproof taffeta.
To Coat Iron with Silver. —Cast iron can be coated with silver by
means of a moderately strong galvanic battery, by using the following :
One ounce of lunar caustic is to be dissolved at a boiling heat in sixteen
ounces of distilled water, to which, diluted, two ounces of cyanide of pot-
assium are to be added. The whole is then to be mixed with forty-eight
ounces of water, in which one ounce of salt has been dissolved. The cast
iron is to be freed from any oxide just before silvering, by means of weak
nitric acid applied for a few minutes.
To Colour Zinc Black. —Zinc may be given a fine black colour by clean-
ing with sand and sulphuric acid, and immersing for an instant in a
solution composed of four parts of sulphate of nickel and ammonia in
forty of water, acidulated with one part of sulphuric acid, and washing and
drying it. The black coating adheres firmly, and takes a bronze colour
under the brusher.
To Remove Writing Ink. —To remove writing ink from paper without
scratching, apply with a camel’s hair pencil a solution of two drachms of
muriated tin in four drachms of water; after the writing has disappeared,
pass the paper through water, and dry.
Orange Marmalade. —Cut the oranges in half, then take out the pulp
and juice, separating all the skins and pips. Put the rinds into salt and
water for a night; the next morning put them into a stewpan with fresh
water. Let them stew until soft, so that a straw can be run through them
easily: cut the peels into thin slips. To every pound of fruit add one
pound and a half of coarse white sugar. Put the juice, pulp, and peel,
with the sugar, into the stewpan, and let it boil twenty minutes. Seville
oranges must be used, and the marmalade is better if kept six months.
The juice and grated rind of two lemons to every dozen oranges is a great
improvement.
The Use of Lemons.- One of the best “coolers,” internal or
external, is to take a lemon, cut off the top, sprinkle over it some loaf
sugar, working it down into the lemon with a spoon, and then suck it
slowly, squeezing the lemon, and adding more sugar as the acidity increases
from being brought up to the surface from a lower point. Invalids with
feverishness may take two or three lemons a day in this manner, with the
most marked benefit.


Directions for Restoring the Apparently Drowned.
Send immediately for medical assistance, blankets, and dry clothing, but
proceed to treat the patient instantly on the spot, in the open air. Efforts
to promote warmth and circulation must be deferred until natural breathing
has been restoed.
TO RESTORE BREATHING.
TO CLEAR THE THROAT
1. —Place the patient on the floor or ground,
with his face downwards, and one of his arms
under the forehead, in which position all fluids
will escape by the mouth, and the tongue itself
will fall forward, leaving the entrance into the
windpipe free. Assist this operation by wiping
and cleansing the mouth.
2. —lf satisfactory breathing commences, adopt
the treatment described below to promote warmth
and natural breathing. If there be only slight
breathing, or no breathing, or if it fail, then—
TO EXCITE BREATHING—
3. —Turn the patient well and instantly on the
side, and—
4. —Excite the nostrils with snuff, hartshorn, or
smelling salts, or tickle the throat with a feather,
&c ,if they are at hand. Rub the chest and face
warm, and dash cold water on it.
5. —lf there be no success, lose not a moment,
but instantly—•
TO IMITATE BREATHING—
6.—Replace the patient on the face, raising and
supporting the chest well on a folded coat or
other article of dress.
7. —Turn the body very gently on the side and
a little beyond, and then briskly on the face, back
again; repeating these measures deliberately,
efficiently, and perseveringly, about fifteen times
in the minute, or once every four seconds, occa-
sionally varying the side.
[By placing the patient on the chest, the weight
of the body forces the air out; when turned
on the side, this pressure is removed, and air
enters the chest.]
8. —On each occasion that the body is replaced
on the face, make uniform but efficient pressure,
wdth brisk movement, on the back, between and
below the shoulder-blades or bones on each side,
removing the pressure immediately before turning
the body on the side.
[The first measure increases the expiration, the
second commences inspiration.]
*** The result is—respiration or natural breath-
ing, and if not too late— Life.
CAUTIONS.
1. —Be particularly careful to prevent persons
crowding round the bod}-.
2. —Avoid all rough usage, and turning the body-
on the back.
3.—Under no circumstances hold the body up
by the feet.
TO PREVENT FUR-
THER DIMINUTION
OF WARMTH.
N.B.—These efforts
must be made very
cautiously, and must
not be such as to pro-
mote warmth and cir-
culation rapidly; for if
circulation is induced
before breathing has
been restored, the life
of the patient will be
endangered. No other
effect therefore should
be sought from them
than the prevention
of evaporation, and
its result, the diminu-
tion of the warmth of
the body.
1. -Expose the face,
neck, and chest, ex-
cept in severe weather.
2. —Dry the face,
neck, and chest, as
soon as possible, with
anything at hand; and
then dry the hands
and feet.
3. —As soon as
blanket or other cover-
ing can be obtained,
strip the bo iy ; but
if no covering can
be immediately pro-
cured, take dry cloth-
ing from the by-
standers, dry and re-
clothe thebody, taking
care not to interfere
with the efforts to
restore breathing.
CAUTIONS.
1. Do not roll the
body on casks.
2. Do not rub the body
with salt or spirits.
3. Do not inject
tobacco-smoke or in-
fusion of tobacco.
4. Do not place pa-
tient in warm bath.


Farmers’ anb Gardners' Calendar.
J A V II A R V.
KITCHEN GARDEN.—This month is generally too hot and dry to
admit of much being done in gardening operations, except in low
moist situations, where cropping can be carried on almost at any time.
Where water is plentiful and easily applied, young crops should be watered
once or twice a week, care being taken that the soil be well stirred with
the Dutch hoe after every watering. If rain or dull weather occur, a few
cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, broad and kidney bean, lettuce, pea,
onion, radish, and turnip seeds may be sown to a limited extent; with the
exception of the peas and beans, all the seeds should be slightly protected
from the intense sun by shading with calico, litter, or some other suitable
material. Early potatoes should be planted, for use in April.
Flower Garden. —Dahlias and roses should be looked after; the former
requiring staking, disbudding, mulching, and watering; the latter to be
pruned when necessary, so as to give a fine autumn bloom ; decayed flowers
should be removed, and every means used to render the plant vigorous.
Carnations should be layered. Chrysanthemums, phloxes, and other
herbaceous plants will want staking and thinning.
Farm. —Farmers will be busy harvesting the grain crops; when the
ground is cleared, lose no time in ploughing or scarifying the stubbles to
destroy weeds, and if the weather permit, turnips might be sown, and
■would yield good feed for sheep, and a good dressing of manure. Man-
golds, carrots, and other root crops must be kept clean by horse-hoeing.
>' E It K IT A It V.
Kitchen Garden. —Cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, spinach, and turnip
should be sown. Early potatoes may be planted largely. Celery and
leeks to be transplanted into trenches. Dig up any vacant ground in
readiness for autumn cropping ; the soil is pulverised and sweetened by
exposure to the atmosphere. Cabbage and cauliflower plants hould be
planted largely. If dry, water as last month.
Flower Garden. —Proceed with the propagation of favourite plants by
layering, cuttings, or otherwise. Plant at the end of the month a few
ayacinths, tulips, anemones, ranunculi, and narcissi for early blooming.
Sow stocks, larkspur, mignonette, &c. Take care that camelias, azaleas,
rhododendrons, and the like plants, do not suffer from want of water.
Climbers must be regulated, the stronger growing kinds cut back, and
others neatly tied up. All decayed flower stems or leaves to be removed ;
walks to be kept neat and orderly.
Farm. —The plough will be in active use this month, unless the weather
is very unfavourable. Sow turnips for sheep—also oats, Cape barley, rye,
and tares for green feed. Continue the use of the horse-hoe amongst
drilled crops. Look to your manure heap, collect everything that is
convertible into manure, and when thoroughly rotted, cart on to your
land.
M A KCH.
Kitchen Garden.—Sow cabbage, cauliflower, early horn carrots, broc-
coli, lettuce, peas, radish, spinach, and turnip. Kidney potatoes may still
be planted. Earth up celery. Top-dress asparagus bods with salt or sea-
weed, If new strawberry beds are required, plant runners as soon as you
can obtain them ; three-year-old beds should be destroyed.
Flower Garden.— Dahlias, hollyhocks, liliums, and Pompon Chrysanthe-
mums will now be in their prime ; liquid manure will prolong and enhance
the beauty of these flowers ; dead blooms must be picked off, or the plants


will be impoverished. This is the best month to sow hardy annual and
perennial flower seeds. Prepare your ground for planting shrubs, orna-
mental trees, &c.; if not already trenched, get it done at once. Her-
baceous plants can be divided, and planted where wanted ; carnations
and pinks may still be propagated by cuttings under a bell glass. Keep
all weeds down.
Farm.- —Ploughing will chiefly occupy the farmer’s attention. Plough
deep—the extra expense is trifling compared with the benefits derived.
In some districts wheat-sowing will commence ; see that the finest and
cleanest samples of seed are selected, and do not neglect to dress by using
a solution of blue vitriol, at the rate of 1 lb. to the sack. Sow lucerne,
Cape barley, rye, oats, tares, and Californian prairie grass. This is the
time for preparing land to plant live fences in—quick or whitethorn hedges
are the best; the ground should be ploughed and subsoiled.
AFRI Jj.
Kitchen Garden. —Finish manuring and digging ground ere winter
sets in. Take care that young crops of turnips and carrots are kept free
from weeds. Continue planting out cabbages, cauliflower, and celery ; the
latter would be much benefited by an occasional dose of guano water.
Sow peas (early varieties), broad beans, onions, parsley, endive, radish,
and spinach. Plant potato-onions, shallots, garlic, rhubarb, and horse-
radish. Earth up celery as required. Look to your herb bed; where
necessary, divide the roots, and make fresh plantations. If strawberry
runners were not planted last month, let them be this.
Flower Garden. —This is one of the busiest months in the year : most
kinds of evergreens, and ornamental and flowering shrubs, are best trans-
planted now, and any alterations that are to be made in laying out
grounds should be commenced. Take up gladioli, liliums, and other
bulbs that have done flowering ; store them away in boxes packed in dry
sand. Finish planting hyacinths, tulips, crocuses, narcissi, anemones,
ranunculi, ixias, &c., &c. Renovate edgings of camomile, thrift, box, and
thyme. For new plantations of roses the ground should be trenched and
heavily manured; if light soil, some stiff loam should be incorporated with
it. Propagate by cuttings any kind of soft-wooded plants you wish to
increase ; bell or hand glasses are required for this purpose.
Farm. —Oat sowing will commence in some places, but in cold districts
May or June are better months. For green feed, sow Cape barley and
oats : lucerne, clovers, and grasses of all sorts may also be sown,
previously testing their germinating powers by sowing a sample in a
flower-pot, that expense and disappointment may be averted. Young
crops of barley, oats, &c., would be much benefited if a pair of light harrows
were run over them. Potatoes should be lifted and stored, as they are
liable to a second growth if left in the ground.
.VI A Y.
Kitchen Garden. —Asparagus, rhubarb, and sea-kale beds will want
cleaning and manuring Sow' broad beans, peas, lettuce, onions, radish,
and spinach for successional crops. Plant out early cabbages and late
sowings of celery. Finish manuring and digging all vacant ground,
whether wanted for immediate use or not; bear in mind that turning
over ground in a wet state does it more harm than good. If ground is
wanted for other purposes, carrots, parsnips, and other tap-rooted
vegetables may be taken up and stored.
Flower Garden. —As dahlias and hollyhocks die off, the stalks should
be cut down and cleared away ; the former being taken up and housed in
a dry shed or cellar. Look over your seedling, annual, and other plants,
thin them where thick, and keep slugs and other vermin away. Prune


perpetual flowering, banksian, and other spring-blooming roses. Continue
planting evergreens and flowering and ornamental shrubs ; stake the same
when necessary. Propagate by cuttings fuchsias, roses, &c. Attend to
hedges, keeping them well clipped ; if new ones are required, use
hawthorn, furze, osage orange, or acacia, where strength is required ; if
light small hedges are wanted, the small-leaved prickly acacia. Cape
broom, sweet brier, or pittosporum, are the best.
Farm.—Complete wheat-sowing; also sow barley, beans, oats, peas,
rye, and vetches for seed. Finish sowing grasses, clovers, and lucerne.
Store turnips and mangolds if ground is required for other purposes.
J U X 13.
Kitchen Garden.—Get all heavy work in the most forward state possible.
This is the best month for planting all descriptions of fruit trees ; trench-
ing and deep draining are essential to their well-doing ; if soil is poor and
manure be needed, use bone dust in preference to guano. Commence
pruning fruit trees, beginning with those which have lost their foliage.
Sow to a limited extent cabbages, cauliflowers, broccoli, early carrots,
lettuces, and radishes. Make good sowings of broad beans, peas, and
leeks. Finish planting garlic, shallots, horse-radish, rhubarb, sea-kale,
and asparagus.
Flower Garden. —If possible, finish planting all kinds of trees ; choose
calm dull weather for the purpose of transplanting, and take care that the
roots are mutilated as little as possible. This is a good time for sowing
grass seeds for lawns and borders. Dig neatly your flower beds, adding
if necessary a little well-rotted manure. Finish pruning roses, flowering
shrubs, kc. Old rose stools that have been standing for years should be
taken up and replaced with young vigorous plants.
Farm.—Sow barley and oats largely either for hay or seed. Continue
sowing beans and peas. Prepare land for mangolds, carrots, potatoes,
maize, sorghum, chicory, tobacco, kc. The deeper the ground is worked,
the better will be the crop. On rainy days, numerous jobs indoors may be
done, such as mending and making pig troughs, hurdles, gates, &c.
J U JL V.
Kitchen Garden.—Plant largely of early potatoes ; sow parsnips upon
rich deep soil—the latter ought to have been trenched two feet or more.
Sow peas largely —Bedman’s dwarf, blue imperial, Champion of England,
Burbidge’s eclipse, climax, and alliance are among the best for general
purposes. Sow largely of the various kinds of broad beans in rows thirty
inches apart. Established plantations of rhubarb and sea-kale may be
forced by covering the crowns over with pots or slates, and covering these
again with fresh horse-manure. Plant globe artichokes in rich soil, in
rows four feet six inches by three feet. Sow main crops of onions, also
spinach, radish, and small salads.
Flower Garden.—lf former directions have been carried out, there
will not remain much to be done this month, with the exception of
keeping all the walks, borders, and beds neat and clean.
Farm.-—Continue ploughing and harrowing lands intended for spring
cropping. Hoe drilled crops. Continue sowing grasses, clover, lucerne,
and peas ; beans may still be sown in late localities. Oat and barley
sowing should be completed this month if the weather has been at all
favourable.
AUGUST.
Kitchen Garden.—This month will close the season for planting fruit
trees, kc., so that all diligence must be used. August is the chief month
for sowing seeds of various kinds —such as cabbage, cauliflower, carrot,
leek, lettuce, onion, parsley, parsnip, peas, radish, spinach, salsafy, and


scorzonera. If frames are obtainable, make up hot-beds for early
cucumbers, melons, vegetable marrows, &c. Tomatoes may be sown in
pots in a frame for planting out in October. Plant Jerusalem artichokes
and main crop of potatoes. Plant out cabbages, cauliflowers, leeks, oni'ons.
Flower Garden. —lf the manuring and digging of the flower garden be
not completed before now, it should be attended to at once. Tall growing
annuals will require tying up. Propagate fuchsias, chrysanthemums, and
climbers from cuttings. Repot plants commencing growth and wanting
pot room. Dahlias for early flowering may be started in a little bottom
heat; seedling nemophilas, larkspurs, clarkias, &c., may be transplanted
if too thick.
Farm. —Potato planting may be commenced now, but September is the
principal month for getting in the main crops. English barley can still be
sown. Oat and wheat crops should be rolled. Prepare land for sorghum,
beet, and mangold crops.
SEI’TKMBK K.
Kitchen Garden. —This is the busiest month in the year for seed sowing
—most of the hardy vegetables may be sown, and towards close of month
all the tender sorts. Potatoes of all kinds should bo planted for main
crops. Make a sowing of peas for succession. Early longpod beans may
still be sown in low-lying ground. Sow scarlet runnners, dwarf French
beans, beet, carrot, cucumber, melon, vegetable marrow, pumpkin, onion,
radish, and spinach; mustard and cress should be sown every fortnight;
sow celery on a hot-bed. Tomatoes and capsicums may be sown in warm
situations ; if any have been raised in a hot-bed, harden a little and plant
out. Plant Chinese yams and sweet potatoes in well-trenched soil. Fruit
trees will require attention ; with the finger and thumb displace any
superfluous shoots, and if time can be spared, the blossom buds should be
thinned, especially of young trees.
Flower Garden. —The floriculturist has generally numerous insect
pests to annoy him in this month, such as green and black fly, red spider,
scale, andthrip, to say nothing of slugs, caterpillars, &c. Gishurst’s com-
pound will be found the best remedy for the former. Plant out calceolarias,
cupheas, geraniums, heliotropes, pansies, salvias, &c. Sow both tender and
hardy annuals.
Farm. —Sow carrots, cbickory, maize, mangolds, parsnips, and tobacco.
Plant potatoes. Lucerne and grasses can still be sown. Keep the horse-hoe
at work between drilled crops, and plough in weeds on fallow ground.
0 4 TO K i: u.
Kitchen Garden. —lf season is moist, carrots, leeks, onions, and pars-
nips may still be sown. Sow largely of kidney beans, early turnips, capsi-
cums, tomato, cucumber, vegetable marrow, pumpkins,melons, and parsley ;
also tall-growing varieties of peas—they will not grow very high at this
season of the year. Plant out largely cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and
celery; also, sow again for succession. Weeds will grow apace ; choose a fine
sunny day for hoeing them down, and rake off when withered, or perchance
a shower may come, and a great number of them start into growth again.
Flower Garden. -Balsams, cockscombs, globe amaranthus, zinnias,
and other tender annuals should now be sown, if not already done ;if
sown in pots, and transplanted into flower beds, place in sunny weather
an empty flower-pot over the patches of young plants; remove the pots
every evening, or the plants will grow up weak and spindling. Climbing
will be growing fast, and will require constant trimming and training.
See that flower beds are kept filled by turning cut large plants in pots.
Farm.— This is the last month that potatoes can be planted, except in
low-lying lands. Sow largely of maize and sorghum ; mangold sowing
should also be completed. Earth up early crops of potatoes with double-


breasted plough ; do not delay this operation too long, or you will injure
the fibres.
\ O V K M II i: K.
Kitchen Garden. —Beds of rhubarb and sea-kale that have been forced
should be cleaned off. Cease cutting asparagus, or you will weaken the
roots. Attend to cucumbers and melons ; if any have missed, sow again,
Stop leading shoots of cucumbers, to induce laterals. If tomatoes are not
planted against a wall or fence, they should be tied up to strong sticks,
and pruned moderately, or fruit will be small and few. This is the time
for preventing a great deal of pruning in winter; use the finger andthum,
judiciously in disbudding and stopping fruit trees ; thin the fruit where
thick ; increased size and superior flavour will be the result. Vines will
require frequent attention as regards training, tying, and thinning shoots.
Flower Garden. —Hybrid perpetual roses should have their shoots
pruned back immediately they have bloomed. Newly-planted shrubs or
plants suffering from hot sunshine should be protected by boughs of
tea-tree or wattle. Empty casks, with both ends knocked out, make very
good shelters, although rather unsightly. At close of month, budding
may be proceeded with. Flower seeds can still be sown, although with
greater risk of their well-doing than if sown earlier.
Farm. —ln some districts harvesting wall have commenced, and farmers
generally will have little time to attend to growing crops of mangolds,
potatoes, &e.; but if the weeding and hoeing of these are neglected, they
will soon tell tales. Maize and sorghum may still be sown.
U K C K M II K It.
Kitchen Garden. —Cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, and savoy may
be sown in shady places; peas, kidney beans, lettuce, spinach, and turnips
can also be sown, but not to any extent. Onions, carrots, and parsnips
will require thinning and weeding. Matured onion bulbs should be
harvested at once, or the sun will injure them for keeping. Plant out
early celery plants in trenches, and give abundance of water when
established. Early potatoes for seed, when ripe, should be taken up and
greened, by exposing them to the atmosphere for a few days, under the
protection of a shed or verandah.
Flower Garden. —Bulbs that have flowered and died away should be
taken up and packed in dry sand. This is the best month for planting
out dahlias for autumn blooming. Roses and fruit trees may be budded.
Newly-planted shrubs and trees will be benefited by having some rotted
stable straw spread on surface of soil, which should first be well stirred.
Farm. —Wheat harvest will be getting general in earlier districts : both
wheat and oats should be cut before being thoroughly ripe. English barley
should be fully ripe before being cut, in order that when used for malting
it may all sprout at once. Hoe and earth up potatoes.
THE VITE.
An oast or north-easterly aspect is best for the vine ; next best is the
north ; south-east may be good ; the west is the worst aspect of all. The
vine will succeed in almost any soil, but flourishes best in a deep,
calcareous, light ground ; it will thrive in any soil composed in part of
whole of volcanic debris, mixed with gravel or sand, and resting upon a
limestone formation. The best manure is bone dust, but in naturally
good soils no manure is needed. Trenching the ground is absolutely
necessary if large crops, fine fruit, and good flavour are desired; if a
retentive clay bottom, two to two and a half feet trenchimr will bo
sufficient, but if a fine loose porous subsoil, three feet will be better.
Draining is also essential to the well-doing of the vine, unless the ground is


well drained naturally. The distance at which vines should be planted
from each other depends somewhat on the soil, for if planted upon poor
hungry land, as a matter of course they will not grow so strong and
luxuriantly as they would on good rich soil. The trellis will no doubt
supersede all other modes of growing, when it becomes more known than
at present; the heaviest crops, the finest fruit and of the best quality,
are produced by this system. Plant the vines eight feet apart between
the rows, and twelve feet apart between the plants in the row ; one-year-
old plants are best. The majority of German and Swiss vignerons plant
their vines much closer than the plan just mentioned—viz., five or six
feet apart from row to row, and only two feet apart in the row ; others
again plant them four feet apart each way ; an acre planted thus will
contain about 3100 vines. The best time for planting vines is from the
beginning of June to the end of August, or in late seasons they may be
planted up to the middle of September.

Grass and Clover. —The following are the sorts and quantities of Grass
and Clover Seeds suitable to most soils, but the quantity of either kind
can be increased or reduced, attention being paid to the nature of the soil
and subsoil, so as to ensure early growth, with good bottom, nutritive
qualities, succession, productiveness, and permanency : —Per Acre : 12 lbs.
Perennial Rye Grass, 14 lbs. different kinds of Fescues, 4 lbs. Cocksfoot,
2 lbs. Foxtail, 2 lbs. Rough-stalked Meadow Grass, 2 lbs. Wood Meadow
Grass, 3 lbs. Timothy, 1 lb. Sweet Vernal—total, 40 lbs. Grass Seeds ;
with 2 lbs. White Clover, 2 lbs. Red Clover, 2 lbs. Red Perennial or Cow
Grass, 2 lbs. Alsike, 8 lbs. Clover.
Manures.— The following are the quantities of the undermentioned
manures generally applied to an acre of ground of ordinary quality:—2o
tons farm-yard manure, 10 cwt. crushed bones, 5 cwt. crushed bones and
1 i cwt. guano, 3 cwt. Peruvian guano. 2 ozs. of guano to the gallon of
water, or one part of cow-dung to ten parts of water, are customary pro-
portions for liquid manure.
Treatment for Seeds Supposed to have Lost their Germinating
Power.— Steep the seeds in water with a grain or two of oxalic acid, and
sow. Or place them in a temperature of seventy degrees, laid on flannel;
turn twice a day, keeping them moist and at a regular heat, being the
state most favourable to germination ; sow at the end of twenty-four
hours. lodine facilitates the germination of seeds; put a small quantity
in the water with which they are watered.
To Grow Celery in Winter. —Have the drills ranging north and south,
or near those points, so that the sun strikes the drill with full power.
Manure with a compost of turf and loose dung, which enriches the soil
.and keeps it light. For the winter crop the manure must not be worked
deep in the trench, but should be as abundant in the ridge as in the
drill, encouraging the roots to ramify all through the upper and warmer
soil of the ridge. Allow three feet for earthing.


Favourite Flowers and their Cultivation.
The Pansy comprises many beautiful varieties, all of which “sport” most freely
into myriads of diversifications of new forms and tints. The beauty of pansies
depends much on their cultivation and mode of treatment. In order to insure a
constant succession of bloom through the summer, a bed should be prepared with
good rich mould, about the month of March, in which young plants, that have
either been struck from cuttings or side shoots, should be placed about
nine inches apart. The flowers will begin to show themselves about the middle
of September, at which time the soil about the roots should be pulverised, and if
the weather is dry, water should be freely applied. A succession maybe obtained
from cuttings (which will readily take root if planted in a shady situation), for
the purpose of making new beds or replacing the old ones.
Thu Pink is a hardy flower, and no garden need be without it, for it will grow
readily in any tolerably dry and well-cared-for soil. If the soil of the garden be
not suitable, a mixture of yellow loam, garden soil, and well-decomposed stable
manure, about one-third of each, with some road-grit to keep it open, makes a
good compost. Plants for early flowering should be put out in beds the first
week iti June, and successional plants later in the month. About twelve inches
apart is a very good distance when permanently planted out. A top dressing of
well-decayed manure ought to lie applied early in spring, to bring the plants
forward lor blooming. As the plants spindle for bloom, only three or at most
four stems ought to be allowed to remain on each plant. These should be tied
to neat stakes, and as the buds appear, only three or four should be left on each
stem. In dry weather, water freely; in hot weather, shade the plants if extra
lino blooms are desired. The pink is readily increased by pipings, planted in
light sandy soil : when rooted, put into store beds for transplanting as desired.
The Polyanthus only succeeds in the more temperate portions of the
Australian continent, as it is extremely susceptible of injury from long-continued
heat; therefore the most sheltered situations should be chosen. New varieties
arc raised from seed, which may be sown in small pots in June or July, covering
the seed lightly with soil, and the covering closed with glass. The plants will
make their appearance in about six weeks ; when large enough, transplant into
other pots, watering very sparingly. Polyanthuses make nice borders or edgings
in suitable localities; elsewhere they should be shaded, or kept in pots in a
frame. The best soil is a light sandy loam. To have flowers of a flue size, thin
out all superfluous buds. Those in the centre are (he best to take away.
The Anemone is generally planted in March, the tubers being covered with
about two inches of a light sandy soil. When the plant appears above the
ground, and when coming into bloom, if the weather be dry, water moderately.
The beauty and continuance of the flowers will be promoted by judicious shade.
Window Gaudening.—Of hyacinths, for blooming indoors, either in pots or in
any of the various contrivances that are used instead of pots, strong bulbs should
lie selected and placed in succession. Place them in any dark, coo. situation for
three or four weeks, to allow of their making roots before exciting them into
growth. If pots are used, and these are doubtless the best, if not the most
ornamental, use good rich sandy soil, and secure perfect drainage, for a liberal
supply of water is required during the blooming period.
Gladioli.—This class of beautiful bulbous plants cannot be too strongly
recommended to all lovers of gay flowers. They are equally well adapted for the
autumn decoration of flower gardens, either in beds or borders, and of continuous
development when cut for the flower-vase. Any common garden soil will suit
them, if enriched by digging in a little well-decayed stable or cowyard manure ;
but the soil should be moderately deep and open, to allow the roots to descend,
ami be well drained.
PHLOXES.—About beginning of October take the strongest shoots from the old
plants, and root by placing in hot-bed, such as is used for propagating dahlias.
When rooted, plant in pots, ami repot as required. Plant out in rich soil by end
of November or beginning of December, and affording slight protection until
established, watering liberally, both while growing and when in bloom. They
bloom in March ami April, and the plants are at their best in the second season
of flowering. The principal points to be observed iu phlox culture are dwarflsh-
ness, flue foliage, and large heads of flowers.
Mignonnette is universally esteemed for growing in boxes or flower-pots,
particularly in town windows: and although generally treated as an annual,
yet if prevented from flowering too profusely, by pinching off most of the
flower-spikes, it will attain the size and habits of a small shrub, and last in
bloom for a lengthened period.


USEFUL RECIPES.
Curdled Milk.—To prevent milk from curdling, to retard its acid
change, it suffices to saturate the acetic and lactic acids which may be de-
veloped in it by the addition of a little bicarbonate of soda. About 15
grains of this alkaline salt to each pint of milk is sufficient and is harmless.
The worst “turned ’ milk may be restored to its normal state by adding
some bicarbonate of soda, in the proportion above mentioned, and again
boiling it.
To Make Cuttings Grow.- -A very excellent plan is to boil some
small potatoes until they are nearly done, and stick one on each slip,
before setting in the ground. Very few slips treated in this manner will
fail to sprout and grow with anything like ordinary attention afterward.
To Produce Large Strawberries.—Remove the soil around each hill
to the depth of half an inch or more, without disturbing the roots ; then
spread over an area of twenty inches in diameter a pound of finely
pulverised linseed meal or oil meal, and cover it over with mellow soil;
then spread a mulching of hay or straw two or three inches deep over the
entire surface between the hills. Should the weather be warm and dry, a
liberal supply of warm water daily will generally promote the growth of
both vines and berries.
Crystalising Flowers.—This is done by suspending or repeatedly
dipping them in water saturated with alum. This, however, can only be
done with dried specimens. The freshness and beauty of flowers can be
preserved by dipping them in glycerine.
Moss ON Flower Pots.—Ladies who are fond of cultivating flowers in
the house, will find great benefit to the plants by spreading a coat of
moss over the earth in their flower pots. This keeps the water from
evaporating, and the temperature more uniform.
To Renovate Black Silk. -Rub the silk all over on the right side
with a solution of ammonia and water (two teaspoonfuls of powdered am-
monia to a quarter of a pint of warm water), and smooth it on the wrong
side with a warm iron, and the silk will regain a bright black appearance.
To Clear a Room oe Mosquitoes.—Take of gum camphor a piece
about one-third the size of an egg, arid evaporate it by placing it in a tin
vessel, and holding it over a lamp or candle, taking care that it does not
ignite. The smoke will soon fill the room, and expel the mosquitoes.
Liquid Glue.—Three parts of glue, broken into small pieces, should be
covered with eight parts of water, and left to stand for some hours ; one-
half of chlorh3 T dric acid and three-fourths of sulphide of zinc must then
be added, and the whole exposed to a temperature of from 1 78° to 192°
Fah. during ten or twelve hours. The compound thus formed does not
gelatinise ; it only needs to be allowed to settle, and will be found most
useful for mending porcelain and glass as well as wood.
Artificial Yeast. —Place a quart of good strong yeast in a vessel, and
cover it up warm until it has well worked and has a good head on it; then
stir in sufficient maize meal or wheat meal to make into a stiff dough, and
flatten this out with the hands into cakes the size of the top of a tumbler, or
less. Lay these on a nice dry board or sieve, and dry in the sun or over a
fireplace, turning them every day until quite dry. If dried in the sun,
they must be brought in every night, otherwise the damp will injure them.
When dry pack away in tins in a dry place, as the slightest moisture in-
jures them. For use, mix one of these cakes in about a pint of warm water,
and with it make a batter in the centre of your dish of flour, or set a
sponge overnight, and proceed in the morning as usual with yeast bread.
One cake will raise twelve pounds of flour.
Insects on Rose Bushes.—Whale-oil soap and rain water, in propor-
tions of one to seven, sprinkled on bushes infected with aphis, rose-bugs,
slugs, kc., will prove effective in dispersing these pests


To Harden Plaster of Paris Casts. —lt is said that the addition of a
small quantity of finely pulverised n. rsh-mallow roots to calcined plaster
of Paris will prevent the mass, wheninixed with water, from hardening- so
rapidly as it commonly does, so as to prevent its applicability to many pur-
pose's. It will require nearly an hour to become thoroughly set; and then
it will be found to have acquired such an extreme toughness and tenacity
as to permit it to be filed, turned, and bored, and otherwise manipulated,
almost as satisfactorily as ivory, hone, or meerschaum. Mixed with dif-
ferent colouring matters, an excellent imitation of marble can be pro-
duced.
Red Dye for Wool.—A good, bright, red colour may be obtained in
the following way : —Stiff paste is made of lac dye and sulphuric acid, and
allowed to stand for a day. For dyeing ten pounds of wool, one pound of
tartar, two-thirds of a pound of salts of tin, and three-quarters of a pound
of the paste, are required. The wool must be boiled in the bath for three-
quarters of an hour, after which it must be rinsed and dried.
Paste Blacking.—B gills vinegar, 4 ozs. ivory black, 1 oz. oil of vitriol,
1 oz. sperm oil, 2 tablespoonfuls of brown sugar. Put the oil. ivory black,
molasses and sugar into a bowl together, stir them up well, then add the
vinegar. Let it remain two or three days before adding the vitriol; then
bottle, taking care to have the corks well resined. It is best to keep it six
months, but may be used directly.
To prevent Feathers working through Ticks.— Empty the feathers
from your tick, turn it wrong side out, and lay it on a table. Then, with
a piece of beeswax, slightly warmed, rub the tick thoroughly, giving the
entire surface a light coat of the wax. No more feathers will ever work
through that tick until the stuff is worn through.
To take Stains out op Silver or Silver Plate.— Steep the plate in
soap-lye for four hours; then cover it over with whiting wet with vinegar,
so that it may stick thick upon it, and dry bran, and the stains will not
only disappear, but the plate will look exceedingly bright.
Quicksilver Coating for Iron. —The iron is cleaned with hydrochloric
acid, and then immersed in a dilute solution of sulphate of copper with a
little of the acid aforesaid. The thin coat of copper produced thereby is
to be cleaned off ; the iron is then placed in a very dilute solution of cor-
rosive sublimate, with a few drops of the acid. The iron will now be
covered with a mercurial coat, which cannot be rubbed off. If washed
with muriate of ammonia solution, it will effectually prevent rust.
A Glue which will Unite even Polished Steel. —Dissolve five or six
bits of gum mastic, each of the size of a large pea, in as much spirits of
wine as will suffice to render it liquid. In another vessel, dissolve in
brandy as much isinglass, previously softened in water as will make a two-
ounce vial of strong glue, adding two small bits of gum ammoniac, which
must be rubbed until dissolved. Then mix the whole with heat. Keep in
a vial closely stopped. When it is to be used, set the vial in boiling
water.
Mosquitoes, Flies, Ants, kc. —A tincture prepared by macerating
one part of pyrethrum roseum in four parts of diluted alcohol, and when
diluted with ten times its bulk of water, applied to any part of the body,
gives perfect security against all vermin.
Varnish for Artists.—A good varnish for mechanical and architec-
tural drawings, maps, &c., is obtained by dissolving in one gallon of
alcohol one pound of white shellac, one-quarter of a pound of camphor, and
two ounces of balsam fir.
To Fasten Leather to Metal.— Steep the leather in an infusion of
gall nuts ; and, a layer of hot glue being spread upon the metal, forcibly
apply the fleshy side of the leather to it. It must dry under pressure.
The leather will be torn sooner than separate from the metal.


To Make Unfermented Wine.- —The grapes must be ripe and sound,
and ought to be black. Pick the fruit off the stalks. Break or squeeze
on putting them into an enamelled boiler, and then place on a slow fire.
When the piece boils take off the scum. Let it boil until seeds and skins
sink. Take off the boiler and let it grow cold. Strain through a colander.
Prepare a tapering flannel bag (very fine, like a jelly bag), and strain
again three times. Pour the juice or wine into clean bottles, filling to the
bottom of the neck. Then place as many bottles in the boiler as will
stand, and fill the boiler with cold water level with the wine in the bottles.
Then place on the fire, and when the water boils, boil for half-an-hour.
Take out one bottle at a time. Put in sound cork, and seal with resin or
wax. Put the bottles away in a cool place, and leave till wanted for use.
Wine made in this way will keep many years. It becomes brilliant and
clear, and retains the delicious flavour of the grape.
House Papering, —As many persons living in the country are obliged
to do their own papering, a hint or two will be timely. Walls that have
been whitewashed should be wet with alum water before applying the
paper. One edge of the paper should be removed with the shears before
the lengths are cut. Remember to match the pattern before cutting the
lengths. The paste should always be made the day before, as it should be
perfectly cold when applied to the paper. A very good paste may be
made as follows:—Put into a pot or kettle about a gallon of water: it will
take nearly that quantity for a room requiring from twelve to fourteen
rolls. Mix about a pint of flour with a very little water, just like dough
at first, making thinner afterwards; this avoids lumps. When the water
boils pour in tbe batter: Stir to prevent burning, and as soon as it boils,
turn into a milk-pan or convenient vessel, and let it stand until next day.
If it should be lumpy you must strain it.
Rats may be prevented from gnawing harness or other material which
absorbs by mixing with the oil applied a little cayenne pepper, say
a teaspoonfulto the quart.
Cement that will Resist Red Heat and Boiling Water may be
made ;■ —Dried clay in powder, 6 lbs.; iron filings, 1 lb.; make
into paste with boiled linseed oil.
Waterproofing Canvas. —One pound alum, one pound sugar of lead,
one gallon and a-half boiling water; when cool pour off the liquor, and
use as required.
Children should be taught to use the left hand as well as the right.
Coarse bread is much better for children than fine. Children should sleep
in separate beds, and should not wear nightcaps. Children under seven
years of age should not be confined over six or seven hours in the house,
and that time should be broken by frequent recesses. Children and
young people must be made to hold their heads up and their shoulders
back while sitting, standing, or walking. The best beds for children are
of hair, or, in winter, of hair and cotton. From one to one pound and a
half of solid food is sufficient for a person in the ordinary avocations of
business. Persons in sedentary employments should drop one-third of
their food, and they will escape indigestion. Young persons should walk
at least two hours a day in the open air. Young ladies should be pre-
vented bandaging the chest; we have known the worst diseases, terminat-
ing in death, which began in this practice. Every person, great and small,
should wash all over in cold water every morning. Reading aloud is con-
ducive to health. The more clothing we wear, other things being equal,
the less food we need. Sleeping-rooms should have a fireplace, or some
mode of ventilation besides the windows. Young people and others can-
not study much by lamp-light with impunity. The best remedy for eyes
weakened by night use is a fine stream of cold water frequently applied
to them.

Directions for
a Will.
The Will must be signed at the fc
some other person in his presence
■ end of it by the Testator, or by
by his direction. The signature
must be made or acknowledged by the Testator in the presence of two or
more witnesses, present at the same time. The witnesses must attest and
subscribe the Will in presence of Testator. A Will must be all in writing.
A gift to an attesting witness, or to the wife or husband of an attesting
witness, is void; therefore neither a legatee, nor the wife nor husband of
a legatee, should be made an attesting witness to the Will.
No particular form of attestation is necessary, but the following may be
used; if used, it must be copied and written at the end of the Will, below
the signature of the Testator:—“Signed by the said , the Testator,
in the presence of us, present at the same time, who in his presence have
subscribed our names as Witnesses.”
The Testator should appoint one or more Executors.
If, after the execution of the Will, any alteration be made in it, by
obliteration, interlineation, or otherwise, care must be taken that such
alteration be executed in like manner as the Will itself. The names of
the Testator and Witnesses should be written on the margin of the Will,
opposite every such obliteration, interlineation, or other alteration.
Wills may at any time be revoked; but Wills made by single persons or
widowers are absolutely void on their marriages after the date of the Wills.

THE ORIGINAL
CHLORODYNE,
Invented by RICHARD FREEMAN. Pharmaceutist-
ONE OF THE GREATEST DISCOVERIES OF THE PRESENT CENTURY.
It immediately relieves, and in most cases
cures, Consumption, Coughs, Colds, Influenza,
Bronchitis, Asthma, Hooping Cough, Diarrhoea,
Dysentery, Cholera, Spasms, Cramps, Rheuma-
tism, Gout, &c., &c.— See Medical Testimonial.
In Cholera, Diarrhoea, and Dysentery its
effects are most signal. It relieves pain, spasm,
and cramp, supports the system, keeps up the
warmth of the surface and extremities, at the
same time moderating the action of the bowels.
Conclusive evidence of the value of it in these
affections is afforded by the following: —from
The Right Honourable Earl Russell, who
graciously transmitted to the Inventor of Chlo-
rodyne, Mr. R Freeman, and to the Royal
College of Physicians of London, the following:—•
Extract of a Despatch from Acting Consul
Webb, dated Manilla, Sept. 17th, 1864:
“The remedy most efficacious in its effects (in
Epidemic Cholera) has been found to be Chlorodyne,'
and with a small quantity, given to me by Dr. Burke,
I have saved several lives. ”
FREEMAN’S ORIGINAL CHLORODYNE
produces therapeutical effects which are pecu-
liarly its own, and which are not approached by
ether preparations bearing the name of Chloro-
dyne. Eminent and scientific physicians made
affidavits that they have tested its effects in
careful comparison with those of “Dr. Collis
Browne’s Chlorodyne,” and deposed to “Free-
man’s” being in every way the preferable pre-
paration.
Numerous Testimonials from the most emi-
nent Members of the Medical Profession en-
closed with each bottle; also full and explicit
directions.

upon the Public—but which are entirely devout of its peculiar properties—
particular care is needed to ensure procuring
“FREEMAN’S ORIGINAL CHLORODYNE.”

SOLE MANUFACTURERS OF
Stocker’s Improved Patent “ THE ” Feeding Bottle,
and the “CRYSTAL” Feeding Bottle.
“THE” FEEDING
BOTTLE has long and fa-
vourably been known; and
The “ CRYSTAL” is
rapidly taking a prominent
lead in the Home and
Foreign Markets. The
former has a neat and
much improved screw top;
the latter has a glass plug,
and, with the exception of
the bone shield and india-
rubber fittings, is entirely
of glass. Both these tops
are less liable to breakage
or displacement than usual,
are liquid-tight, and have
simple but efficient valves,
which enables the child to
draw its food with perfect
ease from the bottle.

Opinions op the Press — The sweetest-toned instrument we have heard.
The most compact harmonium in use; powerful, yet small. It is astonishing
how such chords can be produced by an instrument measuring only, when
packed. 28-in. x 16-in. wide x 14-in. high.
