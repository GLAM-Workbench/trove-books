“SHARE AND
SHARE ALIKE”
“SAVE MATERIAL
AND MANPOWER”
“ Rationing is based on the principle
of share and share alike. It is therefore,
the fairest and most democratic system.
Rationing has been introduced to
strengthen our war effort. It is, there-
fore, the only realistic system for a
realistic people, who are determined to
win the war at all costs."
“ Many people think that rationing
is a means of keeping goods out of
their hands. That idea is entirely wrong.
Rationing is the only fair and workable
Way of making certain that every one
has a fair share of available goods."
“ You, by your personal economy
with clothes and other goods, will be
releasing men, women, material, and
machines for vital war production. You
will, therefore, he making a telling
contribution to the war effort. For the
first time in history our clothing pro-
duction is being planned, and this planning
is for the greatest public benefit."
R. V. KEANE,
(Senator)
Minister for Trade and Customs.
“ Clothes should be bought only when
you need them —if you don't need them,
leave them for those who do.”
“Simplicity and economy in clothing
are essential war measures because of
the saving they effect in material and
manpower."
" The remarkable willingness by the
public to accept restricted conditions has
shown that Australians have a high
sense of duty and recognition of our
Wartime obligations."
“ When I talk about co-operation,
it might seem strange as the public are
restricted from buying more than their
112 coupons will permit, but it is
obvious that there has been a general
acceptance of the spirit of rationing.
Newspapers, pmblic, trade unions,
women’s organizations and traders
generally have taken steps to ease the
effects of restricted buying."
A. W. COLES, ( M.H.R.),
Chairman of the Commonwealth
Rationing Commission.
The Purpose of this 800l £ is to provide a better
understanding of the reasons for, aims and methods of rationing. Only
from understanding can your full co-operation be expected.

RATIONING IS FOR
YOUR PROTECTION.
You have a right to a fair share of the clothing YOUR
country can make available.
Rationing protects that right.
You must be protected as citizens and as consumers.
Rationing gives you that protection.
You want to help Australia win her fight for survival.
Rationing is helping to win that fight. It is another weapon of war.
Fewer clothes are now being produced for the civilian
population than in peacetime because —
Less shipping space is available for importing materials;
Our own ever-growing armed forces and the forces of our
Allies have to be supplied.
It is impossible to meet normal pre-war demands for
clothing. Yet there is enough clothing to meet real needs
if we share and share alike —and the principle of rationing
is a fair share for all.
Clothes rationing enables planned production. It means that
production can now be organized to meet essential civil
needs. It is a step towards ending waste, towards preventing
shortages of some garments and surpluses of others.
Your coupons marked G and H must cover your whole
year’s purchases. The worst mistake you can make is to buy
without careful thought. You must plan to provide for the
future, paying special attention to winter clothing needs. If
you buy unwisely now, you may find later on that you
have to go without things you really need. Buy clothes
only when you need them.
If you don’t need them, leave them for those who do.

cooks, bakers, chefs, pastrycooks, butchers. It does not include such persons as green-
grocers, grocers, smallgoods shop assistants, cake and pastrycook shop assistants, milk
bar employees.
(68) Exceptionally Heavy wear Groups.
Where the wear on working clothes is so heavy that it is not
adequately provided for by the low coupon rating for standard working
clothes, sufficient additional coupons will be issued to enable the wearer
to purchase adequate working clothes plus about half the corresponding
ordinary civilian clothing.
A list of additional coupons to be provided to those engaged in heavy wear trades
is set out below, together with instructions how to apply for them. In preparing this
list the following procedure was adopted: —-
(1) Trade Unions and other bodies were requested to submit estimates of
the average number of standard working garments (including footwear)
worn in a year in different occupations.
(2) When more than one estimate was available, the different estimates were
compared and checked by consultation with the Unions concerned and
with other authorities.
(3) It was accepted that the wearing of special working clothes during the
day saves wear on ordinary clothes. An estimate was then made of the
contribution which workers could reasonably be expected to make towards
their working clothes from their normal issue of 112 coupons, on the basis
that approximately half the wear on the outer clothing of the ordinary
clerical worker is associated with his work. A man wearing special
working clothes is expected to contribute towards that clothing the same
number of coupons as a clerical worker uses at work.
(4) The total number of coupons required to provide necesary working clothes
was then assessed. From this the number of additional coupons required
by workers in certain occupations was calculated.

INDUSTRIAL CLOTHING
QUIZ.
(132) Do working clothes require fewer coupons than civilian clothes ?
Yes. Because of heavier wear on working clothes rationing is framed to allow
industrial and rural workers to purchase more clothes than the man who continuously
wears ordinary civilian clothes. A working shirt, trousers, and working boots require 15
coupons, whereas 34 coupons are required for equivalent ordinary civilian outer
garments. These working clothes may be purchased at lower coupon ratings at any
retail store.
(133) Why are coupons surrendered at all for industrial clothing?
All clothing is in short supply, and industrial clothing is drawn from the same
source as all other clothing including that for infants and children. If industrial
clothing were coupon free, it would open the way for some people to obtain excessive
supplies while other workers went short.
(134) What is the method of rationing adopted?
The only equitable and practicable method is to require the surrender of coupons
for all clothing and at the same time to ensure that each person, no matter what his
occupation, will have enough coupons to buy clothes he wears while at work and about
half for ordinary civilian clothes to wear away from work.
Effort to Save is Effort Well Spent 1


(135) What clothing, usually issued by the employet to employees free, either by
custom or under an award, can be purchased by the employer without his
having to collect coupons for it ?
A special permit to purchase such clothing must be obtained from the Deputy
Director. It includes boots or shoes made of rubber, goloshes, gum boots, clogs,
pegged (clean area) felt soled, steel toed, knee boots for fire fighters, industrial sheets
or aprons of types not in coupon free list, woollen caps (for explosives) and oilskins and
waterproof clothing, leggings, trouser legs, industrial spats, snow suit, and other outer
garments for wear in refrigerator chambers, pugarees.
(136) Can employers insist on employees maintaining pre-war dress standards?
No. Employers can not insist on the wearing of hats, gloves, stockings, sac suit
(if employee prefers slacks and sports jacket), special cuffs, decorative aprons,
headbands, or any special types of clothing. The gazetted regulation says “ A person
shall not, without the consent of the Commission, as a term or condition of any
contract of employment or contract for the performance of any work or services,
require any other person to wear or use garments or apparel of a particular type
or nature”.
(137) What articles used by industrial workers, are coupon free ?
Those articles which have little or no effect in saving wear on other clothing, are
coupon free, e.g., asbestos clothing. (Last in para. 53.)
(138) Can an employer insist on the wearing of uniforms?
An employer shall not insist on wearing of any uniforms not provided for in the
industrial scale or approved by the Commission. An employee prepared to give
coupons equal to the rates for civilian outer garments may, if he chooses, do so for
uniforms of other types.
(139) What provisions govern essential civilian uniforms?
Necessary civilian uniforms such as for firemen, police, &c. (see para. 55)
are available at coupon rates low enough to enable the wearer to purchase these
clothes, plus about half of the ordinary civilian garments. JLlniforms other than
those listed in para. 55 must be approved by the State Deputy Director of Rationing.
Wherever possible armbands should replace special uniforms.
(140) Must employees surrender coupons for approved uniforms and garments
issued by employers ?
Yes. This applies whether the employer retains ownership of the uniform or not.
(141) Can coupons be surrendered by instalments for some industrial clothes?
Yes. A proportion of coupons may be surrendered monthly after the average
number of garments annually issued to an employee has been determined. For
example, on the basis of two bib and brace or two waitresses’ overalls issued annually,
one coupon must be surrendered on the first payday of each month, as the alternative
to surrendering six coupons on the issue of each overall. In some cases the employee
is expected to surrender full coupon value when issued with overalls.
(142) Is there any provision for persons engaged on heavy manual labour and who
wear out clothing more quickly than those engaged on lighter work?
Yes. Standard types of clothing suitable for heavy manual work are provided at
special low coupon rates. The number of garments now listed as standard working
clothes has been extended to meet the needs of a variety of occupations. These
garments can be purchased in any retail store. (See list para. 52.)
(143) If an industrial job causes exceptionally heavy wear —heavier wear than
is catered for in the industrial scale, can additional coupons be obtained ?
Yes. Extra coupons are issued to workers in occupations where the wear on
clothing is exceptionally heavy. (See para. 58.)
Save Work-clothes Wear, and Do Your Share!


(144) What is the basis for issuing extra coupons for exceptionally heavy wear
occupations ?
Generally the basis is that after working requirements have been met it should bo
possible to provide about half of the corresponding items of ordinary civilian clothing.
(It should be remembered, however, that in general it is possible to provide only for
groups of people and that within those groups some may be slightly better off than
others.)
(145) Does this mean that the industrial worker receives preferential treatment
compared with the clerical worker ?
No. The Commission considers that half the wear on the outer clothing of the
ordinary clerical worker is associated with his work. A man wearing special
working clothes is expected to contribute towards that clothing the same number of
coupons as a clerical worker uses for work. This places him on an equal footing
with the worker wearing ordinary clothing all the time. Extra coupons are only to
meet exceptionally heavy wear.
(146) Can an employee who irreparably damages his clothing by an accident
during his employment, but not by ordinary wear and tear, have that
clothing replaced ?
If the employer under an award, or by established custom, either replaces the
damaged clothing free, or, makes to the employee a monetary grant to cover
replacement, the Deputy Director may issue a permit to buy.
(147) Can an employer obtain special protective clothing to be used on a
part-time job by a number of employees ?
Yes. This applies to clothing which can be worn by a number of employees to
do special part-time work but not for ordinary overalls owned by the employer such
as those worn by waitresses. The employer must apply for a permit to purchase.
(148) What happens if a person transfers to a job requiring special clothing?
The rationing scheme is sufficiently flexible to meet all cases of genuine hardship.
Individual cases must be put before tike State Deputy Director of Rationing, the
appropriate union or the employer.
TEA AND SUGAR.
(149) Does Australia normally produce enough sugar for its own requirements ?
Yes. Before the war Australia produced sugar not only for its own needs, but exported
thousands of tons overseas.
(150) Why then is sugar rationed in Australia today?
There are four main reasons :
(1) Transport of sugar from Queensland to the other States under war conditions
presents a grave problem. Sugar has been accumulating for some time
in storage depots at the centres of production, but shortage of transport is
preventing its distribution for normal trade purposes.
(2) The need to build up reserve stocks of sugar within the Commonwealth to meet
any war emergency, such as invasion, or severe bombing, must absorb large
quantities of Australian output.
(3) Manpower shortages on the cane fields, in the refineries and in sugar
distributing services, has also increased the problem of cutting and
marketing the cane crop.
(4) The Japanese conquest of the Philippines and the NJE.L, which are amongst
the world’s leading producers of sugar, deprived the Allied countries of such
vast quantities of sugar that new sources of supply had to be found. For
example, the United States lost 900,000 tons of sugar annually by the conquest
of the Philippines, and the capture of Java deprived the world of 1,600,000 tons
per annum. In all, the Japanese now have control of an annual production
of over 2,500,000 tons of sugar, thus cutting it off from its normal markets.
Australia agreed, therefore, to supply 180,000 tons of sugar annually to die
United nations to help make up the loss. Therefore, if sugar was not rationed
it would mean that Australians were eating sugar at the expense of less fortunate
people, of our allied countries.
What Britain Can Take We Can Take I


(151) Why is tea rationed?
Japan’s conquest in the N.E.I. alone apart from other tea producing areas, deprived
Australia of 80 per cent, of her normal tea supplies. The strain which was therefore placed
on the other tea producing countries still under allied control, including Ceylon and India
was extremely great. Shipping difficulties complicated the position, still further reducing
the amount of tea Australia was able to obtain. To ensure, then, that a just distribution
was made from available stocks, tea was rationed under the coupon system.
(152) What is the principle of tea and sugar rationing?
It is the same as for clothes rationing, that is, the same fixed ration of both commodities
was made available to every member of the community on the basis of “ A fair share
for all”.
(1 53) What is the tea ration ?
On October ISth, 1942, the tea ration was increased to two ounces a week; four
coupons (each coupon enabling the purchase of two ounces of tea) becoming available
for four weekly periods. Thus four tea coupons will enable the purchase of a half pound
packet of tea. The ration period may be increased or decreased from time to time
according to the bulk stocks of tea available. Any increase or other change in the
ration is announced in the newspapers.
(154) Can tea coupons be used at any time?
No. They can be used only during the period allotted for them. Unlike sugar
coupons, they cannot be used at a later date.
(155) What will happen when all the tea coupons are used?
The page of "C” coupons in the Ration Book will be used when the present
“Tea” coupons expire during ths period December 14,1942, to January 10, 1943.
Retailers must make sure that when “C ” coupons come into use for tea purchases,
tea is not supplied for coupons from the books of children under 9 years of age.
(156) Can tea be bought by mail order?
Yes. A person buying tea by post may himself cut the coupons from the household
ration books, provided the name and address of the person ordering the tea is written
clearly across the coupons.
(157) For what are “ B” coupons to be used?
Sugar. You must surrender “B” coupons for any type of sugar, whether raw,
brown, white, castor, icing, or icing mixture.
