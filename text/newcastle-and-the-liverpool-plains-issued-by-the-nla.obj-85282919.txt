i 1 A journey to Boggaßri along the Great Northern
Line affords ample opportunity of viewing. some of I
h, the State’s scenic attractions and industrial activi- j |
IB ties, since the traveller crosses deep gorges such as ' j
|d Broken Bay, and mountain ranges as'at Murru- ]
rundi, while the train passes through the heart of :y
'jj our most productive mining centre, the. Newcastle
to Coal Fields.
After passing the suburban area at Hornsby, and
the rounded, undulating, low hills about Sydney are
W left behind, the track descends from the shale and
A clay formations and we reach tlje Hawkesbury T
bi sandstones. The country hereabouts, though not N
so productive, possesses a rugged charm by reason a
y of its deep bold headlands and ravines, at the ||
gli bottom of which the blue waters of - the .bay- glisten k, 1
kj| in the sunlight. The line crosses the Hawkesbury b;
; River-on a ; seven-span steel bridge, the largest in ■


HAWKESBURY BRIDGE.
Australia, and the route for the next few miles
winds round the mountain foot almost at water
level. Many charming marine resorts, where
Sydney’s citizens are wont to spend enjoyable


'1 1
Sdays in fishing, are passed along the Brisbane I
y Water here traversed. Gosford, famous for its I
fruit, is passed at 50 miles, and a fleeting glimpse ]l I
of the State nursery is caught as the train flashes | 1
by. As the numbers on the mile-posts creep up A
towards the century dense hardwood forests fly \
past. Pretty hamlets whose sidings piled high with
railway ties indicate a fame for these hardwoods, |
which is not only local but which reaches from
South African to far Manchurian Railroads. The jjg!
dairy farms and orchards mark the rise of other {,l
industries as the timber falls. The railway from
Morrisset, 74 miles, to Cockle Creek, 94 miles, runs
in places close to the western shore of Lake Mac- ; 1
quarie, a picturesque sheet of salt water, 20 miles A
png by 6 miles wide. This locality is destined to
be one of the most thickly populated portions of 1 1
the State, for the coal measures outcrop here, and
workable coal in immense quantity is available A
when required.
At Cockle Creek is one of the largest smelting
works in Australia. The chemical fumes from the
, works have killed most of the trees in the vicinity. ’)
It is a pretty spot and a favourite resort of the
A residents of Newcastle and Maitland districts. A A

Il this point all round the Lake. The smoky murk on
W the horizon proclaims the approach to Newcastle, N
1,1 the second Port of the State, and the greatest
l,| coal emporium of the Southern Hemisphere. jl
Newcastle, situated 104 miles by rail, and 64 by S|
|i sea, from Sydney, has a population of 16,126. With *|
|| its suburbs this number swells to about 75,000. -t|
The annual outward shipping, not including coast- 1 3
wise traffic, numbers ,1,221 vessels, the tonnage of ■ |l|
Ipi which reaches the total of 2,044,000 tons. The
p output of coal in the adjacent fields last year was Is
;,y 6,059,000 tons valued at over millions sterling. ’ K
l; j Great as the output is, the shipping facilities are ||
of corresponding magnitude. The wharves are
S lighted by electricity, and hydraulic cranes each
j'| capable of handling 25 tons, transfer the contents yl
1;| of a coal truck to the hold of a vessel in a few 3 |
djj seconds. These cranes frequently run day and f 3
m night. The harbour is protected by breakwaters Sj
b on the north and south, and with the Hunter
!y River and its navigable arms, the Williams and
k the Paterson, make a highway for a mosquito ii
|| fleet of-steamers serving a wonderfully rich dairy- ||
tfi farming district.
ivi The line bends away from Newcastle in a north- ||
U western direction as it traverses the fertile Hunter
dj River Valley. p

SHIPPING AT NEWCASTLE.
Maitland is passed at 119 miles. Ihe Maitland
district has a population approaching 20,000; the
city stands in the centre of one of the finest agri-
cultural tracts in the State and adjacent to almost
inexhaustible measures of excellent coal. Ihe
alluvial flats of the Hunter River are so rich that
the farmers have;, in many places, removed their
dividing fences, so eager are they to utilize every
available foot of land for the cultivation of lucerne,
that wonderfully productive fodder plant which


here yields as many as eight crops annually and j I
averages between 3 and 4 tons to the acre. Many S|
agreeable days might be spent driving among the rij
lucerne, dairy and mixed farms, orchards and
vineyards that closely occupy this land of milk M
and honey. In the immediate vicinity are the 11
important agricultural towns of Morpeth, Paterson, M
Clarencetown, Dungog, Hexham, and Raymond thj
Terrace. k
Singleton with a district population of 10,000 is K
the next town of importance, situated 148 miles
from Sydney. Fruit is grown profitably and dairy- 11
farming is extensively carried on. The district is g
famous for its breed of horses, and many an aristo- ]3
crat of the turf who has brought his owner fame t|l
and fortune hails from Singleton. The total num-
ber of horses in N.S.W. last year totalled 578,000. •
This upper part of the Hunter Valley contains a i|
large number of stud establishments, the head- K|
quarters of stations further back in the State. Si
A Cottage Hospital, costing complete in K
every detail, and second to none in New South IB
Wales, has recently been erected through the benefi- B
cence of Mr. A. A. Dangar. Three fine bridges fi
that here span the Hunter, beautiful parks, and a H
fine show-ground all testify to the progressiveness 51 1
and wealth of its citizens. H

lb A HERD OF CATTLE—LIVERPOOL PLAINS. ||
Muswellbrook, at 179 miles ; Aberdeen, 186 miles; ||
Scone, 195 miles.; Murrurundi, 219 miles are im-
l| portant towns next passed in succession. They
llj are centres of extensive pastoral and agricultural j,l|
M fields, and large, drafts of high-class cattle and |M
|[;4 sheep bred on the surrounding rich pastures may
jbjj h& seen entraining for market or local freezing and |l
| ; i packing works. Over 5,000,000 sheep are annually
jO slaughtered in the State, and about 62,000,000 lb.
1 1 of mutton is exported.


After leaving Murrurundi the line ascends sharply |L
|| to cross the Liverpool Range, but nearing the
|'j summit plunges through the mountains and emerges |!
y on the rich Liverpool Plains, where for mile after ||
1 1 mile Australia’s fairest wheat fields smile.
Quirindi, at 244 miles, a place of busy flour-mills
p is passed, and the junction town of Werris Greek is
next reached. At Werris Creek the special sleeping
P| car will be detached from the mail train, and after
breakfast on Wednesday morning an engine will be
® in readiness to convey the visitors further on their
|| journey.
S : The Main Northern Line continues due north from
p Werris Creek, passing Tamworth at 382 miles. This-
|t j beautifully situated town on the Peel River has a
pj population of ,8,600, and is, the centre of a rich
P agricultural district which produces wheat and
H other cereals, lucerne, fruit, and wine. While I||
S New South Wales was still in the pastoral stage of ,k|
a its existence, immense tracts of good wheat country U
V were alienated to graziers. Under the Closer g
Settlement Act, large areas are repurchased by the
i; l;j Government and made available for small settlers,
ij One effect of this Act has been that owners have
of their own volition subdivided their estates, and

made them available in small areas on easy terms. I
The Tamworth district presents a notable instance l|Jj
,j of the popularity of this movement and an area of i ; ;
■;i 300,000 acres has recently been acquired by the
Government for subdivision. The first 232 farms • 1
aggregating 100,000 acres were taken up within a
; 1 day or two after becoming available.
The line now climbs from the rich basalt plains
to the New England Tableland, a. granite plateau :
[ " with here and there as at Guyra, outcrops showing dd;
! the craters of extinct volcanoes.

The city of Armidale, ■ 359 miles from Sydney, d';;
has a district population of 7,250, and centres a
large pastoral and agricultural district. Precious
V metals abound in workable deposits, and coal is .
, now being mined.
G ■ 1
Glen Innes is 423 miles, and the border town of ,y
Tenterfield, 481 miles from Sydney, and 244 miles d”
from Brisbane.

The route lies along the North-western branch y
of the Northern Railway system from Werris Creek,
; I and traverses plain country where his majesty |
■ | sheep reigns supreme. The merino wool of New d;-
South Wales is the finest the world knows, fetching
the highest prices. Last year there were 44,000,000 t i

;


sheep in New South Wales, which produced
367,000,000 lb. of wool, valued at
sterling.
At Curlewis the effect of the. closer settlement t
policy lately adopted by the Government is evi- jk]
denced by the increasing areas brought under the
plough, and the black-soil plains in many places
are assuming a golden hue as the harvest time 3
approaches.
Gunnedah, at 295 miles from Sydney, situated.on |Ji
I the Namoi River, a tributary of the Darling River,
has a district population of 6,000 persons. Formerly jyj
a pastoral centre solely, it has now flour-mills, and
two collieries in active operation, and is becoming • *|
S as well known on the wheat market as the Wool G|
g , Exchange or Flemington stockyards.
At 10.30 a.m., Boggabri, 319 miles from Sydney, bi
a town with a population of a little 'over 1,000, is L
reached ; here the visitors will alight and j’ournpy k!
1 i miles by road to Ghoolendaadi Station, the |jj
j property of Mr, J. K. Clark. p i :
The line continues in a north-western direction,
passing through Narrabri at 353 miles, situated on
an affluent of the Namoi River. It has a popula- G
ki. tion of 2,500, and is a typical centre of the wool-
raising-industry. Branch lines from here lead to
Walgett and Collarendabri, on the Darling River.


The Main North-Western Line trends more to the
ip north now, and Moree, a town of 2,450 inhabitants i
: ’ is reached at 413 miles. An extensive pastoral 14
d; district stretches in every direction This part of |
; the country is watered from underground, some of
‘ | the artesian bores of the district yielding as much
I as 1,000,000 gallons of water per diem.

The Government Experiment Farm, irrigated by
bore water, at Moree, has achieved great results, •
not only in the production of fodder plants, but in i|
; 1 vegetables and fruit.
Inverell, the terminus of the North-Western
,j Line, is 93 miles east of Moree by rail, and stands
in the centre of a fine agricultural and pastoral
district, with a population of 7,300 persons. For
some years the demand for land has been steadily
growing, owing to the increasing number of dairy
1 farms, orchards, and vineyards. The district has L
G considerable mineral wealth, including tin, silver, and
' i precious stones.
The visitors will leave Boggabri on Wednesday,
G at 4-30 p.m., and arrive at Werris Creek at 615 p.m. I
i for dinner, which latter station will be left at G
9’2i p.m., arriving in Sydney on Thursday morning
