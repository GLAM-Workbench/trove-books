Australia’s Response
A PATRIOTIC SONG
Dedicated
To Australia’s valiant sons who voluntarily
enlisted when the Empire called in her
hour of need, and who by their unprece-
dented acts of heroism and deeds of daring'
covered Australia with imperishable gTory.
1914 - 1919
“Fortes Fortune Juvat”
Fortune aids the brave.")
AUSTRALIA’S RESPONSE was written on
the occasion of two brothers going to the war
in 1915, and is now published for the first
time with a stirring musical accompaniment,
as a fitting Souvenir of our Joyful Peace
Celebrations. To the true Australian spirit
maybe attributed the ready response of our
brave men, and that indomitable spirit alone
made it possible for them to accomplish the
“great things” that led to victory and the
preservation of liberty, which is dearer than
life itself.
SYDNEY. JULY 19th, 1919.
This beautiful souvenir of the greatest event in the world’s

Australia’s Response
Britannia’s Call, To Arms! To Arms!
Shall ne’er resound in vain,
We speed to meet the common foe
To fight with might and main.
We pray Dame Fortune take a hand
And lead to victory,
Then speed us back to our dear land,
The land of liberty.
Australia! Australia!
Pearl of the Southern Sea,
Our prayer for thee shall ever be
God bless our Land and Liberty.
With courage and Dame Fortune’s aid
We’ll press the foe right sore,
In Freedom’s name, we’ll play the game
And enter victory’s door.
When peace with honor be proclaimed
And all oppressed are free,
God speed us back to our dear land,
The land of liberty.
Australia! Australia!
Pearl of the Southern Sea,
Our prayer for thee shall ever be
God bless our Land and Liberty.
- ALFRED B. CAMPBELL.
