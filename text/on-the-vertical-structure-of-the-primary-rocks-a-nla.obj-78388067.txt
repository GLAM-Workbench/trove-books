SOME NOTES ON THE PRINCIPAL GEOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THE KALGOORLIE
GOLDFIELD.
CHAS. G. GIBSON, B.E. i
(Of the Geological Survey of Western Australia.)
AUTHOR?S PREFATORY NOTE. ?The following article makes no pretence to the claim that it is a complete geological
report on the district. Strictly technical matters have been avoided as much as possible and lack of space has compelled the
exclusion of much argument which would necessarily be chiefly of a technical nature.
In a more complete and detailed report one or two of the writer?s divisions of the rocks would possibly bear further sub-
division this being particularly the case with the series grouped in this paper as "coarse-grained amphibolites;? as however this
possible? further subdivision in no way affects the economic aspect of the question the writer has neglected it in favour of the
one broad and general classification. ...... t
This paper therefore claims only to put forth in a very broad way the writers conception of the mam structural features of
the field with special reference to economic conditions.

rpHE importance of Kalgoorlie, which has
| been responsible for more than one half
of the total gold yield of the State,
renders some reference to its salient geological
features necessary, by way of preface to the
series of articles on mining practice, for experi-
ence in most mining fields of the globe has shown
that many mining failures have been due
rather to a want of knowledge, or true appre-
ciation of, structural geology than to any lack
of engineering training.
General Topography. ?The chief topographi-
cal feature of the Kalgoorlie goldfield is a main
central ridge of hills trending roughly north-
north-west and south-south-east, and reaching its
maximum altitude in Mt. Gledden ?better known
as Maritana Hill ?which rises to a height of
some one hundred and fifty feet; the ridge has
a length of about four miles and dies out in a
southerly direction just beyond the south end of
what are known as the ?Boulder Belt? mines.
On each side of Ibis central ridge are wide flats
draining southerly and extending laterally, on
the eastern side for, say, five miles, and on the
western for about three. On the east side of
the eastern valley is another rather more con-
spicuous ridge of hills also trending roughly
north-west and south-east and having a
maximum altitude of possibly a couple of
hundred feet; along this ridge of hills are situ-
ated the mining centres of Boorara and AVater-
fall (Golden Ridge). The western flats are also
in their turn Hanked by a low ridge of hills, less
conspicuous at their northern end but well de-
fined at their southern. Both the eastern and
western valleys?if they may be termed such ?
drain, as before stated, southerly into the exten-
sive salt lake or marsh known as Gnumballa or
Hannan?s Lake, which starts but a short dis-
tance south of the Boulder Mines and trends
away in a south and south-westerly direction for
many miles. On the western side of this salt
marsh and some three miles to the south of the
Boulder mines is a small conspicuous clump of
hills, having their highest point in Mt. Hunt,
the most prominent landmark in the district,
which rises to a height of possibly some four
hundred feet. These hills are more or less con-
nected ?by a westerly extension ?to the main
western ridge.
The town of Kalgoorlie is situated on the
western fall of the main central ridge north-
wards from its middle point, and the mines are
along the line of the ridge, the ?Golden Mile?
being at its southern end, the underlying rocks
of the valleys being?as will be explained later
non-auriferous, or practically so.
General Geology.?The original rocks of the
Kalgoorlie district were of sedimentary origin,
viz., shales, soft sandstones, grits, conglomerates,
etc. ?with possibly interbedded lava flows ?laid
down horizontally in probably pre-Cambrian
time on a gneissic or granite floor; these were
by earth movement afterwards tilted into their
present highly inclined positions and sub-
sequently intruded by large masses of basic and
ultra-basic igneous rocks (amphibolites, quartz
diabases, porphyrites, peridotites, etc.), these in

turn being intruded by a small series of later ridge two to three miles further west ?or rather
acidic rocks (quartz and felspar porphyries).
Slight further earth movement has then taken
place causing considerable shearing and fault-
ing of the rocks, the former (the shearing) re-
sulting in the formation of the lines along which
the auriferous lodes of the field occur.
The accompanying geological map which em-
braces the main mining portion of the field shows
the present relative extent and position of the
more important of the various classes of rocks
found on the field. These may in a general way
be grouped under the following nine heads: ?
(1.) The Ancient Sediments (shales, sand-
stones, grits, conglomerates, etc.).
(2) The Calc-schists.
(3) The Fine-grained Amphibolites (repre-
senting the older ?greenstones").
(4) The Quartz-diabases.
(5) The Coarse-grained Amphibolites
(later or intrusive ?greenstones?).
(6) The Peridotites (intrusive ?).
(7) The Porphyrites.
(8) The Quartz and Felspar Porphyries
(newer intrusives).
(9) The Recent Deposits (sands, loam,
laterite, etc.).
The Ancient Sediments. ?These consist of
shales, soft sandstones, mica and talc schists,
grits and conglomerates. They are of very con-
siderable extent and are found on both sides of
the main complex of igneous rocks, the belt on
the western side being of by far the greater
development and interest. This belt starts some
four miles west of Kalgoorlie and has a width
of roughly ten or twelve miles, its general trend
being north-north-west and south-south-east;
how far northerly it runs is not known, as every-
thing is hidden in this direction by an extensive
covering of loose sand and loam; southerly it is
known to extend beyond Wollubar?some twenty
miles from Kalgoorlie?but appears to be nar-
rowing down in this direction and probably does
not run much further. The rocks of this series
are mostly soft banded-sandstones, but they also
comprise shales, mica-schists, grits and con-
glomerates ; they have a prevailing strike of
roughly 25 degrees west of north and dip steeply
to the west. Good natural sections of these sedi-
ments can be seen along the small ?break-
aways? forming the western edge of the lake
country some six miles south-west of Boulder;
good examples?more especially of the sand-
stones ?are also seen in some of the old mine
workings near Binduli and in one or two old
shafts on the eastern foot of the conglomerate
south-west. An interesting variation from the
soft sandstones is seen about a mile on the
western side of this ridge and half a mile south
of the Coolgardie road; here there is a con-
siderable development of a hard compact lamin-
ated sandstone carrying a large percentage of
black mica (biotite) in small flakes, and closely
resembling in general appearance a fine-grained
biotite gneiss.
The most interesting feature, however, in con-
nection with these sedimentary rocks is the
�/
occurrence of a well-defined series of coarse con-
glomerates interbedded in the sandstones and
grits. These have their greatest development at
a point some eight and a half miles south-west
of Kalgoorlie, where they form a well-marked
ridge trending roughly north-north-west and
south-south-east and extending for several miles
both ways; this ridge is crossed near its north-
western end by the main Coolgardie road at a
point a little more than seven miles from the
Kalgoorlie Post Office. There are at least three
main bands of conglomerate in the series, and
taken together with the intervening bands of
soft sandstone, they have a maximum thickness
of well over a thousand feet. They are steeply
inclined and dip with the enclosing rocks, i.e .,
at an angle of seventy-five to eighty degrees to
the west. The matrix of the conglomerate beds
proper is a fairly soft, slightly micaceous sand-
stone, practically identical with the surrounding
rock, while the pebbles and boulders ?rarely
more than six inches in diameter ?consist of
banded and jasperoid quartz, black cherty
quartz, hard white quartz, quartzite, quartz and
felspar porphyry, felsite, granite, etc. The
pebbles, etc., are as a general rule set fairly
closely together in the matrix and are well water-
worn and rounded; they have, however, since
their deposition been ?together with the enclos-
ing beds ?subjected to considerable pressure and
shearing, and usually split fairly readily in one
direction; were it not for this defect they would
probably prove of considerable value for use as
pulverisers in tube mills. (There is, however,
one place where pebbles of hard flinty quartz
are especially numerous and apparently less
ready to split than usual; this spot is in a small
ravine on the eastern side of the ridge about a
mile and a half south-west of the Coolgardie
road and less than half a mile on the north side
of the Boulder-Kurrawang road; it might be
worth investigation by local metallurgists.)
An interesting fact to note here is that in the
neighbourhood of Mt. Squires, in the Warburton


Range district, Mr. Frank Hann, the well-known
brahman and explorer, has reported the occur-
rence of large bands of vertically-bedded con-
glomerates running for miles and forming a
steep well-defined ridge of hills. This is the
only similar occurrence that the writer has heard
of in Western Australia, and from Mr. Hann?s
description and from seen specimens of the con-
tained boulders, he (the writer) is inclined to
the belief that these beds are similar to the Kal-
goorlie (?Kurrawang?) conglomerates, and, if
so, it may be that other rocks in the district are
also similar to those at Kalgoorlie, and that if
a second ?Golden Mile? is to be found this may
be the district in which it is to be looked for,
more especially as auriferous ?greenstone?
(amphibolite, etc.) country is known to occur
in the Warburton district.
On the eastern side of the main central Kal-
goorlie ridge is a second series of sedimentary
rocks, these occupy the valley between the Kal-
goorlie and Boorara ridges and have a lateral
extent of some three to four miles; the general
trend of the belt is roughly north-west and south-
east and it runs in these directions for a con-
siderable number of miles, its exact limits not
being known. The rocks of this series?in keep-
ing with all the others on the field ?strike about
thirty degrees west of north and dip steeply
to tile west; they consist for the most part of
shales, soft sandstones and grits. A good sec-
tion of what appears to be the western edge of
the series can be seen in the old Phoenix brick
pits just on the southern side of the Kanowna
road and about two miles from the Kalgoorlie
Post Office.
A third series of sedimentary rocks is also
found on the eastern side of the Boorara ridge,
extending from Kurramia almost to Kanowna,
or roughly four miles; this belt also runs ap-
proximately north-west and south-east, and the
rocks are very similar to those of the Binduli-
Kurrawang ?or western ?series, viz., soft sand-
stones, grits, and conglomerates; they strike in
the prevailing north-north-west to north-west
direction, and as usual dip steeply to the west.
The conglomerates of this series differ from
those of the western in that they are of much less
extent and not so well defined; the beds are also
much more weathered. A section showing the
conglomerate bed can be seen in a small cutting
about a mile and a half along the Kurramia
wood line; the band is here about a hundred
feet thick and is interbedded with soft sand-
stones; the pebbles and boulders an* mostly of
hard blue quartz with quartz and felspar por-
phyries?the latter being greatly weathered.
All the sedimentary rocks of the district are.
for all practical purposes, non-auriferous, and
therefore of no great economic importance.
The Calc-schists . ?These, as can be seen from
the map, form the eastern portion of the main
auriferous series and. next to the quartz-diabases,
are the most important series on the field. The
rocks are essentially fine-grained, but vary some-
what in colour and general appearance; typi-
cally they are dark grey on fresh fracture with
a somewhat blotchy appearance, and are
characterised by numerous minute veins of
calcite running through them in all directions;
they break readily in almost any direction and
frequently show a slight development of scaly
chlorite along the cleavage planes ?when these
are present. A less typical type is darker, finer
grained, more compact, harder and does not
exhibit the same amount of schistosity; it is
merely a less sheared and less altered form;
this type differs but little in hand specimens
from some of the finer-grained chloritic diabases.
These rocks were probably originally a basic
lava how, possibly at one time interbedded with
the sedimentary series; owing to the extreme
alteration that has taken place in them their
original structure has been almost completely
obliterated, and they now consist essentially of
an indefinite mixture of chlorite and carbonates,
with only occasionally traces of their original
crystalline form left; in addition to the chlorite
and carbonates microscopic investigation shows
the following minerals to be present in small
quantities: ?sericite, albite, zoisite, quartz,
ilmenite, rutile and iron ores.
In their original form the interlacing and
interlocking of the original mineral fibres and
crystals would give a certain degree of tough-
ness to these rocks, but, owing to the almost total
obliteration of this structure by replacement of
the original minerals by finely crystalline and
non-crystalline carbonates, this toughness has
been destroyed and the rocks fracture readily,
and this fact, together with their general com-
parative softness, makes mining operations in
them comparatively easy and cheap; moreover,
owing to the less frequent occurrence of joint
planes and ?heads? this class of country after
opening up stands much better than much of the
quartz-diabase and amphibolite country.
The Fine-grained Amphibolites. ?These are
found on the western side of the northern por-
tion of the coarse-grained amphibolite, at Somer-
ville. about two miles along the Coolgardie
road, and also on the eastern side of the calc-


hornblende and chlorite with no great economic
schist belt; portions of these areas are shown occasionally small crystals of felspar. A micro-
on the accompanying map. In places they very
closely resemble the rocks of the calc-schist series
?/
and with them probably belong?in the main?
to an older series of ?greenstones," being pos-
sibly a closely related lava flow or intrusion.
Typically, the rocks of this series are of a dark
green colour, mostly massive, and very fine-
grained; they consist apparently almost entirely
light-green
scopic examination of them shows their consti-
tuent minerals, in a typical specimen, in addition
to the hornblende, chlorite and felspars to be
calcite, epidote and various iron ores; in some
specimens the hornblende has entirely disap-
peared and is replaced by greenish chlorite.
As far as known this series is to all intents
and purposes non-auriferous and therefore of
importance.
