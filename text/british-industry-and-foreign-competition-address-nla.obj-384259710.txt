appreciate it as a privilege to have the opportunity of
addressing the members of the Melbourne Chamber of
Commerce on the subject with which I propose to deal
this afternoon.
Living among you as the representative of the mother
country, my duty is to uphold her credit and good name
in the estimation of Victorians. I have had many oppor-
tunities of vindicating her claim to naval supremacy.
To-day my purpose is to show that she has not lost her
greatness in the arts of peace.
As an opening observation I may appropriately mention that the
comparative efficiency of British and foreign labour, with which I have
to deal to-day, was also the subject of my maiden speech in the
House of Commons, delivered in 1869. It has been with me a life-
long study, to which my attention was first directed as the son of
a man who had acquired a large experience in enterprise at home
and abroad.
It is not going too far to say that the security and the greatness
of the British Empire depend on the continued ability of our workers
in the staple industries to meet foreign competition. We should not
aim at a monopoly of the world’s trade. It is vital to us to be able
to hold our own. From time to time our self-satisfaction is rudely
disturbed. We hear notes of warning. We are told that our old
supremacy is lost, that British wages are too high, that our merchants
are supine and inactive, that our manufacturers are wanting in tech-
Iknowledge, in invention, and the power of adaptation. A recent


publication entitled “Made in Germany,” is filled with severe criticisms
and melancholy forebodings. I believe them to be groundless, and I
propose in the present address to bring together the essential facts.
The United Kingdom, the United States and Germany are the
three foremost industrial nations of the world. The United States is
a country of high wages, Germany of low wages; the United Kingdom
occupies an intermediate position. As the most decisive test of their
efficiency in production, let us compare the statistics of their exports
of manufactures. In 1895, with a population of 37,750,000, the
exports of British produce were £226,169,174. With a population of
49,428,000, the exports of Germany were £165,535,000. With a
population of 63,000,000, the exports of the United States aggregated
793>393>°00 dollars (£165,280,206). Taking manufactures only, in
1895 the exports of the United Kingdom aggregated in value
£196,000,000. For 1894 the exports of German manufactures may be
put in round figures at £100,000,000. In 1895 the exports of manu-
factures from the United States were 183,595,000 dollars (£38,511,454).
In the exports of the United Kingdom raw materials constitute
little more than 7 per cent, of the total. In the German exports raw
materials constitute on an average of years approximately 20 per cent,
of the total. They form 80 per cent, of the exports of the United States.
Having given the totals for the three countries, the following tables
show the recent movement of British trade in the leading branches :

world have been calculated at about -£133,000,000, and no less than
£73,000,000 or 55.2 per cent, of the total may be credited to the

11. We receive in produce the large income derived from British
investments abroad.
If we examine the leading lines of trade, in 1895 the United
Kingdom took £2,500,000 more of French silk goods, and £1,000,000
more of woollen goods also mainly from France. Imports of leather
showed an increase of nearly £1,000,000. We imported more iron
manufactures, boots and shoes, and paper and strawboards.
Passing from imports to exports, the first six months of 1895
showed a decrease of £766,000 or 0.7 per cent. In the half-year,
ending December 31, 1895, a brisk revival commenced, which has been
well sustained to the present time. The exports advanced from
£108,910,000 in 1894 to £120,051,000 in 1895, being an increase of
10.2 per cent, in value and 8.57 in quantity. The year’s exports
showed a shrinkage of £8,600,000 in the export of cotton piece goods
to India. In 1894 the trade was unduly inflated by importations in
anticipation of the import duty on cottons. Increased shipments to
China, Japan, Chili, and the Argentine Republic reduced the total
loss in 1895 to £3,400,000. Turning to the United States, the exports
increased by more than £9,000,000. Woollen goods increased from
£309,324 in 1894 to £1,464,591 in 1895; and worsted tissues from
£125,900 to £4,832,144. The increase of £600,000 in the exports of
linens was chiefly to the United States.
Germany is our best customer among our continental neighbours.
In 1895 she took our products to the amount of £20,647,000, an
increase of nearly £3,000,000 as compared with 1894. The shipments
of woollen yarn increased by nearly a million. The improvement
extended to nearly all classes of textile manufactures, and to many
categories of iron and metal manufactures.
Commenting on the increase in the trade with Germany, the
“ Economist ” observes ; “ The objection pretty frequently heard of
late to ‘goods made in Germany’ might apparently be used with some
force in that country with regard to ‘goods made in England.’”
In the trade with British possessions in 1895 exports to Austra-
lasia reached a value of £17,383,000, or £1,358,000 more than in 1894.
The gain was distributed through all branches. The improvement of

£ 2,200,000 in the exports to South Africa was mainly in metals and
machinery, supplemented by increases in the shipments of woollen
and worsted goods and apparel.
Having given the figures for the leading branches of trade in
1895, the progress of our export trade with the principal foreign
countries for the last three years is shown in the following table :

In the exports to British possessions in 1896, India has taken
£1,800,000 more than in the first half of 1895 in cotton piece goods,
£400,000 more in railroad iron, and nearly £300,000 more in textile
machinery. The increase of £2,600,000 in our shipments to the
Australian colonies, and nearly £2,000,000 to South America, em-
braces all classes of textile, iron and steel manufactures.

For the first half-year of 1896, the British trade with foreign
countries aggregated £78,202,000 as against £73,546,000 for 1895.
The exports to the United States were reduced from £13,504,000 to

British Industry and Foreign Competition.


£11,253,000, the decline being mainly in woollen goods. The exports
to Turkey fell from £2,825,000 to £2,042,000. We need not look far
to find an explanation of these decreases in our trade. In our exports
to other countries, and especially to Russia, Germany, Holland, Bel-
gium, France, China, Japan, and the Argentine Republic, the growth
might be described in the glowing language of Mr. Gladstone as an
advance by leaps and by bounds.
The expansion in the export trade from the United Kingdom to
European countries in 1896 has extended to most of our industries.
It was especially marked in iron and steel goods and machinery.
The gain of over £1,000,000 in our exports to China, and a some-
what larger increase to Japan, were mainly in textiles.
By the last mail we have received the Board of Trade tables to
the end of August. The total export of British textiles for the eight
months was £72,359,999, showing an average increase of 7,8 per cent.
In metals the total British export was £33,230,720, being an increase
of 19.2 per cent, on 1895. In iron and steel the increase was 25.6
per cent.; in machinery 13.9 per cent. In apparel of all descriptions
the increase was in equal proportions. In cycles it was very large.
Having given the general statistics of the export trade of the
United Kingdom, we may proceed to measure our rate of progress
with that of our most formidable competitors.
The people of the United States excel in ingenuity, invention,
and the successful application of machinery. They are second to
none in vigor and industry. Thus far, however, they have made no
serious attempt to gain a footing in the neutral markets, American
manufacturers look for profits far beyond the modest returns of
3 per cent, or less, to which in the British textile and metallurgical
industries we have for long periods been reduced. In the United
Kingdom and Germany compensation has been sought for the fall in
prices in the extended volume of business.
Under existing conditions, we have to look to Germany alone as
a really formidable competitor. The commercial interchange between
the United Kingdom and Germany was summarised for the year 1894
in the “Economist” of nth January last. The leading figures are
given in table VI,

in British imports of sugar from Germany is from £3,452,443 to
£4,022,335. Our sugar refiners are not unable to supply the demands
of the home market in a fair competition. The German manufacture
of beet sugar is an artificial trade created and maintained by a lavish
bounty.

In so far as relative efficiency in great industries can be measured
by the interchange of trade, no symptoms are visible of decay in the
United Kingdom. Germany, as it has already been said, is by far
the most formidable of our rivals. But we have not been unable to
hold our own. Our exports to that great industrial country, consisting
mainly of manufactures, show a sustained and rapid growth. Our
imports from Germany are not at present increasing in an equal ratio,
and they consist mainly of food and raw materials.
Having dealt with their reciprocal interchange of trade, it will be
interesting to compare the exports of domestic produce from Germany
and the United Kingdom to foreign countries. The ebb and flow
through a long series of years may be traced in the following table
compiled from the Statistical Abstract: — (See opposite page) .
The table shows the marked progress of Germany between 1886
and 1892, In 1894 the exports of Britain once more showed a greater
relative advance. We have continued to gain to the present time —
and British trade is becoming more diversified. If in some directions
our progress is barred by tariffs, we have found new fields elsewhere.
In European countries Germany has to some extent supplanted the
United Kingdom. In the East we have fully held our own. Taking
our trade as a whole we have kept pace with others. We are still
the first nation of the world in industry and commerce.
Having given perhaps more than sufficiently the statistics of the
position, let us turn to the opinions of some leading authorities.
For the United Kingdom we can have no more weighty judgment
than that of the Royal Commission on Technical Education. Having
visited the leading industrial establishments of France and Germany,
of Belgium and Switzerland, the Commissioners expressed their
admiration of the remarkable development of their resources and the
perfection attained as well in economic administration as in technical
skill. In some branches of industry, and more especially in those
requiring a knowledge of organic chemistry, as for example in the
preparation of artificial colours from coal-tar, Germany had unques-
tionably taken the lead. In sugar refining the German application of
Strontia had constituted a new departure in the art. In the econom-
ical production of coke they found the United Kingdom slowly
following in the steps of her continental neighbours. The ventilation

of deep mines by means of exhausting fans had been brought to
perfection in Belgium, earlier than in the United Kingdom. For the
utilisation of water power the turbines used in Switzerland were the
most perfect that had anywhere been devised. The export from
Verviers to Scotland of woollen yarns carded and spun by machinery
made in England from South American wool purchased in Antwerp,
was quoted as an instance of a special trade established by intelligent,
careful, and persevering attention to details and by the cheapness of
labour in Belgium. The ribbon trade of Basel, that in velvets and
silks of every kind at Crefeld, and in mixed fabrics at Chemnitz were
examples of recently established or transformed industries, which, in the
view of the Commission, had rarely been excelled in boldness of enter-
prise by anything of the same kind accomplished in the United
Kingdom. The Commissioners attributed much of the success of our
continental rivals to more painstaking pliancy, greater thrift, and to
the general cultivation and the knowledge of modern languages and
economic geography usually possessed by continental manufacturers.
It will be evident that the Commission fully recognised the skill,
and, in some branches of industry, the superiority of other nations;
yet, with the expansion of trade and commerce elsewhere fully in
their view, what is their final summing up ? Great as the progress
of foreign countries had been, and keen as was their rivalry in many
important branches, the Commission had no hesitation in stating their
conviction, which they believed to be shared by the continental
manufacturers themselves, that taking into consideration the state of the
arts of construction, and the staple manufactures as a whole, the people
of the United Kingdom still maintained their position at the head of
the industrial world.
From the report of the Commissioners on Technical Education, I
turn to Mr. Jeans, the Secretary of the British Iron and Steel
Institute, who accompanied the delegation of employers and employed
engaged in the metal trades of Great Britain, which last year visited
the Continent. In his volume entitled “ England’s Supremacy ” Mr.
Jeans pronounced judgment as follows :
“No single nation can expect to be equally to the front in all manufactures.
Climate, soil, natural products, the genius and character of the people, and many
other varying circumstances, conjointly determine what shall be special to each.
British Industry and Foreign Competition.


“All continental nations, like our own, have built up special industries by a
steady and careful regard to their requirements. In those industries their artisans
have attained superior skill and aptitude, as our own operatives have done in
cottons and woollens. Other industries, again, have been built more or less upon
local resources, and England is not so destitute of such resources that she need
grudge them to others. But, in a general way, it may be affirmed with the
utmost confidence that, in regard to industries that are followed on a large scale,
England remains facile princeps."
Turning to foreign opinion, one of the most interesting publica-
tions of the present year is that admirable volume on the “ Labour
Question in England,” by a French writer, Paul de Rousiers. In the
preface, by Monsieur Henri de Tourville, a tribute is paid to the in-
dustries of the old country, which it is highly gratifying to receive.
“Nowhere,” says the writer, “and at no period of the world’s history
has there been an industrial power to match England. America, vast>
energetic and adventurous, has not equalled it, notwithstanding the
colossal scale of all she undertakes. Lying as it were midway between
the old Continent and the new, the British Isles form the great
central factory of the world, and other manufacturing countries are
but subordinate industrial suburbs. The shores of these islands have
become the great commercial quays of the world. There is no nation,
small or great, to which the commerce of England is not either a
boon or a menace. But what strikes the observer even more than
England’s power is the co-existence and independence of two phe-
nomena which have been supposed to be mutually opposed to one
another, namely, the greatest development of modern industrial
methods and the most advantageous position of the workers.”
I propose on another occasion to examine the position of the
workers of the United Kingdom in relation to the reward of labour.
My object to-day is to insist on the efficiency, skill, and industry by
which they have won the high place they have long held and still
retain.
I now turn to an American authority, Mr. Schoenhof, formerly
of the Consular service of the United States, who was commissioned
by the Department of State in Washington to inquire into the
economy of production and the state of technical education in Europe.
In his essay on the “Economy of High Wages” Mr. Schoenhof at-
tributes the superiority of Europe over America in so far as it obtains
British Industry and Foreign Competition.


to the existence of a great body of working people in the older
countries born and trained to the trades in which they are engaged,
and possessing an indefinable skill of eye and touch, which shows
itself in their fabrics,' and which enables them to give to the goods
which they produce special attractiveness in general appearance, colour,
design and finish. Referring to Great Britain in particular, Mr.
Schoenhof says that what gives that country her firm hold of the
world’s trade in cotton goods is not cheap labour, as America, her
only possible rival, has demonstrated. It is not alone the saving
effected by giving a lighter cloth, but that the English really give a
sightlier fabric. In colour and finishing he awards them the palm for
unmatched excellence.
“There is,” as he says, “no manufacturer or workman so proud
of his rule-of-thumb efficiency as the English, and, speaking from
practical results, no one else has a right to be so proud of it.
Strange to say that in many lines of manufacture where technical
skill and science play the greatest part, Germany, with all the help
it receives from its school training, has not been able to approach
the superiority of British work. The colour and finish of cotton
velvets, for instance, and of silk plushes, to name only a specimen or
two, are of such acknowledged superiority that the English more than
hold the market against the rivalry of Germany. That country has
not been able to supersede England in neutral markets.”
Having examined the statistical position impartially, and under
the guidance of the best authorities, just cause has certainly been
found for pride in the country to which all members of the British
Empire look as their mother land. Marvellous indeed must have been
the commercial and maritime enterprise; marvellous the industrial
aptitude of that people, who, living under gloomy skies in a small
island, in area scarcely a four-hundredth part of the habitable globe,
and drawing the raw materials for their work, mainly from distant
countries, have yet made themselves to so large an extent the manu-
facturers for the whole world. The figures which have been brought
together show clearly that the United Kingdom retains the leadership
she has long held among the nations. The superiority of the United
Kingdom is the more conspicuous when we look not only to the total
volume of our trade but to the proportionate value per head of the
British Industry and Foreign Competition.

population. The author of “ Made in Germany ” points to the fall in
the value of the exports of British produce per head of the population
from £8 is. in 1872 to £5 11s. 3d. in 1894. For the practical
purpose it will be sufficient if we limit our review to the period of
fifteen years embraced in the statistical abstracts of the Board of
Trade. Sir Robert Giffen, in a return recently published, gives the
comparison of the United Kingdom with Germany as follows: —
Mr. Mulhall, in his “Statistical Dictionary,” sums up the situation
in telling figures
“ Great Britain, with a population of 36,000,000, produces wealth to the
amount of £1,247,000,000 per annum; France, with 37,500,000 population, produces
£965,000,000; Germany, with 45,000,000 population, produces £850,000,000; Russia,
with 80,000,000 population, produces £760,000,000, and Austria, with 38,000,000
population, produces £602,000,000. England, with the smallest population and
shorter hours of work than prevail abroad, produces by far the most wealth.”
Having developed our trade and commerce to the extent which
has been shown in the statistics brought together in the present paper,
surely it is not unpatriotic to admit a greater solicitude for the well-
being of the people of the United Kingdom than for a further large
development of its vast productive industries.
A few years ago a pamphlet bearing the title “ Merrie England ”
was published in London and Manchester under the auspices of the
Clarion, a well-known socialistic newspaper. There was much
exaggeration in the pamphlet as to the miserable conditions of
industrial life in England. But many will agree with the author that
nothing is less to be desired for the old country than that it should
become the one workshop of the world. Already there are large
districts of England where every tree is withered, and scarce a blade
of grass is seen. Many millions know nothing of the rural delights
described by Mrs. Browning with the voice of melody: —

British Industry and Foreign Competition.


I flattered all the beauteous country round,
As poets use,—the skies, the clouds, the fields,
The happy violets hiding from the roads,
The primroses run down to carrying gold;
The tangled hedgerows, where the cows push out
Impatient horns and tolerant churning mouths
’Twixt dripping ashboughs,—hedgerows all alive
With birds and gnats and large white butterflies
Which look as if the May-flower had caught life
And palpitated forth upon the wind;
Hills, vales, woods, netted in a silver mist,
Farms, granges, doubled up among the hills;
And cattle grazing in the watered vales,
And cottage chimneys smoking from the woods,
And cottage gardens smelling everywhere,
Confused with smell of orchards. “ See,” I said—
And see ! Is God not with us on the earth ? ”
-A urora.
Who that is acquainted with the Black country between Birming-
ham and Wolverhampton would wish its area extended, or desire that
the lovely dales of Lancashire should be filled up with more factories
than are already there ? Better far to look beyond the seas, to
Canada, to Australia, to the United States, as the field in which our
vigorous race may find room for the wider employment of their
energies and their powers. It was finely said by John Bright: —
“ I believe that in the centuries which are to come it will be the greatest
pride and the highest renown of England that from her loins have sprung a
hundred millions —it may be two hundred millions—of men who dwell and
prosper on that Continent which the grand old Genoese gave to Europe.”
Happier far than ancient Rome, Great Britain is not the —
“ Lone Mother of Dead Empires.”
She is, in Bright’s eloquent words, the living mother of great nations
on the American and on the Australian Continents, which promise to
endow the world with all her knowledge and all her civilisation, and
with even something more than the freedom she herself enjoys.
The English statesman may view not grudgingly the expansion
of local industries in the several colonies of the Empire. He may do
more. He may in no jealous spirit admire the industrial development
in Germany and the artistic production of France, believing that upon
every consideration of what is truly conducive to the well-being of
British Industry and Foreign Competition.


the people of the United Kingdom, it is not to be desired that they
should bear upon their shoulders an ever-increasing burden of labour
for other nations.
This is not the first occasion on which I have endeavoured to
present a cheerful picture for the consideration of those who incline
to pessimistic views. Again and again I have returned to the subject.
Every examination and re-examination of the situation has shown
that the United Kingdom has no monopoly of trade, that the advan-
tage gained from an earlier start in the race tells less in our favour
than formerly. Other countries are pressing us more closely. It can
hardly be alleged that they are leaving us behind.
In conclusion, let us consider the vast foreign trade of the United
Kingdom in its political aspect. We are living in anxious and difficult
times. We are daily witnesses of events of momentous import. At
such a time the statesman may well be thankful that there is an
interchange of trade on a vast scale between the United Kingdom
and foreign countries. It has supplied the means of living to teeming
millions of the British people. It is perhaps the surest guarantee that
we possess that peace will be preserved.

British Industry and Foreign Competition.


-<dX Appendix. KcS*
From “The Age,” October 31. 1896.
In Lord Brassey’s very dexterously handled and very interesting address to
the Chamber of Commerce he definitely gives up the Cobdenic dream of making
England the “ workshop of the world.” His Excellency cherishes all an English-
man’s natural pride at the commanding position of his country in industry,
commerce and ships, and refuses to believe that that supremacy is even so much
as challenged. Yet he frankly admits that the British nation must look to
Germany “as a really formidable competitor.” Indeed, he goes a little further
than this, and supplies a table which he says “ shows the marked progress of
Germany between 1886 and 1892.” Out of the facts before him Lord Brassey
concludes that there are three specially great industrial nations in the world—the
United Kingdom, the United States and Germany. Of these he proceeds to
prove that Great Britain stands conspicuously foremost. His Excellency says:
“ In 1895, with a population of 37,750,000, the exports of British produce were
£226,169,174. In 1894, with a population of 49,428,000, the exports of Germany
were £148,880,000. In 1895, with a population of 63,000,000, the exports of the
United States aggregated £165,280,206.” Now, this may be all true enough, but
it is judging the industrial development of nations, not by their productiveness in
actual wealth, but by the volume of foreign trade they carry on. America and
Germany are both of them protectionist nations; and the primary idea of a
protectionist nation is not to become either the world’s carrier or workshop, but to be
as nearly self-supporting as is compatible with soil and climate. Now, the total
foreign trade of the United States in 1892 did not amount to more than
£6 13s. gd. per head; that of Germany was £8 9s. 4b.; that of the United
Kingdom was £2O 10s. But then the foreign trade of Belgium was £4l 13s.
According to the export trade standard of gauging national growth, Belgium has
twice the relative development that England has, while the United Stales have
less than one-sixth the relative industry that Belgium has. Yet we know the
value of the manufactures of the United States reached nearly £1,200,000,000 six
years ago, while those of the United Kingdom were only about £800,000,000.
Besides, under what Mr. De Lissa has worked out as “ the law of incomes,” we
have learned that the production of wealth can be almost mathematically gauged
by the ascertained average incomes of a people. Measured by this test, each
20

unit of the seventy millions in the United States earns a larger income than his
English congener, and produces a correspondingly larger amount of wealth every
year. These facts show that mere exports and imports are a fallacious measure
to apply to the industrial productivity of a nation.
Lord Brassey’s tables of trade certainly show that during the year 1895 and
the first half of the present year there has been a revival in British trade. But
then no one has disputed that; and none of his figures seem to us to really
touch the facts set forth in Mr. William’s book, “ Made in Germany.” In truth
he expressly admits that while the total value, not volume, of German exports
has been for some years on the descending scale, the value and volume too of
German manufactures sent to England are increasing. His comparative tables
show us also that while the decline of German exports from 1890 to 1894 was
less than £18,000,000, the decline of British trade in the same year was
£48,000,000. The Textile Mercury of 15th August says that Germany is making
vast strides in the woollen trade. The number of her spindles has increased from
1,669,759 in 1861 to 3,600,000 in 1896, and this is but one fact amongst many that
confirm the figures quoted in “ Made in Germany.” At any rate, after making
such inevitable admissions as he does, it seems a little hazardous to characterise
the salient facts in “ Made in Germany ” as groundless. His Excellency speaks
of the German sugar industry as “an artificial trade created and maintained by
a lavish bounty.” There are very few trades or industries, of course, that are
not artificial, in the sense that they have to be created and built up, more often
by private enterprise, but occasionally at the expense of the public in the form of
a State subsidy. What the German bounty fed sugar is doing is to kill another
flourishing British industry. An article in the October number of the New Review
says: “Sugar refining was at one time a staple in divers parts of the United
Kingdom. To-day the trade is but a memory in many towns which once were
centres, and the poor atomy of itself in the few places where it still remains
afoot. The world in general, and England in particular, consume more sugar
than ever; but the foreigner has cleared us out of the market. ... A generation
ago there were 28 sugar factories in East London; there are now but two. . . . Bristol,
famous for loaf sugar a generation since, does not now turn out a pound of any
kind.” That has meant a loss of more than £1,000,000 a year to English
industry, to say nothing of the additional loss to the country generally by having
to send that amount out of it to purchase the article in a foreign market.
Commenting on the German bounties, the reviewer says: “ Foreign States do
not leave their industries to look after themselves or perish in the attempt.”
The one sole reply which has been attempted by free-traders to this latest
destruction of British industry is that England gets cheap sugar at German
expense. But that is a delusion. The fractional benefit to the consumer which
has shut up the English sugar refineries is not an appreciable compensation for
the loss to the wage fund which arises from the extinction of a valuable industry.
Nor does that end the matter. The sugar from German beet is checking the
West Indian plantations, and if it should eventuate that the continental sugar
growers gain a monopoly of the British markets, their prices will assume the form
common to all partial or complete monopolies. The bounty-fed sugar industry is
21
British Industry and Foreign Competition.


a very valuable business to Germany, but it entails a more than corresponding
loss to the United Kingdom.
If this is true, Lord Brassey’s note of jubilation that Great Britain “is still
the first of the nations in industry and commerce ” has to be toned down into a
minor key. The most comprehensive test of the wealth of a country is the
average incomes of its population since all the agents of human industry have
been working to produce them; and the average English incomes are much
smaller than those in the United States or in Australasia. If free-trade Great
Britain produces wealth worth £1,247,000,000, protectionist United States produces
more than £2,600,000,000. In foreign trade Great Britain is easily first, as she is
in the possession of a mercantile marine, but the mere carriers of wealth are not
the owners of it, otherwise the railway porter would be a millionaire. And if it
be true, as Lord Brassey says, that England earns £73,000,000 a year by her
shipping trade, or 55.2 per cent, of the world’s total, that is but a small
consolation for the loss of an agriculture worth £670,000,000. Nor is that
shipping trade secure. The system of German subventions to steam shipping
companies is bringing about a serious menace to it. For instance, it is stated
that the P. and O. Company charge only 10s. per ton for carrying iron from
Antwerp to Bombay via London, whilst iron shipped direct from London pays
15s. 6d. per ton. The result has been that English merchants have lately
largely adopted the system of shipping their goods via the Continent, the round-
about method being found cheaper than shipping direct from an English port.
The St. James's Gazette says : “ The British shipping industry is engaged in the
carrying trade of the world, and the attack made upon it will not be felt by
itself alone, but must injure British commerce to a vital extent, for when the
shipping trade is paralysed freight will be in foreign hands, and would be capable
of being raised to any extent. ... At present the shipping bounties are being
used to reduce English freights, and to force foreign goods upon the English
consumer to the displacement of our home productions.”
His Excellency strikes a proud national note that will find an echo in every
British heart when he says : “ Marvellous indeed must have been the commercial
and maritime enterprise; marvellous the industrial aptitude of that people who,
living under gloomy skies in a small island, in area scarcely a 400th part of the
habitable globe, and drawing the raw materials for their work mainly from distant
countries, have yet made themselves to so large an extent the manufacturers for
the whole world.” But he is evidently conscious of the heavy penalty which has
been paid for that great accomplishment. Nothing, he says, is less to be desired
than that England should become the world’s workshop. All men of sober
judgment —that is, all men who are not still awaiting the arrival of the
millennium which was predicted with such disappointing results by the prophet
Cobden forty years ago —will heartily agree with him. When Lord Brassey turns
his thoughts to the “ Black country ” which has burnt up so many of the “ green
lanes of England,” where not a tree remains unwithered, and scarcely a grass
blade survives, he would not have another factory established in Lancashire. “It
is not to be desired,” he concludes, “ that the people of the United Kingdom
should bear upon their shoulders an ever increasing burden of labour for other
nations.” So says every friend of Humanity, as well as every Englishman.

British Industry and Foreign Competition.


From “The Argus,” October 31, 1896.
The “Made in Germany” controversy has an interest of its own. Strangely
■enough the subject is far more heard of in Victoria than in Great Britain, where,
after a short discussion, its value has been fairly assessed. But here the argu-
ments have been pressed into partisan service. We are told that Great Britain
sees her doom before her. She is being crushed out of existence, it is alleged,
because she allows German goods to enter her markets. And the argument
proceeds, that to save Victoria from ruin we ought to sternly and absolutely keep
British goods and German goods out of the markets of Victoria, and if we do not
rigorously exclude these and other commodities, why, the terrible calamity which
has befallen Great Britain will equally afflict our poor selves. Now, has any
calamity really happened to Great Britain ? Is the prosperity of the mother
country in any way impaired through her admission of German goods ? Can
Macaulay’s famous New Zealander prepare to pack up for London with the
intention of sketching the ruins of St. Paul’s from a broken arch of London
Bridge ? Ought we to recall the agent whom our frozen meat companies are
sending to England, realising that it is foolish to push trade with a decadent and
dying community? Happily, this question of whether German commerce is killing
the commerce of Great Britain is not a matter of opinion, but is one of facts
and figures. Were the issue one of party opinion merely, no doubt His Excellency
the Governor would hesitate before taking part in the discussion. But it is not.
His Excellency is singularly active in mind. He is a recognised authority in the
Empire in cases where industrial data are concerned; and anxious as he is, as an
Imperial officer, that the true position of the Empire shall be known, he very
properly, in a judicial spirit, sets the fafts before the people of Victoria. His
remarks in another part of this issue will well repay perusal. They will make
the reader prouder of our great Empire than ever, and more than ever confident
that a grand past is likely to be followed by a grander future.
His Excellency shows from the fafts of the case that the “Made in Germany”
statements are not justifiable. Germany is much the best customer of Great
Britain on the Continent. And the trade is on the increase. In 1895 Great
Britain exported goods to Germany to the value of £3,000,000 over and above
what she exported in 1894, and Germany did not increase her exports to Great
Britain by more than £300,000. After giving the figures fully, His Excellency
says: “In so far as relative efficiency in great industries can be measured
by the interchange of trade, no symptoms are visible of decay in the United
Kingdom. Germany, as it has already been said, is by far the most formidable
of our rivals in trade. But we have not been unable to hold our own. Our
exports to that great industrial country, consisting mainly of manufactures, show
a sustained and rapid growth. Our imports from Germany are not increasing in
an equal ratio, and they consist mainly of food and raw material.” His
Excellency endorses the dictum that with regard to the “Made in Germany” cry
the boot, to use the homely phrase, is on the other leg. There would be more
force if in Germany a cry were raised about “ Made in England.”

There are but one set of official figures available if we wish to compare the
export trade of Great Britain and of Germany, and His Excellency quotes them
as follows. The return is per head of the population :
1885-9.
1890-4.
£ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d.
United Kingdom 6 13 2 63-8 6 2 11
Germany 388 356 329
These figures, which were rudely assailed when they were given in the Argus
before, do indeed simply and effectually dispose of the issue. Lord Brassey also
gives the wealth production of each of the great countries of the world: —
Wealth Production Per Annum.
Great Britain, with the smallest population and with shorter hours of labour.
produces the most wealth. “ Marvellous indeed,” says His Excellency, “is the
commercial and maritime enterprise; marvellous the industrial aptitude of that
people, who, living under gloomy skies in a small island, in area scarcely a four-
hundredth part of the habitable globe, and drawing the raw materials for their
work mainly from distant countries, have yet made themselves to so large an
extent the manufacturers for the whole world.” Great Britain has no monopoly,
of course. Other nations are working hard, and they will possibly recover lost
ground, occupying all that they are legitimately entitled to. But, says Lord
Brassey, this does not mean the decadence of Great Britain. Liverpool can
grow without London falling back. The foreign trade of Great Britain is
advancing by leaps and bounds. “We are the first of the nations in industry
and commerce.”
It is an interesting question whether it is desirable that England should
become more of a workshop for the world than she is to-day, and one to be
considered on another occasion. From the patriotic standpoint His Excellency is
to be thanked for his vindication of the British position. We have in Victoria
far too much of a policy of malicious belittlement of the mother country. Even
if the aspersions of Great Britain were original that would be something, but they
are not. They are melancholy reproductions of the abuse common in America,
where the one party assails Great Britain as a tyrannical rich country, using
bayonets and fleets to extort a tribute in gold from the world, while the other
party describes her as an impoverished and starving community, employing bribed
agents, and forcing upon other countries the products of her pauper labour.
This can be smiled at as coming from America. But when we see Australian
feathers upon the poisoned shafts, loyal subjedts and honest men cannot but feel
a pang.
