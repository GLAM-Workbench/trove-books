COME O’ER THE STREAM, CHARLIE.
Air— 11 Maclean’s Welcome.” _ Words by James Hogg.
Come o’er the stream, Charlie, dear Charlie, brave Charlie,
Come o’er the stream, Charlie, and dine wi’ MacEean ;
And though you be weary, we’ll make your heart cheery,
And welcome our Cliarlie and his loyal train.
We’ll bring down the red deer, we’ll bring down the black steer
The lamb from the breckan, and doe from the glen ;
The salt sea we’ll harry, and bring to our Charlie
The cream from the bothy, and curd from the pen.
And you shall drink freely the dews of Glen-Sheerly
That stream in the star-light, when kings dinna ken
And deep be your meed of the wine that is red,
To drink to your sire and his friend the MacEean.
If aught will invite you, or more will delight you,
’Tis ready—a troop of our bold Highland men
Shall range on the heather, with bonnet and feather,
Strong arms and broad claymores, three hundred and ten.
[l] Reach. f2] Big pot. [3] To shed tears.
Sae true his heart, sae smooth his speech,
His breath like caller air ;
His very fit has music iu’t
As he comes up the stair.
And will I see his face again ?
And will I hear him speak ?
I’m downright dizzi'e wr the thought,
In troth I’m like to greet. [3]

COME UNDER MY PLAIDIE.
Words by Hector Macneil.
“ Come under my plaidie, the night’s gaun to fa’;
Come in frae the cauld blast, the drift, and the snaw ;
Come under my plaidie, and sit down beside me,
There’s room in’t, dear lassie, believe me, for twa.
Come under my plaidie, and sit down beside me,
I’ll hap [l] ye frae ev’ry cauld blast that can blaw;
0 come under my plaidie, and sit down beside me,
There’s room in’t, dear lassie, believe me, for twa.”
“ Gae ’wa wi’ yer plaidie ! auld Donald, gae ’wa :
I fear nae the cauld blast, the drift, nor the snaw ;
Gae ’wa wi’ yer plaidie ! I’ll no sit beside ye ;
Ye raicht be my gutcher ! [2] auld Donald, gae ’wa.
I’m gaun to meet Johnnie —he’s young and he’s bonnie ;
He’s been at Meg’s bridal, fu’ trig [3] and fu’ braw !
Nane dances sae lichtly, sae gracefu’, sae tichtly,
His cheek’s like the new rose, his brow’s like the snaw.”
“ Dear Marion, let that flee [4] stick fast to the wa’;
Your Jock’s but a gowk, [s] and has naething ava;
The hale [6] o’ his pack he has now on his back ;
He’s thretty, and I am but threescore and twa.
Be frank now and kindly—l’ll busk ye aye finely ;
To kirk or to market there’ll nane gang sae braw ;
A bien [7] house to bide in, a chaise for to ride in,
An’ flunkies [B] to ’tend ye as aft as ye ca’.”
“ My faither aye tauld me, my mither an’ a’;
Ye’d mak’ a gude husband, and keep me aye braw ;
It’s true I lo’e Johnnie, he’s young and he 5 s bonnie,
But, wae’s me ! I ken, he has naething ava !
I ha’e little tocher ; [9] ye’ve made a gude offer ;
I’m now mair than twenty ; my time is but sma’;
Sae gi’e me your plaidie, I’ll creep in beside ye,
I thocht ye’d been aulder than threescore and twa !”
She crap [lo] in ayont him, beside the stand wa’,
Whar Johnnie was list’nin’ and heard her tell a’;
The day was appointed ! —lds proud heart it dunted, [II]
And strack ’gainst his side as if bursting in twa.
He wander’d hame wearie, the nicht it was drearie,
And, thowless, [l2] he tint his gate [l3] ’mang the deep snaw ;
The howlet [l4] was screamin’, while Johnnie cried, “ Women
Wad marry auld Nick, if he’d keep them aye braw.’’

THE LAIRD O’ COCKPEN.
Air —" When she cam’ ben she hobbit.’’
The Laird o’ Cockpen, he’s proud and he’s
great;
His mind is ta’en up wi’ affairs o’ the state;
He wanted a wife his braw house to keep;
But favour wi’ wooin’ was fashions to seek.
Down by the dyke-side a lady did dwell,
At his table-head he thought she’d look
well;
M’Clish’s ae daughter o’ Claverse-ha’ Lee,
A pennyless lass' wi’ a lang pedigree.
His wig was weel pouther’d, as guid as
when new,
His waistcoat was white, his coat it was
blue;
He put on a ring, a sword, and cock’d
hat, —
And wha could refuse the Laiid wi’ a’ that ?
Words by Lady Nairne.
She’s wanted to speak wi’ the Laird o’
Cockpen.”
Mistress Jean she was makin’ the elder-
flower wine;
“And what brings the Laird at sic a
like time ?”
She put aff her apron, and on her silk gown,
Her mutch wi’ red ribbons, and gaed awa’
down.
And when she cam ben, he bowed fu’ low;
And what was his errand he soon let her
know;
Amazed was the Laird when the lady said,
“ Na,”
And wi’ a laigh curtsey she turned away.
Dumfounded he stood, but nae sigh did he
gie;
He mounted his mare, and he rode can-
nilie ;
But aften he thought as he gaed through
the glen,
“ Sh«’s daft to refuse the Laird o’ Cockpen,*,
He took the gray mare and rade cannilie,
And rapped at the yett o’ Claverse-ha’ Lee;
“ Gae tell Mistress Jean to come speedily


GET UP AN’
BAR
It fell about the Martinmas time,
And a gay time it was then, O,
When our gudewife had puddin’s to mak’,
And she boil’d them in the pan, 0.
The wind blew cauld frae north to south,
It blew into the floor, 0 ;
Says our gudeman to our gudewife,
“ Get up and bar the door, 0.”
“ My hand is in my hussyfeskep, [l]
Gudeman, as ye may see, 0 ;
And it shouldna be barr’d this hunner year,
It’s no be barr’d for me, 0.”
They made a paction ’tween them twa,
They made it firm and sure, 0,
The ane that spak the foremost word
Should rise and bar the door, 0.
Then by there cam’ twa gentlemen,
At twelve o’clock at nicht, O ;
And they could neither see house nor ha’,
Nor coal nor candle licht, 0.
O, they were hungry, cauld, and wet,
For ’twas an awfir nicht, 0,
When yonder stood an open door,
Their hearts lap at the sicht, 0 !
THE DOOR, 0.
“ Now whether is this a rich man’s house.
Or whether is this a puir, 0 I ”
But never a word aue o’ them spak,
For the barrin’ o’ the door, 0.
And first they ate the white puddin’s,
And then they ate the black, 0 ;
And muckle thought the gudewife to hersel’
But never a word she spak, 0.
Then said the tane unto the tither.
“ Here, man, tak ye my knife, (),
Do ye tak aff the auld man’s beard,
And I’ll kiss the gudewife, 0.”
“ But there’s nae water in the house,
And what shall we do then, 0 \ ”
“ What ails ye at the puddin’ bree [2],
That boils into the pan, 0.”
0, up then startit our gudeman,
And an angry man was he, 0 :
“ Wad ye kiss my wife before my face.
And scald me wi’ puddin’ bree, 0 I ”
Then up startit our gudewife,
Gi’ed three skips on the floor, O ;
“ Gudeman, ye’ve spoken the foremost word,
Get up and bar the door, 0.”

JENNY DANG
THE WEAVER
Music by Rev. Mr. Gardner.
Words by Sir Alexander Boswell.
Jock slippit close to Jenny’s side,
And cockit up his beaver ;
Sae fu’ o’ self-conceit and pride,
He thocht she’d tak’ a weaver.
At Willie’s wedding on the green,
The lasses —bonnie witches —
Were a’ dressed out in aprons clean,
And braw white Sunday mutches; [3]
Auld Maggie bade the lads tak’ tent, [4]
But Jock would no believe her;
But soon the fool his folly kent,
For Jenny dang the weaver.
And Jenny dang, Jenny dang,
Jenny dang the weaver;
But soon the fool his folly kent,
For Jenny dang the weaver.
And Jenny dang, &c.
Quo’ he, “ My lass, to speak my mind,
In truth I needna swither; [6]
You’ve bonnie e’en, and if you’re kind
I’ll never seek anither.”
He humra’d and haw’d, the lass cried,
“ Peugh ! ”
And bade the coof no deave her ;
Syne snapt her fingers, lap and leugh,
And dang the silly weaver.
At ilka country dance or reel
Wi’ her he would be babbin’;
When she sat down he sat down,
And to her would be- gabbin’;
Where’er she gaed, baith but and ben,
The coof would never leave her,
Aye kecklin’ like a clockin’ hen ; [SJ
But Jenny dang the weaver.
And Jenny dang, &c.
As Jockey stood maist like to greet,
Auld Maggie cam’ to cheer him—
“ Gae kiss, and clap, and ca’ her sweet, —
Ye’ll get her, never fear, man.”
“ Na, na,” quo’Jock, “ I’m aff wi’ love—
My mither, I’ll ne’er leave her ;
My heart’s a stane nae lass can move,
I’ll dee a single weaver.”
And Jenny dang, &c.
The lads and lasses round about
At Jockey they were jeerin’;
“ Lauch on,” said he, “ye’ll soon find sut
I’ll get her for the speerin’.”
And Jenny dang, &c.

I’ve been by burn and flow’ -ry brae, Meadow green and mountain grey,
Cour - tin’ o’ this young thing,

And whar gat ye that young thing,

I got her down in yonder howe,
Smiling on a brooraie knowe,
Herding ae wee lamb and ewe,
For her puir mammy.
What said ye to the bonnie baim,
My boy Tammy 1
I praised her e’en, sae bonnie blue,
Her dimpled cheek and cherry mou’ :
I pree’d [l] it aft, as ye may trow ! [2]
She said she’d tell her mammy.
I clasped her to my beating heart,
My young, my smiling lammie 1
I ha’e a house, it cost me dear,
I’ve walth [3] o’ plenisHin’ and gear;
Ye’se [4] get it a’, were’t ten times mair.
Gin [s] ye will leave your mammy.
The smile gaed aff her bonnie face—
I mauuna leave my mammy i
She’s gi’en me meat, slie's gi’en me clacs,[6}
She’s been my comfort a' my days ;
My faither’s death brought mony waes [7].
I canna leave ray mammy.
We’ll tak’ her hame and mak’ her fain,
My am kind-hearted lammie.
We’ll gi’e her meat, we ’ll gi’e her claes,
We’ll be her comfort a’ her days.
The wee thing gi’es her hand, and says—
There ! gang and ask my mammy.
Has she been to the kirk wi’ thee,
Music by E. Land.
My boy Tammy I
She has been to the kirk wi’ me,
And the tear was in her e’e ;
For 0 ! she’s but a young thing,
Just come frae her mammy.

Low in the heather-blooms,
Sweet will thy welcome and bed of love be!

Music by J. F. Leeson.
0 sing to me the auld Scots sangs
I’ the braid Scottish tongue,
The sangs ray faither wished to hear.
The sangs my mither sung,
When sire sat beside my cradle,
Or croon’d [l] me on her knee ;
An’ I wadna sleep, she sang sae sweet
The auld Scots sangs to me.
Sing ony o’ the auld Scots sangs,
The blithesome or the sad,
They mak me smile when I am wae,
And greet when I am glad ;
Words by Rev. Dr. Bethune.
My heart gaes back to auld Scotland,
The saut tear dims my e’e,
And the Scots blood leaps in a’ my veins,
As ye sing time sangs to me.
Sing on, sing mair o’ time auld sangs,
For ilka ane can tell
O’ joy or sorrow o’ the past,
Where mem’ry loves to dwell;
Tho’ hair grow grey, and limbs grow auld,
Until the day I dee
I’ll bless the Scottish tongue that sings ,
The auld Scots sangs to me.

LAST MAY A DRAW WOOER
Air —" The Lothian Lassie.”
Words by Burns.
Last May a braw wooer cam’ down the lang glen,
And sair wi’ his love he did deave [l] me ;
I said there was naething 1 hated like men,
The deuce gae wi’ him to believe me, believe me
The deuce gae wi’ liim, to believe me.
He spak’ the darts o’ my bonnie black e’en,
And vow’d for my love he was deein’;
I said he micht dee when he liked for Jean,
The guid forgi’e me for leein’, for leein’,
The guid forgi’e me for leein’.
A weel stockit mailin’, [2] himself o’t the laird,
And marriage aff hand,‘was his proffer ;
I never loot on that 1 kenn’d it or cared,
But thocht I micht ha’e a waur [3] offer, waur offer.
But thocht I micht ha’e a waur offer.
But what do you think I in a fortnight or less,
The de’il’s in his taste to gang near her ;
He’s up the Gateslack to my black cousin Bess,
Guess ye how, the jaud, 1 could bear her, could bear her,
Guess ye how, the jaud, I could bear her.
But a’ the next week, as I fretted wi’ care,
I gaed to the tryst o’ Dalgarnock ;
And wha but my braw fickle wooer was there ?
Wha glower’d [4] as if he’d seen a warlock, [s] a warlock,
Wha glower’d as if he’d seen a warlock.
Out owre my left shouther I gi’ed him a blink, [6]
Lest neighbours micht say 1 was saucy ;
My wooer he caper’d as he’d been in drink,
And.vow’d that I was his dear lassie, dear lassie,
And vow’d that I was his dear lassie.
I spier’d [7} for my cousin, fuf couthie [B] and sweet,
Gin she had recover’d her hearin’ ;
And how my auld shoon fitted her shauchled [9] feet,
Guid save us, how he fell a |swearin’, a swearin’,
Guid save us, how he fell a swearin’.
He begged for guid-sake I wad be his wife,
Or else I wad kill him wi’ sorrow ;
Sae, e’en to preserve the puir body in life,
I think I maun wed him touaurrow, to-morrow,
1 think I maun wed him itomiorrow.

WAE’S ME FOR PRINCE CHARLIE.

A wee bird cam’ to our ha’ door, He war - bled sweet and
clear - ly, An’ aye the o’er - come [l] o’ his sang Was
bon - nie, bon - nie bird, The tears cam’ drap - pin’ rare -ly ;
took my ban - net aff my head, For weel I lo’ed Prince Char- lie.
Quoth I, “ My bird, my bonnie bonnie bird,
Is that a tale ye borrow,
Or is’t some words ye’ve learnt by rote,
Or a lilt [2] o’ dool [3] an’ sorrow ?”
“ Oh! no, no, no,” the wee bird sang,
“ I’ve down sin’ mornin’ early,
But sic a day o’ wind and rain—
-0 ! wae’s me for Prince Charlie ! ”
THE WEE, WEE
Wha the deil hae we gotten for a king,
But a w T ee, wee German Lairdie ;
When they gaed ower to bring him hame,
He w r as delvin his kail-yairdie.
He was sheughing kail, [4] and laying leeks,
Without the hose, and but the breeks,
And up his beggar duds he cleeks, [s]
This wee, wee German Lairdie.
And he’s clappit down in our gudeman’s
chair,
The wee, wee German Lairdie ;
And he’s brought fouth o’ his foreign trash.
And dibbled [6] them in his yairdie.
He’s pu’d the rose o’ English loons,
And broken the harp o’ Irish clowns ;
But our Scotch thistle will jag his thumbs,
This wee, wee German Lairdie.
But now the bird saw some red coats,
An’ he shook his wings wi’ anger,
“ Oh! this is no a land for me,
I’ll tarry here nae langer.”
Awhile he hovered on the wing
Ere he departed fairly.
But weel I mind the fareweel strain
Was “ Wae’s me for Prince Charlie !”
GERMAN LAIRDIE.

Come up amang our Hieland hills,
Thou wee, w r ee German Lairdie,
And see the Stuart’s laug kail thrive,
They hae dibbled in our kail-yairdie.
And if a stock ye daur to pu’,
Or hand the yokin’ o’ a plough.
We’ll break your sceptre ower your mou’,
Ye wee, wee German Lair die.
Auld Scotland, thou’rt ower cauld a hole,
For nursin’ siccan vermin ;
But the very dogs in England’s court,
They bark and howl in German.
Then keep thy dibble in thy ain hand,
Thy spade but and thy yairdie ;
For wha the deil hae we gotten for a
king,
But a wee, wee German Lairdie.

“ Loudon’s bonnie woods and braes,

Wha can thole when Britain’s foes
Wad gie to Britons law lassie ?

Wha to fame wad live a stranger ?

WHa wad shun her ca’, lassie ?

Then gather, gather, gather!

For I left them a’ i’ the morning.
Hey, Johnnie Cope, &c.

And leave your men in sic a strait,

Words by Ta.nna.hill,
Still the weary moments countin’,
Far frae love and thee, laddie.
Ower the gory fields o’ war,
Where vengeance drives his crimson car,
Thou may fa’ frae me afar,
And nane to close thy e’e, laddie.”
“ Oh, resume thy wonted smile ;
Oh, suppress thy fears, lassie—
Glorious honour crowns the toil
That the soldier shares, lassie.
Heaven will shield thy faithful lover
Till the vengeful strife is over,
Then we’ll meet nae mair to sever
Till the day we dee, lassie.
’Midst our bonnie woods and braes
We’ll spend our peacefu’, happy days,
As blythe’s yon lichtsome lamb that plays
On Loudon’s flowery lea, lassie.”
GATHERING.
Words by Waiter Scott.
Macgregor, despite them, shall flourish for
ever!
Glen Orchy’s proud mountains, Colchuirn
and her towers,
Glenstrae andGlenlyon no longer are ours—
We’re landless, landless, landless,
Grigalach!
Landless, landless, landless!
Through the depths of Loch Katrine the
steed shall career,
O’er the peak of Ben Lomond the galley
shall steer;
And the rocks of Crag Royston like icicles
melt
Ere our wrongs be forgot or our vengeance
unfelt, Then haloo, &c.
If they rob us, &c.

Air—" Lesley’s March.”
Words by Walter Scott,
March, march, Ettrick and Teviotdale,
Why, my lads, dinna ye march forward
in order ?
March, march, Eskdale and Liddesdale,
All the blue bonnets are over the border.
Come from the glen of the buck and the
roe:
Come to the crag where the beacon is
blazing;
Come with the buckler, the lance, and
Many a banner spread flutters above your
head,
Many a crest that is famous in story:
Mount and make ready then, sons of the
mountain glen,
Fight for your Queen and the old Scot-
tish glory.
Come from the hills where your hirsels are
the bow.
Trumpets are sounding, war-steeds are
bounding;
Stand to your arms, and march in good
order;
England shall many a day tell of the bloodj
fray
When the blue bonnets came over the
grazing,
border.

Cam’ seeking me to woo.
An’ wow ! but he was a bonnie young lad,
A brisk young lad and a braw young lad,
An’ wow! but he was a bonnie young lad,
Cam’ seeking me to woo.
But I was baking when he came,.
When he came, when he came,
I took him in, and gied him a scone,
To thowe his frozen mou’.
An’ wow ! but he was, &c.

JENNY’S
I met four chaps yon birks amang,
Wi’ hinging lugs and faces lang:
I spier’d at neighbour Bauldy Strang,
Wha’s they I see ?
Quo’ he, “ Ilk cream-faced pawky duel
Thocht he was cunning as the deil,
And here they cam’ awa’ to steal
Jenny’s bawbee.”
The first, a Captain to his trade,
Wi’ skull ill lined, but back well clad,
March’d round the bam, and by the shed,
And pappit on his knee ;
Quo’ he, “ My goddess, nymph, and queen,
Your beauty’s dazzled baith my e’en !”
But feint a beauty he had seen
But —J enny’s bawbee.
A lawyer neist, wi’ bletherin’ gab,
Wha speeches wove like ony wab,
In ilk ane’s corn aye took a dab,
And a’ for a fee.
Accounts he owed through a’ the toun,
And tradesmen’s tongues nae mair could
drown,
But now he thocht to clout his gown
Wi’ Jenny’s bawbee.
A Norland Laird neist trotted up,
Wi’ bawsand naig [4] and siller whup,
Cried, “ There’s my horse, lad, baud the

An’ wow ! but he was, &c.
There lay a deuk-dub [3] before the door,
Before the door, before the door ;
There lay a deuk-dub before the door,
An’ there fell he, I trow!

An’ a’ the toim-neebors were gather’d

But she preen’d the dishclout to his tail,
And soused him wi’ the water-pail,
Then Johnnie cam’, a lad o’ sense,
Although he had na mony pence ;
And took young Jenny to the spence, [7]

Fareweel! fareweel! ray native harae !
Thy lonely glens and heath-clad moun-
tains ;
Fareweel, thy fields o’ storied fame,
Thy leafy shaws and sparkling fountains ;
Nae mair I’ll climb the Pentland sleep,
Nor wander by the Esk’s clear river ;
I seek a hame far o’er the deep,
My native land, fareweel for ever.
Words and Music by Alexander Hume.
Though far frae thee, my native shore,
And tossed on life’s tempestuous ocean,
My heart, aye Scottish to the core,
Shall chug to thee wi’ warm devotion ;
And while the wavin’ heather grows,
And onward rolls the windin’ river ;
The toast be “ Scotland’s broomy knowes.
Her mountains, rocks, and glens for
ever.”

Oil his grey mare, as he did ride,
Wi’ dirk and pistol by his side,
He prick’d her on w r i’ mickle pride,
Wi’ mickle mirth and glee.

SAW YE MY WEE THING?
Words by Heoior Macnell.
“ Saw ye my wee thing, saw ye my ain thing 2
Saw ye my true love down on yon lea I
Crossed she the meadow yestreen at the gloamin’ 2
Sought she the burnie [l] where tlow’rs the haw tree 2
Her hair it is lint-white, her skin it is milk-white,
Dark is the blue o’ her saft rollin’ e’e,
lied, red her ripe lips, and sweeter than roses ;
Where could my wee thing wander frae me 2 ”
“J saw na your wee thing, I saw na your ain thing,
Nor saw I your true love down on yon lea ;
But I met my bonnie thing late in the gleamin’,
Down by the burnie where tlow’rs the haw tree.
Her hair it is lint-white, her skin it is milk-white,
Dark was the blue o’ her saft rollin’ e’e,
Red were her ripe lips, and sweeter than roses,
Sweet were the kisses that she ga’e to me.”
“ It was na my wee thing, it was na my ain thing,
It was na my true love ye met by the tree ;
Proud is her leal [2] heart, and modest her nature ;
She never lo’ed ony till a nee she lo’ed me.
Her name it is Mary, she’s frae Castlecary,
Oft has she sat when a bairn on my knee ;
Fair as your face is, wer’t fifty times fairer,
Young braggart, she ne’er would gie kisses to thee.”
“ It was then your Mary—she’s frae Castlecary,
It was then your true love I met by the tree;
Proud as her heart is, and modest her nature,
Sweet were the kisses that she ga’e to me.”
Bair gloomed his dark brow, blood-red his cheek grew,
Wild flashed the fire frae his dark rollin’ e’e ;
“ Ye’s rue sair this morning your boast and your scorning—
Defend thou, fause traitor, fu’ loudly ye lee.”
“ Awa’ wi’ beguilin’,” cried the youth smilin’;
Aff went the bonnet, the lint-white locks flee,
The belted plaid fa’in, her white bosom shawin’,
There stood the loved maid wi’ the dark rolling e’e.
Is it my wee thing ? is it my ain thing I
Is it my true love here that I see 2 ”
“ 0 Jamie, forgie me, your heart’s constant to me,
I’ll never mair wander, dear laddie, frae thee.”

Oh ! rowan tree, oh ! rowan tree, [3] thou’lt aye be dear to me ;

Thy leaves were aye the first o’ spring, thy flow’rs the simmer’s pride ;
There was na sic a bonnie tree in a’ the country side. Oh ! rowan tree.
We sat aneath thy spreading shade, the bairnies round thee ran,
They pu’d thy bonnie berries red, and necklaces they strung ;
My mither, oh ! I see her still, she smiled our sports to see,
Wi’ little Jeanie on her lap, and Jamie at her knee. Oh ! rowan tree.
Oli ! there arose my father’s prayer in holy ev’ning’s calm,
How sweet was then my mother’s voice, singing the Martyr’s psalm!
Now a’ are gane! we meet nae mair aneath the rowan tree,
But hallowed thoughts around thee twine o’ hame and infancy.
Oh ! rowan tree.

1 can heedless look on the siller sea,
1 may tentless muse on the tiow’ry lea;
But my heart wi’ a nameless rapture thrills
When I gaze on the cliffs o’ my heather
hills.
Then hurrah, hurrah, for tny heather
hills,
Where the bonnie thistle waves to the
sweet blue bells,
And the wild mountain floods heave
their crests to the clouds,
Syne foam down the steeps o’ my heather
hills.
Words by John Ballantine.

I hae berried the nest o’ the wild muircock,
I hae clamber’d the steeps o’ the raven’s

I hae courted my love in their rocky fells*
And w’on a sweet bride on my heather hills.
Then hurrah, &c.
I cling to their braes like the bud to the
thorn,
For ’mang their heather knowlets sae free
was 1 born;
And the hame o’ my youth is my lov’d
hame still,
’Neath the kindly shade o’ a heather hill.
And when nature fails, row’d in my plaid,
I’ll lay me down on a heather bed;
! And patiently wait till kind heavenwills
O ! aft in my roving youthfu’ days, To w T aft me awa’ frae my heather hills.
I’venestled and row’d on their sunny braes ; --j. Then hurrah, &c.
SAE WILL WE YET.
Words by W. Watson.
Sit ye down here, my cronies, and gi’e us your crack, [2]
Let "the wind take the care o’ this life on its back ;
Our hearts to despondency we ne’er will submit,
For we’ve aye been provided for, and sae will we yet.
And sae will we yet, &c.
The miser delights in the hoardin’ o’ his pelf,
He has not the soul to enjoy it himself;
The bounties o’ providence are new every day,
As we journey thro’ life, let us live by the way.
And sae will we yet, &c.
Success to the farmer, and prosper his plough,
Rewarding his eident [3]' toils all the year through ;
Our seed-time and harvest we ever will get,
For we’ve lippen’d [4] aye to Providence, and sae will we yet.
And sae will we yet, &c.
Lang live the king, and happy may he be,
And success to his forces by land and by sea !
His enemies to triumph we ne’er will permit,
Britons aye ha’e been victorious, and sae will they yet.
And sae will they yet, &c-
Let the glass keep its course, and go merrily roun,
For the sun it will rise tho’ the moon has gane down ;
When the house is rinnin’ round about, it’s time enough to flit,
When we fell we aye got up again, and sae will we yet.
And sae will we yet, &c.

Then the eye shines sae bright, the haill soul to beguile,
There’s love in every whisper, and joy in every smile ;

And miss a bonnie lassie when the kye comes hame.

Yet he downa gang to rest, for his heart is in a liame
To meet his bonnie lassie when the kye comes hame.

MY BONNIE MARY.
Words by Robert Burns.
Go fetch to me a pint o’ wine, The trumpets sound, the banners fly,
And till it in a silver tassie; The glittering spears are ranked ready;.
The shouts o’ war are heard afar;
The battle closes thick and bloody—
That I may drink, before I go, The shouts o’ war are heard afar;
A : ervice to my bonnie lassie. The battle closes thick and bloody—
The boat rocks at the pier o’ Leith, But it’s not the roar o’ sea or shore
Fu’ loud the wind blaws frae the ferry ; Would mak’ me langer wish to tarry,
The ship rides by the Berwick Law, Nor shouts o’ war that’s heard afar —
And I maun leave my bonnie Mary. It’s leaving thee, my bonnie Mary.,

AULD ROBIN GRAY.
Music by Rev. Mr. beeves. Words by Lady Anne Lindsay.
Young Jamie lo’ed me week and sought me lor his bride;
But, saving a crown, he had naething else beside;
To make the crown a pound my Jamie gaed to sea,
And the crown and the pound were baith for me.
He hadna been gane a week but oidy twa,
When my father brak his arm and our cow was stown [4] awa’,
My mither she fell sick, and my Jamie at the sea—
And auld Robin Gray cam’ a-courting me.
My father urged me «air—my mither didna speak,
But she look’d in my face till my heart was like to break;
They gied him my hand, but my heart was at the sea;
And auld Robin Gray is gudeman to me.
I hadna been a wife a week but only four,
When sittin’ sae mournfully at my ain door,
I saw my Jamie’s ghaist—l couldna think it he,
Till he said, “ I’m come harae, my love, to marry thee.”
0 sair, sair did we greet, and mickle did we say;
We took but ae kiss, and then tore ourselves away.
1 wish that I were dead, but I’m no like to dee;
Oh why do I live to say, 0 wae’s me!
I gang like a ghaist, aim I carena to spin;
I darena think o’ Jamie, for that wad be a sin,
But I will do ray best a gude wife aye to be,
for auld Robin Gray, he is gudeman to me.

THE FOUR MARIES.
[lnserted by kind permission of Methven, Simpson, & Co., Dundee.]
Lost nicht there were four Maries,
This nicht there’ll be but three,
There was Alary Beaton, an’ Alary
Seaton,
An’ Alary Carmichael an’ me.
Oh little did my mither think
When first she cradled me,
That I would dee sae far frae hame,
Or hang on a gallows-tree.
They’ll tie a napkin round my e’en,
An’ they’ll no let me see to dee,
rowans,
My brothers, my sisters, an’ me.
The first three stanzas are from the old ballad; the last two are from the pen of a lady
resident in Dundee.
THE LASS OF
In lonely cot by Humberside,
I sit and mourn my hours away ;
For constant Will was Peggy’s pride,
But now he sleeps in Iceland’s bay.
Still as the ships pass to and fro
I fondly list to yo-ya-yo !
If loud and stormy winds were heard
As on my lonely bed I laid,
All night for Will alone I fear’d,
All night for Will alone I pray’d.
Still as the ships pass to and fro
I fondly list to yo-ya-yo !

AFTON WATER.

Music by Alexander Hume. Words by Burns.
Flow gently, sweet Alton, among thy green braes,
Flow gently, I’ll sing thee a song in thy praise ;
My Alary’s asleep by thy murmuring stream.
Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.
Thou stock-dove whose echo resounds thro’ the glen,
Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den,
Thou green crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear,
I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair.
Thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides,
And winds by the cot where my Alary resides ;
How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,
As gathering sweet flowerets she stems thy clear wans.
Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,
Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays ;
My Mary’s asleep by thy murmuring stream,
Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream.
Founded on the old ballad of “Marie Hamilton”
An’ they’ll ne’er let on to my father an’
mither,
But I’m awa’ o’er the sea.
I wish I could lie in our ain kirkyard
Aneatli the auld yew tree,
Where we pu’d the go wans, an’ thread the
But little care I for a nameless grave,
If I’ve hope for eternity.
So I’ll pray that the faith o’ the deein’ thiei
Alay be granted thro’ grace unto me.
At last the very ship appear’d,
In which my constant Will had sail’d;
In haste I ran to Humberside,
And loud and oft the sailors hail’d.
The deck they travers’d to and fro
And answer’d nought hut yo-ya-yo !
The boatswain now full near the shore,
I ask for Will—he shook his head;
“Ah me ! I fear he is no more.”
His answer was, “ Poor Will is dead ! *
Ah me ’ I felt oppressed with woe
And heard no more the yo-ya-yo !


I ANCE WAS A WANTER.
Words by Robert Nicol.
I anee was a wanter, as happy’s a bee ;
I meddled wi’ nane, and nane meddled wi’ me ;
I whiles had a crack [l] o’er a cog o’ gude yill, [2]
"Whiles a bicker o’ swats, whiles a heart-heezin’ gill.
And I aye had a groat if I hadna a pound,
On this earth there was nane meikle happier found.
But my auld mither died in the year auchty-nine,
And I’ve never had peace in this world sin syne. [3]
Fu’ sound may she sleep—a douce [4] woman was she,
Wi’ her wheel, and her cat, and her cuppie o’ tea;
My ingle [s] she keepit as neat as a preen,
And never speered questions as “ Whar hae ye been ? ”
As, “ What were you doin’'(” or, “ Wha was ye wi ?”
We were happy thegither, my mither and me.
But my auld, &c.
When my mither was gane, for a while I was wae;
But a young chap was I, and a wife 'I wad hae—
A wife I sune got, and I aye hae her yet,
And the folks think thegither we unco weel fit.
But my ain mind hae I, tho’ I daurna speak o’t,
For mair than her gallop I like my ain trot.
But my auld, &c.
When I wi’ a crony am taking a drap,
She’ll yammer [6] and ca’ me an auld drucken chap.
If an hour I bide out, loud she greets and she yowls,
And bans a’ gude fellows, baith bodies and sowls.
And yet what a care she has o’ her gude man,
Ye wad think I was doited [7] —I canna but ban.
But my auld, &c.
My gilpie young dochters are looking for men,
I’ll be a grandfather, or ever I ken.
The laddies are thinking on ruling the roast,
And their faither, puir body, ’s deaf as a post.
But he sees they’re upsettin’, sae crouse and sae bauld; [B]
Oh, why did I marry, and wherefore grow auld ?

And Scotland’s hills for me ;

And foaming through the fells.
Her fountains sing of freedom still
As they dash down the dells ;

But I will sing a rantin’ sang

That I hae begged, and begged frae
Heaven,
I’ll fling my rock and reel away,
Words by Lady Keith.
And dance and sing from morn till even':
For there is ane I winna name,
That conies the reigning bike to scatter;
And I’ll put on my bridal gown
That day our king comes ower the water,
I ha’e seen the gude auld day,
The'day o’ pride and chieftain glory,
When royal Stuarts bore the sway,
And ne’er heard tell o’ Whig or Tory.
My father was a good lord’s son,
My mother was an earl’s daughter,
And I’ll be Lady Keith again
That day our king comes ower the water.

Robin is my only jo,
For Robin has the art to lo’e,
So to his suit I mean to bow,
Because I ken he lo’es me.
Happy, happy was the show’r,
That led me to his birken bow’r,
Where first of love I fand the pow’r,
And ken’d that Robin lo’ed me.
He’s tall and soncy, frank and free,
Lo’ed by a’, and dear to me ;
Wi’ him I’d live, wi’ him I’d dee,
Because my Robin lo’es me.
My sister Mary said to me,
Our courtship but a joke wad be,
And I, ere lang, be made to see
That Robin did not lo’e me.
But little kens she what has been
Me and my honest Rob between,
And in his wooing, 0 so keen
Kind Robin is that lo’es me.
Then fly ye lazy hours away,
And hasten on the happy day, [say,
When “ Join your hands,” Mess John sha*l

Oh ! were I able to rehearse
My ewie’s praise in proper verse,
I’d sound it out as loud and fierce
As ever piper’s drone could blaw !
My ewie wi’ the crookit horn,
A’ that kenri’d her could hae sworn
Sic a ewie ne’er was born
Here about nor far awa !
I needed neither tar nor keel
To mark her upo’ hip or heel,
Her crookit hornie did as weel
To ken her by, amahg them a’.
Cauld nor hunger never dang (1) her,
Wind nor weet could never wrang her—
Ance she lay a week and langer
Forth aneath a wreath o’ suaw.
I looked aye at even for her,
Lest misshanter should conie o’er her,
Or the fumart (2) might devour her.
Gin the beastie bade awa’.

Tho’ a’ the warld should forbid it,

As this sin’ ever I was born ;
My ewie wi’ the crookit horn—
Silly ewie ! stown awa’!
0 had she died o’ croup or cauld,
As ewies die when they grow auld,
It had nae been, by mony fauld,
Sae sair a heart to ane o’ us a’;
For a’ the claith that we hae worn,
Frae her and hers sae aften shorn,
The loss o’ her we could hae borne,
Had fair strae death ta’en her aw»’ c
But : thus, poor thing ! to lose her life
Aneath .a greedy villain’s knife !
I’m really fieyt (5) that our gudewife
Will never win aboon’t awa’! (6)

BONNIE DUNDEE.
Words by Sir Walter Scott
To the Lords of Convention ’twas Claverhouse spoke,
Ere the king’s crown go down there are crowns tobe broke,
Then each cavalier that loves honour and me,
Let him follow,the bonnets of Bonnie Dundee.
Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can,
Come saddle my horses and call out my men ;
Unhook tire west port, and let us gae free,
For it’s up wi’ the bonnets 6’ Bonnie Dundee.
Dundee he is mounted, he rides up the street,
The bells they ring backward, the drums .they are beat,
But the provost (douce man) said, “ Just e’en let it be,
For the toun is weel rid o’ that deil o’ Dundee.”
Come .fill up ,my cup, ,&c.
There are hills beyond Pentland and lands beyond Forth,
If there’s lords in the south, there are chiefs in the north ;
There .are brave Duipnewassals three thousand times throe
Will cry “ Hey for the bonnets o’ Bonnie Dundee .”
Come fill up my cup, &c.
Then awa’ to the hills, to the lea, to the rocks,
Ere I own a usurper, I’ll crouch with the fox ;
And tremble, false whigs, jn the midst o’ your glee.
Ye hae no seen the last 0’ my bonnets and me !
Come fill up niy l cup, &c.

ABERFELDY.
Bonnie lassie, will ye go*
Will ye go, will ye go,
Bonnie lassie, will ye go.
To the birks o’ Alxwfeldy ?
Now simmer blinks on flow’ry braes,
And o’er the crystal streamlet plays-;
Come, let us spend the lightsome days
In the birks o’ Aberfeldy.
Words by Burns.
The little birdies blithely sing,
While o’er their heads the hazels hing ;
Or lightly flit on wanton wing,
In the birks o’ Aberfeldy.
The braes ascend like lofty wa’s,
The foaming stream deep roaring fa’s,
O’erhung wi’ fragrant spreading shaws,
Tire birks o’ Aberfeldy.
The hoary cliffs are crown’d wi’
White o’er the linn the bumie pours,
And, rising, weets wi’ misty showers
The birks o’ Aberfeldy.
Let fortune’s gifts at random flee,
They ne’er shall draw a wish frae i; %
Supremely blest wi’ love and thee
In the birks o’ Aberfeldy.

smooth flowing fountains, I sigh for the val-ley of dark Lochna - gar.
Ah ! there my young footsteps in infancy wandered,
My cap was the bonnet, my cloak was the plaid;
On chieftains departed my memory pondered,
As daily I strode thro’ the pine-covered glade.
I sought not my home till the day’s dying glory
Gave place to the rays of the bright polar star;
For fancy was cheered by traditional story
Disclos’d by the natives of dark Lochnagar.
Ancl to u»..
Shades of the dead, have I not heard your voices,
Rise on the night-rolling breath of the gale ?
Surely the soul of the hero rejoices,
And rides on the wind o’er his own Highland vale.
Round Lochnagar while the stormy mist gathers,
Winter presides in his cold icy car,
Clouds there encircle the forms of my fathers —
They dwell ’mid the tempests of dark Lochnagar.
Years have rolled on, Lochnagar, since I left you,
Years must elapse ere I see you again;
Tho’ nature of verdure and flowers has bereft you.
Yet still thou art dearer than Albion’s plain.
England, thy beauties are tame and domestic
To one who has roved o’er the mountains afar !
Oh for the crags that are wild and majestic,
The steep frowning glories of dark Lochnagar-
The bulbul swectay

MY LOVE’S
My love’s in Germanie,
Send him hame.
My love’s in Germanie,
Fechtin’ brave for loyalty,
He may ne’er his Jeanie see,
Send him hame. •
He’s brave as brave can be,
Send him hame.
He’s brave as brave can be,
He wad rather fa’ than flee,
But his love is dear to me,
Send him hame.
DUET-WHEN YE
When ye gang awa’ Jamie,
Far across the sea, laddie ;
When ye gang to Germanie,
What will ye send to me, Jamie ?
I’ll send ye a braw new gown, Jeanie,
The brawest a’ in the town, lassie ;
And it shall be o’ silk and gowd,
Wi’ Valenciennes set round, Jeanie.
That’s nae gift ava, Jamie,
That’s nae gift ava, laddie,
There’s ne’er a goun in a’ the toun
I’d like, when ye’re awa, Jamie.
When I come back again, Jeanie,
When I come back again, lassie,
I’ll bring wi’ me a gallant gay,
To be yer ain gudeman, Jeanie.
Be my gudeman yersel, Jamie,
Be my gudeman yersel, laddie,
And tak’ me ower to Germanie,
Wi’ you at hame to dwell, Jamie.
I dinna ken how that can be, Jeanie,
I dinna ken how that can be, lassie,
For I’ve a wife and bairnies three,
And I’m no sure how ye’d agree, Jeanie.

And meikle thinks my love o’ my kin ;
But little thinks my love I ken brawly
My tocher’s [l] the jewel has charms for

It’s a’ for the apple he’ll nourish the tree ;
It’s a’ for the honey he’ll cherish the bee ;

He canna ha’e love to spare for me.

Gae back to your wife and hame, Jamie,
Gae back to your bairnies three, laddie ;
And I will pray they ne’er may thole

A LUMP O’ LAND.
Words by Allan Ramsay.
I hate with poortith, though bonnie, to
meddle;
Unless they bring cash, or a lump o’ land,
They’se ne’er get me to dance to their
fiddle.
There’s meikle gude love in bands and bags,
And siller and gold’s a sweet complexion,
But beauty and wit, and virtue in rags,
Have tint [3] the art of gaining affection
Love tips his arrows with woods and parks;
And castles, and riggs, and muirs, and
meadows;
And naething can catch our modern sparks,
But weel-tocher’d lasses or jointur’d
widows.

MY OWN LOVED LAND.
[Published, lull music size, by Weekes & Co,
lii ev’ry changing scene I trace
But thee, my own loved land ;
No spot on earth can e’er efface
Thy rugged mountains grand.
Where’er I go the Scottish tongue
Falls sweetest on mine ear ;
And when I hear an auld Scots sang,
Starts to my e’e the tear.
Fve trod the snow-clad Alpine heights,
By Ganges roamed and Nile,
But Ind or Afric fails to charm
Like thee, my native isle.

To be sae nice wi’ Robin.

Words and Music by W. Henderson.
When eager eyes scan news from home
I look but for thy name;
In peaceful contest or in war
Thirst only for thy fame.
A breach is stormed, a fortress ta’en—
Where were the bonnets blue ?
What though my moistening eyes grow dim,
I know the Scots were true !
Like mountain torrent on they sweep—
Where’er the tartans wave
They’ll seek the thickest of the fight,
Or shroud in death the brave.

Oh ! quo’ the wee bit wifikie, this is nae me, quo’ she,
Somebody’s been fellin’ me, somebody’s been fellin’ me, this is nae me !

And still if this be Bessikie, three placks remain wi’ me,
But I will in the pursie leuk, see gin the cunzie [2] be :
There’s neither purse nor plack aboot me ! this is nae me, quo’ she,
There’s neither purse nor plack aboot me, neither purse nor plack aboot me,

I ha’e a little housikie, but and a kindly man ;
A dog, they ca’ him Doussikie ; if this be me he’ll fawn ;
And Johnnie, he’ll come to the door, and kindly welcome gi e,
And a’ the bairns on the floor head will dance if this be me, quo’ she,
Dance if this be me, quo’ she, dance if this be me, quo’ she, dance if this be me.
The nicht was late, and dang oot weet, [3] and oh but it was dark;
The doggie heard a body’s foot, and he began to bark.

When Johnnie heard his Bessie’s voice, fast to the door he ran,
And cried, “Is that you Bessikie ?”—“ Wow, wow, wow, na man !

John ran to the Minister, his hair stood a’ on end,
I’ve gotten sie a fricht, kind sir, I'm fear’d I’ll never mend ;

Oh fare-ye-weel, my Johnnie, quo’ she, this is nae me, quo’ she,
This is nae me, quo’ she, this is nae me, quo’ she, this is nae me.
The tale you tell, the Parson said, is wonderful to me,
How that a wife without a head, could speak, or hear, or see !
But things that happen hereabout so strangely alter’d be
That I could say with Bessikie, ’tis neither you nor she, quo’ he,
Neither you nor she, quo’ he, neither you nor she, quo’ he, neither you nor she.
But Johnnie he ran hame again, and oh ! but he was fain
To see his little wifikie come to herseT again;
He got her sittin’ on a stool, wi’ the bairnie on her knee,
Oh ! come awa, Johnnie, quo’ she, come awa to me,

Beyond the sea, beyond the sun,
Till my last weary sand was run,

Ere ever Ossian’s lofty voice
Had told of Fingal’s fame;
Ere ever from their native clime
The Roma* eagles came,
Our land had given heroes birth
That durst the boldest brave,
And taught above tyrannic dust
The thistle tufts to wave.
What need we say how Wallace fought,
And how his foemen fell;
Or how on glorious Bannockburn
The work went wild and well ?
Ours is the land of gallant hearts,
The land of honour’d graves,
Whose wreath of fame shall ne’er depart
While yet the thistle waves !

No matter what the ioumey be—
Advent’rous, dangerous, far,
To ocean deep,, or bleak frontier,
To loneliness or war.
Yet something cheers the heart that dares
In all of human kind ;
And he who goes is happier far
, Than those he leaves behind.
God wills it so—and so it is ;
The pilgrims on their way,
Though weak and worn, more cheerful are
Than all the rest who stay.
And when at last man’s course is run,
His spirit unconfined,
In realms above is happier far
Than those he leaves behind.

‘ Sirs, I’m to be married the night,
And has neither blankets nor sheets,

The bride that has a’ thing to borrow
Has e’en right meikle ado.’

Had he kent ye as weel as I;

Gin I canna get a better,

It’s a’ that I desire ;
But we plain folk maun live single,
And do the best that we can,
I dinaa care what I should want
If I could just get a man.’
Woo’d and married, &o.
Out spake the bride’s father,
As he cam’ in frae the pleugh,
‘ 0 baud yer tongue, my daughter,
And ye’s get gear enough ;
The stirk that stands i’ the tether,
And our braw bawsin’t yade,
Will carry ye hame your corn ;
What would ye be at, ye jade I ’
Woo’d and married, &c.
Out spoke the bride’s mither,
‘ What for needs a’ this pride;
I had nae a plack in my pouch
That night I was a bride ;
My gown was linsey-wolsey,
I was far mair bonnie than braw,
Be thankfu’ a good man likes ye,
That’s meat and claes and a’.’
Then out spake the cantie bridegroom,
‘ What though we be scant o’ claes,
We’ve plenty o’ love in our hearts
To warm us a’ our days.
Then dicht your e’en my dawtie,
And come awa’ hame wi’ me,
Come ane, come a’, to the weddin’,
Fu’ welcome ye shall be.’

Wi’ tartan plaid and bonnet blue, For she was bashfu’ before unco folk,

And braw houses twa or three.

Quo’ she, ‘Jock, I’m weel content,’

‘ 0, mither, fetch us some gude meat;
A piece of the butter was kirn’d the day,
That Jockey and I thegither may eat.’
Jockey unto Jenny did say,
‘ Jenny, my dear, I want nae meat;
And I will gie them a’ to thee,
‘ A faith,’ quo Jenny, ‘ I fear you mock ; ’
* Then, foul fa’ me, gin I scorn thee ;
If ye’ll be my Jenny, I’ll be your Jock.’
Jenny lookit, and syne she leuch ;
‘Ye first maun get my mither’s consent; ’
It was nae for meat that I came here,
But a’ for the love of you, Jenny, my dear
Jenny she gaed up the gate,
Wi’ a green gown as side as her smock ;
And aye say loud as her mither did rair,
‘ Vow, sirs ! has nae Jenny got Jock !
MY HAWK IS TIRED OF PERCH AND HOOD,
Words by Sir W. Scott Music arranged from the Melody of Thomas Macfarlane.
My hawk is tired of perch and hood,
My idle greyhound loathes his food ;
My horse is weary of his stall,
And I am tired of captive thrall.
I wish I were, as I have been,
Hunting the hart thro’ forest green,
With bended bow, and blood-hound free,
0 that s the life that’s meet for me.
No more at morning dawn I rise,
And sun myself in Helen’s eyes,
Drive the fleet deer the forest through,
Nor homeward wend with the evening dew;
No more a kindly welcome meet,
Nor lay my trophies at her feet,
While sped the eve with mirth and glee—
That life is lost to love and me.
My hawk is tired, &c.
My hawk is tired, &c.

An’ a’ their faults will no be seen, my jo Janet.
Sweet sir, for your courtesie,
When ye gae by the cross, then,
For the love ye bear to me
Buy me a pacin’ horse then.
Pace upon your spinnin’ wheel, Janet, Janet,
An’ that’ll serve ye just as weel, my jo Janet.
