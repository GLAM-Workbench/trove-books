FOREWORD
This interesting booklet, written by a Sister
of Saint Joseph for the benefit of Catholic
girls leaving school, fills an obvious gap.
Ordinary books of etiquette, laying stress,
as they do, only upon the social aspect of
manners, leave out the basis of all polite be-
haviour; namely, regard and consideration for
fellow men and women. The writer, going
down to the root of the matter, explains
clearly just why such and such polite customs
have become obligatory on truly civilised
people, and, by so doing, has given them ad-
ditional weight.
Reading her book, the young Catholic girl
is instructed effectively on all points of correct
behaviour in society and in the course of
daily work and amusement. The feeling of
inferiority that has its root in consciousness
of ignorance or wretched uncertainty as to
“what one should do,’’ passes away, poise and
dignity taking its place.
Any Catholic girl who reads and takes to
heart these valuable instructions, will find her
attitude to religion rendered firmer and more
correct, in an irreligious world; her manners
to those about her refined and improved; and
her worldly prospects certainly not lessened.


by the acquirement of manners that must
inevitably recommend her to those about her.
Sister has retained throughout an entirely
modern note, especially in the matter of such
vexed questions as the use of cosmetics, the
wearing of new style clothing, conduct at
dances and other entertainments.
The book should certainly become the
favourite companion of all Catholic girls
leaving school.

Christian Courtesy
for
Catholic Girls
CHAPTER I.
Introductory Maxims.
1. Politeness is a Christian virtue, and,
as Christians, we are bound to
practice it.
2. True politeness, that can be
counted on not to break down
under stress of circumstances, is
founded on religion.
3. Our Catholic girls are expected to
bear the stamp of their Catholic
training and to act “true to label”
every time.
4. Self-restraint, self-control, and re-
pose of manner are expected of
girls who are taught daily to imitate
Our Lady, the Sweet Queen of
Heaven, whose acts of courtesy are
woven, like a golden thread,


through the Gospel story. All that
we know of the life of the Blessed
Virgin shows her kindness and con-
sideration for others. Neither her
intimate union with God nor her de-
tachment from earthly things
prevented her from maintaining
friendly relations with her neigh-
bours. She offered them her ser-
vices and congratulations, was pre-
sent at their feasts, and showed
them the most delicate attention.
She combined, in her life, rigid at-
tention to duty with constant amia-
bility, and absolute correctness of
conduct with a courtesy full of
charm.
5. Politeness is a virtue which is
sociable in nature and purpose.
6. This virtue, it is impossible to ac-
quire without great self-denial and
constant vigilance.
7. True politeness is the doing of kind
acts in the kindest possible way. It
means forgetting self and thinking
of others, hence all rules of good
manners are based on consideration
for others.
8. There is an irresistible charm about
a good-mannered girl, and Ca.holic
girls should always be charming,


because their religion teaches char-
ity, and politeness is charity to-
wards others.
9. You want to be charming. There is
nothing wrong about that. Be
simple, be natural, be unaffected, be
gracious, then you will be truly
polite and truly charming.
10. Observance of the small and fine
rules of good manners is the mark
of a well-bred girl.
11. Catholic girls should remember that
they are in the minority. The eyes
of others are upon them with a par-
ticular scrutiny just because they
are Catholics, and, from their con-
duct and manners, the observer
judges the whole body of Catholic
girls.
12. Cardinal Newman says, “Good
manners are the outward signs of
Christianity.”
13. Our Lord has said, “He who will
come after Me, let him take up his
cross daily and follow Me.” By the
cross is meant the little hardships,
annoyances and disappointments of
daily life. Taking up these daily
crosses means bearing them for His


sake with a smiling face, with good-
will and without self-pity; and, as
it is a way of following Him, it is
eternally worthwhile.


CHAPTER II.
Reverence.
1. Morning and night prayers are our
salutations to our Creator. These
acts of reverential courtesy should
never be omitted. Morning prayers
should be said devoutly before leav-
ing the bedroom. No matter how
late the hour, a Catholic girl should
never retire at night without hon-
ouring God by saying her night
prayers.
2. In these days of boarding-school
education, there might be a ten-
dency, when away from school, to
forget morning prayers, owing to
the custom of saying them in com-
mon at school. Strange to say,
there is not the same tendency to
neglect night prayers, though the
need for God’s blessing and protec-
tion is much greater during the
dangers of the day.
3. Our girls would do well to observe
the beautiful Catholic custom of
saluting the members of their
household with “Good morning.
God bless you,” and “Good night.
God bless you.”


4. Abstain from using the name of
God in your ordinary conversation,
merely to secure emphasis.
5. Adopt a becoming posture in church
and at religious functions, and show
consideration for the convenience
of others.
6. Be present in church before any
religious exercise begins. Courtesy
demands this. Moreover, it is a
serious obligation to be in time for
Sunday Mass.
7. It is not correct to salute anyone in
the church.
8. Men take precedence of women in
the church. A man leads the way,
when he is entering the church with
a woman. He offers her holy water,
precedes her down the aisle, but
stands aside for her to enter and
take the inside seat.
9. When you go to Holy Mass, do not
remain near the door. There is
usually plenty of space farther up.
When taking your place, do not
leave unoccupied space farther on
in the pew, and expect late-comers
to clamber past you. Should a per-
son wish to pass you in the church,
stand, so that you may be passed
with greater ease and decorum.


10. Do not merely be “in the church,”
but assist at Holy Mass devoutly by
using your prayer book, preferably
a missal.
11. It is proper to stand, when the
Celebrant of Holy Mass enters the
church; also when he is about to
leave.
12. Kneel when the “Sanctus” bell
rings as a preparation for the
Canon —the most sacred part of the
Mass.
13. During the Canon, avoid fidgeting,
coughing, or making any noise.
Reverential silence should prevail.
14. In going to the Altar-rails for Holy
Communion, and in returning, keep
your hands joined and your eyes
cast down, and let your whole ex-
terior express reverence.
15. Be quietly and cleanly dressed when
going to the Holy Communion, and
remove your gloves before ap-
proaching the altar-rails.
16. The Communion plate should be
held under your chin while you are
receiving, and then passed with
your right hand to the left hand of
the person next you.
17. If a Bishop is giving Holy Com-
munion, kiss his ring before receiv


mg. Do not close your eyes until
you have kissed the ring.
18. Leave the altar-rails when the
priest has communicated the per-
son next to you.
19. Do not genuflect when returning to
your place after receiving Holy
Communion.
20. Spend about a quarter of an hour
in thanksgiving.
21. When attending at Mass or Bene-
diction, remain in the church until
the priest has left the Sanctuary. It
is most irreverent and discourteous
to act otherwise.
22. Our reverence is the measure of our
politeness towards God.
23. Conform to the rules of your parish
with regard to the times for going
to Confession.
24. Those waiting for Confession
should preserve the order of prece-
dence and not take the place of
others who have been waiting
longer.
25. Do not look around in the church
nor stare at others.
26. Public prayers, such as the Rosary,
Litanies, etc., should be answered


distinctly and reverently. No re-
sponse should be begun before the
invocation is finished.
27. When passing the church, show
your respect by bowing your head.
28. Salute ecclesiastics and religious
respectively.
29. It is the correct thing to kiss the
Bishop’s ring when you meet him
or are presented to him.
30. Courtesy requires that you visit
your parish priest and former
teachers on returning from board-
ing school.
31. Call on the parish priest on remov-
ing to a new parish.
32. Generously offer to assist your
parish priest in church affairs, if
your services are either useful or
necessary.
33. Show your respect to churches, to
sacred things, to relics, cemeteries,
memorials, monuments, etc.
34. Show proper respect to persons to
whom respect is due —to priests,
nuns, brothers; to your parents,
teachers—and all in authority. They
all hold their position directly or
indirectly from God.
35. Holy things should never be made
the subject of jest, neither should


reputation, merit, nor the memory
of the dead.
36. If possible, have fixed hours for ris-
ing and retiring.
37. On awakening, give your first
thoughts to God by the Sign of the
Cross and a Morning Offering.
38. Dress modestly, avoiding conversa-
tion whilst dressing. Remember
that your body is the temple of the
Holy Ghost, and that your Guardian
Angel is always with you.
39. You should strive to make the at-
mosphere of your home religious
and entirely Catholic.
40. Avoid any reading that might
weaken faith or endanger purity.
Immoral or even doubtful literature
is an insult to good taste. Every
Catholic girl should be an apostle
of good taste.
41. Sporting activities should never in-
terfere with one’s religious duties.
Public sporting clubs will readily
adapt their programmes to the con-
venience of Catholic members, if
the Catholic members show that
religion holds first place with them.
42. Every Catholic girl should accustom
herself to bear small trials cheer


fully. This will develop fortitude to
meet courageously the graver trials
of life and extract from them
strength and sweetness. This is the
secret of true happiness.
43. Generally speaking, the Catholic
mother will see that her girls are
faithful to the essentials of their
holy religion, while she leaves
them full liberty with regard to
those practices not of obligation.
44. Sponsors in Baptism should be
good Catholics of at least fourteen
years of age. Non-Catholics may
not act in this capacity. The god-
mother holds the infant to be bap-
tised and the godfather stands at
her right.
45. A sponsor for Confirmation should
be of the same sex as the candidate
and at least fourteen years of age.
She places her right hand on the
shoulder of the person to the con-
firmed.
46. In choosing a state of life, be
guided, above all, by the thought of
God and the salvation of your soul.
God will direct your choice, if such
are your motives.
47. If you feel drawn towards the Re-
ligious Life, your first step should


be to ask the guidance and advice
of your confessor.
48. Do not take any serious step in the
choice of a state of life without the
advice and consent of your parents.
49. The preliminaries to marriage
should be arranged with the parish
priest, who will explain all that is
necessary about impediments,
banns, and the time of celebration.
He should be notified at least a
month in advance.
50. The Church has placed in her
Liturgy a beautiful Nuptial Mass.
It should be the ambition of every
Catholic girl to be married at a
Nuptial Mass.
51. Those in charge of the sick should
see that Extreme Unction is re-
ceived as soon as the sickness be-
gins to be serious, and before
consciousness is lost.
52. Prepare, in the sick room, a table
covered with a clean white cloth.
Place on it a serviette, a towel, a
Crucifix, two lighted candles in
candlesticks, a container for holy
water, a glass of water, and a
spoon.


53. When the priest comes to the front
door, meet him with a lighted
candle and escort him, without
speaking, to the sick room.
54. After the Confession is finished, the
family gather round the sick bed
to kneel and pray while the last
sacraments are being administered.
55. When Holy Communion is brought
to the sick at other times, there
should be at least two lighted
candles on the table in the sick
room.
56. It is a Catholic custom to kneel
and obtain the blessing of a newly-
ordained priest.
57. Avoid bad company. Let your
chosen companions be few and vir-
tuous. A girl is judged by her com-
pany.
58. Remember that self-improvement
depends upon the grace of God.
Hence the importance of due appre-
ciation and devout frequentation of
the Sacraments.
59. Offer your best work to God. Your
second best is unworthy of Him and
of yourself.


CHAPTER III.
The Influence of a Good Catholic Girl.
1. As it is God’s purpose that woman
should play a noble part in life, He
has given His own Immaculate
Mother as a model.
2. Scripture says of the valiant
woman, “Prom afar and from the
utmost bounds is her price.”
3. Our holy religion teaches us two
very important lessons; to have a
great esteem for our dignity and, at
the same time, to be very humble.
Neither virtue is opposed to the
other.
4. A sense of her own dignity is a
girl’s greatest protection.
5. A girl can have self-respect without
being cold, artificial or stiff. She
can be perfectly natural and
friendly without loss of dignity.
6. The blame for the decay of home
life, as well as the only hope of re-
form for that evil, rests with
woman,
7. Men and women will be what their
home training makes them. It is
the mother who makes or mars the
home.


8. Our present-day girls will be the
moulders for good or ill of the
future generation.
9. Any girl who intends to marry
should, in justice, equip herself to
contribute to the happiness of her
new home. Self-sacrifice, patience,
amiability, etc., will not spring into
being in an instant, neither will
a knowledge of cooking and house-
hold affairs.
10. Our Catholic girls should realise
their great responsibility; that it is
in the power of woman, by devotion
to family and home, to save the
world from moral ruin.
11. Every girl and woman can exercise
influence for good in her surround-
ings. It is for them to show a
wicked world that they can enjoy
the good things of life, without for-
saking the Sacraments, neglecting
their homes, indulging in intoxicat-
ing drinks, and making themselves
cheap and common.
12. Catholic girls should be leaders in
the crusade against cocktails,
strong drink and drugs, paganism
in pictures, dress, literature and
amusements.


13. Pleasure and enjoyment are gifts of
God. Take them in moderation, and
they will be a help as well as a
recreation.
14. Take a reasonable share of the
amenities of life, such as sport, etc.,
but, when you notice that share
exceeding due proportion, have the
courage to act as you should.
15. Girls should cultivate that truly
maidenly reserve which resents the
least liberty and compels others to
keep their place.
16. They should remember that sub-
jects of questionable delicacy, news-
paper scandals, etc., should never
be discussed between men and
women.
17. A man’s chivalry invariably de-
pends, not on the politeness a
woman shows to him, but on her
politeness to herself, self-respect,
to use another term for it, or good
manners.
18. The single life in the world is often
one of heroism, demanding great
sacrifices. The courage to cope
with such demands is acquired by
girlhood training in self-mastery.
19. Our ordinary duties, whether they
be the care of the home, tending an


infirm parent or younger brothers
or sisters, working in an office, etc.,
or living leisurely at home with
little occupation, will all bring their
own obligations and their own
trials.
20. The Church does not interfere with
your free will. She gives you good
advice and puts the Sacraments at
your disposal, but your use or abuse
of these means of grace will make
you exactly what you choose to
make yourself—a good or bad
Catholic.
21. If being a girl is a great responsi-
bility, being a Catholic girl is still
greater, but it is only a Catholic
girl that has the help of the Sacra-
ments.
22. As a Catholic, you have received
the highest dignity that can be
conferred upon a human being, so
the straightforward and simple
thing for you to do is to act as a
Catholic should.


CHAPTER IV.
At Home.
1. Politeness should be practised, es-
pecially in the home, where your
very best behaviour should be in
evidence. Home is the one place
above all others where you should
practise those little kindnesses and
exercise towards others that care
and thoughtfulness which help so
much to make life happy and
pleasant.
2. The truly good-mannered do not
keep their manners for company,
but exercise them, as a matter of
course, within the family circle.
Moreover, the girl who desires to
behave well when out, must prac-
tise to do so at home.
3. We owe most courtesy to the
members of our family, because
they deserve it most. They are our
best friends in joy or sorrow, health
or sickness.
4. Courtesy in the home is doing what-
ever saves others trouble. Rising
promptly in the morning, dressing
neatly, and seating yourself punc-
tually at the breakfast table, with


a cheerful greeting to all, are acts
of politeness to your family.
5. The two things most opposed to
politeness in the home are selfish-
ness and moroseness.
6. Likewise, the two most powerful
aids to politeness are a sincere
affection for relatives and friends,
and a desire to please and oblige
them. Common sense dictates that
the home should be made as pleas-
ant as possible.
7. Mothers should train their girls to
be courteous at home. No cere-
monious politeness is required, but
an unselfish interest shown by each
for the welfare of the others.
8. Being indifferent is the commonest
way in which girls are impolite to
members of their own family. A
fairly good test of our politeness in
the home circle is to ask ourselves
if we treat the members of our own
family exactly as we should treat
our visitors.
9. A polite girl can do many little
things to make her mother’s life
easier. A devoted daughter should
be her mother’s right hand, her con


solation in sorrow, the confidante of
all her joys.
10. It is a serious breach against
politeness and often a sin against
the Fourth Commandment to show
want of consideration for parents.
Show great respect to them, as they
hold the place of God in your
regard.
11. This respect is shown by proper
salutations, by giving place, by
offering assistance.
12. Rise when your parents enter the
room, and see that they are com-
fortably seated before you sit down
again.
13. When you meet them in the street,
salute them as you would salute
your friends.
14. On returning from school or busi-
ness in the afternoon, an unselfish,
well-mannered girl will have a word
of cheer for her mother, who has
been harassed with household cares
in her absence.
15. Always speak respectfully of your
parents and be careful not to show
any disrespect for their opinions,
especially in company.
16. As they grow old, re-double your
attention to them. Respect for aged


parents is the perfection of filial
love.
17. Your parents should always receive
extra courtesy, such as the best
chair and the first serving at meals.
18. Always close doors quietly. Never
slam them.
19. Laughing and talking too loudly are
marks of bad manners.
20. In your own home, try to keep
up a conversation that will interest
others as well as yourself. Avoid
scandalous or unkind gossip. Have
your mind too-well stored for per-
sonalities. Evil gossip and tale-
bearing are the height of ill-
breeding.
21. Keep up your music and singing to
give pleasure in the home circle.
22. Be well acquainted with the Eng-
lish classics and some of the most
desirable new books, and keep in
touch with current events to render
your conversation pleasant and
wholesome.
23. In the homes of people who are
truly good-mannered, quarrels, dis-
putes, slang and profanity are never
hoard.


24. Should quarrels or arguments
occur,, they should never be con-
ducted before visitors or those out-
side the family circle.
25. Be considerate, polite and pleasant
to domestics, but never gossip with
them nor in their presence.
26. Be loyal to your homefolk, and do
not betray home secrets to the out-
side world.
27. Be kind and considerate to your
brothers and sisters, remembering
that deference to the wishes of
others is the finest breeding. Be
specially polite to the small brother
and sister.
28. Do not discuss your ailments or
diseases in public.
29. When anyone is entertaining by
playing, singing, or reciting, observe
an interested silence.
30. Be particular about trifles, such as
not using too much perfume, not
tilting your chair, etc. Never drag
chairs—lift them.
31. Cultivate a gentle, amiable manner
of acquitting yourself of your
household duties, and be most care-
ful not to inconvenience others in
the performance of their duties.


32. Be always willing to oblige others.
Accept graciously any help offered
to you. Failure to accept a favour
graciously indicates a lack of good
manners.
33. Every girl should make herself
reasonably well acquainted with
first-aid, home-nursing, furnishing,
and the cooking of wholesome and
appetising dishes. Success in
home-making depends, to a great
extent, on these homely arts.
34. Strive to make the home a place of
happiness and peace for those
members of the family who are out
all day at business. A sweet-toned
voice and the facility of expressing
judicious praise and appreciation,
are powerful factors for keeping the
home happy.
35. Greet the members of the family
with a pleasant “Good morning” at
the beginning of the day, and wish
them a courteous “Good night”
when retiring.
36. If taken unawares by a caller, re-
ceive her naturally and do not
apologise for your own appearance
or that of your house.


37. A good Catholic mother, by her own
example, trains her girls to self-
sacrifice.
SB. It is the mark of a lady to pass over
unnoticed any breach of good man-
ners or ignorance of social usage
In another. Our Catholic girls
should remember that the facilities
they enjoy for acquiring an easy,
gracious manner were denied their
parents and those of an older
generation. To draw attention to
an error in social usage is a
grossly ill-mannered act.
19! Unselfishness is the basis of polite-
ness. Love of those dear to her is
a powerful lever which lifts a girl
above her indolence and her moods
and enables her to practise cour-
tesy in the home.
40. Good manners at table are essen-
tial. A special chapter, therefore,
is devoted to table etiquette.
41. Treat your homefolk with a judic-
ious mixture of the courtesy due to
visitors and the affection shown to
those you love, and you will be truly
and charmingly polite.


CHAPTER V.
Table Etiquette.
1. Our table manners must be correct
if we would be truly courteous.
2. It is an offence against good man-
ners to be late for meals. Offer
your apologies if you arrive late.
8. Breakfast is a pleasant, informal
meal at which a certain latitude
with regard to punctuality is per-
missible.
4. Be properly dressed, clean and tidy
before you approach the table.
6. Go quietly to the table and seat
yourself in an easy, upright posi-
tion. Ladies seat themselves first
6. Neither lean over the table nor
back in the chair.
7. Think mostly of pleasing others and
as little as possible about yourself.
Be attentive to the needs of others
and do not choose the best for
yourself.
8. It is not correct to read letters,
papers, etc., at meals in the pre-
sence of others. If a letter must
b« read, ask permission first


9. Do not leave the table before the
meal is finished. If it is necessary
to do so, ask to be excused.
10. The table napkin should be spread
across the knees.
11. Keep a plate or anything that is
handed to you. Do not pass it to
your neighbour. What is handed
to you is intended for yourself.
12. Liquids are served on the right,
food on the left.
13. In declining a dish, do not make
remarks about it to your neighbour.
Simply decline it without giving
reasons.
14. When sending your plate for a sec-
ond helping, place knife and fork
together close to the side of your
plate. A second helping is not
taken except at a family meal or in
a friendly, informal atmosphere.
15. A hostess in suggesting a second
helping considerately avoids the use
of the word “more,” which is a re-
minder that the guest has already
had some. This applies to formal
occasions, not to meals within the
family circle, or with intimate
friends, where the success of the
meal depends upon simplicity and
naturalness.


16. If a guest is sufficiently intimate at
a friend’s house to ask for a sec-
ond helping, it is correct for her to
use the word “more” to show grate-
ful remembrance for having already
had some.
17. When a course is finished, it is cor-
rect to place knife and fork or
spoon and fork together, leaving a
clean part of the plate for the
waitress to take hold of.
18. A hostess should not finish her
helping before her guests.
19. A guest, invited for only one meal,
places the table napkin unfolded
beside her place. In one’s own
home, or as a guest in the home of
a friend, it is customary to fold the
table napkin and replace it in the
ring.
20. Do not press food upon a guest.
21. Bat quietly and not ravenously.
Hurrying in any way at the table
is both greedy and impolite.
22. Never fill your mouth so full that
you cannot talk comfortably. Eat-
ing and drinking should be per-
formed separately.
23. At table, use your handkerchief as
little as possible.


24. Be careful not to stretch across
another’s plate for anything.
26. At an hotel table or in a public res-
taurant he careful not to keep the
salt, sugar, etc., near your plate
after you have helped yourself. Re-
place them where they may be
easily reached by others.
26. Never use your own knife to take
butter, nor your own spoon to take
sugar. The special butter knife,
etc., should be used and then re-
stored to its proper place. Should
the butter knife, or anything simi-
lar, be missing from the table, do
not draw attention to its absence.
27. Stir your tea quietly, and then
leave your teaspoon in the saucer.
28. The handles of both knife and fork
should be held in the palms of the
hand.
29. The knife and fork should not be
held continuously in the hands,
and, when using them, keep your
elbows close to your side.
30. Do not eat with a knife. Never
take with a spoon what can be
taken with a fork.
31. In taking soup it is not considered
good form to tilt the plate. If this


is done, however, it should always
be tilted away from you.
32. Soup should be taken noiselessly
with the side of the large spoon
provided. Fill your spoon away
from you, not toward you.
33. It is not correct to have two help-
ings of soup.
34. Bread should not be crumbled into
soup or gravy.
35. Bread should be cut into small
pieces before being buttered. It Is
not correct to butter or jam a whole
slice at once.
36. Knives are placed on the right of
the plate in order of use, the first
knife to be used on the outside. The
forks are placed on the left in simi-
lar order.
37. A mistake of any sort will probably
pass unnoticed unless you draw at-
tention to it.
38. If you are not sure of the etiquette
at table, it is wise to watch and
imitate those well acquainted with
the rules of table etiquette.
89. Talk on light and cheerful topics
that will make entertainment. Dis-
agreeable topics and worries should
not be discussed. Meal-time should


be the occasion for one’s sweetest
manners and most charming con-
versation.
40. Girls should be attentive to others
at table, particularly to anyone un-
avoidably late. In the home, the
mother or elder sister, who has
cooked the meal and sits down late,
should receive special attention.
41. Never fail to say grace before and
after meals.
42. Remember that food is God’s gift
and should be received with grati-
tude.
43. Guests should be allowed to enter
the dining-room first, should be
placed in a position of honour, and
should be served first. Ladies, in-
cluding those of the household, are
served before gentlemen.
44. At table, as elsewhere, simplicity
is the best form. Everything is con-
ducted on simple, straightforward
lines, e.g., “May I have the salt?”
takes the place of the stilted “May
I trouble you for the salt?”
45. As the essence of politeness is con-
sideration for others, common-
sense will guide you in matters un-
provided for.


CHAPTER VI.
School
1. At school you have the opportunity
of acquiring the qualities which
will be most useful and necessary
in later life.
2. Nothing of value can be done with-
out training, and at school you are
trained.
3. The main purpose of education is
to train the character. It is a ser-
ious handicap in life if the mind
has been trained, but not the heart
and the will. Real education is the
training of all three.
4. Without Religion you may have in-
formation, but not education. It is
by Religion that the heart and will
are trained.
5. At school you form habits of regu-
larity. Regularity is one of the
secrets of success in life.
6. Accustom yourself to keep rules.
You will have rules to keep all your
life.
7. The school bell is the voice of God
calling you to the work of your
education.


8. Work well with enthusiasm and
method. Work is the way to hap-
piness.
9. Aim at acquiring a thorough and
accurate knowledge of all the sub-
jects taught.
10. Rely upon yourself and trust your
own efforts. If you deceive your
teacher or cheat at examinations,
you are not acting in accordance
with good manners.
11. For success in school work the
power of attention is very neces-
sary. In class, concentrate upon
the parts of the lesson most impor-
tant for you.
12. The measure of your politeness in
school is the sincerity of your ef-
forts to improve yourself. A Catho-
lic girl is bound, in fairness to her
parents and teachers, to be dili-
gent in school. In this way she per-
forms the duties of her state in life.
13. In private study there must be
order. Have a regular time for
study and have all the necessary
material at hand so that you may
begin promptly.
14. Start each study period with the
determination to learn your lessons


well and quickly. Keep your atten-
tion on your work, and, after
studying each lesson, close the
book and try to recall the impor-
tant facts. In this way you test
your knowledge of the main facts.
15. Cultivate the habit of consulting
external aids, such as a dictionary,
an encyclopaedia, etc.
16. Remember that you have a duty to
your school, as the tone of the
school depends on you. Even one
girl can lower the reputation of the
school.
17. To let your school down is worse
than bad form. It is a sin against
justice.
18. Be proud of your school, and leave
it regretfully with a worthy record.
19. The courteous school girl is one
who respects the rights of others
and who co-operates in all matters
that are for the common good.
20. Much that has been advised in
other parts of this book about po-
liteness in the home, in public, in
conversation, etc., can be applied
to school.
21. Our Catholic schools should be the
seed-plots of courtesy. Show to


your teachers the courtesy you
practise towards your parents and
elders, and show to your school
companions the same courtesy as
to your brothers and sisters.
22. Be regular and punctual in your
attendance.
23. Stand when the teacher enters the
class-room and when she is about
to leave it.
24. Open the door for her when she
approaches it, and if she is carry-
ing anything heavy, relieve her of
it.
25. Salute your teachers respectfully
on arriving at school and on leav-
ing.
26. See that the teacher’s desk and
chair are ready for her, and that
the class-room is clean and neat.
Attend to any necessary prepara-
tion, such as opening windows,
cleaning the blackboard, etc.
27. In class, stand or sit erect. Do not
slouch.
28. Speak distinctly to enable all in the
class to hear what you say.
29. Do not answer a question address-
ed to another, and never make fun
of another’s mistakes.


30. Interruptions of any kind in the
class-room are as rude as if made
elsewhere.
31. Keep your desk and school mater-
ial neat and in order.
32. Waste paper should be put in the
basket provided and should not be
allowed to fall on the floor nor to
accumulate in your desk.
33. Treat the school property as care-
fully as if it were your own.
34. Be proud of the appearance of your
school and its surroundings, and
help to keep both school and play-
ground as clean, neat and beauti-
ful as possible.
35. Avoid borrowing books, pens, pen-
cils, etc., without permission of the
owner.
36. The books and papers on the
teacher’s desk belong either to her
or to the school. You have no right
to examine them, nor to read any-
thing she has left on the desk. To
do so is like reading the private let-
ters of another. Therefore, do not
stand beside a teacher’s desk ex-
cept when talking to her.
37. If a lesson is in progress when you
enter the class-room, take your


place quietly to disturb teacher and
class as little as possible.
38. Inattention and idleness in school
indicate a lack of good manners,
and the distinguishing mark of
pupils at a Catholic school should
be their good manners.
39. If visitors come to your class-room
show appreciation of their visit and
exert yourself to the utmost to as-
sist the teacher in entertaining
them pleasantly and courteously.
Be quick to show the visitor little
courtesies like offering a chair.
40. Be ever ready and willing to oblige
your teachers, and readily offer
your apologies for any inconven-
ience or annoyance you cause
them.
41. Speak respectfully of your teachers
to school companions and outsid-
ers. In this way you display loy-
alty and co-operation.
42. Accustom yourself to bear small
troubles cheerfully, and avoid all
tale-bearing. It is despicable to
tell tales on your companions, and
it is disloyal and unworthy to tell
tales about school in the home.
43. Do not forget your daily Visit to
the Blessed Sacrament.


44. While you are at school, cultivate
a feeling of gratitude for the work
your teachers are doing for you,
and when you leave, retain grate-
ful remembrances of them and of
your school.
45. Cultivate a hobby. It will, at least,
fill in an idle hour. A taste for
good reading is a splendid hobby.
46. Senior pupils will do well to rea-
lise the great value their school
study will be to them in after life.
47. Independent of the fact that school
makes her an educated woman,
each subject has its own special ad-
vantage for a girl, and increases
her influence for good.
48. The study of religion, with its ap-
plication to everyday life, not only
leads to personal sanctity, but en-
ables a girl to take a part in the
modem crusade of Catholic Action.
In this connection the study of
Apologetics is most valuable.
49. The study of History, Civics and
Economics enables a girl to act in-
telligently as a good citizen.
50. Business Principles and all it im-
plies is invaluable in the business
and commercial world. No girl can


afford to be ignorant of business
usages.
51. Of all secular subjects, English is
the most important. In the Eng-
lish class a girl learns the correct
method of speech, expression, and
of correspondence. She is taught
to value good literature and to re-
ject what is base and unworthy.
Certain aspects of the English les-
son, such as dramatisation, lec-
turettes and debates help her to
gain ease and fluency in conversa-
tion and so take her place with
confidence in social life.
52. Classes in physical culture, danc-
ing and sport improve a girl’s de-
portment and give her grace and
poise.
53. All elements of a truly Catholic
education contribute to a full and
joyous life, enabling a girl to mas-
ter herself, love others, and devote
herself to God, thereby realising
the purpose for which she was
created.


CHAPTER VII.
Personal Habits and General
Behaviour.
1. Strive always to be neat and clean,
but attend to your toilet in the pri-
vacy of your own room.
2. Do not neglect the care of your
teeth and hair. A well-kept head
of hair adds much to a girl’s
appearance.
3. Your finger nails should be kept
clean and trimmed, but should
never be attended to in public.
4. Do not touch your nose, mouth,
ears or hair in the presence of
others.
5. It is impolite to use your handker-
chief more than necessary. Re-
member, too, that a soiled handker-
chief is offensive in the sight of
others.
6. Keep lead pencils away from your
mouth.
7. Yawning is very impolite. If ob-
liged to yawn, turn away your head
and cover your mouth.
8. Try to avoid coughing or sneezing
in the presence of others.


9. Do not wear your dressing-gown
and slippers in any company.
10. Do not make yourself over-familiar
with anyone by nudging, etc.
11. It is a gross offence for a girl to
wink. Winking is essentially vul-
gar.
12. Avoid a slovenly gait. Walk erect
and firmly with ease. Dancing and
physical exercises give a girl a
graceful deportment.
13. The correct sitting posture is an
upright one, with the knees neither
too close together nor too far
apart, feet neither stretched out
nor drawn in.
14. The feet should not rest on the
rungs of a chair. Neither should
the chair be tilted.
15. Do not select the best chair in the
room for yourself.
16. Take care not to sit with your back
to any of the company. If you find
yourself so placed, change immed-
iately, offering a brief apology.
17. No member of a company should
sit while others are standing, nor
stand while others are sitting.
18. When sitting before the fire, do not
place yourself in front of others,


nor show disregard for their com-
fort.
19. Noise is offensive. When opening
or shutting doors or windows, or
raising Venetian blinds, etc., do so
gently. In moving a chair, lift it.
Do not drag it.
20. Always treat with care the property
of others, books, pictures, etc. Do
not turn down the comers of the
leaves of books.
21. Do not borrow books unless you
can return them promptly.
22. Do not toss articles to anyone,
nor rush to pick up an article.
Never throw anything out of a
window.
23. If someone drops a handkerchief,
it is polite to call attention to it,
except in special circumstances
where you may pick it up.
24. When you receive or hand any-
thing to a superior, always make a
slight bow.
25. Do not leave doors open that were
previously shut, nor walk into a
private apartment without knock-
ing.
26. Open doors for people older than
yourself, and offer them chairs


when they enter a room in which
you are.
27. Courtesy requires that you never
offer your hand to older or more
distinguished people; wait for them
to make the offer.
28. When talking or listening to any-
one, do not fiddle with any object.
Hands should be quiet unless oc-
cupied.
29. Consideration for others demands
that you suppress a yawn or the
smallest sign of weariness when in
company, and that you give your
entire attention to anyone speak-
ing to you, even if that person is
talking lengthily on an uninterest-
ing subject.
30. Little acts of thoughtlessness, such
as allowing a swing door to fly
back in the face of one who is fol-
lowing you, show lack of good
manners.
31. It is bad manners to stand by and
listen while others are talking, or
to listen while another is talking at
the telephone. Move away.
32. When obliged to leave a group or
person with whom you have been


conversing, politeness requires that
you should ask to be excused.
33. To laugh at the mistakes of others
is very ill-mannered.
84. Life would run much more smooth-
ly if we cultivated the habit of ex-
pressing our thanks for the little
services that others do for us.
35. Be always ready and glad to help
and oblige others and exercise tact
which makes everyone feel at her
best.
36. Do not be “thin-skinned” and
easily offended, but acquire a cheer-
ful and pleasant disposition that
will enable you to pass unnoticed
a rude remark calculated to offend.
37. One of the greatest tests of a girl’s
good manners is the way she treats
elderly people, especially if they are
poor and shabbily dressed.
38. By guiding a feeble or timid elderly
person across a street, helping her
to a car, or carrying a heavy parcel
for her, a girl shows that she is
worthy of her Catholic training.
39. An impolite girl often neglects to
thank a boy or man who has shown
her courtesy, such as giving her his


seat in a tram or a railway car-
riage.
40. Offer your help readily to others in
case of illness or accident.
41. Be as courteous to people in
humble circumstances as to the
rich and socially prominent.
42. Be as cheerful as possible at all
times. It is both womanly and con-
siderate to be cheerful in spite of
sorrow, trouble, or the little irrita-
tions of life.
43. Do not write an inscription in a
book you are giving as a present
unless the recipient express a wish
that you do so.
44. Do not present a photograph of
yourself to any person outside your
own family unless specially re-
quested to do so by an intimate
friend. This does not apply to
snapshots.
45. Selfishly to monopolise the most
comfortable chair, to retain the end
seat in a car or the outside end of
a pew in the Church, thus causing
others the inconvenience of crush-
ing past, are marks of bad man-
ners.


46. A well-bred self-control enables a
Catholic girl to refrain from laugh-
ter at the expense of another, to
hold back the clever retort that will
give pain, and to avoid staring at
any unhappy deformity.
47. Anyone with a physical defect is
always conscious of it and sensi-
tive about it, therefore it is rude,
cruel and unchristian to remark on
it to them, or to draw the attention
of another to it. Personal re-
marks are always ill-mannered.


CHAPTER VIII.
In Public.
1. Do not jostle people in a crowd,
nor rush in front of others to se-
cure a better seat in a car or car-
riage. Stand aside and allow those
who are infirm or older to precede
you.
2. In a crowded tram or ’bus, always
rise to offer your seat to a person
much older than yourself, to a
cripple, an invalid, or a mother
carrying a child in her arms. Be
ever ready to help the feeble, the
cripple and the old.
3. Do not try to enter a carriage,
ferry-boat, hall, etc., until those
who are leaving have actually done
so. All haste and bustle are vul-
gar.
4. In travelling on trams, etc., have
the fare ready before the conduc-
tor arrives.
5. On a train, tram, etc., do not oc-
cupy more space than is yours by
right. If others wish to enter the
compartment in which you are, do
not pretend there is no room for
them if such is not the case. Re


member that the compartment be-
longs to them as much as to your-
self.
6. When travelling by rail, etc., a
gentleman allows the lady he es-
corts to enter the carriage first, but
he alights before her.
7. If you are obliged to wait in a rail-
way station, avoid loud talking,
laughing, or parading about.
8. Do not talk about personal affairs
in trams, trains, etc., and avoid
gossip.
9. When travelling with others beside
intimate friends, do not speak about
acquaintances in a tone which may
be heard by other than those with
whom you are conversing. It is
unwise to mention names at all.
10. As you should not raise your voice
in public for those to whom you
are not conversing to hear what
you say, neither should you whis-
per as though you feared to be
overheard. Speak naturally to
those to whom you are addressing
your remarks. If others are pre-
sent, they will be concerned with
their own affairs only.


11. Avoid incommoding other passen-
gers by crowding up the railway
carriage with luggage. The van is
the place for luggage. Take only
a very moderate amount into the
carriage.
12. Do not be too unbending to those
you meet in travelling. Show them
courtesy without entering into
familiar conversation.
13. If a fellow traveller gets out at a
refreshment station, do not take
his or her place.
14. If the rights of fellow travellers
clash with your own personal pre-
ferences, observe the Golden Rule
“Do as you would be done by.”
15. Attracting attention to oneself by
talking or laughing loudly in pic-
ture-theatres, concert-halls, trams
or trains is both vulgar and incon-
siderate.
16. If you are in doubt when travel-
ling, apply for information to a
uniformed attendant.
17. Do not fail to thank anyone who
has given up a seat to you or per-
formed any service for you. Make a
slight bow as you offer your thanks.


18. Girls travelling to and from board-
ing schools either bring credit or
discredit on their school by their
good or bad behaviour. The same
applies to day-scholars travelling
to and from school by tram, ’bus,
or train.
19. Do not pass Immediately in front
of anyone. If obliged to do so, ask
to be excused.
20. A lady does not eat fruit or sweets
in the street.
21. Avoid silly, giggling ways, and do
not stare at people, nor gaze after
them in the street.
22. Girls should avoid kissing or em-
bracing each other in public. Pub-
lic display of affection is bad form.
23. Well-mannered girls do not stand
to converse in the street, except the
conversation is very short. They
should walk along together if they
have anything to say.
24. In walking two together, the per-
son whom we wish to respect
should be on the right or on the
inside of the walk.
25. In walking with a gentleman in the
daytime, a girl does not take his
arm.


26. In walking three abreast, the centre
is the position of honour.
27. In passing Priests, Sisters, or
elderly persons, give them the in-
side of the walk.
28. In greeting friends, acquaintances,
etc., “How d’you do?” is the cor-
rect form.
29. In passing acquaintances whom
one wishes to recognise, the lady
takes the initiative by bowing first
to a gentleman.
30. The primary rule on any public
thoroughfare is “Keep to the left.”
31. Do not inconvenience others by
walking three or four abreast,
throwing fruit skins on the pave-
ment, allowing one’s parasol to
catch in another’s veil, etc.
32. When in doubt about a direction,
apply for information to a police-
man.
33. Do not throw paper or any rubbish
into the street, but place it in the
receptacle provided.
34. It is ill-mannered not to keep ap-
pointments or to be late for them.
If you are truly courteous, you will
be punctual at all times. Pun©-


tuality is equally necessary in the
family circle, at school, in social
life, and in business.
35. Offer your apologies to anyone
whom you may have put to incon-
venience.
86. Dignity of carriage and manners
should always be preserved in pub-
lic.
87. It is inconsiderate to block the pas-
sage of others in doorways, pas-
sage-ways and stair-ways.
38. If narrow stairs are to be ascended,
the lady goes first, the gentleman
following immediately behind. In
descending, the gentleman walks
first to assist when the bottom
step is reached.
39. When two people go up the stairs
together, the weaker should b«
near the baluster.


CHAPTER IX.
Introductions.
1. Be ready to introduce people to
your friends or your friends to them
if you think the introduction will
give mutual pleasure.
2. There is a correct procedure In
making introductions.
8. Persons inferior in age or rank are
usually introduced to those super-
ior in any respect. A gentleman la
introduced to a lady. A visitor is
introduced to a hostess, not the
hostess to a visitor. Priests have
people presented to them, both
men and women.
4. The name of the person who is be-
ing introduced is mentioned first.
Thus in the case of hostess and
visitor the name of the visitor is
mentioned first, “Miss 8., Mrs. A.”
Similarly, a man’s name is men-
tioned before a woman’s.
5. Those of lesser rank are presented,
not introduced to a celebrity.
6. A girl introduces a friend to her
parents thus: “This is my father
(or mother) Mr. A.’’


7. An introduction is for the purpose
of making people known to each
other, so the most important point
is to pronounce the names dis-
tinctly.
8. On informal occasions an intro-
duction is best made by simply
mentioning the two names, giving
the name of the inferior or younger
person first, as “Miss 8., Mrs. A.”
or “Miss 8., have you met (or do
you know) Mrs. A.?”
9. The imperative form, “Miss 8.,
meet Mrs. A.,” is rather discour-
teous and is, therefore, not used
by people of good taste.
10. A formal introduction is made as
follows: “Mrs. A., may I present
Miss B.”
11. It is a sign of friendliness for any-
one in a superior position to shake
hands with one of lower rank. A
hostess always offers her hand
- when a visitor is introduced.
12. If a gentleman is introduced to a
lady, it is her privilege to offer her
hand if she wishes. She offers her
hand if she is the hostess, or if the
person introduced is a particular
friend of the family.


13. When introducing a younger, less
distinguished, or more intimate
friend to on© who. is older, more
distinguished, or less intimately
known, do not say “I want you to
know my friend,” but “I want my
friend to know you.”
14. It is not necessary to introduce to
each other visitors who meet cas-
ually in the home of a friend. They
should converse with ease and
freedom as if they were introduced.
If introductions are made in such
cases, they should be made in a
casual manner.
15. A girl should rise when another
girl is introduced to her, but she
may keep her seat and bow when
a boy is introduced to her. She
should rise when introduced to a
distinguished or elderly man.
16. Though a girl takes the initiative
in offering her hand, no well-
mannered girl would fail to take a
hand offered, nor show surprise at
the error.
17. When introduced to another, the
courteous girl always makes the
other person feel at ease by enter-
ing at once into pleasant conversa


tion. The introduction is acknow-
ledged by saying “How do you do,
Miss A.?” or simply “How do you
do?”
18. A girl should not become embar-
rassed if she fails to hear the name
of the person to whom she is intro-
duced. She should simply say,
“I’m sorry, but I did not quite hear
your name.”
19. You will acknowledge an introduc-
tion with ease of manner if, in-
stead of thinking of yourself, you
aim at making the other person
feel that you are glad to make her
acquaintance.
20. When a gentleman is introduced to
you it is not good form to say
“I am glad to meet you.” It is the
gentleman who expresses the plea-
sure.
21. If the new acquaintance in taking
leave expresses a hope of meeting
again, the courteous girl will reply
“Thank you.”
22. At the next meeting with a gentle-
man after an introduction, the lady
makes the first intimation of recog-
nition.


CHAPTER X.
Visiting and Being Visited.
1. The distinguishing mark of a lady
is her natural ease of manner,
hence the hostess forgets herself
In her efforts to put her guests at
ease and make them enjoy them-
selves.
2. She treats her guests the way sh®
herself likes to be treated when she
visits.
3. The ideal hostess has that tactful
courtesy which makes others feel
comfortable and happy.
4. There can be no real politeness un-
less sincerity underlies all that you
do and say.
5. Kindly care for the comfort and
pleasure of your visitors, along with
quiet courtesy in conversation, will
make a success of any occasion.
6. The hostess should be ready to re-
ceive her visitors and should give
then a cordial greeting to make
them feel welcome.
7. Unexpected visitors should not be
kept waiting in a room. One re-
ceives friends with a natural ease


in the dress one happens to be
wearing at the time.
8. The courteous hostess offers her
guest the best of everything she
has, the best room, the best place
before a fire or elsewhere, the first
and best of everything at meals,
and so on.
9. Extra trouble is cheerfully under-
taken to make things pleasant for
guests. For instance, some favour-
ite dish may be served for them.
10. If guests are tired after a journey,
we offer them a place to rest if they
wish to do so.
11. Similarly, in warm weather we of-
fer them an opportunity to wash or
bathe.
12. Any guest would appreciate little
kindnesses, such as the offer of a
cool drink on arrival in warm
weather, or something warm, such
as a cup of coffee, in cold weather.
13. Brighten your guest’s room with
flowers and put flowers on the table
at meal-time.
14. Attend to your guest’s luggage,
both on arrival and departure.
15. If your guests are strangers, show
them all the places of interest in
the town.


16. Do not show off before guests. A
polite girl will not show all her
dresses to a guest who does not ask
to see them. If, however, a hostess
has something pleasant to share,
such as a new book, a phonograph
record, or a beautiful garden, this
is a good way to entertain a guest
17. If your plan for the entertainment
of a guest seems distasteful to her,
do not press it.
18. Choose topics of conversation that
will interest a guest most It is
impolite to tell your troubles unless
the guest knows of them and makes
enquiries. Avoid talking of any-
thing likely to offend or hurt a
guest
19. As much courtesy is required on
the part of the guest as on the part
of the hostess.
20. Guests should fall in readily with
the plans made for their entertain-
ment and should show their ap-
preciation of whatever is offered,
rest, entertainment or refreshment.
21. Make arrangements beforehand
with friends with whom you intend
to stay or to dine. Even if you in-
tend only to call on friends, let


them know beforehand or make an
appointment.
22. If you are expected at a distant
place, notify your hostess by ’phone
if you are delayed on the way.
23. A polite girl goes visiting exactly
at the time she is invited.
24. Never take dogs into a reception
room.
25. Greet your host and hostess first.
26. When visiting longer than a day,
it is thoughtful to offer to help the
hostess in some way, such as to
dust a room. Even if not accepted,
such an offer is appreciated.
27. Girls on an extended visit should
take care to be provided with gene-
ral sewing requisites, stationery,
and requisites for the toilet to avoid
borrowing,
28. “Staying visitors” should remem-
ber to greet the members of the
household every morning on first
meeting them.
29. Be careful to adapt yourself and
your habits to the customs of the
home in which you are visiting. Go
to bed when the family does and
avoid disturbing domestic arrange


ments by unpunctuality in meals or
in rising. A well-mannered visitor
is considerate in not giving any
unnecessary trouble.
30. A thoughtful girl takes special care
with other people’s property. Do
not use the telephone nor radio
without permission, and never
move nor change the furniture in
the room assigned to you. Even
when you rent a room, it is not
polite to do this without cour-
teously asking permission of your
landlady.
31. When you return home after stay-
ing with friends, write and thank
your hostess and say how much
you enjoyed your visit. You owe
your friends this courtesy for their
hospitality, so the letter of thanks
should be sent promptly.
32. When a call is made upon a guest
staying with a mutual friend, the
mistress of the house should be
greeted first, no matter how ob-
vious is the fact that the call is be-
ing made upon the guest.
33. Whether you are the hostess or the
guest, be natural and unaffected.
To acquire a natural, unaffected


manner is not an easy matter for
most girls, but let them remember
that the more they forget them-
selves and think only of the hap-
piness of others, the more simple
and natural they will be. The es-
sence of good manners is simplic-
ity and consideration for others.
34. Preparation for social life is an
important part of a girl’s education.
If a girl has the right principles and
the unselfish desire to contribute
to the happiness and welfare of
others, commonsense will guide
her in most matters, especially as
the tendency nowadays is towards
less formality.
86. For more formal occasions certain
rules are observed with which
every girl should be acquainted.
38. Afternoon calls should, generally
speaking, be made between the
hours of 3 and 5.30 p.m. in winter
and 3 and 6 in summer.
37. Do not call on people at inconven-
ient hours, nor prolong your visit
unduly.
38. It is Impolite to knock or ring too
loudly, also to knock or ring more
than twice.


39. After having knocked, stand aside
while waiting for the knock to be
answered.
40. When you answer a ring or knock,
show the visitor into the reception
room and provide her with a chair.
If the visitor is a stranger and does
not immediately state her business,
enquire whom she wishes to see
and ask for name or card.
41. A first call is the initial step in be-
ginning an acquaintance. The
woman of higher rank or longer
residence in the district takes the
initiative.
42. It is very discourteous not to re-
turn a first call
43. A bride may not call on any of her
friends until they have first called
on her.
44. When any cause for congratulation
arises, friends should at once offer
their good wishes in person.
45. Similarly, courtesy requires visits
of condolence or sympathy when
ocaslon arises, but there should be
no hasty intrusion by immediate
visits. Visits of sympathy are us-
ually made within a week. When


cards have been received convey-
ing “thanks for kind sympathy and
enquiries,” it is known that the
family are again receiving callers.
46. A hostess rises both at the en-
trance and at the departure of each
caller, hence the hostess sits close
to the door of the reception room.
47. It is unnecessary for a lady to rise
from her seat when another visitor
is introduced, unless the visitor be
of great social standing.
48. After the hostess has shaken hands
with her caller, both seat them-
selves, the hostess indicating a
chair and saying, “Will you sit
here?” but never anything like
“Please sit down.”
49. If your hostess places a chair for
you, sit exactly where she places
it, as it is the house of the hostess
and liberties should not be taken
with the furniture.
50. Should other callers enter, the
caller present should not leave im-
mediately, lest it might appear that
she wished to avoid the new-
comers. If, however, the visit has
been as long as courtesy requires,
she waits until they are seated,


then rises and takes leave of the
hostess, bowing to the newly-
arrived visitors.
51. If you have occasion to look at
your watch during a call, apolo-
gise for doing so on the plea of
other appointments.
52. When leaving the reception room,
one’s back should never be turned.
When entering, a bow should be
made at the door.
53. Courtesy dictates that you do not
rise to leave after your hostess has
been the last one to speak, but
after you yourself have spoken.
54. Offer your hand on leaving, but not
on arriving; then it is the privilege
of your hostess.
55. When staying at the home of a
friend, do not visit those with whom
your hostess is not on friendly
terms.
56. A hostess should not read a book
or paper in the presence of her
visitors.
57. When visitors are leaving, the hos-
tess accompanies them to the
door, gate, car, or even railway
station.


58. It is well for girls to remember that
usage and custom alter according
to circumstances. Kindness and
neighbourliness may prompt a per-
son to act in a way that would be
in conflict with the demands of po-
lite usage, but the need of the mo-
ment will guide her. Moreover, a
changing mode of life inevitably
brings about a change in formal
manners.


CHAPTER XI.
Invitations.
1. Informal invitations may be given
in three ways, in person, over the
telephone, or by writing.
2. In giving invitations, express your-
self in a pleasant, polite manner,
for example, “Can you come to my
birthday party next Friday, from
three until six o’clock? I’d very
much like you to come.”
3. If people are making a short visit
in your home and you wish to in-
vite them to stay to a meal, you
should express yourself in much
the same way.
4. Invitations over the telephone
should be given as naturally and
as politely as in person.
5. The most important thing In any
invitation Is that you state defi-
nitely the time when the guests are
to come. Mention both the date
and the hour.
6. That a guest may know when it
is polite to leave, the hour or date
when the visit is to end should also
have been mentioned in the invi


tation. Otherwise a guest is em-
barrassed.
7. A formal invitation is always writ-
ten. Formal invitations should be
sent at least two weeks before the
event. Such invitations should be
carefully worded and written in the
third person.
8. Informal invitations may be given
any time before the event, usually
a short time before. But if the in-
formal invitation be written, it
should be sent in time to enable
your friend to reply.
9. In written invitations give your
full address and state briefly all the
facts that your guest needs to
know,
10. If you are staying at the home of
a friend, have the permission of
your hostess before inviting any-
one to visit you.
11. Informal invitations are used for
quiet events and friendly affairs.
Even informal invitations should
give some indication of the size
and kind of party. Guests will then
know how to dress and what kind
of entertainment to expect.


12. Formal invitations are used for
special occasions.
13. All invitations, whether formal or
informal, require courteous replies.
14. Replies should not only be cour-
teous, but definite. Anyone who
gives you an invitation wishes to
know with certainty whether to ex-
pect you or not. If you are not ex-
pected, another may be invited in-
stead of you. Moreover, the hos-
tess wishes to know the number of
guests for whom to prepare.
15. In replying, first express your
thanks for the invitation and then
your acceptance or regrets. In ex-
pressing regrets, state briefly your
reasons for not being able to ac-
cept.
16. Written invitations require written
replies. Replies are written very
much in the same way as the invi-
tations are worded.
17. If you send regrets, be careful not
to accept another invitation for the
same time, unless there is some
special reason which you explain
politely in your regrets.


18. When the invitation is given in per-
son or by ’phone, express your
thanks and either accept or regret
just as you would in writing.
19. If some of your friends receive in-
vitations and you are omitted, do
not be offended. A girl cannot al-
ways invite all her friends to the
same function.


CHAPTER XII.
Conversation.
1. The art of conversation is a most
important social grace. Most of us
talk a great deal to each other
every day, so polite conversation is
an art well worth acquiring.
2. Strive to cultivate correctness of
speech and a direct method of ex-
pression, so that a listener may fol-
low your meaning without strain
or annoyance.
3. Avoid silly, giggling ways and aim
at acquiring a pleasant voice and
a musical laugh. Loud talking and
boisterous laughter are most un-
desirable.
4. Whispering is a breach of good
manners. It may create the im-
pression in the minds of others that
they are the subject of the whis-
pered comments.
5. To be able to entertain and to ren-
der our conversation agreeable to
others we should have our minds
well stored with ideas, particularly
on those subjects which form the
ordinary topics of conversation in
society. Conversation is often dull


and uninteresting for want of suit-
able and pleasing topics.
6. Every girl should be conversant
with current news and the histori-
cal events of the last few years.
7. A very important part of a girl’s
social training is the cultivation of
the art of polite and agreeable con-
versation. The possession of this
art alone is of inestimable value to
a girl as a social asset.
8. For good conversation, a well-
stocked mind is the next essential
after correctness of speech and ex-
pression.
9. To talk well requires as much study
and practice as to excel in music
or painting.
10. No one can talk well whose in-
terests are not many and varied.
Acquire an interest in local and in-
ternational current affairs, reading,
sport, both local and international,
dancing, music and other forms of
entertainment. A girl of varied in-
terests will have the confidence
and social poise that follow from a
well-informed mind.
11. Practical hints for acquiring ease
in conversation of a pleasing type:


Read the newspapers regularly to
be well-informed of current affairs.
Every Catholic girl should read
Catholic newspapers and periodi-
cals to keep in touch with matters
of special interest to Catholics, as
well as to get the Catholic point of
view on current affairs. Some
knowledge regarding prominent
people is necessary for success in
conversation, but let such know-
ledge be pleasant and agreeable,
without any admixture of gossip or
scandal. Cultivate the memory by
storing up anecdotes and clever
sayings of others that may give
point to one’s talk, but such must
be brought into conversation un-
obtrusively.
12. A polite girl will forget herself in
conversation and talk about what
she thinks will be interesting to
others.
13. Topics of conversation will depend
upon the company and circum-
stances. Talk, as a rule, about
matters of common interest. Suit-
able topics are current events,
books, education, sport, science,
art, music, a pleasant holiday, an
Interesting experience, and so on.


14. Certain topics are best avoided in
general conversation, for example,
self, one’s health, family affairs and
troubles, criticism of others, re-
ligion, politics, horrible crimes,
frightful accidents, etc.
15. Talking about oneself is an imper-
tinence. If we are specially asked
about ourselves, it is a different
matter.
16. Avoid talking about your health.
This topic is unpleasant and unin-
teresting. Even if your intimate
friends enquire about your health,
do not reply at great length.
17. In speaking of others, praise rather
than blame, excuse rather than
condemn, and keep quiet if you can
do nothing better. Try to forget the
unpleasant things you have heard
about your friends and repeat only
what is pleasant. Uncharitable talk
is contrary to true politeness.
18. Keep away from partisan subjects
such as religion and politics, and
so lead the conversation as to avoid
anything unpleasant. If a topic
embarrassing or disagreeable to
some member of the company is


introduced, you should turn the
conversation to another topic.
19. Never put direct questions to one
who would rather not be asked. It
is very ill-mannered to ask per-
sonal questions about private af-
fairs or anything likely to hurt or
offend the feelings of another.
20. Personal questions may be very
embarrassing, and there is no need
for us to answer them. We may
simply return an evasive reply.
21. Do not discuss family affairs with
others, as such matters are of in-
terest only to those concerned in
them. It shows ignorance of good
usage to allude to your relatives as
“Mr.,” “Mrs.,” “Miss,” etc. Simply
say “my brother,” “my sister.” But
if not speaking to intimate friends,
refer to their relatives by formal
title.
22. If the person with whom you are
conversing has had a misfortune,
be silent about it unless you are
sure that you can be sympathetic
and encouraging.
23. Address a portion of the conversa-
tion to each member of the com


pany. Do not talk with just one
or two of them.
24. If friends are staying in your home,
be sure to include them in the con-
versation.
25. Mention the subject of conversation
to those who enter the company
during its progress.
26. Do not, in company, talk about
something of which some of those
present do not know anything. If
such a subject must be talked
about, a polite person always ex-
plains it to the one who does not
know about it.
27. Never flatly contradict or dispute
what anyone says. Honesty and
moral courage may demand that,
out of fairness to another person
or to a principle involved, one
should disagree with an opinion
expressed or point out an error, but
this should be done with tact and
moderation and without wounding
or offending others present. Com-
monsense added to tact and cour-
tesy will guide one safely in such
a case. But it is a mark of arro-
gance to be too ready to put others


right where no principle Is in-
volved.
28. Do not interrupt others. If you
make the mistake of interrupting,
excuse yourself at once and wait
until the other person finishes.
29. Be always ready to say “I am
sorry” or “I beg your pardon” when
you have offended in a big or a
little way. Readiness to apologise
for a mistake or a discourtesy is a
distinguishing characteristic of the
truly polite.
30. Be specially courteous when speak-
ing to older people. Never inter-
rupt them. Listen to them most of
the time.
31. Remember that the art of polite
conversation consists as much in
listening politely as in talking
agreeably. Listen to others at least
half the time. It is both conceited
and selfish to talk all the time. If
you have the art of listening well,
you will always be welcome as good
company. Still, there are occas-
ions when you should be able, at
least, to start an interesting topic.
32. When introduced to anyone, begin
to converse at once. If possible,


ascertain a common ground of feel-
ing and so establish confidence. The
latest book, film or game may prove
a suitable topic for the beginning
of a conversation. The weather is
always a polite and safe topic to
talk about and it may easily lead
to other topics.
33. If you are self-conscious and find
it difficult to be at ease in com-
pany, remember that others are not
noticing what you are doing nor
bothering about what you may be
thinking. They are trying to please
others and thinking about their
comfort and happiness. Be atten-
tive to others and you will find that
your self-consciousness will vanish
and you will be calm and self-
possessed.
34. Discussion may illuminate a topic
from various points of view and is,
therefore, always allowable in so-
ciety. Argument, on the other hand,
is not allowable. When your opin-
ion is asked, express it freely, but
be ready to listen courteously to the
opinions of others. Do not contra-
dict, but if the matter is important,
express your dissent in a pleasant
amiable manner, with no attempt


to impose your opinion upon
others.
35. Make the most of any subject of
conversation that is introduced by
others. Their good intentions
should be appreciated.
37. Avoid slang and meaningless ex-
clamations. Slang is the language
of the illiterate, not of refined, edu-
cated people.
38. Try to bring out the best that is in
everyone present, remembering
that a good-mannered person never
intentionally wounds or humiliates
anyone, never permits a mistake to
be noticed if it is possible to shield
the one who makes it. We should,
therefore, avoid noticing in others
a slip of grammar or a mispro-
nunciation. Never be so arrogant
as to correct another for any mis-
take or defect.
39. Be natural, unaffected and sincere
at all times, remembering that
“Politeness is to do and say the
kindest things in the kindest way.”
40. Conversations over the telephone
should not be prolonged. To mon-
opolise a telephone line shows lack


of consideration for the rights of
others.
41. Always treat the telephonist po-
litely.
42. When using the telephone, speak
politely to friend and stranger alike.
43. If you have called a wrong num-
ber, apologise for the extra trouble
caused through your mistake.
44. Similarly, if someone has called
your number by mistake, do not
be rude or impatient.
45. To close the conversation is the
right of the person who has called
up.
46. In calling up, the first thing to do
after getting the number is to an-
nounce who you are and for whom
you are calling.
47. It is most unwise to talk about
private affairs over the telephone.
48. To listen to what others are say-
ing over the telephone is most dis-
honourable.
49. Do not call up your friends too fre-
quently, and never talk longer over
the telephone than is necessary.


CHAPTER XIII.
Correspondence.
1. The matter of correspondence is a
very important one. Probably more
mistakes are made in regard to it
than in any other direction. Great
care should be taken in everything
pertaining to correspondence.
2. Letters of a business or official
nature should be answered prompt-
ly. It is impolite to leave such let-
ters unanswered for several days.
3. Letters of purely friendly import do
not need an immediate answer and
are more correctly left for a week
or two. Until answered they should
not be destroyed, as good form re-
quires that they should be referred
to in answering them.
4. Always use good quality notepaper
and envelopes, avoiding display in
colour and ornamentation. Sub-
dued tints are the best. Use good
black ink and write legibly.
5. A stamp put on aslant or upside
down shows a want of good man-
ners.
6. Use the correct mode of address in
directing envelopes.


7. If the house is numbered, there is
no need to use the name.
8. In addressing an envelope to an
unmarried woman, put Miss B. if
she is the only or the eldest daugh-
ter, Miss Mary B. if there are others
in the family.
9. Married women and widows are not
usually addressed by their own
Christian names, but by those of
their husbands, “Mrs. John Brown,”
not “Mrs. Mary Brown.”
10. Use the correct mode of address in
beginning and ending a letter.
11. In writing to an Archbishop, a cor-
respondent would begin “Your
Grace,” ending “I am Your Grace’s
most obedient servant.”
12. To a Bishop, the form would be
“My Lord,” ending “I remain, My
Lord, Yours very obediently.”
13. When writing to a Priest, begin
“Dear Rev. Father,” or, if you
know him personally, “Dear Father
(Brown),” ending “I remain, dear
Father, Yours respectfully.”
14. If a priest to whom you are writing
is a Parish Priest or a Superior of


a community of priests, you put
Very Rev. before his name.
15. If the priest is Parish Priest, you
place the initials P.P. after his
name. If he is a member of a Re-
ligious Order, you put the appro-
priate initials after his name, such
as C.S.S.R. for a Redemptorist.
16. To ordinary acquaintances “Yours
sincerely” is the correct termina-
tion.
17. For relatives or for those to whom
it applies literally, “Yours affec-
tionately” or “Yours ever” would
be the correct form.
18. In signing one’s name at the con-
clusion of a letter, both Christian
and surname should be put in full,
except to members of one’s family.
Miss should be put in brackets be-
fore the name if the lady is single,
or Mrs. John D. in brackets under
the name if she is a married lady.
19. Letters delivered by hand should
be left unsealed unless sent by a
servant.
20. When sending a social note to a
business address, mark it private.
21. A letter of introduction should be
short and complimentary and


should be given unsealed as a
guarantee of your own good faith.
22. Those to whom letters of introduc-
tion have been given should not de-
liver them in person, but should
send them to the person to whom
they are addressed. The receiver
will then call on the person intro-
duced.
23. Do not give a letter of introduction
lightly, as you lay yourself under
an obligation to the friend to whom
it is addressed.
24. Typed business communications
should be signed in ink by the
writer.
25. When sending a letter to a person
unknown to you, asking for infor-
mation, enclose a stamped address-
ed envelope for reply.
27. Never omit the address and date
from any letter of business or
friendship.
28. Invitations should be answered
within twenty-four hours.
29. If an invitation is formal, the reply
should be formal.
30. If an invitation is in the third per


son, the reply should be in the
same person.
31. Courtesy demands that letters of
congratulation or presents should
be acknowledged as soon as pos-
sible.
32. Express by letter your thanks for
special services or favours.
33. A letter should be so folded as to
show the address of the writer im-
mediately it is opened.
34. In a friendly letter, write as you
would talk. The best letter is a
natural one.
35. In letter-writing, remember first the
interests of the one to whom you
are writing, then put your own
news.
36. Be careful what you write. A let-
ter once despatched is beyond the
control of the writer.
37. Do not make a display of foreign
phrases.
38. Abbreviations, permissible in busi-
ness correspondence, should not
figure in private letters, and slang
should be avoided.
39. If you write on the pages in any
other order than that in which they


naturally run, number each page at
the top.
40. In writing to persons much your
superior, use as few words as pos-
sible.
41. Usually the termination of a letter
comes quite curtly, but it may al-
ways be led up to by some kindly
expression, such as “With kind re-
gards,” “With kind remembrances,”
etc. Avoid phrases beginning with
participles, such as “Hoping to
hear from you soon.” They are too
indefinite.
42. All letters, except those of a purely
friendly import, should possess the
qualities of a good business letter.
In addition to being correct in
spelling, punctuation and para-
graphing, they should be clear,
brief and courteous.
43. The most popular formal ending to
a business letter is “Yours faith-
fully.”
44. Business letters require an “inside
address.” This is put at the left-
hand side before the salutation.
45. In addresses the word “Messrs.” is
used for Firms and Partnerships,
but not for Limited Liability Com


panics. Thus “Messrs. W. Brown
& Son” for a partnership, but “W.
Brown & Son, Ltd.” for a Company.
46. Specimen Business Letter:
72 Wattle Street,
Tundara.
21st July, 1936.
Pellegrini & Co., Ltd.,
541-3 George St,
Sydney.
Dear Sirs,
Yours faithfully,
J. Smith.
47. Correct punctuation is very impor-
tant.
48. A postscript is the place of highest
emphasis in a letter. A postscript
should be short and should empha-
sise a single thought only. The let-
ters P.S. are not necessary at the
beginning of a postscript.


CHAPTER XIV.
Business Courtesy.
1. Good manners are quite as impor-
tant in business as in social affairs.
In business, as in all other spheres
of life, good manners rest on a
foundation of unselfishness and
consideration for others.
2. To be courteous in business it is
necessary to be both pleasant and
brief.
3. Refrain from visits during business
hours to avoid wasting the time of
busy people. Do not, during busi-
ness hours, stop a business ac-
quaintance in the street without
necessity. Business time is most
valuable. An employee should not
receive calls or telephone calls
from personal friends in business
hours.
4. When you have occasion to visit
a business person, introduce your-
self, if necessary, and then state
your business plainly and briefly.
5. The same procedure is correct
when you telephone a place of busi-
ness.


6. If a personal interview is desired,
arrange for it in writing. Business
calls should be brief. The caller
never takes the initiative in shak-
ing bands.
7. When shopping, do not try the pat-
ience and civility of the shop assis-
tants. Show your appreciation of
their services and suggestions. Do
not find fault with what they show
you, haggle over prices, nor waste
their time without any intention of
buying.
8. Take your turn and do not try to
be served before others who have
been waiting longer. If possible,
avoid shopping at the busiest times
when the stores are crowded and
the work of the assistants is diffi-
cult.
9. Avoid handling goods exposed for
sale, lest you damage them.
10. Be careful to keep all business ap-
pointments. Failure to keep an ap-
pointment wastes the time of a
busy person.
11. Do not leave the choosing of a
career until your school days are
over. Seek information about the
occupation that attracts you and


get advice about it from those
qualified to guide you.
12. Take a long view and consider the
future. Blind alley occupations lead
to future disappointment.
13. Many permanent positions are
available for girls. One girl wishes
to be a nurse, another a telephon-
ist, a teacher, a waitress, a shop
girl or an office girl. Whatever your
choice, give careful consideration
to the matter.
14. Be as polite in your work as you
are in social life.
15. Begin the day with a cheerful
“Good morning” and a pleasant re-
mark to your co-workers, and ac-
company your “Good afternoon”
with some friendly wish.
16. Form the habit of friendly co-
operation and cheerfully take a
share of any extra work.
17. Be pleasant and friendly, but avoid
familiarity.
18. Show appreciation of any service
or help you receive.
19. Do not gossip about your fellow-
workers.


20. Do not neglect to apologise if you
inconvenience or disturb anyone.
If another apologises to you for a
slight inconvenience, a smile is suf-
ficient answer.
21. A courteous attitude is a most
valuable asset. Good manners, cor-
rect behaviour, and tact play a
large part in business success.
22. A business girl should give careful
thought to her personal appearance.
Tidiness is essential. Hands and
hair should be clean and neat,
clothes well chosen, becoming, and
of a practical nature. Cosmetics
should be used with discretion and
over-dressing avoided.
23. Do not manicure your nails nor
make your toilet in public.
24. Avoid talking or laughing loudly in
public places.
25. Refrain from taking office supplies
for your personal use.
26. Loyalty to your employers requires
that you do not discuss office af-
fairs outside the office. Regard
business affairs as confidential
27. Business women receive more con-
• sideration than men, but they


should not expect special cour-
tesies.
28. An employee does not rise if an-
other comes to her desk to speak
to her, but she rises when ad-
dressed by the employer or
manager.
29. A woman receiving a business call
from a man need not consider her-
self his hostess. She need not rise
at the caller’s entrance or depar-
ture, but she should listen politely
to what he has to say.
30. A private secretary has special
need of correct etiquette. As she
represents her employer, her posi-
tion is a responsible one. To cap-
ability, she should add dignity and
good manners.
31. The reception clerk acts as the
hostess of the firm and receives
callers courteously.
32. A girl who is unselfish and con-
siderate will be safely guided by
her commonsense on the various
occasions throughout the working
day.


CHAPTER XV.
Dress.
1. Neatness is the most essential re-
quisite. Your clothes should al-
ways be well-brushed, mended, and
free from spots, and your shoes
cleaned and polished.
2. Always dress quietly and unosten-
tatiously, avoiding extremes of
style. To overdo anything is a
mark of vulgarity. Vulgar people,
who are usually ignorant, are often
over-dressed, over-painted, and
over-adorned with jewellery.
3. Dress should never be more pro-
minent than the wearer. If you
have nothing to recommend you
except your frocks, you are to be
pitied.
4. Simplicity is the essential of good
form in dress. Over-dressing is al-
ways a danger.
5. After neatness, suitability is the
next important requisite. A well-
mannered girl always wears a cos-
tume appropriate to the occasion.
6. A girl who is neat, clean, and suit-
ably dressed fulfils all the require-
ments of good manners in dress.


7. Avoid going to school in clothes
suitable only for a party, or going
to work in clothes that are too
fancy.
8. A girl who gives moderate care to
her dress is well repaid. A well-
dressed person is always more at
ease than one ill-dressed.
9. It is within the power of any girl
to avoid vulgarity and slovenliness
and to attain an average standard
of gentility in dress.
10. At home it is better to err on the
side of moderation. We should not
wear our best clothes at home, but
we should be courteous enough to
our family to be neat and clean,
and the home dress should always
be pretty and becoming.
11. In sport, suitability is the essential
requisite in dress, but a girl should
never ape the clothing of boys.
12. For the Church, wear your best
street costume. Church is not the
place for an exhibition of fashion-
able clothes. The dress should be
quiet and not of a kind to attract
attention.
13. For one’s daily work, quiet unob-
trusive frocking is most appro


priate ,but where frocks are in-
tended to stimulate gaiety and add
to the decorative effect, as is the
case with the party frock, delicate
tints or bright, gay colours are
appropriate.
14. Plain clothes that wear well and
do not attract attention are best
for school, work, or business.
15. It is bad manners to wear your best
clothes every day. Moreover, if
they are worn every day, you are
left without anything suitable for
special occasions.
16. Good taste in dress means being
suitably dressed for the occasion.
A bathing costume is good form for
surfing, but not for parading the
street.
17. Evening gowns should always be
modest.
18. Singularity in dress and in the man-
ner of wearing it should be avoided
at all times. No refined girl will
wear clothes that specially attract
attention.
19. Striving to outdo others in dress is
both vain and illmannered.


20. A girl with good deportment and a
graceful walk can wear an inexpen-
sive frock with distinction and
make it look as if it were very
costly.
21. Jewellery should be worn only on
dress occasions. It should always
be artistic in design, moderate in
quantity, and not of a kind to at-
tract attention to itself.
22. Jewellery is little worn by day un-
less it is useful, a wristlet watch,
for instance, or a simple brooch to
hold a collar in place.
23. Avoid cheap jewellery and remem-
ber that the excessive use of any
jewellery is very bad taste.
24. Handsome jewellery is not consid-
ered suitable for young girls under
eighteen years of age.
25. If you wish to appear well-manner-
ed and attractive, take frequent
baths, keep your person clean and
neat, and wear fresh clean clothes.
The pocket handkerchief should be
seen as little as possible.
26. It is equally important to keep
your clothes neatly mended.


27. Dirty fingernails, unbrushed teeth
or untidy hair are in very bad form.
28. A lady’s hands should always look
well cared for and manicured, but
excess is to be avoided.
29. Clean teeth not only improve one’s
appearance, but promote good
health. Brush the teeth carefully
and massage the gums several
times a day.
30. Let your hair become you in its
own way. Brush it till it shines
and gleams. Study how it best be-
comes you.
31. Good taste prohibits the excessive
use of cosmetics, lipstick, etc.
There is a limit to be observed
which no refined girl will overstep.
32. Choose your make-up so that it en-
hances the good looks you already
possess. The over-use of cosmetics,
lipstick, and the plucking of eye-
brows cheapen a girl’s appearance.
33. Never repair your make-up in pub-
lic.
34. Cosmetics should never encourage
slackness in personal daintiness.
No perfume is better than too
much.


35. Catholic girls should prove to a de-
generate world that it is possible to
dress attractively and yet decently.
36. If our Catholic girls wish to be
worthy to have Our Blessed Lady
as their model, they should take a
stand against pagan fashions and
strive to promote purity of morals
and decency of dress.
37. In this way they will be complying
with the wishes of their Bishops
and Priests.
38. A Catholic girl’s standard of morals
should be altogether too high for
the wearing of male attire or semi-
nude styles of dress.
39. Our girls should make public pro-
fession of their faith by conform-
ing, without human respect, to the
teachings of their holy religion.
They should have the necessary
strength and independence to be
leaders in the right, not followers
of the wrong.


CHAPTER XVI.
Recreation,
(a) Dancing.
1. Dancing is one of the most natu-
ral forms of recreation for the
young.
2. A Catholic girl should, above all,
avoid indulging in dances of ques-
tionable modesty.
3. She should be careful never to at-
tract unfavourable attention to her-
self by exaggerated actions.
4. At a public ball a girl’s common
sense will guide her in the matter
of accepting an invitation to dance
from a partner who has not been
introduced to her.
5. At a private party a general intro-
duction is assumed from the fact
of being assembled together under
the roof of a mutual friend.
6. Speak to the hostess soon after ar-
rival at the party. Before leaving,
express to her your appreciation of
a pleasant evening, but do not be
too profuse.
7. Remember that there are others


dancing besides yourself and your
partner.
8. The lady has the privilege of stop-
ping when she wishes. Her part-
ner at once releases her and es-
corts her to a seat. He talks with
her until the next dance is called.
9. It is inadvisable for a girl to ac-
company her partner into the cor-
ridors or out of the building.
10. The time of leaving is decided by
the lady.
11. Withdraw from a ballroom as
quietly as possible to avoid break-
ing up a party.
12. If called away unexpectedly, do not
leave without excusing yourself to
your intended partners for subse-
quent dances.
(b) Sport.
13. Every girl needs some form of re-
creation that will take her out of
doors.
14. Convent girls, generally, are taught
to play outdoor games skilfully,
joyfully and becomingly.
15. Games of all kinds provide excel-
lent opportunities for acquiring the


art of getting on with one’s fel-
lows. They teach self-control, de-
termination, good humour, cour-
tesy, sportsmanship, in fact, almost
all the virtues of good citizenship.
16. The ability to work together is
most necessary. We acquire this
ability in games.
17. Play for the sake of playing rather
than to win. The joy of playing is
more important than the result.
For this reason amateur sport is
far more enjoyable and sportsman-
like than professional sport.
18. You can be a great asset to your
team by encouragement, by gene-
rously helping others, and by main-
taining a sportsmanlike spirit at all
times.
19. Recognise and applaud good play
by either team. This will greatly
improve the spirit between two
schools, two towns, etc.
20. No matter what annoyance is en-
countered, do not show irritation.
Be sure not to lose your temper nor
criticise your fellow-players. Al-
ways control your feelings of either
pleasure or disappointment.


21. It is a sign of bad manners to win
arrogantly or to lose sulkily. Be
modest in victory and generous in
defeat, that is, be a quiet winner
and a cheerful loser.
22. Do not cease your efforts because
you find that you are losing. Play
your best right to the very end.
23. If you lose, always congratulate the
victorious team courteously.
24. To display self satisfaction is con-
trary to good manners. If you win,
do not gloat over the other team.
Let them feel that it was a good
game and that you really enjoyed
it.
25. Do not show ill-feeling or dissatis-
faction towards umpires, but ac-
cept their decisions in a proper
spirit without questioning.
26. The opposing side should be given
the benefit of any doubt that may
occur with regard to the enforcing
of a rule, even though it may cost
you the point in question.
27. Make no excuses for bad play.
28. If you are captain, remember that
a good captain rarely finds fault
with her team.


29. Obey your captain promptly.
30. Be fair and honourable in playing
and ever ready to help others gain
proficiency.
(c) General Recreation.
31. Every girl should have two hob-
bies, one for indoors and one for
out. A hobby is a favourite occu-
pation, especially for leisure hours.
It has many advantages. Not only
does it prevent life from becoming
tiresome, but it inculcates industry,
keenness, initiative, etc.
32. Some interesting hobbies are read-
ing, music, painting, gardening,
philately, photography, fancywork,
etc.
33. A hobby prevents the merely use-
less passing away of one’s leisure
time.
34. If one’s leisure has to be spent
alone, reading is a constant source
of amusement and information.
35. The daily reading of newspapers
occupies a fair amount of our lei-
sure. Do not confine your read-
ing to one paper, but read both
sides of the question. A variety of


newspapers can be found in any
public library.
36. The Cinema has many advantages
and delights, though it is not with-
out disadvantages.
37. In places of amusement we need
to be specially careful of our man-
ners. Neither enter nor leave while
an item is in the course of perfor-
mance. To do so disturbs others
and shows want of consideration.
38. If you have seen the performance
before, refrain from speaking about
it. Those near you do not wish to
know in advance what they are go-
ing to see.
39. Avoid reading aloud the explana-
tions on the screen. Let others
read them for themselves.
40. Do not let papers and programmes
fall on the floor.
41. Listen attentively to the perfor-
mance. Talking, whispering, giggl-
ing, moving noisily, etc., are
breaches of etiquette. They spoil
the enjoyment of others.
42. Show appreciation of the entertain-
ment by clapping your hands, but


not by whistling nor stamping the
feet.
43. If you arrive late, consideration for
others demands that you take a
back seat, if possible.
44. When accompanied, a singer
thanks the pianist at the conclusion
of the song.
45. When you are asked out, appreciate
and reciprocate the efforts made
to entertain you.
46. If requested to sing or play, do not
refuse unless unable to comply, but
respond pleasantly and promptly.
47. A person should not be asked more
than once after a first refusel,
which may arise from diffidence.
48. Stand erect during the playing or
singing of the National Anthem.
49. Carry your religion into your holi-
days. You will be all the happier
through keeping God in sight.


CHAPTER XVII.
Training for Catholic Citizenship.
1. A Catholic girl, after leaving
school, has her obligations to her
neighbour and the State as well as
to God and self.
2. “Love thy neighbour as thyself”
and “Render therefore to Caesar
the things that are Caesar’s, and to
God the things that are God’s” are
two gospel maxims that should
guide a young girl through life.
3. Neighbourliness is essential to girls,
as social beings, and religion ele-
vates this natural tendency to a
virtue. Hence the Church empha-
sises social charity and justice.
4. Religion has influenced every
movement that has preserved and
improved our common civilisation.
5. Sound citizenship and religion go
hand in hand.
6. The great deference and respect
which are shown to women and
girls have been taught by the Cath-
olic Church.
7. The Church has done much for


you; it is now your turn to do some-
thing for the Church.
8. This doing something for the
Church is called Catholic Action.
9. The scope for Catholic Action is
endless. Your school training In
Apologetics will help you defend
your religion when it is attacked
and explain its teachings to others.
10. You need not be impertinent nor
rude in your defence. There is a
polite way of doing everything.
11. Without upsetting your health, do-
mestic or social life, you can do no
end of good.
12. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
should be as unpopular with you
as it has been down through the
ages from the time of Cain.
13. We are all our brothers’ keepers,
and it is to our girls and women
that we look to keep our boys and
men good.
14. The presence in the town of a real
Catholic woman who takes her
place in Church work and social
activities induces other Catholic
women and girls to follow her lead.


15. It should be the aim of every
Catholic girl, after leaving school,
to help others, especially Catholic
girls. This can be done in many
ways. You can let some of your
teachers or school companions
know of a vacancy in business,
teaching, or other position open to
girls and suitable for a Catholic
girl.
16. You can help and encourage a
young girl who has a position away
from home by accompanying her
to Mass on Sundays and introduc-
ing her to the Catholic girls of the
parish.
17. You can throw your influence and
knowledge of sport into the town
Sports’ Clubs and, by your example,
let it be seen that sport does not
interfere with religion.
18. You can take your part in social
work for the betterment of the
town and town institutions and
thus throw the weight of Catholic
influence into civic life.
19. You can study politics, not with a
view to becoming a suffragette, but
to promote sound public policy and
Christian government.


20. Your training at school to keep
your class-rooms, recreation hall,
reading-rooms and playground neat
and orderly fosters civic pride in
town institutions such as libraries,
museums, parks, etc.
21. Catholic women and girls should
not absent themselves from public
functions, provided such functions
are non-sectarian. We should like
to see them, at these gatherings,
prominent by their tactful capabil-
ity, tasteful dress, and good man-
ners.
22. The world takes us at our own
valuation. If Catholic women and
girls are left out of public life, it
is usually due to their own indif-
ference. By this indifference they
lose the opportunity of doing good
for others and forwarding the Cath-
olic position.
23. When helping others in social
work, be cheerful and encouraging.
24. There is nothing so easy as fault-
finding. It requires no capital, sac-
rifice, self-restraint, self-denial or
brains to set up in the grumbling
business.


25. Catholic girls and women should
be neighbourly and ready to give a
hand in times of stress, sorrow and
death.
26. The rigid goodness which does no
wrong, but, at the same time, does
no kind action, is not practical
Catholicism.
27. There is much more in the prac-
tice of Catholic faith than going to
Mass and Holy Communion.
28. Girls who are earning their own
living are bound to contribute to
the usual Church dues. They cheer-
fully deny themselves certain plea-
sures in order to assist Church
work, and their greatest regret is
not to be able to do more.
29. Young wage-earners should avoid
the mistake of spending as little as
possible on food, keeping most of
their income for dress and amuse-
ment.
30. Inordinate love of dress and amuse-
ment is unworthy of a Catholic
girl, and when procured at the ex-
pense of good, nourishing food, it
is the height of folly.


31. A modest demeanour, healthy face,
bright eyes, well-kept teeth and
hair will ever be more attractive
than the most beautiful creation of
dressmaker or milliner.
32. In conclusion, be devout to Our
Lady. She will direct you how to
use your power. She has great
power, and it is as a woman that
she exercises her influence. “She
is, in the Church, the Mother of the
family—the Mistress of the house-
hold of the Faith.”
