The Congregational Church
of
Henley Beach, South Australia
T'HE pioneer place of public worship at Henley, held its first services at the home
of Mr. Thomas Fabian, and later at the home of Mrs. Thompson, near the Henley
Beach Road and ihe former railway terminus. The Rev. J. C. McMiehael conducted
the first service. Subsequent services were taken mainly by the Congregational Lay
Preachers’ Association. Mr. Fabian was made Superintendent of the Sunday School.
In May, 1883, the land on which the Church now stands was purchased; a
building was erected at a cost of £640, and opened for worship in November, 1883.
During ibe pastoral oversight of the Rev. Thomas Hope, the building was enlarged
and a vestry added. In January, 1895, Messrs. Joseph Vardon (afterwards Senator),
Thomas Fabian (City Treasurer, Adelaide), and James Shearing were appointed
Trustees. These gentlemen held their first meeting under a sheoak tree in the Church
grounds, and subsequently watched over the infant cause for many years. In the
early days, the active workers, who laid well the foundation of the Church, included
Mr. W. H. Tite and his daughters, and Messrs. C. R. Hodge, R. M. Steele, J. Leslie
Forss, L. W. Stockbridge, and A. Forden, while the Hindmarsh Congregational Church
exercised a fostering care.
In 1886, a fellowship was formed by Rev. J. W. Jones, of Hindmarsh, the foun-
dation members being Mr. and Mrs. Fabian, Mr. A. Wright, Miss Stanford. Mrs.
and Miss Fielder.
The following ministers exercised pastoral oversight at different periods: Revs.
J. W. Jones, George Williams, Thomas Hope (Pastors at Hindmarsh), D. Milne, Jun.,
W. W. Wilson, and S. Fenton.
The Rev. P. Watson (afterwards of Hindmarsh, now of Brisbane) was appointed
assistant-pastor to the Rev. S. Fenton in 1904. The Church prospered, and Mr.
Watson was called to the ministry in 1905, and continued his successful labor among
the people until 1908. He was succeeded by Rev. F. Priest, who during his three
and a half years’ ministry established a reputation as a preacher. The Rev. D. B.
Ashford was called in August, 1912, and within a short time, seventy-nine members
were enrolled. The seating accommodation in the Church was extended, a hall was
erected for the Young Men’s Bible Class, and a fully-equipped kindergarten for the
children.
The Rev. D. B. Ashford was followed in October, 1915 by the present pastor.


Rev. Wm. Hawke. As a result of his labour among the growing population, and
his personal popularity, the Church was often uncomfortably filled during the
summer, and not infrequently visitors could not obtain seats.
On Wattle Day, 1921, a row of trees, as a memorial to those of our number who
made the supreme sacrifice in the Great War, was planted in the Church grounds.
In 1922, during the ministry of the Rev. Wm. Hawke, the present Church
building was erected and called “The Temple.’’ The foundation stone, of Maccles-
field marble, was laid on November 25, 1922, by Mr. G. S. Wright and Mr. James
Shearing, whose long and devoted service to the cause at Henley Beach was thus
honored. Mr. Shearing, one of the original Trustees, continued to be an active worker
until the home-call came a few years ago. Mr. Wright, who was associated with
the Rev. C. W. Evan, 8.A., in the early days of Stow Church, and later became a
deacon of Manthorpe Memorial Church, is still with us and taking a deep interest
in our work, although a long way past the “three score years and ten.”
THE TEMPLE
“The Temple” was opened for public worship by the Pastor, Rev. Wm. Hawke,
on Sunday morning, August 15, 1925, a red-letter day in our history.
THE BUILDING
The building, octagonal in form, was designed by Mr. C. W. Rutt, F.R.1.8.A.,
who had every reason to be proud of his work, while the contractor, Mr. H Naylor,
did full justice to the design. The beautiful interior is admired by all; the acoustic
properties are excellent; and the seats comfortable, while the memorial windows
and the furnishings of the pulpit and choir add to the artistic effect. In front of the
Choir are the communion chairs and table, in carved oak and maple, the central
chair, a memorial to the late Richard Buttery, being similar in design to a chair of
the fourteenth century, now in Exeter Cathedral, in England. The supporting chairs,
in keeping with the central design, are a memorial to the late James Shearing. The
interior walls are of white Mount Gambier stone, as also is the baptismal font. In
addition to the latter, a baptistery is provided for the use of those who desire baptism
by immersion. The Temple and the original building are divided by folding doors,
and on occasions become one auditorium, seating about 500 people. At the opening
services the whole of the accommodation was required. The opening was marked by
the admission to the fellowship of a large number of new members, and no less than
147 participated in the first Communion,


THE TEMPLE HALL
The Temple Hall is a separate building used for the purposes of the Sunday
School, Young Worshippers League, Gymnasium Clubs, Day School, &c.
THE CHURCH BELL
The church hell, from Hindmarsh Square Congregational Church, which for
many years reminded the people of Adelaide of the hour of worship, has, since the
24th of October, 1926, called the residents of Henley Beach to prayer.
THE PIPE ORGAN
To complete the interior beauty of The Temple, and to enrich the music of
public worship, a pipe organ is much desired. Space for an organ is reserved behind
the pulpit. Some years ago, one of our members donated £25 as a nucleus of a
fund for this purpose, but so far, not much has been added. Here is a golden oppor-
tunity for the erection of a noble memorial that would lend beauty to our worship
for generations to come.
FLORAL DECORATIONS
Owing to the devoted service and artistic taste of the Flower Committee, The
Temple is graced week by week with beautiful flowers.
LOVE OFFERING
In 1927, instead of holding a fair, it was decided to ask for a love offering of
£l5O. The effort was accompanied by weeks of prayer, and the result was a sum
of £166 and much thanksgiving.
FINANCE
Notwithstanding the fact that the new Temple cost several thousands of pounds,
the only debt remaining at the opening was £BOO. This amount has since been
reduced, and now stands at £665, part of which it is hoped will be disposed of at
our Jubilee. As in the case of all other churches and institutions, our income has
declined in recent years, and expenses have had to be reduced, but we know that
many others have fared worse, and we are thankful our burden has not been heavier,


THE WOMEN’S GUILD
The Women’s Guild, inaugurated on June 20, 1917, presided over by the
minister’s wife, has for years been an outstanding feature in the work of the Church.
In addition to other duties, the organizing of socials and fairs is always readily and
efficiently done. The Guild has presented to the Church, in the aggregate, hundreds
of pounds, raised as the result of its efforts. Its success has been largely due to the
able leadership of Mrs. Hawke, willingly supported by the officers and members of
the Guild.

Men’s Class
Leader: Mr. A. C. BRICE
Men’s Class first assembled on the 14th July, 1929, and during its four years
of existence has made steady progress.
One of its important functions is to retain the young men who, becoming too
old for the Sunday School, would probably drift away altogether. The method fol-
lowed is that members prepare and read papers, which are discussed by the whole
class. Thus the work is in the hands of the members.
The Class takes a prominent part in the social life of the Temple. Members
periodically go out and conduct church services for the Congregational Home Mission.
Beginning with a membership of eight, the total is now eighteen.
