THE GREAT BRITAIN
STEAM SHIP.
Composed by JOHN CASHIN, a working man.
You gentlemen of England also mechanics great,
I hope you’ll pay attention to what I do relate:
Excuse me, I’m no classic or any scholar bright,
Yet it’s in plain English these lines may you delight;
In praise of the great steam ship the truth I will explain,
ane was ouiic ai inisiol famed, oity, .Britain is her name.

CHORUS
Three cheers for the Britain, three cheers with three time three,
And for the great mechanics of Bristol famed city.
This ship is built with iron strong, machinery of the same,
Planned by that great mechanic of noble birth and fame,
The gentleman exceeds all plans, as you may plainly see,
Squire Guppie is his name of Bristol famed city.
As paddle wheels caused ships to roil when in a heavy sea,
The water holds her boxes down caused danger and delay;
When waves do flow one engine stol’d the other try to work;
And if the steam gets full extent her cylinder is sure to hurst.
Such noise attend those.paddle wheels when on the hrimy sea,
Prevents each jovial passenger from any mirth or play:
Such mistakes caused hearts to ache, as you may plainly see,
But Guppie found a better plan at Bristol famed city.
To throw off this danger and this noise brave Guppie thought he’d do,
To work this monster well built iron ship constructed the grand screw ;
This screw works her with such great speed against both wind and sea,
She crosses the Atlantic ocean without danger or delay,
She will cause no obstruction at pastimes or at play;
Was she to cross the Bay of Biscay they may take their punch or tea;
Were you to sail the ocean wide her equal you wont see,
She is the style of Britain’s Isle and Bristol famed city.
In describing the rigging of this great ship I hope to be excused,
1 am not skill’d in sailors’ work though many leagues I cruised;
As ships in gails lost masts and sails and olten sent adrift,
But the Britain’s is a better plan they made them for to shift,
She has six great masts with yards and gaffs her sails to tack and set,
And if the gale blows strong ahead can lower them on the deck ;

The gentleman made this great plan a sea captain bold was he,
Now shows the Yankees how they built their ships at Bristol famed city i
He sailed the seas for many years in good ships he took delight, /v) 5 > i
He cruised about with Nelson and showed Frenchmen how to tight;
The scarlet line he did maintain and to his country was upright,
To his jovial crew he did prove true and acted honor bright;
For valour none could him excel in support of England’s crown,
Frenchmen to him had to give in and pull their colours down;
For art and skill in ship building no man has equaled he,
Brave Captain Clarkson is his name of Bristol lamed city.
Such accommodation in a ship I never saw before,
In her grand saloon there is so much room you could drive a coach and fom;
With grand cabin, bed-rooms, and berth places their epual no man has seen,
For beauty they exceed the palace where dwells our gracious queen;
'There is no hotel can her excel in city or in town.
And thousands came to view her from each country round;
In sailing ships they will go no more since the Britain they did see, •
They called her the moving palace from Bristol lamed city.
Gentlemen all on you I call of those three kingdoms round,
• You merchants of old England that wish to trade with care '
Get your ships all built at Bristol and no danger you need fear
It is one of Uie most splendid factories that ever stood'on ground.
Also the Lest mechanics for ship building to he found;
With great drafts men and lore men brave Armon and Perry too,
Make no delay but come away if you are for America bound.
And mind the days when the Britain sails horn Liverpool to New Yor*.,
She will carry you with ease across the seas without danger or shock, „
The wine glass you can merily pass around in jollity,
And toast to the sons of Britain’s isle and Bristol lamed city. A
To master and man always did stand Honest, upright and true;
With their jolly smiths and boiler-makers their equal you cannot see,
Now shows the Yankees how work is done at Bristol lamed city.
Of all other towns and cities Bristol takes the sway;
In the late war she fought victorious with Nelson on the sea,
Her country’s rights she did maintain upon each battle day,
And sent some valliant ships well maned out to Traffalgar bay.
If war should chance to rise again she is sure to gain the day, .
XI Well MIUIIIU 1/lldiißC LU floe one jo ouic tv gaiu tut tiaj)
For she has the master of all ships upon the raging sea. _ j
Let Parker and Bowles that keeps oil’ England’s foes to Bristol give a call,
And they will build for them such ships to light as fears no cannon-ball, /
Lord Nelson did them always praise they fought so manfully ;
If war again takes place their foes they’ll face—bold Bristol famed city.
Now to conclude and finish these lines which I began,
The captain bold of this great ship is a famous gentleman.
In steam ship trade he takes the lead upon the raging sea,
And commanded the lucky Western that showed steam ships
America;
For seven years it now appears the Great Wester
Across the Atlantic Ocean and never lost a man,
With the Great Britain now the seas he ploughs
Brave Captain Ackins is his name of Bristol lamed city.
Three cheers for the Britain three cheers with three times three,
And for the great mechanics of Bristol famed city.
