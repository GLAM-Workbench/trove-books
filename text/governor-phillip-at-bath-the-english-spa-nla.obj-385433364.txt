Governor Phillip
BATH
The English Spa
Bath, the famous British Spa, has
a special and abiding interest for
Australians, for it was this beautiful
city that the Founder of the Common-
wealth, Admiral Arthur Phillip, first
Governor of New South Wales,
chose, towards the end of his event-
ful life, as his final place of residence.
The city was not unknown to him ;


records show that he had visited it
on more than one occasion since his
return from Sydney, to test, as many
admirals had done before him, the
virtues of the hot mineral waters for
an impaired constitution.
Founded by the Romans in the
First Century and developed through
the ages as a great health centre,
Bath has enjoyed Municipal Govern-
ment for over a thousand years.
Phillip came to Bath in 1808 for
rest and retirement. His XVIIIth
Century house in Bennett Street was
not a stately mansion, but such a
residence as appealed to him for
quiet comfort, and although built
nearly two hundred years ago it still
remains unaltered either externally
or internally.
The fashionable whirl of the
XVIIIth Century, presided over by
the famous Master of Ceremonies,
Beau Nash, with all its frivolities
and vices, had passed away, giving
place to a more intellectual type of
resident and visitors who were con-
tent with more sober forms of
recreation.


Such were Admiral Phillip’s
neighbours. There were other dis-
tinguished admirals resident in the
City —Admiral Sir William Hotham,
who, with Hood, fought at Camper-
down ; Viscount Bridport, who died
at Bath in 1814; Admiral Jervis,
afterwards Lord St. Vincent, who
was a great sufferer from gout,
besides many naval officers of lesser
rank. We may picture the exchanges
of visits and imagine the yarns of
early experiences.


Mrs. Siddons had just left for
London, having won herself back
to fame at the Bath Theatre. Jane
Austen, to the regret of all her
friends, had lately left after nearly
completeing her last work.
But Phillip was visited by many
friends of former days who never
failed to seek him and those from
Sydney and far-off lands.
During his latter years he had
become an invalid, and often he
might have been seen in his wheel
chair on the pavements of the Royal
Crescent or the Circus.
One would have expected that
an Empire Builder of such distinc-
tion would have received a public
funeral, but Phillip chose to be
buried not in the ancient Abbey of
Bath, where a memorial to his


memory has recently been erected,
but in the quiet country church at
Bathampton on the outskirts of the
City, with only a few intimate
friends to follow him to his grave
and mourn his loss.
And now, together with Admiral
Phillip’s house in Bennett Street
and the Memorial in the Abbey,
Bathampton has become a place of
pilgrimage for Australian visitors
to England.
There are public-spirited citizens
of Bath who gladly give their leisure
to show strangers some of the
interesting features of the City, and
Australian visitors who desire to
avail themselves of the services of
these honorary guides should apply
at the City of Bath Information
Bureau.
