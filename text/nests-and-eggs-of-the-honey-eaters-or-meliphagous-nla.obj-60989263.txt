The first Blood Honey-eaters noticed in Victoria, which are in
the National Museum, Melbourne, were shot by Mr. C. J. Stafford
in Gippsland. By way, I may mention that Mr. Stafford was a
mate of the late Mr. H. W. Wheelwright (“Old Bushman”), who
wrote “ Bush Wanderings of a Naturalist.”
Mr. F. Hutchinson sent to the Australasian office for identifica-
tion a sketch of a pair of Blood Honey-eaters, which were observed
feeding among the blossoms in his garden, Alexandra, Victoria,
22nd September, 1896. The beautiful birds were interesting
visitors indeed, being so far out of their usual track, and so early
in the season.

found in Northern Australia, where it seems to be exclusively
confined to the extensive beds of mangroves bordering the inlets
of the sea, as we learn from Gilbert.

Geographical Distribution. —Northern Territory, Queensland
(probably), New South Wales, Victoria, South and West Australia.
Nest. —Cup-shaped, oval, shallow; composed of dried grasses,
fine shreds of bark, &c.; usually placed in an exposed situation in
the forked branches of a bush or tree (Gilbert).
Eggs. —Clutch, 2 ; roundish or round oval in shape, slightly
pointed at one end ; texture fine; surface slightly glossy; colour,
delicate salmon-pink or flesh tint, blotched and spotted chiefly
round the apex with reddish-brown or chestnut and dull or light
purple. Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch—(l) -67 x -54;
(2) -67 x -53.
Observations. —The range of the splendid little Black Honey-
eater extends across the southern part of Australia, Gould having
found it on the plains of the Namoi, while Gilbert met the species
amongst the Myalls ( Acacia) in Western Australia.
The interesting species wmuld, however, appear to be more
peculiar to inland parts. In October, 1884, I met the Black


Honey-eater in the Bull-oak ( Casuarina) belts of timber that
intersect the Mallee country in the Wimmera district, Victoria.
The prettily-contrasted black and white plumage of the male
agreeably harmonised with the surroundings. The flight of the bird
at times is peculiar, being spasmodic rises and falls. On each
downward motion a tremulously plaintive note is uttered. I was
convinced by the actions of several pairs of birds that they were
breeding in the vicinity ; but my perseverance, which extended
over several days, failed to discover a nest, although good Gilbert
told us their nests were usually placed in most conspicuous situa-
tions. One he found in Western Australia was in a fork at the
top of a small scrubby bush, not sheltered even by a bough or leaf,
while a second one was on the dead branch of a fallen tree, in a
similarly exposed situation.
Mr. Chas. French, junr., on learning of my desideratum , at once
kindly placed a pair of eggs, together with a skin of one of the
parents (the male), at my service. All were secured in the
Wimmera district, 15th September, 1896.
The late Mr. K. H. Bennett informed Dr. Bamsay that he had
found the Black Honey-eater plentiful near Mossgiel, N.S.W.,
feeding among the Sandal-wood ( Myoporum ) trees. Mr. Bennett
succeeded in finding a nest with two eggs, but no data are given.
During the progress of the unfortunate Calvert Exploration Ex-
pedition, 1896, it is recorded that on the 2nd October the deceased
explorer, Mr. C. F. Wells, shortly before he perished in the “lurid
waste-lands, pent in silence, thick with hot and thirsty sighs,”
found a nest of the Black Honey-eater, which flushed from a Ti-tree
(Melaleuca) bush as he passed. The nest and its single egg were
left at the abandoned depot in the desert.
Breeding months, September or October to December.

Geographical Distribution. —North-west Australia, Northern
Territory, and North Queensland.
Nest and Eggs.' —Unknown.
Observations. —“ The present interesting bird,” writes Gould,
“ was forwarded to me by Bynoe, as having been shot by him on the
north coast, but to my regret it was unaccompanied by any infor-
mation whatever respecting its habits.” Nor has any information
regarding the species been obtained up to the present time except-
ing Mr. G. A. Keartland’s north-west remarks made during the
ill-fated Calvert Exploration Expedition, 1896-7. He says, “At
the well near our camp on the telegraph-line near the Fitzroy
River these pretty little birds were occasionally seen and specimens


obtained. They were also found in considerable numbers at Derby
in May, where the blossom afforded them an abundant supply of
food. Though the adult males are decidedly black and white,
several of those shot appeared to be immature, and had old brown
feathers dispersed through the black. I have reason to believe
that the young birds of both sexes are plain dark-brown above and
pale-brown or dirty-white beneath. What appeared to be adult
females corresponded in plumage to the young ones. A deserted
nest of this species bore a strong resemblance to that of M. nigra y
but was lined with a few bits of horse-hair.”

Geographical Distribution. —Northern Territory and Queens-

Nest. —Cup-shaped, small, frail ; composed of fine brownish

inches by 2 inches in depth; egg cavity, 1| inches across by
1| inches deep.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2 usually ; oval, compressed at one end ; texture
fine ; surface slightly glossy ; colour warm-white, spotted chiefly
round the upper quarter with reddish-brown or chestnut and
purplish-grey. Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch—(l)
•66 x -5 ■ (2) -62 x -5.
Observations. —This obscure-coloured Honey-eater would also
appear to be an obscure species. It is confined to Northern Australia.
The 13th August, 1885, on Hinchinbrook Island Northern
Queensland, I found a nest of this species being built in the man-
groves, but, unfortunately, I had to leave that interesting collect-
ing ground before the nest was completed.
Mr. Dudley Le Souef states a nest of the Dusky Honey-eater
was found on 23rd October, 1893, during his visit to Mr. Hislop,
Bloomfield River district. The nest was well shaded by foliage
near the top of an Ironwood (Eucalypt) tree about 30 feet from the
ground. One of the parents was secured.
Another nest containing two eggs was taken by Mr. R. Hislop,
17th October, 1895.

Geographical Distribution. —Queensland, New South Wales, Vic-
toria, South Australia, Tasmania, King Island, and Furneaux Group.
Nest. —Cup-shaped, small, deep; composed outwardly of moss
chiefly and bark; inside lined with grass, finished off warmly with
feathers ; usually placed in a thick bush such as Prickly Acacia or
among the close branchlets of a Banksia, Exocarpus , or near the
top of a ti-tree ( Melaleuca ). Dimensions over all 34 inches by 2
inches in depth; egg cavity If inches across by inches deep.
Eggs. —Clutch 2-3 ; somewhat lengthened in form; texture
fine ; surface slightly glossy ; colour pale buff, delicately spotted,
especially about the apex, with chestnut and obscure purplish-
grey. Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch—(l) ’75 x -57 ;
(2) -74 x -55.
A set from Tasmania are larger, rounder, and the markings of
a richer brown, the ground colour being also a darker shade on
the apex ; (1) -72 x -53; (2) -72 x -53; (3) -72 x -52.
Observations. —This ruby-eyed, slender-billed Honey-eater enjoys
chiefly a southern habitat. It is an intensely interesting and
familiarly known bird in our gardens, where it may often be heard
repeating faster and faster its single high-pitched note, and where
the bird appreciates the nectar of the Fuchsia bells just as well
as the sweets from tubular blooms of Epacris growing in native
heath-like tracts.
Not much is known of the breeding economy of the little Spine-
bill, consequently their eggs are deemed rare. Except one nest
containing young found many years ago at Toorak, near Melbourne,
I was unable to observe this Spine-bill’s nest in the open till one
day (20/11/96), when Mr, G. E. Shepherd, my son, and myself
were exploring an enchanting gully near Somerville. Here we
discovered in the space of about half a mile three nests—two
building, and one with eggs. One nest was prettily ensconced in
a bunch of flowering Clematis at the top of a Ti-tree ( Melaleuca).
This nest was subsequently revisited by Mr. Shepherd, who found
in it an egg of the Spine-bill, together with the much larger egg of
the Pallid Cuckoo (G. pallidus). The Spine-bills sometimes build
near the flowering Mistletoes [Lorantfocs), upon which they feed.
Ornithologists are divided whether the Tasmanian Spine-bill
should be separated from the mainland species or not. However,
as Gould pointed out, although very nearly allied, there is a differ-
ence in the two birds, the Tasmanian variety being distinguished
by its smaller size (which is the reverse of the general rule as
regards the insular representatives of the mainland species) and
by the much deeper colouring of the crescent-shaped markings on
the neck, also of the brown on the abdomen.
The nests found by Gould, both in Tasmania and on the main-
land, were built in low shrubs a few feet from the ground, mostly
in a species of Leptospermum.


The following is a description of a Tasmanian nest :—Cup-
shaped, deep; composed of wool chiefly, grass, and moss; inside
lined with feathers. Dimensions over all about 3 inches by 24
inches in depth; egg cavity 2 inches across by 1| inches deep.
Mr. A. E. Brent has usually found them in a bushy shrub, such
as Mimosa “Box” or Wattle-trees. He has also found the unusual
complement of four eggs in a Spine-bill’s nest. He also recollects
taking a Tasmanian Spine-bill’s nest with three eggs, and within
three weeks the bird had rebuilt the old nest twice in another
position in the same tree, laying each time another set of three
eggs. The curious part of the affair was that the succeeding sets
were much lighter in colour, the last being almost white, with a
few faint spots. Here may be a hint on egg-colouration, in which
it appears that in eggs produced frequently and rapidly the colour
pales out.
Breeding season, August or September to January; the chief
months, both in Tasmania and on the mainland, being October to
December.

Geographical Distribution. —South and West Australia.
Nest. —Cup-shaped, neat, compact, round; composed chiefly of
rootlets enveloped with strips of bark matted with spider’s web ;
insidp lined with the dark red downy substance of Banksia cones
or with Zamia wool, fur, &c, ; usually placed in a bush or low
tree such as a Banksia. Dimensions over all 2| inches by 2 inches
in depth ; egg cavity 1|- inches by 1| inches deep.
Fggs.—C\ntc h, 1-2 ; lengthened in form ; texture fine; on
surface faint trace of gloss; colour pale buff or soft pinkish-white,
darker on the apex, finely spotted, more particularly on the apex,
with chestnut and dull purplish-brown. Dimensions of single
examples in parts of an inch—(l) -78 x -52 ; (2) -75 x -53.
Observations. —There is no mistaking the fine, little western
Spine-bill, with its white eyebrows. Mr. Wm. White, of South
Australia, informs me he has identified this species as far eastward
as Kangaroo Island, where he took several nests. Therefore it is
on his authority that I have given South Australia as a habitat of
the bird.
Gould has described detail the nest, stating that the eggs are
two in number. Possibly that may be the number laid at the
height of the breeding season ; but at the beginning of the season
I found one only. On the Ist October, 1889, at King George’s


Sound, I discovered two nests of the White-browed Spine-bill
building, and watched them carefully. A single egg each was the
result. Another nest I found had also a single egg, slightly
incubated ; while a fourth nest, found on the 7th, contained one
young bird. Three nests out of the four were situated on a small
prickly-leafed variety of Banksia at a height varying from 5 to
8 feet from the ground.
I often watched the birds with merry chirrup chasing each
other round the trees ; the noise of their wings as they flew past
me made quite an audible sharp “ purrt, purrt, purrt ” sound.
Breeding months probably include September to December.

Geographical Distribution. —South Queensland, N. S. Wales,

Nest. —Cup-shaped, small, but long or deep; composed of soft
shreds of bark, matted outwardly with cotton-like substance,
cocoons, portions of moss, grass, &c.; inside lined with mixture of
soft vegetable matter such as rootlets, small leaves, &c., in other
instances chiefly with soft reddish-coloured bark, and sometimes
with fur or hair; usually situated at a good height from the ground,
suspended in a swaying branch of a Eucalypt or among the top-
most branches of a tall sapling. Dimensions over all 2| inches
by 2-3 inches in depth; egg cavity 1|- inches across by l|-lf inches
deep.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2-3 ; oval, compressed towards one end; texture
fine ; faint trace of gloss on surface ; colour delicate or pale buff,
marked chiefly round the apex with reddish-brown or chestnut and
dull grey. Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch : —(1) ‘76
x -51 ; (2) -76 x -51 ; (2) -75 x -5.
Observations. —This species of Honey-eater is a delightful and
familiar little creature, and its plaintive half-whistling, half-hissing
note is well known when heard amongst the “ forest rafters.” It
is a pretty sight to see the birds clinging to and feeding amongst
a cluster of flowering Loranthus (Mistletoe).
The habitat of the Lunulated or White-naped Honey-eater is
very extensive, extending from Southern Queensland round to
South Australia. It is interesting to note that this Honey-eater
was found on Kent Group, Bass Straits, by the expedition of the
Field Naturalists’ Club of Victoria, November, 1890.


Within its usual boundaries the bird is fairly plentiful. I
recollect there was something akin to an irruption of this bird
once in the vicinity of Melbourne, notably in gardens at Windsor.
It occurred about the season 1866, when I remember particularly
the so-called Cape Wattles (but really a south-west Australian
variety of Acacia or Albizzia, from whence it was introduced
into Victoria by the late Baron von Muller) being crowded with
birds feeding amongst the flowers. As boys, we had no difficulty
in “ shanghaing ” as many as we wanted, and that was so long as
the poor birds remained in the trees to be aimed at.
The nest of the Lunulated Honey-eater is not only difficult to
get on account of the height at which it is usually buih, but because
the clever little bird often swings it at the end of a slender bough.
However, I once found a beautiful nest suspended almost within
reach in the overhanging branch of Black Wattle (Acacia).
Mr. C. C. Brittlebank tells me when he wishes to take one of
these nests in a difficult position he always selects a windy day for
the purpose, then chops the bough containing the nest oft'. The
poor bird remains closely to its charge, supposing, no doubt, that
the elements are merely a trifle more boisterous than usual. The
coveted prize is safe, and within reach before the dear, deluded
bird realises the position of affairs, when it somewhat hurriedly
leaves its cosy nest and delicate flesh-tinted eggs to the cause—
well, let us say—of science.
Gould found examples of the Lunulated Honey-eater breeding in
a state of plumage which he believed to be characteristic of youth.
It is just possible that Gould mistook M. brevirostris for the young
of M. lunulatus.
There are eggs of the Lunulated or White-naped Honey-eater
in the Dobroyde Collection, taken as early (in a double sense) as
June, 1859, and July, 1861, respectively. Mr. Brittlebank has
taken them as late as the 14th*, 18th, and 27th January respec-
tively, therefore the extreme limits of the breeding season may
be stated as from June to January, the chief months being
September to November.
The Pallid Cuckoo is very partial to the nest of this little
Honey-eater as a receptacle for its egg.

Geographical Distribution. —West Australia.
* This nest was lined with white flowers.


Nest. —Usually suspended from small branches near the top of
gum-trees ( Eucalypts ), where the foliage is thickest, which renders
it difficult to detect. A nest found by Gilbert in October was
formed of sheep’s wool and small twigs; another found by him in
November was attached to a small myrtle-like tree in a thick gum
forest, not more than 3 feet from the ground (Gould).
Eggs. —Clutch 2-3 ; deep reddish-buff, thinly spotted all over,
but particularly at the larger end, with dark reddish-brown, some
of the spots being indistinct, while others are very conspicuous.
Dimensions 91- lines (-79 inch) by 6 lines (-5 inch) —(Gould).
Observations. —This western Melithreptus is closely allied to M.
lunulatus ; some authorities say they are identical, but, as Gould
points out, it differs from the eastern bird in being larger and
having the naked space above the eye greenish-white instead of
scarlet.
During my own explorations in western woods I expected to
take the eggs. However, I only saw the birds building a nest,
which I could not obtain. It was then the beginning of October.
Breeding season, possibly from August to December.

of soft bark of the Melaleuca (Gilbert-Gould).
Eggs. —Clutch, 2 usually; light salmon-colour, blotched and
freckled with reddish-brown. Dimensions, 9 lines (-75 inch) x 6

Observations. —The White-throated Honey-eater is the northern
representative or sub-species of the Lunulated or White-naped bird
coalescing with each other in southern Queensland. Gilbert found
the white-throated species abundant in the Port Darwin district.
More information would be welcomed respecting its nidification.
I saw what I believed to be fledglings of this species, near
Townsville, Q., 16 Sept., 1885.

Nest. Cup-shaped; composed of fine grasses and bark webbed
together with spiders’ nests (Ramsay); usually suspended in the
forked twigs of a leafy tree.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2—3; inclined to oval, but more compressed at
one end ; texture, fine; faint trace of gloss on surface; colour,
delicate or pale buff, moderately spotted with chestnut and dull
purplish-brown, the markings being chiefly on the apex. Dimen-
sions of a clutch in parts of an inch (1) -78 x -57; (2) *75 x -55.
Observations. —The Black-chinned Honey-eater is one of the
larger species of its genus, approaching next in size to the Strong-
billed Honey-eater of Tasmania. It ranges chiefly over the southern
half of Australia ; but is not usually found in the vicinity of the
coast or in thick forest.
I never recollect identifying this bird in the open; but have
had skins kindly forwarded for my examination from Mr. Wm.
White, of South Australia, and more recently (1896) from Mr.
H. E. Hill, who collected the bird in the Bendigo district, Victoria.
Eggs, however, I received from Mr. H. O. Lang, Dubbo district,
New South Wales. The specimens are somewhat smaller than I
expected to see; but I find Dr. Ramsay gives even smaller dimen-
sions ( i 3 x 55 inches) than those of the specimens I have described.
Gould has only described the nest and eggs by analogy.

Observations. —This fine Honey-eater—the largest of a most
interesting genus—is peculiar to Tasmania and King Island, where
I have myself procured the bird. Gould was indebted to the late
Rev. Thomas J. Ewing, D.D., for the nest and eggs of the Strong-
billed Honey-eater, which he (Gould) failed to find himself during
his sojourn in Tasmania.
I have to thank the Rev. T, H. Hull, of Tasmania, for the first
examples of eggs in my collection, which were obtained during the
season 1874.

Observations. —As Gould states, although very closely allied to
M. gularis, this species is altogether a much more finely-coloured
bird. In size it is slightly larger, and it is at once to be distin-
guished by its white under surface, and the beautiful lemon-yellow
on the back of the neck, as well as by the bright yellow naked skin
surrounding the eye, which part is of a beautiful bluish-green in
M. gularis.
Dr. Sharpe, in referring to Gould’s type of the beautiful and
well-named Golden-backed Honey-eater, is of opinion that it “is
apparently a very old male in full breeding plumage ” of M. gularis.
Many answering to Gould’s type (M. Icetior ) have since been found.
The talented doctor must also be prepared to accept a female as
an “ old male,” since Mr. G. A. Keartland was good enough to
present me with one which he shot in the far north-west, Mr.
Keartland informs me he found the beautiful Golden backed
Honey-eater plentiful on the Fitzroy River from Mount Campbell
to Derby. In May these birds had apparently paired.
News of the nidification of this species is awaited with interest.

Nest. —Cup-shaped, small, neat, composed of grasses or fine
shreds of bark matted together with portions of spiders’ cocoons
greenish and white ; inside lined warmly with a ply of fur or hair ;
usually suspended at the extremity of a Eucalypt branch in open
forest. Dimensions over all 2|- in. by 2 J in. in depth ; egg cavity,

ture fine j faint trace of gloss on surface \ colour, reddish-buff or

splashed with reddish-chestnut, a few specks also appearing here
and there over the shell \ other specimens are sparingly speckled
all over. Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch (1) -77 x -57 :
(2) -76 x ‘56 ; (3) -74 x ’57. An odd example, *72 x •58.
Observations. —Gould was in doubt about the existence of this
species; possibly he mistook it for the youthful M. lunulatus. I
fear he was erroneously informed when he states the characteristic
bare space above the eyes of M. hrevirostris is greenish-blue. From
specimens I have examined immediately after being shot it
should be a delicate flesh tint. The bird is otherwise plainly
coloured, is terribly active, and possesses a disagreeable, rough,
rattle-like note.
While on a collecting trip at Bagshot, Bendigo district, October,
1880, I procured examples of bird, nest and egg. Dr. Ramsay
kindly identified the bird for me, which enabled me to describe
the nest and egg. I have since observed the bird in various parts of
my last recollection of them being on the 25th Septem-
ber, 189/, when I saw a flock of six or seven merry birds feeding
on the pollen, &c., of the flowering cones of a stunted Banksia that
grew on the plains near Mount Cotteril. I was agreeably sur-
prised to notice the Brown-headed Honey-eater in Western Aus-
tialia, therefore its habitat extends across the southern half of
the continent.
On the Bagshot trip already referred to I was accompanied by
Mr. James Peatling, a local farmer. We found Brown-headed
Honey-eaters somewhat numerous, and I succeeded in obtaining
a nest, which was suspended to the extremity of a swaying branch
of a Box-tree (Eucalyptus viminalis). This nest was composed
of grass, thickly woven in and out with wool and fur. The latter
material the birds pull off live animals. We were attracted by
the lively actions of this curious little Honey-eater upon the back
of a native bear (A oala), which had taken up its usual position in
the fork of a tolerably tall gum. The bird was clinging on in
a very comical manner, while busily engaged plucking off a mouth-
ful. of fur. One of our party, also desiring to rob the animal
of its furry coat and of its life—fired, hit the bear, but did not
dislodge it. The discharge, however, merely frightened our little


feathered friend on to a neighbouring branch, and before the gun
was reloaded the bird had commenced operations again on the
back of the bear.
Mr. A. J. North informs us there is in the Dobroyde collection
the nest and eggs of this species, together with the birds shot
therefrom, obtained by Mr. J. Ramsay at Cardington, on the Bell
River, November, 1867. These interesting specimens were, how-
ever, kept dark, and were not described till the “ Catalogue of
Nests and Eggs” appeared, 1889.
November, 1895, Mr. C. C. Brittlebank found a pair of Brown-
headed Honey-eaters building in the bed of the Myrniong Creek
below his house. The birds first attracted his attention by pulling
hair off the cattle. The same season Mr. G. E. Shepherd found
two pretty nests near his nurseries, Somerville, the second nest
being taken on the 3rd January. The following season he found
other two nests, but they each only contained an egg of the
Pallid Cuckoo.
Breeding months, September to January.

Nest. —Cup-shaped, somewhat deep and pointed at the base,
with thick bulging sides, composed of wool chiefly, moss, and
spiders’ cocoons, with a few threads of stringy-bark round the
rim ; inside warmly lined with fur and feathers ; usually suspended
in the tender foliage at the extremity of a pendulous branch in a
stringy-bark (Eucalypt) sapling or tree, where it is difficult to
detect. Dimensions over all 3 inches by 4 inches in depth ; egg
cavity 1|- inches across by 1| inches deep.

texture fine ; surface, slightly glossy ; colour, delicate flesh tint,
marked moderately, and chiefly about the apex, with well defined
spots of rich reddish-brown, or chestnut and purplish-brown.
Resemble those of M. validirostris, but are proportionately smaller.
Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch (1) -78 x ’57 ; (2) ‘7B x
•57 ; (3) -76 x -56.
Observations. —This interesting Honey-eater, with its head
entirely black, is peculiar to Tasmania and King Island, where
specimens were procured by the expedition of the Field Naturalists’


Club of Victoria, 1887. It may possibly be found on the Furneaux
Group, although we did not notice it there during a subsequent
trip, being engaged chiefly amongst the sea-birds.
During my Tasmanian excursion (1883) I was much delighted
at the lively prying actions while searching for food of both the
Strong-billed and Black-headed Honey-eaters; the latter also
possesses quite a cheerful little song. I endeavoured persistently
to discover their nests, but only found fully-fledged young of the
Strong-bill, which species had evidently commenced breeding about
the end of August or the beginning of September.
Much interest was attached to the Black-headed Honey-eater,
because its nest remained so long undiscovered, and the finding
of the nest completed those of the Honey-eaters of Tasmania.
At the meeting of the Royal Society of Tasmania (November,
1884), Mr. E. D. Swan drew attention to the extremely rare nest
and eggs, in fact, the first ever taken, of the Black-cap (Jf.
melanocephalus), which had been found during that month at
Austin’s Ferry, Bridgewater, and presented to the Museum by
Miss A. Brent, Rosemeath.
It is always a pleasure for me to write up an account of the first
find of any nest and eggs new to scientific knowledge. It is more
so in this instance, because the finders were lady field naturalists.
Here is the authenticated story of the discovery by the Misses
Brent of the nest of the Black-capped Honey-eater, as told by
their brother (Mr. A. E. Brent) :
“ The first intimation I received of a nest of our interesting
little Black-capped Honey-eater was from my two youngest sisters.
One day they chanced to witness one of these birds picking wool
from a sheep and flying with it to the top of a small-leafed gum
sapling. From the first they could see that it would be impossible
to reach the spot, therefore they decided to remain watching for
sometime. Then armed with a pair of field-glasses they watched
the progress of the nest from day to day until they made certain
that the bird had commenced sitting. Armed again (but this
time with an axe) my sisters set forth to fell the tree —trusting
to chance, as they said afterwards, that the nest and perhaps the
contents might be saved in the fall.
“ The tree fell midst briars and scrub, and after much scramb-
ling and searching they at last discovered the nest with the poor
little bird clinging fast to it although the nest was almost upside
down. Seeing this they rushed forward, and in so doing scared
the bird away, but owing to the thick mass of leaves, &c.,
crushed under the nest, the eggs were saved from being broken.
Full of excitement the girls related the story to me, and after
this a diligent search was made for more with the result that
several nests wore taken during that season (1884).”


As Mr. C. C. Brittlebank discovered in the case of the
Lunulated or White-naped Honey-eater on the mainland so it has
been independently proved in Tasmania that the Black-capped
Honey-eater will cling to its nest, more especially during windy
weather, if the tree containing it be felled.
Mr. Brent proceeds to state, “ A friend and I discovered one
which was impossible to obtain by climbing at the extreme end of
a horizontal branch of a large White-gum ( Eucalypt ). Our only
way was to fell the tree or sling the branch with a rope. The
latter course was decided upon. A noose was made round the
limb and pushed with a stick as far out as possible, then the rope
was passed over another branch higher up and the other end made
fast at the ground. With a light saw the branch was severed. I
thought to retain my hold at the butt end, but, alas, the bough
proved too much for me, it tipped and swung down, the little bird
remaining fast to the nest which was by this time completely
upside down. We could not venture too near for fear of disturb-
ing her, so I crept in under cover of the foliage and cut the branch
again turning it upright, and in this way we took a full set of
three eggs and an egg of the Pallid Cuckoo.
“ Since discovering this little fact, I have taken many nests
of the Black-capped Honey-eater by felling the trees, but I must
say not always successfully. My experience has taught me to
choose a boisterous day; even a good, steady breeze will suffice,
for nature prompts the sitting bird to cling more closely to her
nest. Care should be taken that the falling tree does not strike
or foul another tree.”
A nest, with eggs, kindly forwarded to me for description, by
Mr. Brent, was taken in like manner, and when the poor bird was
rescued from the fallen foliage, she was covering her own eggs,
beside an additional burden—an egg of the Pallid Cuckoo. Date,
21-11-96.
Mr. Brent has also taken the egg of the Fan-tailed Cuckoo
(C. flahelliformis) from the nest of the little Black-cap, it being
a most unusual occurrence to find that cuckoo’s egg in an open
nest.
In the Appendix of the “ Catalogue ” of the Australian Museum
it is stated that Dr. Holden, of Circular Head, Tasmania, found
several nests of the Black-capped Honey-eater in December (1889).
One in particular was commenced on the 7th of that month, con-
tained three fresh eggs by the 25th. One nest had no wool, but
was chiefly composed of green moss and spider’s web, with a lining
of flower-seeds.
The male Black-capped Honey-eater, and doubtless many other
kinds of birds, sometimes feed the female upon her nest, especially
if the weather be windy.
Breeding months from October to December.

, Observations.— This unique and interesting form of Honey-eater
is strictly a denizen of the interior provinces from Queensland to
bouth Australia where it loves the pine ridges, and open tracts of
Casuarina, Acacia, &c. The bird is the possessor of a loud whistling
note, and is usually found in pairs.
On one occasion only did Gould discover the nest, which was
suspended from the extreme tip of a Casuarina branch overhanging
a stream. ° 6
nr 1 !? i B !° from Mr - R Macfarlane, then at Mai lee
Cliffs Station (N.S.W.), a full set of four eggs of the Striped Honey-
eater. September the following year Mr. A. J. North reports he
received from the Wimmera district, Victoria, a beautiful nest
together with a set of eggs, while it is stated the late Mr. K.
• u nne ? found this Honey-eater breeding plentifully in the
neighbourhood of Ivanhoe and Mossgiel in the interior of New
South Wales.
On the 9th October, 1893, Mr. C. Barnard found in Queensland
a nest of the Striped Honey-eater with the unusually full comple-
ment of five eggs. 1
i Mellor, (South Australia), writes me that he took
about the end of September, 1894, near Lakes Alexandrina and
Albert, a nest of this species containing four eggs. Both parents
were secured for Museum purposes.


I have a note from an interior friend of an attractive nest of
the Striped Honey-eater he saw. It was suspended to the pendu-
lous branches of a Myall ( Acacia ), and decorated with long Emu
feathers loosely stuck on which were flying in the breeze,
t (1818), Gould incidentally states that the circumstances of his having
ad Etrag seen fully-fledged young and eggs at the same time prove that
these birds rear at least two broods in the season.

composed of an elastic ply of Zamia (Cycad) wool; usually placed
close to the ground in the heart of a low bush in open heath-like
country. Average dimensions.over all inches by 2| inches in

large compared with the size of the parent; texture of shell very
fine; surface without gloss ; colour, white, very sparingly and lightly
spotted with chestnut, the markings appearing more particularly
about the apex. Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch—(l)
•88 x -63 (2) -87 x -63.
Observations. —This active Honey-eater has a habitat extending
across the southern portion of Australia, including Tasmania and
some of the islands in Bass Straits. The bird shows a preference
for open, heathy, or low scrubby localities, and is remarkably shy.
Of all the Honey-eaters, I think this bird has the most rapid
flight. It frequently mounts high into the air, hence the trivial
name of “ Sky-lark ” applied to the bird by youths in the neigh-
bourhood of Albany (W.A.).
Besides eating insects, it is commonly known in the King
George’s Sound district that this Honey-eater regales itself on the
nectar of the flaming Bottle-brush [Callistemon) to such an extent
that at certain seasons the bird becomes intoxicated and is easily
32545—8


caught beneath the bushes, helpless. The same sometimes applies to
the Long-billed Honey-eater or “Yellow-wing” as it is locally called.
History repeats itself. Gould recorded regarding this Honey-
eater : “ The site generally chosen for its nest, as observed at the
Swan River, is a low bush or scrubby plant, in which it is often
placed near the ground.” I had frequently observed this bird in
Victoria, and on the adjacent islands in Bass Straits without
finding its nest, but it was just forty-one years after.Gould wrote
his remarks, I was strolling over the limestone ridges of the Lower
Swan, when I flushed a Tawny-crowned Honey-eater and found
my first nest of this wild species in such a position as is exactly
described by Gould (i.e., Gilbert). The nest contained two eggs,
partly incubated. Date, 19th November, 1889.
The month previous, when in the Tor Bay district, near Albany
.shepherd brought me a nest, also with two eggs.
Early in the season of 1896, on the heathy grounds near
Cheltenham, Vic., a pair of Tawny-crowned Honey-eaters was
observed uttering distressing cries over their nest in a bush about
15 inches from the ground. The cause of the disturbance was a
snake, which had extracted one of the young from the nest and
was about to swallow it. The youthful collectors who were
attracted to the spot by the birds’ calls had nothing to battle the
snake with except the handle of a butterfly net. With this they
struck the reptile, which quickly made its escape.
In a communication to me Mr. G. K. Hinsby writes;—“ Re
Glycyphila fulvifrons, I note that Gould mentions it as only
inhabiting the northern parts of Tasmania. I obtained birds and
eggs on the extreme south end of Bruin Island, near Cloudy Bay
Lagoon (Dec., 1884). The nest was cup-shaped, made of She-oak
(Casuarina ) needles, lined with wool and cow’s hair. I never saw
a nest look so strange, not a foot from the ground, in one of the
stunted Bottle-brush shrubs. I saw the male bird perched on a
dead branch of a small gum-tree pouring forth its peculiar note.
As I approached it flew, but I stopped it before it had gone far,
and the shot flushed the female from her nest close by, which I
found without difficulty. The eggs (two) were slightly incubated
and were almost white, with a faint pinkish shade, and spotted
with a few purplish-black spots.”
Breeding months, August to December or January.

Geographical Distribution. —New South Wales, Victoria, South
and West Australia.
Nest. —Very flat structure, the base being composed of very
thin dried stems of a climbing plant and grasses, matted together
with a little wool, over which is placed a layer of wool inter-
mingled with a few blades of grass. Diameter of base, 4 inches ;
the layer of wool 2| inches, and the whole structure inches in
thickness. There is just sufficient depression in the centre to keep
the eggs in position (North).
Eggs.— Clutch, 2; of a light saturnine-red ground-colour; on the
larger end they are thickly spotted, and in a few places blotched
with irregular-shaped markings of reddish-chestnut and chestnut-
brown, but over the remainder of the surface the markings are
much smaller and more sparingly distributed : on the larger end
are obsolete spots of purplish-grey. Dimensions (A), ‘7B x *57
inch ; (B), -82 x -58 (North).
Observations. —Gould first observed this fine species in the great
Murray Scrub of South Australia, where he succeeded in killing
several specimens of both sexes. It is also an inhabitant of the
inland districts of Western Australia, and likewise found in the
interior of Victoria, notably the Wimmera district, and of New
South Wales, where it is a scarce species. I believe it was seen
in the North-west Desert by the Calvert Expedition, 1896.
I have given the detailed description of the nest as given in the
“ Catalogue ” of the Australian Museum, taken by the late Mr.
K. H. Bennett at Ivanhoe, New South Wales, October, 1886.
Gould just mentions in general terms that the nest is “very similar
to that of Meliornis longirostris, but more shallow and less neatly
formed, and that some of the nests observed were constructed in
the fork of a small dead branch in an exposed situation.”

across Northern Australia. In May, 1884, I was indebted to the
late Mr. George Barnard, of Coomooboolaroo (Q.), for. the eggs of
this interesting species. His son, Mr. H. Greensill Barnard,'sub-
sequently wrote me “Re Glycyphila fasciata, the breeding
months are October and November. In November, 1893,1 found
five nests on the Dawson River, three of which were ready for
eggs, one containing a set of three eggs, and the fifth had three
newly-hatched young. The nests are always built on long, droop-
ing twigs overhanging water, and at times are very difficult to
reach. The trees generally selected are Melaleucas, the nests
being built of the bark of that tree.”

Observations. —With regard to the least Honey-eater of the
i;
northern coast, Gould appeared doubtful whether it was really a
good species. First he united it with G. ocularis, then upon further
of
examination separated it again, remarking that the G. subocularis
is a smaller bird than G. ocularis, and consequently one of the
most diminutive (only 4| inches long) of the Meliphagous birds.
on
At Townsville, 1885, this bird first attracted my attention by
n, iu ore its merry, Reed-warbler-like song, which is exceedingly cheerful,
inch, of Gould describes it as “remarkably shrill, rich, clear and distinct in
tone.” He also remarked that when the female is sitting upon
habitat her eggs the male sings all day long, with scarcely any inter-
■lfnd. I mission.
Ega s 0 f I On the Fitzroy River, near Rockhampton, the bird was so
rd sub- I numerous that I had no difficulty in one day (2nd October) in
reedinrf I discovering three of its small nests which were suspended in thick
f 0lln( j I Melaleuca bushes, each containing a pair of eggs. One set, how-
dj f or I ever, was nearly hatched. Subsequently, more inland of Coomoo-
tjjree I boolaroo, I found the merry little Honey-eater quite at home among
j roo I the orange trees standing in the garden, lining its nest with the
ulj. | 0 I soft substance gathered off the bursting vine buds, &c. I should
neg j. g I have remarked that those nests found on the Fitzroy were fur-
nished with the glazed, soft substance of mantis cocoons.
Still more delighted was I a few seasons afterwards to find this
species on the opposite side of the continent, and to hear the
familiar merry songs along the shores of the Swan waters. There
I also found a pair busily building a nest suspended to the dead,
drooping twigs of an Acacia, the nest in this instance being lined
with the woolly substance gathered from numerous Zamia palms
or Cycads.
™), I Before I left the locality (23rd November, 1889) I took a pair
iggs, I of eggs which were of the characteristic light colour of those of
the eastern birds, and resembling those found in the days of yore
[and I by good Gilbert.
In one instance in Western Australia Gilbert found a nest
I attached to the slender fibrous roots hanging beneath a bank over
s y I a pool of water—surely a very unusual situation,

and Aru Islands.
Nest. —Bulky, somewhat long in shape, domed with a hooded
side entrance ; composed or strips, narrow and broad, of the paper-
like Melaleuca bark, matted together; lined inside with softer bark
of the same kind; usually suspended on a Melaleuca, particularly
from a branch overhanging water. Length inches, diameter
?>\ inches ; entrance, which is about the centre of the structure, 1
inch across.
Eggs. —Clutch 2, rarely 3 ; long oval, compressed towards one
end ; texture of shell very fine; surface without gloss; colour,
pure white, with hero and there very minute dark brown, almost
black, specks or dots. Dimensions in parts of an inch : —(1) ‘76
x -51; (2) -75 x -5.
Observations. —The habitat of the Brown-backed or Dusky honey-
eater is Northern Queensland, with an extension on the opposite
coast of New Guinea, dwelling about Melaleuca swamps.
During our Cardwell camp I found a pair of these birds com-
mencing to build (7 September, 1885), their dome-shaped nest in
their favourite tree overhanging a stream.
With regard to the dome-shaped structure of the nest, it is
worthy of remark that while the two southern species—G.fulvi-
frons and G. albifrons —build cup-shaped or open nests, the two
northern kinds— G. fasciata and G. modesta —build covered-in
structures. This would lead us to suppose, from an oological point
of view, there was some specific or sub-specific difference between
the two sets of birds. But, possibly, the northern birds have
been led to conceal their eggs, as well as to suspend the nest over
water where it is difficult to reach, to escape some natural enemy.
Mr, J. A. Boyd sent several sets of eggs of the Dusky Honey-
eater to the Australian Museum from the Herbert River, possibly
that bird’s southern limit.
Further north on the Bloomfield River, Mr. Dudley Le Souef
found several of the dome-shaped nests, suspended generally at a
height of about 8 feet from the ground in Melaleuca saplings.
The following is one of Mr. W. B. Barnard’s notes on the same
species :—“ lam sending you a skin of this little Honey-eater, or
Weaver-bird, which builds a hanging nest composed of Ti-tree
(Melaleuca) bark, with entrance at the side; length about 6 inches;


lays two long eggs, white, with minute black spots. Builds in the
forest country in November and December, usually in little trees
about 10 feet high.”

Nest. —The frailest structure possible, most ingeniously suspended
by the rim to the twigs and thick drooping leaves of the Acacia
pendula, and entirely composed of very tine fibrous roots (Gould).
Eggs. —Unknown.
Observations. —Gould states that this beautiful little Honey-eater
is an inhabitant of the interior of New South M ales, where he
found it frequenting the Myalls ( Acacia ) and other trees bordering
the extensive plains.
It is an interesting fact that this interior bird should have been
taken in the wooded wilds of the Upper Yarra track. Specimens
are in the National Museum, Melbourne, labelled from thatlocality,
Gould observed that this rare little creature is very active among
the branches, capturing insects on the wing and darting forth and
returning to the same spot, much after the manner of Flycatchers.
During flight it repeatedly spreads its tail, when the white portion
of the feathers shows very conspicuously, while the yellow colour-
ing of the wings also contributes to the beauty of its appearance.
Its song is loud and not very harmonious.
The eggs are still a desideratum. The only nest on record was
found by Gould on the sth September, 184-, and contained two
nearly fledged young.

Geographical Distribution. —North-west Australia, Northern
Territory, and North Queensland.
Nest. —Cup-shaped, neat, and somewhat deep; composed of fine
grasses matted outside with spider’s white web ; inside lined with
grasses only ; usually suspended by one side of the rim to a slender
twig of a low (Bauhinia) tree, but occasionally high in a Eucalypt;
dimensions over all, about 2 inches by 3| inches in depth.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2-3 ; inclined to oval; texture, fine; surface
glossy, or slightly so. These eggs vary much, the general type re-
sembling in character those of Maluri or Acanthizce, being warm
white, spotted and blotched, particularly round the apex, with
reddish-brown or chestnut and purplish-brown. Dimensions of
two clutches :—A (1) -71 x -51 ; (2) -7 x -5 ; (3) -68 x -52 ;
B (1) -72 x -49 ; (2) -71 x *5; (3) -67 x -45.
Another type resembles those of Ep)hthianura albifrons, being
white, sparingly spotted with purplish-brown from dark to light
shades. Dimensions:—(l) -73 x -52 ; (2) -72 x •53 ; (3) -72
x -51.
A third type resembles those of Glycyphila modesta, but is
smaller, being white, minutely marked with dark spots.
Observations. —Like the Rufous-breasted (E. albigularis ), the
Red-throated Honey-eater is distributed over Northern Australia.
Dr. Ramsay states it has been found breeding in the neighbourhood
of Georgetown, in the Gulf of Carpentaria country, during the
months from September to March. His examples of nest and eggs
were sent to him by Mr. Armit,and were taken in an Eryihrina tree.
I had the privilege of critically examining several sets of eggs
of the little Red-throated Honey-eater, taken by Mr. G. A.
Heartland in north-western Australia, where the birds appeared
to be numerous, for he informs me he obtained no less than thirty
nests between the 20th February and 16th March, 1897, chiefly
in the Fitzroy River district. Mr. Heartland also tells me that
the nests were usually situated low in a Bauhinia tree, but some-
times were placed high in a Eucalypt. The various types of eggs
above described are in Mr. Heartland’s collection.
Mr. Heartland says, at nesting time, which is immediately after
the tropical rains of January and February, the Red-throated
honey-eaters become very tame. On several occasions he has
stood under a tree within 5 feet of where the birds were building
their nest.

from the extremity of a weak projecting branch overhanging
water (Gilbert).
Eggs. —Clutch, 2-3 ; rather lengthened in form, and not unlike

sions, 9 lines ('75 inch) x 6 lines ('5 inch) —(Gilbert).
Observations. —All the knowledge we possess at present of the
small Rufous-breasted (White-throated of Gould) Honey-eater is
limited to good Gilbert’s researches in Northern Australia. He
says: “ I first met with it on Mayday Island, in Van Dieman’s
Gulf, where it appeared to be tolerably abundant. I afterwards
found it to be equally numerous in a large inland mangrove swamp
near Point Smith. I never observed it anywhere than swampy
situations, or among mangroves bordering deep bays and creeks of
the harbours. Its small pensile nest is suspended from the ex-
tremity of a weak projecting branch in such a manner that it
hangs over the water, the bird always selecting a branch bearing
a sufficient number of leaves to protect the entrance from the
rays of the sun. I found a nest in the latter part of November,
and another in the early part of December, which contained three
eggs each, while a third procured towards the end of January had
only two. During the breeding season it exhibits considerable
pugnacity of disposition, and instead of its usual pretty note,
utters a chattering and vociferous squeaking.”

Nest. —Cup-shaped, somewhat shallow ; composed of pieces of
grass (Spinifex) matted well with spiders’ web; inside lined with
finer grass; usually suspended by the rim in the horizontal forked
branchlet of a low tree. Dimensions, over all, about 4 inches;
egg cavity about 2 inches across (Keartland).
Eggs. —Clutch, 2-3 ; oval in shape, more compressed at one end ;
texture, fine; surface slightly glossy; colour, soft, warm, white or
light yellowish-white, finely but strongly spotted all over with
sepia or dark umber, intermingled with spots and patches of light
or dull grey. Quite exceptional in colour and character to the
general rule for Honey-eaters’ eggs, and resemble more small eggs
of the common Wood-swallow (A. sordidus). Dimensions of a
clutch in parts of an inch (1) -92 x -65 ; (2) -9 x *65 ; (3) *B9 x
•65. A smaller pair (1) -86 x -62 ; (2) -86 x -61.
Observations. —The Pied Honey-eater ranges across Southern
Australia. Gilbert says it is a periodical visitor to the west,
where it arrives in the latter part of October. He has observed
the birds assembling in great flocks, which continue to soar during
the greater portion of the day—a rather remarkable trait for
Honey-eaters.
However, in the North-west Desert, Mr. G. A. Keartland notices
something similar, for he records, “ Towards the end of October
(1896) flocks of these birds frequently passed us going north.”
The knowledge we possess about the rare Pied Honey-eater is
somewhat scant. The nest and eggs collected by the late Mr.
K. H. Bennett, and described by Dr. Ramsay* were no doubt, as
Mr, Keartland has pointed out, referable to the Pied Robin ( P.
bicolor ), and not the Pied Honey-eater.
I had the eggs (two clutches) in my collection since 1890, from
the Gascoigne district, W.A., but as no data accompanied the
specimens I was unable to identify them until Mr. Keartland
recognised them by a nest he found during the progress of the
ill-starred Calvert Expedition through North-western Australia.
The nest was found on the 22nd October, 1896, about 7 feet from
the ground, in a “ cork”-tree, and was among the specimens left
at the abandoned depot in the desert. It is melancholy to reflect
that this particular nest and single egg were found only a day or
two before Mr. Keartland and Mr. G. L. Jones finally parted, the
latter, as will be well remembered, perishing from thirst in the
sand ridges of that terrible region.
However, another pair of eggs taken near the Fitzroy River,
March, 1897, was received by Mr. Keartland.

usually placed on a horizontal limb at the junction of a sprouting
branch, or in a fork in rough-barked Eucalypts in open forest.

Eggs. —Clutch 2 ; nearly oval in shape ; texture fine; surface
slightly glossy ; colour, rich reddish-buff, darker on the apex,
where is a zone of soft or indistinct spots of reddish and purplish-
brown, a few spots also appearing over the rest of the surface.
Dimensions of a clutch in parts in parts of an inch, (1) -96 x -67 ;
(2) -93 x -67.
Observations. —As Gould remarks, the Warty-faced Honey-eater
is not only one of the most handsome of our Honey-eaters, but one
of the most beautiful of Australian birds. On account of the
beauty of its black and golden plumage, it has been called the
“ Mock Regent-bird ”in some localities.
The peculiar plaintive song, accompanied with the bowing of
the head of the Warty-faced Honey-eater is very agreeable. The
bird may be called an interior species, with a habitat ranging from
Queensland down to South Australia, and although Gould regarded
it as a stationary species, it occasionally, according to seasons, or
the supply of the Eucalyptus blossom, wanders towards the coast.
I recollect one season in November—lB6B or 1869—when these
birds were plentiful in the neighbourhood of Oakleigh and Mur-
rumbeena, where we secured as many of their beautifully con-
structed bark-made nests, and lovely rich salmon-coloured eggs, as
we needed. Again, in October, 1882, in the Bendigo district, I
took their nests.
During the great drought in the interior—lß967—the Warty-
faced Honey-eaters were numerous in Victoria, and were noticed
in localities where they had never previously been seen.
Gould somewhat qualifies his statement about the Warty-faced
Honey-eater being a stationary species by stating, “I have occasion-
ally seen flocks of from fifty to a hundred in number passing from


tree to tree as if engaged in a partial migration from one part of
the country to another, or in search of a more abundant supply
of food.”
I myself have witnessed this once at Doncaster, Victoria, 2nd
November, 1886, when a flock of about fifty swept past me across
a valley*.
Mr. Hermann Lau writes : —“ Mock Regent-bird. I first saw
it at Goulburn (N.S.W.) 1855 ; then again at Pike’s Creek,
Queensland, 20 miles south-west of Warren. It only appears in
numbers now and again. The site of its big nest is, at about the
height of 20 feet in a tree, and always near a thick stem or a
few sprouting shoots. It is roughly made of coarse dry grass,
lined with rootlets and animal hair. Deposits two or three eggs.

simplicity I prefer to retain Gould’s name, P. notata , which
appears under a fine picture of the bird in his folio supplement.
The Yellow-spotted Honey-eater maybe said to be the northern
and smaller representative of the Yellow-eared (P. lewini). Gould
says Gilbert collected a bird very nearly allied, if not the Yellow-

] 844, when travelling with Leichhardt from Moreton Bay to Port
Essington.
During the Scientific Expedition to Bellenden-Ker Bange (1889),
the Yellow-spotted Honey-eater was found at all heights up to
4,000. feet.
Mr. A. J. North, who has accurately described the nest and
eggs of this bird, states : —“ Mr. Boyd (Herbert River) has also
from time to time supplied me with the following information.
A nest of this species he had under close observation from the
time it was started until the young left the nest. It was a most
curious position selected, the nest being built upon the frond of a
fern 18 inches from the ground, growing in a fernery attached to
Mr, Boyd’s house, and opposite his office, to which people were
constantly coming through the day j a piano also, that was in
frequent use by the children, being within 15 feet of the nest.
During the period of incubation the female sat steadily, and did
not attempt to fly when looked at by one only 3 feet away, the
nest being so deep that the whole of the bird’s body was invisible
except the bill. The bird was quite tame, and used to fly back-
wards and forwards through the dining-room when a number of
persons were seated at dinner. The nest was commenced on the
7th December, and contained three eggs on the 15th ; two young
ones were hatched on the 28th, and a third next day—the period
of incubation being fourteen days. The young birds left the nest
on the 12th January.”

a few purplish spots. The eggs, being amongst the most richly-
coloured of Australian Honey-eaters’, are exceedingly beautiful.

Observations. —As already mentioned, there have been more
synonyms and confusion than enough, so much have doctors
differed about the identification of the Yellow-spotted Honey-
eaters of Northern Australia and contiguous localities.
Finally, Dr. Sharpe has classified them into three races according
to geographical distribution. Whether there be races, varieties,
or species, from an oological point of view (which is a somewhat
sound one, for “by their fruits ye shall know them”), there are
certainly two distinct Yellow-spotted Honey-eaters other than P.
lewini inhabiting Northern Queensland, and which it appears
Gould has clearly pointed out—first, the larger bird, P. notata,
and second, the smaller species, P. gracilis. The birds are pre-
cisely similar in appearance save in size ; yet while the eggs of
the former resemble those of its southern cousin, P. leivini, being
white, with a few dark spots, the others, besides being proportion-
ately smaller, are a fleshy tint and richly coloured. The decided
difference in the two classes would appear constant, judging by
the series of eggs, identified by skins of both kinds of birds shot
from the nests, which I had the opportunity of examining with
Mr. Dudley Le Souef, at the Zoological Gardens, Melbourne.
When collecting at Cape York, 1896-7 season, Mr. Harry
Barnard took nine or ten nests, each containing two eggs of P.
notata, and four nests—three each two eggs, the other a single
of P. gracilis. There are also birds and eggs of both kinds in the
collection of Mr. Le Souef, which he brought down from the
Bloomfield Elver district.
I hardly know that I am correct in giving as a reference Dr.
Earn say’s description of the eggs taken near Cairns by Mr. Boyer-
Bower as belonging to those of the smaller species. The rich
colouration—“nearest to those of P. auricomis ” —agrees, but not
the dimensions.

from Northern Queensland down to probably South Australia,
Although this Honey-eater is not distinguished by any brilliancy
of colour, Gould has painted it in a pretty word picture. Referring
to the bird in the brushes of New South Wales, he says, “ In the
months of August and September, when the beautiful Tecoma is
in blossom, the Honey-eater may be seen flitting about among the
thick clusters of the pendant flowers in search of insects, which
are sometimes captured on the wing, but more generally extracted
from the tubular florets.”
In the Bendigo district, Victoria, towards the Campaspie River,
I once came upon quite a number of Fuscous Honey-eaters feeding
upon Grevillea bushes that grew in a snug hollow in an Ironbark
(Eucalypt) forest. I did not see a nest, however, until I went to
Coomooboolaroo, Queensland, where I observed one suspended
among the flowering branchlets of a Eucalytus near the lagoon.
The Messrs. Barnard informed me that like many other birds,
the Fuscous Honey-eater lays according to the season; if droughty
one or two eggs are laid, if the season be good three are deposited.
Once a clutch of four was taken which is, of course, an exceptional
complement.
Breeding months, August to December, or later.

Nest. —Cup-shaped, deep, with substantial walls ; constructed ,
chiefly of strips of bark (Melaleuca, &c.), and spiders’ cocoons,
generally outwardly beautifully covered with moss; lined inside
with thick warm ply of a downy or silky substance, such as
thistle-down or other soft seeds, varying in colour—white, brown,
or yellowish—according to the locality or the species of plant
from which the seeds are gathered; usually attached to the twigs
of a thick bush or tree in scrub and forest country alike. Dimen- !

brown, almost black, most of the markings being on the apex or
about the upper quarter. Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an
inch : (1) -96 x -7; (2) -96 x -7.
Observations. —This fine Honey-eater is common to the forests
and scrubs of Eastern Australia, chiefly in the coastal region. It
is doubtful whether they are found at Cape York. I am not
certain whether they frequent the Cape Otway forest, but I have I
observed the bird as far south as the Dandenongs, near Melbourne,
where I have often heard, as Gould describes it, the loud, ringing,
whistling song of the bird. In Gippsland in the autumn I have p
observed Lewin’s or the Yellow-eared Honey-eater feeding in the j it
forest clearings on the fruit of the so-called Kangaroo-apple bush si
( Solarium).
The first nest I found of this species was in October, 1885. It j 2
was about 10 or 12 feet from the ground in scrub, near the Fitzroy
Paver (Q.). The eggs, however, were addled, but there was no si
mistaking the identity of them and the nest, with its beautiful ol
lining of white silky substance. as
The next nest that came under my observation -was in the “ Big i d
Scrub, Richmond River (K.S.W\), where the birds are exceed- J a
numerous, and where I often admired their graceful actions d
while pirouetting in mid-air after insects. The nest, which con- d
tained two eggs, was brought to me by scrub-fallers, who reported g
that it originally contained three eggs (the number being usually | (1
a pair), and was taken in a thick bush, about 4 feet from the
ground. The nest was constructed of moss and dead leaves, and t(
was lined with grass and a thick warm ply of thistle-down. Date, Ii

water in a gully under the Liverpool Range.
According to the Australian Museum “ Descriptive Catalogue,” 1 ii
Dr. Ramsay, on the 29th December, 1871, took two eggs on the : d


Mary River (Q.), which were probably the specimens referred to in
the P.Z.S. (1875), but for which no dimensions were furnished.
A nest of the Yellow-eared Honey-eater, taken near Melbourne
in a Musk-tree in the Dandenongs, is large and composed of beauti-
ful green moss interlaced with strips of brownish-coloured bark
and lined inside with a thick ply of the whitish cotton-like sub-
stance evidently gathered from the underside of the leaves of the
Blanket-wood ( Senecio ). Dimensions—outward, 4-5 inches across
by 4 inches deep; inside, 23 inches across by 2 inches deep.
Hear the same locality, after a picnic party had departed, I, and
some other persons, were entertained by one of the fine Honey-
eaters, which descended close by and ate, with a relish, some
particles of preserved fruit that were left.
Breeding months, September to December or January.

inside neatly lined with a white, wiry, vegetable fibre, forming a
strong contrast to the reddish-brown colour of the exterior.
Dimensions over all, 4 "2 5 inches by 2'6 inches in depth ; egg cavity,
2'5 inches across by D 6 inches deep (North).
Eggs. —Clutch, 2 ; oval in form, tapering gradually to the
smaller end, and are white with minute dots and round markings
of purplish-black and brownish-grey, the latter colour appearing
as if beneath the surface of the shell; as usual the markings pre-
dominate on the thicker end, where in places they become confluent
and form an irregular zone ; with the exception of these zones
the markings on one of the specimens are larger and more sparingly
dispersed, in the other they are uniformly distributed over the
greater portion of the surface of the shell. Dimensions in inches—
(l) -93 x -65 ; (2) -95 x -65 (North).
Observations.— This very fine northern Honey-eater is only known
to exist in the Rockingham Bay district, chiefly in the ranges.
It is found as far north as the Bloomfield River. Mr. Kendal
Broadbent, when collecting for Dr. Ramsay, first found the species
in the Cardwell district, where a few individuals were obtained
frequenting blossoming Eucalypts near the margin of a swamp.
I think it was this species we found in Dalrymple’s Gap feasting
in numbers upon the heads of long, erect, flowering spikes of a
dark-red colour of the graceful Umbrella-tree ( Brassaia ).

Through the “Records” of the Australian Museum we learn
that the "first recorded nest of the Bridled Honey-eater was found
by Mr. W. S. Day at Cairns, on the 28th November, 1891. It
was placed in a mass of creepers growing over a small shrub at
a height of about 3 feet from the ground. The nest was built of
stronger materials than is usual for the species, and unattached at
the rim. The eggs (two), which were partially incubated, were
also unlike those typical of Ptilotes, approaching nearer in colour
and the disposition of their markings those of some members of
the Wood Swallows ( Artami ). The parents were also procured.

Nest. —Cup-shaped, deep; in Western Australia substantially
interwoven and constructed of strong green-gathered grass, lined
inside with wool, cow-hair, long horse-hairs, &c.; usually suspended
in a bush or tree in open forest country. Dimensions, 3f inches
over all by 3 inches in depth; egg cavity 2 inches across by
If inch deep.
In eastern parts the nest is somewhat thinner ; the grass being
matted with spider’s web, while the lining is fibrous rootlets.
Dimensions, over all, 2f inches by If inch in depth; egg cavity,
2 inches across by 1 inch deep.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2-3 ; oval in shape, more or less compressed
towards one end; texture of shell, fine; colour, a delicate pinkish
buff, or beautiful fleshy tint having the appearance of a darker shade
in the form of a cap on the apex, this dark patch being really


formed by a coalescence of numerous indistinct specks. At first
sight the eggs closely resemble those of the Pallid Cuckoo ( C .
pallidus). Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch (1) *Bl x -6;
(2) -81 x -6; (3) -8 x -59.
Observations. —T do not think any Honey-eater enjoys such a
widespread range as the Singing Honey-eater, which has been
observed in almost every part of the continent, the heavier-forested
parts excepted. I have had the pleasure of finding their nests
and delicately coloured flesh-tinted eggs, both in the east and in
the west of Australia, therefore I am able to attest to the difference
of structure (the nests of the western birds being the heavier built)
as pointed out by Gould.
The first nest I took (October, 1885) was in the Mallee country
near IS!hill, Victoria, when I observed the birds building in a
“ Bull-oak ” {Gasuarina), and subsequently obtained a pair of
beautiful eggs from it. My last find was a well-built nest placed
a few feet from the ground in a short growth of ti-tree (Melaleuca)
scrub, Quindalup (W.A.). This nest, from which I flushed the
bird, contained a lovely set of 3 eggs. The Singing Honey-eater is
one of the most common birds I met with in Western Australia.
It is found breeding in orchards, where I noticed old nests in
orange and lemon trees. In one garden I watched a fine bird
clinging to a large head of bluish flowers ( Echiurri ) busily probing
each flower for honey with the same rapidity as a domestic fowl
would pick up grain.
Why is the bird called the “Singing” Honey-eater 1 Gould says
its song is “full, clear, and loud.” All 1 could ever hear, save a
few shattering notes, was “ Cr-rook, cr-rook,” uttered while the
bird, with graceful flight, passed from tree to tree.
Mr. Hermann Lau, in his MS. notes from Darling Downs (Q.),
says : —“ Ptilotis vittata (sonora), locally called the Large-striped
Honey-eater, gets its name from the yellow line over the eyes.
This bird loves hanging its cradle on the lower branches of a
Casicarina, near water, on the outskirts of a thicket. The cradle,
or rather hammock, is made of grass with rootlets for a floor; has
sometimes three eggs. Cunningham’s Gap, October, 1876.”
Writing to me from Yorke Peninsula (S.A.), Mr. James G.
McDougall includes a curious note :—“ The Singing Honey-eater
builds a small and airy nest of wool, hair, and fine grass inter-
laced with twigs of Ti-tree and She-oakwithout lining; eggs, two,
but sometimes three. In October, 1886, I found a nest of this
bird tenanted by two hens and containing five eggs, three of which
were the usual colour and two pure white.”
In the Australian Museum “ Catalogue,” Mr. A. J. North gives
field notes of the late Mr. K. H. Bennett, respecting the nest of
the Singing Honey-eater, and describes eggs collected by Mr.
James Ramsay (1880) and by the late Mr. W. Liscombe (1883).


Breeding season includes the months from the end of July or
the beginning of August to December. Several clutches of these
eggs were taken in West Australia by the Calvert Expedition
during August, 1896. Occasionally they were the only kinds
observed on the sandhills.

Eest. —Elegant, cup-shaped, deep with swollen sides; somewhat
frailly constructed of fine curly pieces of beautiful moss inter-
mingled with spiders’ web, sometimes with fine shreds of bark
added ; inside lined with very fine light-coloured rootlets and
pieces of grass ; usually situated in a low bush, particularly a
Melaleuca or Leptospermum overhanging a stream, or sometimes
sewn, as it were, by the rim with cobweb to a fern (bracken)
frond. Dimensions over all 3 inches by 2|- inches in depth; egg
cavity 2 inches across by 2 inches deep.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2-3 ; lengthened in form ; texture fine ; surface
slightly glossy ; colour, light reddish or pinkish-buff, marked and
freckled all over, and in a confluent patch round the apex, with
rich reddish-chestnut and purplish-grey; the eggs are singular for
this genus, and somewhat resemble those of the Minah ( Myzantha
garrula) in miniature. However, some examples are whiter in
the ground colour, with round spots about the apex. Dimensions
of a clutch in parts of an inch : (1) *B2 x - 57 ; (2) -74 x -54.
Observations. —This cheerful Yellow-faced Honey-eater, as Gould
states, may be regarded as a common species, and inhabits all the


eastern colonies, more particularly the coastal regions. It is very
destructive to fruit, and is especially fond of grapes. Mr. North
writes it is one of the most common species of the genus Ptilotis
inhabiting the parks and gardens of Sydney. It is probably
nowhere more numerous than in Victoria, where it may be heard
(often at early morn) by its happy, chirrup-like song, near forest
streams, or in scrub by river’s margin.
The moss-bedecked nest and the typical red mottled eggs of
the Yellow-faced Honey-eater are exceedingly beautiful. Many I
have found, notably at Lilydale and Upper Werribee. At the
latter locality I specially remember a very pretty one situated in
a charming spot. It was suspended in an Acacia bush in blossom
that hung over a moss-covered bank of a dry watercourse in a
silent and sheltered nook of an Ironbark forest. (Date 11-10-90.)
The first nest of this species I took was at Malvern, 1869. The
eggs were the exceptional type, more distinctly spotted, like those
of its White-plumed cousin (P. penicillata). The only other
eggs I found of this type were obtained at Berwick, January,
1880.
Gould found a nest near the Liverpool Ranges, which was so
thinly constructed that he could see through it. Such examples
I have noticed myself, when the eggs could be seen from beneath.
Mr. Hermann Lau’s observations of the Yellow-faced Honey-
eater in southern Queensland are that it is usually found in the
sea-coast scrubs, and places its nest in a small bush, 4 or 6 feet
high. The nest consists of dry grass outside, and feathers and
rootlets for lining ; lays two eggs.—Cunningham’s Gap, October,
1876.
The little Yellow-faced Honey-eater is not only lively and cheer-
ful, but is persevering, as the following observations of Mr, and
Mrs. De Laney attest. On the Wombat Creek, near Omeo, Vic-
toria, a pair built in a shapely Blackwood (Acacia) in the garden.
As the site was rather near the fruit trees, the nest and eggs were
taken, but next day in the same tree a new nest was found nearly
completed, both birds working at it, and before the week was out
had eggs. Again the nest was robbed, and so on for six times,
each clutch being the full complement of three eggs. However,
the seventh time (there is luck in odd numbers, as the saying
goes) the birds won by building a nest near the ground in a low
bush about ten paces distant from the Blackwood tree, which was
not discovered till it contained young.
Breeding months, July to February. Mr. C. C. Brittlebank
and I observed birds building a nest on the bank of the Lerder-
derg River, 6 Feb. (1892). Mr. C. F. Belcher, in his pleasantly
written article in the “Wombat,” “Notes on birds of the Geelong
District,” mentions a pair of eggs he took at Lake Connewarre as
late as the 12 Feb. (1890).

Observations. —Gould reckoned that the Streak-naped Honey-
eater was more nearly allied to the White-gaped Hbneyeater (P.
unicolor) than to any other, but is strikingly different from all
its congeners by the thread-like streak beneath the ear coverts,
and by the small strim which decorate the back of the neck, hence
the very appropriate vernacular name, Streak-naped Honey-eater.
The original specimens described by Gould were among the
novelties which rewarded the researches of Mr. James Wilcox,
who obtained two examples among the mangroves at Cape York.

Geographical Distribution. —Tasmania, and some of the larger
islands in Bass Straits, notably King and Blinders.
Nest. —Cup-shaped, deep ; outwardly constructed of bark
( Melaleuca ), fine twigs, grass, and spiders’ cocoons; inside warmly
lined with fur, hair, wool, &c. ; usually placed low in a thick bush
or in scrub. The nest is not unlike that of P. leucotis of the
mainland. Dimensions over all 4 inches by 3| deep ; egg cavity,
inches across by 2 deep.
Eggs. —Clutch 2-3 (3-4, Brent) ; oval in shape, compressed
towards one end; texture of shell fine ; surface slightly glossy ;
colour, warm or pinkish-white, sparingly spotted with reddish-
brown or chestnut and purplish-grey. Dimensions of odd examples
in parts of an inch (1) -93 x '7; (2) ’9l x - 67.
Observations. —The exceedingly fine Yellow-throated Honey-
eater is well named for its beautiful colouring upon the throat.
It is an insular form confined to Tasmania and some of the islands
in Bass Straits, notably King Island and Blinders Group. In the
last-named localities we procured birds and nests during the expe-
ditions (1887 and 1893) of the Bield Naturalists’ Club of Victoria.
On King Island two nests were found in low bushes, and were
warmly furnished with a thick ply of opossum’s fur. Our speci-
mens of birds were easily procured. All that was necessary was


to imitate their whistle-like “ tchook, tchook ” call notes, when a
poor bird would often answer and fly into the tree overhead its
deceiver, from whence it easily fell to a half charge of dust shot.
Strolling through the scrub on Flinders, I watched a pair of
Yellow-throats chevying each other through the trees. A butterfly
crosses in front, diverting the attention of the foremost bird, which
instantly captures it and flies to a tree. Devouring the insect, the
bird wipes its bill on the branch, with evident satisfaction, and
makes off again.
An unoccupied nest I found in a Ti-tree thicket is not unlike
that of the White-eared Honey-eater of the mainland, being con-
structed of bark, grass, and spiders’ cocoons, but lined with wool
and feathers instead of hair only. However, in Tasmania the
Yellow-throated Honey-eater has been seen gathering hair for its
nest from live animals—even “human” animals—for Mr, A. E.
Brent gives me the following amusing story :
He and a companion were in hiding among ferns (bracken) in
a deep gully watching for hawks. A Yellow-throated Honey-eater
was noticed poking about as if it had a nest near. They took off
their hats so as not to attract the bird’s attention. The bird
hopped around, then alighted upon one of their heads, and com-
menced tugging at the hair, which would not yield like the fur
of a marsupial. The bird tugged harder, but the hair slipping
through its bill caused the bird to turn a semi-somersault back-
wards, which made Mr. Brent and his companion laugh so that
the bird was scared away. The nest in process of building was
found about 15 paces away.
Gould found a nest containing young (28th September, 1839).
He also described the nest, its situation, and eggs.
Breeding months, August to December.

Observations. —These finely-shaped Honey-eaters, which, as Gould
points out, differ from the other members of the genus in the dis-
tinct bars of pale yellow and brown which mark the throat and
fore part of the neck, are generally found in belts of mangroves on
the Queensland coast, and adjacent low, swampy islands, and are
sometimes called thelsland Honey-eater. During an excursion with
Mr. A. W. Milligan, on the Lower Fitzroy, we found the birds
making the mangroves merry with their pleasant notes. The birds
were extremely shy, nevertheless we succeeded in procuring a
couple of skins.

Nest. —Cup-shaped, deep; well constructed of fine bark and grass,

bush or in low scrub. Dimensions over all to 4 inches, by
2£ to 3|- inches in depth; egg cavity 2 inches across by 14- inch
deep.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2 usually; oval, compressed towards one end ;
texture fine, surface slightly glossy; colour, almost white, but
sometimes of a delicate flesh tint, sparingly but distinctly marked
and spotted with pinkish-red, the spots being more about the upper
quarter. Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch: (1) -86 x
•64 ; (2) -85 x -63.
Observations. —This fine, showy Honey-eater, with conspicuous
white ears, is not an uncommon bird in lightly timbered and
heathy tracts of country in Victoria and other southern parts. It
is a scarce bird in Western Australia. I fancy Dr. Ramsay’s
north-west habitat for this species needs verification.
The bird is an early breeder. I had always to be afield in the
coastal scrubs about the beginning of September if I wanted fresh
eggs. The nest is difficult to find amongst the acres of thick, short
scrub, and frequently is only detected by watching the movements
of the bird, which at all times is exceedingly wily. My greatest find
of White-eared Honey-eaters’ nests in one season was in 1883, if I
recollect rightly—the year when I found three nests all situated
about a foot from the ground, and lined with a thick warm ply of
cow-hairs wonderfully woven.
It is interesting to watch the birds plucking hair off while
perched on the backs of cattle, and rather a difficult task it proves
for the bird to effect lodgment, especially if the cow patronised
be not in an amiable mood, when she tosses her head angrily and
switches her tail from flank to neck, while the bird, fluttering over,
waits an opportunity to dodge the cow’s tail, and between each
lash plucks a few hairs till a mouthful is obtained, then flies to
its nest.
Mr. G. E. Shepherd, Somerville, Victoria, lias enjoyed a some-
what comical experience with nest-building White-eared Honey-
eaters. They have actually plucked hairs from his horse when he
was riding through the country.


No doubt before cattle were introduced to' Australia this beau-
tiful Honey-eater furnished its nest with the hair or fur of kan-
garoos and other indigenous animals.
Mr. C. F. Belcher has observed that the same pair of White-
eared Honey-eaters will build within a few feet of the same spot
year after year.

Observations. —Of this rare honey-eater Gould writes : —“ It is
but an act of justice that at least one of the birds of Australia
should be named after Mr. James Cockerell, inasmuch as he is a
native-born Australian, has collected very largely in the northern
parts of that great country, and discovered more than one new
species, amongst which must be enumerated the present very
interesting bird.”
Mr. Cockerell found his namesake frequenting the little-explored
parts of Cape York Peninsula, often in company with the Blue-
bellied Lorikeet and the Yellow-spotted Honey-eater.
When Mr. Harry Barnard was collecting for Mr. D. Le Souef
and others during the breeding season of 1896-7, at Cape York,
he met with the Cockerell Honey-eater, but did not succeed in
procuring its nest.

Observations. —This exceedingly handsome and attractive Honey-
eater favours the more inland portions of South Queensland, New
South Wales, and Victoria, and especially loves Ironbark (Eucalypt)
forests.
Some species of Honey-eaters are gregarious at times. Towards
the end of our summer (March, 1889) I witnessed the unusual sight
of about 100 or more of the beautiful Yellow-tufted Honey-eaters
flying in a flock northward across the rich flats of Bacchus Marsh.
I have observed Yellow-tufted Honey-eaters nesting in the Iron-
bark saplings near Bendigo, also on the Upper Werribee, but was
always unfortunate in the matter of securing eggs. A nest from
the latter locality, found in a Golden Wattle (Acacia) sapling, was
somewhat large, deep, and firmly built of fine strips of reddish
strings of bark, together with spiders’ cocoons, and was lined inside
with finer shreds of the same coloured bark, thistle-down, and such-
like soft seeds.
The eggs in my collection ai’e from Dr. Ramsay, who has enjoyed
early and delightful nesting experiences with this beautiful Honey-
eater, and whose remarks I make no apology for quoting at length;
“ This species remains with us in the neighbourhood of Sydney
throughout the whole year, breeding earlier than the generality of
Honey-eaters. We have eggs in our collection taken early in June,
and as late as the end of October, during which month they some-
times have a third brood. August and September seem to be
their principal months for breeding. Upon referring to my note-
book, I find that I captured two young birds well able to fly, on
the 18th of July, 1863 ; but during some seasons birds breed here
much earlier than in others. The nest is a neat but somewhat
bulky structure, open above, and composed of strips of the Stringy-
bark tree (Eucalyptus obliqua). The total length of the nest is
about four inches by from two inches and a-half to three inches
wide, being two inches deep by one inch and a-half inside. The
e gg s > which are usually two in number, are of a pale flesh-pink,
darker at the larger end, where they are spotted and blotched with
markings of a much deeper hue, inclining to salmon-colour; in
some the markings form a ring upon the thick end, in others, one
inegular patch with a few dots upon the rest of the surface.
When freshly taken, they have a beautiful blush of pink, which
they generally lose a few days after being blown. Their length is
from ten to eleven lines by seven to eight in breadth. Some
varieties have a few obsolete dots of faint lilac ; others are with-
out markings, save one patch at the top of the larger end. Like
most of our Australian birds’ eggs, they vary much in shape and


tint of colour. The site selected for the nest is usually some low
bushy shrub, among the rich clusters of Tecoma australis , or care-
fully hidden in the thick tufts of Blechnum (B. cartilagineum),
which often cover a space of many square yards. In these clumps,
where it clings to the stems of ferns, I have several times found
two or three pairs breeding at the same time within a few yards
of each other. The ferns and Tecomce seem to be their favourite
places for breeding, although the nests may often be found placed
suspended between forks in the small bushy oaks ( Casuarince ). In
the nest of this Honey-eater, I have several times found the egg of
the Cuculus inornatus (pallidus).”
The following is an interesting note kindly sent to me by Mr.
C. C, Brittlebank : —“ Yellow-tufted Honey-eaters’ nests have been
observed in the trees and shrubs as under : 1 Old-man ’ Saltbush,
about three feet from the ground (9th November—young); Wattle-
tree, about seven feet from the ground; Ironbark (Eucalypt), at
about forty feet; Aster, with a leaf like Rosemary (18 October—
eggs); Gray-box (Eucalypt), about fifty feet high (26 October—
old birds feeding young). Nests in all cases were built of moss,
root-fibres, grass, and spiders’ cocoons. In one instance the birds
were working at their nests while I was within 6 feet of them.
The nests as built here greatly resembles that of the Yellow-faced
Honey-eater ( P. chrysops ), but are thicker towards the bottom.
One nest had several pieces of bark woven through the structure
and over the branches to which it hung. Have only seen these
nests in one part of this district (the Upper Werribee River), and
only in a tract of country about half a square mile in extent.”

Nest. —Substantial, cup-shaped, deep, with bulging sides; con-
structed of soft strings or strips of brownish bark (E. ohliqua),
with a few spider’s cocoons and a leaf or two inserted ; inside lined
with fine bark and other soft material such as hair, Clematis seeds,
die. ; usually suspended in the branch of a low tree or bush near
or overhanging a stream, in thick forest. Dimensions over all,
3-|- to 4 inches by 4 inches in depth; egg cavity, 2£ inches across
by 21 inches deep.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2; well-shaped, oval, slightly compressed towards
one end ; texture, fine; surface, slightly glossy; colour of a fleshy


tint, moderately marked with reddish or pinkish-brown, and dull
purplish spots, more numerous about the apex. Dimensions of
two clutches in parts of an inch. A—(1) '95 x -69 ; (2) *94 x -68 ;
B—(1) -92 x -63; (2) -91 x -64.
Observations. —The Helmeted or Leadbeater’s Honey-eater is
perhaps the rarest and the most splendid bird of its genus. It
was brought to scientific light in a peculiar way. Gould’s friend,
Sir William Jardine, sent him a specimen obtained in Edinburgh
from among a collection of ordinary Australian species. The new
bird was exhibited at a meeting of the London Zoological Society,
December, 1866.
The Helmeted Honey-eater has a somewhat local habitat, con-
fined to the great forests of Gippsland, where no doubt it takes
the place of its more inland congener, the beautiful Tufted Honey-
eater ( P. auricomis), which it resembles. Like the Tufted, the
Helmeted is gregarious at seasons; Mr. A. W. Milligan informed
me he had seen a large flock in the vicinity of Olinda Greek, near
Lilydale.
It was at that creek that the only three authenticated nests
have been discovered. The first and historical nest being found
during the first camp-out of the Field Naturalists’ Club of Vic-
toria, November, 1884. I was aware these fine birds existed in a
certain patch of Native Hazel ( Pomaderris) scrub, where on
several occasion I made attempts, but failed to discover their
breeding-places. The camp-out having formed themselves into
parties, I piloted the oologists to the hazel patch, which was hardly
entered before the honor fell to the late Mr. W. Hatton of detect-
ing the first nest with the rare Honey-eater sitting. The nest was
situated at a height of about 20 feet, and was suspended to an
out-stretched branch of a Hazel overhanging the creek. With what
ecstacy of delight the small tree was ascended! The handsome
bird still retained possession of its nest. With Mr. Hatton’s
assistance, I all but had my hands on the coveted prize, when,
without a moment’s warning, crash went the tree by the root, and
all—the two naturalists, tree, bird, nest, and eggs—went headlong
into the stream beneath. Alas ! I thought, farewell to the eggs
of Ptilotis cassidix. So near and yet so far ! But imagine our
astonishment when, after dragging ourselves out of the water, and
removing some of the fallen debris, to find nest and eggs intact
—thanks to the poor bird, which bravely stuck to its home till
overwhelmed by the falling foliage. The eggs, in which incuba-
tion had just commenced, were beautiful specimens, and are now
in my cabinet.
The second nest was discovered by two field naturalists the
following season, near the same locality, also in a Hazel, overhang-
ing the stream, while the third nest I found 9th October, 1886, in
the same creek, but nearer Lilydale. By bending the bush or


small tree, this nest was reached from the ground. The eggs—
a pair—were perfectly fresh, and now adorn the collection at the
National Museum, Melbourne.
Breeding months are most likely from September to December

Nest. —Most resembles that of P. sonora (Singing Honey-eater),
being somewhat thinly constructed of grass matted with spider’s
web, &c., and suspended in a bush or low tree.
Eggs. —Unknown.
Observations. —The Wattled-cheeked Honey-eater has been
chiefly found along the southern part of Australia, where it seems
to love the timber of the drier country.
Gould first found it as a new species on the 26th June, 1839,
in the ranges near the Upper Torrens, in South Australia.
When hunting for Mallee-hen mounds in the Wimmera District,
Victoria, I met with this Honey-eater in the scrub, and observed
a bird building low (within reach) in a Mallee tree. The birds,
which were fairly numerous, were noisy, but shy.
This honey-eater may be distinguished from all of its kind by
the stripes of beautiful, lilac-coloured, naked skin which stretches
from the corner of the mouth, and extends down the sides of the
cheeks; hence the vernacular name—“ Wattle-cheeked.”

•88 x-6 ; (2) -85 x -58; an odd example, 'B9 x -68.


Observations. —In a small parcel of skins collected by Mr. Tom.
Carter in the vicinity of the North-west Cape about 1890, I
received one skin of this Honey-eater. I did not pay much atten-
tion to it at the time beyond taking it to be a variety of the Singing
Honey-eater.
Mr. G. A. Heartland found the same kind of bird in Central
Australia during the Horn Scientific Exploring Expedition, 1895,
and Mr. A. J. North, who was entrusted to examine all the skins
collected by the expedition, recognised a specific difference in the
Honey-eater and dedicated it to Mr. Heartland, a compliment
richly deserved for his enthusiasm as a field ornithologist.
In 1896 Mr. Heartland again met his namesake in some
scattered Mallee near the tropical line in Western Australia
during the unfortunate expedition promoted by Mr. Calvert.

Geographical Distribution. —South Queensland, New South
Wales, Victoria, South (includes the interior) and West Australia.
Nest. —Cup-shaped, small, sides slightly swollen ; constructed of
grass matted with spider’s web and cottony substances, sometimes
with greenish-coloured cocoons ; inside lined with cottony material
and long horsehair ; usually situated well out of reach, suspended
to the pendulous branch of a Eucalypt, not unfrequently near or
overhanging water, but occasionally placed low in a Melaleuca,
Acacia, &o. Dimensions over all 2-2J inches by 2-21 inches in
depth ; egg cavity inches across by 1J inches deep.
Eggs. —Clutch 2-3; long oval, compressed towards one end;
texture fine ; surface very slightly glossy ; colour, delicate pinkish-
white, moderately marked with distinct roundish spots of pinkisli-
brown and purplish-grey. Sometimes, especially more inland, the
ground colour is pure white and the markings few and faint.
Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch : (1) 'B6 x ’59 ; (2)
•84 x -58; (3) -83 x -58.
Observations. —The principal habitat of this familiar Honey-
eater may, roughly speaking, be said to be the south. However,
it has been observed in Central Australia and a portion of the
west, notably between Lake Way and Lake Augusta, where Mr.
G. A, Heartland states he observed the birds numerous wherever
water was found. Several nests containing young were noticed


as early as 3rd July (1896), while at the camel depot on an
unnamed creek several clutches of eggs were secured during the
following month.
The bird is common in Victoria, where it appears to be one of
the few native birds that thrive, or, at all events, is not driven
back by the advance of civilisation ; in fact, its numbers have
rather increased in the parks and gardens in the vicinity of Mel-
bourne. In our school-boy days we called the bird the “Greenie,”
on account of its olive-green plumage.
The White-plumed Honey-eater, like all the members of its genus,
is an active little creature, and a trifle pugnacious. Single-handed,
it easily knocks a sparrow on its back. Should a large bird or
natural enemy appear this Honey-eater sets up a shrill, rapid,
monotonous “ pee-pee-pee ” alarm, which is immediately taken up
by all the species in the neighbourhood. The Honey-eaters then
congregate about where the intruder is perched, screech and scold
it till it is fairly scared, and glad to depart.
Gould describes the nest of this species, but not the eggs, except
that they were three in number. He quoted from a South Aus-
tralian correspondent, who wrote : —“ The Ftilotis penicillata
builds in the Acacias close to my house at Collingrove, near
Angaston. I can sit at dinner and watch the young ones being
fed. One female sat hatching close to the window, with the strong
light of a moderator lamp shining on her at night.”
A nest of the White-plumed Honey-eater containing a set of
beautiful fleshy-white eggs, with pronounced spots of pinkish
brown, are indeed, although common, amongst the most beautiful
things of a collector’s cabinet.
On the Murray I have found the eggs of the White-plumed
Honey-eater almost white, and with very few markings. Still
further afield, in Central Australia, Mr. G. A. Heartland, in the
Report of the Horn Scientific Expedition, states he also took eggs
of this species which were white, with faint spots.
Only on one occasion have I found the large flesh-coloured egg
of the Pallid Cuckoo ( C . pallidus ) in a nest of the White-plumed
Honey-eater.
The principal breeding months are September to December.
However, the extreme limits of the season may be taken from
June or July to February.

Geographical Distribution. —Victoria, (probably the south-west
interior of New South Wales), South and West Australia.
Nest. —Cup-shaped, neat, small ; constructed lightly of fine
greenish grass, matted or intermixed with spiders’ cocoons and
wool; no particular lining inside except a few downy seeds, &c.,
on the bottom ; usually suspended on a parasitical climber, bush,
or small tree. Dimensions over all, inches x 1| inches in
depth ; egg cavity, If inches across x If inches deep.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2-3 ; oval, compressed towards one end ; texture
fine; surface, faint trace of gloss; colour, beautiful, being rich
salmon pink, distinctly blotched and spotted, particularly about
the apex, with rich pinkish-brown and dull grey markings.
Dimensions of a clutch, in parts of an inch—(l) -82 x -61 ; (2)
•82 x -61 ; (3) -81 x -6.
The eggs, like those of the Little Yellow-spotted Honey-eater (P.
gracilis) of Northern Queensland, are amongst the most richly-
coloured of the Ptilotes.
Observations. —This very elegant and attractive Honey-eater,
or, as Gould well named it, the Graceful, has a fair range of
habitat over the drier and more inland provinces from Victoria to
Western Australia, and possibly including New South Wales
adjacent to the River Murray, or the Murray belts where Gould
procured his birds.
I first met this graceful bird in the season of 1880 among a
forest of saplings near Bagshot, Bendigo, where one or two nests
were found suspended in a parasitical creeper ( Cassytha) sup-
ported by small trees—a very secure situation for a small nest.
But the most beautifully-situated nest I ever found of this species,
and one well worthy of such a pretty bird, was in the Mallee
country, suspended in a low Acacia bush, adorned with its golden
store of “ wee furry balls,”
Again, 25th November, 1889,1 met this Honey-eater in Western
Australia, on the coast at Woodman Point, about 8 miles from
Fremantle. There in a splendid shining clump of Eucalypts, the
species of which I did not learn, a boy pointed out to me a nest
suspended in a swaying branch. The late Mr. Roby Woods, in
whose company I was, drove the buggy underneath; standing
upon the seat I easily secured the nest, which contained one egg,
while the pretty birds protested fearlessly, showing to perfection
their graceful figures and lengthened yellow plumes upon their
necks. I also noticed the same kind of birds flitting about the
gum-trees in the town of Fremantle, where they seemed quite at
home, as much so as its White-plumed compeer does in the gardens
about Melbourne.
Breeding months, August or September to December.

zone of a deeper tint at the larger end, and the whole freckled
with minute spots of a still darker hue; ten lines (-83 inch) long
by seven lines (-58 inch) broad (Gould).
Observations. —The range of the Yellow-fronted Honey-eater
extends more northerly than its close ally the Yellow-plumed, both
in east and west Australia. Ido not recollect seeing the bird in
Victoria. All the specimens collected by Gilbert were from the
York District, in Western Australia, where it inhabits the White-
gum forests, breeding from October to January.

Mr. G. A. Keartland, of the Calvert Exploration Expedition,
when on the Fitzroy River, with regard to this beautiful Honey-
eater, noted : —“ During the warm days of December and January
these birds came to the water-trough in such numbers to drink and
bathe as to completely line the trough. They seem to be exactly
similar in habits to the P. penicillata (White-plumed Honey-eater),
spending their time bathing, chasing each other, and seeking
insects or pollen from the blossom amongst the Eucalypt foliage.
The sexes are alike in plumage, and can only be distinguished by
dissection. They were just building their nests when we left the
locality, in March.”

In the “Catalogue” of the Australian Museum we find it recorded
that Mr. J. A. Boyd forwarded the nest and eggs of the Yellow
Honey-eater which he found, 10th January, 1890, in his plantation,
Herbert River. The nest was mostly composed of the hair-like
fibre of the cocoanut palm, and was suspended by the rim to the
thin leafy twigs of a Cumquat (orange) tree. Mr. Boyd also stated
that all the nests he took were mostly composed of cocoanut fibre.
Two nests were built in a species of Ficus, and were 18 feet from
the ground; another was built in a Mango about 8 feet from the
ground.

Geographical Distribution. —North-west Australia, Northern
Territory and North Queensland, also New Guinea.
Nest. —Cup-shaped; composed of strips of light brownish-coloured
bark, matted with yellowish or golden cocoons of spiders ; inside
lined with a good ply of exceedingly fine grass, with a few fine
Casuarina needles on the bottom ; usually suspended to a forked

tree near a stream. Dimensions over all, 3-4 inches by 2| inches
in depth ; egg cavity, 2-2-j- inches across by 2 inches deep.
Eggs. — Clutch 2; oval, compressed slightly towards one end;
texture fine ; surface, faint trace of gloss; colour, warm or deli-
cate pinkish-white, with large blotches and spots of beautiful light
pinkish and purplish-red, the markings being fairly distributed
but more inclined to congregate around the upper quarter. Most
resembles those of the Yellow Honey-eater (P. flava) type.
Dimensions of a clutch in parts of an inch, (1) ‘BB x '65 ; (2)
•86 x -64.
Observations. —This modest-coloured Honey-eater is a denizen of
the northern part of Australia. Gilbert discovered it in the Port
Darwin district. The situations, where it was usually observed,
were those adjacent to swampy thickets, where it was seen gener-
ally in pairs, and, exceedingly lively.
I have found the White-gaped Honey-eater as far south as
Townsville, where I took birds, nests and eggs on Stuart Creek.
The day following the discovery of the Yellow Honey-eater’s nest
(22 September, 1885), I discovered this other, which was also new.
The nest was suspended by the rim to a forked twig of a thickly
foliaged tree, and contained two eggs perfectly fresh. Previously


I had found a nest in the upper forked branches of a similar tree.
This nest contained a pair of fully-fledged young, for which the
parents were very solicitous, and gave me a good opportunity of
identifying the species.

Eggs. —Clutch 3 ; oval, slightly compressed towards one end ;
texture of shell fine ; surface very slightly glossy ; colour, delicate
fleshy tint, darker on the apex, which is boldly spotted and marked,
usually in the form of a belt, with rich pinkish-red or reddish-
chestnut, and dull purplish-brown or grey. Dimensions in parts of

A set taken in Victoria are smaller in size, and beautiful for their
delicate character and lovely markings, measure —(1) '75x54 ; (2)
•73 x -54; (3) -72 x -55.
Observations. —This splendid little Honey-eater dwells in the
depths of forests, especially where the thick undergrowth grows
in moist or swampy places, or in mountain water-courses. The
bird has a range from South Queensland to Tasmania.
It seems a misnomer to call the bird Tasmanian, for although
it is numerous on that island, it is by no means uncommon in
favoured localities on the mainland. The black lunar-shaped mark
down each side of the breast of the male naturally suggests
“ Crescent” or “ Horse-shoe” as a more appropriate and at once
distinctive name for this Honey-eater,
The female is, however, destitute of the horse-shoe markings, a
fact in favour of separating the species, as it was formerly, under
the genus Lichmera, from the Meliornes , which have the sexes
alike in plumage.


The first nest I found of the Crescent Honey-eater was in 1879
in dense Ti-tree scrub that marked the course of Scotchman’s Creek,
near Oakleigh. Unfortunately it contained young. Guided by
the cue for time and place, the following season (in September),
almost in the exact spot, I found another nest, prettily situated a
foot or two from the ground in a bunch of graceful coral fern
(Gleichenia) that was supported by the scrub, containing a richly
coloured clutch of three eggs.
Writing from Tasmania, Mr, A. E. Brent says; “We rarely
come across more than three eggs to a nest of this little bird, but
I on one occasion took four eggs from a nest in the head of bracken
ferns at Austin’s Ferry, November, 1885.”

Observations. —Gould’s initial genus of the numerous family of
Australian Honey-eaters is peculiar to the southern parts of the
continent. On account of their great love for Banksia trees they
might have been fitly called Banksian-birds,
The species under notice, commonly called the New Holland
Honey-eater, has its focus of numbers in Victoria and Tasmania,


occasionally found four to a clutch in Tasmania.

The coastal scrubs of Leptospermum (Ti-tree) interspersed with
Banksias are the delight of the familiar New Holland, where its
loud, shrill, and scolding note is always heard. -It regales itself I ' n;talice '
on the nectar of the flowering cones or “ honey-suckles ” as they
were first called of the Banksias, while through half the year
individuals may be found nesting in the warm Ti-tree scrub. 11

when that scrub is intersected with belts of dwarf Melaleuca 1 I pimens
(Ti-tree) bearing puce-coloured flowers. In such country I found || x i
two nests with a pair of eggs each during October, 1884, |j| gy
The principal breeding months are from August to December jl wegter

my friend and sportsman, Mr. J. F. Bradly, while shooting at I

Observations. —The Long-billed Honey-eater is the beautiful
western variety of the familiar New Holland Honey-eater. It has
been found as far east as Encounter Bay (S.A.). Dr. Ramsay, in
his “List of Australian Birds,” assigns the bird to the New South
Wales and Wide Bay District columns, and makes the bird a
sub-species. No doubt the New Holland Honey-eater and the
Long-billed are very closely allied ; but to see the respective birds
at home, as 1 have enjoyed doing, there appear characteristic
differences even in their voices, not to mention the specific dis-
tinction of the longer bill of the western bird.
In the recesses of the western forests I found many nests and
eggs which agree with Gilbert’s original description of those of the
bird, which is locally called, the “ Yellow-wing.” The birds are
numerous and frisky about the under scrub, chirping like chickens,
or nerhaps may be seen turning somersaults from some swaying
bough after insect prey. The nests are usually placed a foot or
two from the ground in a thick, low, bush, such as an Acacia.
The birds sat closely, in many instances letting me almost place
toy hand upon them. Sometimes at my approach a pretty bird
settling well down in its nest would ominously watch me with its
pearly-white eyes.
Breeding season, July to December, the principal months being
the last three.

The eggs of the White-cheeked Honey-eater in my collection, to leave t
which I described (1883) on the authority of Dr. A. E. Cox, were when I o
taken in Sutton Forest, Illawarra.
Mr. North informsus that the nest of the White-cheeked Honey- ,
eater is usually placed in the fork of a Banksia or Hakea, partly
resting with the rim of the nest attached to the branches holding
it in position, but it is often found in orange trees in gardens, in
which case the nest is always suspended by the rim.
Breeding season, June to November, and probably later. *,■

branched bush of about 2 or 3 feet in height, in a scrub of sapling

Eggs. —Clutch, 2 usually; moderately lengthened in form;
texture of shell fine ; surface without gloss; colour, pale buft,
darker on the apex, around which is a belt of fine spots of reddish-

Observations.— The Moustached Honey-eater is an inhabitant of
Western! Australia, where, as Gould states, it beautifully repre-
sents the White-cheeked Honey-eater of the eastern coast.
The Moustached Honey-eater is fairly abundant in the scrubs
about Perth Waters, and especially on the scrubby limestone hills
in the vicinity of Fremantle. In both these localities I observed
the birds which were remarkably shy compared with their Long-
billed brethren of the Cape Leeuwin forests. I also discovered a
nest building but did not obtain the eggs. The nest was con-
structed of Melaleuca (Ti-tree) bark, rimmed with fine dead twigs
and lined with soft portions of Banksia cones (two varieties) and
other soft seeds. However, eggs taken by a young local acquaint-
ance the following season (8 Oct., 1890) reached me safe y.
Gilbert found this species an early breeder, young birds ready
to leave the nest having been seen on the Bth August. The time
when I observed the nest building was towards the end of Novem-
ber. Therefore, we may infer that the breeding season is from
the’end of June or the beginning of July to December.

Observations. —Capt. Grant, when in Western Port, Victoria,
1801, wrote : —“ Among the birds noticed was the Bell-bird which
has a note not unlike the tinkling of a bell, so that when a number
of these birds are collected together, the noise they make is similar
to that made by the bells of a team of horses.”
“ Softer than slumber, and sweeter than singing,
The notes of the bell-birds are running and ringing.”— [Kendall.)
Some romance and sentiment have been attached to the Bell-
bird which is a type of Honey-eater wearing an aesthetic yellowish-
olive plumage, but has not the sprightly appearance of the Oreoica
—the Bell-bird of the drier provinces of the interior.
Bell Minah is a good vernacular name, because the bird is closely
connected with the Myzanthce; moreover the name serves to dis-
tinguish it from the other Bell-bird. Yet the Bell Minah is lively
enough in its actions, and is for ever examining in a most inquisi-
tive manner and picking at the green gum foliage in search of
food. A querist writes: —“ The great curiosity of the Bell-bird
to my idea is ‘ What does it feed upon ? ’ It picks continuously
at the back of the gum leaves in the same trees from year to year,
and although I have crept to within a few yards of them when
feeding on the Apple and Yellow-box scrub, and plucked the leaves
afterwards and examined them, I could discover nothing. Per-
haps it sucks a saccharine matter off the leaves, like Swainson’s
Lorikeet and the King Parrot do off the Stringybarks at certain
seasons of the year. I should like someone who has studied the
birds to kindly answer this.”
The Bell Minah is very local, is gregarious to an extent, living
in companies in certain restricted areas chiefly near water or
humid swampy tracts in South Queensland, New South Wales,
and Victoria.
In the early days of the colony of Victoria Bell-birds used to
exist in the timber along the course of the Werribee River and on
the Yarra above Hawthorn. The birds were never destroyed, yet
they have mysteriously disappeared—probably removed to other
forest retreats—notably to Gippsland, where from trees and scrub
in certain favoured localities in summer or winter, in wet weather
or dry, from sunrise to sunset, may be heard the incessant tinkling

voices of scores of birds. In no place I have ever visited are the
Bell-birds more numerous than along the wooded slopes and dark
gullies on the northern shores of Lake King.
On the subject of the departure of Bell-birds Mr. Issac Batey,
of Sunbury, writing to The AtLstralasian, states; “As regards birds
that have left here one was the Bell-bird with its clear metallic
ringing notes. This delightful little bird was very numerous on
all the creeks years ago, and gradually dwindled away till there
were only six of them left down the river, 9 miles from our house.
This was in 1854 when those last of the Mohicans one day came
flying up stream, and we boys remarked, *lt is good-bye to the
Bell-birds,’ a supposition that proved quite correct, as I have not
seen a single one of them since on the whole length of Jackson’s
Creek.” Mr. Batey was inclined to the belief that the coming of
the Butcher-bird, which he said arrived from a westerly point
about 1850, and was unknown in the district before, had some-
thing to do with the clearance of the Bell-birds.
We are aware that if the breeding grounds of birds are inter-
fered with the birds will desert the place. So it is, I fancy, the
case with the Bell-birds. They breed near the ground in low scrub
and saplings underneath their particular food-trees. Therefore,
when the country became stocked, cattle roamed and camped in
these sequestered avenues, and so being disturbed the delightful
birds departed.
At Metung, on Lake King, I was encamped for ten days or a
fortnight when the majority of the Bell-birds appeared to have
nested very early. In the middle of October, 18fel, I found a
the season’s birds fully fledged and flying with their respective
parents. I could not find a single nest containing eggs, although
I found a great number of old nests, sometimes two or more in a
bush Any site seemed to be chosen for the nest, from scrub anc
bushes 12 feet high down to the common bracken fern. Some
of the nests were the crudest and simplest of all Honey-eaters J
am acquainted with, being constructed of just sufficient materials
to ensure the safety of the eggs, and suspended by the rim to any
convenient twig. The nests are sometimes patched and inter-
woven with portions of moss and lichen.
However, the same season Mr. B. A. Poole, who lived in the
locality, secured for me several clutches of the second broods, also
some of the early ones the following season, which were originally
described before the Field Naturalists’ Club of Victoria
From some interesting observations on the Bell-bird sent to
The Australasian, February, 1894, by a correspondent ‘ A.J.B )
at Metung, I extract the following“ They make their nests
usually in the fronds of the bracken fern, or in the low Dogwood
scrub, making little attempt at concealment. I think the Bell-
birds must lose a lot of their eggs and young ones through snakes,


as I have seen dozens o£ empty nests tilted over on the one side
as though the snake had supported itself whilst helping itself to a
delicate mouthful. During nesting-time the birds are bolder than
ever, and will not hesitate to attack a dog if he ventures too near
the youngsters. Several times when forcing my way through the
scrub on hands and knees to try and see the Lyre-bird dancing on
the mound, I have been defeated by getting too near their nests,
as they at once set up their call, and in a few minutes dozens of
them were flying around me, which was so good a hint to the
Lyre-bird that it at once stopped its mimicking or whistling and
made itself scarce.”
Riding along the Murray frontage, near the Moira Lake, early
(at sunrise) one April morning, I was agreeably surprised to hear
from the living lines of gums that protected the river the voices
of numerous Bell-birds. I hardly expected to find these birds so
far inland, and I drew rein to listen to the chiming of the “ ting-
ting ” notes that were piercing the ci’isp air of that delightful
morn.
Then away in the sub-tropical parts of New South Wales, near
the Tweed River, I have another pleasant reminiscence of Bell-
birds, I recollect hearing their voices floating through a splendid
forest of Ironbarks (Eucalypts) and Pines, where tree-orchids with
clusters of yellowish flowers beamed from the trees as we passed
in the coach, while the ground scrub around was rendered
attractive by the presence of the stately figures of fern-trees,
palms, and cycads.
The Darling Downs (Q.), is probably the most northerly habitat
of the birds. Here I must give you Mr. Hermann Lau’s own
description taken from his MS. :
“ Bell-bird.—The outskirts of the so-called cedar scrubs have
often favoured water tracts emerging either from the thickets or
are kept in rocky enclosures. Here is where these interesting
birds gather in numbers, sending forth their short, varied, bell-
like notes, which tell the stray and thirsty wanderer that water
is near.
*******
In clumps and circles of prickly shrub belonging to the Solanaceous
family adapted much by the lichens, the Bell-bird resorts for
nidification. Often have I found three nests in one little bush,
advantage being taken of the lichens—the only material used for
building purposes, except the lining, which is taken from a fibrous
tree. The eggs are two, rarely three. Highfields, 22 miles north
of Toowoomba, October, 1875.”
There is, of course, a focus to the breeding season of the Bell-
bird, probably August or September, but like many other honey-
eaters some breed early, others late. Some years ago Dr. D’Om-
brain took a Bell-bird’s nest after Easter, while a relation of Dr.

Snowball took a pair of eggs the first week of May (? April), 1896,
at Drouin, and shot the parent bird for his collection. The same
season, in another part of Gippsland, a correspondent of Mr, 0.
FTench, jun., noticed young birds at the end of June.
On the other hand, Mr. Geo. H. Morton, who was enjoying his
summer vacation at Gippsland Lakes, reported he had found a
nest of the Bell-bird containing eggs, New Year’s Day, 1889.
Therefore, between these two extremes may be taken the breeding
season of the Bell-bird.

Observations.— The fanniliar Minah, or, as it is called in some
parts, the Soldier-bird, is one of the most common of our Honey-
eaters. Wherever you meet the birds, whether near the coastal
scrub, in belts of timber along a river, on a plain, or in the
Mallee, by their scolding voices they at once make their presence
known, and yours too, should you happen to be stalking upon
rarer game. However common and annoying the birds may be, the
shapely-built nest and reddish-coloured eggs are both very beautiful.
Two eggs I took from a nest near that grand natural sight
Corra Linn, Tasmania—were slightly larger than those genera y
taken in Victoria. This agrees with Goulds observations that
the Minah in Tasmania is a more robust bird and larger in every
respect than the same species found on the mainland.


General breeding months are from July or August to December ;
but it has been noticed in Queensland when some of the birds
built early, in July or August, only one or a pair of eggs are laid
as against a clutch of three or four laid when the season is more
advanced and there is a great supply of food. Young Minahs
have been seen in the nest on the Paroo, N.S.W., as late as April.
Mr. Lau discovered at Warroo (Q.), a “poor soldier” hanging
dead, having been strangled with a long horsehair, which the bird
had been evidently conveying to its nest.
This Minah’s nest is sometimes the receptacle for the smaller,
flesh-coloured egg of the Pallid Cuckoo {Cuculus pallidus). I have
never been fortunate enough myself to discover the strange egg in
the Minah’s nest, but have seen several examples that were taken
from such receptacles in the Ararat district.
The young of the garrulous Minah assume the adult colouring
from the nest.
In 1891 Mr. C, F. Belcher, 8.A., found a Minah’s nest near the
ground, built in long grass and bracken—a somewhat unusual
site.

Observations.— This smaller species may be said to be the great
interior representative of the Manorhince. But outlying or iso ated
families of the Yellow-throated Minah are found in such localities
as Darling Downs, Riverina, and the Lower Murray district, it
has not the exceedingly noisy disposition of its larger cousins.
Mr. Lau observed on the Darling that the Yellow-throated
Minah built higher than the common variety usually did, while
Dr. Ramsay says in N. S. Wales the bird builds in trees and
shrubs, frequently near the ground. , » , ,
During the exploration of the North-west by the unfortunate
Calvert party, Yellow-throated Minahs were frequently seen an
several shot between Lake Way and Separation Well Isolated
pairs were also noted in the sandhills of the desert until nearin
the Fitzroy River. The late Mr. G. L. Jones the youthful
explorer—the first of the two lost ones to succumb to the burning
d esert-took a clutch of three eggs of this Minah during August
(1896) a short distance north of Lake Augusta.

and a few feathers. Dimensions over all, 6-7 inches ; egg cavity,

a tall tree.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2-3 ; nearly oval, compressed towards one end ;

with rich reddish-brown, and dull purplish-grey. Dimensions of
clutches in inches, eastern examples, (1) D 26 x -9; (2) D 25 x '92,
Examples from Western Australia are usually rounder in form,
ground colour a lighter pinkish tone, and are smaller in size,
(1) 1-16 x -87 ; (2) M 5 x -86.
Observations. —The restless and shy Wattle-bird is found chiefly
in the coastal regions, from South Queensland round to Western
Australia, and is regarded as a common species. They are good
eating—lo birds averaged 4+ oz. in weight. My first experience
of the bird was many yeai’S ago, when I took its fovely, salmon-
pink eggs in Albert Park, near Melbourne. Since I have taken
their nests in such places as Mistletoe on Gum-trees in the
Brighton and Oakleigh districts, in the open, prickly Bursaria
bushes, in the Mallee, as well as in bushy trees in Western Aus-
tralia.
In Mr. Lau’s Queensland (South) note he says ;—“ I have seen
the Wattle, or Gill-bird, near the Pacific, where Honeysuckles
(Banksia) or sandy ground abound ; nevertheless, as such trees are
often abundantly to be seen towards the interior, this bird has
found them out, and there is where I have met with nests, which
were situated mostly on the top of a slender sapling. Nests
formed of dry sticks, and rootlets inside; eggs, 2-3, mostly the
latter number.” My own experience in the south is that the eggs


are usually a pair, although I possess records of having taken two
nests with each three eggs. I was able to verify Gilbert’s cute
observation, that the nests of the Wattle-bird in Western Aus-
tralia were usually built without lining.
In the years 1853-60, I am told, Wattle-birds were very
plentiful at Frenchmen’s Amphitheatre, Warrnambool, and other
places in the western district of Victoria, where seventy birds might
be easily shot in a morning.
Mr. J. Sommers, Cheltenham, reported that he had found the
single egg of the Pallid Cuckoo in a Wattle-bird’s nest, 28-9—95.
The following “ snake yarn ” is a clipping from a Melbourne
newspaper :—Some years ago, while in Pyalong, my attention
was attracted by the noise and fluttering of a Wattle-bird. I
was surprised to see a snake up a Wattle-tree, in the act of swal-
lowing a fully-feathered bird. His body was balanced on the
limbs near the nest, which was 12 ft. or 13 ft. from the ground.
The bird was slimed all over, and with great effort the snake was
trying to gulp it down head first. I watched the process for some
time, and then despatched the snake. The bird was dead. Isear
the log close by were some feathers (same sort), so I guess the
reptile swallowed two birds. The snake was about 4ft. long; it
had a thick neck, and was dark in colour.”
The breeding months include August to December, but princi-
pally September and October,

Observations. —During three excursions to the different groups
of islands in Bass Straits I noticed this fine large Honey-eater on
King Island only ; therefore, excepting that island, we may inter
32545—E


that the larger Wattle-bird is found nowhere out of Tasmania.
There is just a possibility that we may have missed it on Flinders—■
a large and scrubby island.
This Wattle-bird has a remarkable voice, which has been com-
pared to that of a Blue Mountain Lorrikeet with a cold in its
throat.
Mr. A. E. Brent writes : “On the Barren Plains, at the Great
Lake, these birds build in hundreds; the trees are merely low
bushes. I had ten days’nesting there in December, 1885 or 1886,
and took several nests containing four eggs, also saw many
containing four young birds.”
The Wattle-birds are excellent eating, this species weighing
51 or 6 oz. each.

Observations. —All round the eastern coast and in some portions
of Tasmania, wherever the Banksias flourish there will be heard
the harsh, guttural notes of the Brush Wattle. In such places as
the shores of Lake King, Gippsland, and the park-like land near


Ararat, Victoria, I have seen these birds numerous. It was in
the gullies running into the foot-hills of the Pyrenees that I secured
the examples of eggs in ray collection.
Gould mentions that two of the Brush Wattle-bird’s nests and
eggs, forming part of his great collection, were taken from the
shrubs growing near the Botanical Gardens, Sydney, where these
birds in those days were plentiful.

Observations.— My first field-outing in Western Australia was
to Middleton Harbour, part of King George’s Sound. The locality
was simply a repetition of some parts of the shores of Port Phillip
—slightly undulating sandy ridges sustaining Banksias, Acacias,
&c., between the beach, and Ti-tree (Melaleuca) swamps at the back
but the species of the vegetation was changed, likewise some of
the birds, amongst which was the Lunulated Wattle-bird. It was
the last day of September, 1889, and I found three nests in ( J lffe rent
stages—one building, one containing a beautiful egg, and the third
occupied with a young one. All the nests were situated in thick,
silky, or velvet bushes ( Adenanthos ). The week following, in the
same locality, I took another nest with a fresh egg._ Then on the
west coast, towards the end of November, I obtained two more
nests, each containing a single egg—one in the Karndale forest
and the other at Coogee, near Fremantle. Incubation had com-
menced in both these instances. , ,
The singular circumstances mentioned by Gilbert that the
Lunulated Wattle-bird laid but one egg was proved in the five
nests I found.

round pieces of greenish grass, interwoven or matted with spider’s
web, some with the addition of a few cocoons; scantily lined on
the inside bottom with wool and such like material, in some in-
stances there is no particular lining; usually suspended by the rim
in a bush—Acacia, &c.—or swaying branch of Casuarina or other
low tree, in open forest. Dimensions over all, 4-5 inches by 2J
inches in depth; egg cavity, 2|-3 inches across by lf-2 inches deep.
Eggs. —Clutch, 2-3 ; oval, compressed and pointed at one end ;
texture,fine; surface,glossy; colour, light olive, moderatelymarked,
but more thickly about the apex with umber and dull grey spots.
Dimensions of a clutch in inches—(l) I*o6 x ‘76; (2) I*ol x *74.
Another pair—(l) DO6 x *72; (2) I*os x *72.
These eggs are quite an exception to the usual character of
colouring for Honey-eaters’, and more resemble types of the Yellow-
breasted Thickheads ( Pachycephalce).
Observations. —Probably no Australian Honey-eater is more
interesting and pleasing than the elegant Spiny-cheeked. Its
geographical range extends from Southern Queensland down south
and across to Western Australia. It may be regarded as an inland
species, but in winter it moves towards the seaboard, and is a
visitor to the parks, cemeteries, &c., around Melbourne, Geelong,
&c., where its peculiar gurgling call may be frequently heard.
The earliest I have heard the Spiny-cheeked Honey-eater about
Melbourne (exact locality, Armadale), has been the 22nd May.
The latest I have heard them being the Ist September, in the
Botanical Gardens. About September these birds commence to
return inland to their breeding haunts, which in some instances
are not far away.
In October, 1882, I found two nests in the Mallee, near Nhill,
Victoria. One was in an Acacia bush within reach. It was then
building, the first egg being laid on the 20th, the second three
days afterwards, when the nest was taken. The other nest was
at a height of about 10 feet in an erect Casuarina (Bull-oak). It
was also building. The first egg was deposited on the 18th, then
an egg on each- of the two following days. Full clutch, three.


Nearer home, on the Upper Werribee, November, 1890, with
the Messrs. Brittlebank, I found two more Spinies’ nests, as we
called them. One was most charmingly situated in a wreath of
feathery seeding Clematis that adorned a bushy Acacia, the other
being situated in a shapely Native Cherry-tree {Exocarpus). Dates,
Bth and 11th respectively.
The Messrs. Brittlebank have found the nests of the bpmy-
cheeked Honey-eater in the following trees and shrubs, namely :
Bursaria, Leptospermum, Dodonsea, Casuarina, Exocarpus, and in
another tree that grows by the river bank which they forgot the
botanical name of ; also in Clematis and Loranthus,

1 Observations.— This large and splendid Honey-eater a
goodly range, chiefly throughout the eastern half of Australia,
and especially along the rivers of the interior. _
It may be considered an inland species, and in Wctona it does
not pass the Dividing Range—the southern limit of its habitat.


Gould, who says this attractive and beautiful Honey-eater is one
of the finest of our indigenous Meliphagidce , gives us a refreshing
mental picture when he writes : —“ I have frequently seen eight
or ten of these bold and spirited birds on a single tree, displaying
the most easy and elegant movements, clinging and hanging in
every variety of positions, frequently at the extreme ends of the
small, thickly-flowered branches, bending them down with their
own weight. They may be easily distinguished from other birds
with which they are frequently in company by their superior size,
the brilliancy of their blue face, and the contrasted colours of
their plumage.”
I had an opportunity of proving the curious fact mentioned by
Gould of the Blue-faced Honey-eater depositing its eggs in the
deserted nest of the Chatterer ( Pomatostomus ). In the beginning
of September, 1881, in the Bendigo district, I was wending my
way along a track through timber—in fact, I had lost my road—
when I observed a splendid Blue-face in a small tree. There was
also an old Pomatostomus nest in the tree. I recollected Gould’s
remarks, and ascended to prospect. In the crown of the large stick
nest I found embedded a round, open, bark-made nest, containing
a large and lovely pair of the Honey-eater’s eggs.
Gould further remarks, “that in places where no substitute is to
be found, the Blue-face makes a nest like other species of its tribe.”
On the 16th October, 1885, when at Coomooboolaroo, Queens-
land, with Mr. Harry Barnard, I had an opportunity of observing
a nest suspended in a Eucalypt, which was owned, and apparently
built by the Blue-faced Honey-eater, and from which we took a
specimen of that bird’s eggs. The nest resembled that of an Oriole,
or Eriar-bird, only was not so heavily constructed.
Mr. Harry Barnard’s experience is that “ In nine cases out of
ten the Entomyza breeds in another bird’s nest, mostly in old nests
of Pomatostomi ; but the entrance is always enlarged, and the
Entomyza builds its own nest inside, lining it with stems of dry
grass, like the inside of a Friar-bird’s nest.
“When the Entomyza builds its own nest independently, it very
closely resembles that of a Friar-bird; but is more loosely con-
structed. A pair once built close to our cow-shed, and obtained
the material for it about the house. We had a quantity of rails
(Lance-wood or Bastard Brigalow) about, which had the outside
bark taken off. The birds pulled off the inner bark in strips for
their nest.”
Mr. Thos. R. McDougall, Claremont, (Q.) writes:—l have seen
them (Entorayzas) breeding in the deserted nest of the Leather-
head ; have also seen them build a nest similar to that of the
Leather-head (Friar-bird).
During a delightful excursion to the Lower Murray, beginning
of November, 1892, Mr. J, Gabriel and I found a Blue-faced


Honey-eater’s nest in the topmost branches of a small Red-gum by
the river. Our host, Mr, G. H. Morton, climbed the tree for the
pair of eggs. After a consultation the three of us agreed that the
nest had evidently been constructed by the bird itself. Mr.
Morton, 3rd December, following year took another nest, appar-
ently made by the Entomyza. Clutch, two eggs.
Mr. A. J. North, although he has not recorded having taken a
nest of the Entomyza, says ; “ I have never heard of this bird
constructing a nest itself, but relines the deserted tenements of
Myzantha garrula (Minah) Acanthochcera carunculata (Wattle-
bird), or a depression in the top of the dome-shaped nest of
Pomatostomus temporalis (Chatterer).”
Here is the story of my venerable friend and acute field
observer, Mr. Hermann Lau, respecting the Blue-faced Honey-
eater, from the Dowling Downs (Q.): “It is one of our most hand-
some forest birds, and lively by nature. When other birds The
Soldier ( Minah ), Leatherhead, &c.—are building, this nest-robber
either goes out foraging the material to make its own nestgather-
ing it from its neighbours, or puts itself in possession of their whole
edifice —that is, supposing the neighbour is a weaker bird, and
before the latter deposits its eggs. Once I witnessed a sight never
to be forgotten. A Butcher-bird when returning with building
stuff found an Entomyza deftly pulling away at its (the Butcher-
bird’s) property. The Butcher-bird drove off the other and kept
it at bay, when to its horror the mate of the Entomyza arrived to
help at the thievish work. Evidently a thought struck the Butcher-
bird, so that it placed itself in the middle of the nest, which enabled
that bird with its formidable beak to put both enemies to flight.
Such is the habit of the Entomyza, the sequel being that its nest
is like that of a Minah {Myzantha), in which 2-3 eggs are placed,
and is hung fairly high. Two broods. September, lb (4.
Breeding month, August to January, and sometimes, Mr.
North states, as late as February.

Observations. —This large, and remarkable Honey-eater,with its
curious appearance and chattering calls, is not only well-known in
collections, but likewise to all bush folk. It ranges over much of
Australian forest and open country alike, west and north excepted.
Gould regarded the Eriar-bird as a summer visitant to the more
southern limit of its range. Probably he was correct, and that its
visits are regulated by seasons, and the blossoming of various
Eucalypts. One season (about 1870) these birds were in great
numbers in the district of Spring vale, Victoria, and no doubt in
other localities contiguous. The forest everywhere resounded with
their vocality. We shot as many birds for the table as our bags
could conveniently hold. If a bird were wounded we soon learnt
to be careful of its bill and powerful claws,
I shall always recollect my first Leather-head’s nest, which I
took as a boy. On the 9th November, of the season mentioned,
we found a nest building, or about ready for eggs, in a medium-
sized tree near Fern-tree Gully, at the base of the Dandenongs. A
fortnight afterwards we walked from what is now Armadale to the
ranges and back in one day—4s miles—for the precious set of
eggs. Of course we also found other species of eggs—Thickhead’s,
Eantail’s, Robin’s, &c.
We started about 4 o’clock a.m., when a waning moon and the
bright morning star gave the eastern sky an additional charm.
When we got beyond Malvern (Gardiner in those days), we


overtook a spring-cart drawn by a restive colt. In the vehicle there
sat a boy crying bitterly. In answer to our questions he said his
father had got drunk or was locked up, and begged us to take him
(the boy) home to Oakleigh. Taking compassion upon the lad
(which also would give us a lift on our way), we saw all safely to
the house, and placed the position of affairs before his mother.
But just imagine our intense surpi’ise, when, instead of receiving
her gratitude for our little trouble, she scattered us with a stick,
informing us that in future we had better mind our business.
What subsequently happened to the poor boy, and to the “old man'
when he returned home, was not left for me to record.
Gould states the Friar-bird commences breeding in November,
when the birds become animated and fierce, readily attacking
Hawks, Crows, and Magpies, or other larger birds that may venture
within the precincts of the nest, never desisting from the attack
until they are driven a considerable distance. So numerous did
Gould find the Friar-bird breeding in the Apple-tree (. Angophora )
Flats, near Aberdeen and Yarrundi, on the Upper Hunter, New
South Wales, that he remarks the birds might almost be termed
gregarious. _ .
I take the following interesting notes relating to the Friar-bird
from Mr. Hermann Lau’s MS. “ Not gaudy in plumage, never-
theless of great interest. With it everything is odd. The tongue,
unique in itself, expresses laughable articulations. The naked
cowl-like head looks ridiculous. Impudent and daring, it steals
material for its nest whenever a chance offers. The wool-shed of
a station is very handy, where it finds twine and wool. It was at
Yandilla (Q.) where I found a nest wholly constructed of these
two articles. At another place (Warroo) the greater part of a nest
was, I believe, about R). of twine. This stuff the bird wound
within and out and round the neighbouring branches, at the same
time sewing it into a substantial grass nest padded with wool.
Far from habitation, it takes for its nest the produce of land—dry
grass—save now and then you will see a string or ribbon inter-
woven and dangling down. The Leatherhead is a bold orchard
robber, and, approaching the site of its nest, it darts down like a
Magpie, inflicting harm with bill and claws, whenever opportunity
offers. I once killed such an infuriated bird with a stick. Breeds
twice in a season, laying 3-5 eggs. Partly migratory. All over
the Darling Downs. Nests generally in October.
Breeding months, end of September to December.

Observations. —This fine bird is restricted, as far as is known,
to Northern Queensland, including the Gulf of Carpentaria district,
where it represents the ordinary Friar-bird of southern latitudes.
In 1893, in the Bloomfield River district, Mr. D. Le Souef found
the Helmeted Friar-bird numerous, where it commenced nest-
building about the end of October. He was presented with a
splendid nest by Mr. T, A. Gulliver, who obtained it from Mag-
netic Island, near Townsville. This example, together with three
eggs (there were originally five), found their way into my collection.
The nest seemed to have been attached to mangroves.
Mr. Harry Barnard, while collecting al Cape York, found many
nests with beautiful sets of eggs during the months of November,
December, and January.

Previous Descriptions of Eggs. —Campbell, Southern Science
Record (1883). North, Cat. Nests and Eggs, Austn. Mus., p. 219
(1889).
Geographical Distribution. —Northern Territory (?), Queensland,
New South Wales, Victoria, South and West Australia.
Nest. —Cup-shaped ; loosely constructed ; composed of grasses
(dry and green), tine twigs, wool, cocoons, &c. ; inside lined with
fine, dry grass; usually suspended from a pendulous branch of a
Eucalypt, sometimes near or overhanging water, in open forest.
Dimensions over all, 5 inches by 6 inches in depth; egg cavity,
3 inches across by 2| inches deep.
Eggs. —Clutch, 3-4, one instance 5 ; nearly oval, slightly com-
pressed towards one end ; texture tine ; slight trace of gloss on
surface; colour, pinkish or purplish-buff, indistinctly smudged or
blotched with umber, and chiefly light purplish-brown. Dimensions
in inches of two from a clutch taken in Riverina: (1) DO9 x
•77 ; (2) DO7 x -76. A clutch of three from Central Queensland
are of a pinker coloured buff, and more distinctly blotched and
spotted with chestnut or reddish-brown and purplish-brown—(l)
M x -75 ; (2) DO7 x -76; (3) DOS x -75.
Observations. —This smaller and plain-coloured Friar-bird is a
dweller of almost the whole of the great interior tract of Australia
suited to its habits, except, perhaps, west and north-west.
My introduction to this species was in November, 1877, at
Wentworth, on the Darling River, where the birds, with chattering
voices, were ravishing the bell-shaped flowers of imported trees
(.Lagunaria ) that bordered the shrubs. On the Prince of Wales’
Birthday, when a picnic of the towns-folk was being held up the
river, having proceeded thither by steamboat, I found my “record
nest within reach in a bough overhanging the river-bed. The
eao-s, however, were much incubated. Another nest I found sub-
sequently was placed in a low “ Box ” (Eucalypt) and contained
a lovely fresh set of three richly coloured eggs.
From Mr. Hermann Lau’s, MS., I take “ Mocking-bird (P.
citreogularis'). It is not unlike the ordinary species with the
exception of being smaller and having no protuberance over the
bill root. Its nest is more simply made from dry grass with
rootlets for a lining. The site chosen for the cradle is the dense
foliage of an Apple-tree (Eucalypt), not high up. The number of
the eggs is always four. Found in open forest on the Darling
Downs, Tummaville, October, 1868.”
Breeding months, September to December.

Previous Description of Eggs. —Ramsay, P.L.S.N.S. W., vol.
vii, p. 52 (1882).
Geographical Distribution. — North-west Australia, Northern
Territory, and Queensland (probably).
Nest. —Cup-shaped ; constructed of bark and grass, suspended
by the rim to the forked twigs at the end of some horizontal or
drooping branch. In size about half that of the P. corniculatus
or equal to that of P. citreogularis (Ramsay).
Eggs. —Clutch, 3-4; rich salmon-red, spotted with a darker tiiii,
some of the spots fleecy, confluent, and distributed alike all over
the surface of the shell, rather closer near the thicker end, but
not forming a row there ; in A a few confluent on the thick end
forming a blotch on the top of the egg. In B the spots are more
scattered and obsolete markings of pale lilac are disposed here and
there over the surface. Length (A) LO4 xl 7 inch; (B) LOS x
*75 (Ramsay).
Observations.- —This northern Friar-bird is very similar to the
Yellow-throated, the more southern and interior species, but is
smaller in all its measurements except the bill which is larger.
In the neighbourhood of the Fitzroy River, North-west Australia,
Mr. G. A. Keartland observed many of the nests of this Friar-
bird, but only two eggs were obtained. The nests were usually
made of coarse grass, cup-shaped, and were placed in the drooping
foliage of a Eucalypt.
Dr. Ramsay gives the habitat as far south as the Dawson River
district, and described the nest and eggs from the collection of the
Messrs. Barnard of that locality, who, however, are not aware
that that particular species is found in their neighbourhood.

“Western Friar-bird.”

Reference. —Ramsay, P.L.S.N.S.W., vol. ii, 2nd series (1887).
Geographical Distribution. —North-west Australia.
Nest and Eggs. —Unknown,
Observations. —With regard to this doubtful species Dr. Ramsay
says it is “ similar to P. sordidus , juv., but having the sides of
neck and chest tinged with citrous-yellow.” Mr. G. A. Keart-
land, at Derby, North-west Australia, shot a bird answering this
description. He says, “ Whether another species or simply a
variation in plumage I was unable to determine. It was being
constantly attacked by the other Friar-birds which were numerous
in the locality where it was shot.”
