Of WAANILTIE, one of the four BLACK-FELLOWS
Executed at Franklin Harbor , on the 10 January, 1856.
At the criminal sittings of the Supreme Court, held at
Adelaide on the 4th December, 1855, before Mr. Justice
Booth by, Waaniltie, Pangulta, Nullalta, and Winbalta,
four aboriginal natives of Port Lincoln, were charged
with the murder of Peter Brown, a shepherd in the
employ of Messrs. MacKechnie, at Middlecamp station,
Franklin Harlior, on the 4th of June last. There was
also a case of sheep-stealing connected with this event,
in which three native females and two youths were
implicated, but these were discharged for want of suffi-
cient evidence.
apprehended on the 23rd of July, with the clothes of the
murdered man in their possession, but managed to make
their escape and remain in obscurity for three months,
when they were recaptured and taken to Adelaide gaol.
His Honor having summed up, dismissed the Jury
to consider their verdict. After the lapse of a few
minutes, the Jury returned into Court and pronounced
each of the prisoners guilty.
The prisoners were then removed, the sentence being
deferred. On the 7th of December they were again
brought forward, and His Honor, addressing them
through an interpreter, expressed his regret that he was
unable, on that solemn occasion, to make himself under-
stood by the prisoners, and sentenced them to death, as
follows:?? Waaniltie, Pangulta, Nullalta, and Winbalta,
you are each to be taken to the place from whence you
came, and thence to a place of execution within the
province, and there be hanged by the neck till you be
dead!?
The prisoners were examined through an interpreter,
and pleaded not guilty. The Crown Solicitor prosecuted,
and the prisoners were ably defended by Mr. Hartley.
The circumstances of the case, as elicited from the
witnesses examined, are as follows:?On the supposed
day of the murder the natives called at the station and
solicited food and tobacco, which wsis refused them;
they were then seen following the track of the shepherd,
who had previously left the station with some 1,700
sheep. In the evening, the flock returned to the station,
but without the shepherd. This induced the owner of
the sheep to institute a search, and, accompanied by
Police-constables Wood and Smith, he succeeded, by the
aid of three natives of the same tribe as the prisoners,
in tracking the route till they came to the dead laxly of
Brown, which they found hidden beneath some bushes;
and, at about two miles distance from this spot, the
skins of ten sheep were discovered. The natives readily
and distinctly pointed out certain foot-prints, distinguish-
ing those of the prisoners from others.
It appeared, from the examination, that Brown was
returning with the sheep in the evening, and while in
the act of cutting a stick with his knife, Waanilte
thrust a spear into his side, and the others waddied him.
They then dragged the body aside and threw it into a
bush, after which they seized ten sheep from the flock,
and made off?with them towards the sea, where they were
s?en by one of the witnesses, a native youth named
Bennaialienu, to kill the sheep with a knife, skin them,
and, with the aid of the liberated native women and boys,
drag the carcases to a place called Winnaroo, where
they made a fire and roasted them. The prisoners were
On the 7th January, 1856, the Government schooner,
?Yatala,? sailed from Port Adelaide, for Port Lincoln,
having on board the Sheriff, his assistants, and the tour
condemned criminal*, accompanied by an escort of
police. The vessel arrived at her destination on the
9th, and on the following morning the dread sentence
was carried into effect, in the presence of the tribe to
which the prisoners belonged.
To the casual observer, the morning was one of sur-
passing loveliness?a gentle shower had fallen on the
previous night, and now the sun was shining, but not too
bright; birds of the most beautiful plumage were flitting
to and fro, warbling their song of joy, and, regaling in
the lilarty of niture, were busily engaged in seeking
food for their young; the fragrance of the air was
unusually sweet and refreshing; but, suddenly, long,
loud, heart-rending shrieks reached the affrighted ear;
it was the death-wail of the poor lubras, the shrieks of
their infant progeny (pickaninies)?the listening ear of
the j>oor deluded, wretched, starving native, had caught
the sound of far-off footsteps, and could distinguish those
of white men among their own friends?the sequel, to
them, was the certain, speedy, and avenging law of
might!?the strong white man?the defenceless black.
CONFESSION AND EXECUTION.
m dear Friends ?Long time wgo, when we were boys, tin? White-man first came to our - hunting grounds. White-man then seemed
plenty good, but, soon, white-fellow all gammon! We were then plenty strong, hut now white-fellow stronger than us. White-fellow
catch biro kangaroo oppoasum, cm*; catch fish in big net; shoot every thing?nothing left for poor black-fellow. Then black-fellow
fï¿½*el plenty hungry, and ask white-fellow for tucker, but white-fellow plenty growl. Then me took white-fellow?s sheep, and white-
fellow got big knife open, a**d one big stick; then me threw spear at white-fellow, and he tumble down! Now they going to hang poor
black-fellow r?The fatal rope was now adjusted, and, byke so many scare-crows, the murderers were soon swinging to ami fro in
mid-air. It is but too true that the black natives are bereft ot their every right and possession, that they hare nothing to inspire them
with hope either present or future as regards this life, and as to another or better world, but few, a very few of them have evar heard?
There?s nothing looming in the distance.
To cheer the heart or glad the eye;
There?* nothin* certain for poor bfacke\.
But the doom that, he must die.
Observe his lubra?wretched creature!
The fair among the fair
Should look upon her for a while.
And see what she doth bear!
At this sad gathering of the tribe to witness the last end of their comrades, there was no wild disorder in attempting to obtain a good
point of view; no cries of 44 all hot here,? or ?sold again and got the money"; no rushing, fighting, swearing, or cursing among these
ignorant and benighted blacks, as among the eager crow d on similar occasions in civilized countries ; no erecting and letting out of seats
on hire; but, instead of this, the miserable, terror-stricken tribe, lay prostrate on the ground, wailing and bemoaning their old friends.
All hungry and sad, as we one day did roam,
In search of opposum or emu for food.
We met with one white man?he?d just left his home?
He?d plenty of tucker, but ah, he no good.
We asked him for bread, or for one little sheen:
? You lazy black fellows." the white man did say,
?? I?ll give you. just nothing, however you weep,
(io, get you gone, and get out of my way."
A big stick he then cut?he?d an open knife too,
And we thought that to kill ns was what he would do;
Then my spear left my hand?it entered his aide?
And the white-man lay down?and qnietly died ?
So now, my dear friends, we shall tumble down too,
Tb* white-fellows will hang us, and you will all view!
| very soon die, hot then, yes, oh then.
? Well tumble down black, and jump up while men.
