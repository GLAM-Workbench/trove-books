Education and Destruction
I suppose it will scarcely be disputed that one of the most
salient characteristics of contemporary society is a profound
feeling of dissatisfaction, malaise, and unrest, producing a
weariness of life which is daily becoming more burdensome,
and from which a good many of us endeavour to escape by
such means of slow suicide and of mental stupefaction as
tobacco, opium, and intoxicating liquors. Never before,
perhaps, was the conviction so highly prevalent that
? Youth is a blunder, manhood a mistake, and old age a re-
gret.? When we come to investigate the causes of this
dreary state of things, we cannot escape the conclusion that
they do not lie outside of ourselves. The visible world is
still magnificent in its grandeur, and exquisite in its loveli-
ness. Wherever civilized man plants his feet, he does Ips
best to deface and to devastate it. ? Wasting and destruc-
tion are in our paths. The way of peace we know hif; and
there is no judgment in our goings.? We exhaust the soil
of virgin lands by our egregious cupidity ; -we strip the
mountains of the forests which cover them with a robe of
beauty, and we never dream of replanting them ; we pollute
with the noisome sewage of our cities the streams which used
to dimple in the breeze and sparkle in the sun ; and we pour


into the sea and block up our harbours with the filth which,
properly applied, would add to the fertility of the earth ;
hut we cannot efface or destroy the majesty of form, and the
splendour of colour which are inherent in this beautiful
world. It still wears its regal garment with a grace and
grandeur which are only partially smirched and marred by
our defacing fingers, and it continues to be an apparition of
glory and delight?a divine idea made visible to us?in spite
of ourselves. As of old, the massive sierras lift up their
dazzling crests of stainless snow into the azure heaven,
flushing with the sunrise, glittering like frosted silver in the
full splendour of the noonday sun, glowing with the hues of
gold at sunset, and fading into wan spectres when the arch
of heaven is powdered with star-dust in the purple midnight.
As of old, the spring comes to us in nature under the aspect
of a perpetually renovated youth, and the summer spreads a
? light of laughing flowers ? over the rejoicing earth, and
autumn heaps upon us her unstinted fruitfulness, and winter
? giveth his beloved sleep.? As of old, the chime of tinkling
rill and ? trotting burn,? the fragrance of the honeysuckle,
the carol of the bird, the hum of bees, ? the lisp of children
and their earliest words,? possess the power to charm, but
may we not say that no man regardeth them ? Is it not
true, as a recent writer has said, that?
? W e carry our sick hearts abroad amidst the joyous things
That through the leafy places glance on many-coloured wings,
They hold us from the woodlark?s haunts and violet dingle?s
back,
And from all the lovely sounds and gleams in the shining
river?s track.
They bar us from our heritage of spring-time, hope and mirth.
And weigh our burden?d spirits down with the cumbering dust
of earth ??
Why is this ? The dissatisfaction I have spoken of is in and
of the mind. It is both the result and the evidence of mental
disorder or disease, and more often than not of mental
vacuity. A morbid craving for excitement pervades all
classes of society, and we find the outcome of it to be fast
men and fast women, fast living, fast travelling, fast litera-
ture, and a fast drama. Life is not an orderly march, but a
swift race. It is not a beautiful procession, hut a wild, helter-
skelter rush of phantom horsemen upon phantom horses ia
pursuit of phantom objects. Many are trodden dowa, man-
gled, maimed, bruised, and killed in the impetuous chase, and
those who are not so, reach the verge of the grave with ex-


ï¿½xausted energies and empty hands. We have lost both the
desire for leisure and the capacity to enjoy it. Our lives
being entirely out of harmony with nature, which is merely
another name for God?s mind in operation for our instruc-
tion and delight, are as miserable and as unsatisfying as they
deserve to be. For what is the one unalterable and universal
lesson which nature teaches us ? Is it not this ? That all
her processes are gradual, orderly, sequential, regular, and
harmonious, admitting of neither acceleration nor of retarda-
tion, excepting only in so far as we interfere with them, and
that they are equally removed from stagnation and precipi-
tation. For thousands of years the length of the day and
night in a given latitude, at a given period of the year, has
not varied a single second. For millions of years there has
been and could be no infraction of the law that two atoms
of oxygen combine with one atom of carbon to form a mole-
cule of carbonic acid, and that that molecule cannot possibly
be combined in any other way. To do so would require the
performance of a miracle, and to perform a miracle would
involve a supernatural act, and to imagine anything super-
natural is to depose the Almighty from His supremacy, by
supposing some being above Him, and capable of overriding:
and overruling His laws, which being, like Himself, abso-
lutely perfect, are therefox'e absolutely immutable. We see,,
then, in nature, that all moves on with sublime stedfastuess
and steadiness, calm, equable, progressive and unresting, free
from the tumult and the stir which agitate us, and exempt
also from the fret and fever of our discordant and misdirected
lives ; while it is beginning to be dimly discerned that those
convulsions of the physical world which seem to be incon-
sistent with this order and regularity, are due to unnatural
causes?to the destruction by human agency of the exquisite
balance of nature. For the scientific definition of a storm is
this :?? It is the movement of the air caused by its tendency
to re-establish an eqtiilibrium which has in some manner been
disturbed.? Aiow, at every point of the earth?s surface to
which the so-called civilized races have penetrated, that equi-
librium has been not merely disturbed but destroyed by us.
By no modern student of nature has this subject been inves-
tigated more thoughtfully and more successfully than by
Professor Marsh, of the United States, who writes:?
? Wherever man plants his foot the harmonies of nature are
turned to discords. The proportions and accommodations
which insured the stability of existing arrangements are over-
thrown. Indigenous vegetable and animal species are extir-
pated by others of foreign origin ; spontaneous production


is forbidden or restricted, and the face of the earth is lauf
bare or covered with a new and reluctant growth of vegetable
forms, and with alien tribes of animal life. . . . Man
pursues his victims with reckless destructiveness ; and while
the sacrifice of life by the lower animals is limited by the
cravings of appetite, he unsparingly persecutes, even to ex-
tirpation, thousands of organic forms which he cannot con-
sume.? Let me illustrate this connection of natural convulsions
with human agency by the mention of a familiar fact. More
than one-half of the old Roman empire is now either a de-
sert, or is greatly reduced in productiveness and population.
Vast areas that once waved with cornfields, and were adorned
with forests, orchards, and gardens, are now an arid wilder-
ness, with no evaporation, and with only a fitful and violent
rainfall. Upon huge tracts of blinding sand the glare of the
summer sunshine beats with fiercest power. The lower
strata of the atmosphere, intensely rarefied, rapidly ascend,
and there is a violent inrush of colder air from cooler lati-
tudes. It depends upon the velocity of this inrush whether,
in the districts over which it passes, there is a gale, a tempest,
or a hurricane. These violent disturbances of the atmosphere,
it is well known, have been increasing in frequency and in
their calamitous results during the last century, because the
area of devastation is being annually expanded by the spread
of population in North America, in South Africa, and in
Australia, where the overthrow of the balance of nature by
the destruction of forests is being pursued with frightful
vehemence and effect. Now, what lies at the root of"these
evils ? _ It is not merely selfishness, but it is a selfishness
which is greatly aggravated by ignorance. And for this, our
systems of education, which are an inheritance from the
middle ages, are mainly responsible. There never was a time
when we knew so much?that is not worth the knowing ; or
knew so little?of what we ought to know, as the present.
? Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and we linger on the
shore,
And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.?*
Now, what are the first questions which each of us asks him-
self when his mind begins to unfold and consciousness
awakens in him ? Are they not these ? ? What am I ?
? Where am I ? Why am I?? Do our systems of educa-
tion make any adequate provision for supplying us?l will
not say with a satisfactory response, but?with the means of
enabling us to obtain an intelligent reply to each of these
interrogations ? I think not. Up to a certain point, and in
eo far as they qualify us to read, write, and cypher, their


Utility is not to be questioned. But when a boy has acquired
these necessary rudiments and implements, what follows ?
The rest are suffered to rust unused. Not unfrequently they
are altogether atrophied. The memory should be the register
of persona! experiences, recorded for our information, guid-
ance and warning ; whereas it is a lumber room, crammed
full of facts and dates, which are of no value to ourselves or
to others. It is my serious and deliberate conviction that
our methods of instruction, especially as regards what is
called the higher education, are so many ingenious devices
for crippling, distorting, and destroying the human mind,
and that they are fatal to all originality, while it may be
safely asserted that an erudite man?a ? prodigy of learn-
ing? let us say?is one of the most useless creatures on
the face of God?s earth. Engage in conversation with him,
and then enter into familiar chat with an intelligent gardener,
and the chances are that you will learn something worth
knowing from the latter, because he thinks his own thoughts,
has nature for his schoolmaster, and is addicted by the'very
necessity of his calling to daily and hourly observation and
reflection. Whereas the eyes of the learned man are set in
the back of his head, and he lives amidst the shadows and
the mould, and the mildew of the past. He could tell you
all about the five great monarchies, the siege of Troy, the
Achaian League, the Catiline conspiracy, and the Parthian
revolt. But ? what?s Hecuba to us, or we to Hecuba ?? I
know what Lord Bolingbroke said about history being
? philosophy teaching by example,? but this, which is theoï¿½
retically true, is practically false, for no nation was ever
taught by the example of another. Communities are like
individuals. Each must purchase its own experience, and it
generally does so?as we are doing?at a particularly high
price. Therefore, ?let the dead past bury its dead.? Heaven
knows, the records of the human race are so full of blood-
shed and misery,
?Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and
fiery sands,
Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and
praying hands
our annals are all so
? Centred in a doleful song,
Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,?
that I could heartily wish they were obliterated from our
literature, and that we might be no longer confronted by
these ghastly chronicles of spoliation, butchery, brute vio-
lence, and devilish malignity.


I have said that the first thing a boy should be taught
is, what he is ! And Ido not know any branch of study
?which is more delightful, or fuller of perennial interest, than
that of the anatomy and physiology of the human frame ;
certainly none which is more indispensable to every one of
us. Each of us inhabits a ? temple not made with hands,?
which is so wonderful in its structure that the most imposing
monuments of human architecture are mean, clumsy, and
unsightly in comparison with it. But what do the generality
of us know about this elaborate palace, with its five gate-
ways, its two rivers, its exquisite windows, its symmetrical
dome, its telegraphic system, its never-flagging furnace, its
double-action force-pump, its laboratory, its complicated and
delicate mechanism, and that invisible something which sits
in the upper chamber and communicates with the outer
world by the intermediation of the senses ? Upon the healthy
and harmonious working of this wondrous fabric depends
our happiness, as also our attainment of the natural term of
our lives. And remember that all disease is unnatural.
Health is the normal condition of humanity, and disease is
simply the product and the penalty of disobedience to the
laws of nature ?that is to say, the laws of God. Sir John
Lubbock has pointed out in his ? Origin of Civilization,? that
savages are rarely ill. It is only when they are brought
into contact with us, who call ourselves civilized, that they
wither away before our epidemics and are blighted and
blasted by our spirituous liquors. Much of the illness that
exists is the result of sheer ignorance. AVe are strangers to
the human edifices we inhabit ; and being unconscious of the
exquisite delicacy of their details, we derange and destroy
them with criminal recklessness. But I think if every boy
and girl were made acquainted with the general structure of
the human frame, with the nature and operation of the five
senses, and with the processes of respiration, nutrition, cir-
culation, and locomotion, you would find such pupils coming
back, like Oliver Twist, for more. Children are greatly in-
terested in phenomena, and care very little for words, and
names, and dates. But words, and names, and dates, unfor-
tunately, make up the greater part of the sum of our educa-
tion ; and I entirely fail to see their value. AA r hy do I want
to burden my memory with such rubbish as the particulars
of the Battle of Marathon, of the League of Cambray, of the
number of rooms in the Vatican, of the year of the Norman
Conquest, or of the nature of the Pragmatic Sanction ; when
I can turn them up at a minute?s notice in a Dictionary of
Dates ? But it is very material to my happiness and com-


fort, and to the welfare of those who are dependent upon me,
that I should be well acquainted with the mortal tenement
I inhabit, so as to keep it in perfect repair until my lease ex-
pires, and the old and worn-out building is pulled down.
And children, I repeat, would receive with avidity any in-
formation respecting their own bodies. Suppose you see a
boy lifting an apple to his mouth, and you explain to him in
simple language all the actions involved, would he not listen
to the narrative as readily as to a fairy tale ? You say to
him, either through the eye, or the sense of taste, stimu-
lated by the recollection of the pleasure received from eating
previous fruit of the same kind, a message was sent to the
brain along the afferent nerves that you wished to renew the
pleasure by eating that apple. The mind reads off that
message in an instant of time, and transmits to the hand,
through the efferent nerves, a message to grasp aud convey
the fruit to the mouth. In so doing, the cerebellum or little
brain acts as a battery, and sends a current of electricity
along the telegraphic wires ; and in obedience to this com-
mand some thousands of delicate fibres, uniting in an
elastic rope called a muscle, contract or shorten themselves,
and by this means bring the arm up to the head. In so
doing 30 bones are called into active exercise under con-
straint of the tightened muscular cordage, involving the
rapid and easy play of such mechanical principles as the
ball and socket, the hinge-joint, the block and pulley, and
so forth. But the two sets of wires or nerves, the battery
or cerebellum, and the ropes or muscles, as well as the
machinery or bones which co-operated in producing this
simple motion of your arm, lost something of their sub-
stance in the complex process. There was what physiolo-
gists call a waste of tissue, and this had immediately to be
compensated for. All motion is the result of force, or
mind ; and involves the breaking down, decomposition, and
removal of the material agencies through which it is
accomplished. Now, an ordinary machine of steel and
iron would wear itself out in time by friction and oxidisa-
tion ; but the human structure possesses the inherent
porver of reconstituting itself during the term of its natural
existence. It has been aptly compared to a stupendous
factory, in which vegetable and animal food is being trans-
formed by solvent fluids into the raw material of the blood ;
and this, when aerated or vitalised by the lungs, replaces,
by living cells, the dead cells which have fulfilled their
office and have ceased to be. And thus you will see the
paramount importance of a regular and adequate supply of


nutritious food for body-building purposes, as also the in-
dispensable necessity of breathing none but pure air, by
day and night, so that the blood?? which is the life??may
not be impoverished or contaminated.
Take the eye and ear again. Do not you think that
if the structure and functions of each of these marvel-
lous avenues to the mind were explained to a boy, that it
would interest him far more, and be of infinitely greater
service to him, than any amount of information he may
acquire about the campaigns of Cï¿½sar or Napoleon ?
Show him that he possesses in the organs of vision a self-
acting, self-adjusting photographic apparatus, compared
with which the best instrument in Messrs. Batchelder?s
establishment is coarse, clumsy, and inconvenient ; ex-
plain to him the formation of the ear, with its outer vesti-
bule, its drum, its inner chamber, with its circular and oval
windows, its hammer, and anvil, and stirrup, its two wind-
ing staircases, and its 3000 pianoforte keys and strings, and
you will conduct him into a realm of wonders compared with
which the cities we read of in the Arabian Nights are com-
monplace and uninteresting. Then show him that sound and
sight are one, that the impressions produced by each are
occasioned by vibrations?are merely modes of motion, in
f ac t?and that the seven notes of music correspond with the
seven colours which combine to form a ray of white light ;
and that boy, I venture to think, will begin to look at all
objects, and to listen to all sounds in a totally different man-
ner, while everything he sees and hears will be invested
with a new interest, and possibly with an unexpected charm.
Not only so, but he will understand the preciousness of the
ox-gans and faculties of seeing and hearing, and will take
greater care of them in consequence. The second thing our
children should be taught is ? Where they are,? so that they
may be induced to prize this beautiful earth, to perceive its
never-failing and inexhaustible majesty and loveliness, may
use without abusing it, may cultivate it in obedience to and
harmony with the divine order of nature, and may dress it
and keep it in conformity with the beneficent purpose and
commands of its Creator. Ido not know of any direction in
which theology has been more mischievous to the Western
nations than in diverting them from the observation and
study of natural phenomena. And this has been the more
culpable because such a systematic discouragement of natural
science is diametrically opposed to the written word of Gob.
In a book, the plenary inspiration of which I acknowledge
without qualification or reservation, I find it thus written :


?? The invisible things of Clou from the creation of thq
? world?even His eternal power and Godhead?are clearly
? seen, being understood by the things that are made, so that
?men are without excuse.? Thus, then, we can only under-
stand the ideas of God by the observation of the ? things
? that are made??that is to say, by the visible presentment
of those ideas in the forms of which we can take cognisance
by our senses. Mature must be our instructress. And the
same impressive truth is repeated in the Book of Job:
? Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee ; and the
? fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee ; or speak to the
? earth, and it shall teach thee ; and the fishes of the sea
? shall declare unto thee.? Yet, until quite recently, the
natural sciences had no place whatever in our systems of
education ; and it was not until about the beginning of the
present century that men obtained a glimmering of the idea
of evolution, so explicitly enunciated in the 139 th Psalm ; ox-
arrived at a faint perception of the fact that the mental con-
stitution of the lower animals is identical in its natux-e with
our own, although it is emphatically declared in the first
chapter of Genesis that there is ? a living soul ? in ? every
? beast of the earth, and in every fowl of the air, and in
? evex-ything that creepeth upon the earth;? while it is
also proclaimed in the plainest of language, by the same
Holy Scriptures, that ?we have all one breath, so that aman
?hath no pre-eminence above a beast.? What the human,
race has lost during the last eighteen centuries by shutting
its eyes to ? the things that are made,? and by placing the
study of Nature under a ban, it is impossible to compute
And if you are ouidous to know the amount of bloodshed,
misery, and suffering which have X'esulted from the proscrip-
tion of science by the various churches, you will find plenty
of information on the subject in the works of Dr. Dx-aper,
Professor White (of the Cornell University), Sir David
.Brewster, and Mr. Lecky. In putting forward a plea for the
education of the young in the natural sciences, so as to enable
them to understand where they are, and what are the causes,
operations, and consequences of the most familiar phenomena
of every-day life, I am pleading for the means of their hap-
piness, as well as for the cultivation of their minds. Believe
me when I say it, as the result of my own experience, in the
study of a great many branches of knowledge during the
course of a busy life, that there is none so delightful and
fascinating, none so ever fresh and never tiring, none which
make us feel so truly that there is nothing smaller than our-
selves and nothing greater than God, as the study of the


natural sciences, and especially of natural history, more par-
ticularly if we look at all the forms of life?mineral, vege-
table, and animal, as mind manifesting itself in various stages
of growth. I have read, in my time, some exceedingly silly
books, written by some exceedingly learned men to prove
that certain things which our Lord assured us were ? done
?in parables? were actual miracles, or contraventions of
natural law ; but if you want a miracle in the true sense of
the word ?that is to say, something calculated to excite
wonder and admiration, just look at the germination and
growth of a seed. That is the most amazing fact with which
I am acquainted, and the more I reflect upon it the greater
is the awe I feel in its presence. Let us say that you visit
Egypt, and obtain from the hands of a mummy embalmed
3000 years ago a few grains of wheat. To look at it you
might suppose it to be dead. But you plant a single corn
under favourable conditions, and, after a short time, the life
-?dormant for 30 centuries?begins to stir within it. Its
vital principle ?its mind?commences working in the dark-
ness with a marvellous intelligence. It sends down a number
of delicate fibres into the earth. These are its stomach.
They absorb from the soil, digest, and assimilate the food it
requires. It sends up a delicate shoot into the light and air.
This becomes its organ of respiration, or lungs, as also of
circulation for the sap or fluid, which corresponds with our
blood. Why do these rootlets plunge into the dark mould,
while the green blade aspires towards the light, breaks its
way through the hardest crust, and rejoices in the sunshine ?
You will say that it obeys a law. But have you ever re-
flected upon the very obvious and simple truth that obedience
is a mental operation, and that wherever such obedience is
tendered, whether by gases in their combinations according
to certain definite proportions, or by a crystal in repairing
its fractured edges, by a plant, by a bird, beast, or man, the
king of the beasts, there must be mind. Without it, obe-
dience to law would be impossible. But pursue this pheno-
menon of plant-growth through all its stages. Watch the
evolution of the stalk, the leaves, the flower, and the per-
fected grain or seed, and try to imagine yourself looking at
these processes for the first time, and you will feel that you
Stand before the embodiment of a series of miracles, com-
pared with which every achievement of human ? genius,? as
it is called, sinks into utter insignificance. Then reflect
upon this further miracle. You sow the seeds of six different
plants in the same plot of ground, the constituents of the
soil being identical throughout. Not only does each plant,.


in its growth and maturity, differ from all the rest in form
and colour, in the shape of the leaf, and in the aspect of the
flower, but the first will elaborate from sun and soil a certain
quantity of sugar, the second gum, the third oil, the fourth
starch, the fifth resin, and the sixth opium. And the more
you examine the structure and functions of these plants with
the microscope or otherwise, the more you will find to
wonder at and admire.
Then, again, reflect upon the nature and phenomena of
sight and smell as associated with the flower. You take
a fuchsia, for example, some of the petals of which are purple,
while others are crimson, and others are white. Are these
exquisite colours which give so much pleasure to the eye,
both separately and in their harmonious combination, so
many properties residing in the flower ? On the contrary,
they are the reflections of different rays of light ; and the
impression produced upon the eye is the result of vibrations
of that elastic ether which pervades all space. In other
words, colour is light dissected, and light is merely a mode
of motion, just as sound is a mode of motion. Each wave of
light has a definite number of undulations, as also a definite
velocity of speed. Thus the waves, which by their pulsation
on the retina of the eye, cause us to receive the impression
of redness, are in round numbers 40,000 in an inch ; and
their velocity is so great that they accomplish 477 million
millions of undulations in a second ; while the purple rays
number 57,490 undulations in an inch, and 700 million mil-
lions of undulations in a second. The light is the life and
the glory of the flower, which aspires towards it, feeds upon
it, and rejoices in it. If you bend down the leafy shoot of
a plant so as not to hurt it, and reverse the usual position of
the faces of the leaves, you will soon find the latter twisting
upon their petioles, and turning their upper surfaces to the
light. Carry a plant into a dark room and leave it there,
and it will gradually languish and die. For all organic ac-
tivity is derived mediately or immediately from the sun ; and
life is most exuberant in those regions of the earth where
the power of that luminary is the greatest. There also is
vegetation the richest, the flavour of fruits the most luscious,
and the colouring of birds, insects, fishes, and flowers the
most gorgeous and resplendent ; while we know that light
everywhere quickens vital movements in animals, and es-
pecially the act of nutrition ; and, therefore, our principal
meal should always be eaten in the middle of the day, when
the sun is at his meridian. Let us next turn for a moment
to the odour of a flower ?to that of the violet, for example,


This is, like light, and heat, and sound, a mode of motion,
and nothing more. There is an octave of musical vibrations,
an octave of light or colour, and an octave of odours. There
are tones and semitones of fragrance. As one of the most
brilliant of French scientists (Papillon, quoting Piesse) has
observed :?Some perfumes accord like the notes of an in-
? strument. Thus almond, vanilla, heliotrope, and clematis.
harmonise perfectly, each of them producing the same im-
pression in a different degree. On the other hand, we
? have citron, lemon, orange-peel, and verbena, forming a
? similarly associated octave of odours, in a higher key. The
ï¿½ analogy is completed by those odours which we call half-
? scents, such as the rose, with rose geranium for its semi-
? tone.? And the sense of smell is produced by a motion
Communicated intermediately to the nerve fibres of the nose
from without ; while the organ by which odours are per-
ceived or received and discriminated, is as full of wonders as
each of the other avenues to the brain. ? The olfactory lobe
? rests close upon that part of the floor of the cranium which
?is called the cribriform plate. This plate (lying between
? the sockets of the eyes), is perforated like a sieve, and it
? is through these perforations that the filaments from the
? olfactory lobe are sent down in immensely numerous
t! threads into each division of the nose,? where they termi-
nate in a closely packed mass of olfactory cells. These re-
ceive the odorous impressions, while the nerve fibres announce
to the brain the fact of an irritation having taken place, as
also the nature of it. I have touched upon these things
incidentally and by way of illustration, just to show what
innumerable and illimitable fields of knowledge are opened
up all around us, what a living miracle every one of us is,
and how much there is to instruct, to interest, and to charm
us. in the intelligent study of our own bodies, and of the
forms and forces of nature with which we are incessant!)
brought into contact. The more we investigate the doings
of the race to which we belong, as disclosed to us in history
and biography, the more we find to shook, repel, disgust, and
wound us. The annals of nations are so many magnified
editions of the Newgate Calendar. The greatest scoundrels
are the greatest heroes. The bloodiest deeds are those
which live longest in story, and are celebrated with the
greatest enthusiasm in song. I need scarcely remind you
that the oldest epic in the world describes and commemorates
a 10 years? siege and a protracted war ; and that the most
famous names in history are those of wholesale slaughter-
men?eminent villains who butchered men instead of cattle.


Most of us, in our schoolboy days, were made to learn the
history of Rome ?a nice record truly ! There were the two
brothers who founded the city, one of whom murdered the
other, while the survivor fell a victim to the jealousy
of the Senate. There was also the rape of the Sabines ; the
murder of Tullus Hostilius, and the destruction of his family
and palace by fire : the assassination of the first Tarquin ;
the murder of Servius Tullius, who was trampled to death
by order of his daughter ; the reign of Tarquin the Proud,
who got rid of his wife to marry her sister, and killed his
father-in-law ; the rape of Lucretia by Sextus, son of Tar-
quin ; and so on, and so on, to the end of the chapter. Edi-
fying information this ! But then all history is alike, and the
wretched creatures who are its factors are themselves, as
Byron says?
? The fools to those they fool ;
Envied, yet how unenviable ! what stings
Are theirs ! One breast laid open were a school
Which would unteach mankind the lust to shine or rule.?
But turn from this black and bloody calendar of wrong and
rapine, wickedness and woe, to the study of natural science,
and it is like emerging from shambles, slippery with gore,
ghastly with spectacles of ferocity and suffering, and foul
with the reek of corruption, to ?the balm, the bliss, the
? beauty and the bloom? of a virgin forest, where the sun-
light is sifted through the woof of aromatic leaves and fra-
grant blossoms, where the air is resonant with the melody of
birds, and where everything the eye beholds is eloquent of
God, the source of all good, the fountain of all wisdom, and
the author of all blessings. Nature speaks everywhere the
same language, which is the inspiration of the true artist,
and the theme of the true poet. And of the many amazing
thoughts which present themselves to our minds when we
reflect upon her loveliness, there is none more startling than
this?that so many of us should be, or should profess to be,
hankering after another world, when we are so lamentably
ignorant of that in which we are placed. We talk of a
heaven which the theologian posits in some indefinable and
undiscoverable region of space, but which the Holy Scrip-
tures assure us must be founded within us, and established
here on earth ; but do we ever think of trying to make a
little heaven around us ? Do we ever, in the indulgence of
that intense and all-absorbing selfishness which is the banc
of society in all civilized countries, ponder upon the pro-
found and impressive meaning of the inspired words, ? If a,
?man love not his brother whom he hath seen, how cat*


*< he love God whom he hath not seen ?? Do we ever con-
sider either the sacredness of the earth or the possibilities
which lie within it? It is our native country and our
home. We are ? not set here to live as aliens,? passing in
disguise through an enemy?s camp, where no allegiance is
due ; hut we are bound to recognise our kinship to the
whole of nature and to act accordingly. As an eloquent
tvriter once observed, ? If no heavenly voices wander around
?us in the present, the future will be but the dumb change
?of the shadow on the dial.? The more I see of the trans-
cendent beauty of the world, in so far as it still bears the
divine impress of the Mind from which it emanated, and the
more I reflect upon the wonders which present themselves
for our instruction and delight in the ? things that are
? made,? the greater becomes my regret that the natural
Sciences should be altogether excluded from, or should oc-
cupy so inferior and unworthy a position in, our ordinary
systems of education. And let me beg of you to remember
this?the students of nature never persecute, proscribe, im-
prison, torture, or destroy each other. No astronomer ever
condemned another astronomer to the stake. No botanist
ever butchered another botanist, because they disagreed
about the classification of a flower. No geologist ever con-
fined another geologist in the dungeons of the Inquisition,
because they entertained differences of opinion with respect
to the duration of the last glacial period. Nor have there
been any scientific wars to soak the soil of Europe with the
blood of controversialists fighting about a foolish symbol or
concerning the genesis of life. On the other hand,_ if you
would know how the study of the natural sciences inclines
the human mind towards natural piety, just read that irre-
pressible burst of eloquence which broke from the lips of
Linnï¿½us when he had completed his admirable work on the
organisation of plants, and with which I may fitly conclude
the present lecture : ?? The eternal, vast, omniscient and om-
nipotent God has passed before me. I have not seen Him
face to face, but a dim reflection of Him seizing on my soul,
has plunged it in a stupor of admiration. I have followed
here and there the traces of Him amidst the works of creation,
and in all these, even in the minutest and most imperceptible,
what power, what wisdom, what indefinable perfection ! I
have observed how all animal life is superimposed upon and
interlinked with the vegetable kingdom, and how vegetation
is associated with the minerals deposited in the entrails of the
globe, while the globe itself gravitates in an invariable order
around the sun, to which it owes its life. Then I have be-


held the sun and all the other stars ?the vast hosts of heaven,
immense, incalculable in their infinitude, moving in space and
suspended in the void by an incomprehensible First Motor,
the Being of beings, the Cause of causes, the Guide and Con-
servator of the universe, the Master and Workman of the
stupendous fabric of the world. Everything that He has
created bears witness to His wisdom and His divine power ;
while all things are at the same time the treasure-house and
the element of our felicity. Their usefulness attests the
bounty of Him who made them ; their loveliness exhibits the
magnificent beauty of His mind ; while their harmony, their
constancy, their exquisitely just proportions and their inex-
haustible fecundity, proclaim the power of the omnipotent
God. Is it not He upon Whom you bestow the name of
Providence ? That is indeed the attribute, since it is only
by His counsel that we can explain the existence of the world.
It is therefore just to believe that He is a God, immense,
eternal, whom no being has engendered, whom nothing has
created, without whom nothing can exist, and who has made
and ordained this universal work. He eludes our vision,
while He fills our eyes with light. He is apprehensible only
by thought ; for it is in that profound sanctuary that He
veils His majesty from human ken.? Such is the natural re-
ligion?such the glow, the rapture, the adoration, and the
gratitude which are capable of being inspired by a loving and
reverential study of the natural sciences, which ought to form
one, at least, of the bases of all true education, in the highest
and best sense of the word. And if I have refrained from
touching upon the third of the questions with which I set
out, namely, ? Why am I ?? it is because it would involve the
discussion of a subject which would be provocative of angry
controversy, for which this is neither the time nor place.
