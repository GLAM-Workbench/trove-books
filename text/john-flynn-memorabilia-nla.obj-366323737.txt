THE. NURSING HOML OF TO-DAY.
This fine Nursing Home is being erec'ed by the A.I.M. at Alice Springs, the “middle of the middle of Australia.” It is our sixth centre
of healing, and is 320 miles away from the nearest hospital—our own also, at Oodnadatta. ft is for similar homes that we require a
strong Building Loan Fund. Even now, six new districts are earnestly enquiring.


ALICE SPRINGS, CENTRAL AUSTRALIA
One other little edifice has been erected since this photo was taken eight years ago. Imagine the moral effect of adding our
modern Nursing Home to this tiny hamlet. It will cheer on those who are strong, as well as heal those who are sick.


THE. DOCTOR OF TO-MORROW
(As seen by eyes of “Harper's Magazine.”)
We are grateful to Harper’s Magazine for the vision, which so happily combines ancient tradition with modern enterprise,
thus making a significant message for Australia. We must strenuously spread interest in this reasonable boon for our pioneers, so
that it will he granted “ to-morrow ’bfiwiot next century !
To return to to-day ; the A.I.M, languishes for lack of sufficient capital in the Building Loan Fund. Do you not realize
what enormous amount of good may be effected by worthy buildings that speak of our sympathy with the pioneers ? Already
the bush people are becoming brighter because we have brought them, new hope. If we do more, we will compel others to get busy,
and “ greater things ” will follow. Meantime folk out there.are learning to believe in unseen love. That lead to Faith.
Contributions to the Building Loan Fund will be gratefully received at any Presbyterian Church Office, or by the General
Treasurer, Mr. William Wood, Box 100 G.P.0., Sydney.
