The illustration conveys at a glance the construction of the invention, and, as will at
once be seen, the “ dripped ” sample is automatically and handily obtained. By its use no
alterations or expense in fittings are required; while as a further advantage, it can be
applied where milk is either measured or weighed.
The bracket is made adjustable so as to fit the rim of any tank up to if in. in thickness,
and, furthermore, in cases where the milk tank is not standing level, the angle of the bracket
can be altered so as to maintain the sampler in its proper level position.
It cannot be too often or too forcibly urged that, for success in milk testing and paying
by results, it is essential that a fair sample be always obtained; and as it is universally
admitted in America (the home of the factory system) and elsewhere that the “ drip ”
sample is absolutely accurate, it is necessary that, wherever milk testing is carried out, the
“ drip ” system should be adopted.

THE LANCE-BABCOCK
PATENT MILK TESTER.
Dr. BABCOCK’S method remains intact, but this machine is designed to meet
the long-felt want of an improvement in the mechanism employed.
The wheel is mounted on a dome-shaped steel cover, and creates the required
speed by friction on a rubber pinion on the top of the spindle, which is adjustable
to allow for the wearing of the rubber.
The weight of the wheel on the rubber pinion ensures a perfect grip, and this
is increased by the fact that the friction is from the inside bevel of the wheel, and
this at the same time causes less wear and tear to the rubber.
The rubber rings can be renewed without taking the machine to pieces.
The top centre is attached to the lid under the wheel, and, being pointed, finds
its way into the hole in the top of the spindle as the lid is shut down. The centre
is adjustable.
The lid is beaded round the edge, so as to perfectly fit over the side, and this
ensures rigidity when the wheel is being turned.
When the lid is open the wheel rests on a stop at the back of the hinge, and
thus prevents the lid falling back.
The spindle and flask carrier can be removed at will when the lid is open, and
thus several carriers could be employed with one machine if required.
The machine does not require bolting down, as the horizontal action of the
wheel keeps it steady.
The machine can thus be readily moved about, and in this respect will offer a
special advantage to travelling milk testers.
For farmers’ use this design is specially suitable.
The machines can be made with a hot water jacket, which will keep the fat in
a liquid condition, which is a special advantage in the larger sizes.

PREFACE.
THE system of payment for milk by results, that I have formulated
to suit our local requirements, and which has been adopted here
with success, has attracted a good deal of attention from dairymen of
Victoria and New South Wales, and this pamphlet has been written in
response to the repeatedly expressed wishes of many of my correspondents
and visitors. I have striven not only to clearly describe the system,
but to substantiate and verify all the points in connection with it;
and though the pamphlet contains much that is neither new nor original,
I trust it will serve a good purpose in advancing this particular branch
of the dairying industry in this country. The work was originally begun
under instructions from the directors of the Euroa Company, who were
amongst the first to recognise the necessity of some such system; and I take
this opportunity of thanking them, as well as the manager (Mr. W.
Ric-Hansen), for their persistent encouragement and help. In this respect
I am also much indebted to Mr. H. W. Potts, Chemist, of this town.

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.
THE very hearty reception accorded to the first edition of this pamphlet
_ has caused its speedy exhaustion, and necessitated a second edition.
It is in the very nature of subjects of this kind that they should be always
growing and undergoing modification, and whilst the general system and
table I have formulated remain unaltered, there is a very large portion of
this edition that is new, and treats much more exhaustively of several phases
of the question ; hence its considerable enlargement. It now embodies
up-to-date information with regard to sampling and testing, and also as
to the use of the new chemical, formalin, for the preservation of composite
samples.

PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.
THE fact that another edition of this pamphlet has become necessary is
_ gratifying evidence of the interest that is being taken in this branch
of dairying, and shows that there is no longer any doubt as to the necessity
of paying for milk according to its quality. lam glad of the opportunity
of again revising and bringing the information up to date, and of adding a
chapter on the subject of cream testing, which is now engaging the attention
of those in the van of the industry.

milk testing
PHYPIEHT FOR JRILK BY RESULTS
fHE advisability of paying for milk according to its butter
fat value has, of late, become so fully recognised by
dairymen generally, that, by way of prefacing this
pamphlet it is only necessary to briefly refer to the
advantages that must inevitably accrue from the introduction of
such a system.
Hitherto, milk has been about the only important commodity
used in civilised life, that has not been purchased according to
its quality, and this fact has not only fostered dishonesty, but
has, under the factory system more especially, prevented any
improvement in the dairy herds of the colonies. Whilst private
dairying was in vogue, no doubt, the butter-producing value of
a cow was to some extent studied, even though the means of
ascertaining it were not very ready; but when the factory
system was introduced, the door was instantly opened to
dishonesty by means of adulteration, and the incentive to keep
good butter-producers was entirely swept away. Even though
a man might shrink from dishonesty, he could not be expected
to do otherwise than aim at producing a large quantity of milk,


when the purchasers took no account of quality, and the result
of this would, as far as the factory was concerned, have
amounted to just the same thing as adulteration. Thus the
factory system, worked upon its original lines, would probably
have done absolute injury to the dairying industry generally, and
the factories and creameries would have brought about their
own destruction; for it goes without saying that, since the
object of dairying is to produce butter, anything that tends to
reduce that production per acre will impoverish the country. I
am glad to know that there are now comparatively few factories in
Australia where payment by results has not been adopted, and I
think it will be admitted that, for this highly desirable state of
affairs, much of the credit is due, not only to the teachings
and results of experiments given in the first edition of this
pamphlet, but also to the persistent advocacy of the system in
the columns of that increasingly popular, and widely circulating,
journal, the Australian Farm and Home. The principle is
now in the air, and simple and effective sampling and testing
appliances being obtainable, there is little doubt but that its
application will very speedily become universal. By it, the
injustices and anomalies of the old system will be done away
with, and the factory companies placed upon a purely commer-
cial basis as buyers of butter fat; and the case would in no way
be altered if cheese-making became more general, because the
same principle of increased production from richer milk is
applicable to that industry.
It may, of course, be argued, by those who have not yet
adopted the method, that the management can protect itself by
ascertaining from time to time the average value of the milk
received, and regulate the price accordingly, but this does not
dispose of the main contention—that the tendency would be
towards a decrease of production of butter per acre ; and, more-
over, this plan still leaves the honest and progressive dairyman
at the mercy of his dishonest and unprogressive neighbour, and
he will probably be dissatisfied and inclined to revert to the old
system of dairying, under which he would (in spite of the many


advantages the factory offers him) at least get the proportionate
benefit of his better bred cows and improved system of feeding,
etc. It is to the former type of dairyman that the industry has
to look for anything like established success, and it is therefore
his interest that must be studied by the directors. Previously,
however, though every dairyman undoubtedly received sub-
stantial advantage from the factory system, it was the supplier
of inferior milk who was the greatest gainer.
THE VARIATION IN THE QUALITY OF MILK.
Before entering upon a statement of the methods I propose
to adopt in order to pay according to value, it may perhaps be as
well, by way of further establishing its necessity, to illustrate
the extent to which milk varies in quality. Of the absolute
physical nature of milk, strange to say, we know comparatively
little, and the discussion of the subject is still being carried on
by scientists. Some years ago M. Ducleaux successfully
assailed the accepted theory—that the fat globules in milk were
surrounded by a nitrogenous envelope, which had to be broken
before fusion of the fat could take place, and the non-existence
of this envelope became generally admitted. Recently, however,
he has retracted his assertions, and now holds that the fat
globules are “enveloped by a membrane of an albuminoid
nature,” and he regards milk as a humour rather than an
emulsion. Independent research in other directions tends to
confirm this view, but all this leads us to see how little we really
know about this common commodity. Of the general constituent
parts, however, we have been made acquainted by means of
chemical analysis, and we know that it is only the butter fat
that varies to any considerable extent. The comparative
“constancy of composition” that milk exhibits in all other
respects is what enables the analyst to detect adulteration, which
the mere deficiency of fat, without disturbance of the other
proportions, would not indicate.

The extent of variation in the fat—with which alone we, as
butter makers, are concerned—will be abundantly evidenced by
the following tests of a herd of twenty-seven cows :
Per Cent.

The average results from this supply was 3*4
In several instances very probably the quantity of milk made
up for the poor quality, but it would be difficult to imagine a
quantity that could compensate for poor quality in No. 1.
From No. 1 cow I subsequently obtained milk, taken at the
beginning of the milking, which only contained - 8 per cent, of
fat. On the other hand, I have had average milk from cows
that tested 6 per cent., and strippings testing 7‘B per cent.
The weekly tests at the factory vary from 3 per cent, to
5 per cent., and, of course, it is the variation of these results that
most clearly indicates the necessity of some equitable adjustment
of values.
Average milk will test about 3-6 per cent, of fat, but as
showing what may be done by care and enterprise, Mr. H. P.
Collins, of Candelo, delivers at the N.S.W. Creamery Butter
Company’s Mogilla Factory, milk that tests 4-6 per cent. It is
almost needless to add that these are Jersey cows, but the herd is
a large one, and in full milk at the time of this quotation.
TESTING INSTEUMENTS.
Previous to the introduction of the Babcock tester, the
difficulty that stood in the way, not only of any system of
differential payment, but even of the detection of adulteration,
was the want of a reliable testing instrument, though many had
been offered to the public. Neither the much lauded Lacto-
meter nor the Cream Gauge, which were the best known
appliances, were of any real value; and for the sake of those


who are still using either of them, I will substantiate this state-
ment —sheltering myself behind the great authority, Dr.
Wanklyn. Of the Lactometer —which, of course, is a means of
ascertaining the specific gravity of milk—he says:—“ There
hardly ever was an instrument which has so utterly failed as the
Lactometer.- It confounds together milk which is exceptionally
rich, with milk which has been largely watered ; and many a
Poor French peasant, bringing the best and unadulterated
produce of his dairy into a French town, has been ruthlessly
stopped by the police, who have dipped their Lactometer into
the milk, and forthwith sent it down the gutter as if it had been
milk and water.”
The reason of this is, that water is lighter than milk, and
also that the fat is the lightest constituent of milk. If, there-
fore, water be added to average milk, its specific gravity will be
decreased, and this would also be the case if the milk were
exceptionally rich in fat.
Eeferring to the Cream Gauge, Dr. Wanklyn says: —
“ Normal milk yields about 10 per cent, of cream ; but that is
subject to great irregularity, and a milk may yield very much
less without having been tampered with, or it may yield the 10
per cent, and nevertheless have been tampered with.”
Moreover, the cream itself varies greatly in richness, almost
as much, indeed, as milk does. It is simply milk that is highly
charged with fat globules, and hence rises to the top, but the
proportion of fat which it contains is by no means persistent. Dr.
Wanklyn gives analyses of cream that show a variation of from 19
to 43 per cent, of fat; he says:—“ We are led to the conclusion
that cream is sometimes twice as rich in fat as it is at other
times, and, that being granted, what becomes of the creamo-
meter, regarded as an instrument of precision ?” Another
interesting point is that “ watered milk throws up its fat in the
form of cream more perfectly than unwatered milk.”
The only two methods, therefore, by which a reliable
indication of the butter fat could be obtained, were actual
churning and chemical analysis. The first of these, as a
systematic method, was prohibitive on account of the trouble
involved; and the second on account of the cost.


THE BABCOCK TESTER.
To generalise from a local reminiscence, the situation—with
a constantly decreasing yield, and much dissatisfaction amongst
the better dairymen—was one of extreme perplexity, until the
Babcock Tester was introduced. Its introduction marked a new
era in the history of Australian dairying, and it is destined to
play a still more important part in the future. An American
writer pithily remarks that, “ The Babcock test clears away what
you may call the personal equation, it clears the moral hazard
out of this business!” And again, with that inimitable Ameri-
can humour, “ The Babcock test beats the Bible in making a man
honest. I have been quoting scripture to my people for years
and could not improve them. I put in a Babcock test and every-
thing came right to time !” But, when properly applied to the
payments, it does far more than this ; it supplies the great and
only incentive to attend to the improvement of breed, and to
careful selection; to the study of fodder, and to intelligent
handling—to everything, in fact, that will tend to increase pro-
duction from a given area, and thus lay the foundation of a
lasting and prosperous industry.
It seems almost unnecessary to say anything by way of
establishing the accuracy of this well-known machine as an
indicator of the percentage of butter fat contained in milk, and
yet this pamphlet would hardly be complete unless I did so. In
matters of this kind, practical experience over a lengthened
period is the most valuable, and after years of constant use, I
have no hesitation in saying that the Babcock is an absolutely
reliable tester. When the machine is accurately worked, and
the business of the factory properly conducted with modem
appliances, the returns computed by the tester and paid for, will
always substantially agree with the output from the chum,
which of necessity must be the final arbiter in the matter.
At all the experimental stations in the United States
exhaustive experiments have been carried out, and at the
World’s Fair, Chicago, there were made the most elaborate
series of dairy tests ever attempted, and all have resulted in


establishing the absolute accuracy of the Babcock tester. All
the factory managers who have used it bear the same testimony,
and, therefore, it may be safely assumed that in it we now have
a reliable indicator of the butter value of milk.
THE MAIN QUESTION.
At this stage arises the main question that I have set myself
to answer : —By what system can this principle be satisfactorily
applied to the ordinary working of a butter factory ? Such a
system, I take it, must not involve undue trouble in its working,
and it must be one that will give complete satisfaction to
suppliers and management alike.
SAMPLING.
To secure this end, it may be said, at the outset, that daily
sampling of milk is an absolute necessity. Were it certain that
all the milk was at least honest, this, perhaps, Avould not be so
necessary from the manager’s point of view, for in that case the
average result of, say, two weekly tests of each supplier’s milk
might be fairly satisfactory. But, of course, he cannot be sure
of this, and in any case it would be obviously futile to arrange a
scheme which would not provide against dishonesty. Possibly
a small factory, having no outlying creameries, and with only a
small number of suppliers, might find daily sampling unneces-
sary, but in any large concern, with suppliers delivering at the
factory and the outside creameries, weekly samples would have
to be taken more or less by routine in order to get them all done
within the given time. Now, although it would be possible to
test a man’s milk several days running, all the chances would
be in favour of it not being tested again for some days after his
turn had come round, and here would be the opportunity for dis-
honesty ; and even supposing that it were detected, it would only
mean a reduction of the average for that pay period. It may be
argued that a penalty could be attached to such delinquencies,
but apart from the difficulty and unpleasantness of such a
method, it could only be applied in extreme cases—which have
always been readily dealt with—and not in the case of a more
judicious adulterator or “ skimmer,” who is really the greater
menace to the factory. B

On the other hand, to the honest supplier, who wants no
more than his due, it must be a source of great satisfaction to
know that his whole supply is sampled with unfailing regularity;
and the manager can point to this as evidence of the accuracy of
the results. Moreover, it is a well-known fact that milk from
the same cows will vary daily. Mr. Hoard, of Wisconsin )
speaks of a Jersey cow of his, whose milk one day would test
5 per cent., and the next day, without any ascertainable reason,
would test 4J per cent, and. then again go up to 5-2, and so on.
At the experimental station of Illinois, U.S.A., exhaustive
experiments were recently made with six cows during one period
of lactation, which indicated most remarkable variations. From
the mass of figures, I have extracted a few of the most interesting
items, and condensed them into the following table ;

Again, to illustrate the daily variations, I take a record of six
consecutive days in the sixth month of cow No. 5, which is a
sample of similar variations in the others
Date. Pounds of Milk. Per Cent, of Fat,

June 20 ... 132 . ... 1-9
June 21 ... 17‘7 ... ... 3’B
From the above tables it is perfectly evident that occasional
testing of a cow’s milk is a worse than useless guide to the value
of the cow ; and an argument from analogy would lead, us to
the conclusion that occasional samples from the whole herd’s
supply would also be unreliable. I therefore urge the necessity
of regular daily sampling at the factories and creameries; for


although, of course, there will he no such variation of a whole
daily supply as is evidenced by the examination of single cows,
I know from experience that there is slight variation in the
average milk from day to day. Dr. Babcock finds this to be up
to -3 per cent.
The state of our knowledge of this part of the subject does
not enable us to say what may be the causes of this variation;
but probably change of weather, change of pasturage, change of
servants, may all play important parts in slightly affecting the
quality of even a large daily supply. In the case of a very
small supply from a few cows, it would be readily explained by
the best milker being “off,” or otherwise, for (referring to the
foregoing table) a cow giving 17-2 lb. of milk testing 5-1 to-day,
and 13’2 lb. testing 1-9 to-morrow, would have a decided effect
upon a small quantity.
But, admitting the necessity of daily sampling, it would be
impracticable for a factory having a large number of suppliers*
and most of them delivering at outside creameries, to make
daily tests of them. To meet this difficulty, I advocate and
adopt the “ composite sample ” system, t.e., daily samples put
into a bottle, and the contents of the bottle tested at the end of
each week. The absolute accuracy of this method, as compared
with daily testing, has been completely established by my own
experiments, as well as those of many others, both here and in
America.
THE DRIP SYSTEM.
The sample is obtained on what is known as the “drip”
system, and by means of a combined milk strainer and sampler
of my own invention, the method of which will be at once made
clear by the accompanying illustration. It is a compact con-
trivance, that hangs on to the milk tank. The milk is thrown
into the strainer, from which it rushes through the curved pipe
into the milk tank, and, in doing so, passes over a small hole,
through which a fair sample drips into the receptacle beneath.
When the supplier’s quantity has thus run through, a small
portion (about 17 c.c.) of the sample is poured into the bottle
which bears that supplier’s name. The cup is then replaced


to catch a sample from the next man’s milk. This is the
quickest and most reliable method that I know of (and I have
tried several others), and the trouble involved in the practical
manipulation of it, is scarcely worth mentioning. In cases
where milk is weighed, this system can, of course, be just as
easily applied by hanging the contrivance on the weigh tank.
It is most essential that the sample should be taken as the milk

is poured in from the cans, for it can never be properly sampled
after it has stood in the weigh tank for however short a time.
This applies especially to a mixture of night’s and morning’s
milk, and the doubts that have been expressed as to whether the
cream from night’s milk, or milk that has been kept over a day
or more, would be evenly distributed, have often been well
founded, when considered with regard to the defective sampling
methods employed. With this appliance, all the milk is poured
on to a strainer of very fine mesh, and thus by its weight breaks
up, forces through, and evenly distributes any lumps of cream
that may be present; and whilst still in this state of commotion
and perfect mixture, is rushed through the wide aperture, and
over a hole that is four times the size of the mesh of the strainer,
and therefore four times larger than any particles of cream.
This is sufficient guarantee that a thoroughly representative
sample is dripped through the hole; but I have abundant
independent practical evidence in support, as well as my own
experience, both in summer, with daily deliveries, and in winter
with deliveries every other day. To secure the complete disposal


paid tor separately upon tneir own tests.

of all lumps of cream, it is advisable to pour in cans of night’s
and morning’s milk alternately, and to keep a can of the morn-
ing’s milk for the last. If this method of sampling were not
accurate, the computations and churn results of the many
factories that have it in use, would not be in such thorough
agreement, and I may mention the instance of the Cobden
Factory, where an agreement between the churn and the tester
could not be obtained until this appliance was introduced.
Another of the advantages of this system is that it is auto-
matic, and on that account not only is it quicker and handier,
but all chances of mistake, carelessness or favouritism are taken
out of the hands of the milk receiver. Under the system of
sampling with a pipette, these dangers are always present, and,
as I am personally aware, have been a source of constant
irritation amongst suppliers. Unless the sample were taken
instantly after the sample tank was filled, it would make a
material difference to what depth the pipette was plunged.
In cases where milk is received both morning and evening
it is essential that distinct bottles be kept for the samples, and
that they be tested separately Evening milk is usually *3 to -6
richer than morning milk, and as the latter is generally a much
larger quantity, it follows that if an equally large sample of
each be mixed in one bottle the test will appear higher than it
should do. Speaking generally this would make a difference of
about •1, but sometimes more. Therefore the tests should be
kept separate, and the difference of quantity allowed for, and a
mean average struck, or morning and evening’s milk should be
paid for separately upon their own tests.


The following table, prepared from tests made at the Bega
Factory, conclusively proves the accuracy of the Drip Sampler
for mixed night and morning’s milk, and also the correctness
of the composite sample system. It likewise furnishes interesting
evidence of the variability of milk from the same herd from day
to day (thus showing the futility of occasional testing), as well
as the difference in quality between night and morning’s milk.
The experiments were made with great care by Mr. Eeynell.
The milk delivered in the evening was sampled and then put
back in the cans and kept till the morning. The morning milk
was sampled on delivery and run back into cans. Then the two
together were put through the sampler in the usual way.
In comparing the two returns it is interesting to note that,
although the individual tests and deliveries vary, and the pro-
portion between night and morning milk is noticeably different,
the summarised results are almost identical. The milk comes
from similar cows on one farm, though the herds are distinct:—


I have dwelt thus at length upon the detail of
because I regard the obtainment of a thoroughly homogeneou
sample as the bed-rock of the system of payment by results, and
the very essence of the contract as between the company and its
suppliers, and without which all testing and differential payment
will be vanity and vexation of spirit.
COMPOSITE BOTTLES.
For the Composite samples I have tried all sorts of bottles,
but find that for handiness, ease in cleaning, and suitability of
mouth, the best kind is a half-pound, wide-
mouthed graduated bottle, as specially
manufactured by Messrs. Eelton, Grimwade,
and Co., Melbourne. Round the neck of
this bottle is a brass collar, with the
name of the supplier stamped on it. The
collar rests on the shoulder of the bottle, so
that there may be plenty of length for the
composite bottle, name, and that it may be easily read
from above. The milk receiver, however, soon gets to know
where to lay his hand on a bottle, just as a printer knows the
letters in the “case.” The bottles stand in a tray with divi-

. sions, but for the creameries a box with a lock and key is neces-
sary to ensure safe transit to the factory for the weekly testing.
It is highly desirable that the composite bottles be kept under
lock and key, as there have been instances of the bottles being
tampered with by the addition of cream.
In these bottles the milk has to be kept sweet and fluid with
some preservative. There are several known chemicals that can
be used with success. Boric acid, formalin, bichloride of
mercury (corrosive sublimate) and bichromate of potash, but the
two latter on account of being deadly poisons, are out of court
when non-poisonous chemicals are obtainable, and especially
when they are so cheap and easily handled as boric acid or
formalin. It is not so much the presence of poison in the milk
bottle that is objectionable, as that it should be about the place
at all, and being handled by more or less careless people, if it

can possibly be avoided. To use the cogent expression of one
of my visitors, “ You never know when a poison will turn up.”
There has been a tendency lately in some quarters to make light


of this danger, especially with regard to bichromate of potash,
but it will be sufficient to quote Dr. Wm. Murrell, one of our
greatest authorities on poisons, who speaks of it as “a powerful
irritant poison. . . . Two drachms proved fatal in four
hours, but very severe symptoms from merely tasting a solution
of it.”
In the first issue of this pamphlet I advocated the use of
boric acid only, and it has given entire satisfaction wherever
intelligently used. This chemical was suggested by my friend
Mr. H. W. Potts, chemist, of Euroa, to whom also I owe
thanks for much other valuable assistance. At the begin-
ning of the week, about 45 grains (a teaspoonful) of boric
acid is put into each bottle; and if, as the milk is daily
put in, it be carefully stirred, or preferably given a rotary
motion, so that the acid may thoroughly permeate it, it will
be perfectly good at the end of the week.*' The bottles
should not be violently shaken at any time, as this may
tend to churn the milk, and for the first few days special
care should be exercised in this direction, or lumps of acid and
milk may adhere to the inside of the bottle. The bottles should
be well corked, and as the corks have to be constantly removed
and replaced, a good substantial one is necessary, and it should
be slightly tapered, and of superior quality. Special and
particular attention must be given to cleanliness, and both
bottle and cork thoroughly washed at the end of the week.
The peculiar blue or yellow colour sometimes observed in milk
is due to the development of microbes (bacterium cyanogenumj ,
which originate from the careless cleansing of milk vessels; and
if this occurred in the bottles, the samples would not be even
and fluid. Although the thorough washing with a bottle brush,
may be all that is necessary for ordinary purposes, it is really
not sufficient to destroy all the germs in the bottle, and it will
be found well worth while in summer time—whatever preserva-
tive may be used—to boil the bottles after cleaning, and thus
ensure more perfect preservation of the milk. To prevent
* Mr. Vagg, of the Melbourne Chilled Butter Company (which has adopted this system
in its entirety), informs me that their creamery managers are enjoined to turn the box
upside down’for a few hours every day, and that this completes the mixture very satis -
factorily.


breakage, put tbe bottles in warm water, and then bring the
water to a boil. If these details are attended to, and the milk
is in good order when it is received, no difficulty will be
experienced, even in the heat of summer; though, of course, it
goes without saying, that it is as well to keep the samples as
cool as possible. I may add that during winter I find half the
quantity of boric acid to be sufficient. It is as well to use as
little as may be found efficient, for, of course, there is some
slight displacement. With the full summer quantity, however,
we found, by most careful experiment, that, when thoroughly
dissolved, the displacement did not amount to more than 1 in 88,
which is hardly worth considering for our commercial purposes,
as it would have no appreciable effect upon the test. But if
absolute accuracy is wished for, it can be had, when testing, by
taking 17’8 c.c. of milk instead of 17'6 c.c., and adding 17’7 c.c.
of sulphuric acid instead of 17‘5 c.c.
FORMALIN AS A PRESERVATIVE.
Recognising the great importance of securing the most
perfect preservation of these composite samples, however, and
the advantage of being able to keep them for longer periods, a
look-out has always been kept for non-poisonous chemicals, that
might give even greater advantages than boric acid, and Mr.
Potts has now suggested the use of a new preparation, called
Formalin, which we have found to be a most remarkable milk
preservative.* It is non-poisonous, cheap, and very easily
handled, a bright clear liquid with little odour, and readily
soluble in milk and other fluids. As a result of our most
exhaustive experiments and practical use, we have found it to
be what the inventor (Sobering, of Berlin) claims for it —an
“ ideal harmless germicide.” Used in such small quantities as
1 in 1,000, milk has been kept in the most perfect condition, in
the worst weather, for several weeks, and when used in greater
strength, it seems capable of keeping it for an almost indefinite
period. Milk treated with 1 per cent, of formalin stood for three
months in Mr. Potts’s laboratory, in a perfectly sweet and fluid
* Our original experiments were conducted with formalin immediately upon its first
introduction as a germicide, and before it was spoken of at all in connection with
milk. Messrs. Schering now advocate its use in weak solution as a general milk preserva-
tive, and claim that it is as perfectly harmless and tasteless as it is efficient.


condition. It possesses several slight advantages that, summed
up together, may be said to place it in front of boric acid for use
in this connection. The cream in the bottles seems to be kept in a
more soluble and miscible state, thus necessitating less agitation
for its proper distribution through the milk. The formalin is
more readily soluble in, and more easily permeates, the milk
than a dry powder like boric acid, and hence bottles charged with
it require less attention at the hands of the milk receiver, who
has charge of them during the week. It has practically no bulk,
and therefore no displacement; it is even more easy to charge the
bottles with it; and it will keep the milk longer, if desired. At
the same time, I am not in a position to advocate giving up boric
acid entirely, for the reason that formalin has a chemical reaction
with the milk and the sulphuric acid, which, when present in
sufficient quantity, sometimes causes a large amount of floccu-
lent, curd-like matter to separate with the column of fat in the
test tube, and thus obscure the reading. I have made a great
number of experiments with a view to overcoming this difficulty,
and have so far succeeded as to feel justified in recommending
the use of formalin of a strength of up to 1 in 1,000, if the tests
be manipulated in the manner I shall hereinafter set forth, and
I hope ere long to be able to work out a simple formula that will
enable it to be used in higher strengths if necessary.
The formalin manufactured by Sobering and Co., of Berlin,
contains 40 per cent, of formic aldehyde, and its cost in Australia
is about 4s. per pound. I would recommend putting three or four
drops of this into the composite bottle, instead of the boric acid.
This can be most readily done by using a common medicine
dropper.
This is what is usually called “pure formalin,” and is not
the solution that is used for ordinary milk preservation and as a
disinfectant.
Used in this way the cost would be about 2d. for every 100
composite bottles, and thus it is considerably cheaper than boric
acid, and there is every probability of its becoming still cheaper,
as soon as it is brought into more extended commercial use.


I have no doubt but that, in winter, a less quantity of
formalin will answer the purpose —probably one or two drops in
a composite bottle of the usual size.
If, under the manipulation that I shall presently recommend,
any difficulty is experienced in getting a proper reading of
the fat, a combination of say one-quarter teaspoonful of boric
acid and one or two drops of formalin, might be tried.
As to the complete separation of the fat from milk preserved
with formalin, exhaustive experiments leave no doubt whatever.
The difficulty is only that sometimes the reading is obscured by
this curd-like substance.
The real cause of this difficulty with the curd is
exposure to the light , which sets up a chemical change in a
mixture of milk and sulphuric acid and formalin. Hence the
necessity for not shaking the bottles until all are ready, and can
be done in one act, and in the dark compartments of the cradle.
From thence, the quicker they can be put into the machine the
better. WKen the second edition of this pamphlet was issued I
did not know this, and have been much interested to observe
how the theory fits with the deductions that had been arrived at
by experiment. If formalin should come into extensive use in
this connection, and still present difficulty in testing, it may,
perhaps, be overcome by having the bulbs of the test bottles
made of dark-coloured glass. Probably this difficulty would be
largely overcome by testing in a dull light.
WEEKLY TESTING.
Except during abnormally bad weather, samples charged
with boric acid, or more especially with formalin, will keep for
more than a week, but I am of opinion that in ordinary cases
the testing should be done each week, to ensure giving entire
satisfaction to all concerned. By this means the average of four
tests is obtained for making payment at the end of the month,
and this would certainly be more satisfactory than if
it were made upon one test only; for it must be remem-
bered that this testing, to a large extent, is being car-
ried out by people who are unaccustomed to, or have not


the opportunity of securing, scientific accuracy, and are liable to
occasional slight error, which would be serious if payment of a
large supply depended upon it, but would disappear in, and make
no difference, to an average of four. Moreover, there are a
number of possibilities, or even probabilities, that would lead to
occasional failure, both in the keeping of a sample, and in its
testing, and when this happened (as it inevitably will), serious
inconvenience would arise if the payment was depending upon
it, whereas, on the weekly system, a failure need not be recorded,
and probably little or no difference would result from the
monthly average being struck on three instead of four tests. In
the case of large companies, with many outlying creameries, where
the testing is a heavy item, it might perhaps be extended to once
a fortnight in cool weather, but certainly that is the limit.
Since the second edition of this pamphlet was published
formalin has been in practical use to a considerable extent*
with thoroughly satisfactory results.
Mr. Wilson, of the Fresh Food and Ice Company, informs
me that he uses formalin without any trouble, and finds it the
best preservative for milk samples.
The following interesting experiments, which speak for
themselves, were recently made by Mr Reyn ell, at Bega, with
milk from five different suppliers :
Pure Milk.
Boric Acid.
Five samples of different milks were divided into three equal
parts. The pure was tested at once, the others kept for five or
six days.
We have now seen that it is perfectly feasible to take daily
samples and keep them for a week, or longer if desired, and this
does more than anything else to clear the way to a solution of the
difficulties of payment by results.


TESTING.
At the end of the week the bottles are all brought into the
testing room, and tested with the Babcock Machine. For the
creameries, duplicate bottles should be kept, so that when one
lot is brought in and left for testing, another lot may be ready
cleaned and charged with preservative, to go back again without
delay.
Before taking the test sample, the bottle should be sharply
shaken, so that the cream may be distributed through the milk.
Messrs. Felton, Grimwade’s bottle is marked to show the quantity
to put in daily (which represents about half an inch on the bottle),
and provides for seven samples without being quite full, and thus
room is left for shaking, which is a satisfactory arrangement
during ordinary weather. But it has been found that samples
(in whatever way they may be preserved) brought in from
creameries in hot weather, become slightly churned unless the
bottles are quite filled, and this has to be done to insure a
satisfactory testing. The objection to this is the difficulty of
getting the risen cream distributed throughout the milk in the
bottle, and to meet this I have devised a “bottle extender,”
which being held on the bottle after the cork has been removed,
provides room for shaking, and obviates the trouble of pouring
the milk into another vessel.
BOTTLE EXTENDER.


In the event of its being important to test a sample that
may have become slightly churned or be otherwise imperfect,
this may be done by testing all the milk in the bottle, adding the
results together, and dividing by the number of tests (probably
eight). The acid measure should be used for measuring the
milk. The little that may be left in the bottle after the last full
measure has been taken will not be worth considering, but it
can be treated by making up the quantity with water. In such
case, however, it will be necessary to ascertain and allow for the
shortage of milk in the last measure when dividing into the
total result. Thus, if eight full tests had been taken, and the
last measure was half full, the result should be divided by B£.
A measuring glass, graduated in cubic centimeters, is a very
useful thing in a testing room.
So as to avoid the necessity of taking a large sample on the
seventh day at creameries in order to completely fill the bottle,
Messrs. Felton, Grimwade & Co. now make a bottle so graduated
that the seventh sample will fill it to the cork. It has been
urged that the size of the sample should correspond with the
quantity of milk supplied, and, strictly speaking, this is, of
course, correct, and in cases of a marked variation of quality
and quantity, such as I have already referred to as between
morning and evening milk, it should be considered. But for
practical purposes, with regular suppliers, it is amply sufficient
to take the same sized sample each day.
For measuring the test quantity of milk, the measure
usually used for the acid is sometimes adopted on account
of its convenience, but care should be taken to mark it
for exactly the same quantity as a pipette holds; 17-5 cubic
centimetres is the exact quantity necessary for a test, but pipettes
are made to hold 17-6 cubic centimetres, because it is reckoned
that such a pipette would discharge exactly 17-5 cubic centi-
metres ; -1 cubic centimetre would be left adhering to the
sides.
No doubt sufficient accuracy is secured by using the
measure, but as a rule the pipette is to be recommended in
preference.


I consider that for factory use a 20-bottle machine is the
most suitable, and for small places an even smaller size is to he
recommended, for the more quickly the tests can be manipulated,
the better. As soon as the milk is measured into the test bottles,
the acid should be put in with a burette, as here illustrated, and
BURETTE.
which have been specially manufactured and imported by
Messrs. Felton, Grimwade, and Co. for the purpose. This
method is much quicker, cleaner, and handier than the old one
of using the measuring glass, though, of course, it is only recom-
mended for factory use.
In adding the acid, care should be taken to hold the bottles
at a slight angle, so that the acid may run down on the inside
of the glass, and get under the milk without disturbing it.
Allowing the acid to fall on to the milk, is one of the most
fruitful sources of charring, and is liable to spoil the test
altogether. Adding the acid should be done as quickly as
possible, and the bottles should be at once placed in a “ cradle,”
with as many divisions as there are cups in the machine.


As soon as complete, take the “cradle ” in both hands,
and give it a rotary, oscillating movement, so as to mix
the milk and acid. When this has been thoroughly done,
place the bottles at once in the machine, and whirl at the indi-
cated speed for seven minutes. Then add boiling water to fill up
as far as the neck. Then whirl for two minutes, and add hot

and pinch cock, placed conveniently on a shelf above the
machine, will be found a great convenience and saving of
breakage. Soft water is preferable to hard water, as the latter
will sometimes cause bubbles to form on the top of the fat.


Be careful to see that the gear is not slipping, or the
required speed will not be obtained, and the result will be
affected thereby.
When there are many tests to be made, it will be found a
great help to have an assistant, and much time, trouble, and
breakage will be saved by having a testing room fitted with
counter and shelves, and a washing lip trough with hot and
cold water laid on. To put through 20 tests will altogether
occupy about three quarters of an hour, and whilst the first batch
of samples is being whirled, etc., another lot can be prepared, if
extra test bottles are provided. It thus means, in the case of a
factory with 100 suppliers, that one afternoon a week is taken
up with the testing—not a very serious matter. In cold weather
the butter fat in the test flask shrinks and breaks up, unless it
is read at once after whirling. This can be overcome by just
standing it in hot water for a few moments before reading. The
clearness of the fat is often increased by warming it up after it has
become cold, and this may be recommended at any time if the
fat is not clear enough. In warm weather, simply letting a
bottle stand a few minutes will often greatly clear the fat out-
line. To dispel bubbles at the top of the column, Dr. Babcock
suggests pouring in a few drops of strong alcohol, but in this
case the reading must be taken at once before the alcohol unites
with the fat
THE SULPHURIC ACID.
Much trouble has been experienced by factory managers on
account of the presence of an irregular black substance in, and
beneath, the butter fat, which makes the reading difficult, and
sometimes impossible. This is due chiefly to the sulphuric
acid being too strong. The commercial acid that has been
supplied could not be depended upon in this respect ; but lam
glad to be able to state that the wholesale druggists are now
prepared to supply ordinary acid of an uniform and correct
strength (1 , 827=90 per cent.). Unless the acid can be relied
upon, the best plan is to get a hydrometer, and test it before
using. I never had any more trouble with the charring after I
did this. For this purpose an ordinary quart jug is suitable.


Nearly fill the jug with acid, and then bring it to whatever
temperature the hydrometer is graded at—probably 60 deg.
Fahr.—then let the hydrometer float free, and read it, and if
the acid is of too great a density a little water can be carefully
added and thoroughly mixed, though this plan is not tobe recom-
mended. It is best to reduce it with weaker acid. Another way to
meet the charring difficulty is to take a little less acid, and after
pouring it into the test bottle with the milk, let the bottle stand
for about 15 minutes before shaking. The acid, standing
under the milk, absorbs water from it, and thus weakens
itself. But this plan is rather inconvenient, and not so
satisfactory as the other. It has also been stated that merely
taking less acid, and proceeding as usual, is satisfactory.
If the acid is too weak, there will be curd noticeable in the
butter fat, and in this case more acid must be used.
In testing milk preserved with formalin as 1 in 1,000 and
upwards, I think a better result is obtainable by taking a little
more, or using stronger acid (say, 1-83 to 1-84). I have hardly
ever seen a charred test when formalin was present.
TEMPERATURE FOR TESTING.
But another potent factor in this connection is the tem-
perature of the milk before testing. In the first edition of this
pamphlet, I mentioned that no trouble had been experienced with
charring during winter, although I had purposely used acid
of a strength that would have been fatal to the tests during
warmer weather. More light has since been thrown on this
part of the subject by Professor E. H. Farrington, who had
charge of the dairy tests at the World’s Fair, and who says that
“ the action of the acid in the milk will be more or less intense
according to the temperature of the liquids.” With acid of
1-827 milk should be about 60deg. Fahr. If milk is 80deg. or
90deg., weaker acid should he used, or the milk cooled. On the
other hand, if milk is considerably less than 60deg., it should
be warmed, or stronger acid used, so as to prevent the separation
of curdy matter with the fat. It is much better and easier to
cool or warm the milk, than to alter tbe acid. It is also better


for the acid to be somewhere about the same temperature as the
milk. In any case, however, the necessity for either will only
occasionally arise, and these suggestions are made chiefly as
remedies and precautions against failure in abnormally bad
weather. When formalin is used as a preservative in any con-
siderable strength, however, I think more satisfactory results
are obtained when the milk is about 70deg. or 80deg., or the
acid correspondingly stronger. Greater heat seems to destroy
the curdy matter that I have spoken of, and that is why I also
recommand the speedy manipulation of the tests. I have always
found that when the acid was added and the bottle shaken
immediately before whirling, the test was clear.
The readings are always very much clearer when special
care is taken in washing the test bottles. It is a good plan to
have a small tin, fitted with a brass tap, hanging above the
wash trough, as illustrated. In this, soda, soap, and hot water

can be readily mixed and run into the bottles. It is also advis-
able to clean the necks with a small brush. The bottles should
be put away in a tray upside down, so that they may drain dry.
The underside of the holes in the tray should be countersunk, as
well as the top side, so that the lips of the bottles may not catch
when being taken out. When the markings on the bottles get
indistinct, rub in brunswick black with a piece of rag. For the
operator, an apron made of indiarubber sheeting, which is very
effectual in resisting the action of the sulphuric acid, will be
found useful.


BOTTLE TRAY.
READING THE BUTTER FAT.
In reading the butter fat, it is a good plan to use a small
pair of compasses, and having measured the fat, place one point
at 0 and read from that. In this case, however, it is necessary
to read on the same bottle, as the necks vary in size, and the
markings accordingly. The reading should be from the lowest
to the highest points of the fat- from A to B as indicated in the
diagram.
It has occasionally been found that test bottles have no
been accurately graduated, and this makes it important that
they should be obtained from a firm of high repute. They may
be tested by carefully measuring 2 c.c., or 27'18 grams of
mercury into the bottle and, after corking it, turning it upside
down so that the mercury comes down into the neck. The
measurement of the column of mercury should then be the same
as the total graduations from 0 to 10. This can also be done
with water, though less satisfactorily. The same mercury may
be used for many bottles, so long as none is left behind. If the
total graduations are correct, the intermediate ones may be taken
for granted.


SYSTEM OF PAYMENT.
The testing now being complete, we have next to pass on
to the methods of making the payment. From inquiry I find
that the general custom in Victoria is to receive milk by measure-
ment, and this I think, is decidedly the best plan. lam sure
it is quicker than weighing, and if care is taken to arrange for
cans of an uniform capacity of ten gallons, and of a thick
quality not readily dinted, it will be quite accurate, and very
readily calculated—a graduating measuring can being used for
quantities of less than ten gallons. By our system, the milk is
turned into the strainer and sampler, and it rushes away at
once, the sample being obtained automatically. Strictly speak-
ing, receiving by weight, as some factories do, and reducing to
gallons at an average weight and an uniform price, is doubly
unfair to the supplier of good milk, because the richer the milk
is, the lighter it weighs per gallon. The difference, however, is
not great, and in dealing with ordinary milk, this point is more
theoretical than otherwise. Some very rich milk will weigh only
10-20 lbs. to the gallon ; skim milk weighs about 10-36 lbs. ; and
cream about 10*15lbs.
Considering that receiving by measurement is much the
handiest, and that paying by gallons is the easiest and most
readily understood by the suppliers, ! have made the accom-
panying table, which, at a glance, will indicate the value of
a gallon of milk according to the market price and quality.
TABLE OF GALLON VALUES.
This table speaks for itself, and needs little explanation.
It has simply to be decided what price (after deducting cost
of manufacture and margin for contingencies) could be paid per
lb. of butter to the supplier, and in a line with that figure will
be found the value of a gallon of milk at the different per-
centages. For instance, if sd. per lb. could be paid, then a gallon
testing 3 per cent, is worth llid., and testing 3-2 is worth lf|d.,
and so on. If it is thought preferable to work on a mean stan-
dard, this can be done just as well, and the standard fixed at
3‘6 or 3 8 or anything else, according to circumstances ; but in
any case the values would remain exactly the same. This is
really only another way of expressing the amount of butter that


would be contained in a given quantity of milk, but the calcu-
lations are much more quickly made than by bringing gallons
to lbs. of milk, and lbs. of milk to lbs. of butter, and lbs. of
butter into cash, according to any butter chart system.
Using this table it takes a very few minutes to put in the
rates per gallon in the pay-sheet, and then a ready reckoner,
graduated in sixteenths of a penny (“Collins’ Universal
Reckoner ” costs about 2s. 6d.), can be used to calculate
the cash.
To illustrate the accuracy of the plan as compared with the
butter weight method, take 7d. per pound as the price to be
paid to suppliers ; a gallon testing 4 per cent, would be worth
3 T 3 ¥ d., and lOOgals. £1 6s 6|fl. By a butter chart method
100gals.=l,025lbs. at 4 per cent.=;4s-50lb8. butter at 7d.,
£1 6d. 6£d. It is not pretended that this plan is so accurate as
working into butter weight by decimals, but it is quite near
enough, for, the gallon values being in sixteenths of a penny,
the discrepancy could never be more than midway, viz., of a
penny, and this in 1,000 gallons would be only about 2s. 6d ,
and these trifles, when occasionally occurring, would compensate
each other.
There is really no practical necessity for anything more
precise, because work of this kind is in its very nature only
approximate. There is no tester, and no system, by which
absolute accuracy can be obtained in every instance. All that
can be reasonably claimed is that if, in the aggregate, the
returns and the computations agree, then every supplier gets
his due from year to year, and even from month to month,
within a very small trifle, as abundant testimony from many
quarters fully proves. Even separating and churning individual
supplies, if such were practicable, would not give a nearer
result, because there are many trifling circumstances that
affect such returns. The tester only shows, as nearly as it can
be read with ordinary eyes, what amount of butter fat is in the
milk. It is another matter, to what extent that fat can be
extracted and worked up into butter. And, moreover, tester
computations and butter results will largely depend upon the
method of making the butter, and the amount of moisture, etc.,
that is left in it. On this account, ultra-scientific objections
have occasionally been raised against the employment of butter
charts ; but, whilst in no way wishing to underrate the value of
scientific accuracy in this, or any other matter, it may be fairly


claimed that since our objects are chiefly commercial, and we
have to apply this science to the every-day dealings with un-
scientific, and sometimes even unlettered, people, a system that
comes within their understanding might lack something of
scientific accuracy, and still be deemed the best to adopt. More-
over, we can point to the fact that, in ordinary practice, charts
are found to be capable of making computations that are in
agreement with the average churn results.
My great aim in this whole matter has been to so simplify
its working as to bring it within the grasp of, and possibility of
manipulation by, all who are gifted with ordinary intelligence.
If we had had to wait for some scheme to give us absolute
scientific precision in every respect and detail, we might still be
devoutly looking to the clouds for differential payments.
The table is based upon the reasonable assumption —and
one which has been borne out by most extended experience in
America and elsewhere—that the average loss of fat in skimming
and churning is *22 per cent., and that the commercial butter
contains 85 per cent, of fat; or in other words, that the
resultant fat holds 17£ per cent, of moisture, etc. To illustrate
this:—
100 lbs. of milk testing 4 per cent, would contain .. 4 - 00 lbs. fat
Less for loss in skimming and churning .. .. - 22
Add per cent, for moisture, casein, etc. .. .. *66
Commercial butter .. .. .. .. 4*44
85 per cent, of which would be 3"78.
This 4*44 lbs. butter in 100 lbs. milk is equivalent to 22-5 lbs. of
milk to 1 lb. of butter, and it is in this way, by taking 10£ lbs. as
the average weight of a gallon of milk, that my gallon values
are arrived at.
It must also be borne in mind that this loss of ‘22 is fairlv
persistent, and bears its proportion to the milk, and not to the
fat, and hence the richer the milk is, the larger is the proportion
of fat saved, and therefore of butter made— e.g.,
100 lbs. milk testing 1 per cent, would contain .. 1.00 lbs. fat.
Less for loss.. .. .. .. .. .. ’22
Add 17| per cent, for moisture, etc. .. .. .. - 135
Commercial butter .. .. .. .. .. "915
Or less than 1 lb. of butter.
100 lbs milk testing 8 per cent, would contain ~ 8 - 00 lbs. fat.
Less for loss.. .. .. .. .. .. *22
Add 17£ per cent, for moisture, etc. .. .. .. I - 36
Commercial butter .. .. .. .. .. 9*14
Or I*l4 lbs, more than 8 lbs.


This is the basis of the table, which it is well that every-
body using it should thoroughly understand. It is probable
that there is a slightly increased loss of fat with the richer milk,
but this is most likely compensated for by a slight difference of
specific gravity in its favour.
Dr. Wanklyn and other authorities have considered that
the average specific gravity of pure milk is 1*029, at a
temperature of 60 deg. Fahr. This would be equivalent to
10*29 lbs. to the gallon. But as the average temperature of the
milk delivered throughout the year is considerably in excess of
60 deg,, and the average percentage of fat (the lightest con-
stituent) also greater than these authorities reckon on, no doubt
our average would be somewhat less. Now 10*25, or 10J lbs. to
the gallon is a much handier figure, and therefore, I think, that,
in view of the above facts, it may be safely adopted.
COMPARING THE RESULTS WITH THE CHURN.
Checking the results is a very simple matter. Multiply the
total pounds yielded from the churn for the pay period, by the
equivalent price paid for the butter, and the sum should
agree with the total money of the pay sheet; or vice versd,
reduce the total money of the pay sheet to pence, and divide
by the price of butter, and the result will be in pounds of butter,
that should agree with the churn. If the sampling and testing
have been accurately done, and the butter properly manipulated,
it will agree to within a trifle. The reason of this is obvious.
Every variation of the gallon values more or less is represented
by more or less butter yield, and therefore there will be a
correspondence between the total cash paid, and the total pounds
of butter yielded, at the equivalent price per pound. The
following pay-sheet, which appeared in the first edition of this
book, will serve the purpose of illustration, though monthly
payments are now recommended, and the average of four
weekly tests taken for payment —when the pay period is made
to end on the last Saturday in each month four, or five, tests are
taken for the average as the case may be.

The following fortnight there was a discrepancy, in favour
of the churn, of 12 lbs. butter—so that if we had paid for the
month, the discrepancy would have been 3 lbs. of butter.
During October and November, 1893, the amount paid to
suppliers was. £2,988 ss. 6d., and the churn result, at the equi-
valent price per lb., was £2,985 6s. 6d.

Creamery Butter Co., from milk supplied to 25 establishments.
the discrepancy was only 326 lbs., or less than 1 lb, per ton !

The method of paying suppliers per lb. of
butter fat is
sometimes adopted, and for small co-operative factories where
suppliers thoroughly understand the system, and milk is received
by weight, it is an excellent one. Multiply each supplier’s
weight of milk by the test, and divide by 100, and the lbs. of fat
he has supplied will result, thus :
203-400=203-4 lbs. fat.
Add all the fat together and divide into the total money
available for distribution, and the price per lb. of fat will be
arrived at.

methods are often most confusing— e.g., on the basis of 100 lbs.
butter containing 85 lbs. of fat and 15 lbs. moisture, salt, etc.,
Is. per lb. for the butter would be equivalent to Is. 2£d. for the
fat.
CHECKING THE SEPARATORS.
One of the great advantages of paying by results is that it
makes the employees much more careful. If payment is made
for the actual butter contained in the milk when it is received,
%e concern will soon go insolvent if all that is possible of that
butter is not taken out, and so separators and churns have to
be most carefully looked after. We adopt the plan of having a
bottle for a daily sample of skim milk from each establishment,
and this, as well as the buttermilk, is tested weekly and the
readings recorded. If there is an undue quantity of butter fat
being lost in either of these directions, we thus readily discern
it and investigate the cause. But seeing that it is possible for
samples of skim milk not to be representative of the bulk, and
for other weighty reasons, it is highly desirable to check the
creameries by churning, and if the manager is able to
keep each creamery separate, the results are very readily
checked each week. Take the deliveries and tests for the week
at the creamery in question, and work out an imaginary pay-
sheet on the Is. line of the table, the total shillings would then
represent the total pounds of butter that should be obtained,
thus:—
Equals 657 shillings = 6571b5. butter, which may be com-
pared with the churn result.
But it is not always feasable to churn each creamery’s
produce separately, and in such cases it is sufficient to churn one
day’s cream once a week (on varying days) and then make out
an imaginary pay sheet, as above, on the tests that are recorded
for that week.


CREAM TESTING.
It is a well-known fact that cream varies in its butter fat
value quite as much as milk does, the difference being dependent
upon the method of skimming, the kind of separator used, and
indeed even upon the description of cows milked, for the fat
globules of some milks are smaller than those of others, and when
rising in the cream will pack closer together, and cause the
volume of cream to be less in proportion.
With the concentration of supplies to central factories, the
question of cream testing has become a very important one, and
has engaged the earnest attention of most of the large butter
companies, and especially in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne,
where supplies of cream from one can upwards, are daily received
from many country constituents.
Apart from the trouble involved in the only available
method of churning each consignment separately, it has long been
recognised that by blending cream together in large quantities
a very great improvement is affected in the butter, and the
uniformity—which is insisted upon by an ever increasingly
exacting market—is secured. To obtain this, where all the
cream belongs to one establishment is comparatively easy; but
where any cream is received from other factories or creameries,
or from private separators, the much to be desired blending
cannot be done unless a satisfactory system of testing is resorted
to, and payment made upon it.
So far it can scarcely be said that the system has gone
beyond its experimental stage, and whilst much has been done
in this way, and several large companies are using it for
checking purposes, I am only aware of one establishment that
essays to ostensibly make payment by butter ex cream on this
basis—viz., the Bega branch of the New South Wales Creamery
Butter Company. Of this I speak anthoritatively, and can
say that under the management of Mr. E. Reynell (to whom
I owe thanks for much valuable information on the subject), it
has been a most pronounced success over a period of more than
12 months. The churn and the test computations have sub-
stantially agreed, and the suppliers of cream—some twenty in
number—have been satisfied with the returns.


I am permitted by Mr. H. Pateson, the Manager of the
Fresh Food and Ice Company, and by Messrs. Denham Bros., of
Sydney, to say that numerous experiments have been carried out
in their works with thoroughly satisfactory results; and I under-
stand that the same may be said of several large Melbourne
companies.
The only difficulty that presents itself in dealing with small
quantities of cream in this way, is the fact that it is not always
in perfect condition, and is often separated under unfavourable
circumstances, not within the knowledge of the butter maker.
On this account, as well as for other evident reasons, no doubt
the delivery of milk to separating stations under the control of
the manufacturing company, will always be the most satisfactory,
though this may not in all cases be possible on account of the
isolation of the farms. A thoroughly comprehensive system of
cream testing and payment thereon, would give the factory system
a much wider scope.
The actual testing of cream by the Babcock method has, in
itself, presented no serious difficulties, but the trouble has been
to obtain a satisfactory sample as a basis to work upon. Cream
delivered to city factories, for instance, is of a most varied
description. Travelling often hundreds of miles by rail, road
and steamer, it is of various ages, and sometimes lumpy and
half-churned. Nor is that delivered at central country factories,
from adjacent separating stations, always so satisfactory as to
make sampling an easy matter.
Of the many devices I have tried, the most satisfactory has
been a modification of the Lance Milk Sampler and Strainer.
A larger mesh is used, and a larger drip-hole of oblong shape,
over which there is a slide for regulating the size of the hole to
suit the consistency of the cream. The sample is caught in the
same way as the milk sample, and as the drip-hole is larger than
the mesh of the strainer, a satisfactory sample is ensured. No
trouble is experienced in passing ordinary cream through the
strainer, but with cream that has travelled far, and is lumpy and
half-churned, there is much difficulty. To help this I have
another strainer with larger mesh, placed close down to it, and


sliding across it. This has the effect of cutting up and forcing
the cream through. It can be driven from a shaft or by hand,
and need only be used when the nature of the cream requires it.
I think country factories would find no necessity for the extra
sliding strainer. The forcing of lumpy cream through a strainer
has a decidedly improving effect upon it.
CREAM SAMPLER.
Occasionally cream is so thick that it will not pour through
anything. A sample of this may be taken by another device,
here illustrated, and by which a fair sample, all through the
can, may be obtained. It would not be suitable for thin cream.
CREAM SAMPLER.


The samples may be placed in bottles after the manner of
milk samples, and kept with formalin or boric acid; but more
than three days’ collection is not to be recommended. Formalin
is to be preferred to boric acid for a preservative, as it more
readily permeates the cream than a dry powder.
Perhaps the most satisfactory plan of testing is to use a
pipette containing 8-75 c.c. (obtainable from Messrs. Felton, Grim-
wade), and having filled this with cream, discharge direct into the
cream test bottle, following it with the same quantity of water in
the same 'pipette. The water should be lukewarm, and after dis-
charging about one-fourth of it, the pipette should be well
shaken —a finger being placed over each end—so that all the
cream particles may be thoroughly rinsed before the rest of the
water is discharged into the test bottle. Before adding the acid,
thoroughly mix the cream and water, giving a rotary motion to
the test bottle. Proceed as with milk testing, and double
the reading.
Another satisfactory way is to take from the bottle a
pipette full of cream (17-6 c.c.), and discharge it into a
small tumbler, then, with the same pipette , take 17*6 c.c.
of luke-warm water, and discharge it into same glass. This
cleans the pipette. Then stir the mixture and take 17‘6 c.c.
of it, which discharge into the test bottle, and proceed as
with milk testing. Special cream testing bottles are obtain-
able, and may be used in the milk tester. As the cream has
been diluted with water in equal quantity, the test percentage
must be doubled. With thin cream, of poor quality, it may be
possible to discharge direct into the test bottle. Then use a
small quantity of water to rinse the pipette, and let it follow the
cream.
The chief objection to this plan is that sometimes cream
particles adhere to the pipette, and in such case any error
occasioned would be doubled. A number of experiments have
shown a tendency to give lower results by this latter method.
In any case great care must be taken to thoroughly mix the
dilution. I think decidedly that clearer separations of fat result
from this plan.


I have obtained very satisfactory results from using an
open glass tube with a lip, like an acid measure, and containing
8*75 c.c. marked about balf an inch below the top. The cream
may be poured into this, and then stood in hot water until
quite liquid, and in a state.to pour very readily and clearly into
the test bottle. An equal quantity of luke warm water will
thoroughly rinse the measure, which may be readily shaken with
the thumb held on the top. Discharge this into the test
bottle. Double the test reading. The Cream will expand
greatly upon being warmed, but this will not matter after the
correct measurement has been obtained. If the measure is fitted
with a handle, the warming will be easy, and the whole process
found to be simpler and easier than any other, and quite accurate.
It is specially suitable for thick cream.
In all cream testing, the temperature is a very important
factor; as evidence of this, observe the expansion that takes
place when warming a pipette or measure full. If this warming
had been done before measurement, a smaller quantity of cream
would thus have been taken. The sample bottles, therefore,
should never be warmed before testing. A temperature of about
65° is correct, and any great divergence from this, one way
or the other, will have an effect upon the results. In cream
testing we are dealing with a material that contains ten times as
much fat as an equal quantity of milk, and hence the errors of
manipulation will be infinitely more marked in their results.
Cream may be very satisfactorily tested in ordinary milk test
bottles by taking one pipette (17-6) or measure, of cream, and two
of water, and dividing as nearly as possible into three bottles,
and adding the fat per centages together; or, take one pipette
(17 6) or measure, of cream, and three of water, and mix in a
sample bottle (which is more readily shaken than a tumbler),
then take 17*6 of this mixture and discharge into the test bottle
and multiply the result by four. A pipette or measure of
8-76 c.c. capacity could also be used in this way.
Owing to cream being of a lower specific gravity than milk,
there is a correction necessary when proceeding with these


measurements, or, in other words, the quantity of cream taken
is really insufficient and not equivalent to the necessary 18
grammes, and the correction will vary according to the richness
of the cream.
The most accurate method, and one which requires no cor-
rection, is to weigh the cream, and for this purpose 18 grammes
should be taken and discharged direct into the cream test
bottle—the tare having been previously ascertained. This plan
has the advantage of doing away with the necessity of rinsing
the pipette, though it involves the use of delicate and expensive
scales, and it may give trouble with thick and specially rich
cream.
But for practical purposes, the measuring gives quite suffi-
cient accuracy, and by using the ordinary measurements the
correction can be made when adding the percentage for moisture,
&c.
A very great number of careful experiments, carried out
under varying circumstances, have led me to the conclusion that
no absolutely fixed rule, or precise figure, can be laid down to
represent the percentage that should be added to the fat result
in order to bring it into commercial butter.
Cream that has been properly separated and brought to the
factory in perfect condition, will undoubtedly yield a higher
percentage of butter than that which has travelled far, and
become over-ripe, lumpy, and partially churned; so that allow-
ing that none is churned at a temperature of above 58°, and in
the best description of churn, there will be a difference in the
percentage to add, according to the condition.
Experience under different circumstances will probably
dictate modifications, but from aggregate results that have come
under notice, and a large number of practical tests made, I am
satisfied that when testing cream by measurement, the following
table will give very close results under ordinary conditions. No
one experienced in cream testing will ever expect to obtain more


than a close approximation, but it will be as near as is necessary
for practical purposes, and certainly more accurate than churn-
ing a number of small lots separately. If proper records are
kept of the week’s output, any discrepancy that may be found
can be adjusted pro rata with perfect justice to the suppliers, but
allowance should be made for cream in bad condition :—

A proper system
of cream testing would bring more into
vogue the
use of bulk cooling tanks, to which a good deal of
attention
has lately been given. The
usual style hitherto
adopted has been a double tank, with brine between, cooled by
coils from the refrigerator. From these,
cream is
led in open
flumes direct to the churns as required.
But of late, the more simple and direct method of placing
the coils into the cream has been resorted to with pronounced
success.
Mr. W. W. Crawford, of Sydney, has invented an “ Attemp-
erator,” which consists of coils moving backwards and forwards
in an ordinary oblong tank, the connections being made by
means of a flexible rubber pipe. This is an admirable method
where cold brine is used for refrigeration, and it could even be
applied to a direct expansion system by a subsidiary brine
circulation.


Crawford’s ‘‘attemperator. ’’
Moveable joints have been used with direct expansion of
gas; but this is a method not unattended with danger, and
where gas is to be passed through the pipes, it is certainly more
satisfactory to have them rigid, for several reasons.
Messrs. Waugh and Josephson, of Sydney, have invented
an ingenious tank with a view to meeting this requirement, an
illustration of which is here given. The tank is made of tinned
iron and insulated. It revolves slowly, and a fixed coil of direct
expansion pipes, which are also tinned, is suspended in the tank.


CREAM COOLER AND BLENDER
Any Capa c/ty i/p to /,000 Oallo/ys
The cream is very completely circulated, and to such an
extent that butter colour may be put in with the certainty that it
will have thoroughly permeated before the cream is drawn off.
The tendency for cream to freeze on to these coils may be
counteracted by making a connection direct with the compressors,
so that hot gas can be passed through the coils, when the cool-
ing is finished, and thus thaw it off.


500 lbs. of milk testing 3 - 2 will make ..
45‘12 lbs. cheese
= 11'05 lbs. milk to 1 lbs. cheese.
500 lbs. of milk testing 4 - 5 will make .. ..
56 - 73 lbs. cheese
Considerable labour is saved by the use of bulk tanks,
greater uniformity is obtained both in quality and colour, and an
improvement in quality as a result of {crating and blending.
The cream sampler may be hung on to these tanks or
placed on a stand, and samples taken in the same way as milk.
TESTING- IN CHEESE FACTORIES.
In the case of cheese making, 'of course, the return will
not be so precisely proportionate to the fat in the milk, as it is
in making butter, because, in cheese other constituents of the
milk are used. The main arguments, however, will apply just
the same, and no other plan will prevent adulteration. According
to some recent American statistics—
= 8-81 lbs. milk to 1 lb. cheese.
So near are the results, on the average, that Professor Yan
Slyke states that, throughout a season, it is possible to
ascertain how much cheese should be made from milk, by
multiplying the test percentage by 2-75, but this does not always
hold good in individual cases. Fat and casein are the only
practical constituents that have to be considered in cheese
making, and it is stated that as a rule, and on the average, milk
richer in fat is also richer in casein, and therefore the contained
fat is a very near, and by far the fairest, guide to the value of
milk for this purpose, and it is adopted in most of the American
cheese factories.
If the above computation of Professor Van Slyke’s holds
good, it follows that 100 lbs. milk at 3'6 will make 9-9 lbs.
cheese, and 1 gallon of 10£ lbs. will make POl5 lbs., or,
practically, 1 gallon of milk testing 3-6 will make 1 lb. of
cheese.
For paying by results in cheese making, therefore, 3-6 would
be as good a standard to adopt as for butter making. The


value of 1 lb. of cheese, less expenses, would be the value of the
standard gallon of milk. Find the price in the 3 - 6 column of
the table, and pay up and down on that line according to test.
GENERAL SUGGESTIONS TO SUPPLIERS.
In order to secure results that are satisfactory to all con-
cerned, it behoves the factory manager to be particular about
receiving, and the supplier about delivering, milk that is in
good order. With the cessation of bonuses, and the keen
competition that exists, only factories that make the very best of
butter can hope to succeed. But no manager can make a high-
class butter with low-class milk, and it is directly in the interests
of every milk supplier to exercise the greatest care with his
produce before delivery—not only on the above account, but
also because it stands to reason that the testing must be more
satisfactory if the milk is good. We do not-yet know of any
chemical that will cure soured milk ; we can only prevent its
souring in the composite bottles, and therefore the introduction
of bad milk might be detrimental to the composite sample.
Some recent experiments in America have proved that by
aeration milk can be kept sweet considerably longer, and there-
fore every supplier should possess an aerator and cooler, and use
it immediately after milking. But if the farmer, who may not
possess the proper means of doing this, would even adopt the
simple plan of standing the cans in cool water and stirring
the milk occasionally, much advantage might be obtained in
this direction. The judicious use of a thoroughly reliable and
harmless preservative is to be recommended in warm weather.
But, above all things, it is necessary to have cans and utensils
perfectly clean.
Moreover, every farmer should make haste to secure to
himself the full advantages that the results system offers, by
paying attention to the butter-producing quality of his herd.
There are infinite possibilities in this direction, and the door
of complete success .stands ajar for every intelligent dairyman.
The statements I have elsewhere made as to the variability of


milk, will show the worse than uselessness of occasional testing,
and therefore every farm should have a Babcock machine, for
the constant and regular testing of the cows. Failing this, no
doubt, private tests could be made at any factory, but by no
means let them be done from an occasional day’s milk; adopt
the composite plan, just as we do at the creameries, and as
described on page 18. Label the bottles with the names of
the cows, and having put in a fair sample from each, every day
for a week, bring them in to the factory for testing. By this
means, I think, a fair estimate of each cow’s value may be
obtained, providing, of course, that she is in fair milk, and not
a mere “ stripper.”
The value of artificial feeding in this connection, is a
question that naturally arises out of the foregoing remarks,
but it is one that is too wide for treatment here. This much
may be said, however, that the evidence of a vast number of
American experiments goes to show, that while pasture grass is
in abundance, there is no other food so good and cheap for
milch cows. When that partially fails, as it generally does
here at certain seasons, improved results may be obtained by
the feeding of good ensilage with the dry grass, and in winter,
the addition of some grain feed.
An increase, or a maintenance of, the quantity of milk,
will probably follow as a result of such judicious artificial feed-
ing, but an improvement in quality must not necessarily be
looked for. The butter yield, of course, increases with the milk,
but the percentage of fat will probably remain much about the
same; though, no doubt, this will largely depend upon the
nature of the feed, and its suitability in each case.
In America it is regarded as certain that artificial feed-
ing pays, and there is no reason why it should not do so here,
and especially at a time when cereals are at a low price.
Questions of this nature are being dealt with at the
Hawkesbury Agricultural College in New South Wales, and
the Dookie College in Victoria, and the scientific methods
inculcated by such excellent and well-directed institutions (and


of which, indeed, there are too few), must aid greatly in
increasing the advantages accruing from a practical system of
differential payments.
From whatever point the subject is viewed, the conclu-
sion is inevitable, that payment for milk by results will be
an enormous advantage—an advantage to the factory, in that it
prevents adulteration, places it on a purely commercial basis,
and reduces expenditure, as a result of a greater yield of butter
from a given quantity of milk manipulated; a benefit to the
honest and progressive dairyman, since it gives him his fair due,
and creates an incentive to further effort; but, above all, will it
be beneficial to the country at large, in that it will inevitably
bring about a greater production of butter from a given
acreage, by inducing attention to breed, and to feeding, and to
the proper study and treatment of the cows ?
