An afleffment will be made upon this ftatement as at the com-
mencement of the year, and the fame penalties are enforced for a
negledl of this regulation. {■
This provifion is perfedlly confonant to the former Adi which
charges the Income of the current year, though it takes the Income
of the lad as the criterion by which the chargeable Income is (0
be eftimated; ani at the fame time has afforded the opportunity of
giving relief without any lofs ofcontribution to the executors or re-
prefenratives of peifons charged with affeffnient to the end of the

5 For


For in every cafe where this change of property arifes from
death, and the executor or representative would be liable as under
the Aid and Contribution Adi to the afleflhient to the end of the
year, the executors, &c. may on application to the Commiffioners,
and return of, the name and refidence of the perfon to whom the
property has devolved, be relieved from any further payment.
There is alfo a provifion made with refpedt to agents of perfons

hands to pay the afieflrnent, enabling the Commiffioners to delay
the payments, or vacate the aifclfrnent at their diferetion, on fuffi-
cient caufe being Shewn,fubje£l however to appeal from the furveyor,
Schedule.
The alterations in the Schedule do not in any way afredl the
Obfervations before made as to the mode of eftimating Income ;
having been introduced from an anxious care to take away every
expreffion that could be confidered as liable to mifapprehenfion or
doubt. The.application of the firft general rule is more particularly
pointed out, and the expreffion of annual value is introduced as
applicable only to the general rule j and other the expreffions fubfti-
tuted where annual value had before been ufed; other verbal altera-
tions are made in the fubfe.quent cafes ; and a distinction taken in the
15th and 16th cafes, between Income ofcertain and uncertainamounf,
though arifmg from Similar Sources.
The forms are alfo now made part of the Schedule.
A declaration is added to thofe forms, as to allowances dcduSed
by any party returning a Statement. This declaration contains the
name and refidence of the perfon to whom the allowance is made ;
and perfons having children arc at the bottom of their Statement to
add, “ fubjedt to the abatement claimed by or on account of a child
or children, by virtue of the laid AS.”

In cftimating the Income of a tenant, if the Land Tax, &c. be
reimburfed by the owner, then the rent will be proportionally
higher, and on that principle the A&. does not require that thbfe
fums fhould be included in order to form the aggregate amount;
but in eftimating the annual value of lands in the occupation of
the owner, thofe fums muft be included j and in that cafe the
rent at which the lands would let will be proportionally lefs,
on the fuppofition that the lands are to be let eftimated at what they
would bring fubje<sl to the owner’s payment of the Land Tax.
This proceeds on the idea that the Land Tax is a charge on the
land, and rr.uft be paid or reimburfed by the landlord, unlefs there
is an agreement to the contrary, ip vyhicfi cafe it is fuppofed the

I The EJlimate of Income arifing from Fines payable on the Renewal
of Leafes.
The Income of the leffor is generally made up partly of a referved
rent, which is to be calculated according to the rules laid down,
■where the whole corfftder.iticn of the leafe is rent, and partly of a
fine, which is to be computed on an average to be fettled by the
Commillioners.
The rule for fettling this average may be thus confidered;
Firft, it is clear that the fines are confidered as Income to the leffor,
and as deductions from the Income of the leffee.
No mention is made of intereft to be added by the leffor, or de-
duced by the leffee; neither is it confident with the Aid that the
intereft fbould be taken into conftderation, 'the fine therefore
muff be confidered as an unproductive luin paid out of the Income
of the leffee, and becoming the Income of the leffor. As thefe
fines are paid at different intervals, feme at the end of feven years,
others at fourteen years, and others depending upon lives, a diffe-
rent average muff be taken in each cafe.
Suppofe leafes have been granted for twenty-one years, with
covenants to renew, or where the ufage has been to renew the fame
