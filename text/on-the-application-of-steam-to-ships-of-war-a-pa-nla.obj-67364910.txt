ON THE APPLICATION OF STEAM
SHIPS OF WAR.
Before venturing to read a paper which I have prepared at
the request of our esteemed Chairman and the Council, it
seems to me indispensable that I should assure the members
of this Institution ?I am fully aware how presumptuous it
would indeed have been in me to have volunteered such an
undertaking, in the presence of many officers of far more
experience, and very much better qualified for the task, had
I not been urged by the Committee of Council to make
this attempt ?however much against my own inclination ?
with a view of eliciting other opinions, and raising a useful
professional discussion.
No result of human ingenuity and ability has attracted a
greater share of general attention and astonishment, than
that combination of ? a few pieces of metal, a little water,
and a little fire,? called a steam engine. No other single
object has more irresistibly rivetted to itself the devotion of
scientific minds, and the general interest of the community.
The history of the invention, from the days of Hero,
about a century before the Christian era, is familiar to most
people; and everybody is now aware of the importance of
steam engines, whether employed in factories, or on rail-
roads, in printing the Times newspaper, or impelling great
ships across the ocean.


The application of steam to ships of war having already-
caused great changes in naval arrangements, and indicating
yet further alterations scarcely less remarkable, every reflect-
ing inhabitant of the British Empire is interested in a subject
so vitally important to safety and independence.
It is universally admitted, that however ably defended,
however skilfully fortified the coasts may he, our principal
reliance as Islanders, is still on our ? wooden walls.? No
enemy can approach, except by water; therefore on the
water he must be met, and there destroyed. But the use of
such floating castles as scientific art has lately constructed,
their management, and the employment of forces afloat (in a
somewhat novel manner) must be deferred to the latter part
of this paper.
It is proposed previously, and as briefly as may he practi-
cable, consistently with clearness, to give an outline of the
general nature, or character, and properties of the principal
materials used in constructing steam ships, and marine steam
engines?with a sketch of the architecture, and peculiarities
of hulls : ?then to refer to some of the more remarkable
parts and characteristics of marine engines; and afterwards
to make a few observations on the personal (personnel)
portion of the subject, relative to commanding officers and
chief engineers.
Lastly, will be briefly discussed, the management of steam-
ers afloat?at anchor?and under way ?making passages
and in action.
If the remarks submitted to you are too superficial, too
meagre, and unsatisfactory, I must beg that you will make
allowance for the shortness of the time available, and for
the deficiencies of the writer.
The principal materials or elements used in the construction
of ships and engines are so familiarly known to all, that it
may seem unnecessary to mention them here; but I much
wish to be permitted to recapitulate (as it were) a few of their
peculiarities, which particularly require distinct and ready


recollection, while considering details of Naval Architecture
and Steam Machinery.
Air. ?Atmospheric air, not only presses or weighs heavily
on a vacuum, (or space in which there is neither air, nor gas,
nor other fluid, or solid,) but it is highly elastic. The pres-
sure of the air, or atmosphere, on a square inch, is nearly
fifteen pounds.* This great pressure, of which our bodies
are insensible, because accessible to air, will sustain a column
of quicksilver (or mercury) nearly thirty inches high; a
column of water (in vacuo) about thirty-four feet high ; and is
a chief agent in steam condensing engines.
Gas is also highly elastic, and generally invisible. Some
gases are light?some heavy ; some are beneficial?others
injurious if not destructive. The dangerous gas called fire
damp, is well known in mines: it has been generated on board
ships, and has caused terrible explosions. Carbonic acid gas
is not infrequent; and it is very pernicious, soon causing
death. Deleterious gases are formed by chemical combina-
tions in the lower parts of ships, especially steam ships?
bodies, where there is not sufficient ventilation: and they are
always prejudicial to health, even if they do not immediately
cause active disease.
Steam , it is almost superfluous to say, is water heated to a
degree that admits of, or causes a change from the visible
non-elastic fluid, to an aeriform and very highly elastic vapour.
This change takes place at degrees of temperature varying
with the pressure of the atmosphere and the quality of the
water, (more or less salt); yet these variations range but a
few degrees from 212 of Fahrenheit, (the usual boiling point
marked on a thermometer). Steam is invisible while separa-
ted from the atmosphere, or a cold substance, but becomes
visible, like white smoke, while cooling in the air. By the
absorption, or combination of caloric, or heat, with water, a
cubic inch of water is converted into very nearly a cubic foot
* It is customary to speak* of the pressure of one atmosphere, or of so many
atmospheres.


of steam, (at the ordinary pressure of our atmosphere) or by
the opposite process, by cooling, or absorbing, or abstracting
the caloric from a cubic foot of steam, there remains a cubic
inch of water. The precise najture of heat or caloric is not
known, however well its effects are understood. Its subtle
and mysterious operations, evidently connected with elec-
trical phenomena ?with magnetism and light, have yet to be
traced by philosophers. All that is material for us now to
bear in mind is, that to evaporate water, or turn it into steam,
heat or caloric must be obtained by the combustion of fuel,
and, other things being alike, the more fuel burned, the
more heat will be generated, (however wasted it may be).
Steam confined in a strong vessel, such as a boiler, becomes
more and more powerful in proportion as it is restrained and
confined. Degrees of pressure varying from one or two
pounds on the square inch (above the pressure of the atmos-
phere) up to perhaps one hundred and fifty pounds, have
been actually used on board steamers in the United States;
but in this country, marine steam engines have generally
been condensing, and worked at a low pressure, seldom ex-
ceeding ten or twelve pounds, until lately. Now there are
many condensing engines with at least double that pressure
of steam, and men of experience?engineers, as well as naval
officers ?are anxious to employ engines in the navy, working
at a high pressure and without condensers. But this part of
the subject must be deferred.
Water is usually considered non-elastic, and almost incom-
pressible. That it is slightly elastic is shewn by the rebound
of splashes; and that it may be compressed, though by
enormous force only, has been proved by various philoso-
phical experiments. For our immediate purpose it may be
considered incompressible and non-elastic, qualities at va-
riance entirely with those of vapour and gas.
Fresh water is lighter than salt water, it boils sooner, de-
posits no saline crust, and cleans the boilers, (by a chemical
action) therefore it should be used when attainable. The


peculiar and annoying effect called priming, or by the
Americans foaming, is explained variously. Some attribute
it to the more or less mixed, or dirty condition of the water;
others to the shape of the boilers and the want of space for
steam above the water. It is an ebullition of the water, in
consequence of which the steam carries some with it into the
steam pipes and cylinders.
Fuel is either coal, wood, or peat. The two latter are
mere substitutes, yielding but little heat, and therefore evapo-
rating water badly. Patent fuel is of various kinds, all mix-
tures of small coal with other substances. It has been an
object to combine strength, or great evaporating power, with
freedom from sulphurous or other noxious qualities, with
durability in form and nature, compactness for stowage, non-
liability to spontaneous combustion, or the generation of gases,
and economy: a combination of qualities possessed by no one
kind of coal. One or two varieties of patent fuel have
answered admirably, and are extensively used. The best
coal is Welsh, and the next Newcastle. In the United
States, Anthracite is in general use, for marine engines as
well as locomotives; but there is still an impression'?not to
say a prejudice?against its employment in this country.
It abounds in Wales. Anthracite, as is well-known, causes
no smoke, a very important quality for naval uses; not
only on account of freedom from the excessive dirt caused
by common coal smoke, but because of its not betraying
a ship?s position to an enemy, while at a great distance.
In a man of war, where so many men go aloft, and they
are expected to be clean in their persons and clothing, the
sooty state of ropes, yards, and sails, is a permanent nui-
sance by no means encouraging to seamen.
Supplies of fuel may often be required at sea, while
there is some swell, and even large ships are rolling. It
may also happen that fuel is to be taken in while at
anchor in a roadstead, where ships have much motion. The
common (however objectionable) method of passing coal in


through a line of battle ship?s lower deck ports would not
then be available. But coal or fuel may be hoisted in
over all, or (partly by derricks) through the main or middle
deck ports, whenever a vessel could lie near the ship.
Disturbing the lower deck, the men?s mess place, and scat-
tering coal dust about all their things, as well as dirtying
all the ?tween decks, is very objectionable. Iron pipes
should lead from the main or middle deck into the coal
rooms below; these pipes should be light and moveable,
fitted to go one inside another, in a set. Plenty of two
hundred weight coal sacks should be supplied to every
ship, and they should be kept dry and in good order.
Wood, as the material used in construction, need only
be referred to here in the shortest manner. Rapidly as
it is giving way to iron in merchant?s yards, it appears
to be the best material for ships of war; on account of its
superior resistance to shot, or rather, because it is not so
widely or seriously injured by the effect of shot, and be-
cause it does not do so much injury to the crew by
splintering.
Iron, answers exceedingly well for mercantile vessels and
packets. Improvements in their construction have succeeded
rapidly, and notwithstanding the failure of a few vessels,
built of inferior iron, and indifferently put together, there
are no ships in the world that can be pronounced superior
as packets or merchant ships, to some of those lately
launched, and others proved by long voyages.
The qualities of iron are almost as various as those of
timber used in ship building; yet iron ships are generally
considered as if constructed of one and the same material.
From the most inferior and brittle iron of the ?first
make,? (first make from the ore ?first smelting), to the
highly wrought material compounded under Nasmyth?s huge
hammer from innumerable scraps, there is every degree of
cohesion and durability. Inferior iron rusts or decays sooner,
breaks much more easily, and is far weaker than such ?scrap


iron? as is now used by the first-rate builders. It is certain
that iron ships may be made as strong as can be desired,
without unduly encroaching on stowage, or materially aug-
menting weight, because they can be fastened so much more
securely than wooden ships, and every part can be relied on
not to yield or decay. They may be of any required strength.
For some parts of the steam machinery of a ship, the
very best and most tenacious soft, (wrought, or malleable)
iron, is required; in others, the hardest steel. Some
portions only require inferior, if not cast iron; but in a
combination of such consequence there should be the most
vigilant superintendence. Mere dimensions are not a suffi-
cient guide, if quality be not also carefully considered.*
Steel is used for slide faces and a very few other objects.
Hard as it is, the liability to ? cutting ,? (as it is called) by
steam, (?) to oxidation, or rusting, and to heating under
friction, are remarkable. It heats and adheres sooner than
soft or malleable iron.
Copper is used for small pipes, and some of the large
ones. It does not vary so much in quality as iron, but there
are nevertheless, material differences in strength, tenacity, and
durability, between various kirids of copper. It has been
used for boilers, but generally discontinued. It yields to
great heat, is less tenacious than iron, and is more than
trebly expensive, though four times as durable. Perhaps
the most serious objection to it is, that copper boilers soon
yield or ? give out,? under the influence of great heat, near
the furnaces.
Brass ?the well-known compound of copper, tin and zinc
?is much used for joints, sea cocks, pump gear, and valves.
Soft metal, (Babbit?s patent,) is a composition of copper
1 lb., tin 50 lbs., and regulus of antimony 5 lbs.; valuable
for lining journals and stuffing-boxes, where there is great

heat and friction. When screw propellers were first tried,
hard bearings were used?brass, iron, or steel; but they be-
came heated and fixed, by welding to the shaft, and were torn
out of place. Soft malleable iron, or what is called ? soft
metal,? bear and resist the effect of friction without heating,
much better than hardened metals.
Vulcanised india-rubber is much used for valves. It an-
swers well, but requires to be watched and frequently
replaced, as it yields and loses shape by degrees. It will
evaporate under a very high degree of heat. Besides these,
oil, tallow, gasket, paint, white and red lead, are indispen-
sable materials.
SHIPS.
Having glanced over the rough materials, we will now look
at the ships? hulls, and then consider their engines.
To those who have studied Naval Architecture as a scien-
tific art, involving mathematical acquirements and much
practical knowledge, it is by no means surprising that so
many failures have occurred in building ships to be propelled
by steam. In fact, the time, ability, and labour necessary for
completely designing, drawing, and calculating all the ele-
ments of an entirely new kind of ship are so great, that very
few models, in proportion to the great number of vessels, can
be considered original and truly scientific?constructed to
possess certain qualities, known beforehand from measure, and
weight, and form.
By far the greater number?one may say all except a very
few?are more or less copies of other vessels, or the results of
trial and error. Not for a moment would I undervalue or
attempt to depreciate that sagacious skill and accuracy of eye,
or rather judgment, possessed so remarkably by some of the
most successful builders. Their experience is science to
them, however incommunicable to the minds of others, except
by results. But such skill and knowledge, acquired only by


practice, are at a loss when required to design and complete a
totally new form, to build a long steamer, instead of a short
sailing ship, to carry many weights, differently arranged,
heavy guns in extreme positions, and peculiarly placed
masts, with sails of novel dimensions.
Few persons only are aware, that some of the very best,
as well as some of the worst, steamers have been constructed
on the lines of previously tried vessels, more or less altered
by estimation ; and that failures were at first more numerous
in war steamers, especially those of iron, than in private con-
structions, chiefly because, although they were required
to carry unusually heavy armaments and a great number of
men, sufficient previous calculations of form, weights, and
displacement, were not made.
Except to those engaged in the subject professionally, it is
not enough known how necessary it is to adjust every thing
in a ship by weight and measure, in order that the various
centres may be duly placed, and that the draught of water,
the stability, the ease of motion, and the direction of effort
exerted to impel the ship may be such as are desired.
As clear ideas of tonnage, of displacement, and of the
centres above mentioned, are * not always present to one s
mind; it may here be convenient to notice a few points.
Tonnage or burthen, usually called builder?s tonnage, was
really intended to be, formerly, the difference in weight be-
tween a ship when light and when loaded; and therefore it
was the weight of all that a ship carried (when duly loaded),
irrespective of her hull. But from defective methods of
measuring the hull in order to calculate the solid immersed
in water between the light and load water lines, results be-
came very unsatisfactory, and new rules have been adopted,
which, however, are still open to considerable objection.
In ships built for sailing well and carrying a considerable
amount of weight, as our men-of-war, the old method of cal-
culation gives a result not differing greatly from the modem
?Builder?s rule for tonnage,? which aims at measuring by


weight, the size of the whole hull, not merely the difference be-
tween the light and load water sections. But even this modern
rule commonly referred to and used in England,*' does not give
a ship s actual displacement, the total weight of her hull, and
everything in and upon it, equal, of course, to the total
amount of water displaced by the hull while floating. This
is only attainable by calculating the cubical contents of every
portion of the immersed body, which equals the weight
of everything composing or resting on that body. And this
truly laborious and delicate calculation, which occupies some
weeks of close application, must be gone through, and is com-
pleted by scientific Naval Architects, when designing a new
class or form of ship. All weights are carefully calculated and
the body is cubed by portions: the weights where they will
be carried at sea ?the body (in sailing trim) divided into
halves, longitudinally and transversely. (Subdivisions should
also be made, but need not here be mentioned further.) The
centres of gravity of these half, or rather quarter bodies are
found, and the centre of these centres, which is the centre
of gravity of displacement (of immersion, or of buoyancy).
Now the nearer this centre is to the centre of gravity of the
hull, and all its weights, including masts and yards, the more
easy a ship will be (other things being equal).
But the application of these branches of Naval Archi-
tecture, the calculation and disposition of weights, the
adoption of them to the form of hull, their connection with
the position of masts, centre of effort of sails, line of steam
propulsion, and action of the rudder, are really among the
most difficult and tedious operations of the truly scientific
Naval Architect, and are only exceeded in difficulty by the
mysteries of dynamics, or the laws of fluids in motion, which
are not even yet thoroughly investigated and understood.
For our immediate purpose it will be sufficient to keep in
view the centre of gravity of the displacement, or immersion,
or buoyancy, (as it is indifferently called) which is considerably

as tonnage.


below the surface of the water, and to remember the distinct
difference between it and the centre of gravity of the whole
body, which is usually not far from, or nearly in the load
water line . The relative distance between these centies ma-
terially affects the stability.
When the hull is inclined or heeled to one side, the
centre of immersion (or buoyancy or displacement) is
proportionably changed towards the same side, and a
line drawn vertically from the said centre will cut a line
drawn vertically from its former position, at a point denom-
inated by Bouguer, and others, the Metacentre. This must
be above the centre of gravity, or the vessel would capsize if
inclined from an upright position. The height of the meta-
centre above the centre of gravity of the ship, multiplied by
the sine (natural) of the angle of inclination, at which the
stability is required, and also by the displacement in tons,
gives the moment of stability. Hence we see that length
and depth as well as breadth are concerned in giving stability
or stiffness to ships.
It has been proved experimentally, as well as by theory,
that, other things being equal, the smaller the area of mid-
ship section, the less the resistance to speed: but other con-
siderations must not be overlooked; especially the breadth
necessary for stability, for working room, and for stowage.
The centre, more correctly axis, of rotation, is that around
which a vessel turns horizontally : this depends on the form of
hull, effort of sails, and effect of rudder, besides the centre of
gravity. A moment?s consideration of the forms of widely
differing vessels, such as a Bermuda boat, a Bean cod, a Bombay
yacht, a junk, a cutter, schooner, or frigate, will illustrate this
movement. In addition to these centres, is the very impor-
tant centre of effort of sail, on which so much depends. The
position of this point is so intimately connected with the form
and trim of the ship, the stowage, position, and amount of
her weights, and the metacentre, that no alteration can be
made in any one without immediately more or less affecting


others, and the performance or motion of the ship. This
centre of effort of sail, (corresponding nearly to Bouguer?s
? point velique?) is usually placed with reference to the ship
under all sail on a wind. Bouguer thought it should be
where a line of the mean resistance of water at the bows
struck a perpendicular to the centre of gravity. Modern
authorities place it in a horizontal line which will pass through
the intersection of lines representing the forces of water
on the fore and after bodies of a ship, and at the inter-
section of that line with a perpendicular to the intersection
of the direct and lateral resistances of the water on the ship?s
immersed hull.
Hence we see what a very complicated and critically formed
structure a good ship must be; and how accurately balanced
those forces which affect her equilibrium under so many
varying conditions. It is no wonder that mere experi-
mentalists, unaided by study or by scientific acquirements,
should have been mistaken in their designs for new kinds of
vessels, for steamers especially, and that many failures should
have occurred. It is pleasant to turn to late improve-
ments ?to the Agamemnon, the Duke of Wellington, the
Imperieuse, Arrogant, and Highflyer, among men-of-war: to
the Bengal, Calcutta, Great Britain, Jocelyn, La Plata, and
other fine private ships. Larger ships still are in preparation,
although but ten years ago the Great Britain was thought
an absurdity?so much too large. Now her constructor
and his friends are about to build an immense vessel more
than twice her size, namely, 680 feet long, 84 feet broad,
and 27 feet draught of water. In a few days will be
launched at Blackwall, the Himalaya, (30 feet longer than
the Great Britain, ? to be propelled by a screw) for the
Peninsular and Oriental Company; while other huge ships are
ordered in the north. In all these vessels there is a combina-
tion of merits previously unattained, demonstrating that their
constructors have combined theory with practical skill to an
extent unprecedented. Not only have their constructors,


their architects, surpassed all former efforts; but they have
solved the difficult problem of designing ships which are as
good and efficient under sail as they are while steaming?
a result thought impossible a few years ago, and even now
hardly realised and appreciated sufficiently.
The mechanical construction, the carpentry, and ironwork of
these latest ships, (and others not yet tried or even launched) is
excellent. French and Americans acknowledge its superiority.
Other nations send to copy, to learn, or to buy, what they
cannot emulate. Yet those who are most conversant with
the subject say there is still great room for improvement.
In the lower parts of our ships, more than a few feet from
the water line, and below the reach of shot, or say from
their light water line downwards, it is thought that iron
might be substituted in very many places for wood, with
great advantage, especially as sleepers and beams; that better
water ways and means of ventilation might be contrived,
more efficient pumps, or rather water-courses leading to
pumps, better and more nearly water-tight divisions of the
hold, and much stronger fastenings abaft where the vibrations
of the screw are most trying. .Around and near journals,
bearings, and heated metal, iron should be substituted, not
only on account of wood yielding to great pressure, being
more liable to char and then burn, and occupying more space
(therefore diminishing ventilation and stowage); but because
all wood, however hard and durable, loses its power of resis-
tance, its elasticity, after long and continued varying pressure,
and then it admits moisture, and decays. (This is particularly
the case round the screw-shaft stuffing-box.)
Some of our ships, as the Sanspareil, have not answered at
first, from some defective arrangements of weights and from
being overmasted, it is said. An officer who has recently pub-
lished a pamphlet (in which he refers to that ship) seems to think
her rolling caused by too much weight placed too low, and com-
pares her condition (when first sent to Lisbon) to that of a ship


laden with iron or other heavy cargo at the bottom of the hold.
Are not the cases entirely different ? The Sanspareil had
no stability?she could not carry sail?she rolled and lurched
excessively, but easily (as far as such sweeping oscillations
could be easy), a direct consequence of being overmasted and
overweighted above the centre of gravity. Her engines were
higher and lighter than had been expected and calculated.
She had landed too much ballast (owing to that miscalcula-
tion) ?her shot were all stowed high?her masts, yards, guns,
and stores were all larger and heavier than now thought right.
Therefore she was crank and topheavy?not too stiff.
I have said little about paddle steamers, because a con-
viction prevails that they are yielding to screws, and will be-
come obsolete except for shallow water. The arguments used
in favor of paddles or side wheels are losing their force
annually, as the screw and its machinery are improved, and as
the construction of our ships? after-bodies is strengthened. One
of the most striking proofs of this conviction is, that at the
very centre of improvements and general knowledge in steam
machinery, a large iron ship (the Himalaya, 355 feet long,
building by Mr. Waterman, for Mr. Mare, was intended for
side wheels (paddles); but when half built was altered, and
is now ready to be launched for a screw. The Great
Britain was, at first, designed to be propelled by side wheels;
but even at that day, in 1841-2, Mr. Brunei advised her
proprietors to adopt the screw, and success resulted.
ENGINES.
While paddle or side wheels prevailed, the best engines
were the beam or side lever engines, which worked well
during many years, and under ever} 7 vicissitude.
As the screw has gained ground in public estimation, new
descriptions of engines have been adopted, of which, at the
present time, the best are said to be Penn?s horizontal trunk


and his oscillating; Maudslay and Field?s angular oscillating,
and Napier?s horizontal with gearing.
The cost of engines varies from �%O to �6O per horse-
power, according to the intrinsic value of the materials used,
the kind of engine, the patents adopted, and the reputation
of the maker.
Good engines ought to last (the machinery exclusive ot
boilers) more than twenty years, if carefully attended. Iron
boilers last from two or three to ten years, according to their
use and the care that is bestowed on them : copper boilers
three or four times as long.
Scarcely any two engines, even nominally the same, and by
the same maker, have in all respects corresponded. Altera-
tions and improvements have been in almost every case
effected. However desirable it may be to classify engines
and check their now indefinite variety, one may doubt
whether the time has yet arrived for such a decision. In the
work on this subject, published by Mr. Atherton, that gentle-
man is now well aware that there are unsound arguments.
Mr. Rennie?s (or rather Bishopp?s) Disc Engine has just
been brought to a working condition indicative of very ad-
vantageous future results. The remarkably small space it
occupies, and the extreme simplicity of construction, are
great reasons for encouraging its adoption. At present there
may be objections, as the pressure of steam may not be
well developed, though high, (from 40 to 50 pounds); but
acquaintance with it is alone wanting to make this engine
esteemed, perhaps second to none. It is so simple, so
manageable, so easily and quickly started, stopped, or reversed.
However superfluous to most persons interested in this sub-
ject, it may be advisable here to refer, as briefly as possible,
to the general operation and nature of a marine steam-
engine?that wonderful combination of iron, water, and fuel,
which now impels the largest ship in the world more than
eleven miles an hour through the ocean ?in a state perfectly


ready to sail as fast without steam ?to weather a gale?or to
encounter an enemy.
The simplest view of a marine steam-engine is to consider
it as a propelling machine, moved by vaporised water. To turn
the water into vapour or steam there are boilers and furnaces.
From the boilers steam passes to the cylinder, in which a
piston moves; the piston carries a rod which works a crank,
the crank turns a shaft, and the shaft a wheel or screw.
This is the skeleton of each except the Disc engine, in
which the piston works round its centre (like a broad
teetotum, about to fall), within a cylinder, and gives a rotary
motion (like that of a teetotum?s top) to the piston-rod,
which turns as haft by a continued circular motion. Above
and below the piston are very low cones?or conical surfaces,
against all parts of which the piston presses successively.
Engines without a condenser are worked by the force of
steam only, acting on each side of the piston alternately
or successively. Condensing engines have a power (like
suction) acting on one side of the piston, while steam presses
on the other side. And a very powerful action this ex-
hausting process ?the effect of condensing the steam and
forming a vacuum?is, requiring but a low pressure of steam
above that of the atmosphere (say four or five pounds on a
square inch) to keep it in very effective operation.
BOILERS.
On the size and construction of the boiler depends the
supply of steam. Boilers should generate an ample supply
of dry steam ?steam that does not hold water in suspen-
sion, mechanically, as is the case when priming takes place.
The occurrence of priming implies insufficient steam room
in the boiler, and is, therefore a reproach to the arrange-
ments.


When urged to contract the machinery as much as pos-
sible, to save stowage, and get it below the water line in
men-of-war, makers of even the best engines stinted them-
selves of boiler space; and some dispensed with steam chests.
All yielded more or less to the supposed necessity: although
economy of fuel, duration of engines, security against ac-
cidents, and actual power are promoted by ample steam room.
Through very small openings, or ports, steam is admitted
into the cylinder, and, after moving the piston, escapes into
the exhaust or eduction pipe, which opens into the condenser,
where sprinkled jets of cold water contract the steam instantly
from the size of (say) a cubic foot to that of a cubic inch.
A vacuum, or nearly so, is left, the effect of which is instan-
taneous in the cylinder, where, on one side of the piston,
there is also a vacuum; while, on the other, steam presses
violently, with a force nearly equal to that of the atmospheie
(about 13 or 14 lbs.), added to that of the steam itself (say
5 lbs.) above the pressure of the atmosphere. The water
thus formed in the condenser (with some air) is pumped out
by an air-pump, kept going by attachment to the machinery
moved at each stroke of the piston. Being heated, as much
of it is sent to the boilers (for economy) as is required, and
the remainder is forced overboard through the discharge or
waste water pipe.
High-pressure engines require neither condenser, nor air-
pump, nor great discharge pipe. An escape for the steam
that has done its work is alone necessary.
This discharge pipe is of inconvenient size in some ships,
considering that it is many feet below the water line, and has,
in those ships, no sluice, or slide valve, by which sea-water
can be kept out of the ship, while the engines are under re-
pair, and anything accidental prevents the large spindle
valve from closing accurately. At least three times this
happened in the Arrogant, owing to a chip getting under the
valve, or to the spindle of the valve being bent. Hei dis-
charge pipe is eighteen, inches in diameter, similai to those of


the Encounter and Imperieuse: that of the Agamemnon is
about twenty-two inches. She has no sluice valve, though
that great aperture is about seven feet below the water line !
The first time the Arrogant?s large valve was set up, by a
chip, the ship was light in Woolwich basin. Something was
amiss with the condenser?water entered fast, and several
feet were in the hold before a hawse plug could be forced
into the outer aperture.
It has been urged that if a slide, or sluice-valve were fitted,
outside, it might be forgotten, when about to work, and that
the engine would be broken down. But such slides are fitted
to other engines which have discharge pipes, and much
smaller ones, under water, and those engines have not been
broken down in consequence.
Let us now trace the process of evaporating water (or
raising steam) and moving a propeller.
The fuel laid in the furnaces for fires should not be much
piled, or too large in quantity. Small fires light more
readily, and should be increased by degrees. However
broken through unavoidably at times, the general rule should
be to get up steam slowly, so that the iron may be heated
gradually and uniformly, while the water becomes equally
and generally heated. This precaution will tend to prevent
injury to the boilers, and the nuisance, as well as risk, of
priming.
It is supposed that the boilers are filled, or ? run up,?
when, or before, the fires are laid. Of course no fires should
be lighted till the boilers are sufficiently filled. Fresh water
ought always to be preferred to salt, not only because it
deposits no caking sediment or scale; but because it acts
chemically in dissolving much of the sedimentary formations
encrusting any part of the boiler.
Upon the quality of the fuel, the supply or draught of air
(or the ventilation), the extent of ? heating surface,? and its
distribution, depend the rapidity and amount of evaporation.
To make steam, heat (or caloric) must be produced ; and to


produce heat fuel must be burned: therefore, the more heat
produced (all other things being equal), the more fuel will be
burned, or the converse.
But the shape of furnaces, the kind and arrangement of
fire-bars and grates, the description, number, and position of
tubes, the kind of chimney or funnel, and the form of boiler,
all affect the heat and, therefore, the evaporation.
The proportions of grate area, of heating surfaces (whether
the tubes be measured inside or outside) and of water e\apo-
rated in proportion to certain quantities of coal 01 fuel of
various qualities, are too intricate questions to be treated of
in this superficial paper, however interesting and really im-
portant they are.
Like the relative proportions of the parts of engines, the
mathematical calculations on which their dimensions are
based, the surprising exactness with which their effects are
foreseen, and all needful adjustments and counter-balances
provided?these, the nicer and more scientific intricacies of
the marine engine, must be left generally to professional en-
gineers, whose skilful ability and care we nautical men may
content ourselves with admiring, and trying? to turn to
practical account.
But there is one portion of the subject so necessary for
everyone to understand clearly who is interested in the pei-
formance of marine engines, that I must ask permission to
enter a little more into detail at this point.
I allude to the operation of steam in the cylinder, and the
measurement of its power. It has been mentioned that steam
enters and leaves the cylinder by small openings or ports.
(It rushes in faster than it goes out, therefore a smaller aper-
ture is required for the first.) These ports are opened or
closed by slides on the outside, so contrived that they alter-
nately admit steam to the cylinder from the steam pipe, and
allow it to escape into the condenser, by the exhaust (or
eduction pipe). The proper adjustment of these slides is one
of the most difficult dnd critically important parts of the


constructing engineer?s department. There are various
(short D?long D?locomotive, &c.) but their common
principle or object is what has been mentioned. Their face s
of steel, which slide against similar surfaces, are kept as
smooth and truly parallel, or even, as possible. If neglected,
they soon become corroded and leak, (or allow steam to
escape improperly), but notwithstanding the utmost care, an
effect is observed (called the cutting of the steam) in lines, or,
subsequently, small grooves. This may be connected with some
some galvanic or electrical agency. It is very like the effect
caused on iron, by copper or brass, in contact with water. The
steam pipes?and the exhaust pipes are frequently of copper.
We know by the steam electrical machine, (at the Polytech-
nic) what excessive developement of electricity takes place
in connection with steam.
The faces of the slides?which move to and fro through
a short space of their cylinder?s length?not differing greatly
from the size of their ports ?are adjusted so as to open or
shut, sooner or later, by being more or less cut away
(shortened) or lengthened. Cutting away, is called giving the
slide ? lead,? (because it helps to lead the steam into the
cylinder); lengthening the slide face is called giving it ?lap,?
(because it partly overlaps the port). By these nice adjust-
ments ?so simple when closely examined?and not mystified,
the flow of steam is regulated in the cylinder.
Independent of the slides, the steam is under the constant
control of the throttle valve, which may cut off more or less
steam in its progress through the steam pipe, from the boiler
to the cylinder?or stop its passage entirely. When the
steam is much checked by thus partially closing the steam
pipe, it is said to be ? wire drawn.? Some persons used to
consider that wire drawing the steam was equivalent to
working ? expansively ,? but that error is now generally
recognized?although, perhaps there is nothing connected
with the steam engine?about which there has been more
unnecessary mystification?or which more requires examina-
tion?than this working expansively.


If steam were allowed to enter the cylinder during the
whole stroke of the piston, its strength at the end of the
stroke would be too great, it would interfere with the rapid
return of the piston, and check the immediate operation of
the exhaust, or rather the condenser. Generally speaking,
the faster a piston moves, the sooner steam must be cut
off or stopped?varying from seven-tenths to five-tenths (or
half) the length of the stroke.
The piston does not ? travel? quite to the ends of the
cylinder, small spaces are left for the first access of steam to
start the piston, and for a small quantity of air, or even
water that may be there. Sometimes water is carried with
steam, by priming, from the boiler into the cylinder; if this
cannot escape, and it cannot pass so rapidly into the conden-
ser as steam, it accumulates in the cylinder, and being almost
incompressible, causes its fracture. Many? very many engines
have been thus broken down. Escape valves, intended to
allow such imprisoned water to escape, are not large enough
to effect the purpose when most wanted; but there isa? very
ingenious and (then) quite new? method?(l quote Mr. Penn s
words in a letter to myself, dated January 18th, 1851); de-
vised by Mr. Houghton, of Woolwich, by which, whether
used with or without escape valves, not only the risk and
probable danger of a break down from this cause may be
avoided, but the engines themselves may be made to exert a
greater power with safety, when their utmost force is most
needed? in towing, for example?or clawing off a lee shore
in heavy weather.
Mr. Houghton?s alteration of the slides ensures the ex-
haust side being open to the very end of the stroke, so that
any water which may be in the cylinder must be forced out
into the condenser; the aperture being much larger than
that of any escape valve, which, it should be observed, may,
and should be retained, as an additional security.
By Mr. Houghton?s method of fitting the slides, may be
obtained not only this advantage, but the means of working


and save the fuel for a time when there is but little, or a
contrary wind.
Striking instances (apparently to me) of a very mistaken
view of economising fuel, appear in printed descriptions of
the Inflexible s voyages. For example?That steamer was
said to have run from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia
very economically, by expansive working, and expending
only a comparatively small quantity of coal; small as com-
pared with what she would have burned had she steamed at
full power all the way in a calm. But between the Cape
and Australia, strong westerly winds prevail. The Inflexible
was under sail the greater part of the time, and had she
stopped her engines, supposing her floats off, she might have
made the passage nearly as soon without expending any coal.
(Certainly a screw steamer would.) The Inflexible?s engines
were giving her the greater part of that time a very little way
indeed beyond that caused by wind and sea, while the ex-
pense of coal (the constant expense) due to, or required for
overcoming friction, and moving the wheels sufficiently to
prevent their dragging, was as great during the whole time as
if there had been no wind impelling the ship.
In the tiials of the Lisbon squadron, in 1850, many ex-
periments were made to see with how little power sufficient
way (or speed) might be obtained. In these, when one or
two boilers only were used, it was found necessary?indispen-
sable?to work the steam expansively, or to throttle it, to
prevent its escape from the boiler through the cylinder too
rapidly, and thus causing inability to ? keep steam.? Hence
the results obtained were not quite those sought for, and
so exceedingly desirable; namely, to know with how little
steam or boiler power a certain amount of tonnage could be
moved at a certain rate?because the inertia and friction of
the engines consumed so much more steam than would
have been necessary for effectively working engines similarly
constructed but proportionate to the smaller power of steam.
It is a nice and difficult point to determine how far ex-


pansive working maybe advantageously carried under varying
circumstances. Those who say it is a fallacy, are opposed
to a great majority; able, as they individually may be in
practical as well as theoretical engineering:?while the advo-
cates of an opposite extreme ought to bear in mind that to
expand advantageously, the first effort of the steam must be
powerful, that the fires must be kept up well, if not forced,
to ensure this strength of steam, and that to make steam
stronger, fuel must burn more rapidly.
In considering the most economical method of reaching a
port when short of fuel, (with reference to Captain Ryder s
printed discussion of the subject) much reflection and dis-
crimination are required, lest fuel should be wasted in what
may be called its constant of expense, namely, in merely
turning the engines.
The strength of steam is measured by the now generally
known and used ? Indicator,? invented by Watt. This little
instrument may be applied to the cylinder, boiler, or other
places ; a minute hole only being required to admit steam
into the instrument, when fixed. It is a very small cylinder
in which is a piston bearing against a spiral spring, and
carrying a pencil that presses lightly upon a paper, or
card, attached to a roller which revolves as the piston moves,
having a line attached to the machinery. One stroke is made
as the piston goes each way ?the result is a complete figure
or diagram, traced on the paper, or card, which shews at once
approximately to the eye how the engines are performing,
and afterwards, when carefully measured and calculated, what
is the actual power exerted by the steam. This beautiful
and accurate index affords not only a measure of the whole
power, but also shews the power exerted at each part of the
stroke. It is, in the hands of a skilful person, most valuable,
and cannot be too highly appreciated. It may be said to
show the working and the state of the heart of the steam
engine; it is a steam stethoscope; or it may be said to tell
the condition of the spirit of that imaginary monster which


seems to lie fettered and obedient at the bottom of a great
ship.
The calculation of results from indicator diagrams is very-
simple when divested of mystery. The height at which the
pressure of the atmosphere solely would keep the pencil of the
indicator, is shewn by a line drawn across the card by the
pencil while influenced only by the atmosphere. The length
of the figure is divided into equal parts, by any convenient
scale, and the pressure of steam above the line, and that
below, (which might be called exhaustion) are measured by
the scale to which the indicator is divided ; one-tenth of an
inch usually representing one pound pressure on a square
inch. Then, mechanically, with compasses, or dividers, a
certain number of equi-distant ordinates are measured, and
their mean length taken as representing the average pressure
on the piston during one stroke. This mean pressure multi-
plied by the velocity of the piston (or the number of feet
travelled by it in a minute), and again by the area of the
piston in square inches, gives a product which, divided by
33,000, (the number of pounds one horse is supposed to raise
a foot high in a minute,) gives the indicator horse power, or
indicated power of the engines.
This indicated power is now seldom less than twice the
nominal. It is often three times greater, and there are in-
stances in which it is four or five times greater than the
nominal or contract power of the engines.
The nominal or commercial horse power, as is now well
known, only refers to sizes and weights?to the dimensions of
an engine by which it is valued in the market, or ordered
from the maker.
There must be some determinate scale, according to which
a contract may be made, before the construction of an engine
is commenced. Probably the present method might be greatly
improved, but, like an alteration of coinage, innovation is
much resisted.
High pressure engines are thought (by many persons of


experience in such matters and competent to judge of them,)
to he better suited to ships of war than condensing engines.
Less space would he occupied, and they would he con-
siderably lighter, at equal powers.
Much of the objection to high pressure has been removed
since locomotive engines have become our constant travelling
companions, and the pressure in condensing engines has been
so greatly increased. In such engines as these, where the
pressure rises to twenty or thirty pounds, or even more, there
are the principally objectionable features of high pressuie
steam without the advantages of less weight and more stowage.
The disasters so frequently heard of in America, result
chiefly from very defective workmanship, and reckless want
of care, or from determination to <c go-a-head, at all risks.
The little ? Isabel,? made her Arctic voyage with a high
pressure engine, and several merchant steamers have adopted
the principle. But our government has been vigilant a
frigate is to be fitted with high pressure engines, (as a trial)
which are now' in progress, and much will depend on the result.
PADDLE AND SCREW.
It appears unlikely that the Admiralty will construct many
more paddle steamers, except of a light draught of water.
The less the depth of immersed hull, the less advantageously
the single screw acts, and conversely. The contrary is the
case with the paddle.
Two screws have been adopted for shallow water, one on
each side of the dead wood. Two screws and two rudders,
in two distinct and separate arrangements of after-keels and
dead wood, are also recommended by the same gentleman,
who has shewn what appeared to be their advantages, by
models. But the watch-work power in those models was
indefinite, (as one may say) it would have turned any number
of screws, and each one would of course have added to the
impelling force. It is not so with an engine which has no


measured across, through the centre, like the diameter of a
circle. The angle is the inclination of the periphery, or outer
boundary line, to the axis or shaft. The length is measured
along the shaft at the roots of the blades. The area is the
surface on one side of each blade.
It was at first supposed that the greater area the better.
Trials soon dispelled that idea. Gradually the areas of screws
have been made less and less in proportion to diameter, and
hitherto the smaller seem to have been the better. More
than two blades cannot be raised conveniently through the
trunk; but some merchant ships which do not raise their
screw, the Great Britain for example, prefer three-bladed
screws.
Lately, Griffith?s screw has opposed all previously received
opinions, by completely reversing the blades, having the widest
part near a large central boss (very similar to Woodcroft?s
and Maudslay and Field?s), and the narrower part outwards.
With this screw an increase of speed has been obtained, in
the fairest trials, with a great diminution of vibration.
The change of pitch is not a novelty. Woodcroft urged it
previously; but to Mr. Griffith is undoubtedly due the merit
of a change in form, which has produced beneficial results.
How and why such results have been obtained deserves at-
tentive consideration.
In a screw of the form usually known as Smith?s, the
outer part chiefly acts in the water so as to propel the ship:
the inner part or root, does little more than drive the water
round and round. Whether, therefore, there be what is
usually called a ? choking? of water near the centre or a
solid sphere of metal, will not affect the ship?s way differently.
But if a sphere be there, some water driven from the blades,
impinging on it, will be deflected aft, and tend to increase the
ship?s way.
It has been usually supposed that equal areas of blade act
more forcibly the farther removed from the centre, as in the
sails of windmills. But the cases are not similar. The mill


sails are turned by the wind: they do not advance. The
screw is turned by its centre, in the water, and advances like
a screw in a nut. Of equal areas, set at similar angles, (say
a square foot, near the centre, compared with a square foot
on an arm removed from the centre,) having equal powers
applied to the shafts to turn them, that area nearest the
centre would advance the faster, because it would have much
less distance to travel in its circuit, and, therefore, it would
impel the ship faster. Again, with a screw wide at the end
of the blade, and of such diameter that there is very little
space between the outer edge and the ship?s keel, or the
guard frame (of the screw), there is some resistance to its
rotation at each time the screw is nearly vertical; not only
from water being forced against the upper and lower resisting
places just mentioned, but against the two posts (stern and
rudder posts). Moreover, there is a tendency to lift the
screw bodily each time it is nearly horizontal; because the
blade going down is more resisted by the water below it than
the rising blade is by the water above?for two reasons: ?
the upper water, that nearest the surface, is more easily dis-
placed than the water below, and the water from under the
ship?s bottom has an immediate upward tendency. The re-
sult is a vibratory or thumping motion, more or less felt in
most cases, which causes the upper part of the after shaft
bearing to wear away faster than the lower one ; ?and which,
when the bearings are much worn, become a serious nuisance
to all on board, as well as detrimental to the caulking, to the
fastenings, and consequently to the strength of the ship?s
after-body. The form of Griffith?s screw is theoretically in
favour of diminishing these effects considerably, and it has
been found, practically, that such is the fact.
It is remarkable that the screw which has caused the least
vibration, comparatively, and which has produced the greatest
speed in proportion to its diameter, revolutions, and propelling
power of steam employed, is that which has always had the
greatest resemblance to Griffith?s ?namely, Maudslay and
Field?s.


The more brilliant results obtained by other screws, on
Smith?s principle, are to be attributed, perhaps, to the excel-
lence of the machinery, the power of steam employed, and
the nicely-calculated pitch of the screw employed, rather than
to the distribution of that screw?s area, along the length (in
diameter) of the blade.
In elucidation of this subject allusion may be made to the
usual forms of Indian paddles, which are all more or less
diminished in width towards the ends. If we follow the
stroke of a paddle through the water, we see that the outer
end describes a larger curve, and travels through the water
faster than the part nearer the water?s surface; and we know
that the water near the surface is more easily displaced than
that below.
There are, then, good reasons why a paddle should be
wider near the water?s edge (when immersed) than at the
point or end below: ?the resistance varying as the area
multiplied into the velocity, and the velocity increasing with
the length of the blade. To obtain a uniform resistance to
muscular action throughout the length of the blade,
and thus avoid throwing the whole effect towards the end,
w'hich would not only cause vibration, but tend to break the
paddle ?a form has been adopted, as the result of experience,
which resembles that of Griffith?s screw. Latterly Messrs.
Maudslay and Field have narrowed their screw blades; and
when we reflect on the shape of an oar, and think how little
slip even that narrow surface has, we may suspect that there
will be further improvement yet in screw propellers.
The principle of a Bomerang appears to me quite uncon-
nected with that of a screw.
Here are several Bomerangs: they are all more or less
curved, but not spirally. They are nearly flat surfaces, unless
where accidentally warped. What is the peculiarity of this
Australian weapon ? It is thrown at an object, but, if it does
not hit anything, it returns to the place it was thrown from,
by a curious consequence of the rotatory movement over-
coming the direct impulsion. As a proof that it is not owing


to any spiral or screw-like form, a piece of card, perfectly
flat, cut into the form of a bomerang, will rotate and return
in a similar manner.
But be this as it may, the form of screw which Sir Thomas
Mitchell proposed immediately on his arrival in this country,
was simply a section of a spiral surface taken longitudinally
and diagonally, connected to the axis by two roots.
With such a form, such a distribution of area, all directly
available, and no part tending to choke or drive water round
and round towards the centre, there would be every reason
to expect good effects, if the aperture were long enough, and
the roots attaching the blades (two to each) strong enough.
But as such an aperture was not to be found?to avail
himself of an opportunity granted by the Admiralty?Sir
Thomas has so altered his plan, that the propeller has still
less, or rather no kind of, resemblance to a bomerang.
Theoretically, the section of a spiral, first adopted by him,
offers great advantages, because all its area is available ; but
the practical difficulties of construction now appear in-
superable, unless a vessel be built for the purpose, with a
long aperture (which might weaken her considerably).
By repeated trial and error a form of screw may be devised
that will be superior to many less carefully considered, of
which number the Conflict?s own screw is certainly one ; but
that there is a legitimate connection between a bomerang
and a screw, greater than there is between a bomerang and
a wheel, I venture to deny.
A hoop, thrown to a distance in the air, with a backward
rotary movement given by a jerk as it leaves the hand, will
fly some distance away, and then come back again, some-
thing like a bomerang: but there is no screwing motion,
nor is there anything analogous to it, except turning round.
The slip or loss of a screw is very much smaller than would
be supposed. When the vessel is moving slowly and the
screw has an unusual load, a greater task to perform than is
generally the case, as when towing or driving against a head
sea or gale of wind, there will be a great deal of slip, perhaps


fifty per cent or more; but under ordinary circumstances,
with good engines and well-formed screw, ten per cent is a
fair average of actual slip. Ido not confound here the
actual slip with what is called negative slip?a term perhaps
less suitable than the expression counter-slip.
When a ship is going fast it is well known that what is
called ? dead water? follows in her wake, or rather, leaves
the stern less swiftly than water on each side. (Heaving
the log shows this.) Water closes up from beneath the ship
and from each side, to fill the space she leaves, and in this
following dead water the screw does much of its work. Of
course it slips quite as much in that water as any other ; but as
the water itself has a movement towards or after the ship, the
screw advances faster, over the ground, than it would in still
water.
The faster a ship goes, the more this apparent anomaly is
observed, which at first perplexed theoretical men exces-
sively, as they said it was impossible the screw could advance
faster than its form and speed would allow in still water,
without a load to impel.
Trials under canvas shewed the fact still more plainly.
However fast a ship went by her canvas, still the screw not only
kept pace, and did not impede by dragging; but it actually
added to the speed given by sails alone.* It was not
? over-run.? On the contrary, it added, in the proportion due
to the known dynamical law?velocity or speed increasing
as the squares of the resistances, and therefore of powers
necessary to overcome them. Thus if 10 horses? power gave
4 knots? speed, 100 horses? power would be required to give
8 knots, and no less than 10,000 horses? power would be
necesssary to produce a speed of 16 knots an hour.
I would add one word here about raising and lowering the
screw. By practice not only in the Royal Navy, but in
other services, it has been proved that no plan answers better
than the plain ? seaman?s purchase,? originally suggested
and adopted by Captain Austin.
* In a very sharp vessel the screw may possibly be over-nm.


Complicated mechanical arrangements, however beautiful
they may appear on paper, are not only more expensive, but
they do not answer so well as the simple runner and tackle.
When engineers themselves place the screw, tackles are used.
Why should not seamen use similar means, when they are left to
their own resources ? Happily this is the opinion of that true
and experienced seaman?s friend and advocate, Sir Baldwin
Walker ; so we shall not hear much longer of hydraulic rams,
or other too clever artifices, on board ships of war.
The classification of engines has been much insisted on.
It is comparatively easy to classify things settled and com-
pleted?ships ?guns?masts?sails?may be classified advan-
tageously no doubt, but so complicated and hitherto varying,
have been the combination of ships engines, that it has been
impracticable to classify completely. Witness the changes
since Mr. Atherton wrote his book in 1850. Certainly there
are not two engines exactly similar in the navy, though a
few are said to be so, and many, not all, of their parts were
made from the same drawings, if not moulds. The Impe-
rieuse, Arrogant, and Encounter, are examples.
While bodies differ in size and form, of ships as of men,
machinery must be fitted to hulls, as coats must be cut to the
shape.
Here I would submit a few observations on the personnel
part of our subject ?namely, the officers and men employed
in Her Majesty?s service on board steamers.
As a point of importance to the nation, as well as to the
navy?it seems indispensable that the largest class of steam
ships should be intrusted to men who have had expe-
rience?who have commanded large ships, and, if possible,
who have been under fire. If they have a practical acquain-
tance with steam, so much the better; but the ship and her
general efficiency must be first considered. The engine is a
secondary, however important a consideration.
Some naval officers who may be good on paper, or even as
practical engineers, may want skill in seamanship, in dis-
d2


ciplining a numerous crew, and in handling or manoeuvring
a large ship.
Unless a seaman as well as an officer, (not that any one can
he a good naval officer without being a seaman) a captain
must inevitably be as awkward, and as much at a loss in the
practical command of a line of battle ship, as a field officer
on land who cannot ride. Horsemanship is not more neces-
sary to a cavalry officer, than seamanship is to a naval officer.
However informed, taught, and improved by book learning,
naval officers may be, they are aware (though unfortunately
for them, their countrymen of the land do not credit the
fact sufficiently) that seamanship is the most essential
part of their education?that it can only be learned
afloat and by practice?that it needs certain qualities of head,
eye, character, and constitution, not easily or quickly ac-
quired?but therefore proportionally valuable. Neither the
differential calculus nor dynamical study will enable an
officer to manage his ship in a gale of wind, or in action: ?he
must neither overlook nor undervalue plain duties?while
studying mathematics and philosophy.
But where the foundation is solid, much useful superstruc-
ture may be raised. And the sooner an officer, employed
in a steamer, acquires a certain knowledge of steam, the
sooner he will become enabled to stand alone, independent
of others. Without such an acquisition, he must be more
in the hands of his chief engineer than he would like to
acknowledge, even to himself: ?and however able and trust-
worthy the head of the engine department may be, it is
neither convenient nor right that the commanding officer
should depend on him alone for information respecting
the management of his department; ?in which, like any
other human being, he may become negligent, or otherwise
reprehensible.
Whether it was expedient to place engineers in the ward-
room mess, while liable to be personally and manually
at work in the engine-room, may be doubted; as they them-
selves were generally disinclined to the arrangement.


A good and zealous chief engineer must often manage his
own engine, by the exertion of his own practised arms. He
must require his subordinates to use tools and execute repairs,
with their own hands ; ?which they will not do well unless he
occasionally sets them an example. Heat and dirt are then un-
avoidable ; but while men are so engaged they may piefcr
living apart from other officers who may be apt to undervalue
such manual labour, and to depreciate those who perforin
it, however indispensably necessary and valuable. Whether
the chief engineer should mess by himself, or in the ward-
room, might be a question, were it not already decided;
but that the inspectors of machinery should be among the
ward-room officers, there can be no doubt, as their ma-
nual labour is over. In character and conduct, and informa-
tion, the chief engineers are very deserving of their present
position; but the necessary and unavoidable liability to much
manual labour, causes inconvenience.
If not already settled, their half pay is now under con-
sideration, and it is to be hoped that an improvement will
be made in their uniform. The terms stoker and stoke
hole, more correctly stoke hold, although commonly used,
seem objectionable. The Americans always say fire-man,
and fire-room. In one of our frigates, furnace-man, and
fire-room, were successfully adopted, and coal-room was
substituted for bunker.
Much encouragement and consideration should be shown
to the engine department, and every facility given for clean-
liness, ventilation, and due assistance when necessary.
We now have to consider the management of steamers
afloat?at anchor?under way?making passages?defend-
ing places ?and in action.
A steamer afloat requires, in addition to the precautions
and regulations usual on board Her Majesty s sailing ships,
that the sea cocks, engine room pumps, and (unless under
repair) every part of the engine, boilers, shaft passage, and


store rooms, should be in good order and fit for immediate
use. Unless ordered to be filled, the boilers should be quite
dry, and closed. Nothing should lie on them. No sweep-
ings or gatherings should be allowed to accumulate anywhere,
no wipings, oil, tallow, or filings?to be by possibility the
cause of, or aiding spontaneous combustion. The coal-rooms
should be well ventilated, by little slides fitted purposely,
and the temperature of the coals ascertained daily by ther-
mometers. At night, if the engine is not wanted, gratings
ought to be laid and locked down. No person should ever
be allowed in the engine room without permission. The
engines should be turned partly round every day, and the
utmost care taken to keep every part in good order, free from
any deterioration, by paint, red lead, tallow, oil, or polishing.
The slide faces should be carefully examined, and cleaned,
fiom time to time. All the cocks and valves should be
turned or moved?and, generally, every place and part of the
machinery regularly inspected.
As a general rule, no iron work should be without polish,
paint, or grease, to defend it from rust. In the lower part
of the ship, and inside the boilers, it is very difficult?in some
ships it is impossible?to prevent oxidation, or rust; the mere
changes of temperature cause such deposits of moisture
on the iron, like dew on windows and bottles. This is fre-
quently called the ?sweating? of the iron.
Ropes, chains, nets, &c., must be kept clear of the screw,
which should be moved daily (or the paddles, if they are the
motors). Some time before getting under way, the boilers
should be run up, and the fires then lighted, so that steam may
be got up gradually, (without unequally heating the boilers and
furnaces,) in ample time to warm everything thoroughly, to
have plenty of steam, and to make a few slow strokes with
the engines to prove that all is right. The fires should not
be forced, but, on the contrary, damped or put back in time,
if delayed in starting, lest the boilers should prime.
Officers of the highest ability and reputation differ as to the


proportion of power to tonnage ?of speed to be attained by
steam only. Sir Charles Napier has been of opinion that a
small power is better for a ship of war?that an engine to be
used chiefly as a? n anoeuvrer? would be the best. The highest
French authorities take a different view. As may be seen
in the ? Enquete Parlementaire? (presented by H.R.H.
Prince Albert to this Institution), French admirals say (in
other words), Let us have the highest power, the greatest
S p ee( j? an d let provisions be carried in store-ships. They
also say ?Put screw's in all the ships that are new and strong.
Build none to carry more than a hundred guns. Let no
time be lost in building at least ten ships of that class, and
providing them with engines of not less than one thousand
horses? nominal power! ?It is not indeed for me to offer an
opinion; but I may say that if I had a choice, I should
prefer the highest power, (if provided with an engine at all),
and I believe many of my brother officers are of the same way
of thinking.
When first starting, neither wheels nor screw should be
moved quickly, for, if so started, they will only churn the
water out of one place, at first; and will hardly move the
ship. Beginning slowly, speed may be increased gradually.
It is advisable always to warn the engineer of what is
intended, in time for him to manage the fires properly.
Habitual attention should be paid to firing (or stoking),
as economy of fuel, duration of furnaces and boilers, and
making steam, depend on it so much. The level of water in
the boilers is, of course, a constant object to watch. Safety
and reverse valves should be frequently examined.
Knowing how much time the engines require for being
stopped or reversed, allowance must be made, in handling
the ship, accordingly, and every pilot must be cautioned.
Some engines can be reversed, like locomotives, by a link
motion, suddenly : others-can only be slowly changed?much
too slowly for the ship?s safety.
While waiting, under way, for a short time?a few hours,
or even days?the fires are put back (checked) or banked up,


by pushing them back against the bridge of the furnace, and
throwing wetted small coal over them. The safety-valve
should be shut, as the steam will then be condensed on the
crown of the boiler, trickle down and keep up the supply;
so that the water will not become salted, as would be the
case if the valves were set open, when the boilers must be
blown off from time to time, much more frequently.
All hatchways, ports, and scuttles, should be kept open, that
the weather will allow, while steam is up. The freer current
of air to the fires, the better they will burn, and the more
steam will be generated. Every precaution should be taken,
especially at night, to prevent anything combustible being
near a heated surface: and the pumps, hoses, &c. should
always be perfectly ready.
In every ship there should be tanks, filled with water, on
the lower deck, and orlop, ready for instant use in case of fire.
One bucketful of water, at the critical moment, may save a
ship, but how seldom is it at hand.
Making passages in steamers?so as to excel other steamers
equal in qualifications?is a very nice matter, requiring a con-
siderable combination of experience, skill, and judgment.
Simply to make a passage, and one that appears to be good,
is easy enough for any indifferent person, in a superior
steamer; but to make a much better passage than that, by skill,
is the question. The shortest distance (on the globe, not on
Mercator?s chart, if a long voyage,) the prevailing winds, the
currents, and direction of usual swell will be considered, a
good offing allowed from all land, and composite courses
shaped from point to point. The points being taken from
the globe may be marked on a Mercator?s chart, and then the
lines joining them will shew the courses to be steered suc-
cessively. Having no globe at hand, the courses and distances
may be calculated, by spherical trigonometry, from point to
point, and similarly transferred to Mercator?s chart, in order
that the courses to be steered, successively, to follow the re-
quired arc of a great circle, may be known by inspection. This


accuracy is only necessary in long voyages. For short dis-
tances Mercator?s chart is sufficient.
Whether it is prudent to deviate from the best line, in order
to benefit by wind or current, or avoid either, is a matter for
judgment at the time. If blowing fresh, with much sea, a
point some distance in advance, on the desired line, may
be reached sooner by two or more boards, using sails and
steam, than by steaming directly towards it: but when the
wind is light the contrar}? would be the case.
In making a long passage, the course of a sailing vessel
should be generally adopted, and steam used only in calm or
light winds.
If steam be used continually and a direct course shaped,
doubtless a quicker passage will be made, if the fuel lasts:
but then the time necessary for replenishing that quantity of
fuel must be considered. While at sea, it is usually better,
on every account, to steam ahead while becalmed or in very
light winds ; but the less fuel is used at other times, the
better, for all reasons. As a general principle in long
voyages, such as those to Australia, or the East Indies,
frequent delays to replenish fuel consume more time, and
cause more expense, risk, and anxiety than can be com-
pensated by a few days, a very few days, shorter time actually
at sea.
In large packet steamers the expense of pay, provisions,
(passengers? tables included,) and wear, taken together,
nearly equal, if they do not exceed, that of fuel, for a day?s
full power steaming: therefore, when full of passengers, it
is a great object to gain time by burning coal, when the
wind does not give sufficient speed.
It was intended, at first, that the General Screw Company?s
ships should act on the principle of combining the properties
of good sailing ships and good steamers. It was argued (as
may be seen by the evidence taken by a Committee of the
House of Commons, in 1851,) that if sailing ships go from
England to India in seventy or eighty days?fine steamers,


not less fast under canvas, steaming through calms and light
winds, ought to beat them from ten to twenty days.
To Australia it was then proposed that they should go on
similar principles, direct to Port Phillip, with only one
cargo of fuel from St. Vincent. But they adopted a different
plan?called at several ports ?made steamers? passages ?
burned an immense quantity of coal?delayed a long while
to replenish?were very expensive, and at last, this very
month, that Company has decided to adopt the original plan.
When those screw ships began to run to the Cape,
people said it was impossible to make the passage in thirty
days, as was proposed. It has been done in twenty-eight.
To go between England and Calcutta, by the Cape of
Good Hope, in sixty sailing days, was thought totally im-
possible. It has been done in fifty-six. Mr. Brunei?s huge
iron Leviathan (680 feet long, 84 feet broad, drawing 27
feet), to be propelled by three separate engines, driving
paddles and a screw, each one independent of the other ?a
very monster of the deep?is intended to carry coals for the
whole voyage and stop nowhere: but reach Calcutta, by the
Cape of Good Hope, in a month from England.
To do this, Leviathan must steam at an average rate of at
least fifteen knots an hour.
While this is in contemplation by the designer of the suc-
cessful Great Britain, (aided as usual by Captain Claxton,)
which ten years ago was thought a chimerical structure, but
is now making the longest voyages admirably ?the Bengal, a
larger ship than the Great Britain, runs from Alexandria to
England, averaging twelve knots an hour great part of the way:
?and in a few days the Himalaya, a larger ship still, 355 feet
over all, (the Bengal being 335 ?and the Great Britain 320,)
will be launched from Mr. Mare?s yard, at Blackwall, to
compete for the championship with Napier?s Bengal, both
belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company. Mean-
while we have the Duke of Wellington?s huge bulk impelled
at the rate of ten knots an hour ?the Agamemnon, deep in


the water, with her ninety guns and all sea-stores on board,
racing with the flying Fairy at the rate of eleven knots an
hour ?the Imperieuse, in sea trim, making ten knots?the
little Banshee always ready for fifteen, and many other ships
for the nation to be proud of, coming forward as fast as due
care and finishing will admit.
Not only are these ships admirable in appearance as well
as in performance, but they are as strong as wood, and iron,
and copper can make them. It is not so with our neighbour?s
most lauded production, the Napoleon. That ship is said to
be already shaken seriously by her engines, and the machi-
nery itself almost ruined, because originally too slightly
constructed.
DEFENCE.
For defending our own coasts it must be kept in view that
large ships can only act at a distance from the land, on account
of their great draft of water, nearly five fathoms, and can only
leave or enter our principal ports at high water.
It should also be remembered that we have numerous
ready-made batteries in our guardships and ships in ordinary,
which may be soon towed to and moored in commanding
positions; and that every sailing ship of war may be made
almost as efficient as a steamer, by attaching a good tug-boat
to her as a tender.
Whether, instead of one or two of our immense three-deck-
ers, costing about two hundred thousand pounds each, besides
the pay and maintenance of the thousand souls on board, it
might be advisable to have two or three hundred steam gun
boats, which could be built, equipped, and maintained for the
same money?is a question for the Authorities.
One well placed shell might disable a three-decker, with all
her immense force. That shell may be fired from a gun boat.
The disproportion between the risk and damage to which each
is liable is enormous. Suppose that an enemy?s flotilla ap-


preached any part of our shores?only steam gun-boats could
act promptly, in comparatively shallow water, against a flotilla
of boats carrying troops. Such engines as Mr. Rennie?s Disc
would suit them excellently well. Each might have one
good, heavy, long gun?and the whole number might be
stationed in squadrons, at sheltered places around the coast,
wherever a landing might be effected.
High authorities think that our war ships are too large?
that, considering the effects of even one shell, there is
too much at stake in a single ship?that we ought to build no
ships so large even as the Agamemnon. The French have
already approached this conclusion, it would appear, by having
stated in the Report of their Enquete Parlementaire, that
it is not advisable to construct any ships to carry more than
a hundred guns. On the other hand, some of our best
officers say that we must have the largest ships, and that
whatever other nations build, we must exceed; because
large ships have a prestige that tells heavily, in addition
to their weight of metal.
It is a difficult and important question?not perhaps to be
viewed exactly in the same light as before the introduction
of steam ?and shells fired horizontally.
TACTICS.
Naval tactics will undoubtedly be much altered in consequence
of the prevalence of these additions to hostile armaments.
That the majority of effective line-of-battle ships will have
screws, seems more than probable, as the French Commission
has reported in favour of fitting every ship with a screw that
is strong enough to bear one: and our Admiralty has taken
steps to be quite on an equality.
A general action, some years hence, may probably be
between steamers only; but, at present, and for a few years,
a fleet or squadron will be composed of steamers and ordinary
sailing vessels.


No doubt flag-officers and those who may expect to hoist
their flags in active service, have thought much about the
disposition of such mixed and differing forces?of the
arrangements to be made ?and the tactics to be adopted.
But no recently written treatise on naval tactics is acces-
sible. Works published before steam came into use afloat
are now of little practical value ; even our Signal books, the
only official instructions on this subject, require much alter-
ation. The whole system of manoeuvring a fleet must be
more or less modified to suit existing circumstances, and to
turn them to the best account.
Perhaps it is less inconvenient for an inexperienced junior
officer to attempt a discussion of this question, than it
would be for an officer of experience and reputation. The
mistakes of the former will be of less consequence : there-
fore, under this impression?l will venture to offer a few
ideas.
In the navies of England, France, and Russia, the only
Powers possessing fleets, there are now (as is well known)
many large steamers ?line of battle ships, as well as frigates,
and there will soon be many more.
In the event of war, the fleets of these great maritime
Powers will be called into activity. How will they be com-
posed ? In what order will they sail ? How will they form
for action ? In what manner will a general action be com-
menced ?and how will it be carried on ?
First ? as to the composition of the English fleet. Sup-
posing that half of our line of battle ships are screws, and
the rest without steam ?it is obvious that the whole must
be put as nearly on an equality as possible, as to speed and
manoeuvring, or ?if it does not adhere to the maxim of
regulating movements by the slowest ships ?the fleet will
become divided. This equality may be effected by attach-
ing to each ship (without an engine) a handy and powerful
towing steamer, as a tender, under the immediate and entire
control of the ship to which she is attached. Supposing this


A veteran officer, well known to both professions of arms,
(who has had much experience of hard fighting) observed,
not long ago ?? that more nerve and self possession would
be wanted in the next war than were required in the last;? ?
steam and shells having added such elements of destruction.
Now, if one may say so without undue national pride, it is
in these very qualities of cool courage and self-possession,
that the British Islanders excel. And as war requires two
parties to play its deadly game, it does appear that the more
formidable, and the more complicated, the weapons used,
the greater will be our own advantages ?if we do not throw
them away.
Supposing hostile fleets in sight of each other in open
ocean; manoeuvring will probably take place, with two objects,
namely ?disabling, by good gunnery, a part of the enemy s
fleet, and guarding our own from a similar calamity. Pro-
bably little or no sail will be set on board steamers, the prin-
cipal canvas will be clewed up, though kept ready for setting,
and thoroughly wetted. It seems likely that sailing ships
will be ordered against similar ships, rather than steamers,
and that their tenders will aid them as much as possible,
keeping, while they can, on the side of their ship which is
not engaged. Concentrating efforts against a portion of the
enemy, bringing overwhelming force to bear upon a part only
of his line, will doubtless be a main principle of attack?as
it has been hitherto with the best admirals, as well as generals.
While exercising the valuable gunnery skill, acquired during
many years of careful practice ?the direction of wind, the
drift of smoke, will be of much consequence; and though
steam almost does away with the comparative values of wea-
ther or lee gages, the quantity and drift of smoke must be
considered, with the double object of seeing the enemy, and
being covered from his sight.
Some officers think that the sooner our ships close, and
board the enemy, the greater will be our advantage. Some
say that actions at sea will in future have a resemblance
to the encounters of Roman galleys, and that we shall have


ships with sharp iron prows, for running into and disabling
our opponents. Were such a course of action approved
generally, by the most competent authorities, another
description of vessel ?between Nasmyth?s f< coast defender,
and a gigantic war galley ?might be more suitable than a
three-decker. But be this as it may ?there can be little or no
doubt that we shall not often again be permitted to approach
and take up positions almost uninjured, as was the case at
the Nile ?at Copenhagen ?Trafalgar ?Algiers ?and Nava-
rino. Difficult as it may be to refrain from immediately
closing with the enemy, a reasonable interval of gunnery
practice will afford time for a few accidents, and explosions,
which may be anticipated on board the enemy s ships; and
will allow the steady enduring qualities of our countrymen
to gain their w?onted advantage over those of too eager and
more easily excited opponents.
It is to be presumed that the attacked portion of a fleet
will be speedily supported by the remainder, unless that
part be promptly met and disabled by- ships not yet en-
gaged, Steam power affords great facilities for manoeuvring
ships, or squadrons, (almost like brigades of land forces,)
but, at the same time, officers and men must be prepared
to meet, and not be astonished by greater disasters than
have ever yet happened; ?disasters proportioned to such
augmented powers of injury.
Great ships have been burned, have foundered, or have
been blown up in former actions : but steam and shells
have immensely added to the means by which catastro-
phes will in future be caused when hostile fleets encounter.
While duly mindful of the Omnipotent Disposer of
all things?w r e may, however, rest in confidence, that with
an Army and Navy duly appreciated by those ? who live at
home at ease,? ?? Britannia safely will retain ?her Empire
of the seas.?
