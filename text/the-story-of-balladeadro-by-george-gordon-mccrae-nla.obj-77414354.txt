R. H. HORNE, ESQ.,
STORY OF BALLADEADRO
IS INSCRIBED
WITH MUCH RESPECT,
WITH EVERY MARK OF ADMIRATION AND ESTEEM,
HIS OBLIGED AND VERY OBEDIENT SERVANT,
THE AUTHOR.
Melbourne, January, 1867,


PREFACE.
-*?
The story of ? Balladeddrd" is founded on a tradition once
current among the aborigines of our weflern tribes, the MS.
notes of which, as taken down by the wife of a former Protector
of Aborigines, came into my hands many years ago.
It is evident to me, after repeated and careful perusal of the
lady?s papers, that the story (which is very gracefully told) has
received little, if any, colouring at the hands of the transcriber.
As regards the ? black ?or magic art practised by the doctors
of the tribes, her information agrees fully with my own
personal experience.
I have been present on two occasions when the wizard was
engaged in charming, or rather in attempting to charm away,
the lives of certain persons of other and diflant tribes.
The ceremony observed was precisely similar to that which 1
have described in ?Palladeddro.?
An outline sketch of the intended victim was engraved on the
shuttle-shaped body of a spear-refl or ? throwing-stickf* a lock
of the doomed one?s hair was suspended from the upper extremity,
and the lower or handle-end 7oas wrapped in twifled grass, in
order to prevent any injury to the fingers of the wizard from the
poisonous unguents with which the picture was smeared.
* A shield may be used for the same purpose.


These preparations being complete, the spear-rejl was stuck
upright in the ground, and very close to the wizard's fire. As
the heat caused the poisoned ointment to sink into the wood, he
was at hand to renew it, singing the while; and as the poison
dried and the image grew hot, he told me that the intended
victim at a difiance was suffering the mofi terrible agonies.
Sometimes, wearied out with watching and incantation, the
wizard leaves the stick to fate, and goes to sleep. If, on
awaking, he finds that it has toppled over into the fire, he
takes it for granted that the object of his hate is no more.
I remember, in one of those infiances which I have quoted,
this accident happened, but the victim singled out (a young
woman some forty miles difiant at the time) was none the
worse in consequence.
The wizard said that there mufi have been something wrong
with the picture or the poison, or perhaps something deficient in
the incantation itself, but nothing could shake his firfi principles
of ? obeism
? Balladeddro ? (I would wish to add), befides exhibiting
the superflitions and ceremonies of a rapidly-disappearing race,
makes us aware of a patriotism or love of country obtaining
largely among a people hitherto supposed to be incapable of
such a sentiment, and, added to this, the possession of natural
affection and the finer feelings which most writers deny them.
G. G. M?C.


THE
STORY OF BALLADEADRO,
THE CAMP.
The sun had set, and deepening shades
Clothed all the bosky glens and glades,
The hill, the lake, the treeless plain,
The high and rugged mountain chain.
Far o?er the forest tops were traced
Blue smoke-wreaths curling from the waste,
Which, feebly struggling through the air,
?Tween giant stems and branches bare,
Slow from the camp-fires rose on high,
Like incense, to the darkling sky.
Here sloped the low grey roofs of bark,
The spoil of sylvan monarch stark,
Whose boughs of tenderest leaf made bowers
Where dark skins whiled away the hours
With song or tale of wondrous feat
Achieved by brave, or huntsman fleet;
And spears in order stood around,
Guarding the tribe?s green camping-ground.


THE DREAMERS.
?Tis night. Secure all lie at rest ?
The babe upon its mother?s breast;
The mother laughing in her sleep,
To see her firstling infant leap,
Or join the sport and hunting chase
With all the spirit of his race.
The warrior there, with shifting smile
Dreamt of the chase, the dark defile,
The ambush ?neath the lichen?d rock,
The stout repulse of onslaught shock !
Saw in his mind the quivering spear
Writhe onward through the yielding air,
And heard the sharp resounding cracks
Of club or native battle-axe ;
Tracked out the trail with stealthy tread,
With balanced arm and bended head :
And dreaming thus passed night away,
Till fancy fled with morn?s'first ray.
Meanwhile, the hunters and their hounds,
Tired with their long and weary rounds,
Lay stretched at length before the fires,
Deep slumbering ?mid their sons and sires,
One dog, a dreamer like the rest,
In fancy hard his quarry pressed,
And as he near and nearer drew
He barked ?then rose a wild halloo.
The hunter, dreaming, heard the hound,
Hallooed, and rose with sudden bound ;
And all the dogs, awaking straight,
Bayed the red sun above the gate :
For morn had closed with glowing bars
The portal that shut out the stars.


He smiled. They blended into night,
And all was day, and day was bright.
Two tribes had slept, and twain arose?
Friends, ?mid surrounding tribes of foes;
Embracing sprang to run their race,
Allied in love, and war, and chase;
? Joined ever,? sang the camp-fire songs,
? Mirbangos and brave Darakongs.?
The maidens tossed night?s dewy pearls
From brows o?erhung with ebon curls,
And gathering in each jetty tress
Arranged anew its loveliness.
Remote sate scarred and seamed braves,
Tracing the war-paint?s ruddy waves
Adown and up each stalwart arm,
To add to symmetry a charm.
Tall plumes they place, as taste commands.
In all their ochred forehead bands;
These, and long teeth in serried row,
A
Alternate with the elf-locks flow ;
And reeds in jointed order deck
The yellow coil that clasps each neck.
Waxed grave the men, as all obey
The grey-beard sage, whose silent sway
Beckoned each follower fierce and fleet
To take at council fire his seat.
THE COUNCIL FIRE,
?Twould tire to tell of every face
That round the council fire had place ;
Of every sage, whose brows of white
Seemed ashes strewed o?er embers bright;-


Whose jutting breast and shoulders scarred
The tattoo-marking scarcely marred :
And whose tough arms of sinewy strength
Were waved in eloquence, full length.
?Twere long, but would ?twere mine to tell
How silence caught the words that fell;
Or how at length, with placid face,
Each sate him down with savage grace.
Beamed bright the eyes to beauty born,
As eyes met eyes that flashed in scorn,
And hand with gestured action spoke
To arm that waved a speaking stroke.
Anon, as conscious of some fate
Impending o?er their twin-born state,
Were voices heard whose earnest tones
Urged fathers? graves and fathers? bones,
And stirred to boiling all their blood,
Now risen from lazy ebb to flood.
KOLORKOR (Hot Blood).
Kolorkor rose?Mirbango?s king?
And thus address?d the listening ring :
? Sires ! Warriors ! Children ! Hearken well
To all your king has come to tell.
Our fathers? spirits, ill at rest,
Flit nightly o?er the mountain?s breast;
Yon stream is troubled, and the flood
?Neath last night?s moon seem?d curdling blood
Birds of ill omen croaked on high,
The eagle swooning fled the sky.
Oh, would the oracles withheld
The meaning sought by seers of eld
Strange portents dire of varied mien
Presage such ill as ne?er hath been.


Last night there crept athwart my frame
A shuddering sense of woe and shame;
Something?oh, would it were forgot?
Tis day, and yet it leaves me not,
I sprang from out the evil dream,
And saw?extended through the beam
The red moon cast upon the coals,
Consuming slow their burning souls?
Two giant hands ?one dark as night,
The other ? stained with blood ? was white
Opposed as ?twere in equal strife,
And nerved to struggle for the life.
The dark hand hovered o?er my head,
And all my trembling fears lay dead,
When sudden came within my clasp
The spear you now behold me grasp.
I poised the reed ; but ere I hurled,
The white hand vanished from the world ;
And I, without the slumbering camp,
Shook from my brow big drops of damp.
Then, as morn?s blossom burst the bud,
I saw ?O horror ! ?gouts of blood ?
Blood on my hands, and woman?s hair,
Blood fastened to my trusty spear.?
He sate, and seemed beside the fire
Some victim of supernal ire ;
But ghostly terror had not quenched
His soul, nor yet his visage blenched.
WADARO.
Wadaro rose, ? of rugged face,?
Chief of the tall Darakong race ;
And gathering on his arm his cloak,
To King Kolorkor fiercely spoke


? You marked, Kolorkor, ere was hurled
The spear sent from the spirit world,
The hand had vanish?d ; but the blood?
?Twas ours??twill surely swell the flood
That yet must with its darkening stain
Our greenest forest glades engrain.
Pour, mingled tide, thy kindred flood,
Darakong and Mirbango blood !
Join the hot flow, red Tapook rill !
And drink, war demon, drink thy fill!
Haste, twin-born tribes ! ?yon king and I
Across the hills must swiftly fly;
And o?er our heads the darker hand
Shall point the way to Tapook land.
We?ll send the war-sign through their camp,
And flat their turf with dancing tramp.
Speed thee, Ganook, with these swift spears?
This fire-brand weeping fiery tears ;
And take this quandang?s double plum,
?Twill speak alliance tho? ?tis dumb.
GANOOK (or the Swift Messenger).
The Ganook danced o?er hill and plain,
Ascending toiled, ? ran down like rain,?
Nor paused till at the Tapook?s feet
He laid the brand a-glow with heat.
So swept across yon purple plains,
At night o?erspread with starry chains,
Karakorok,* the sacred crow,
* KARAKOROK, according to aboriginal tradition, was a gigantic
crow, who befriended the human family shortly after the creation.
Pitying their cold and fireless condition, he flew to the sun and
snatched a brand from the hearth; this he brought ?blazing in his
bill ?to the world below. Karakorok was finally translated to the
skies, and became a constellation (Orion).


That first brought fire to realms below,
And carried blazing in his bill
The brand that lights our camp-fires still.
THE TAPOOK?S RECEPTION OF THE
MESSENGER.
The lazy Tapook raised his head,
Regarding as he gazed the red*
Whose warlike flush suffused each limb,
That flamed like fiery Seraphim ;
The tinge of war, the tinct of blood,
Figured the tide of ruby flood,
And called as loud as symbol might
For helping hand in heady fight.
Alas! ere this the white man?s dole
Had bought the slavish Tapook?s soul,
Who lost the dotted plains that spread
From Wando?s mouth to fountain-head ?
From those stern crags whence springs Matar
To ocean?s tumbling waves afar,
Which, lost in distance, sun, and spray,
Melt mist-like into heaven away !
The pale-face brought his bartering bread,
The Tapook gave him land instead ;
Green hills, and hunting grounds, and vales,
Lakes virgin yet from ships and sails,
Were his for robing, raiment, food,
And axe of steel that felled the wood.
The faithful harbinger fell back,
But King Kolorkor on the track
Not far behind, with flaming brand
And polished lance in either hand,
* War paint.


Came stalking tow?rds the royal Tapook,
As erst the swift but mute Ganook :
? Tried ally (he began) of ours,
?Mid crash of clubs and spear-shaft showers?
Our stout and brave would join thy bold,
And mass their ranks on this green wold.
See ! stout Wadaro?s warriors near,
Me and my brave Mirbangos here,
Be?t thine to lead thy stalwart clan?
A thousand, numbered man for man.?
To him the Tapook, turning, sighed,
And with but half his soul replied?
? What need of all these marshall?d ranks ?
Our nation owes the stranger thanks.
Our food, our shelter is prepared,
His very blanket-robes are shared
With us; and as for roots, instead
He sows broadcast among us bread.
But tarry, brother king, a while,
And rest, for many a weary mile
Hath plucked the sinews from thy heel,
And stiffened all thy nerves of steel.?
THE TARRYING IN THE TAPOOK?S LAND,
Moons waned, and suns successive steered
Their course tow?rd west horizon weird,
Yet no alliance made nor plann?d
Against the white aggressive hand.
No warriors fought?the sport and hunt
Made all their battle weapons blunt;
And each returning from the chase,
With slower and spoil-burdened pace,
Cast longing eyes on Tapook maids,
That lay beneath the lengthening shades;


And many a brave transgressed the rule*
Framed in their twin-blood-allied school,
And, mating with the maid he chose,
Sought her green roof to find repose.
Kolorkor, one of these the first,
A fiercely-burning passion nurst; ?
Balladeadrot fired his brain?
Balladeadro with a chain
Unconscious bound his bursting heart,
And barred his wishes to depart.
KOLORKOR?S WOOING.
To her it seemed an easy thing?
Herself the daughter of a king?
To dally with Tangola?s guest;
But when his suit with warmth he pressed,
She turned her laughing face away,
Heedless of all his love could say.
Then would Kolorkor?s anger rise,
And flash like lightning from his eyes ;
But, past the pang of wounded pride,
He sate him silent by her side,
Like some huge thunder-cloud expended,
The calmer when the storm is ended.
?Twas thus for days and afternoons,
For many waxing, waning moons,
Half-trusted hope his only wage,
Neglect still spurred him on to rage ;
And so the monarch?s wooing sped,
With giddy brain and heart like lead.
* The Mirbangos and Darakongs were forbidden to intermarry with
other tribes.

WADARO?S COUNSEL.
One day it chanced, in pensive mood,
He sought Wadaro in the wood;
And finding him, his counsel sought
With heart, and brain, and soul distraught.
? Kolorkor !? thundered forth the King,
? You make yourself a little thing;
And me, your friend, a thing still less,
In counsel grave on nothingness.
Remember, who our tribes would rule
Can never mate him with a fool!
Are not our maidens fair as they ?
And formed from quite as pure a clay ?
Their eyes, their hair, their winning looks
Are more than match for these Tapooks.
Besides, our wise ancestral laws
Bid all our manlier ones to pause
Ere stepping o?er the sacred bounds
That mark our ancient hunting grounds ;
And seek, amid our virgins fair,
The solace sent to soothe our care.?
To him Kolorkor thus replied,
In phrase that reason?s front defied ;
? Wadaro ! What I?ve said, I?ve said ;
The rest ?be that upon my head !?
* * * *
Time with his train rolled on, and all
That paved the way towards his fall;
His warrior ways were all forgot
His weapons now he heeded not.
Laid by some reedy river?s brink,
Musing, he?d watch the bell-bird drink ;


Thence rising, pace the pebbly marge,
Till dying day had dropped his targe,
And sinking, with his latest blood
He reddened all the trembling flood;
Till night drew near and closed his eye,
And spread her mantle tenderly
Across his darkening rayless face,
And hid him in his resting-place,
Whilst wind-waved reeds his requiem sighed,
In wailing accents o?er the tide.
* * *
Time?s waters rolled towards the sea
(Dim ocean of eternity),
And hurried with the current all
That presaged proud Kolorkor?s fall;
Each pebble bandied by the stream,
That caught betimes a golden gleam,
Seem?d some event by prescience willed?
Some ancient prophecy fulfilled.
Straight through his breast a sadness crept,
And as he mused Kolorkor wept;
He saw in every sinking targe,
That lit the river?s shimmering marge,
The funeral of his hopes and fears ?
The grave of unrewarded years.
TANGO LA?S REFUSAL.
At sunset sad, at dawning wild,
His brain with failing plans he piled,
Till, tired with unavailing care,
He sought the father of the fair ?
Sought him, who sold his birth-right land,
And sued him for his daughter?s hand.


He paused?Tangola silence broke,
And to the suitor thus he spoke :
? Seest thou above, with silvery sheen,
The evening star, pale MIRGABEEN ? *
She looks with saddening eye tow?rds earth,
Which holds the secret of her birth.
Coulds?t thou from Heav?n pluck out yon star
That shines upon us from afar,
And lay her in her beauty?s pride
Between me and my own fire-side ?
I?d not yield up my daughter fair,
With flashing eyes and raven hair.
And know, proud King, that threats are vain-
Tho? spears should fall like summer rain,
Deem not Balladeadro?s sire
Yet wanting all his ancient fire.
Up ! go thy ways, ? Hot-blooded ? chief,
And seek at other hands relief.
Go ?-get some mild Mirbango mate
To rear an heir to rule thy state;
As for Balladeadro rare,
No stranger may that jewel wear ;
A father?s joy, a camp-fire?s pride,
To alien ne?er can be allied.?
MURDER OF TANGOLA.
Short time for parley now remained.
The madden?d chief his feet regained ;
Fierce hate from both his eyeballs gleamed,
A fiend in all his wrath he seemed.
? Take this ! ? he hissed, and raising high
The spear to his unerring eye,
* ? Mirgabeen,? a young woman of great beauty, who was
formed into a star.


He hurled, and all his muscles shook
As pierced his lance the tall Tapook ;
Who, bowing sudden to his fate,
Fell forward on his grizzled pate.
No time was lost ?as quick as thought
The virgin to his arms he caught;
Then dragged her to Trelinnay?s bower,
And charged him with the new-pluckt flower,
Fit gaoler! less of man than creature,
And hard as flint in face and feature.
BALLADEADRO IN CAPTIVITY.
There flitted o?er the luckless maid
Th? uncertain wav?ring dappled shade,
As toyed the breeze with every flower
And leaf that decked the captives? bower.
With sad tho? joyous-seeming face,
And artless art dissembling grace,
She wrought in silence blues with greens,
And scarlets in her gilburneens ;*
Thus would she sit, and work, and muse,
From morning?s dawn till evening dews,
While, singing ever by her side,
Sat grim Trelinnay?s ancient bride.
She weaved, and weaving trolled her song,
Sang on and weaved the rushes long,
And cast at times a furtive glance
From eyes that pierced like pointed lance ;
Outwards and tow?rds where stranger?s tread
Was heard, she?d raise her grisly head.
* Feather girdles worn in the dances.


O, tyrant sex! to thine the same
Neath tropic sunbeam?s burning flame,
As where the arctic ice and snow
Baulk the swift river in its flow.
Give ye to guard a sister charge,
And say : ?Who?ll overstep the marge.
MORA-MORA
(SURNAMED THE ? GANOOK,? OR SWIFT MESSENGER.)
Hard by the bower that held the maid,
Beneath the same dark forest?s shade,
Through which the slanting sunbeam shot,
Stood Mora-mora?s sylvan cot.
This youth, whose skill with axe of stone
Had made his father?s badge his own,
Sate there amid his hunting gear,
Repairing broken net and spear.
Oft passing westward to the chase,
The captive maiden?s sadden?d face
Would haunt the hunter as he walked,
And trip him while his game he stalked.
His hand had lost (so many deemed)
Its cunning since those eyes had beamed
Their first bright rays into his own,
And taught him that he dwelt alone.
Henceforth, with throbbing heart on fire,
Possession was his sole desire ;
And if love?s eyes a language speak
The same to Roman, Celt, or Greek ?
The same in France or sunny Spain,
On Tartar steppes or Afric?s plain?


Such flashed from captive maid to man,
And thus their burning loves began.
But still the King, with stately tread,
And heron feathers in his head,
Approached at noon with presents rare,
To woo his drooping prisoner fair.
Kind his entreaty ?half-forlorn ?
His only meed was smiling scorn.
Thus hours of unavailing praise,
With prayers, made up the sum of days,
And still nor hope nor joy beguiled
The suitor of the orphan?d child.
She, when her tongue the silence broke,
These burning words in anguish spoke :
? Strike, murd?rer, home ! she fears no pain
Whose father throbs in every vein !
What! crouched at thy false feet to lie
Thy wife ! ?thy prisoner first she?d die !
Avaunt! begone ! away, away?
With words that lie, and hands that slay.?
Kolorkor?s brow a cloud o?ercast,
His breath was coming ? thick and fast,?
And fanned his anger-burning cheek,
As thus the chief essayed to speak.
KOLORKOR?S THREAT.
? Not by this spear, that lately stood
A sapling in Tor?s sacred wood,
But by the keener point unseen
Of shaft whose bark ne?er budded green,
Hurled by the might of wizard spell,
With force resistless, fierce and fell?


Mine now the lock you lost when fright
Had mastered all your senses quite.
Tis mine ! but Kolpo?s be the charge
To weave the spell, and grave the targe;
To symbol forth those pliant limbs,
Depict each orb in tears that swims ;
And trace the darkly flowing hair,
Forced gage to passion from despair !
Such be his ploy at dead of night,
When the fair figure, fixed upright,
Shall fade and wither ?fore the fire,
While Kolpo sings Kolorkor?s ire;
And in the weird night-air shall wave
Thy hair from poison-dripping stave.
Nor dream, fond maid, of hope, escape,
Nor aid nor help in any shape.
Kolorkor swears ! His heart is steeled !
And Thou, thine awful doom is sealed.
Pity?forgiveness?hence ! ?Remorse,
Farewell ! ?Until thy withered corse
Shall rot upon the arid plain,
And whiten in the sun and rain.
There never shall the Raven stoop,
With shifting eye and quivering swoop;
The birds, the very beasts of prey,
Awestruck, shall shivering turn away;
And grass beneath, and leaves above,
Shall wither with Kolorkor?s love.?
He turned, and turning, swiftly fled
Into the gloom the forest shed,
Nor paused till well beneath the roof
Whence all the tribe most held aloof,
And sought the ghoul whose peering eye
Seemed tracing out some mystery.


INCANTATION OF KOLPO THE WIZARD
Within the wood, by weird-fire light,
The wizard plied his art at night;
And sitting with his palms outspread,
And palsied, forward-bending head,
Sang to the flames a dreamy stave,
That sounded like a half-spent wave.
? Lambent tongues of sacred fire,
That own the burning sun as sire ;
And thou, O Sun ! whose kindling ray
Drives forth the night?begets the day ;
Whose red and ever-glowing hearth,
Plunder?d for shivering suns of earth,
Conceived the heat that warms our hands
With blazing heav?n enravish?d brands, ?
Assist our spell?our incantation,
Nor heed a lover?s lamentation.
Bat and bird,
Lizard, owl,
Crow and snake
With hooded cowl,
Cast with me malignant eyes
On Kolpo?s symboll?d sacrifice ;
Circle, flit about the flames ;
Fan the fire that aids our aims.
Night-jar, owl, and fluttering bat,
Sail ye round and round. That fat
Came from a warrior?s cloven side,
Grim trophy of a victor?s pride ;
This, and poison from the snake*
With juice of deadly herb, I take*


And, breathing wizard?s withering curse,
Anoint the targe and work for worse.
Eat her,* ? Pudgill ? ?gnaw her frame ;
Burn her, leprous tongues of flame;
Wrinkle all of her that?s round,
Nor leave a single sinew sound ;
So shall each supple limb give way,
And shrink into a shrivelled spray ;
So shall dull death, by slow degrees,
Her heart?s swift bounding current freeze.
Blast the twin blossoms of her breast;
Burn and gnaw??tis our behest.
Quench yon two stars ?our sacrifice
Demands the light of beauty?s eyes.?
* * *. 'X- *
?Twas thus the palsied wizard sang
As Mora-Mora on him sprang.
All that long night he?d watched the ghoul
The lizard, bat, and large-eyed owl;
Had seen the raven fan the flame
That flickered, leapt, and went and came ;
Had marked, with swift-increasing ire,
The loathsome hell-craft by the fire.
No longer to be held, he swung
His club aloft; it hissed and sung,
As, falling on the wizard?s pate,
It turned the wavering scale of fate.
THE BROKEN SPELL.
Thus the destroying Kolpo fell,
As all the camp traditions tell;
* A wasting disease;


And Mora-Mora stooped to stretch
Across the quivering prostrate wretch.
And snatched, with all a lover?s care,
The streaming lock ?the maiden?s hair ;
O?erturned the targe and quenched the fire,
And ?venged the maid, tho? not the sire.
RETURN, AND THE FULL-MOON DANCE,
To gain the camp, one day and night
He westward sped on limbs of might;
And found the tribes, with spear and lance,
Preparing for the ? full-moon? dance ;
And tho? half-weary from the race,
He painted o?er his anxious face,
And joined the dancing, joyous throng.
With mazy tread and sounding song
The crowd advanced, the crowd retired,
In martial rank, by music fired ;
Anon sank softly, as the strain,
Subsiding like the slumb?rous main,
Which, murmuring gently on the beach,
Breathes to the sky its failing speech.
THE TIDINGS OF REVENGE,
When all was still?and man and maid,
Well wearied, wandered through the-glade,
Or sought the hut and warm fireside,
To rest awhile in painted pride ?
Then Mora-Mora found the cot,
Seeming as tho? he sought it not;
The one that held his maiden?s charms,
All trembling there with love?s alarms ;


And clasping her with wild embrace,
He kissed the big tears from her face.
Short were their whisper?d words and few,
Beneath the bower-leaves wet with dew.
Swift he restored the ravish?d lock,
And ?gan the wizard?s art to mock;
? Our tribe, my girl! will arm anon,
And thou must all thy bravery don,
To fly with me when all is won,
Or see me die ere next the sun
Shall crown yon mountain?s sombre brow,
And seal or loose our plighted vow.?
THE BATTLE BY MOONLIGHT.
The song waxed loud?the dancers flew,
As Mora-Mora backwards drew,
Stealing towards the rocky ledge
That fenced the towering plateau?s edge
Thence beckoning to his trusty clan,
He posted warriors man by man.
? I go/? he cried, ? to join the King,
But when you hear my war-club ring
Against his shield, rush every man
Into the battle?s bristling van,
And where you note the curlew?s cry
Press forward to the fray !??tis I! ?
* * * *
The shield was struck ! The King, amazed,
Upon the painted stripling gazed ;
Then rushed upon him with the spear,
But found the foe devoid of fear;
Raised his stout arm, and thundered ? Die ! ?
When rose to heav?n the curlew?s cry,


And braves in masses forward press?d
With levelled spear and fluttering crest;
And lo ! aloft, a giant arm,
Whose mailed might with starry charm
Was studded o?er at every joint,
That blazed with many a rivet point.
It held the Moon ! a silver shield,
Outstretched above their battle-field,
And legioned stars in bright array
Seem?d waiting for the coming fray ;
Thence glanced the star-shaft launched in vain,
Thence it reeled wildering o?er the plain,
As point from boss was harmless turned,
And death impending swiftly spurned.
* * * * *
The Heavens knelled back the shouts and cries
Of warriors in their agonies ;
And through the stardit blue vault rang
The din of arms ?the battle clang.
Host forth to host defiance hurled,
As the stern conflict shook the world ;
The hissing spears sped on like levin,
Obscuring in their flight the heaven ;
While circling thro? the air there sang
The swift careering boomerang.
THE DEATH OF MORA-MORA.
The victors left the mangled dead
Unburied, as they onward sped
To gain ere earliest matin ray
The track that marked their homeward way.
But ere the braves had cleared the wood,
Or made their victor-footing good,


The King stole round and blocked the pass,
Where, hid behind the tufted grass,
He rallied soon a faithful few
To charge the foe that rose to view.
Onward in warlike rank they came,
With arms and limbs of symbolled flame ;
But, ah ! too soon that marching throng,
Disordered, changed their triumph song
To one of wailing, woe, and grief,
When, spear-transfixed, their gallant chief
Fell to the turf with heavy sound,
And all his blood bedewed the ground.
DEATH OF BALLADE AD RO.
Kolorkor?s vengeance nigh complete,
He hurled again, and at the feet
Of bleeding Mora-Mora fell
The maiden both had loved so well.
The shaft he urged, by fury prest,
Had pierced the virgin?s yielding breast;
There the reed, blood-stained, trembling hung,
As died these last words on her tongue :
? Alas ! I die ! and well ?tis so,
Since blood and love commingled flow !
Smile, Father ! on this marriage-bed,
And bless the pair that death has wed.
Ah ! happier thus by spearman?s point
To fall, than wither root and joint,
A victim to the Wizard?s spell?
Insidious, cruel, dark, and fell!?
* � *
She folded in her last embrace
Her Lord, and laid her dying face


Against his cheek, with eyes upcast;
And thus two loving spirits passed.
She fell! Another spear in rest
Wrought the avenger?s stern behest;
But whether this were deed of chance,
Or of some destined, chosen lance,
None knows, or no one cares to tell,
Save that the proud Kolorkor fell.
This much is known : ?Tis breath?d by night,
By many a dying camp-fire?s light?
By watchers as they while away
The hours that usher in the day,
Or tell the children round the fires ?
How trembled once their stalwart sires
To find no kingly corpse next day
Among the common warrior clay.
How from on high a bleeding owl,
With glaring eyes and snowy cowl,
Gazed on that field with fixed despair,
Shrieked, and so vanished into air !
But when the child makes bold to ask
Some crone the mystery to unmask,
She only answers ?? Trim the fire,?
Or, ? Pile the sticks a little higher,?
And ? Cuddle closer while we sing
A story of some other King.?
BURIAL CHANT.
Some sought amid the bleeding dead
The pair that only death could wed.


Maruka, stooping, first espied
The murdered lovers, side by side;
Then, beckoning silence to the band
With outstretched deprecating hand,
Began, with saddened voice, to raise
The death-song called the ? End of Days
THE END OF DAYS.
? Tall Tomboritha?s summit cleft
Opens a blue door thro? the snow,
Thence pass the souls that friends bereft
Must mourn with bitter tears below.
Kowayika !* maidens, wail!
Answer back both hill and dale.
Kowayika ! swell the gale
With sighs o?er joy departed ;
Tomboritha ! flash the strain
From crag and peak to earth again ;
Earth ! send it o?er the azure plain,
To souls from bodies parted.
And ye, O spirits of the dead !
That once for love or glory bled,
Behold the big bright tears we shed.
Ah ! Wah ! ?Kowayika!
Kowayika ! Waft the strain
From sky to earth and back again;
Then o?er the sea, in tear-like rain,
Let grief melt?Kowayika !?
* * *
Advancing slow, four spearmen brave
Bore the two bodies to one grave,
? Kowayika??Woe?s me !?Alas !


Where the sad silent tribe attended
Like statues till the rites were ended;
Then Maruka, whom sorrow bent,
Raised with the maids this long lament.
LAMENT (for Balladeadro).
Mourn, maidens, darkened for ever
The sun of a joyous life,
To rise again gladly never!
Swiftly snatched away in strife.
The fairest was she of the daughters
That Klyony bore to the king,
In her warm nest beside the dark waters ?
Wail, maidens, and mournfully sing.
The tallest, the rarest, the brightest,
The sunshine that gladdened our eyes;
Whose music made hearts bound the lightest,
Or filled every bosom with sighs.
Dashed down like the spray from a fountain,
Fled like thistle-plume chased by the wind;
Hidden as mist hides the mountain,
Since earth veils the eyes that are blind.
Wail, winds, that once wafted the whisper
Of love to her wakening soul!
And mourn as you wofully lisp her
Sad name where the blue billows roll'?
Where the brook rushes down to the river?
Where the river-pulse throbs thro? the plain;
Where the tide with an answering quiver
Bounds up from the heart of the main ;
By the margin of streams in the uplands,
Where the wild flowers creep down the brink'


Where the shells of green pearl ?mid the gold sands
Seem gems where the sun-rays sink ;
By the skirts of the dark grey forest,
The paths in the grassy glades?
Wail the loudest, the saddest, the sorest.
Oh ! weeping and sorrowing maids !
No more to the forest or fountain
Comes the fair with the tiny feet ;
No more over moorland or mountain
Shall she warble her love-notes sweet.
Mourn, maidens ! ?tis darkened for ever,
The sun of a joyous life,
To rise again gladly never !
Swift snatch?d away in the strife.?
L?ENVOI.
See where the allied armies camped,
Where plumed and painted dancers tramped?
?Tis still the same, the same wild scene,
As though the ploughshare ne?er had been.
Grey Tomboritha still the skies
With bold and massy front defies ;
And gorge, and chasm, and long-ledged rocks
Echo the ever-thundering shocks
Of waters dashed with headlong force,
Wild cataracts leaping on their course.
In dark Maroka?s vale the stream
Reflects the slanting solar beam ;
There the proud lyre-bird * spreads his tail,
And mocks the notes of hill and dale ?
Whether the wild dog?s plaintive howl
Or cry of piping waterfowl,
The lyre-bird excels even the parrot in powers of mimicry.


Or the shrill parrot?s answering scream,
As, gem-like, dangling o?er the stream
He hears, re-echoed from the rock
The whirlwind whistle of the flock.
Alas ! and what a change is there !
And yet the landscape still is fair.
There smiled the woodland by the rill:
?Tis gone ?the waters turn a mill.
There the Mirbango village lay :
Mirbango maidens, where ? O say,
Where the tall braves, whose warrior songs
Once wooed the dark-eyed Darakongs.
Yon sheltered hollow, ?neath the steep,
Now dotted o?er with browsing sheep,
Holds the last graves the dark man owns ?
The treasure of his father?s bones.
All else, alas ! has passed, is o?er ;
Time?s wing has swept hill, vale, and shore ;
All, hence to farthest northern strand,
Obeys the white, ? the blood-stained hand;?
And grey-beards by the fire at night,
Warm, basking in its ruddy light,
The young, in solemn tones, advise
To shun all stranger-women?s eyes.
? Our fathers,? quoth they, ? as we trace,
Thus lost a country ?doomed a race.?
THE END.
