MACKAY:
THE SUGAROPOLIS OF QUEENSLAND.
... . »*■
In the past this delightful portion of the State of Queensland has not
commended itself to the average tourist in search of the picturesque—not
because it lacks this feature, but because of the difficulties that confront
the steamer passenger on disembarkation. He or she may have travelled
thus far in one of the fine coasting mail steamers, and to transfer one’s self
with luggage and impedimenta into a small steam tender requires a certain
amount of resolution. However, the ordeal has to be faced if one is to view
the beauties of the Sugaropolis of Queensland, as undoubtedly Mackay is;
but the reward is commensurate with the trouble.
Mackay is situated on the Pioneer River, about 3 miles from its mouth;
the mail steamers anchor off Flat-top Island and tranship their passengers,
mails, and cargo into tenders and lighters, the shallowness of the river
preventing large vessels entering. The whole efforts of the local Harbour
Board are now being centered on what is known as the Outer Harbour
Scheme, that most favoured being the construction of a line of railway from
the town across to a point near Flat-top, and the erection of breakwaters
and piers, full particulars of which will be found in another part of this book.
This work, when carried out, will undoubtedly give a great impetus to
the port, and tend to make it a stay-over place for those tourists who now
pass by.


The Post Office, Mackay.
(Corner of River and Wood Streets.)
Manager’s Residence, Marian Mill.
This picturesque little cottage, embowered in beautiful tropical foliage, possesses
peculiar interest for Australians, as it was the first home of Madame Melba after her
marriage. The place is locally known as the “ Nightingale’s Nest.”


Sydney Street, Mackay.
But we are pleased to say that, as far as the tourists’ traffic is con-
cerned, the district will in the near future not be dependent on water
conveyance, a line of railway extending from Rockhampton to Cairns, con-
necting the whole of the intermediate coastal towns, having received the
approval of Parliament; construction has already been started from several
points, so that the traveller will soon be able to leave Brisbane by Friday
night’s mail train at 10.25 p.ra., and arrive in Mackay on Sunday morning
in time for early breakfast.
The above disabilities, whilst they have kept away many tourists,
have not materially retarded the progress of the district; it is an undoubted
fact that there is no more progressive part of the State than this. Its one
great industry—Sugar—is the source of its wealth, and every other industry
takes second place. The cultivation of sugar-cane has always been regarded
as the aristocracy of agriculture, those engaged in the industry very seldom
going in for any other crop, although the soil and climate of Mackay produce
fruits of the finest quality. This is proved at the local agricultural shows;
the samples of citrus fruits, pineapples, and bananas exhibited would do
credit to any country in the world. No doubt in the near future these crops
will be largely cultivated for export and home consumption.
Tourists landing from coastal steamers at Flat Top, in addition to
visiting the town of Mackay, should not fail to see something of the agricultural
area served by the local railway. The traveller who has time to break his
journey will be able to start from Mackay Railway Station at 4 p.m. daily
(except Saturday, when the train leaves at 3 p.m.) and proceed to Eungella
Range, a distance of 45 miles. Before passing the town boundaries, fields of




Racecourse Central Mill (4 Miles from Mackay).
This is one of the two mills erected from money lent by the Queensland Govern
ment previous to the passing of “The Sugar Works Guarantee Act of 1893,” and has
proved a most successful undertaking to all concerned. The output for the 1909-10
season was 5,001 tons of 88 per cent. n.t. sugar from 40,408 tons of cane, being an average
of 8.07 tons of cane to 1 ton of sugar. The company paid to canegrowers £30,022 for the
season’s crop ; spent £3,306 in additions and repairs to mill ; paid in dividends £1,192 ;
and assets valued at £68,670, including cash £4,333.
sugarcane will already be in view, and as the train proceeds on its way various
sugar factories will be seen; “ the tall mill that whistles on the lea ” being
usually flanked by fine mango trees or graceful clumps of bamboo. Passing
Racecourse Mill, the tourist with a taste for mechanics will note up-to-date
electrical appliances, including a “grab,” the duty of which is to transfer sugar-
cane from a pile on the ground into the “carrier,” its capacity being 2 to 3 tons
each lift.
At a distance of 9 miles from Mackay the picturesque township of
Walkerston, embowered in mango trees, is passed ; and 6 miles further on
comes Newbury Junction, where light refreshments are dispensed. Another
stage of 7 miles brings the traveller to Mirani, pleasantly situated on the bank
of the Pioneer River, here spanned by a fine steel bridge used by the trains, but
having also a footway for pedestrians. At Finch Hatton, a comparatively new
and progressive township in the Cattle Creek Valley, 38 miles from the starting
point, the hungry traveller may obtain a substantial meal at one or other of
the three hotels near the Railway Station. The terminus —Eungella Range—
where comfortable hotel accommodation has been provided, is reached at
7.50 p.m. Those in search of healthful surroundings,running streams,and pure

Road up Eungelua Range,


North Eton Central Mill (21 Miles from Mackay).
This was one of the two sugar-mills erected from money lent by the Government
previous to the passing of “The Sugar Works Guarantee Act of 1893.” During the
1909-10 season 35,311 tons of cane were crushed here, producing 4,425 tons of 88 per
cent. n.t. sugar, £23,583 was paid to cane-growers for the season’s crop ; £3,068 was
paid to the State Government as interest and redemption on loan. The company own
and operate 21 miles of tramway.
mountain air will remain for a day or two and climb the coastal range, which
here rises abruptly to a height varying from 2,250 to 3,000 feet above sea level.
The return train to Mackay leaves Eungella Range at 6.10 a.m. daily,
and reaches its destination just before 10 a.m.
During the year ending December, 1910, harbour dues were paid on
23,561 tons of imports and 49,271 tons of exports —a total of 72,832 tons;
this is exclusive of Government goods, which are exempt from such charges.
During 1910, 462,259 tons of cane were crushed, from which 53,171
tons of sugar and 1,722,679 gallons of molasses were manufactured, being the
produce of 23,872 acres, whilst there were left standing 12,570 acres, the
average for the whole district being 8.69 tons of cane to 1 ton of sugar.

Tons Crushed. Yield of Sugar
A slight discrepancy will be noticed between the totals of the two sets of
figures above; this is accounted for by the fact that in some cases the mill
returns are for 88 per cent. n.t. sugar, and in others 94 per cent.
A number of sugar-mills in the district were erected under the
provisions of “ The Sugar Works Guarantee Act of 3893,” an Act which
was passed to encourage the growth of sugar-cane by white labour, the
Government agreeing to advance the cost of mills and machinery, taking as
security the deeds of the planters, in addition to a mortgage over mill building
and plants. Although in some few districts there has been default in
meeting obligations to the State, such is not the case with any of the mills in
Mackay, all obligations having been met to date; in the case of Racecourse
and Marian the debts have been entirely liquidated.
Of the total amount advanced, Mackay received £215,367, divided as

The road rises in a succession of zigzags. Magnificent views of the valleys of
Cattle Creek and Pioneer River and the numerous mountains in the locality are obtained.

The North Eton and Racecourse Mills were built previous to the
passing of the 1893 Act, the Government lending the money on the same
conditions which were afterwards the foundation of the Act.

Most of the mills have laid tramways through the farms, from which
their supplies of cane are drawn, the ramifications of which will be better
understood by reference to the map accompanying this book. Most of these
are worked by specially constructed locomotives, all being laid on a 2-foot
gauge.
The Pioneer River was discovered in May, 1860, by Captain John
Mackay, the present Portmaster of the State, after whom the town has been
named. This gentleman left Armidale, in New South Wales, in July, 1861,
his party consisting of five white men and one black boy, with 1,100 head of
cattle, arriving, after a journey of five months, on the southern brunch of
the Pioneer River on Christmas Eve of the same year, but, owing to the
broken nature of the country, did not reach the site of their station (Green-
mount) till early in 1862. For five months the party were completely cut off
from communication with their fellowmen; but in May, 1862, they received
a visit from Mr. Geo. E. Dalrymple, who was conducting an exploring party
towards the Burdekin River.
The next settlers were Messrs. Spencer, Cornish, Ross, and Muggleton
(of Balnagowan), and Martin and Atherton—all of whom followed pastoral
pursuits.
According to early historians, the first sugar-cane was planted by Mr.
John Spiller on the Ist June, 1865. Spiller had brought a number of cane
Avenue of Cocoanut Palms at Eimeo.
Eimeo is the favourite seaside resort for residents of Mackay, from which place
it is 12 miles distant.

plants from Java, some of
which he planted in his
garden for propagating
purposes, the balance
being entrusted to Cap-
tain Hope, of Cleveland.
The next planter was
T. H. F. Fitzgerald. The
first sugarmill was erected
by Messrs. Fitzgerald and
Davidson, at Alexandra,
in 1868. Between the
28th September and the
18th November of that
year, the output of this
mill was 110 tons of sugar;
this, compared with the
produce of last year
(1910), valued at about
£600,000 sterling, shows
wonderful expansion.

WHITSUNDAY PASSAGE
This is the name given by Captain Cook when
passing up the Eastern Coast of Australia in the
“Endeavour,” and, as it is studded with numerous
islands and islets covered with bright green vegetation,
makes this portion of the North Queensland trip replete
with interest.
On leaving Mackay and proceeding northwards, the
Cumberland Group of Islands is seen to the eastward,
the two largest being Shaw and Lindeman, most of the
others being very small, Lindeman being occupied as
a sheep station. From Lindeman looking northwards
the most striking object is Pentecost or Lion Island,
bearing a strong resemblance to the figure of a crouching
lion; still further to the north are Dent, Whitsunday,
and Hook Islands, on the former of which a lighthouse
is erected.
The Barrier Beef forms a breakwater for the ocean
swell, rendering the passage by sea as a rule calm and
pleasant, although with a strong northerly or southerly
wind the sea can assert itself rather unpleasantly to the
landsman; still such is the exception, and usually
travellers are able to enjoy the beauties of the Passage
without a qualm.

Marian Sugar Mill, Pioneer River (17 Miles from Mackay),
The output of this mill for the season 1909-10 was 6,509 tons of sugar, produced
from 52,735 tons of cane. £36,340 was paid to cane-growers ; £8,834 was spent on
tramway construction and maintenance, and £4,392 on mill and buildings for additions
and improvements.
Some years ago the Public Estates Improvement Branch of the Lands
Department undertook the construction of a road over the Eungella Range,
with a view of opening up the rich tableland scrubs on the summit; the work
was carried out at a considerable cost, and it is a matter for regret that it
has been allowed to deteriorate until at the present time it is a mere bridle-
track. Numerous landslips have taken place, and so far no attempt has been
made to repair the ravages caused by time and weather. The climate on the
range is most bracing : as a sanatorium no more desirable spot could be
selected. Mackay citizens would find it to their advantage to have this
road opened up again, and make provision for the accommodation of
those enervated by the moist heat of the coast lands. As a
speculation, there is no doubt it would be a financial success.
The distance from the railway terminus is trifling, and, with the road made
available for vehicular traffic, a motor service could land passengers on the
summit, at a height of 2,500 feet, in five hours from Mackay.

MACKAY: THE SUGAEOPOLIS OF QUEENSLAND.


As the range is ascended, glorious views are obtained. In the fore-
ground are numerous mountain peaks, such as The Pinnacle, Mia Mia,
Kinchant, McGregor, Toby, De Molyns, Yince, The Leap, Blackwood, and
others too numerous to mention; whilst to the east is the full stretch of the
Pacific Ocean studded with numerous islands —Round and Flat-top, close to
Mackay, with others of the Cumberland and Whitsunday Groups stretching
away to the north-east. In the valley at our feet we can discern the sinuous
windings of Cattle Creek and the Pioneer River, their banks clothed with
beautiful scrub intermingled with sugar-cane farms and plantations, giving
a variety of colour that must be seen to be appreciated.
MACKAY HARBOUR IMPROVEMENTS.
The development of the Port of Mackay has engaged the serious
attention of different Governments of the State for many years; reports have
been obtained from some of the ablest harbour engineers, and several schemes
have been proposed. Finally, a Board of Inquiry was constituted, consisting
of Messrs. T. W. Keele, M.1.C.E., E. A. E. Cullen, M.1.C.E., and A. J.
Lamont. These gentlemen visited Mackay in the early part of 1911, and as
the result of their investigations submitted an exhaustive report to the State
Treasurer. In it they reviewed the recommendations contained in earlier
reports; they also visited Port Newey, Dalrymple Bay, Slade Point, and
Shoal Point, each of which sites had their advocates; but all were abandoned
in favour of the Flat-top Island scheme, as shown in the accompanying sketch.
Their recommendation, briefly put, is to construct a northern break-
water of the largest blocks of stone obtainable, not to be less than 4 tons
weight on face and 2 tons in centre; to be 12 feet above H.W. springs, with
a top width of 15 feet and a length of 15,000 feet; to be afterwards extended
to 2,000 feet, and ultimately when required to 2,500 feet.
A western breakwater to be built along the south-west spit to a height
of 12 feet to above lI.W. springs, 12 feet wide on top; a roadway to be made
along the western side of the island, reaching to the south-west spit.
A wharfage pier, 750 feet long by 90 feet, connected with the roadway
by a jetty 100 feet long and 24 feet wide; the approach and berthage to be
dredged out to a depth of 26 feet L.W.S.; a viaduct built of reinforced
concrete, 1,200 feet long, meeting the extremity of the western breakwater,
on which a railway line will be built for ordinary railway purposes; this line
to traverse the western breakwater, roadway, jetties, and pier.
The total cost of the above work is estimated at £365,700, including
dredge £35,000 and dredging £lO,OOO. This seems a large outlay for a
population not exceeding 25.000, with a cultivated area of 120,000 acres;

but the residents are willing to face that responsibility and shoulder the
burden. The Harbour Board estimates its revenue will reach £30,000 per
year, and expenditure at about £26,500; the latter including £15,162 for
interest and redemption on Government loan.
The Board winds up its report with a recommendation that the
necessary legislation be passed to provide for the work. A Bill has been
passed by both Houses of the Legislature, conferring upon the Harbour
Board the enlarged borrowing powers; and no doubt this long-desired work
will be commenced immediately.
