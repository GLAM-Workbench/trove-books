It is cold; Go on by us;
Make a fire; Go, as we go;
The fire burns; We do go on,
Now lam warm; Let us all go;
Let us go home; Now let us try,
We can run; We will all try.
We may walk. Who cut the pen?
The boys play; He cut the nib,
The girl learns; As you cut it,
The cat purrs; I cut it too:
The dogs bark. See, it is fine.
Cut my quill; I dug a pit,
Mend my pen; Do you see it?
I will write. 'Yes, now I do.
Pull the cord; Who is in it?
Ring the bell; No one as yet.
How it rings! My hat is on,
Clean your teeth. May Igo now?
Wash your face; Yes, you may go;
Comb your hair; Let us all go,
j Brush your hat. Let us all run.

Bell.
Ring the bell,
Call the girls,
Let them read too.
A new book,
Keep it clean,
Now read in it.
Make a pie,
Bake some cakes,
Broil some beef.
Feed the birds,
Give them drink,
Hear them sing.
A hard stone,
A large nut,
Crack the nut.
Spur the horse,
He runs fast,
Now he stops.
The pale moon,
The light is dim,
The night is long.
The sun shines,
The morn is clear,
Let us take a walk,
Walk in the shade.

Jane has a fan,
It cost ten cents,
Do not spoil it.
A dog run mad,
He bit a cow,
The cow run mad too
I saw a man,
He had a gun,
He shot a bird.
I met a good boy,
He had a new book,
He read well in it.
It is quite late,
I must go to school,
And say my task.
The air is cool,
My dress is thin,
I may take cold.
Charles lost his ball,'
His bat went next,
He is now quite sad.

Here is his nice ball,
There lies his bat.

can we catch the horse when we want to

he would fly off to the end of the field, and
be out of our reach.

Yes, I can, if you like to play my way; but

THE BOY AND BUTTERFLY.
See that little naughty boy going to beat
clown the poor butterfly with his hat.
0 ! fie, lioy ; you will hurt the poor thing
sadly : you will break its little legs and its
pretty wings.
Do not be so cruel. Do you think, if you
were a butterfly, you would like to be knock-
ed down, and have your limbs broken ?
Pray, then, do not hurt that poor little crea-
ture, which never did you any harm in all its
life.
It likes to fly from rose to rose, from pink
to pink, from flower to flower, to sip the ho-
neyed dew which is its food.
Pretty butterfly, enjoy thyself in all thy
pleasures, for thy life is but short.
Little boy, put on your hat, and let the little
innocent creature remain in the fields.


PICKET'S PKIMER, 31 |
JBOYS IN AN APPLE TREE.
See the boys in the apple tree. They are
picking the apples. They all seem to enjoy
themselves. Take care, my little fellows, or
you may fall and break a bone. See, the man
knocks the apples down, and the woman picks
them up. Apples are good fruit, but you must
not eat too many of them. Cider is made of
apples. There is a cider mill. If we had no
rain we should have no apples. If we had
no sun we should have no apples. Who gives
us the rain and the sun, the apples, and so ma-
ny other good things ? It is God. Then let
us love him, and do nothing that will make
him angry with us. He loves all good chil-
dren, but he does not love those that are bad.
He made us. He is our father.
