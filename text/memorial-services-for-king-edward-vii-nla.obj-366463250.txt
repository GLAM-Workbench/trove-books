Hymn — t£ O Gog! L Our Help.’”
0 God L our help in ages past,.
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast*
And our eternal home.
Under the shadow of Thy throne*
Still may we dwell secure *
Sufficient is Thine arm alone*
And our defence is sure.
Before the hills in'order stood*
Or earth received her frame*
From everlasting Thou art God*
To endless years the same.
A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone,
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
The busy tribes of flesh and blood*
With all their cares and fears,
Are carried downward by the flood*
And lost in following years.
Time, like an ever-rolling stream*
Bears all its sons away ;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
0 God 1 our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come*
Be Thou our guard while life shall last*
And our perpetual home.

Hymn—“ Nearer, My God, to Thee.” 5
Nearer, my God, to Thee !
Nearer to Thee !
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me ;
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee !
Nearer to Thee !




I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless ;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness ;
Where is death’s sting ? where, grave, thy victory ?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me I
Reveal Thyself before my closing eyes *
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies.
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows
In life and death, O Lord, abide with me I

Hymn—“ Now the Laborer’s Task is O’er.”
Now the laborer’s task is o’er
Now the battle day is past;
Now upon the farther shore.
Lands the voyager at last.
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There the tears of earth are dried ;
There its hidden things are clear;
There the work of life is tried
By a juster Judge than here.
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There the. sinful souls, that turn
To the Cross their dying eyes.
All the love of Christ shall learn
At His feet in Paradise.
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There no more the powers of hell
Can prevail to mar their peace ;
Christ the Lord shall guard them well
He who died for their release.
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
“■Earth to earth, and dust to dust,”
Calmly now the words we ssy.
Leaving Him to sleep in trust
Till the Resurrection-day.
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping,
Benediction.
