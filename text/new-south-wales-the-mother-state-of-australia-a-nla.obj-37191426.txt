Preface
Shortly after the formation of the Intelligence Department, acting on the general
instructions of the Premier (Hon. J. H. Carrutheks, M.L.A.), I planned a work which
would give, in a concise form, such general information about New South Wales as would
be desired by a person proposing to emigrate from the Old World to the State, or needed
by an immigrant on arriving here with his wife and family. This “ Guide for Immigrants
and Settlers,” as originally forecast, was divided into thirty chapters, and the assistance of
competent men in the Public Service was invoked to supply the expert information needed.
The numerous inquiries received in this Department since the policy of assisted immigration
was initiated in January, 1906, have given me further clues to the varied kinds of hints
likely to be asked for, and every effort has been put forth to make this publication as
complete as possible for the purpose in view, in order to save the expense of making
separate and individual replies to the many inquiries from Kurope and America, for minute
details about our conditions of life in New South Wales. Some of the chapters as supplied
to us had to be remodelled, others re-written. In the meantime Mr. Percy Hunter was
appointed Editor of Publications, and the work of co-relating the diverse views, rectifying
overlapping functions, ami correcting obsolete statistics, fell into a relentless journalist’s
capable hands. Credit has been given in every case where due, the author’s name appearing
at the head of each article contributed by any officer or other person outside this Depart-
ment. For the articles not signed the editor and myself are responsible. The only “ other
persons” above referred to are Professor Anderson Stuart, Mr. 11. G. McKinney, and
Mr. W, Hessel Hall. To the first has to be credited the chapter on Health, which will
be much appreciated by fathers and mothers newly come to settle amongst us; to the
second gentleman we owe the useful notes on Irrigation, the outcome of his experience
first as an engineer in India, and afterwards as Chief Engineer for Water Conservation
in this State; and to the last-mentioned we are indebted for the valuable article on
Bee-keeping, the result of his own practical and successful labours at the Lapstone Apiary,
on the slopes of the Blue Mountains, near Emu Plains, Perhaps the simple facts now
stated will adequately account for any small discrepancies in facts and in figures that may
have escaped the editorial eye, also for some want of homogeneity in the plan of treatment,
and diversity of tone, spirit and flavour. This will, it is hoped, be corrected by our own
efforts, aided by criticism friendly and otherwise; and when the present edition of 7,000
copies shall have been placed by the Immigration Officer of the Agent-General’s Office in
London, we shall bring out a new edition which will, we confidently trust, be more worthy
of our excellent subject and our own aspirations. The part of the book with which we
feel that we have most cause to be satisfied is the illustrations, which were made from
photographs, most of which were got specially for this work by the cordial co-operation of
the Government Printer (Mr. W. A. Gullick). If there be any inappropriate views in this
edition, they will be replaced in the next one by new and striking pictures of typical
industrial scenes, now being procured from different parts of the State.
The experience of the needs of immigrants and settlers, which we expect to gain
during the coming year, will doubtless suggest many additions to and amendments of the
letterpress.

NEW SOUTH WALES TH E MOTHER STATE
A GUIDE FOR IMMIGRANTS AND SETTLERS.
CHAPTER I.
Historical.
BY F. M. BLADEN, F.R.G.S.,
BARRISTKR-AT-LAW.
HE history of New South Wales as a British possession
commenced on 28th April, 1770, when Captain Cook,
accompanied by Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander,
landed at Kurnell on the southern shore of Botany
Bay, and took possession of the country in the name
of King George the Third.
Eighteen years afterwards Governor Phillip
arrived from England, and at Sydney Cove, Port
Jackson, founded a settlement, repeating Captain
CAPTAIN COOK’S LANDING-PLACE.
Cook’s act of taking possession. The first few years were spent in struggling against adverse
conditions. Poor and scanty food, insufficient and inferior clothing, defective implements
and tools, and a narrow strip of unproductive coastland, were amongst the principal
obstacles with which the first settlers had to contend. In 1792, Governor Phillip, worn out
bv the strain of undivided responsibilities, returned to England.
Practically speaking, the Colony, during Phillip’s administration, lived on the rations
received from England. There were a few small farms on the Parramatta and Lane Cove
Rivers, but they contributed very little to the food supply.
Major Grose (Acting-Governor during Phillip’s absence), may be said to have initiated
the agricultural and farming industry. He gave to his officers farm lands and labourers, and
encouraged them to cultivate maize and wheat, purchasing, for the Government stores, their
harvests at prices as high as 10s. per bushel for wheat, and ss. per bushel for maize. Early
in 1794, he sent twenty-two pioneer farmers up to the fertile banks of the Upper Hawkesbury
A


River. Their small thirty-five acre blocks covered the whole of the right bank of Pitt Reach.
The success of the experiment was immediate.
Major Grose reported in April, 1794, that “ whatever they have planted has grown in
the greatest luxuriance.” In August of the same year their numbers had increased to seventy ;
in June, 1795, the farms extended for thirty miles on both sides of the river, and the settlers
and their families
numbered 304
persons. In June,
1799, the popula-
tion at the
Hawkesbury was
955, nearly all of
them being free
settlers. At this
time, and for
many years after-
wards, the
flats flanking the
Hawkesbury and
Nepean Rivers

granary of the
Colony ; in fact,

crops were so plentiful that the small marketjat the capital of Sydney was glutted.
In the matter of live stock, the early settlers were, if anything, less fortunate. In
September, 1788, Governor Phillip wrote that while their hogs and poultry were thriving,
only one sheep, out of seventy purchased at the Cape, remained. The whole of the cattle were
either dead or lost. From this time until September, 1791, the Colony was practically destitute
of horned live stock. In that month Lieutenant-Governor King landed from H.M.S. “ Gorgon ”
with 18 head of cattle and 59 sheep from the Cape. In April, 1793, some swine, one calf, and
four sheep were landed from the Californian coast. In March, 1795, the officers imported from
the Cape 74 horses and 12 sheep.
In 1795 a large herd of wild cattle were found in the Cow Pasture (Camden) district. They
were the progeny of the Cape cattle which had wandered into the bush and been lost, soon after
Phillip landed. In 1797, Captain Waterhouse and Lieutenant Kent brought from the Cape
a number of pure bred Spanish merino sheep. From this year the production of high-class
wool may be said to date. The total live stock, including that in the possession of the Crown,
was at this time as follows :—Cattle, 327; sheep, 2,457. In ten years (1807) it had risen to
6,643 and 25,260 respectively.


The Early
Settler.
In the early decades of the century, the British Government spared no
pains to settle men of means upon the soil. To the intending emigrant
commanding a minimum sum of £5OO, exceptional inducements were given.
Free passages were provided for himself, his family, and servants ; his goods,
furniture, and stock were carried free, and when he landed he was given a free grant pro-
portionate to his capital; convict servants were assigned to him, and for some time after
landing rations w r ere furnished from the public store ; and finally, at harvest time, the Govern-
ment storekeeper purchased his surplus wheat and maize. In this way the fortunes of many
families of present day prominence were founded by men of birth and culture. The remarkable
healthiness of the climate, particularly the absence of malarial and febrile diseases, from which
the early settlers in America suffered so much, was a great inducement to men of means
and retired officers in England and India to emigrate to New South Wales.
SYDNEY COVE 1800-1900.


In 1813 the need for more extensive pastoral land was accentuated by drought; and,
a route having been discovered over the Blue Mountains by Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson,
an immediate exodus of settlers and stock from the coastal districts, took place.
From about the year 1820, the occupation of the country drained by the
Macquarie and Lachlan Rivers steadily increased. This period saw the
birth of the familiar squatter. In the first instance he was a trespasser
on Crown lands lying beyond the confines of settlement. Before long

his existence was recognised by the Government, and a small annual license fee charged.
With incredible
rapidity these
pioneers of
civilisation
penetrated and
occupied the
interior. In
1827 they were

enormous increases in population and in the area of discovered country. In the former year,
the population, including that of Van Diemen’s Land, was only 79,306; at the close of
1841 it had increased at the phenomenal rate of 10 per cent, yearly, and amounted to
206,095. This increase will appear the more remarkable, when we remember that it occurred
long before there was any idea that gold was procurable. It was before the partition of the
mother colony, and before the full measure of political autonomy had been conceded. The
explorations of Sturt and Mitchell, following closely on those of Oxley, Evans, Meehan,
Throsby, Cunningham, Hume, and Hovell, had thrown New South Wales open as far west-
ward as the Darling, and southward to the Lower Murray; in addition, the nuclei of future
colonies were forming at Port Phillip, Adelaide, and Swan River, and an enormous area of
vacant country was thus made available.
These facts were not unknown in England, and afford one explanation
why so many hardy and venturesome immigrants arrived. It was the
period of emigrants’ guides and handbooks, in which the high wages and
broad acres of Australia were painted in glowing colours. Another great

Wool Industry.
attraction which Australia possessed at this time was its growing reputation as a country


eminently suited, by climatic and other conditions, for the production of high-class wool.
The credit of demonstrating the possibilities of Australia in this respect belongs to John
McArthur, though he had not, as is popularly supposed, any hand in the importation of the
first merino sheep.
The growth of the wool trade at this stage of the Colony’s history may be gathered
from the fact that the quantity of wool exported in 1840 was 13,364,(XK) lb., as compared with
1,893,0001 b. in 1830, and 99,000 Ib. in 1820. The later development of the industry will be
found dealt with in its proper place.
The whale and seal fisheries in the early days, occupied much more attention than is
now realised. In one year (1836) the export of oil, skins, &c., amounted to nearly a million
and a quarter sterling.
The estimation in which Australia was held in England in the forties
(when transportation had practically ceased), can be gathered from the
statement of a contributor to Blackwood's Magazine in July, 1848 :
“ Australia is the greatest accession to substantial power ever made by

England. It is the gift of a continent unstained by war, usurpation, or the sufferings of a
people. It may be said that during the first half of the century three elements contributed
to the remarkable prosperity of the Colony—first, the existence of large areas of good and
accessible land, suitable both for pastoral and agricultural occupation ; second, the presence
of sufficient
and reliable
markets, both
local and
foreign ; and
third, an abun-
dance of cheap
labour.

separation of Victoria, and the discovery in the same year of gold in the Bathurst district.
Population flocked to the Colony in unprecedented numbers. This was not an unmixed and


universal advantage. Labour was for some time diverted from its normal channels, and the
more permanent industries of the country suffered. It was not long, however, before the
affairs of the State righted themselves. In two years (1851-3) the trade of the Colony
more than doubled itself, and a general revival in industries and agriculture took place.
One consequence of the increase in population and wealth which marked
this epoch in the Colony’s history, was a general dissatisfaction with the
form of government, culminating, in 1856, in the concession of responsible
government. This was a time of widespread activity; railways, electric

telegraphs, postal service, and steamship communication were quickly transforming the face
of the country, and ameliorating the conditions of life.
In 1859 the last division of the mother colony took place, and Queensland was proclaimed
a separate dependency.
The feverish absorption of the gold-mining mania was, naturally, followed
by a period of reaction, which took the shape of a revival of the agricultural
and pastoral activity of the forties. As the attractiveness of the gold
diggings wore off, men clamoured for land. It was, however, impossible to

meet their demands under the old system of auction sales ; and, in 1861, under Sir John
Robertson’s Land Act, they were allowed to select and occupy their holdings before they
had been surveyed. The provisions of this Act and subsequent amending Acts will be more
appropriately dealt with in the chapter bearing on the Land Laws ; here it is sufficient to
note that they had an important bearing on the history of the Colony, inasmuch as they
tended to facilitate the operations of men of limited
means who w r ere desirous of going on the land.
It is impossible, within the limits of a sketch
so brief as this is, to deal with even the leading facts
in our history, such as the inception and extension of
our railways, the history of our educational system,
our technical colleges and university, the growth of a
free Press, the birth and condition of our manufactures,
and the vast mass of domestic legislation which our
statute books contain.
The most significant aspect of present day
public thought has been the growing appreciation of
our Imperial responsibilities. Evidences of this were
prominent in the recent Boer war, and in the willing-

naval defence. Some such sentiment as this was, doubtless, partly responsible for the move-
ment which culminated in the federation of the Australian States.

New South Wales as a Field for the
Immigrant and Settler.
A Brief Resume of the Resources and Industries
of the State Prospects for Newcomers
Cost of Living Food Supply Attractive
Tourist Resorts.
S a field for immigration, New South Wales, the wealthiest
fslg\ y and most prosperous of the Australias, is almost
■ rv-n without a rival. To the man in Great Britain, thinking
fC r ... >■ Aj.--) of changing his home, a journey to the antipodes
may, at first sight, appear something of a formidable
undertaking. Because New South Wales is 12,000 miles distant from Europe, he may be
inclined to turn his thoughts in the direction of some nearer field for his endeavour to carve
out fortune from a new and kindly territory. But the thought of distance should not deter
him, nor turn him from the path along which lies the most material advantage. The
modern steamship, palatial in size and appointments, swift almost as an express train, and as
well providored as a London hotel, reduces the 12,000 miles’ voyage to a mere holiday
jaunt, and a most pleasurable one at that. The Australian liner traverses no dangerous
waters, encounters no icebergs, and never lies in the track of those ocean greyhounds that dash
through the Atlantic at breakneck pace, oblivious of everything but the chance of smashing
the record for the trip. The voyage from England to Australia is eminently a safe one ; it is
made through summer seas, where every prospect is novel and entrancing ; it brings the
voyager into touch en route with some of the oldest and most interesting countries in the world.
As a holiday experience it is unparalleled ; as an educative factor it is of great importance.
11l order to induce the British agriculturist to try his fortune in New South
Wales, the Government of the State has made arrangements with several
shipping companies, including those whose mammoth steamers thread the
Suez Canal, and call at the wonderlands of Egypt and India by the way,

for exceedingly low fares to cover the six weeks’ voyage. An immigrant, approved by the
New South Wales Agent-General in London, may be carried right to Sydney, the chief city of
the Southern Hemisphere, for from £8 to £l2 third class, and £2B second class. Thus, by the


liberal provision of the New South Wales Government, an immigrant may enjoy a wonderful
holiday journey over historic routes, the pleasures and delights of which will never vanish
from his memory, see a number of strange lands, and disembark in the very best of the new
countries for the ridiculously small sum of £B. He will meet with no cold weather on the
journey, and light clothing will suffice for all his needs. When he leaves the old land for New
South Wales, he will have done with snow and sleet, grey skies, ami biting east winds, and
will enter into a heritage of glorious sunshine and balmy atmospheres.
Now what has New South Wales to offer to the immigrant ? It offers
opportunities both to the man with and to the man without capital. It is
the land of rapid advancement, of equal opportunity. A rich reward awaits
application, energy, and perseverance. For the capitalist there are many

industries and avenues of activity awaiting exploitation. A young, vigorous, and fast-growing
population provide an expansive home
consumption ; and the world’s markets,
owing to the magnificent lines of com-
munication linking Australia with the
older countries, lie within easy striking
distance. For the agriculturist with a
small capital it may be said that New
South Wales possesses nearly 20,(XX).000
acres of good virgin wheat land, within
the 20 inches rainfall belt, awaiting
settlement. A large proportion of this
land has been alienated by the Crown,
but the policy of the Government is
now to resume estates suited for close
settlement and wheat-farming, and
make them available for immigrants
and local settlers. This work is also
being done privately, and a number of

big estates are at present being subdivided in various districts ; so that the man with sufficient
capital to enable him to make a start with a farm will have no difficulty whatever in procuring
the land he needs.
The terms upon which the land is sold, both by the Government and by
private owners, are exceedingly liberal, and only small deposits are required.
Land that is suited for wheat-growing combined with grazing will fetch

are well improved and ready for immediate profitable occupation. Full particulars as to land
available, and prices and terms, may be obtained on application to the New South Wales Agent-
General, 125, Cannon-street, London, E.C., or the Intelligence Department, Phillip and Bridge
streets, Sydney. It may be felt that the New South Wales Government should emulate the
examples of other Governments and make a free grant of land to immigrants ; but it will
usually be found that what costs nothing is worth nothing. There is land in New South Wales
which could be acquired for the proverbial song, but it is a long way from the railway line,
and outside the area where the practical certainty of an average rainfall of 20 inches makes
wheat-growing profitable. The owner of a good farm in the New’ South Wales wheat belt has
an asset which in a few years will make him a prosperous landed proprietor. It may be safelv
stated that no other country at the present time offers such unrivalled opportunities to practical
farmers with a small capital as New South Wales. Not only will they find a congenial climate
and surroundings, but they will have the advantange of living under a Constitution the freest
in the world, and at the same time be sure of securing a profitable and rapid return for their
labour. On arrival in Sydney immigrants are taken in hand by officers of the Intelligence
Department, their needs are ascertained and the best advice is given them. If they wish to
obtain either Crowui or private lands they are immediately put in touch with experienced
officers, who will afford them every assistance. Liberal concessions on the railways are granted
to those who purchase land for settlement, both in regard to passengers’ tickets and furniture
and effects.
For men without capital, but possessed of agricultural experience, there
are abundant openings, as the New South Wales agricultural industry is
expanding rapidly and good farm labourers are always in demand. Youths

is not the only avenue of activity open to men with small capital. The dairying industrv

prosperous circumstances, who started only a few years ago with no capital but a hopeful
heart in a sound and healthy frame.


The State of New South Wales comprises an area of 198,634,880 acres, or a little over
two and a half times that of Great Britain and Ireland put together. The coastal area—that
lying between the Main Dividing Range and the sea —may be taken as the first division of the
State. It comprises some 18,000,000 acres, and is fertile and well watered, enjoying an average
rainfall of 42 inches. It is traversed by fifteen rivers of various sizes, all of which flow into
the South Pacific Ocean. The tablelands of the Great Dividing Range contain some 39,500,000
acres, and mav be classed as the second great division of the State. On these tablelands

many of which attain an average altitude of 3,000 feet—will be found some of the richest
agricultural lands in the State, on which the farming methods of the old country can be followed
successfully, and, though situated at no great distance from the tropics, their climate is so mild
and bracing that they are becoming famous as health resorts. The average rainfall may be
taken at about 25 to 31 inches, though in some parts it is far heavier. The third division of
the agricultural portion of the State—the western slopes of the tableland—containing an area
of some 54,000,000 acres, is also a rich and fertile district, with an average rainfall of from


17 to 20 inches. Beyond this the rainfall is smaller, and the country better adapted for raising
merino wool—the wool grown here being the very best of its kind in the world—than for farm-
ing operations, excepting where irrigation is practised.
Best Climate
in
the World.
In the matter of climate New South Wales is particularly blessed. It
would be by no means an exaggeration to say that the climate of the State,
at any rate in the middle coastal district, is the best in the world. Every-
where throughout the territory the climate is genial. In the farming districts
there is no long bleak winter, the days of the New South Wales winter months
being for the most part warm and sunshiny, the early mornings and nights being of course
colder. In summer the heat is not by any means terrible. Heat waves, such as occasionally
sweep New ork and other parts of America, are unknown. In the coastal region the summer
is exceedingly mild ; as a rule, even in the hot districts, the nights are cool and refreshing.
There are great areas of New South Wales which know neither extreme of heat nor of cold,
but enjoy all the year round a beautifully even and pleasant temperature, slightly warmer in
summer and slightly colder in winter, broken only by a few days’ rain here and there through
the seasons. Practically, the only inclement weather is wet weather, and it is no doubt this
magnificent climate, kind and genial, that renders New South Wales, both for man and stock,
the most healthy country in the world. In no other land is the farmer and stock-keeper less
plagued by disease in his household, his animals, or his crops. Save in the mountain districts,
and on the highlands, only very light clothing is necessary all the year round ; houses may be
of exceedingly light construction and yet perfectly comfortable ; men may camp in the open
without a tent, and out-door existence is by far the most pleasurable method of enjoying life.
This mildness of climate is a matter of great importance to settlers, as it materially reduces
the cost of farming, both by reason of the fact that live stock require no housing nor rugging,
and the harvesting operations are greatly facilitated. The glorious weather always enjoyed in
New South Wales gives the State a great advantage over countries where the farmer is practi-
cally snowed up for five or six months of the year, or where the fierceness of the sun burns and
blisters his crops before he can garner them. The
Australian droughts, of which so much has been
said, occur only at long intervals, and they have
their effect chiefly in the country beyond the line
of the 20-inch rainfall, outside which line settlers
are not advised to cultivate wheat. It is the
great pastoral industry carried on in the Western
Division of the State where the rainfall is uncer-
tain that suffers most from the drought when one
occurs; but so prolific is this country under good seasons that one or two good years give returns
of high-class wool that more than compensate for a run of dry seasons. The quality of the soil
in this Western country is of a very high degree, and frequently, when rain falls opportunely
after a dry spell, the growth is so luxuriant that the fine pasture grasses reach over the withers olj,

horses. Taking the coast generally, the difference between the mean summer and the mean
winter temperature may be set down as averaging not more than 24 degrees—a range so
small as to be but rarely found elsewhere. The famed resorts of the Mediterranean seaboard
bear no comparison with the Pacific Slopes of New South Wales, either for natural salubrity,
or for the comparative mildness of the summer and winter.
Wheat-growing, perhaps, offers the most attractive field to the agricultural
newcomer who has enough capital to take up an area of land and prepare
it for the plough. He will find in New South Wales that he is very fortunately
placed. He will not be hampered by weather conditions in his ploughing or

per acre, in New South Wales it is not more than about 17s. ; while an expert calculation,
giving full details, has recently been published placing the figure at 13s. 9d. Wheat may be
considered at bed-rock value when it brings 2s. fid. per bushel at a New South Wales country
railway station, while it, of course, frequently brings higher prices than that. From these
figures a prospective wheat-grower can see the probable value of his crops. The average yield
for a number of years over the whole of the State has been 10 bushels to the acre, and the
crop failed in one season only—l9o3, In the following year, however, the average was 17
bushels to the acre. At the end of March, 1905, the cultivated area of the State was 3,280,970
acres, and the area under wheat 1,775,955 acres. In 1905, the wheat crop realised 16,464,415

bushels, giving a large exportable surplus. The present harvest has resulted in the return of
about 20,000,000 bushels, and the indications are that a very rapid expansion will take place
from now onward.
So far as communication with the outside markets of the world is concerned,
the New South Wales wheat-grower suffers no handicap on account of his
immense distance from Europe. It should not be forgotten that the wheat
is grown in New South Wales at no great distance from the coast, and, there-

fore, the grain has not to be hauled for 1,500 miles over expensively-maintained railways
before the ship’s side is reached. In New
South Wales, too, the railways are owned
by the Government, and are conducted on
lines which keep the successful development
of the country well in view. Thus, as
regards ocean freights, Canada, of course,
has an advantage over Australia ; but from
farm to market the advantage is with the
Australian grower. For instance, Regina,

miles from Sydney, and even less for South Australian and Victorian produce. The size of
the wheat-farms varies from 500 to 5,000 acres.
The man who thinks of settling in New South Wales need by no means
confine his activities to wheat-growing. A system of mixed farming, of
cropping and stock-raising, is becoming popular. It keeps the farmer
occupied in the long period when he can do little or nothing to help the wheat,
and increases the productiveness of his farm, and consequently his profits. In

the New England districts, on the tablelands, are numbers of settlers who combine fruit-growing
with crop-raising, apples doing splendidly in these localities. But the great auxiliary of wheat-
growing is sheep-raising. There are, at the present moment, over 11,000 flocks of sheep in the
State of 500 sheep and under, and 2,700 flocks numbering between 500 and 1,000 each ;so it
will be seen that sheep-raising is practised by a very large number of small holders. The merino
predominates, but latterly the farmers are taking to growing a good style of cross-bred that
produces both wool and first-class mutton, and is altogether a very profitable animal to handle.
There is a limitless field in New South Wales for the mutton trade, which is as yet scarcelv
touched. Wheat farmers run their sheep on natural grasses and on the stubble and growth
in the cultivation paddocks that are not in use. The sheep is a cleaning and fertilising agent


all over the country, and never fails to improve the capacity of the pasture unless the land

per lb. in the grease. There are many other crops that the farmer may raise, prominent among
them being sugar-cane, the cultivation of which forms, with dairying, the chief occupation of
the settlers on the Northern rivers. Sugar-cane is an exceedingly valuable crop, and a great
stretch of the Northern River district of New South Wales is peculiarly well adapted for it.
There is room for great expansion in this direction, and an assured market for all the sugar grown.
Immense areas of the State, too, are suitable in every way for the cultivation of malting barley
of the brightest colour, and fine germinating properties. At present only some 15,000 acres
of the State are under barley, and such success has been achieved in the cultivation that doubt-
less greatly increased attention will be devoted to it in the future. Bulk samples of New South
Wales barley, recently sent to Great Britain and America, were most favourably commented
upon, and the bright colour and superior malting properties of the grain caused it to be ranked
for brewers’ purposes in the highest place among all competitors. Maize is another crop to
which the farmer may turn his attention with profit and advantage, from 80 to 100 bushels
per acre being not an uncommon return; and in certain districts lucerne is most successfully

cultivated, while in the northern portion of the State bananas,
coffee, passion-fruit, and other tropical fruits and plants grow in
wild profusion, side by side with potatoes, cereals, tobacco, onions,
vines, and other products of colder climes ; in fact, New South
Wales extends over so many degrees of latitude, and the soil and
climate are so varied, that it would be hard to mention a crop
which would not thrive in some portion of the State. A most
important industry is that of wine-making, the soil and climate
of New South Wales possessing all the elements necessary for the
production of first-class wines, both sweet and dry. At present
some 8,800 acres of the State are planted with vines, and the area
is being increased each year. At international exhibitions, New
South Wales wines have gained the highest encomiums from
judges accustomed to test the vintages of the world. The export market has so far been hardlv
touched by New South Wales wine-growers, only some 100,000 gallons being exported annually.
With conditions so favourable, and land so cheaply and readily obtained, investors are likely
to find a great and profitable return in the development of this industry.
The whole stretch of the immense New South Wales coast line is suitable
for the dairying industry, in which the State has made its greatest advance
in recent years. The butter export trade is a great and growing one, £BlB,OOO
worth of butter having been exported in 1904-5. There are large areas of
land suitable for dairying obtainable at a comparatively small cost, and the

industry is capable of almost illimitable expansion. The general adoption of the factory system
in all the chief dairying districts of the State ensures a ready cash return for the milk or cream
of the suppliers. Though the industry is mainly confined to the coastal regions, it is also
actively pursued in the more favoured parts of the interior, and the tendency to devote good
pasture lands to the production of butter is spreading fast. The breeding of pigs is generally
carried on in conjunction with dairying, and as New South Wales still imports bacon and ham
it will be seen that there is plenty of room for expansion in this direction. Horse and cattle
breeding is also conducted extensively ; and a somewhat new departure, successfully established,
is the raising of angora goats for mohair.
New South Wales is entering upon an era of solid prosperity, and is advanc-
ing by leaps and bounds. The value of her products won from the soil in
the season just closed was £45,000,000 —a marvellous achievement for
slightly over 1,500,000 of people,—a result per head not attained by any
other country outside Australia. Her trade for the same period was

£66,000,000, or £44 per head, which is nearly double that of any other country in the world.
In thirty-five years the trade of New South Wales has increased four-fold, her revenue five-
fold, her railway earnings ten-fold, and her population three-fold. Great development is

taking place along the whole range of the agricultural, pastoral, and industrial activities of the
State, and this development and expansion will provide improved home markets and increased
facilities for reaching the foreign consumer. Every immigrant who takes up land and enters
upon the work of production pushes on the material prosperity of the State, in which he himself
shares. Though the pastoral and agricultural industries are by far the most valuable in the
State, there are other resources of the most important character, which have a considerable
influence upon the fortunes of the country. The mineral resources of the State are almost
boundless. There are limitless coalfields, both on the coast and inland ; immense iron deposits ;
the marvellous silver-zinc-lead lodes of Broken Hill, the wealth of which is fabulous ; rich
copper and tin ores, distributed over very wide areas ; several important goldfields ; opal and
diamond mines ; and some of the choicest marbles in the world. Other valuable minerals
found in the State include platinum, cobalt, nickel, manganese, antimony, kerosene shale,
emeralds, turquoise, and sapphires. During 1905 the value of the minerals won in New South
Wales was £6.812,126, this being an increase of £592,075 over the return for the previous
year.

Government, being placed on a thoroughly sound basis, and with iron and coal in abundance,
and a most diversified range of raw materials, natural and produced, New South Wales must
become one of the great manufacturing countries of the world. In 1905 the value of raw
materials was increased locally by manufacture by over £10,000,000.
As a reference to the chapter on the mineral resources of the State will show, there are
vast deposits of exceedingly valuable iron ore in New South Wales. Some of these deposits are
close to immense coalfields and others are not far distant, the situation being so favourable
that the iron ore, limestone, and all the requirements for making iron can be delivered to the
vicinity of the coal more
cheaply than at any other
place in the world. The
coal in closest proximity to
the iron ore is at Lithgow
on the Western Railway
line, just beyond the Blue
Mountains. Already there
are extensive iron-works at
Lithgow; but preparations
are being made to con-
siderably expand the in-
dustry. The New South
Wales Government has
given a contract to William

Sandford, Ltd., for a supply of all the iron required by tlie various Government Departments
for seven years. In consequence of making this contract Mr. Sandford has arranged to erect a
modern blast furnace, steel converters, and rolling mills, and has engaged expert leading
workmen in England to supervise the work. The iron industry will thus be placed on a sound
footing, and the New South Wales finished product will he able to compete with the imported
article. This development is expected to have an important effect on the industries of the
country.
The timber resources of the State are exceedingly valuable, and a great industry will
be built upon them. The hardwoods of the State are superior to most other for wood-paving
purposes, and have earned a world-wide reputation. There is a considerable export trade
now in existence, and there is great promise of expansion, because time is telling in favour
of the New South Wales woods. The more the outside world knows of them, the greater
becomes the demand, and the more prosperous grows the timber trade of the State. Nearly

The Government of New South Wales is similar to that of other British Colonies—
democratic and stable. Its institutions are the freest in the world ; the solicitude of the
administration for the producer is almost paternal, and the conditions of life are most com-
fortable.
There is no church endowment in New South Wales. At the census of 1901, 4fi per
cent, of the population were members of the Church of England, 25 per cent, were Roman
Catholics, 9 per cent, were Presbyterians, and 10 per cent, were Methodists.
A system of advances of money to settlers by the State is in vogue, and has been found
to be very beneficial to the producer who may be struggling under adverse circumstances ;
and in times of misfortune, caused by bush-fire or other misadventure, the Government not
infrequently comes to the aid of the farmer by advancing seed wheat, or in some other appro-
priate manner. The settler will find every encouragement to succeed, and, given a healthy
determination, allied with pluck and perseverance, the man who takes up a farm anywhere
inside the 20-inch rain-belt of New South Wales should steadily progress.
So productive is the soil of New South Wales, and so wide are the ranges
of climate to be found within its borders, that the State is capable of
producing in abundance everything essential for the comfortable sustenance
of human life. Not only is New South Wales independent of other countries
for the principal articles of the food supply of her people, but vast quantities

of wheat, flour, meat, and butter are annually exported. When the comparatively high rate
of wages is taken into account, the prices are decidedly low, and meat and other classes of food,
which in other countries are regarded as luxuries, are in New South Wales consumed freely
even by the poorest of the community. Each person, on an average, consumes during the
course of a year 2G9 lb. of meat (151 lb. of beef, 106 lb. of mutton, and 12 lb. of pork), 238 lb.
of flour, 178 lb. of potatoes, 109 lb. of sugar, 21 lb. of butter, 10 lb. of rice, 6 lb. of oatmeal,
4 lb. of cheese, and 7 lb. of tea.


Of wheat, the 9,000,000 bushels that are required for home consumption for food are
all supplied from the wheat farms of the State, and a large surplus remains for export. The
consumption of meat is very large, and in this respect also New South ales would be indepen-
dent of other States and countries, were it not for the fact that her people prefer beef to mutton,
and this at present necessitates the importation of stock to cope with the demand for this
class of meat. A certain quantity of bacon and ham is also imported. Of potatoes about
2,500,000 cwt. are consumed annually, of which nearly one-half is grown locally, the remainder
being provided by neighbouring States. The sugar consumption is enormous, and of the total
of about 66,200 tons required annually nearly one-third is supplied locally by the farmers of
the North Coast district.
[ANDRA HOMESTEAD.
The average consumption per head of intoxicants in New South Wales remains now
at about the same level as ten years ago, and represents a considerable decrease from the figures
for previous decades. The actual alcohol (proof spirit) consumed on an average by each
inhabitant in the course of a year now amounts to‘a little over 2 gallons, as opposed to nearly
3 gallons in 1891, and the annual expenditure per inhabitant has decreased from about £4 (ss.
in the latter year to under £3 ss. at the present time. The total expenditure on alcoholic
liquors is now actually less, with a population of over a million and a half, than it was in 1891.
when the inhabitants were fewer by 372,500 persons. The annual consumption per head now
is : —Spirits 078 gallons, wine (H5B gallons, and beer 900 gallons ; so that the New South
Welshman drinks decidedly less spirits than his brother in the United Kingdom, rather more
wine, and less than a third as much beer.


The annual expenditure per head of population has been estimated at
£4O. Of this amount, about one-third (or £l4) is spent on food, one-eighth
(or £5) on clothing, and one-tenth (or £4) on tobacco and intoxicants. It
would be difficult, in small compass, to give any accurate idea of the average

for the whole State, as the prices vary considerably in different localities. But the following
figures represent the average retail prices in Sydney of some of the principal food commodities :

considerably, and ranges from 4s. to 9s. per cwt. ; the average for the last ten years has
been about 7s. House-rent in Sydney and its suburbs, for dwellings occupied by the labouring
classes, ranges from 7s. to 10s. per week for three-roomed dwellings, to about 10s. for those
with four rooms, and correspondingly higher rates for increased accommodation.
Private Wealth
and its
Distribution.
The value of private wealth in New South Wales is estimated at over
£375,750.000. or between £250 and £2OO per head. Relatively speaking,
the distribution of private wealth is very wide, and is indeed without parallel
in any other country in the world, more than one person in every six being
a property owner. The total private income of the inhabitants of New
South Wales has been estimated at between £05,000,000 and £70,000,000 annually, or over
£45 per inhabitant. It has been estimated that of the total male breadwinners in New South
Wales about 6 6 per cent, have incomes in excess of £2OO a year. The average annual income
of the male breadwinners who receive less than £2OO per annum is £lO3.

of old-age pensions was inaugurated in 1901. Under this scheme, any person who is 65 years
of age, has resided in New South Wales for twenty-five years, and satisfies the conditions as

independent income or property, the pension is reduced by £1 for every £1 of the pensioner’s

Persons over 60 but under 65 are entitled to pensions if incapacitated by sickness or injury
from earning their livelihood. The annual cost to the State of the old-age pensions amounts
to about £500,000, and in December, 1905, 20,737 persons were receiving pensions.

neglected children is entrusted to the State Children’s Relief Board, who have pursued the

The criminal statistics of New South Wales show that for a long period
crime has been decreasing in a most satisfactory way. During the period
1880-84 the number of apprehensions per 100,000 of the population was
5,1-10, and this had sunk to 2,774 during 1900-04 ; and though the population

had in the interval swelled by more than half-a-million, the actual number of apprehensions
per annum had decreased by nearly 2,500. In the vast majority of cases, of course, these
apprehensions represent comparatively trivial matters, which were dealt with summarily by a
magistrate ; but when one turns to the statistics of the committals for trial, comprising the
more serious classes of offences, the improvement is stdl more noticeable, During the period
between 1875-79 and 1900-1904 the average annual committals per 100,000 of the population
decreased from 238 to 97 ; and fewer persons are now committed for trial annually than
twenty-five years ago, when the population was less than half its present number,


The people of New South Wales are amply provided with parks and public
recreation reserves. In the city of Sydney 696 acres (or 24 per cent, of the
whole city) is devoted to parks, squares, and public gardens ; and there is

from the metropolis, consisting of nearly 34,000 acres, surrounding the picturesque bay of Port
Hacking ; and 10 miles to the north of Sydney lies the Kuring-gai Chase, comprising 35,300
acres of beautiful forest country. An area of 218 acres at Kurnell, on Botany Bay, the historic
landing place of Captain Cook, was rescued from private ownership, proclaimed as a recreation
reserve, and dedicated to the people for all time, chiefly by the efforts of the present Premier,
Mr. J. H. Carruthers. In the country districts, reserves, extending in some cases over 1,000,000
acres, have been proclaimed as temporary commons, whilst considerable areas have been from
time to time dedicated as permanent commons attached to townships, which are otherwise
well provided with parks and reserves.
The immigrant —and especially the Englishman—who is leaving the
shores of the United Kingdom for New South Wales, is coming to a
country whose legal system closely reproduces that of the land from which
he is departing, and whose laws are in great measure precisely identical

South Wales.
with those under which he has hitherto lived. In 1828 the whole of the law of England,
which was then applicable to the conditions of the Colony, was brought into force in New South
Wales, and though Imperial legislation passed since that date has not affected New South
Wales law (except in comparatively few special cases), many Imperial statutes have been
adopted by the local legislature, and the principles of the English common law have, by their
very nature, followed in New South Wales a course of develop-
ment exactly identical with that which has obtained in England,
except in cases where local enactments have intervened to break
the continuity. The land law of New South Wales (apart from
the statutes dealing with the alienation of Crown lands) is very
similar to that of England. One important difference is that
in cases of intestacy a person’s land goes to his next of kin, in
the same way as his goods and chattels, instead of descending
to the heir as in England. The “ Torrens” system of land regis-
tration, which was introduced as from the beginning of 1863,
has proved very popular. The system is somewhat similar to
that which obtains in the county and city of London under the
ICE AT MOUNT KOSCIUSKO.
English Land Transfer Acts, 1875 and 1897, except that it is quite optional for private
owners to “ bring the land under the Act,” or leave it under the old system, as they choose.
The great advantage which is derived from registration lies in the certainty which attaches
to registered titles, and the facility with which registered land can be transferred or otherwise
dealt with, a single sheet of parchment (the “ certificate of title ”) being substituted for all
the bulky deeds of the old system. Copyhold tenure and game laws are alike unknown in New
South Wales. In 1902 an Act was passed by virtue of which an illegitimate child, whose parents
afterwards intermarry, is by virtue of such marriage, legitimated as from birth, provided that
at the child’s birth there was no legal impediment to its parents’ marriage, and that the child
is registered after the marriage by the father. Marriage with a deceased wife’s sister is legal

New South Wales offers an unrivalled field for the tourist, holiday-maker,

the Alpine streams, or to the lazy warmth of the tropical fringe touching the Queensland
border. With a death-rate of only 1013 per thousand it will be readily recognised that the
climate is one of the healthiest in the world, and already several portions of New South Wales
have achieved considerable reputation as health resorts. There are a number of springs and
hot-water baths in different districts, among others the thermal spring at Yarrangobilly Caves,
the chalybeate spring at Mittagong, and the Morce artesian baths, with a temperature of 114
decrees, the latter being credited with the power to cure rheumatism. In more than one
district trout fishing equal to that of Scotland may be obtained, and in many parts of the
country there is splendid shooting. Poets have sung the beauties of Sydney Harbour, the
magnificent estuary of Port Jackson, where the infant Commonwealth was cradled over a
century ago, and which is generally admitted by travellers to be the finest harbour in the
world. The Blue Mountains, 40 miles west of Sydney, present some extraordinarily fine
scenerv in the shape of rugged gorges, profound depths, immense valleys, waterfalls losing
themselves in mist, and views merging into indefinable distance. In these mountains are
situated the Jenolan Caves, said to be the finest wonder caverns in the world. Ihe caves

of untold ages, underground streams have hollowed out the caverns. The wealth of stalactites,
shawls, and calcite crystals in the caves call up to the minds of tourists visions of some delightful
palaces in fairyland. There are other caves in the southern portion of the State, situated in
the same limestone belt, at Wombeyan and at Yarrangobilly. The latter may be viewed in
a round trip which includes a visit to the summit of Mount Kosciusko, the highest peak in
Australia. Some typical Australian coaching will be enjoyed on this tour. Snow-clad
Kosciusko presents the oldest land surfaces known to geologists on the globe, and is intensely
interesting on this account to the student, while its wild and craggy ridges dipping steeply to
almost fathomless gorges, and its extravagance of magnificent panoramic views which extend,
owing to the clear Australian atmosphere, for scores of miles in every direction, make the
visit one of surpassing wonder to the most careless tourist. A feature of interest on this tour
is that the traveller may ascend to the very summit of the snow-clad mountain on horseback.
There are many of the districts of New South Wales worthy of inspection by the tourist,
among them being the beautiful Illawarra. where sea, jungle, and mountain meet, and which
contains the world-famed Rulli Pass ; the Hawkesbury, known to tourists as the “ Rhine of
Australia,” which is quite close to the city of Sydney ; the New England tableland, with its
well-stocked trout streams ; the Nowra - Moss Vale district, with its magnificent gorges and
delightful mountain drives ; and the wonderful North Coast, with the “ first flush of the tropics
in its blood,” and with a climate so marvellous that sugar-cane and English fruits flourish
one beside the other. (Jood, cheap, and easy communication is an outstanding feature of the
New South Wales tourist system. Splendid sport is available at numberless places for the
fowler and the angler. New South Wales is the land of real holiday and enjoyment. The
hotel accommodation is good and cheap, Sydney’s best hotels being equal to the best in London,
and their rates being very considerably below English charges.

CHAPTER III.
Physical Features.
EW South Wales is the mother State Australian
Commonwealth, and was the first portion of the
continent to be occupied by settlers of the British race.
It fills about one-ninth of the continent, and is by far
the richest of the States in pastoral, agricultural, and
mineral wealth.
The State covers an area of 310,700 square miles,
and is thus nearly three times the total size of the
BY J. M. TAYLOR. M.A., LL.B.
(department of public instruction).
British Islands. It lies between Queensland and Victoria, and within its limits are included
the best land, the most charming scenery, and the most important rivers of Australia. On
the east its extensive coast line is washed by the waters of the Pacific Ocean, and the State
stretches thence inland for nearly 700 miles to the eastern border of South Australia. The
coast, whose appearance in 1770 delighted the eyes of its first explorers—Captain Cook and
Sir Joseph Banks—consists of a succession of frowning cliffs, low grassy promontories, and
sparkling sandy beaches, broken at intervals by picturesque bays and roomy river estuaries.
The absence of dangerous reefs and currents along the shores render, the navigation of New
South Wales waters an easy task for the mariner, while lighthouses have been erected on
all the more prominent headlands as a safeguard against shipping disasters.
New South Wales possesses several fine natural harbours, one of which —
Port Jackson, on whose shores the city of Sydney is situated —stands
unsurpassed among the ports of the world for size, beauty, and shipping
facilities. Visitors from all quarters of the globe have written enthusias-
tically of the natural beauties of Sydney Harbour. The late Anthony
Harbours
and
Estuaries.
Trollope, for example, describes it as “ so inexpressibly lovely that it makes a man ask himself
whether it would not be worth his while to move his household gods to the eastern coast of
Australia, in order that he might look on it as long as he can look at anything.” Among other
breaks in the coast —Port Stephens, Broken Bay, Botany Bay, and Twofold Bay, are little


inferior to Port Jackson, while several small ports, estuaries, and roadsteads afford abundant
facilities for shipping, and are safe harbours of refuge against the perils of the sea.
The mouths of several of the coastal rivers are sometimes hampered by sand accumu-
lations known as bars; but this evil has been largely minimised by systematic dredging, carried
out by the Government, by whom, also, extensive training-walls have been constructed in
many places to increase the scouring effect of the tides and river outflow, and thus remove
at length these hindrances to shipping.
Several lakes or lagoons are met with along the coast. Besides rendering this part of
the country more picturesque and increasing the number of tourist resorts, these fine sheets
of water are, in almost every case, the seats of thriving fishing industries.
THE GROSE VALLEY, BLUE MOUNTAINS
Within the limits of New South Wales may be seen some of the oldest land surfaces
of the whole world—many parts of the country as it exists to-day having stood high and dry
when hundreds of feet of restless ocean rolled over the highest shoulders of the Alps and
Himalayas. The State of New South Wales falls into three well-marked natural sections :
(i) a narrow coastal strip of well-watered, undulating country; (ii) the tablelands, running


from north to south throughout the whole length of
the State, and forming portion of a belt of highlands
skirting the eastern and south-eastern portions of the
continent; and (iii) the western plains, which extend
west and north from the foothills of the tablelands to
the borders of South Australia and Queensland.
The coast district is a strip of
hilly, well-watered, and generally
fertile country, with an average
width of between 30 and 40 miles.
The
Coastal Strip.
In the Hunter River Valley—its widest portion—it
stretches back at least 150 miles from the ocean,
while at Clifton, about 40 miles south of Sydney,
the tableland comes to within a few yards of the
Pacific, from which, however, it gradually recedes as it works south. In doing so it skirts
the dairy-farming and coal-producing district of Illawarra—a much-frequented tourist resort,
remarkable for its grandly frowning cliffs and creaming beaches, as well as for the almost tropical
luxuriance of its stately palms, tree-ferns, and other kinds of abundant native vegetation.
Many mountain spurs stretch eastward from the Main Dividing Range towards the
ocean. All of these, besides serving as boundaries between the several coastal river valleys,
take their share in the work of intercepting and wringing dry the vapour-laden winds'that
blow landwards from the Pacific. They thus help to make the coastal district the well-watered
fertile region that it is for the most part, with an annual rainfall, varying from 40 inches in
the extreme south to 70 inches in the north. Among the more important of these lateral
ranges are the Macpherson Range, a rugged mountain wall which serves as part of the
boundary between New South Wales and Queensland ; the Macleay, Hastings, Mount Royal,
and Hunter Ranges further south ; while, west of Sydney are the Blue Mountains, which
broaden out into the well-known rugged plateau, whose delightfully invigorating atmosphere
and picturesque surroundings attract thousands of visitors from all parts of Australia during
the summer months.
The rivers belonging to the seaboard of New South Wales spring either from the Great
Dividing Range —the main watershed of the State —or from its easterly extending spurs.
They are all permanent streams ; many of them are short, the most notable exceptions being
the Clarence (240 miles), Macleay (200), Hunter (200), Hawkesbury (330), and the Shoalhaven
(260) —all fine streams, navigable for varying distances for fairly large steamers, and skirted
in their lower courses by low-lying alluvial flats of great depth and fertility. After periods
of sudden and exceptionally heavy rainfall the whole of the coastal rivers are liable to overflow,
sometimes doing damage to crops and settlements. Although these inundations often work
havoc while they last, nevertheless, the top-dressing of silt which they leave behind when


the flood-waters recede greatly increases the crop-producing capacity of the alluvial lands
along the river banks.
The greater part of the coast district has been brought under cultivation. Dairy-
farming has gradually become the leading industry throughout the greater part of the coast;
but in addition to this sugar-cane is grown on the warm northern alluvial lands skirting the
Tweed, Richmond, and Clarence Rivers. Maize, oats, and lucerne are the chief crops farther
south, as far as the Hunter ; while in the Parramatta and Ryde districts —contiguous to
Sydney—oranges, lemons, and stone fruits are extensively grown, both for local consumption
and for export. In the parts of the coast district lying close to the tablelands, much fertile,
heavily timbered land—now unoccupied save by dense forests of hardwood—will probably,
in the near future, be brought under tillage.
But valuable as are the agricultural and pastoral resources of the coast district, another
great material heritage of the people of New South Wales is the magnificent series of coal
CAMEL TRAIN CARRYING WOOL IN THE FAR WEST.
deposits of this part of Australia. Underlying the whole tract of country, extending from
Port Stephens to the Clyde River, and stretching in a south-westerly direction past Moss Vale,
and westerly under the Blue Mountains to Lithgow, are splendid seams of the finest coal for
steam and gas-making purposes.
The presence of these vast coal deposits marks out unmistakably this part of New
South Wales as the great future manufacturing region of Australia, with Sydney as its natural
centre. At present the chief coal ports of the State are Newcastle and Wollongong —the
industrial centres of the Hunter and Illawarra districts, —while large quantities of Lithgow
coal are sent by rail to Sydney for shipment. In the Clarence-Kichmond district, in the
north-eastern portion of the State, there are valuable coal-seams also ; but they are, as yet,
unworked on account of their distance from rail and seaport.


The indigenous vegetation of the coast is, as a rule, varied and luxuriant, but with
the march of settlement, it is necessarily giving place by degrees to pasture grasses. Over
wide areas, especially in the deep gullies near the heads of the various coastal rivers, and in
the neighbourhood of numerous old-time basaltic overflows, the hill slopes are clothed with a
luxuriant, semi-tropical natural drapery—stately palms and tree-ferns, acacias, gums, banksias,
and fig-trees, uniting to form a picture charming, not only to the tourist and botanist, but to
the practical, prosaic searcher after rich grazing and agricultural lands.
Inland from the coastal strip lie the Tablelands —a plateau tract forming
portion of a more extensive series of uplands which run parallel to the coast
from North Queensland to the centre of Victoria, with a southerly-extending
offshoot dipping under Bass Strait and reappearing in the island State of
The
Tablelands.
Tasmania. The tablelands vary from about 30 to over 100 miles in width, and are broken
into two distinct sections —the northern and the southern —by the far-extending water-worn
valleys of the Hunter —Goulburn, and Peel Rivers. They serve as a platform along which
winds the Great Dividing Range, the main water-parting of the country. This well-marked
mountain mass runs from north to south through the whole length of the State. It bears
different names in different parts, e.g., the New England Range, in the far north ; the
Liverpool Range, immediately north of the Hunter-Goulburn Valley ; the Main Range, west
of the Hunter-Goulburn and Hawkesbury River Valleys; the Cullarin Range, in the
Goulburn district; the Gourock and Monaco Ranges, further south ; while the highest and
most southerly portion, containing Mount Kosciusko (7,328 feet), the highest peak in the
continent, is called the Muniong Range. Steep, frowning precipices, as a rule, mark the
eastern face of both tablelands, while their slope to the plains of the interior is long and
gradual. As a result, many of the coastal rivers are swiftly-flowing torrents, while long,
sluggish courses are the most marked feature of the western streams, all of which belong to
the Murray-Darling river system.

downs —are met with on both tablelands.
They are devoted mainly to sheep-farming,
wheat-growing, and the cultivation of fruit.
A prominent feature of the Southern
Tableland is its valleys —a series of huge
gorges, resembling the far-famed canons of the
United States. Among the most notable of
these depressions are the Grose, Kanimbla,
and Jamieson Valleys in the Blue Mountains,
and the Valley of Burragorang further south ;
and it is interesting to note that all of them
have been hollowed out in the course of untold ages by the persistent action of running water.
The views afforded from the most frequented points of vantage on the bounding cliffs of the
Blue Mountain valleys are truly magnificent. The cliffs forming their sides are composed
of horizontal strata of iron-stained sandstone, and “ are so absolutely vertical that in many
places a person standing on the edge and throwing down a stone can see it strike the trees
in the abyss below. . . If we imagine a winding harbour, with its deep water surrounded
by bold cliff-like shores, to be laid dry, and a forest of graceful tree-ferns, sassafras, and
giant eucalypti ” to spring up on its sandy bottom, we should have the appearance and
structure they exhibit. Into these chasms tumble several mountain torrents, many of which
become lost in gauzy mist before reaching the bottom, while around nearly all of them the
scenery is wild and romantic. The best-known of these charming cascades are those of
Govett’s Leap, Katoomba, Leura, and Wentworth Falls—all within easv reach of Sydney bv
rail. Not only do the Blue Mountains possess the charm of beautiful scenery, but their cool
invigorating atmosphere attracts thousands of visitors from the warm coast district during
the summer months.
Both tablelands are crossed from south to north by railways, and in the course of a
train journey on either of them, delightfully varying landscapes are met with. In some places
the mountains consist of sandstone strata, monotonous in their regularity, in others wild
granite masses in all stages of weathering. At intervals a sudden change to a luxuriant
vegetation indicates the presence of decomposing basalt, every sheet of which is an ancient
lava stream, pointing to a time when volcanic fires smirched the hillsides of Eastern Australia,
whose convulsions shook the continent of that period from end to end, and whose escaping
gases and ashes darkened the air. The decomposing products of these eruptions have been
responsible for the marvellously rich patches now met with, for example, in the New England
district, along the eastern and western flanks of both tablelands, and even farther away
in the Gwydir-Namoi black-soil plains, whose very richness and depth render the tasks of
teamsters crossing them in wet weather, with heavily-laden wool and grain waggons from the
sheep runs and wheat-fields of the north-west, a most trying one.


Throughout the tableland between Bathurst and the Kosciusko Plateau there stretches
an extensive limestone belt, in which occur the well-known Jenolan, Wombeyan, and
Yarrangobilly Caves. Towards its southern extremity, the tableland country becomes wild
and broken, and not far from the Victorian border it is capped by a group of peaks among
which Mount Kosciusko, the highest mountain in the continent, takes first rank. The name
Kosciusko is due to Count Strezlecki, an accomplished Polish traveller, who ascended and
explored the surrounding region in 1840. In his view the crest of the peak he climbed
bore a striking resemblance to the tumulus erected at Cracow over the remains of his famous
countryman, the Polish patriot Kosciusko. This hoary, weather-beaten crag is probably one of
the oldest land surfaces in the world, and, grand as it is to-day, in ages past it must have been
incomparably grander, for it is, in truth, but the abraded stump of an old-time majestic volcano,
whose fires have long been extinct, while the glaciers that once chiselled its hill sides and carved
out the beds of the Kosciusko tarns of to-day, are an almost forgotten factor in the moulding
of the continent, as we now know it. Mount Kosciusko was standing high and dry in the
full strength of mountainhood, when in recent geological time a deep sea extended through
RAILWAY BRIDGE OVER THE HAWKESBURY RIVER.


Central Australia, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Southern Ocean, washing against the
present foothills of Eastern Australia, and when hundreds of feet of deep blue waters covered
the topmost hill slopes of the loftiest mountains that Europe and Asia can boast. At the
time of writing a progressive Government has undertaken the task of cutting a roadway
right to the summit of Kosciusko, in order that its geological wonders and scenic marvels may
be brought more easily within the reach of the tourist. It is possible now to ride to the top
of the mountain on horseback, and the completion of the road, which may be looked for in the
course of a few years, will enable the visitor to sit in a vehicle and be driven almost to the
summit of Australia’s highest mountain.
The whole of New South Wales lying west of the tablelands consists of
a vast plain, with a gradual slope towards the Darling River, beyond which
the country stretches with a gradual rise to the borders of Queensland and
South Australia. Over wide areas the Western Plains are almost as level

Plains.
as a bowling green, so that the task of constructing the numerous railways that serve this
part of the State, was beset with practically no engineering difficulties. Trifling elevations and
belts of scrub-land occur at intervals, and the only elevations of any importance are the silver-
bearing Barrier Ranges, close to the South Australian frontier, and the Grey Range, further
north. The rainfall varies from about 10 inches in the extreme west, to about 24 inches
in the portion immediately west of the tablelands. In consequence of these conditions
the far west is only suitable, without irrigation, for sheep-farming, while the more easterly
portion, stretching from Albury north to Moree, is the huge wheat belt of splendid pro-
ductiveness, destined to make New South Wales one of the greatest grain producers in the
world.
The soil of the plains consists almost entirely of alluvial deposits, which have, in the
course of ages, been carried down from the tablelands by the rivers, and spread over its surface.
Some portions—notably the black-soil plains in the north-eastern section of the region, are
among the deepest and most fertile alluvial soils in the whole world. In favourable seasons
the plains are clothed with rich natural grasses, on which millions of sheep are depastured,

conserving the waste water will have been satisfactorily solved, the agricultural possibilities of
the far west will be very great, for water alone is wanted to make that part of the State
highly suitable for the growing of fruits and vegetables.


Within the Western Plains occurs the famous Broken Hill region, one of the most extensive
and productive silver-fields of the world ; the rich Cobar copper-mining district; and the
White Cliffs opal-fields, which yield some of the finest noble opal as yet found anywhere.
AN ILLAWARRA SCENE.
The rivers of the plains belong to one great system—that of the Murray-
Darling. They are in many cases often almost dry for many months of the
year, and notwithstanding their far-extending catchment areas, are narrow
and shallow, except when in Hood, and in many cases flow in summer for
The Murray-
Darling System.
considerable distances, more through than above the extensive accumulations of sand,
shingle, and drift which compose their beds. The fall of the western rivers is but slight—not
more than about 3 feet per mile, —and their courses are long and sluggish, while, taken in
comparison with the streams of the coastal district, their volume is by no means great. Floods
occur at intervals in the rivers draining the plains, but as flooded conditions are very rare,
most of the streams consist often of a chain of waterholes for the greater part of the vear,
while hardly one of the longer tributaries of the Darling reaches the main stream except
during periods of continuously heavy rainfall.


The Murray-Darling river basin includes the whole of the western portion of New South
Wales, stretches northward far into Queensland, and embraces a very large portion of northern
Victoria. The head streams of the Murray spring from the Kosciusko Plateau, where, owing
to a large and constant rainfall and the accumulation of snow on the hill-slopes for nine months
of the year, an abundant water supply is available. For this reason the Murray has a greater
volume than any other Australian river, and it has never been known by either blacks or whites
to have stopped running. The stream is navigable for small river steamers as far as the town of
Albury, a distance of over 1,400 miles from its mouth. The Murray receives the united waters
of the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan Rivers —two large streams draining the important pastoral
and wheat-growing district of Riverina—while lower down its course it is joined by the Darling.
This long Nile-like river carries to the sea the waters of several important streams which, taken
together, drain an extensive basin, stretching from central New South Wales northward into
Queensland. The Darling, like most large Australian rivers, is known by different names in
different parts of its course, the term Darling being only applied to that part of the river below
the Bogan junction. Its longest head stream is the Condamine, which has its source in the
Darling Downs, a rich pastoral district in Queensland, whence it sweeps in an almost semi-
circular fashion into New South Wales, which it enters under the name of the Culgoa. About
20 miles above the important stock-trucking railway town of Bourke, the Culgoa receives the
united waters of the Barwon, Bogan, Macquarie—Castlereagh, Namoi, and Gwydir, and thence
pursues a south-westerly course, under the name of the Darling, till it joins the Murray at the
township of Wentworth. A remarkable circumstance in connection with the Darling is the
fact that from the Culgoa junction to its confluence with the Murray this great watercourse
has not a single permanent tributary—the Paroo terminating in swamps about 40 miles north-
west of Wilcannia, and, like the Warrego, only reaching the main river during great floods.
Its banks, too, are in many places higher than the surrounding plains ; indeed, the river
bed itself, though from 30 to 40 feet below the bank, is in some places but little lower than the
general level of the adjacent country, so that during floods the river banks are often the only
dry lands visible for miles. During periods of
long-continued dry weather the river dwindles
above Menindie to a succession of reaches, with
little or no flow between them, and in some places
exists only as a chain of waterholes. During
freshets the Darling is navigable for small river
steamers as far as Walgett, distant 2,345 miles
from the sea, and its total length has been
estimated at 3,282 miles. Almost all the plain

country within its basin is occupied by squatters as sheep runs, and much of the station pro-

The upper portions of most of the tributaries of the Darling and Murray run through
gold-bearing districts, and in several parts of the Macquarie dredging for gold in the river bed
is carried on as a payable industry.

CHAPTER IV.
Government and Finance.
Government of the Commonwealth—Government of New South Wales—Common-
wealth and State Franchise—Naturalisation- Local Government in New South
Wales—Commonwealth and State Finance.
BY F. R. JORDAN, B.A.
'NEW South Wales, like its fellow States of the Common-
Vill j wealth of Australia, was, prior to 1901, a British
self-governing Colony. The question of the union of
lli-V* the whole of Australia had, however, long engaged
public attention, and after many years of discussion
a measure was prepared by Australian statesmen in
1891, providing for the federation of these Colonies.
This formed the groundwork of the Constitution Bill,
which was eventually adopted in 1899 by the Colonies
of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South
Australia, and Tasmania, and by Western Australia in 1900, and was transmitted to the
Imperial Parliament, by which it was passed into law under the name of “ The Commonwealth
of Australia Constitution Act.’ By virtue of this Act the Colonies of the Australian
Continent and Tasmania have been, since Ist January, 1901, joined in a federal union called
“ The Commonwealth of Australia,” the constituent parts being no longer termed “Colonies”
but “ States.” British New Guinea was transferred to the control of the Commonwealth in
1901.
Except in so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is expressly empowered to modify
certain provisions, the Constitution may not be altered in any respect unless the proposed
change be approved in a majority of the States by a majority of the electors voting therein,
and by a majority of all the electors voting throughout the Commonwealth, after having been
previously approved by the Federal Parliament.
The Constitution provides that the seat of government of the Common-
wealth shall be situated in New South Wales (but not within 100 miles of
Sydney), and that until a site be chosen for the capital the Federal Parlia-
ment shall meet in Melbourne. The matter of the choice of a site has alreadv

engaged the attention of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, but pending definite action in
this direction, both Houses continue to sit in Melbourne.


The Commonwealth of Australia forms an integral part of the British
Empire. The Parliament of the United Kingdom has sovereign power over
every part of the King’s dominions, and political relations with foreign
countries (including those of peace and war) are solely within the control
of the British Government, But, just as, prior to federation, full powers of
The Common-
wealth and the
Empire.
self-government in local matters had been enjoyed by each separate Colony, so now each State
retains all its former powers of legislation and administration, except in certain matters, over
which exclusive control has been surrendered by each and all of the States to the Common-
wealth ; and the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth and of the Parliaments of
the different States, taken together, extend to the making of laws for the peace, order, and good
government of Australia in all cases whatsoever.
GENERAL POST OFFICE, SYDNEY.


Authority is divided between the Commonwealth and its constituent
States. The Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate in a variety
of matters which it was deemed desirable should be controlled by a central
authority, and should be uniform for the whole of Australia. In certain
cases its powers are exclusive. The Commonwealth alone may maintain

wealth and its
States.
military and naval forces and impose customs and excise duties (although it is provided in
the Constitution that trade between the different States shall be absolutely free). In certain
matters the powers of the Commonwealth and of the States are concurrent. Both, for example,
may make laws dealing with bankruptcy, divorce, copyright, old-age pensions, and immigra-
tion ; but if State and Commonwealth legislation conflict, the Commonwealth law prevails.
Over all matters in which power to legislate is not by the Constitution given to the Common-
wealth. the States have sole control; so that the Parliament of New South Wales has the
exclusive right to make laws relating, for example, to public lands, education, internal trade,
and generally for the good government of New South Wales in all cases whatsoever, except as
above indicated.
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
The system of government of Commonwealth and States alike is parliamentarv, and
is modelled on the institutions of the United Kingdom.
The legislative power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Parliament, which consists
of the King (who is represented by the Governor-General), the Senate, and the House of
Representatives. The executive power is vested in the King, and is exercisable by the Governor-
General as the King’s representative.
The Governor-General is appointed by the Crown. His legislative
functions are exercised with respect to proposed laws as finally shaped
and adopted by the Federal Legislature. Such Bills are presented to the
Governor-General for his assent in the King’s name, on receiving which

they become law throughout the Commonwealth. The Governor-
General may, however, withhold his assent, or may reserve anv
Bill for the King’s pleasure. He may return any Bill, with
suggested amendments, to the House in which it originated.
The Crown may also disallow any law within one year from
the date on which it was assented to by the Governor-General.
The Governor-General’s executive functions are exercised on the
advice of his responsible Ministers. Various specific powers are
vested in him by the Constitution : he may summon, prorogue,
and dissolve Parliament; and he has the command-in-chief of
the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth. The
Governor-General has also been invested by the Crown with the
THE BLUE LAKE.


prerogative of mercy in the case of offences committed against the laws of the Common-
wealth. But all these powers are exercised on the advice of his Ministers ; and even in
giving effect to those which may be called discretionary (such as the granting of a dissolution
of Parliament), it is necessary for the Governor-General, even if he do not accept the advice
of the Ministry of the day, to procure a Ministry which will accept responsibility to Parliament
for the course which he adopts. The Governor-General is himself responsible only to the
Imperial Government for his official acts.
In the Senate, each of the six States is represented by six members, who
are elected by the people of the State voting as one electorate. Senators
hold office for six years, half retiring at the end of every three years. This

arrangement is designed to make the Senate a permanent body, though provision is made
for its dissolution as a whole, in conjunction with the House of Representatives, in the event
of a deadlock occurring between the two Houses.
Each State returns to the House of Representatives a number of members
proportionate to its population, the minimum number for any original State
being 5. In the 1906 distribution, out of a total of 75 members, New South
Wales has 27 representatives, Victoria coming next with 22. This House
The House of
Representatives.
endures for three years from its election, unless it be sooner dissolved.
The Constitution provides that the total number of members in the House of Repre-
sentatives shall be as nearly as practicable twice the number of the members of the Senate.
Members of each House receive remuneration at the rate of £-100 per annum.
The two Houses of the Federal Parliament have equal powers, except in the case of
money Bills. These must originate in the House of Representatives. Further, the Senate
may not amend Bills which impose taxation, or which provide for the ordinary annual services
of the Government; nor may it amend any Bill so as to increase any proposed charge on the
people. It may, however, suggest amendments in any of these cases ; and there is no direct
constitutional limit on its
Bills. The effect is to

tions, the two Houses be still irreconcilable, the Governor-General may convene a joint
sitting to settle the matter. It will be observed that at a joint sitting the members of the
House of Representatives, who represent the people of the Commonwealth on a strictly


population basis, will always outnumber, in the ratio of 2 to 1, the members of the Senate, in
which the States are represented equally, without respect to their populations. A Ministry,
therefore, which was supported by a substantial majority in the House of Representatives,
could bring considerable pressure to bear on a hostile Senate.
In the executive government, the cabinet system, similar in its general
features to that existing in the United Kingdom, prevails in the Common-
wealth as well as in the different States. The leader of the predominant
party in the Commonwealth Parliament, and the colleagues of his choice,

Executive Council (of which the Governor-General is President), and (at the present time)
one Minister without portfolio. No Minister may hold office for longer than three months
unless he is a member of either House of the Federal Parliament.
The judicial power of the Commonwealth is vested in a Federal Supreme
Court, called the High Court of Australia, and in the State Courts which
have been invested with federal jurisdiction. The High Court was constituted
by the Federal Parliament in 1903. It acts as a court of appeal from the
The

Supreme Courts of the different States, and also has original jurisdiction in certain matters,
including any arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation. No appeal
may be made from a judgment of the High Court to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council without the special leave of the latter; and no appeal may in any case be
made to the Privy Council from a decision of the High Court upon any question as
to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and its States,
or of two or more States, unless the permission of the High Court itself be obtained. The
right to appeal direct from the Supreme Court of any State to the Privy Council is still
preserved.


Commonwealth
Franchise.
Every natural born or naturalised British subject, who is 21 years of age,
and has lived in Australia for six months continuously, may have his name
placed on the electoral roll for the electoral division in which he lives, and
he is thereupon entitled to vote at the election of members of both Houses
of the Commonwealth Parliament. The franchise extends to women as well as men, and no
person has more than one vote. The Federal franchise is not enjoyed by aboriginal natives
of Australia, Asia, Africa, or the islands of the Pacific (except New Zealand), nor by persons
who are insane, or attainted of treason, or who have been convicted and are under sentence,
or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable by one year’s imprisonment. Any
adult who is entitled to vote for the election of members to the New South Wales Legislative
Assembly cannot be debarred from voting at Commonwealth elections.
The right to issue certificates of naturalisation in the Commonwealth is
now exclusively vested in the Federal Government. Any foreigner who
intends to settle in the Commonwealth, and has resided there continuously
Naturalisation.
for two years immediately prior to his application, may apply to the Governor-General for a
certificate of naturalisation, and the Governor-General may, at his discretion, grant the same,
on the oath of allegiance being taken by the applicant. Provision is also made for the naturalis-
ation in the Commonwealth of persons who have already been naturalised in the United
Kingdom. Aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands of the Pacific (except New Zealand)
are excluded from naturalisation.

THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
The present Constitution of the State of New South Wales depends on an Imperial
Statute which was passed in the year 1855, for the purpose of authorising the Queen to assent
to a Constitution Bill which had been prepared by the Legislature of the Colony (then consisting
of a single House). The New South Wales Parliament is empowered to alter or repeal any
of the provisions of the State Constitution.
The Governor of New South Wales is appointed by the Crown, and his
functions in the State resemble those of the Governor-General in the Com-
monwealth. The Governor assents, on the King’s behalf, to Bills passed
by the two Houses of the State Parliament; or he may withhold his assent,

such advice, should he see sufficient cause. Any such matter would, however, have to be
reported at once to the British Government. The Governor is responsible to the Crown alone
for his official acts.
There are two Houses in the State Parliament—the Legislative Council
and the Legislative Assembly—and its powers extend to the making of
laws for the good government of New South Wales in all cases whatsoever,

enacted by the King, with the advice and consent, and by the authority, of the two Houses.
The Legislative Council is a permanent body. It is not elective, and its members (at
present sixty-one in number) are appointed by the Governor for life.
The Legislative Assembly is elective, and now consists of ninety members, each of whom
receives £3OO per annum. Each Assembly endures for three years, unless sooner dissolved.

the New South Wales Constitution Act, although
it is provided that money Hills must originate
in the Legislative Assembly. Except in this
respect, the powers of the two Chambers in
dealing with legislation are equal ; but since the
Assembly is a representative body, it is upon
the confidence of that House that the Ministry
depends for its tenure of office.
The executive government of New South Wales is carried on by an
Executive Council, presided over by the Governor. The leader of the
predominant party in the Legislative Assembly, and colleagues chosen by
him, are appointed to the Executive Council by the Governor, and control
the great Departments of State. They hold office so long as they enjoy the confidence of
Parliament. The State Ministry is constituted as follows :—Colonial Treasurer, Colonial
Secretary, Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Secretary for Lands, Secretary for Public
Works, Minister of Public Instruction and Labour and Industry, Secretary for Mines and
Agriculture. There is also a Vice-President of the Executive Council, and (at the present
time) two Ministers without portfolio.
Every natural-born subject who is of age, and has resided in New South
Wales for one year, and within any electoral district for three months, is
entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Assembly.
Phis applies also to naturalised British subjects who have resided in New
South Wales for one year after naturalisation. The State is divided into

ninety electoral districts, each returning one member. Women as well as men are entitled
to the State franchise, and no one may exercise more than one vote. The following are
excluded from the franchise : —Persons in the naval or military service on full pay (except
militia or volunteers); insane persons; persons receiving aid from a public charity: persons
recently convicted of certain offences.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TN NEW SOUTH WALES.
The history of local government in New South Wales began with the incorporation
of the city of Sydney in 1842. This was followed by the formation of several district councils
in the country ; and legislation passed in 1858 and 1867 made possible the extension of local
government to the whole State.
Under the system which existed up to the end of 1905, the application of local govern-
ment to any part of the State depended entirely on the initiative of the residents. The
Municipalities Act, 1897, which deals with the whole matter, provides that the Governor may
constitute a municipality on receiving a petition from at least fifty persons who would, on its


formation, be liable to pay rates ; but the creation of any such municipality may be prevented
by a counter-petition of a greater number of persons who would be similarly liable. On the
formation of a municipality, occupiers, lessees, and owners of ratable property are entitled to
vote for the election of a municipal council, the number of votes exercisable by each elector
varying according to the annual value of his property. One-third of the members of the
council retire each year. The powers of the council extend to roads, water supply, sewerage,
drainage, lighting, health, and generally to maintaining the good rule and government of
the municipality. The necessary funds are obtained from rates, which are levied on the
basis of the annual value of the land (or, in the case of unimproved land, on 5 per cent, of
the capital value). The rates may not exceed 2s. in the £of such annual value. Provision
is made for the endowment of a municipality from the public funds during the first fifteen
years of its existence.
This system, however, has proved inadequate. Experience has shown that, so long as
local government remained a purely voluntary matter, municipalities were confined to the
JUNCTION DAM BELUBULA RIVER.


more thickly populated parts of the State ; and at the end of 1905, out of a total of 310,700
square miles, less than 3,000 had been brought within the scope of local government; so that,
as a natural consequence, heavy expense was cast on the central government for the maintenance
throughout the State of purely local services.
The desirability of extending the scope of local government had naturally long
afforded matter for political discussion, and in 1905 a Bill, framed to effect this extension, was
introduced by the Carruthers Ministry, and passed into law in December of that year. In
accordance with the provisions of this Act—the “ Local Government (Shires) Act, 1905 ”
the whole State, excluding the more thinly populated Western Division and existing munici-
palities, has been divided into 13+ shires, each of which has been subdivided into three
ridings; and five temporary councillors have been appointed by the Governor to each shire,
for the purpose of making all neces-
sary arrangements for the election of
the first council. This will take place
towards the end of 1906, and there-
after each shire will be governed by
six councillors elected by adult owners
and occupiers (male or female) of
ratable property of the yearly value
of £5 and upwards in the different
ridings, equal representation in the
council being accorded to each riding.
Each council will be presided over
by a president elected annually by
its members. The number of coun-
cillors in any shire may, by resolution
ABORIGINALS—A GROUP IN THE FAR WEST.
of the council, be increased to nine. The first elected council will retire in January, l'.*oB,
and each succeeding council will endure for a term of two years. It is provided that
if any shire fail to elect a council, or if the council when elected refrain from exercising its
functions, the Governor may appoint an administrator (whose salary will be a charge on the
shire’s general fund) to exercise the powers of the council. Rates are to be levied by the
council on the unimproved capital value of the land, and may not be more than 2d. in the £
nor less than Id., although the Governor may, at his discretion, allow' a reduction below this
minimum rate on representation by the council that a smaller rate is sufficient. Land on
which a rate has thus been imposed ceases to be liable for the pavment of land tax ; and
income derived from the rent of the land, and from its use or cultivation, is exempt from
income tax. Provision is made for the endowment of the shires from the State revenue to the
extent of at least £150,000 per annum, this endowment being appropriated to the different
shires according to their needs, for which purpose they will be graded in six different classes.
On a shire being constituted, certain powers and duties attach to its council. These comprise,


amongst others, the control and maintenance of public places, regulation of traffic, lighting,
prevention of bush fires, and construction and maintenance of streets and wharfs. A council
may also acquire other powers, including removal of refuse, provision of water supply, drainage
and sewerage, and licensing of hawkers and public vehicles Provision is made whereby any
park, road, bridge, or public work may be declared by the Governor to be a “ national work,”
in which case its maintenance and administration are controlled by the central government.
A shire, or any part of it, may be constituted a municipality by the Governor.
Legislation has, moreover, been introduced into Parliament for the purpose of assimi-
lating the existing municipalities to the scheme provided in the “ Local Government (Shires)
Act.” One important alteration in the present system is intended in the matter of rates,
which it is proposed should be levied, as in the case of shires, on the ba«is of the unimproved
capital value.

PUBLIC FINANCE.
A system of public finance exists for the Commonwealth as well as for
each of its constituent States.
The Commonwealth revenue is derived mainly from Customs and Excise

duties, and from the Postal Service. The total revenue for the financial year ended 30th
June, 1905, amounted to £11,460,315, of which £8,799,530 represents Customs and Excise
collections, and £2,630,904 gross revenue from the operations of the Post Office. Nearly the
whole of the postal revenue is, of course, absorbed by the cost of maintenance.
The total expenditure of the Commonwealth during the same period amounted to
£4,318,435, the chief items of which were—Maintenance of postal service, £2,560,755; and
Defence, £706,279.
In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, for the present all revenue collected
by the Commonwealth within any State must be credited to that State. The State is then
debited with the expenditure on any of the public departments therein which have been trans-
ferred to the control of the Commonwealth, and also with the State's proportion (on a population
basis) in the other expenditure of the Commonwealth.* The balance is paid to the States
month by month. It is provided in the Constitution that at least three-fourths of the customs
and excise duties collected must be returned to the States.f The total amount repaid to the
WHEAT ARRIVING AT A COUNTRY RAILWAY STATION.
States by the Commonwealth in this way during the year ended 30th June, 1905, was £7,141,668,
of which New South Wales received £2,529,070, the total Commonwealth revenue collected
within this State having amounted to £4,020,727.
• This system of credits and debits is subject to revision after the termination of the “ book-keeping ”
period on Bth October, 1906.
f This provision may be modified by ordinary process of federal legislation after 1910.


The total revenue of New South Wales for the financial year ended 30th
June, 1905, was £11,336,918, and the expenditure £11,195,075, the surplus
of revenue over expenditure being £141,843, for the year.
Of the gross revenue, the chief items were :—£4,527,368 received from the

proceeds of sale and occupation of public lands ; £1,114,408 direct taxation (including land
and income taxes); £534,753 from the water and sewerage service.
The heaviest items of expenditure were —Interest and redemptions of public debt,
£3,176,285 ; maintenance of railways and tramways, £2,911,702 ; education, £839,520; public
works, £689,397 ; charitable aid (including old-age pensions), £965,977 ; law and crime, £769,213 ;
land administration, £307,309 ; water supply and sewerage services, £151,525,
Although direct taxation in the form of land and income taxes is levied, the exemptions
allowed in both cases are such that neither tax can be regarded as burdensome ; while the
former is now in process of being displaced by the rates levied under the local government
extension scheme. The tax payable per annum by owners of land amounts to Id. in the £
of the unimproved value of the land ; but any person, the whole of whose land does not exceed
£240 in value is exempt from the tax, the Id. being charged only on each £ of unimproved
value in excess of £240. A general exemption from land tax will extend to all parts of the
State which are brought within scope of the Local Government Act. The income tax is 6d.
in the £; but here again any person whose income does not exceed £2OO per annum is exempt,
the tax being charged only on that portion of any income which is in excess of £2OO per annum.
Further, no income tax is charged on income derived from land which is subject either to land
tax or to shire rates.


The public debt of New South Wales amounted, on 30th June, 1905, to £82,321,998.
Although the amount is considerable, it must be recollected that practically the whole of it
has been expended for the development of the State’s resources, and £71,121,721, or more than
86 per cent, of the total debt, has been laid out on works that are directly revenue-producing,
As a set-off to the public debt, the State’s assets, derived from the expenditure of loan
moneys, include the whole of the railway system, of which 3,281 miles are now open to traffic,
representing an outlay of £44,274,627; tramways representing £4,130,841 ; water supply and
sewerage works and water conservation works, £11,487,215 ; harbours and rivers works
(including resumptions), £10,661,447. £567,591 has been utilised in making advances to
settlers in need of financial assistance, and the net return received from these advances last
year amounted to £11,907. The clear revenue derived from these directly reproductive
services, after paying all expenses, amounted during the financial year ended 30th June, 1905,
to £2,129,405, the interest payable on the whole public debt for the same period being £2,937,149.
Moreover, a very large proportion of that part of the loan moneys which has been laid out on
services not directly revenue-producing has also been expended for the purpose of developing
the State’s resources. £1,294,887 has been spent on telegraphs and telephones, now managed by
the Commonwealth ; £4,911,698 on public buildings, works, &c. ; £1,713,009 on the construc-
tion of roads and bridges ; £194,430 for the encouragement of immigration : and £1.421,976
on military works (now controlled by the Commonwealth).
The Federal Constitution provides that the Commonwealth may take over such of the
public debt of the States as existed at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or any portion
thereof, according to the respective numbers of their people. When this is done, the interest
payable will be deducted from the surplus revenue now returned to the States by the Common-
wealth, or if the surplus be not sufficient for the purpose, or if there should be no surplus, the
States must pay what is wanting. No part of the State debts has. however, yet been taken
over by the Commonwealth. The borrowing powers of the States are not limited by this
provision, and the Commonwealth has no authority to take over State debts incurred since
the beginning of 1901.

CHAPTER V.
history of Land Settlement.
Legislative Object—The Rural Population - Attraction of the Cities- Some big
Estates—Our National Development.
N 1861 was passed a Land Act, always known by the name
of its author—Sir John Robertson—which enabled
settlers to take possession of areas selected before survey,
and to start work immediately after selection.
The experience of the past forty-four years has
failed to realise many of the great advantages predicted
in the exciting days of the “ selection-before-survey ”
struggle of 1860-61. Some districts have been retarded
by the indiscriminate methods sanctioned by that Act.
The wrong men got land in good places ; the right men got it in bad places ; settlement was
too much scattered ; and the difficulties of pioneering life unnecessarily aggravated. On the
other hand, many were encouraged to select land for agriculture, entered upon its possession
as bond fide settlers, and have generally improved their position in every material direction
until they have in many cases become independent freeholders, enjoying most of the comforts
and simple luxuries of older countries, forming the sinews of this young land, and supplying
its greatest source of strength in peace and war.
Although undoubtedly the object of all land legislation in this State has
been to settle an industrious population on the soil, and to attain this end
many changes have been made from time to time, the results must have
been disappointing to the men who used to look forward to the creation of
a great Australian yeomanry. In 1861 the rural population consisted of
The
Legislative
Object.
189,116 persons out of a total of 348,950, equal to 542 per cent. ; forty years afterwards the
rural population numbered 422,447 out of a total of 1,346,720, or 31 4 per cent. This would
seem to imply the very antithesis of successful land settlement. During the same period the
area of land absolutely parted with by the Crown rose from 7,146,579 acres to 49,623,081, which
means that in 1861 the amount of alienated land was 37'8 acres for each head of the rural
population, while in 1901 it amounted to 117 o acres, so that instead of increasing the number
of persons on the soil, we have merely trebled the average amount of land held by each of them.


The Act of 1884 was passed to limit the amount of land saleable by auction in any year
to 200,000 acres, and other suitable restrictions were placed upon land sales, but yet we find
that though the area disposed of in 1881, when compared with the total population, was
greater than at the present time, compared with the rural population the area was
appreciably less.
About 1876 the urban population became equal to that living in the
country districts, and from thence onwards grew far more rapidly than
the rural, so that at the last census it was found that the urban population
exceeded the rural by about 120 per cent. The population of Sydney and

suburbs had risen from 27 4 per cent, in 1861 and 1871, to 30 - l per cent, in 1881, 34 - 3 per cent,
in the next decade, and 35 8 per cent, during the next ten years, standing at 35-5 per cent,
at the present time. The urban population (including Newcastle, and 221 other towns having
a population of over 500) stood at 184 per cent, in 1861, and steadily rose to 19*4 per cent..

27 per cent., 31 per cent., 32'8 per cent., during the next four decades respectively, standing
at 33 per cent, to-day. The rural population outside of these cities and towns stood at 54-2
per cent, in 1861, then gradually decreased to 53 2 per cent., 42 9 per cent., 34 7 per cent., 31-4
per cent., during the next four decades respectively, standing at 31 5 per cent, to-day.
In explanation of these figures, however, it must be borne in mind that forty years
ago a large number of women and girls—the farmers’ wives and daughters—were actively
engaged in dairy work, but owing to the operations of the separator, the factories, and the
creameries, the same class of women are not now included among rural workers. But an
undoubted cause of the decrease in rural workers is the aggregation of large estates, frequently
by the absorption of a number of the smaller holdings of selectors, whereby an economy of
labour —most undesirable from the national point of view—has been effected.


The best energies of our statesmen are now being directed to the rectifying of this evil,
and to the subdivision of these huge estates, and the settlement of large numbers of families
by a more intense system of cultivation.
No characteristic of modern industrial life has been productive of more speculation
as to its probable effect on the progress of humanity than this concentration of population
into large cities. In the older countries of the world there ha; been a steady influx of popu-
lation from the rural districts, and statesmen and economists have been much concerned lest
the movement should end in the decay and possible extinction of the healthful rural class to
which our virile race has owed so much in the past. We can understand this state of affairs
in Great Britain, where the manufacturing industries have changed the character of the occu-
pations of the people, and have consequently attracted to the towns from the country the
young people, drawn by the hope of more remunerative employment and the allurements of
social life.
In the United States the same condition of things is found to a greater or
less extent, but there the rise of the enormous manufacturing cities has
also been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the rural population.
The figures supplied by the Statistician’s Department show that in England
only 4 - 6 per cent, of the total population are engaged in rural industries,
The
Attraction of
the Cities.
in Scotland 6 9 per cent., in Ireland 19 6 per cent., in France 44 - 7 per cent., in Germany 32 per
cent., in Italy 29’6 per cent., in Denmark 38 - 7 per cent., in Holland 45 per cent., in Sweden
46-2 per cent., in Switzerland 37 9 per cent., and in New South Wales 8 7 per cent. While
one can understand why such cities as London, Paris, and New York must attract large numbers
of people on account of their immense commercial importance and attractiveness as centres
of art, literature, and national life, it is hard to see why Svdney should have been such a
powerful magnet in drawing and retaining such a large percentage of the immigrants from
Great Britain and other countries, besides many from our own rural districts. Of every
thousand persons added to the popula-
tion during the last census period 267
were drawn from other towns and rural
districts of this State, and 733 came
from abroad, or were attributable to
natural increase.
Probably the geographical position
of Sydney is accountable for much of
it, for it is found that immigrants to
Australia linger long in their port of debarkation, and they seldom care to leave it while
employment is procurable. It must be admitted that rural life in Australia in the early days
offered few social attractions to the successful settler, who often turned, as soon as he had
amassed a competence, to the metropolis for the comforts which the country was unable to


furnish. Every year is equalising things better, rural life becoming more attractive, and
the stress and strain of strenuous city life more nerve-racking and more distasteful to many.
But above all the
other attractions, the
abnormal loan ex-
penditure of the
financial years
between June, 1901,
and June, 1903,
totalling £9,417,972,
had the effect of
providing employ-
meut in a succession of large enterprises carried out at the expense of the State, and paid for
out of these external loans, w’hich not only provided employment for our own people, but
attracted to New South Wales a large number of persons, w r ho, having no instinct towards
farming, quitted the rural districts on the completion of the public works which gave them
employment, and flocked into the towns, generally into the metropolis, there to swell the large
class of unskilled labour.
Wool-grow’iug, which has been for many years our staple industry, has
not been conducive to the employment of large numbers of rural labourers,
for the actual tending of the flocks needs few hands, and these widely
scattered ; while the handling of the bales of wool at the ports of shipment—

large number of unskilled city labourers. In point of fact, during the past ten years, the
number of persons actually employed in pastoral pursuits has decreased by 7,000, and now-
shows the small total of 27,886 persons, or 19 per cent, of the total population, as against
100,244 actually engaged in agriculture and dairying, being 6’B per cent, of the whole popula-
tion. In connection with these figures it must be noted that the pastoral industry is by far the
most important item in our national wealth, yielding last year £16,500,000, while agriculture
and dairying produced £10,000,000 and mining £7,000,000. The progress of rural settlement
with us show’s very uneven distribution, closely settled patches alternating with wide tracts
very thinly peopled. This has been due to a variety of causes, such as the natural advantages
of certain districts, propinquity to markets, and above all, probably, the effects of our land
legislation, and its methods of administration. The one factor which has done more than
any other during the past twenty years to encourage land settlement, and increase the area
of agriculture as distinguished from grazing, has been the extension of our railway system
throughout the length and breadth of the State. With the commencement of their construc-
tion the era of sound progress set in, and with a still further extension of our railway system
in right directions there will be a greater stimulus to the unlocking of large estates and settle-
ment for agricultural purposes than can be attained by any artificial legislation.


To show how our national estate has been alienated, and has aggregated
into a number of large areas in comparatively few hands, the following
figures may be quoted :—Holdings of 1 to 30 acres number altogether
24,640, and they absorb 190,921 acres ; holdings from 31 to 400 acres

amount to 35,787, and the total of these is 5,347,019 acres ; holdings of 401 to 1,000 acres
number 91,011, and their aggregate area is 5,718,931 acres ; holdings of 1,001 to 10,000 acres
number 5,512, which aggregate 13,994,182 acres ; holdings of 10,001 acres and upwards number
722, and their aggregate acreage is 22,830,261, of which 41 are in the Western Division, embracing
1,066,956 acres, under conditions where large holdings are absolutely necessary under present
circumstances. These figures indicate a development of affairs that will not much longer
serve the general interests of our State, 722 persons or financial institutions holding nearly
one-half, 6,234 holding more than three-quarters of all the land already alienated by the Crown.
IN A WESTERN WHEAT-FIELD.
The vast area of many of these holdings, occupied mainly as they are for purely grazing
purposes, undoubtedly tends to check rural development. Included within what has been
termed the wheat belt, which is stated by competent authorities to be suited for the cultivation
of wheat owing to its quality of soil, rainfall, and other climatic conditions, there is an area


THRESHING ON A WHEAT-FARM IN RIVERINA.
which may be moderately computed at 20,000,000 acres (some authorities say 25,000,000),
which ought to be growing wheat for the support of the human race. When we reflect that of
the 49,623,081 acres alienated the total area under crop at present amounts to only 2,672,973
acres (less than 5 5 per cent.), we can realise what a vast population this area of 20,000,000
acres of wheat land used for pastoral purposes could be made to support, if it were devoted
to its proper use —say, a million souls on the farms, who would in their turn give work and
sustenance to three times as many in cities, towns, and villages. Of the total area held in blocks
of 1 to 30 acres, over 26 per cent, is cultivated, of the holdings of 31 to 400 acres, 14 49 per
cent, is under cultivation, and of the area held in blocks of 1,001 to 10,000 acres, 5 - 13 per
cent, is cropped ; while of the enormous area held by the 722 persons, syndicates, and financial
institutions who have nearly 23,000,000 acres, only 300,159 acres, or 1-3 per cent., are under
crop, which makes one pray that the ominous words of Goldsmith may never be applicable
to this highly favoured young country :
“ 111 fares the land to hastening ills a prey
Where wealth accumulates while men decay.”
No wonder that our population is sparse, being less than five persons per
square mile, while Belgium has fi!3, England 577, Holland 431, Italy, 297,

grazing less than 4s. per acre on all land alienated from the Crown, and less than Is. per

Among the factors that are tending to brighten the prospects of the State with regard
to closer settlement we may rank high the new system of farming on “ shares,” now practised
with conspicuous success by a number of large landholders in the Corowa, Wagga, Young,
Grenfell, Parkes, Tamworth, and Narromine Districts. The idea will appeal, strongly, we think,
to the class of men whom we want to induce to come to us from the old country—men of good
practical experience in agriculture, with a little capital and abundance of grit and perseverance.
Mr. J. Q. Wood of Hrundah testifies that his tenants on this system and he himself are equally
satisfied. He intimates that the net returns to the landowner, under this system, are twice to
three times as great; that an estate which would return £2,000 per annum from wool alone,
would, if suitable for wheat-farming, return on an average £lO,OOO from wheat, and that at
least twenty families would be thereby settled on the soil. Messrs. Mack and Austin of Narro-
mine give the results of two men working a farm of 303 acres on this system :
As at present practised it is in many cases a kind of nomadic farming. The man and his
family come at the right time with the horses and implements ; they camp on the ground and
get in the crop ; depart to their permanent home or other work till the crop is ready, when they
return and harvest it, bag it, stack it, and, perhaps, earn extra money by carting it to the nearest
railway. But from this beginning will gradually evolve a system under which the owner will
cut up his estate into farms, fence them, and erect the necessary buildings, as desirable tenants
come along, and then pursue a system of mixed farming, with a greater variety of crops and
the use of approved means of conserving the fertility of the soil. This system will admirably
suit immigrants who have little capital besides their skill and industry, and who will be able,
while getting their colonial experience, to profit by the experience of old settlers.
Unfortunately the tendency of the total value of produce per acre has
rather been downwards during the past twenty years owing to depreciation
of wheat, for it was £G 2s. 4d. in 1880, £5 Os. lid. in 1883, £3 19s. 3d. in
1893, only £1 IGs. lOd. in 1903 after the terrible drought of 1902, and £3 ss. 9d.

in 1904. What a picture these figures convey !
But the grand total shows an encouraging
increase, since the total area under cultivation
has steadily grown from 710,337 acres in 1881
to 2,672,973 acres at the present time, and the
average area of cultivation per inhabitant has
increased from -9 acres to 2-2. The output of
wool has increased in value from £5,765,761 in
1878 to £9,274,387 for the last year for which
statistics are available, though it must be noted


that there have been great fluctuations in price in the meanwhile, since we had £10,643,089
in 1889, over £11,000,000 in 1891, and over £10,000,000 again in 1892 and 1899.
The totals from wool, and from all classes of agricultural produce for last year were
almost equal, although the area under crops was only one-fourteenth of that held by graziers
under conditional purchase, and one-fifty-ninth of the total held under purchase and by lease.
Another encouraging sign is the increase in the value of our dairying output, the export of
butter for 1904 having amounted to 20,513,307 lb., and for 1905 about the same, almost three
times as much as the output for the year 1903. There has been a satisfactory increase in all
classes of stock during the past year, but the totals are still far behind the records of 1895
and 1896, except in the one case of pigs.
When we compare the value of the total agricultural produce of our State per head of
population with that of other countries, we find that, agriculturally speaking, we are not by
any means at the bottom of the list. Little Denmark stands highest with £8 6s. per head,
United States, £7 75., France £7 35., Canada £6 95., Argentine Republic £6, while we come next
with £5 95., Austria following with £5 75., Spain £5 55., Germany £5 Is., Belgium and Italy
£4 65., Holland £4, Switzerland, £3, and the United Kingdom £3 2s.
And we notice that in the acreage under cultivation per head of population
we occupy a somewhat similar relative position. The United States comes
highest with 10 9 acres, Canada 5-6, Argentine Republic 4 4, Denmark 2-9,

1-5 per cent, to crops, while 64-3 per cent, is devoted to grazing. In the average area of
holdings the United States stands highest with 146-2 acres, and New South Wales comes
second with 70-9 acres, England 65-3, Scotland 61’5, Spain 61, Denmark 41-5, Germany 19-2,
Belgium 5-2, where no fewer than 88 per cent, of the holdings do not exceed 5 acres ;
Denmark coming next with 47 per cent., Germany, 45 per cent.


The history of our first century of existence is a record of steady, not brilliant,
progress, of many vicissitudes and trials, of progress alternating with stagnation, of hope
succeeded by blank despair, failure of some and brilliant success of others—all largely affected
bv our cycles of recurring droughts and floods, by visitations of blights and vermin, but
above all aggravated by mistakes in Government, weak or ignorant administration, absence of
technical knowledge, want of thrift, an inadequate and stereotyped system of education, alike
for city and country, failure to give assistance at the critical moment, and a want of
uniformity in land legislation having especial regard to agricultural settlement.

A century ago, the infant colony was practically bounded on the north by

in 1815, opened up new country of great promise, discovered pasturage for millions of sheep,
and presented vistas of still greater territory to be explored. In 1850, many felt that the
limits of habitable country had been reached, and that nothing but arid desert lay all around.


The discovery of gold in 1851 sent adventurous spirits further afield and revealed new
potentialities of agricultural and pastoral wealth, which have been of more enduring value
than the richest of our goldfields. Thirty years ago dairy farmers were despondent, fearing
that their industry had reached its zenith and that the available markets were overstocked.
Rutter coming from the South Coast, by little steamers, in summer time often realised not
more than 4|d. per pound, and it was really worth no more, being merely an inferior grade
of cart grease. The separator and the factory, with the refrigerating chamber on the steamer,
have changed all that, and to-day we can compete on equal terms with Denmark, France,
and Russia, in the almost illimitable market of Great Britain,
To the man who may feel any doubt as to the possibility of getting land
suitable for agricultural purposes on reasonable terms, we would point out
that public opinion and the trend of legislation both point to the sub-
division of large estates in the near future, and whether these estates

competition.

barley ; all his beverages, from champagne down to coffee and tea ; nearly all the fruits that
can be grown, from mangoes and bananas to strawberries ; and all the luxuries that appeal
to old and young, from ostrich feathers down to castor oil. How can there be any anxiety
about the overproduction of fruit, when we know that this State alone imports at the present
time more canned fruit and preserves than could be grown on an additional 5,000 acres of
orchards, while other States are at present still less able to supply their own necessities.
We have many successful bee-farmers, and yet we import honey and wax every year.
We have .330,000 pigs, and are still importing bacon and hams. Not only can we extend the
area of our dairying operations, but we can greatly increase the intensiveness. We now
have 425,000 dairy cows, whose average yield is 373 gallons per annum, which can be certainly
increased to nearly 600 gallons with more knowledge, more skill, and greater care.
In short, there is plenty of room on the soil for more farmers of the right type, and
plenty of room at the top of that valued class of producers for superior men, who understand
the problems of their calling and who can increase the productiveness alike of their soil and of
their stock.
The actual evolutionary stages of our national development have now
reached a point at which we can safely extend the area of our agriculture
and mixed farming, without in the slightest degree imperilling or diminishing
the value of our great pastoral industry. The generous provision of railways,
much in advance of present requirements, to districts once deemed unsuitable

even for pastoral pursuits, has done much to pave the way for intenser cultivation. The


discovery and tapping of the great basin of artesian water have given stability to the pastoral
industry in districts in the dry west, where periodical droughts have hitherto made it a risky
investment, and they will in due course supply considerable areas of cultivation, which will
give further confidence to the grazier, and at the same time increase the comforts of living
for the western settlers.
The possibilities of irrigation have been proved to the minds of the governing powers,
and within a short time vast areas will be devoted to orchards, vineyards, and mixed farming,
which now merely support one sheep to the acre.
Much educational work has been done by the experimental labours of
pioneers in different directions, by the progressive agricultural papers which
are available at small charge to the farming class, and by the useful educa-
tional work done by the Department of Agriculture, through its district
experiment farms and the investigations of its scientific staff. The intro-

duction of new crops and grasses, the improvement of varieties of seed (more especially wheat),
the introduction of new blood in all classes of stock, mainly by private enterprise, and the
publication by the Government and by the daily press of the results of experiments in different
parts, and the good educational work being done by many agencies, all have paved the way
for a more effective occupation of the vast areas of agricultural land, which have hitherto been
used only for grazing.
Above all, there has been a practical tone given to our national system of education
by the establishment of an Agricultural College, and agricultural schools in different climatic
districts of the State, and a technical flavour
given to the general system pursued in the
primary sc’ ools of the State, which must have
a far-reaching effect in moulding the destinies
of the rising generation.
We are now going through the different
stages in our evolution which the United States
passed through a century ago, and there can
be no doubt that our progress during the next
half century will be as great, as remarkable,
and as enduring as that which historians of that

great territory have now placed on record. We have the soil, the agricultural potentialities,
the mineral wealth, the favourable climatic conditions, and everything that is needed to build
up a great and powerful nation, and we re now in a position to invite men and women from
all parts of the British Empire. Europe, and the United States to come and help us in our
nation-building.

Too liberal treatment in the forties, fifties, and sixties, and quite as late as the eighties,

prove can be much more profitably utilised by “ closer settlement ” ; and the cattle-runs and

directed to making the way of the newcomer and settler as easy as possible. With this end
in view, various Acts have been passed, and more are now in contemplation, whereby
settlers may secure the balance of the Crown lands available on exceptionally easy terms,
and in what are known and aptly described as “ living areas.”

tion, for the payment of full compensation, estimated by a legally constituted tribunal,
thereby safeguarding the owners against hardship.
It should, however, be borne in mind by intending settlers that, though now the path
to success is not so rugged as that which fell to the lot of the pioneer, at the same time, unless
one has sufficient capital to purchase an improved farm, with cleared land ready for the
plough, the “ taking up ” or selection of Crown lands presupposes a deal of solid hard work
before the returns begin to come in. AS bile it must be admitted that, as in Canada, United
States of America, and the majority of the other Australian States, the greater proportion
of the better-class New South Wales Crown lands have been alienated, still there remains
open for settlement in various forms a considerable area which may be secured upon conditions
tersely described at the end of this chapter.

to be
opened up.
When the Northern Rivers land was first taken up, the roads, save main
roads, were for the most part tracks, and no railway communication existed
to the port. Much pioneering work of a hard nature had to be done before
the fruits of the labour were ripe. To-day the Crown is opening up for
settlement, between Lismore and Murwillumbah, on the Iweed Ri\er, a
large tract of good land, but admittedly back from settlement. The newcomer must be prepared
to do, as did his now prosperous comrade nearer the townships wait for the comforts that
follow settlement. Fencing, clearing, grubbing must precede the purchase of the buggy and
piano. As of the Tweed River lands, so of the Dorrigo scrub, some 100 miles southward.
Some of the best farming land in the world is to be shortly placed upon the market, and though
removed some little distance from the seaport, presents similar features to that of the older
settlements of a few years ago.

the seaboard as the crow flies, several estates
have been recently placed on the market, both
by private individuals and the Crown, and the
newcomer to the district is recommended to
inspect the results achieved already by pur-
chasers at Bannockburn, Myall Creek, Furraca-
bad, and Byron Estates, all of which were
either cattle or sheep runs up to within a year
or two ago. In the districts on the southern
tableland, also, private estates are being sub-
divided and placed on the market as the
demand warrants.
Crown Lands
System.
For the purpose of departmental reference, the Crown lands are divided
into three territorial divisions, controlled by the same ministerial head,
but subject to a distinct system of administration, in regard to their tenure,
areas that can be acquired, and conditions of occupancy or purchase. These
divisions, from their geographical position, are aptly described and known as the Eastern, Central,
and Western Divisions. The three areas aggregate 198,(XX),(XX) acres, of which about
62,000,000 comprise the Eastern, 56,(XX),000 the Central, and 80,000,000 the Western Division.
Roughly speaking, the Eastern comprises the land situated between the Dividing or
Coastal Range and the coast, including the tablelands to the westward, extending roughly
about 180 miles from the sea. With the exception of lands before referred to as being prepared
for settlement on the North Coast, the bulk of the country adapted for profitable working
has been alienated, though from time to time timber reserves and commonages in other parts
are being placed upon the market.
The Central Division extends generally west from the foothills of the Western tablelands
and slopes, from Queensland on the north to the Victorian border, a tract of country about
750 miles long by 200 miles wide. A great portion of the wool and wheat industry is here
carried on. The Division is intersected by three trunk lines of railway and many feeders,
watered by several rivers, and possesses many varieties of climate. Nearly half the area of
the division is within the artesian water bearing district.
The W estern Division, comprising the balance of the State, is almost exclusively devoted
to sheep and cattle-raising, and though little of the land comparatively is absolutely alienated
from the Crown, the rainfall and other conditions preclude settlement except in large holdings,
necessitating a considerable outlay of capital. In country having a carrying capacity of, say,
10 acres to the sheep it may be postulated that large flocks must be carried to render the
holdings profitable, and large flocks mean large runs. The seasons too, are very variable,
and though fortunes are quickly made in good times, the Western squatter does well to have
a substantial sinking fund against the converse of a “ rainy day.’


CROWN LANDS.
Information concerning the Crown Lands is officially supplied by the Lands Depart-
ment as follows:—It is estimated that New South Wales contains 198,634,880 acres, and
although a large proportion of this land has been alienated from the C rown, a \ er\ considerable
area is still available for settlement.
The management and control of the
alienation to private persons of the
land which is still Crown property is
the special function of a great State
Department the Department of
Lands. The lands open for settlement
under the Crown Lands Acts, and to
which the attention of intending settlers
is specially invited, are situated in the
Eastern and Central Divisions. In
consequence of climatic and other dis-
advantages the lands in the Western
Division are dealt with under a special Act of Parliament, which is administered by a Board,
known as the “ Western Land Board.” Little need be said about the Western Division except
that a considerable area, estimated at about 4,250,000 acres, is available ; and leaseholds of
much larger areas can be acquired there than are obtainable in the other Divisions, and on
exceedingly liberal terms.
The Eastern Division offers great facilities for dairy and agricultural
farming. The climate, during most of the year, is temperate, the rainfall in
average seasons is abundant, and, except in certain localities, extremes of
either heat or cold are not experienced. This Division is intersected by
Eastern

numerous rivers and water-courses, and still contains magnificent forests of hardwood, and
other marketable timber of high commercial value, while an extensive railway system and a
large and increasing fleet of coasting steamers and sailing vessels afford ample facilities for
the transport of stock and produce to markets in Sydney and elsewhere. The North Coast
district contains ideal country for dairy and agricultural farming—the rainfall being usually
almost tropical in its regularity—while the soil is for the most part deep, fertile, and admirably
suitable for growing maize, oats, barley, sugar-cane, lucerne, and fruits, also root crops and
vegetables of every description. In this district a comparatively small area will support a
family, and, although climatic and other conditions in the immediate vicinity of the coast are
not favourable for wheat-growing, much of that part of the Eastern Division which lies west
of the “ Dividing Range ” is eminently suitable for the growth of that cereal—quite as much so,
in fact, as the Central Division, which is usually regarded as the wheat-growing area proper.


The eastern parts of this Division are especially adapted for wheat-growing;
in the middle lands, agriculture is hardly as safe, although largely followed,
while the whole district is admirably suited and extensively used for pastoral
purposes. Some of the finest samples of wheat and the best classes of wool

are produced in this Division. The summer temperature for about three months is high, but
otherwise the climate is delightful, and at all times extremely healthy. The diseases to which
stock are subject in the moister climates are unknown here. There are several easy methods
of acquiring Crown lands, either as freeholds or under leasehold tenures. For a settler seeking
to make a home on the land, the holdings known as homestead selections, settlement leases,
conditional purchases, and conditional purchase leases are in every way suitable and
convenient.

This is a very convenient tenure for a settler of limited means. Only

the age of 16 years. The homestead selector must reside continuously on the land for five
years, on the expiration of which a grant will be issued to him. After the issue of the grant he

must continue to reside on the holding for at least seven months in each year. The annual
rent for the first six years will be an amount equal to 1|- per cent, of the capital value of
the land ( i.e ., 3d. in the pound), after which the rent will be increased to 2£ per cent, of the
capital value. Areas up to 1,280 acres may be held under this tenure, and the Act provides
for the appraisement of the capital value and readjustment of the annual rent every ten
years. Should an area granted under this tenure be found to be insufficient for the mainten-
ance of a home, it may, under certain circumstances, be increased. This provision also
applies to settlement leases and conditional purchases.
Areas up to 1,280 acres for agricultural purposes, and 10,240 acres for
grazing, may be obtained as settlement leases. Such leases have a term
of forty years, and provision is made for the reappraisement of the rent
every ten years, since the introduction of the 1903 Act. A settlement lease

cannot be granted to a minor. The area leased must be fenced within five years, and the lessee
must reside continuously on his holding during the whole term of the lease. After five years
residence the lessee may apply for a homestead grant of that part of the holding on which
his dwelling-house is situated, but the area so applied for must not exceed 1,280 acres.


The intending conditional purchaser must, on application, pay the pre-
scribed deposit, and a survey fee according to the fixed scale. The deposit
is 10 per cent, of the price of the land as notified. An applicant must not be
less than 16 years of age. At the end of the third year from date of appli.
cation an instalment of ninepence per acre must be paid if the land is

unclassified, and at the rate of ninepence for each pound of the purchase money if it is
within a classified area. A similar instalment is due annually until the purchase money, with
interest at 2£ per cent, on the outstanding balance due to the Crown, is paid off. The condi-
tional purchaser will also be subject to conditions of fencing his holding within three years,
and residing thereon for a period of ten years. He has the privilege of applying for a
conditional lease of three times the area of his conditional purchase, and, having acquired such
lease, he may at his convenience, and on payment of the necessary deposit, convert the
whole or any part of it into a conditional purchase. Further details in connection with this
class of holding can be readily gathered from the Crown Lands Acts and Regulations, and
from the Departmental pamphlets on the subject.
This is a new tenure created by the Crown Lands Amendment Act of
1905. It enables the intending settler, for a small initial outlay by way
of deposit, for a moderate rent, and under easy conditions, to obtain a lease
for forty years of land convertible at any time during that period into a
conditional purchase. An applicant, if a male, must not be under the age

of 18 vears, or 21 years if a female. No one may apply who already holds any land, other
than town or suburban, or land leased from a private individual; and a deposit of half a year’s
rent, and at least one-fifth of the survey fee, must be lodged with the application. The survey
fee is fixed in accordance with the scale prescribed for original conditional purchases, and,
if the full survey fee be not paid with the application, the balance must be paid subsequently
by annual instalments of not less than a fifth of the full amount.
The annual rent for the first ten years is fixed at 2£ per cent, of the capital value of the
land, and, should applicant be dissatisfied with the amount, provision is made for reappraise-
ment of the capital value at intervals of ten years during the term of the lease.
The conditional purchase lessee must within
twelve months after confirmation of his application
commence to reside on his holding, and must reside
thereon continuously for ten years ; but, under cer-
tain conditions, commencement of residence may be
deferred to any date within five years from such
confirmation, and, with the permission of the
Local Land Board, residence may be performed in
any village or town in the immediate vicinity of
the holding.


Much attention is being given at present by both Parliament and the
Lands Department to the subject of land settlement, and as it is recognised
that, in order to meet the growing demand for land, it will be necessary to
make resumptions of lands which have already been alienated, an Act,
called the “ Closer Settlement Act,” was recently passed, which gives the

Government ample power to resume private lands, and to alienate them on favourable terms
to persons who desire to settle and make homes for themselves and their families on the soil.
Only one estate, which is situated in the Inverell district, has so far been acquired and
made available for settlement under this Act. The Government is, however, so fully satisfied
that a wider application of the provisions of the Act will be for the ultimate advantage,
both of the settler and of the State, that other areas will shortly be brought under their
operation. An applicant for land under this Act must be at least 18 years of age if a male,
and 21 years if a female. The preliminary deposit is 5 per cent, of the notified value of the

settlement purchase, and an instalment of a similar amount must be paid annually until the
purchase money, with interest at 4 per cent., is paid off. Under this scheme of payment the
holding will become freehold in thirty-eight years.
A condition of ten years’ residence attaches to every settlement purchase, and residence
must be commenced within twelve months from the date of the Land Board’s decision allowing
the purchase. As in the case of a conditional purchase lease, the date of commencement of
residence may be postponed by permission of the Land Board for any period not exceeding
five years from the allowance of the purchase, and the residence condition may be fulfilled
in any adjacent village or town.
For convenience of administration, the State is subdivided into many Land
Board Districts, in which are appointed various Crown Land Agents from
whom forms of application are obtainable, and with whom they must be
lodged on certain specified days. These applications are dealt with by local

governing bodies, designated Land Boards, who inquire into and report upon the bond fides
of each applicant. The question of capital values is also referred to them for report, which
is subsequently submitted for confirmation to the ministerial head of the Lands Depart-
ment. Owing to the various amendments of the Crown Lands Act, the bare copies of Acts
of Parliament would, perhaps, confuse the stranger; but the Department issues pamphlets
and plans which explainin simple language the necessary formulae for taking up available
country.
The local Crown Land Agents will be found ready to supply any information sought
on the spot, while the Central Inquiry and Information Bureau at the Head Office in
Sydney lays itself out to supply
all possible details as to climatic
conditions, nature of soil, class of

CHAPTER VII
Advances to Settlers.
HE granting of loans under the Advances to Settlers Acts
is probably the most important of the concessions
Ini offered by the State to settlers. These Acts provide
® w y for the making of loans repayable by instalments
(including principal and interest) extending over a
long period of years, the rate of interest charged
being the lowest at which the State can lend money
without loss.
The original Advances to Settlers Act came into

(chairman, advances to settlers board).
force on the 4th April, 1899. It provided for raising a sum of £500,000 by the sale of
inscribed stock, with a view of making temporary advances to settlers who were financially
embarrassed owing to drought. The loans were repayable by instalments, including principal
and interest, at 4 per centum per annum, the longest term being ten years and the
maximum amount that could be advanced to a settler being £2OO.
By amendments to the principal Act, a wider scope was given to its operations. The
amount available for realisation by sale of stock was increased to £1,000,000, and the terms
of individual loans were altered to enable advances up to £5OO (subsequently amended to £1,500)
to be made for any period not exceeding thirty-one years, at a rate of interest which was to
be “ not less than 4 per centum per annum.” The actual rate of interest, however, was
fixed by Regulation at 5 per centum per annum with a rebate of i per cent, if the instal-
ments were paid within fourteen days of their due date.
The Advances to Settlers Board consists of three members—Messrs. W. H. O’Malley
Wood, C. Brandis, and R. W. Hardie, —
Mr. Wood being the chairman and super-
visor of the staff. Mr. George W. Cocks
is the Secretary of the Board. Meetings
are held whenever necessary for the
conduct of business.


Advances are made upon the security of freehold lands, conditional pur-
chases, with or without associated conditional leases, settlement leases,
homestead selections and grants, and homestead leases. Forms for appli-
cation may be obtained at the Office of the Board (Public Works Buildings,
Sydney), or from Local Crown Lands Agents. The form should be

carefully filled in by the applicant and the Declaration annexed thereto made before a
Justice of the Peace. The application should then be forwarded to the Secretary,
accompanied by the prescribed deposit to cover the cost of obtaining a report on the
security and of dealing with the case.
Intending applicants are advised to lodge their applications well in advance of the
date upon which they desire the loan. At the present time the Board have no inspectors on
their staff—the necessary valuations being obtained (by the favour of the Department of
Lands) through District Surveyors, Inspectors of Conditional Purchases, and other qualified
officers of that Department. In consequence of the multifarious duties of such officials, coupled
with the extensive travelling to be done, it is only possible to carry out,this Board’s inspections
when they fall in with the officer’s regular field duties. It may be explained that if special

inspectors were sent to value securities the cost would exceed the moderate fees prescribed
by the Regulations. If, however, an applicant desires an immediate inspection, and is prepared
to pay the extra cost, the Board endeavour to arrange for a special report. Should the actual
cost of inspection exceed the estimated cost, the applicant is required to pay the difference.
The basis upon which advances are made is not fixed by legislation—
the Act merely stipulates that “ security for the repayment of the advance
shall be given to the satisfaction of the Board.” In order, however, to
avoid disappointment to applicants, and at the same time furnish them with

some idea of the amount likely to be advanced upon any security, the following information
is supplied :
On freeholds, advances are made up to two-thirds of the unimproved value of the land,
plus half the official value of the improvements, the value of the improvements being the
increased sale value they give the security in the open market.

On conditionally purchased land, an advance would not exceed two-thirds of the holder’s
paid-up interest in the freehold, plus one-half the official value of the improvements.
On conditionally purchased and conditionally leased lands, an advance
Leased Land, would not exceed two-thirds of the paid-up interest in the freehold of the
conditional purchase, plus one-half of the official value of the improvements
on the whole security.
On settlement leases, homestead selections, homestead grants, and homestead leases, an
advance would not exceed one half the official value of the improvements.
Where the amount proposed to be advanced upon the security of freehold or conditionally
purchased land, homestead selections, or homestead grants, exceeds £SO, the maximum term of

thirtv-onc years is allowed for repayment if the applicant so desires. Where the amount is
less than £SO the Board usually fixes shorter terms for repayment.
When the security consists wholly or in part of a lease, the period for repayment is
influenced by the date of expiration of the lease.
In a case where a loan has been granted for a term less than the maximum
period, a borrower is entitled to apply to have the period for repayment
extended so as to reduce the periodical instalments. The Board usually
insist upon payment of accrued interest on the loan and lands claims before
granting the extension sought.

care in making advances upon orchard properties and vineyards, and accordingly they usually
require a larger margin of security than in other cases.
Poultry and pig farms (unless forming part of a dairy or agricultural security) are also
properties upon which it is found that only small advances can safely be made; indeed, it is
questionable whether these properties should not be altogether left alone.

but now that better seasons prevail borrowers are expected to meet their obligations with
punctuality, and, in cases where they fail to do so, prompt steps are being taken to call
up the loan.

It is also covenanted that borrowers shall punctually pay all claims for rent, &c., due to
the Department of Lands, and comply with the conditions imposed by the Crown Lands Acts.
Although advances are granted for a fixed term, and the arrangement, so
far as the Crown is concerned, is unalterable, yet the Board, as a matter of
grace, allow borrowers (if they so desire) to repay the loan at any time during
its currency; but interest must always be paid up to the date upon which
the current instalment falls due. The Board usually consents to a transfer

of a security provided instalments are paid to date, and the transferee accepts personal liability
for the unpaid balance of the loan. In cases where a borrower desires to effect a second
mortgage with a private individual, the Board will always produce the title deeds in their
possession for registration purposes. Hitherto this has been done without making any
charge, but it will be necessary in the near future to frame a schedule of charges for services
of this character, as a considerable amount of labour is imposed upon the Board which
should, in all fairness, be paid for by the parties concerned.
The amount already raised by sale of stock is £414,450, and this sum has been almost
wholly absorbed in making loans to settlers. The amount remaining to be raised under the
existing Act is £585,550.
During a recent session of the State Parliament a Bill “ to amalgamate
the Savings Banks and create a special Department for making advances
to settlers ” was passed by the Legislative Assembly, but rejected by the
Legislative Council. It is understood, however, that a similar measure

list could be materially added to, as will be gathered from a perusal of the chapters of this
book, by a more comprehensive adaptation of the scientific principles of agriculture, and by
the more rapid development of some of our latent resources.
The export of wool to the British market is at present the most important
item in our export list. France and Germany are among the largest customers
of the State, while Belgium is also a considerable purchaser. Great Britain
is also at present, and will probably continue to be, the largest purchaser

of frozen meats of all descriptions from New South Wales. It will be seen from the attached
statement of trade with oversea countries
during 1905 that, apart from the trade done
with European nations direct, there is also
an increase in our commerce with the
countries comprising North and South
America, the most important being Canada,
the United States, and Chili. A small
amount of business is done with Aden in
the Red Sea, and there are yet possibilities
of considerable business at Port Said,
Cairo, and Alexandria.


Cape Colony, Ceylon, Burmah, Gibraltar, and many other outposts of the British
Empire, all do more or less trade with this State, and allowing that in this countr\ almost
every requisite of the human race can be produced, there is no limit to the possible extent
of our trade in all parts of the world in the years to come.
In 1905 New Zealand imported from New South Wales £934,601 worth
of goods, and exported to the State goods to the value of £1,369,001. The
New South Wales exports to the United Kingdom in the same year were
valued at £10,222,422, while the imports from the same country were

£8,602,288. The total New South Wales exports to the British Empire for 1905 were £13,731,091,
and the imports £11,050,514. In the same period the exports to foreign countries were

£10,762,439, and the imports £3,434,609. The bulk of this foreign trade was done with France,

of commercial representatives in the East and South Africa to open up markets for our
products in those countries.

As showing the exact destination of our trade the following table of imports and exports
for 1905, and the countries to and from which the goods were carried, will be found of interest:—


While a large export trade already exists between the State of New South
Wales and European countries, the United States, and the west coast of
South America, every effort is being made to improve the trade relations
with Canada and the United States, and other countries. It is, however,

in the direction of the Orient that a very large volume of trade may open up for New South
Wales in the future. India now receives a considerable quantity of timber and horses, and
trade in copper and other products is opening up.
The Japanese are already a manufacturing nation with respect to certain products. It
is anticipated, moreover, that as they, and also the Chinese, advance in modern ideas, there
will in the future be increased inquiries for wool, meat, and grain from these countries. The
exports of frozen meat are without doubt on the increase from Australia, and a very large
proportion is from New South Wales. There is always a possibility that European countries
which at present practically prohibit the importation of meat, will see their way to alter their
policy, and thus open a further extended field for Australian meat. South Africa receives
large quantities of mutton and beef, and there is also considerable trade with that country in
butter, grain, hour, timber, and frozen poultry and rabbits.
Trade is opening up with the Philippine Islands and China to a considerable extent,
and also with the various island groups of the Pacific. And it is anticipated that "hen cold
storage depots have become established at the leading ports, a considerable business will be
done in frozen meats, butter, cheese, concentrated milk, and possibly fruit. While the staple
food in the East appears to be rice, it is gathered from reports by the Commercial Agent
representing New South Wales, that there is a disposition to vary the food, and consequently
wheat and flour, and in some instances meat, are coming more into general use. Hotels in
the East, at such places as Shanghai. Kobe, and other important centres, are adopting
refrigerated storage in connection with their establishments, and this means that those who
desire Australian meat and game and fruits and other delicacies will be able to obtain them.
The population of Japan alone is over 40,000,000, and China about 400.000,000. There-
fore. when it is realised that the 3,000,000 on the vast island continent of Australia, with all

its varied resources, have a prospective market
of such magnitude in the East, apart from the
trade already done with Europe and America,
it becomes very evident that there is a larger
market opening up for the exportable surplus
of our products than under present circum-
stances the population of Australia can meet.

Export Trade.

The New South Wales Government some years ago established a cold
storage depot for the purpose of fostering the export trade in rabbits, hares,
poultry, and other food products, and of late years large freezing companies
have actively catered for this trade, which is assuming large proportions.
The trade in rabbits and hares is growing rapidly, 3,202,109 pairs of rabbits and hares being
exported from the State in 1905. The total value of rabbit and hare carcases and skins was
£186,325. The poultry treated for export numbered 17,616 head. As a matter of fact, very
large orders were offering for poultry, to which the supply of a suitable character was not
equal.
The following table shows the value of some of the principal exports from New South
Wales during the year 1905 :

The Means of
Export.
So far as the means of export are concerned, the following great steamship
companies have extensive establishments at Sydney, and passenger and
mail steamers are despatched and arrive to regular time-table ;—Peninsular
and Oriental Steam Navigation Company; Orient Royal-Mail Steam
Navigation Company; Nord-Deutscher Lloyd; Messageries Maritimes; The White Star Line ;
The Aberdeen Line ; A. and A. Line ; Oceanic Company ; Canadian Australian Line ; Lund’s
Blue Anchor Line ; Eastern and Australian Steamship Company, Limited, for Manila, China,
and Japan ; also the China Navigation Company ; The Fcderal-Houlder-Shire, and Bucknall
Lines ; Tyser Line, Limited ; German Australian Steamship Company ; Adelaide Steamship
Company, Limited ; Howard Smith’s Line; Huddart Parker and Company Proprietary,
Limited ; Australian Despatch Line; Arch. Currie and Company’s Lines ; Ocean Steam-
ship Company, Limited; Commonwealth Line; Illawarra and South Coast Steam
Navigation Company, Limited ; The North Coast Steam Navigation Company, Limited ;
the Newcastle and Hunter River Steamship Company, Limited; and many others.
The Interstate and coastal steamers are fitted with the most modern appliances for the
comfort of passengers, and satisfactory carriage of goods, including freezing space for perishable
products.
In 1905 the volume of shipping entered reached a total tonnage of 4,697,511,
while the clearances reached a total of 4,684,108 tons. Various influential
associations, representing different branches of trade, have been established,
the most important being the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, established

CHAPTER IX.
Means of Communication.
EW South Wales has a valuable asset in its railway
property, and as the iron roads are State-owned,
111 they can be devoted primarily to the development
% ■ of the great natural resources of the State, and to
assisting settlers in opening up the country.
The railway history of New South Wales commenced
just half a century ago, and, having regard to its popu-

SECRETARY, RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS.
lation, the State has made much progress in the extension of its lines. To-day it has 3,370 i
miles of railway in operation, serving a total population of 1,504,700, or 1 mile to every
446 inhabitants, and as a general indication that this is relatively a substantial measure of
enterprise, it mav be mentioned that Great Britain has 1 mile to every 1,822 inhabitants.
The railways are built to the standard gauge of the world —4 ft. 8| in., and are equipped
with rolling stock that compares favourably, local circumstances being taken into account,
with that existing in any other country.
New South Wales is well provided with means of communication, and
every centre of importance may be said to be within reach of reasonable
transit facilities. Outside the railway area its eastern boundary is washed
by the waters of the Pacific, and at intervals rivers or harbours provide

ports for the coastal steamer services which run up and down the coast, enabling produce
to be taken at a small cost to the metropolitan markets.
Railways also assist to a large extent in providing facilities for coastal settlers, as north
and south from the capital the iron roads extend for considerable distances, as will be seen
from the map which indicates the railways of the State.
It is, however, inland that the railways have their chief mission, and where they have
been .of the greatest value in developing the resources of New South Wales. Coastwise,


Nature has provided a waterway which, by permitting of convenient communication, has
enabled the rich coastal lands to be advantageously worked ; but the cultivation of the inland
areas has only been rendered commercially profitable by the judicious system of railway
extension which successive Governments have projected, and it has been possible by State
ownership to make the principal object of these inland extensions to assist settlers in the
cultivation of the soil and generally to foster the producing interests. This has been done
in the first instance by carrying the fines into districts which were capable of development,
and then by reasonable railway charges to induce settlement and permit of profitable cultivation.
The railways have not been built purely as a commercial speculation.
While a reasonable return has been looked for, there has been no desire
for profits above the interest on the cost of the lines; and as profits
have followed increased settlement and traffic, the charges have been

brought down to the simple interest standard. As an instance of this, it may be stated,
EXPRESS PASSENGER TRAIN
that during the seventeen years the Commissioners have been in office, since they have
power to administer the railways on a business basis, while keeping in view national
considerations, the reductions in rates on goods equal at least half a million sterling per
annum.
The railways now reach in length 3,370 i miles, and were first strategically laid out by
main lines south, west, and north, to provide the benefits of railway communication over the


greatest area of country; but now that the main directions have been covered, a greater desire
is shown to construct shorter feeding lines which will tap fertile areas and give facilities for
the new settler to have an easy and profitable means of getting his produce to market after
harvest.
These main lines stretch to the southern border at Albury, 392 miles, with south-west
branches to Hay, 460 miles, and Finley, 454 miles ; west to Bourke and Brcwarrina, 508 and
518 miles respectively, or mid-west to Condobolin, 335 miles ; north to the border at Wallan-
garra, 492 miles, and to Inverell (north-west), 509 miles. These mileages are mentioned simply

to indicate the splendid distances covered by the main lines, and to show the room available
for expansion in regard to settlement, since outside the metropolis the population on an area
of 198,848,000 acres is still less than 1,000,000.

which are excellently suited for traffic at moderate speeds, and which can be laid down in
ordinary country at about £2,000 per mile. Australia has always been willing to recognise
the advantages of providing facilities in advance of dense settlement, as she allowed the
selection of land before survey, and where fair prospects exist the early settler mav
reasonably look for facilities being provided to meet and second his own pioneering
endeavours.
Reference has been made to the mileage, and a few figures may be given
as to the results. In the last financial year, ending 30th June, 1905, the
transactions may be summarised as under :

In passing, it may be said that the losses or damage to goods in transit have been
extremely low, while the immunity from accidents, in proportion to the number of passengers
carried, will compare favourably with that enjoyed by any other railway system. This
has not been the experience of one year, but
of many years, and indicates practically the
soundness of the road-bed, the excellence of the
vehicles, and the general care of the railway
administration and staff in faithfully observing
the first duty of all railway managers —the
safety of the travelling public.

In regard to the tonnage carried, it is gratifving to record the rapid increase
that has taken place in connection with the produce hauled. Ten years ago
the total under this head was put down at 356,174 tons, while last year the
tonnage was 662,729, a figure which illustrates, together with the increased
area under crop, the greater facilities given by the extension of the lines,

as well as indicating the encouragement given by the railway administration to production.
One principle that has been followed has been to diminish the rates rapidly in proportion to
distance, so as to enable distant areas to compete in the principal markets. For 100 miles,
wheat pays, and can afford to pay, Id. per ton per mile ; for 400 miles the difficulty of distance
is regulated by the reduction of the rate to less than £d. per ton per mile; and, consequently,
the newer settler, who has to take his holding farther back from the coastal markets, is placed

on a reasonable footing to compete with others who may be favoured by a shorter haul. The
rates for produce—truck loads —for relative distances from the country to”the”sea-board, are
as under :
100 miles .. .. .. .. .. .. Bs. 4d. per ton.
200 miles .. .. .. .. .. .. 11s. Bd. „
300 miles .. .. .. .. .. .. 12s. Bd. ~
400 miles .. .. .. .. •. .. 13s. 6d. „
For hay, straw, chaff, and green fodder, even lower rates prevail, and in order to encourage
high-class farming and production, manures are carried at the low rates applicable to produce.
The producer also has the benefit of reasonable rates in getting his implements to his land ; for
instance, a truck load of agricultural machinery is carried 300 miles for £2 4s. 4d. per ton.


The interests of the fruit-grower, market gardener, or dairy farmer, who
would, as a rule, settle nearer the larger centres of population, have had
equally liberal consideration. Fruit and vegetables are taken at a rate of
lid. per case (say 60 It), fruit) for 30 miles, or 2Jd. for 54 miles. Milk is

carried by passenger train 40 miles for Id. and 200 miles for 2d. per gallon. Butter, single
packages, is conveyed 50 miles for Is. per cwt. (or 13s. 9d, per ton), or 200 miles for 2s. 3d.
per cwt. (or 48s. 2d. per ton); while the thrifty house-wife may get her poultry to market at
a rate that enables a good return to be made, the Department supplying a coop capable of
holding 12 pairs of fowls or ducks, and carrying them 50 miles for 2£d. per pair, 100 miles
for 4£d., or 300 miles for per pair.
The Commissioners have been able to give these reasonable facilities largely by the
superiority of the rolling stock used. Locomotives have been adopted which haul immense
loads, the modern goods engine moving 700 tons at 15 miles per hour on a grade of one in 100,
while waggons have been built with a high loading capacity to the tare ; a waggon, for instance,
weighing 5 tons 18 cwt. having a capacity of 15 tons, or a larger vehicle carrying 24 tons on a
tare of 11 tons. The Commissioners are, therefore, enabled to take big paying loads and to
afford low freights.
The train services are frequent and the carriage accommodation most
comfortable, so that the settler is in easy communication with the principal
centres and able to obtain any necessary facilities for social or commercial
intercourse. The ordinary fares arc reasonable, while periodically excursion

trains are run to and from all stations at Id. per mile for the return journey (£d. per mile
each way).
The passenger business is relatively to the settler a matter of less moment than the more
vital question of cheap goods freights, but his comfort is greatly enhanced by convenient coaching
facilities with parcel arrangements that are within popular reach, and both the postal parcels
as well as the railway parcels rates have been fixed throughout to assist inland settlement
as far as it consistently can be done. That both have met demands is evidenced by the big
traffic under both heads. The number of passengers carried—suburban and country—have
already been quoted ; while the parcels railway business last year yielded £145,995.

CHAPTER X.
Industrial Expansion and Trade.
HE discovery of gold in 1851 may bo said to mark the
beginning of the industrial history of New South
| Wales. Nevertheless, it must not be thought that the
period from the establishment of the Colony in 1788 up
jl to that time was one of stagnation, for there were times
of considerable commercial activity and speculation,
especially during the second half.
As regards the condition of the workers, it may be
said that the period was distinguished by the scarcity
BY H. A. SMITH, F.S.S.,
statistician’s office.
of labour and the high wages paid, while at the same time the lot of the labourer was severe.
Rents were high, as were prices of commodities, especially those which were imported.
Transport and communication were restricted, and, consequently, trade did not increase at
all largely. Agriculture was, of course, necessary in order to supply the needs of the early
settlers, but the progress was not great, as in 1850 the area under cultivation was only 197,000
acres. Manufacture of articles for local consumption was carried on, and the progress may
be measured from the statement that there were 36 industrial establishments and 38 mills
in 1829, and 133 establishments and 172 mills in 1848. The principal industries were cloth
factories, tanneries, and breweries in the first-mentioned year, with the addition of potteries,
meat-preserving works, and iron foundries in the second.
Early in the period, the beginnings of the great pastoral industry were made, so that by
1850 there were in the State over 13,000,000 sheep, nearly 2,000,000 cattle, and a considerable
number of horses and pigs. The export of wool rose quickly from 175,400 lb. in 1821, to
2,000,000 lb. in 1830, and 14,000,000 lb in 1850. Towards the end, especially after 1840, immi-
gration was encouraged in every way, so that the population increased rapidly, and settlement
spread.
a


Gold was discovered in 1851, and the ensuing seven years were marked by
rapid growth and great change. The depression which had existed for
some years previously was swept away, and industrial conditions were
revolutionised. The rush of men to the gold-fields especially those in

labour was exhausted, and most branches of industry were at a standstill. Ihe period covered
by these eight or nine years during which the gold-fever raged also had a great economic
effect upon the condition of the labouring classes. Previously, the standard of living had
been measured by that prevailing in England, but this was all changed, and the Australian
worker established a standard for himself, which is still maintained, without reference to am
other countrv. The gold-fields attracte 1 men of many different occupations, in the prime
of life, and most of these after the excitement abated naturally turned to their old fallings
for employment, while some abandoned their search for gold in favour of other branches of th*
mining industry, and thus helped to develop the mineral resources of the ( olony.

In 1853 a regular steam service on the rivers Murray and Darling was inaugurated.
This had the effect of greatly lowering the cost of transport, and helped materially to open
up the great western division. Exploration in the north-western part of the State was carried
on, many fine stretches of country being discovered and made available for settlement. Moat
of the land was taken up for grazing purposes, and in
1854 the purchase of land for agricultural purposes
had almost entirely ceased.

hand, the miners required to be fed, and thus
created a large demand for meat. In 1852 there
were about 7,000,000 sheep in the Colony, and in
1861 about 6,000,000, so that the dearth of labour
and the demand for meat between them had de-
creased the flocks by one million during the ten
vears.

Agriculture was greatly neglected during this time. In 1840 there were 126,000 acres
under cultivation, while fourteen years later there were only 6,000 more. In 1846 there had
been 183,000 acres under crop, so that the industry actually retrogressed during the height of
the gold fever. The effect on the manufacturing industry was also detrimental at first, although
the subsequent revival was due to the supply of labour drawn from those who had immigrated
to the gold-fields. The number of mills and industrial establishments increased regularly
from 266 in 1845 to 388 in 1850, then declined to 286 in 1854, after which there was a recovery,
and the number in 1858 was 164. No information is available as to the number of hands
employed. During the period from 1845 to 1850 the population increased by 46 per cent.,
and from 1850 to 1858 by 74 per cent.
The large influx of people into Australia led to improved internal com-
munication and means of transport, while the introduction of steam

developed trade, and opened up new markets for local produce. Up to 1852 the trade of
New South Wales, especially in the imports, was very irregular, but from 1852 to 1858 the
imports advanced from £1,900,000 to £6,059,000. The exports did not vary much, being
valued at a little over £4,000,000. The imports comprised manufactured goods and luxuries,
and the exports almost wholly were raw materials and gold. For the first few years after the
discovery of gold the export returns were greatly affected by the quantity of gold sent away,
but the industry rapidly declined, owing principally to the depletion of the more easily worked


deposits and the superior attractions of the Victorian fields. During the eight years ending
1858 the value of gold exported varied from the maximum, £2,660,946 in 1852, to the
minimum, £654,594 in 1855.
As might have been expected, there was a reaction after the excitement
of the gold discoveries, and the community, while recovering, was naturally
somewhat restless. Employment was difficult to obtain, speculation was
quiet, and it began to be recognised that the Colony must look in other

directions for its future growth. Attention was thus naturally turned once more towards
agriculture, the area of land under cultivation increasing from 247,542 acres in 1859 to
302,138 in 1862. The manufacturing industries also made slight progress, the number of
establishments being 567 in 1860 and 645 in 1862.
During the next ten vears, that is from 1863, conditions were influenced more jwrhaps
by the vicissitudes of the seasons
than by any other cause, the
whole period being one of alter-
nate drought and flood, which
had a most harmful effect. The
expansion during these years was.
therefore, slow ; money became
dear, population was not at-
tracted in any numbers, land was
not taken up. nor was any sus-
tained effort made to develop the
resources of the Colony. In 1870
the production of gold only
reached £931,016, the lowest
value since 1858. The area of
land under cultivation was
417,84X4 acres, or less than six
years previously. It is satisfact-

ory to note, however, that the pastoral industry made fair progress. At the end of 1871 there
were over 16,000,(XX) sheep, 2,000,000 cattle, and 300,000 horses, while the export of wool
amounted to 65,500,(XX) lb., and was valued at 4J millions sterling. The value of tallow
exported was £246,000.
These depressing influences having come to an end, however, a change was
soon effected. The search for gold was once more carried on with vigor,
the production in 1872 amounting to £1,644,177, while copper and tin

[Chapter X.


of the primary industries. The price of wool was high, and consequently sheep-breeding
was very profitable. Also, about this time the necessity was seen for pushing on with
public works. Railways, roads, and bridges were built which opened up the country,
improved the means of transport, and thus made the markets more accessible to the producer.
Coincident with all these developments, wages were high, prices of food comparatively low,
and employment steady. Many persons were attracted to the State, and the rate of increase
of the population soon doubled. There was a great demand for labour, and to accommodate
it a vigorous immigration policy was carried on. All these conditions, which brought about a
great deal of real progress, prevailed until about 1883 or 1884, after which matters declined •
wages began to fall and employment was difficult to obtain, especially in the building trades
The expenditure on public works ceased to a large extent, and thousands of men were thrown
out of employment. In several of the collieries there were disputes and strikes, and in 1890
there were two great strikes, which very much disturbed the pastoral and shipping industries,
while in 1892 another strike threw idle the Broken Hill Silver Mines for three months.
The production of gold fell away to £317,000 in 1888. The price of wool was falling
steadily, but the industry was still very profitable up to 1884, as the flocks increased largely.
However, after that year, prices continued to fall, and this adversely affected the pastoral
industry, as there was little or no reduction in the price of production and cost of
transport.
The restriction of expenditure and the lack of activity in the primary
industries culminated in the financial crisis of 1893, which was more or less
inevitable. The works previously referred to were paid for out of capital

altogether evil. Although many persons suffered reverses of fortune, affairs, especially in
business, were placed on a much sounder basis than had been the case for several years.
Employment was scarce in the towns, and men were forced to turn their attention to the
primary industries, and the recovery would have been rapid but for the unfavourable
seasons which afflicted the pastoral industry. In 1891 the Colony possessed the largest
number of sheep on record, viz., just under 62.000,000, but during the next eight years this
number decreased to 36,200,000 In 1899 there was a sharp rise in the price of wool; it
declined again next year, but the number of sheep increased, only to decrease again during 1902
and 1903, owing to a prolonged drought. However, that has passed away, and in two years
the number of sheep has increased by nearly 40 per cent., from 28,500,000 to 39,500,000. The


price of wool which is now higher than at any time since 1899, promises to continue high;
the average weight of the fleece, which is now lb., is getting steadily heavier, and the
present prospect of the pastoral industry is, consequently, extremely hopeful.
After 1893, very much increased attention was directed to agriculture, so
that the area under cultivation grew rapidly, and doubled in the ten years
ending 1903. During one year, 1898, there was an increase of nearly
400,000 acres in the area. At the end of 1905 the are aunder cultivation

was 2,838,000 acres. The total is not perhaps very high, only amounting to about 2 acres
per head of population, but it must be remembered that, up to the present, New South Wales
has been essentially a pastoral country, and agriculture has ranked as only of secondary
importance, notwithstanding that there is plenty of good land, and that in spite of droughts
the defects of the climate are not serious. The chief drawback has been the size of the
country, and the difficulty of access to markets. The principal crop is wheat, the area
under which is considerably more than half the total. For many years the cultivation of

From this on to 1893 there was a decline, the number employed in that year being 42,000, but
there has been, since, a consistent increase each year, although a slight check was experienced
in 1902 and 1903 amongst the industries treating raw materials. The total number employed
in 1905 was 72,000, comprising 56,000 males and 16,000 females. Over 75 per cent, of the
females are employed in occupations which are peculiarly their own, namely, tailoring and
dressmaking.
The dairying industry has made great strides during the last ten years
or so, and is chiefly pursued in the coastal districts of New South Wales.
The advance has been most marked on the North Coast, which is most
suitable for dairying, and where, so far, only the outskirts have been

to 53,600,000 If)., the output for the latter year being the largest on record. Prior to 1890 a
considerable quantity of butter had to he imported to meet the local requirements. But from
that year an export trade was commenced, the surplus increasing from 281,000 lb. in 1890
to 4,000,000 If), in 1894, and 22,000,000 lb. in 1904. In 1905 there was a slight falling off.
The bulk of the produce is exported to the United Kingdom, hut a profitable market is also
found in South Africa and the East. The export of butter is now so large a factor of Australian
trade that the shipping companies in competing for its carriage have very much reduced then-
freights. The manufacture of cheese is not neglected, as 4,626,000 lb. were produced in 1905.


According to the returns of the last census, in 1901, the total population of New South
Wales was 1,359,133, of whom 266,973, or nearly 20 per cent., were employed in productive
industries, namely, 31,907 in pastoral pursuits, 18,135 in dairying ; 77,619 in agriculture ;
38,382 in mining; 6,811 in other primary pursuits; and 94,119 in manufactures and allied
processes. In 1861, just after New South Wales was restricted to its present boundaries,
the population was 350,860, and the number employed in productive industries about 96,000,
of whom 39,395 were engaged in agriculture ; 14,507 in pastoral pursuits ; 21,382 in mining ;
and 20,623 in manufactures.
During 1905 the total value of production from all industries was
£46,692,000, equivalent to £3l 11s. 6d. per head of population, a figure not
equalled by any country outside Australia. This tota' compared with
£15,379,000 the value in 1871 ; £25,180,000 in 1881; and £38,952,000 in 1901.

of Production.
It must be remembered, however, that prices were over 40 per cent, higher in 1871 than in
and about 22 per cent, higher in 1881. If the 1871 prices had prevailed in 1901 the value of pro-
duction would have amounted to over 65 millions, and if the 1881 prices, to nearly 57 millions.
The value represents the amount received by the producers for their output at the place of

1861. The surest test of the progress of a country like New South Wales, where the surplus
production is exported in the raw condition, is the rise or fall in the value of exports of
domestic produce, as these are affected by the rise or fall in prices. Wool is the great staple,
and any fluctuations in price are immediately reflected in the volume of trade ;
In 1861, 1,327 vessels were required to conduct the trade of New South
Wales. In 1905 the number had grown to 2,725. A more definite idea of
the growth of trade is obtained, however, when it is stated that in 1861 the

tonnage of the vessels that entered the ports of New South Wales was 366,236, while in 1905
the tonnage was more than twelve times as large, namely, 4,697,511. The size of vessels has
been constantly increasing. In the first year the average capacity of each vessel was 275
tons. At the present time the figure is 1.724 tons, and several vessels over 10,000 tons now
enter the port of Sydney regularly.


Of the total value of trade shown, about 40 per cent, is with the other Aus-
tralian States, the remaining 60 per cent, representing the direct oversea
trade. The total trade grew steadily in volume until the maximum point
per head of population was reached in 1891. The trade of that year, how-

ever, included exports of wool held over from the previous year on account of strikes. In
the years up to 1891 the imports, owing to external borrowings by the Government and private
investors, increased so that they often exceeded the exports. After 1891 the volume of
trade declined somewhat, and in 1901 the import figures were inflated owing to loading up by
merchants in anticipation of the Federal tariff, which was imposed towards the end of that
year. In 1905 the value of trade reached its highest point. The imports, exports, and the
exports of domestic produce were higher than ever before. Relatively, the exports of
domestic produce have never been exceeded and only approached once. Judged by the
volume of its exports per inhabitant, New South Wales compares favourably with any other
country in the world. An average export of over £2O per head is exceeded by no other
country except Belgium, which carries on a very large transit and re-export trade.

abroad. There is a large held open for the advancement of manufactures in New South
Wales, seeing that it produces the raw materials for many kinds of necessaries. The great
drawback lay in the smallness of the market on account of the limited population, but with
the federation of the Australian States and the consequent abolition of the State tariffs, the
market has been extended, and an improvement is seen in the expansion of the Interstate
trade of New South Wales. In 1899, just prior to federation, the exports to other Australian
States of New South Wales manufactured produce were worth about £380,000. In 1905 the
.value had grown more than fourfold, to £1,577,000. The chief trade of New South Wales, how-
ever, is with countries outside Australia. Of its total oversea trade during 1905, which was
valued at £38,978.653, that with the United Kingdom was worth £18,824,710; with Germany,
£3,635,685; France, £3,708,274; United States, £2,238,214; India and Ceylon, £2,048,137 ;
and New Zealand, £2,303,662.
In view of what has been already referred to, it is not surprising to find
that the great bulk of the domestic exports comprise goods more or less in a
raw state. ()t the total export during 1905, the following were the chief

from the other Australian States, ol which £13,356,420 was the produce of those States, and
£1,582,465 the value of British and foreign produce re-exported to New South Wales. Of the
Australian produce a large part was intended to be subsequently transhipped abroad. The
total imports for home consumption amounted to £20,606,672, or £l3 18s. Bd. per head of popu-
lation. A study of the import list suggests the great scope which exists for the cultivation of
products now imported, and especially the room for expansion in the manufacturing industries.

In addition to the oversea trade in home produce, there is a fairly large re-export trade
in provisions and manufactured articles of British and foreign production with New Zealand,
New Caledonia, Fiji, and the other islands of the Pacific, the value of such having amounted
to £578,966 in 1905,
All the facts which have been cited herein go to show how marked has been the advance
of New South Wales in all directions of productive industry. Notwithstanding the severe
trials she has had to undergo in the wav of adverse seasons and financial troubles, she has
managed to survive them all, and has come out after each one stronger than before. The
bad seasons have been followed by good ones and the recovery has been remarkable. Just
as is now the case, there has always been caution and lack of enterprise immediately after
a reverse, but this has quickly passed away, and it is hoped that the present high prices for
almost all staple produce will continue as an incentive to production, when there will be still
greater progress in all branches of industry, tending alike to the advancement of the State
and the prosperity of the whole community.

THE COAST DISTRICT.
jfCT- T may be safely asserted that New South Wales can produce.
Jj Pi within its own borders, almost everything that is needed
J Kjj for the sustenance, the comfort, and even the highest
luxury of mankind. This is due no less to its great
variety of soils than to its wide range of climate. The
high and regular rainfall of the North Coast District—so
to 75 inches—operating in combination with the genial
warmth of its mean summer temperature of 75° Fahr.,
and its mean winter mildness of 58° Fahr., upon the rich
alluvial soils of the Tweed, Brunswick, Richmond,
Clarence, Bellinger, and Macleay Rivers, has produced a luxuriance of vegetation which
may be compared with the jungles of tropical Africa, Asia, and South America. When this
natural wilderness has been subdued by man, it becomes the home of the sugar-cane, tea, coffee,
cotton, pineapple, mango, and most of the fruits, fibre plants, and other economic products
of sub-tropical regions.
Fertility of soil depends on much the same conditions in New South Wales as in older
countries—(l) sufficiency of plant-food, humus, and water; (2) a suitable admixture of clay
and sand to ensure good tilth ; and (3) good texture to allow percolation and capillary action.
The soils along the river banks, being the result of the decomposition of the igneous rocks forming
a large proportion of the mountain range that bounds their watershed, are so rich that they have
yielded heavy crops of sugar-cane, maize, and other exhausting crops for two generations
without the aid of manure. The undulating country, stretching from the coast to the foot-hills,
varies in quality according as it is derived from basalt, trap, granite, schists, or shales, or sand-
stone, but the great bulk of it, in its natural state, whether scrub or forest, gives valuable
timbers—teak, pine, bean-tree, cedar, rosewood, tallow-wood, and many others suitable for
fencing, for building, for street-paving, and for the finest cabinet work. Both scrub and
brush when cleared are soon covered with a pasture of native and exotic grasses so rich and
luxuriant that it has already made the North Coast a great rival to the South Coast, which
is the oldest dairying district of New South Wales.


Introduction
of Grasses.
The enterprise of settlers, aided and stimulated by the Department of
Agriculture, has introduced some grasses of such value that the dairying
capacity of many sections of this district has been raised to one beast per
acre, and even the once neglected hill-sides now run a beast to 5 acres without
aid from artificial feeding. In fact, nature has been so kind to the present generation of dairy
farmers on the North Coast that they do very little farming in the ordinary sense. They milk
the cows and take the milk to the nearest creamery, or separate it themselves and take the
cream to the nearest factory, but they do very little cultivation. They grow little hay, and few
fodder crops for green feed for summer or winter, when there may be a shortage of natural
grasses. They cut the paspalum grass for its valuable seed, but instead of conserving the straw,
either for feed or for bedding, many of them burn it or let it rot. If they grow a patch of maize

it is not often for green feed for the cattle, but for the grain for the Sydney horses ; the stalks,
the cobs, and the husks arc all burnt, and vast stores of fertility in the form of humus and
nitrogen are thereby driven off into the an.
Rich Soils
make
Poor Farmers.
The greater part of the Richmond River soils are of volcanic origin, over-
lying basalt. Taking the average of a number of analyses, the capacity
for water may be taken as 52 per cent.; the humus, 16 per cent.; phosphoric
acid, *3 per cent. ; nitrogen, -.'l per cent. ; lime, '2l per cent. ; potash, 08 pci
cent. The amount of the last mentioned element of fertility is not satis-
factory, but the other figures indicate a degree of fertility comparing well with the richest sugar-
cane soils of Queensland, and about three times as great as that of the average soils m the
neighbourhood of the metropolis. These rich virgin soils often make rich settlers but poor
farmers. In the older districts, where the soils have been impoverished by several generations


of thriftless men, different methods have now to be pursued, the aid of science is being invoked,
and a new class of farmers is being bred, who have to grow
feed for their cattle, manure their soil, conserve surplus fodder in
times of plenty, utilise by-products and all elements of fertility,
and generally conduct their farming operations on principles
approved by the centuries of experience of older lands. The
Wollongbar Experiment Farm of 400 acres, on the Richmond
River, is expected to do good work by introducing improved
varieties of fruits and crops already grown in the district, and
new ones of economic value ; by exhibiting improved methods
of farming, by providing good sires to raise the standard of the
dairy cattle, and by training a number of lads year by year in
the science and practice of sub-tropical agriculture. The average
area of the holdings in this district is 246 acres, and 73 per cent, of them all are held and worked
by the owners.
The country between the Macleay and Hunter Rivers contains a greater
proportion of sandstone spurs and ranges than that further north. The
valley of the Manning is very fertile, and enjoys a climate and rainfall which
make it one of the richest districts in the State, famous alike for its oyster-

beds and its maize crops. But there is also a fair amount of inferior land on the ridges and
among the mountain ranges that is valued at present more for its timber resources than for
its potentialities in pasture and crops. At the same time it is certain that much of the hilly
and ridgy country in this and other parts of New South Wales, that is now despised and rejected
bv our rather fastidious selectors, is in no way inferior to many districts of Europe which support
large populations by a system of intense culture, and that the day will come when, after all
the rich lands shall have been closely settled and fully developed, these tracts of soil of second
and third quality will be eagerly sought for by a more highly educated, more thrifty, and more
svstematic generation of agriculturists than the present, to whom the soil has hitherto presented
few problems needing more than brave hearts and strong arms.
The Hunter Valley is one of the oldest and still one of the most fertile
and prosperous districts of the State. The rich seams of coal which have
been developed very extensively near the mouth of this river have made

ill the old land. The great mineral wealth of the district has attracted a population of over
60,000, which will certainly grow, and the feeding of which will give scope to the agricultural
potentialities of the splendid country extending from Maitland to JVluswellbrook. Its deep
alluvial flats form the ideal home of lucerne, of which they yield as many as seven cuttings in
the year, each equal to about 1 ton of hay per acre. Yields of 80 to 120 bushels of maize per
acre are not uncommon. Dairying is, of course, very profitable, and, consequently, the capital
value of the land along the river’s banks has reached £2O to £4O per acre, even £BO being paid


for small choice blocks. Much of the valley is liable to Hoods, which follow heavy rains in the
upper part of the watershed, and a very rich dressing of silt is sometimes left behind to the
depth of 2 inches, which analysis shows to be so rich as to be equal to a manuring for most crops
for ten years. The farmers, would, however, prefer to miss both the flood and the silt, since
one may get coarse sand for his share, and another the rich fine silt the washings of farms
and hill-sides higher up the valley. The damage done to growing crops, and the hindrance to
the routine cultivation of
the farms more than
outweigh the benefit of
the extra 2 inches of top-
dressing, which may be
disregarded on soil which
is 20 to 50 feet deep. The

the coast 100 miles, and

Ayrshire or the Jersey, especially round Singleton, Muswellbrook, Aberdeen, Scone, and
Murrurundi, whereby more families are settled, more labour is needed, the gross yield per acre
has increased three to ten times, and the net profit is much larger, so that the capital value
is steadily appreciating. For the English farmer, who has capital enough to buy an improved
block of land, this fertile valley, with its rich soil, good and generally regular rainfall, equable
climate, proximity to good markets, settled conditions, and suitability for a good system of
mixed farming, presents attractions equalled by no other district in New South Wales, except,
perhaps, the South Coast district from Wollongong to Bega. Hut it is no place for the man
with small means, who expects to get a big estate for little money. The average area of
holdings in this district is 267 acres.
The section of the Coast District between the Hunter River and Wollongong,
embracing the Metropolitan area, has, for its chief geological features, the
great beds of Hawkesbury sandstone and Wianamatta shales. The Blue
Mountains, which bound this district on the west, consist almost entirely
of very bare sandstone ridges, with occasional outcrops of basalt at Mount

Area,
Hay, Mount Tomah, and Mount King George, giving rise to rich patches of red chocolate
soil that form veritable oases of rich vegetation amid the vast expanses of stunted and


gnarled trees, poor scrub, and characteristic vegetation, that invariably indicate the poor and
shallow soils of sandstone country.
Along the banks of the Hawkesbury, and in some gullies, there are deep
beds of alluvium, generally made up of sandy debris of the adjoining moun-
tains, mingled with some better stuff brought down by one of the tributaries
from the southern tableland. On these flats the comparative poverty of the

soil, chemically speaking, is amply compensated for by the depth, which gives an ideal foraging
ground for lucerne and all deep-rooting plants, which can go down to the cool pebbly subsoil
for moisture, and can explore, perhaps, 30 feet of light sandy loam in search of nutriment. Any
one who has seen the lucerne and maize and orchards of Emu Plains, Richmond, Windsor,
and other parts of the Hawkesbury valley, growing in light but deep sandy loam, will realise
that a comparatively poor but kindly soil, 10 to 20 feet deep, is preferable to a rich but shallow
soil lying on a harsh and impervious clay. This river, also, is very liable to heavy floods—
sometimes reaching 40 feet—which are capricious in their action, and sometimes very destruc-
tive. One part may be enriched with a fine silt, which is generally of a chemical value about
half that of the Hunter River, while another may be covered with a bed of water-worn boulders
and gravel of basalt and granite, and a third be smothered with a thick coating of coarse sand.
Generally floods are a dreaded evil, and no Hawkesbury farmer feels safe who has not some
high land behind his rich flats, to serve as a site for his house and farm buildings, and a refuge
for his stock in times of stress. The oldest farms in Australia are in this valley, which supplied
the food of the infant settlement round Sydney Cove over a century ago. Here also, near
Richmond, was started in 1891 the first Agricultural College in New South Wales, which is
slowly educating the conservative “ Cornstalks ” of this decadent district how to develop
the capabilities and restore the fertility of soils partially worn out.

chemically they are always deficient in phosphoric acid and lime, and generally less than one
third as rich in the elements of fertility as the soils of the North Coast.
H


LOADING HAY IN THE FIELD.
Aii average of a large number of analyses of sandstone soils counties of
Cumberland and Camden, made by the Chemist of the Department of Agriculture, shows that
they are generally acid in character, have a capacity for water of 50 per cent. ; humus, 7 to
11 per cent. ; lime, 4 per cent. ; potash, ‘066 per cent,; phosphoric acid, 437 per cent.;
and nitrogen, 433 per cent. The soils derived from the shales have generally twice as
much potash, slightly more lime and nitrogen, but considerably less phosphoric acid. The
whole district, 30 miles north, south, and west of Sydney, is of inferior agricultural quality, the
only patches and pockets of first-class soil being found in the vicinity of the rather numerous
dykes and outcrops of basalt and dolerite that occur in this area.
The proximity to the metropolis, however, gives even these third-rate soils
a value of their own for growing fruit and vegetables, for dairying, poultry
farming, and all forms of “petite culture.” With the aid of deep tillage, liming,
green manuring, good cultivation, intelligent fertilising, and drainage, these

soils can be greatly improved, their capacity for water increased, and they can be profitably
cultivated with the more remunerative crops. The new generation or the improved breed of
farmers—the product of all our Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Farms —is going to do
wonders with such soils as these, which are now shunned because not understood. To one
who has seen the intense culture of Italy, France, Germany, and Switzerland, where every
square yard of soil is made to produce something, where the grape-vines are trained in festoons
between the poplars that stand as posts in the dividing lines, where the steepest hill sides arc
terraced for the growth of—here an olive-tree, there a fig-tree, anon perhaps a few tomatoes —
to such a one little imagination is needed to see the whole of this coastal district, with its
glorious climate and rainfall of 30 to 60 inches, covered with thousands of small farms and
gardens, and supporting a dense population of prosperous and contented yeomen, whose boys
will gape in wonder when grandfather tells them how Sydney, when it had only 500,000


inhabitants at the close of the 19th century, had to depend largely on America for its canned
fruit and asparagus, and many of its implements, and on other States for much of its best bacon
and cheese, its jams and raisins and wines, its hops and barley and oatmeal, its manufacturers
of iron and wool, and many other necessaries of life. The average area of the holdings in this
Central Coast District is 54 acres, the smallest of any large district in the State, comprising as
it does many orchards and market gardens.
As we travel down the South Coast we traverse a tract of country between

At Nowra, the terminus of the railway, he may see Jerseys bred to such perfection that a

the Shoalhaven River may be found some Holsteins, which would recall to a Dutchman the
placid beauty of his home in Holland. In the rough and lovely country where the Shoalhaven
rises are great mineral riches ; along the banks near its mouth are alluvial deposits, which
have given splendid yields of lucerne, maize, potatoes, and meadow grasses for three
generations.
Below this river is a stretch of poor sandstone country, interspersed,
however, with outcrops of igneous rocks, which have made several good
patches at Tomeroug, Wandandian, and elsewhere. Sterility of soil may
arise from absence or deficiency of chemical elements necessary for plant

growth, bad mechanical conditions, or the presence of injurious constituents. Fortunately


neither this district nor any other in New South Wales is sterile owing to the last cause, as,
for example, the alkali lands of California are, but merely on account of deficiency of the
elements of fertility, especially phosphoric acid and lime. The time will come when even this
sandy and gravelly country will have a modest value for growing certain fibre-plants, and
trees for firewood and essential oils.
When one gets to the igneous rocks of the Ulladulla District, he finds a
very fertile but narrow strip of country, where well-grassed hills, the densely
timbered gullies in which the red cedar once flourished, a series of lagoons
well stocked with fish, and nestling amid trap ridges and fertile meadows,
all combine to make this one of the most charming spots in the State—an

ideal resort for the tourist, and a prosperous and restful district, famous for its stalwart
lads and bonny lasses, who commenced to swarm off from the parental home some thirty
years ago to subdue the big scrub of the northern rivers, and do their share in developing
the latent wealth of that rough and unknown district.
A COUNTRY SHOW-GROUND,

Devonshire.
To the south of Ulladulla there is a stretch of inferior soil at present valued
principally for its fine timber, in which settlement for dairying is sparse till
the Clyde River is reached. Then comes the rich Moruya District, well
watered and fertile, famous alike for its granite quarries and its rich pastures.
Further south we come to the Tuross River and the Bodalla estate, the scene of the pioneering
labours of Thomas Mort, one of the most far-seeing and public-spirited citizens that New South
Wales has produced. An Englishman arriving in this charming district might easily imagine
himself in Devonshire or Cheshire. It has long been favourably known for its quality of
cheese and bacon, and the fine strain of its Holstein cattle. The same industries have
been found to be peculiarly adapted to the whole of the coast district as far south as Two-
fold Bay, which, in the early days of the Colony, was the centre of the whale-fishing industry.
The granitic outcrop round the Bega River makes rich flats, which produce heavy crops of
ucerne and maize, and rarely suffer from the short dry spells that visit even the highly favoured
South Coast. The undulating country on both side-, of the river gives good pasture to the
large herds of Jerseys and Ayrshires which make Bega a household name for excellence of dairy
produce.

districts only 31 per cent. The aim of statesmen is to do everything possible by judicious
legislation, by the education of the youth, and by every legitimate encouragement to rural
workers, to promote agricultural settlement, and thereby alter these percentages.
The development of the coastal district during the past thirty years has been in every
way satisfactory. While the average area of the 75,672 holdings in the State is 635 acres, that
of the half (37,156), which are on the Coast, is slightly over 200 acres, being 246 for the North
Coast, and as low as 124 in Raleigh, the best country in it, 223 acres for the whole of the South
Coast, but only 168 in the Camden District; 154 in Northumberland, and 46 in the County
of Cumberland.

communication, all have combined to make farming more profitable and more stable, to
increase the social attractions of country life, and incidentally to reduce the “ living area ”
needed in the agricultural and dairying districts. The incidence of a land tax on unimproved
values, and the oft recurring dread of a graduated land tax, have had their influence in bringing


about the subdivision of the large estates aggregated under the provisions of unwise land laws,
and the closer settlement of the coast district, also the tablelands where mixed farming—wheat
with sheep—is beginning to do for that district what dairying has done for the coast.
Thirty years ago there was a dread of over-production in butter, but the

practically an unlimited outlet for all our dairy produce. When, after forty years of continuous
cropping and grazing without any fertilising, the good soils of the early settled districts showed
signs of grave deterioration, people abandoned the old farms and sought for new land. The
Government met the crisis by organising a scheme of agricultural education, establishing
in 1891 a college and experimental farm at Richmond for the metropolitan area, another in
1892 at Wollongbar for sub-tropical districts, and in 1897 a stud farm at Berry for the improve-
ment of dairy herds, whereby the younger generations have been enabled to learn how to deal
with new and more difficult conditions. Improved communication by road, by rail, and by
sea—has brought better markets, and new industries have been opened up.

of stranded Italians, who were thrown on to our hospitality by the failure of the De Ray
colonising expedition, got an opportunity of settling on some waste land of sandstone and
shale formation between Woodburn on the Richmond and Harwood on the Clarence. The
soil seemed to consist principally of stiff clays, hungry sands, and ironstone gravel. No self-
respecting New South Welshman of the old school would take such land as a gift with the
attached condition of residence and effective occupation. But these forty-six Italians, inured


to the much harder conditions of their crowded country, gladly selected 3,030 acres of this
unpromising soil, and settled with their boys and girls and babies to the total of 202 souls.
They were thrifty and industrious, sober and persevering, and well versed in all branches of
intense culture. To-day the whole place —well called “ New Italy is like a slice of old Italy

THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL TABLELANDS.
From the South Coast district we climb up the spurs of the Monaro Ranges, and
reach the Southern Tableland, a region of high plateaux, intersected by ranges of mountains,
one of which—the Snowy Range—rises to 7,350 feet in Mount Kosciusko. The Tableland
falls rapidly away towards the coast, gradually towards the Hunter Valley in the north, and
very gently towards the great plains in the west. From Bombala to Cooma we find rocky

fruits, and mixed farming, with here and there a good tract of well-watered plains, well adapted
for dairying on special lines. The winter climate closely resembles that of Great Britain, but
the summer shows a higher range of temperature. Frosts begin as early as April, and persist
often to November, making the summer too short for crops like maize, and too risky for many
fruits. The rainfall varies between 25 and 34 inches, the greater half of the rain falling in the
first three and the last three months of the year.
At Cooma, which is over 2,600 feet above the sea, we get the branch
railway that leaves the main southern line at Goulburn, which is slightly
over 2,000 feet above the level of Sydney. The whole length of this branch
line (130 miles) is through hilly and stony country, well adapted to fruit-
culture and grazing, and here and there good stretches of high-class agricul-

grown successfully with 16 inches of rain, provided always the greater part of it falls
between May and November. The experience of South Australia amply supports this theory.
From Harden a connecting line goes north to join the Great Western line, and passes
Young, Grenfell, Cowra, and Blayney, each the centre of large areas of undulating country
of granitic, basaltic, or slate formations, timbered with white and yellow box, pine, and some
eucalyptus, and peculiarly adapted for the growth of all cereals, fruits ranging from cherries
and apples to peaches and grapes. Where a few years ago the merino was sole king, and a few
pastoralists held areas of 10,000 to 50,000 acres for grazing alone, to-day there are hundreds
of farmers growing wheat on the “ shares ” system, or getting a living by cultivating areas
of 100 to 300 acres on a system of mixed farming suited to the conditions of the climate. The
process of subdividing these large grazing estates is going on, and in this way hundreds of
families will be provided for, the return per acre will be increased fourfold, the social advantages
of closer settlement will brighten the lives of the farmers and their wives and families, and
agriculture will become more stable ; the railways will earn higher interest, and the general
prosperity of the whole State will be increased. Cowra is the site of an Experimental Farm,
which is expected to do yeoman service in solving many of the problems of the farmers on the
tablelands enjoying a rainfall of 25 to 30 inches. Especially valuable are the experiments
here carried on with regard to the breeding and fixing varieties of wheat best adapted to the
climatic conditions of New South Wales.
If we follow the Southern line from Harden through Cootamundra, Junee,
Wagga Wagga, to Albury, on the Murray River, we see a class of land —
a rich red loam—of which there are no less than 20,000,000 acres in the
State, all admirably suited for a system of farming with wheat and sheep,
and much of it ideal country for the growing of olives, peaches, apricots,

figs, apples, prunes, pears, and pre-eminently grapes, from which are made raisins and sweet
wines of first quality. At Wagga Wagga there is an Experiment Farm and School, second
to none in Australia for the practical value of the work done on the farmers’ behalf. Its results


in growing and drying fruits, its experiments with cereals as to manuring, better cultivation,
new varieties and improved methods, have been of great educational value, and consequently
it is always full of farmers’ sons anxious for a good training in practical agriculture. From
Cootamundra one branch line leads south into rather hilly country through Gundagai to Tumut,
a wonderfully fertile district, producing tobacco, maize, and potatoes, with a marvellous range
of fruits, including strawberries equal to the best grown in Aberdeenshire, cherries and berries
of all sorts as good as one could get in K.ent, and yet peaches and tomatoes and grapes such
as an Englishman would expect to grow under glass. Another branch line runs north to
Temora and Wyalong, through typical wheat country equal to anything within the 20-inch
rainfall belt.
From Junee a branch line goes west 60 miles down a gentle slope of 400
feet to Narrandera, whence another branch goes south-west for 100 miles,
falling another 200 feet to Jerilderie, Berrigan, and Finley, round each of
which, in spite of a low rainfall, wheat-growing is making headway. From

grazing country, and capable of enormous development in the production of cereals, fruit,
wines, and dairy products, by means of irrigation from the river—a dream which one of
the largest landowners, Sir Samuel McCaughey, is even now bringing within the realm of
practical agriculture after years of patient endeavour. Away 150 miles east of this, amid the
hilly country near Bowning, is the site of the great reservoir at Barren Jack (a corruption


of the aboriginal term Burren Yeack—a precipitous mountain), in which the Government
propose to impound a great sheet of 20 square miles of water 200 feet deep, larger than Sydney
Harbour, which will replenish the Murrumbidgee and subsidiary channels in summer, and thus
irrigate by gravitation such an area of good soil as will support 100 families where one now
lives its lonely existence, and all will be co-related to the canals already made by the private
enterprise of a patriotic and far-seeing citizen.
The
Wheat-belt’s
Western Fringe.
From Blayney, where the Western line of railway junctions with the branch
line that connects it with the Southern railway, we may travel through
excellent wheat country for 129 miles as far as Dubbo and Trangie on the
north-west, the tableland falling away from 2,800 feet to 700 feet in that
distance. Orange, 20 miles beyond Blayney, is the centre of a district
famed for its English fruits and mixed farming. A branch line goes thence west 139 miles
to Condobolin, sloping away 2,200 feet in that distance, and throughout the whole distance
there is noticeable a growing practice of breaking up the large grazing estates into farms of
STANDING CROP, WAGGA WAGGA.


300 to 1,200 acres, adapted for a system of mixed
farming —wheat and sheep. A reference to the rain-
fall map will show that generally the country which
is below 800 feet on the western slopes of this table-
land, is also outside the 20-inch rainfall limit, which
is usually recognised as the wheat belt. This must be
taken with modifications, as the experience of South
Australia, and also of some parts of the Riverina in
the south-west part of New South Wales, proves that
wheat may be profitably grown with a 16-inch rainfall,
provided the greater part of the rain comes in the spring and early summer, not in the first
half of the year. The tendency of the past twenty years has been to push the wheat zone out
farther and farther west, where the red loamy soil is so rich and peculiarly adapted for wheat-
growing, that the risk of an absolute failure, perhaps once in seven years, is deliberately taken.
On the return journey by the Western line, from Blayney to the metropolis,
we pass through Bathurst (2,200 feet), one of the districts first settled after
the road was found over the Blue Mountains ninety years ago. The Experi-
ment Farm established here twelve years ago has demonstrated the possibilities
of the granitic soils of the district for the growing of fruit, wheat, barley, and

other crops, and the rearing of high-class crossbred sheep and lambs for the English market.
From Wallerawang a branch line goes north through limestone country, already the home
of large industries in lime and cement, to Kylstone, Havilah, and Mudgee—long famous alike
for the merino flocks which find an ideal home in this hilly country, and for the dairy herds
which thrive on the intervening rich lucerne flats.
The line in returning from Bathurst to Sydney has to ascend 1,300 feet in 70 miles,
traversing country of inferior agricultural value, but rich in coal, iron, limestone, and other
mineral wealth, till the poor sandstone ridges of the Blue Mountains are reached. Their lovely
gullies are highly prized as tourist resorts in summer, alike by the people from the moist and
muggy coast district and by those from the dry western plains. The eastern slope falls 3,000
feet in 30 miles, presenting a succession of country homes of Sydney residents, but no land
capable of agricultural settlement till the level of the Nepean, the upper course of the
Hawkesburv, is reached, and we enter the central coast districts in which Penrith marks the
limit of the metropolitan area.
The average area of the 5,052 holdings in the southern tableland is 750 acres, and of the
5,621 on the south-western slope is 841 acres, of the 8,228 on the central tableland is 407 acres,
and of the 3,684 on the central western slope is 642 acres. The total area of land in these
tablelands and western slopes, which has been alienated by the Crown, is over 14,200,000 acres,
divided among 27,585 occupiers, a number which will have to be largely increased before it
can be said that this fine tract of country is effectively and advantageously settled.


THE NORTHERN TABLELAND.
The Northern tableland may be defined as that which is north of the Hunter River
Valley, traversed by the Great Northern railway in its gradual climb from Muswellbrook (at
480 feet) through Murrurundi (1,550 feet) to Werris Creek, from which a branch line goes
north-west through the heavy black soil of the Liverpool Plains, passing Gunnedah, Boggabri,
Narrabri, and Moree, considerable centres of rich agricultural potentialities. At the last-
mentioned there is an Experiment Farm, intended to show the possibilities of irrigation by
means of artesian water, and the results already achieved give great promise of what may be
attained by the aid of the vast stores of underground water when applied with skill and know-
ledge to the rich soils of these north-western slopes.
The line here turns abruptly to the east, and ascends through very good
country, blessed with a rising rainfall, till it gets to Inverell, at an elevation
of 1,900 feet, with a rainfall of 30 inches, the centre of one of the most fertile
districts in Australia. This is the scene of the first experiment in closer
settlement by the Government of New South Wales, where the Myall Creek

estate of 66,688 acres was resumed and subdivided into 138 farms, which have been sold at an
average price of £2 Bs. Bd. an acre, and would be worth seven times as much with such soil,
climate, and rainfall, if within easy access
of a great market. Between Inverell and
Glen Innes there is a rise of 1,600 feet in
42 miles, through rich and well-watered
basaltic valleys, which are now held by a
few graziers, but will soon support a large
population. The main line, after leaving

growing. Its growth and development have been much checked by the proximity of the Peel
River estate of 330,000 acres, which has reared many sheep but few men and women. This is
now being gradually cut up into suitable areas of 500 acres for grazing and mixed farming, down
to 100 acres of rich river flats fit for lucerne and maize, which will readily sell at £4 to £l5 per
acre, respectively, and will some day support a population of at least 800 families.
The history of this estate is typical of the process of development through
which many similar districts are passing—the aggregation of immense areas
of land of high potential value, but cheap in price because of its remoteness
from any market, and its fitness for grazing only; gradually comes appreci-

intense cultivation, the introduction of new industries, and the settlement of a comparatively
large population.
When gold was discovered fifty-five years ago, New South Wales, which then included
the present States of Victoria and Queensland, had a population of not more than 150,000.
It was considered by many to be overcrowded. The agricultural output had overtaken the
demand. Prices were low, wages were reduced, and the star of Australia’s prosperity
seemed to have reached its zenith. The discovery of gold at once changed all that.

to help the farmers of this district to solve the problems of their stiff black soil and their
rigorous climate. The Great Northern railway reaches a height of nearly 4,500 feet at Ben

situate about midway between Sydney and Brisbane, comprising 96,000 acres, falling from
3,100 feet above the sea to 1,600 feet, covered with luxuriant vegetation, rich and fertile, well-
watered and temperate in climate. This fine area of Crown lands is now made accessible by
good roads, going upwards 65 miles to Armidale, and downwards 19 miles to Cofi’s Harbour
and the Bellinger River; part has been subdivided into 142 areas, ranging from 140 to 320
acres, suitable for dairying and.-mixed farming, and will be made available for purchase under
the provisions of the new tenure —Conditional Purchase Lease—before the close of this year
(1906). The average area of the 3,959 holdings on the Northern Tableland is 594 acres.
i


THE NORTH-WESTERN SLOPE.
The slope of the Northern Tableland towards the west is a gradual one, forming the
watershed of the Mclntyre, Gwydir, and Namoi Rivers, which go to make the Darling, the
river which waters the great western plains, and passes Brewarrina, Bourke, Wilcannia, Menindie,
and Wentworth, where it unites with the Murray. The part of the north-western slope which
extends to Moree, Walgett, Narrabri, Gunnedah, and Coonamble, embraces a very important
section of the State, which gradually falls in elevation from 1,500 to 600 feet, has a rainfall
similarly diminishing from 30 to 16 inches, and marks the transition between the farming
districts of the tableland and the purely pastoral settlements of the Western Plains. The
possibilities of irrigation by artesian water are being proved by experiment farms at several
Government bores at Moree, Walgett, Pera, Native Dog, Barringun, Enngonia, and Belalie,
and on a larger or smaller scale at several hundred private bores. Though the amount of
available artesian water must necessarily be limited, it has already been proved to be ample
to water the greater part of the western country for sheep, and to make hundreds of oases,
varying in area from 50 to 600 acres, where such supplies of fodder can be grown as will greatly
diminish the terrors of our recurring droughts.
The average area of the 3,718 holdings on the North-western Slope is 1,137 acres. The
agriculturist is fast encroaching on the pastoralist in this part of the country, and as the large
areas now held from the Crown, under lease, gradually revert to the State, they will certainly
be demanded by the coming generation for closer settlement, and the area of 235,114 acres
now cultivated out of 4,228,792 alienated, will then be largely increased.
TOBACCO SHED NEAR TAMWORTH.


THE WESTERN PLAINS.
The Western Plains embrace a large part of the State which is very even in surface,
slopes gradually from 500 feet to the level of the sea, has a very rich soil needing only water
to develop its fertility, but enjoys a low rainfall—ranging from sto 16 inches per annum. In
the north-western part there are 965 holdings, with an average area of 2,364 acres ; in the central
part of these Western Plains the number of holdings is 2,034, and the average size 1,865 acres ;
wdiile in the Riverina, in the south-west, the average of the 4,124 holdings is 2,933 acres—which
greater figure is not to be taken as an indication that the climate, soil, and other circumstances
of this district demand a larger “ living area,” but merely that the provisions of the Crown
Lands Act of 1861 were more freely utilised here than elsewhere, and the joint operations of
pastoralists and various banking corporations, resulted in the alienation of immense areas of
the best pastoral land in the State, and in the aggregation of many vast estates, larger than
European principalities. Natural evolution, hastened by man’s impatience, will cure this evil,
and we shall soon have, in this splendid grazing country, more than one landholder to each

as it surely will in the near future, there will be plenty of room for new settlers and immigrants
on the tablelands and western slopes. For the present, closer settlement must proceed west-
wards from the coast, more in obedience to natural laws than to political theories and economic
principles.

USE OF FERTILISERS.
One of the most encouraging signs in the consideration of the future possibilities of
agriculture and fruit-growing in New South Wales is the increasing use of fertilisers. J here
are farms in the oldest settled districts which have been cropped for eighty years without the
assistance of any manure ; many parts
of the Metropolitan area and the South
Coast were cropped for wheat and other
cereal crops for twenty years, till the rust
made them unprofitable forty years ago,
and they have been used for grazing ever
since, without any top-dressing, or even

the droppings of the milking yards and bails were seldom conserved and utilised, more
often were washed down into the nearest creek, to give a delicate flavour to the cows
water supply; the wood ashes and waste matter of the household, fowl-houses, and
piggeries were seldom systematically used, more often allowed to become a menace to the
health and comfort of the family ; green manuring was unknown ; and generally the prosperity
of farming made men thriftless and indifferent to the problem of impoverished soil which their
children would have to face. The bone and sinew of the country, in the form of bone-dust
and dried blood, were being exported to New Zealand and other countries. The waste products
of the cities were taken out to sea, or otherwise criminally wasted. The sulphate of ammonia
of the gasworks was all sent to Mauritius to grow sugar for our own markets ; thousands
of cattle and sheep were sent to England. We were exporting thousands of tons of our natural
fertility every year, and importing oats, barley, potatoes, cheese, sugar, and similar things
produced in other States by the aid of our own manures. The inevitable results slowly carried
conviction to even the dullest comprehension. There were always a few voices crying in the
wilderness, and men were led to think what they could do to restore the old fertility of their
farms, their orchards, and their pastures.
The creation of a Department of Agriculture, in 1890, gave a great impetus
to the work of educating the old school of farmers as to the use of fertilisers.
The Agricultural College and Experimental Farms have done much to teach
the young generation, and to teach by precept and example, what can be
done by the judicious use of fertilisers to improve the profits of working

old farms. The well-planned experiments of Professor Lowrie, of Roseworthy College, in


South Australia, demonstrated the value of superphosphate alone —even in small dressings—
to increase the wheat crop, and the result has been a wonderful appreciation in the price of
wheat land in that State. Potash manures were introduced from Germany, no natural supplies
having been yet found in Australia. The bone-ash of the sugar refinery was made into super-
phosphate, and mixed with sulphate of ammonia and potash salts in varying proportions,
to suit the requirements of different crops, as indicated by the agricultural chemist. The
blood and offal of the abattoirs, which had for many years been wasted by being sent out to
the ocean at great expense, are now dried and made into a manure, gladly bought at £6 a ton.
Thousands of tons of bone-dust and superphosphate, formerly sent to New Zealand, to enable
the more advanced farmers there to adopt an
intense form of cultivation, are now gladly used
on our own farms and orchards. The limestone
quarries of the Western district are now turning
out large quantities of agricultural lime, to
sweeten sour soils, and increase the fertility of
many in which that substance is deficient.
The waste lime, hair and scrapings of tanneries,
which used to accumulate in great heaps of
offensiveness, are now eagerly bought by neigh-
bouring gardeners. Wood ashes are not allowed
to go to waste. Their value has been revealed
by the chemist’s analyses, varying from 4s. 3d.
per ton in the case of the ashes of spotted gum,
to 10s. for those of ironbark and box, 255. fid.
for those of red gum, and 31s. 9d. for those of
bloodwood. The advantages of green manur-
ing and of catch crops are being better under-
stood, and cow peas, clovers, tares, field peas,
and lucerne are all used to enrich the soil, by
catching and fixing the nitrogen of the air.
Manure heaps and compost heaps are not yet to
be found on every farm, but they are not such
a curiosity as they were twenty years ago.

for our export trade, very finely ground and dried, is a manure highly appreciated and widely
used, being sold at prices dictated by the chemical analyses, and varying from 90s. to 120 s.


per ton. Gypsum, which is found in large beds in several parts of Australia, is growing in
favour as a constituent of fertilisers for leguminous crops. Nitrate of soda is little used, not
being able to compete in price with the richer sulphate of ammonia, locally made. The interests
of the agriculturist in regard to manures are protected by legislation, and the trade has been
regulated in such a way as to ensure an honest article being procurable at a reasonable price.
The microscopic life in soils, the biological action which influences so much the fertility
of land, the conditions which favour growth and development of bacteria, whether friendly
or hostile,—those that act with the leguminous plants in capturing the riches of the air, or those
that play such a part in fermenting our wines, in maturing our butter, and in ripening our
cheese —all these are becoming known by slow degrees to our young Australian farmers, and
the consequence is a hopeful confidence in the great potentialities of our vast area of arable
land, and the possibilities of agriculture as a calling alike for our own sons, and for the immi-
grants whom we are now inviting to come out and join us in developing and working out the
destinies of this highly favoured land.

THE AGRICULTURAL MAP.
The agricultural map should be studied in conjunction with Chapter XI. The part
coloured green, which practically embraces the whole of the Coast District, with the eastern slopes
of the range of mountains extending throughout the whole of the State, is eminently adapted
for dairying. The northern counties of Rous, Richmond, and Clarence are suited by climate
and rainfall for the sugar-cane, which has been largely cultivated for the past twenty years,
but is gradually giving place to dairying. In the southern districts, maize, millets, sorghums,
oats, rye, potatoes, and other farm crops are raised, and on the soil of second-rate quality in
the undulating country nearer the foothills, considerable attention is given to fruit-growing—
pine-apples, bananas, oranges, lemons, grapes, peaches, apricots, plums, passion-fruit, and
different berries. On the gentle slopes of the central coast and along the Hunter Valley, light
wines of high quality are made. The alluvial soil of all these coastal rivers is well adapted
for the growing of lucerne, maize, and other fodder crops, and the adjoining higher ground
furnishes ideal grazing country for dairy cattle. There are, of course, some stretches of poor
country, even in this highly favoured part of the State, where sandstone and shales give rise
to inferior soils ; but these are generally covered with good timber, and when partially cleared,
yield fair grazing for dry cattle. The greater part of the green area is capable of enormous
expansion in dairying. The rainfall of this district is generally bounteous, varying between
28 inches and 78 inches per annum.
The part coloured red is devoted to general farming, with the grazing of sheep, cattle,
and horses. Occasional small districts, shown by green splashes, are peculiarly suited for
dairying, owing to special climatic conditions ; on the other hand, there are here and there
patches of rough granite country and poor sandstone which are not yet deemed worth attention.
The growing of English fruits, especially cherries, apples, pears, plums, figs, apricots, and berries,
is a profitable industry in many places where the railway makes good markets easily acces-
sible, and there is room to extend orchards an hundredfold, when the demand shall warrant
such extension, • The rainfall of this district varies between 25 inches and 54 inches.

stone fruits, figs, and walnuts can be grown, and the dry summers make it possible to produce
excellent raisins and other dried fruits. Much of this area, more especially the Riverina District,
between the Murrumbidgee and the Murray Rivers, is specially suited for the production of
rich, sweet wines. There are isolated patches of country outside of this area, indicated by
yellow spots, in which wheat has been successfully grown, but, generally speaking, the rainfall
of that part of the State, which is uncoloured, is too low for successful farming under present
conditions. In a few places where the rainfall is below 20 inches, but most of it comes between

have been carried into effect.
The greater portion of the Western Plains, which are uncoloured, is held in extensive
leasehold areas, and is entirely given over to stock-raising, except in the comparatively small
patches of cultivation round the numerous artesian bores in the north-western part, and
along the irrigation canals of the Riverina, in the south-west. The southern limit of the
very extensive water bearing basin pf the western part of the State is indicated by the boundary
line coloured blue. The rainfall of this part of the State varies between 8 inches in the extreme
west and 20 inches on the fringe of the great wheat belt.

CHAPTER XII.
General Agriculture.
Its History and Development—Statistical Record of Progress—Yields—Prospects.
' T is only within recent years that New South Wales has
achieved prominence as an agricultural country. It
kJ IL* ' is but yesterday that the State began to export
wheat—lB97 being the first year that the produc-
tion exceeded the consumption. But the period of
inactivity and agricultural apathy has ended, and
now every year sees a great advance in the area put
under crops of various kinds, and great strides in
productivity. But yet only a beginning has been
made. It has been estimated that within the State there are 20,000,000 acres of land suit-
able in soil and situated in districts possessing all the necessary climatic requirements for
growing wheat; and up to date the total area under this profitable cereal has not touched
the 2,000,000 acres mark. And a similar story could be told with regard to all other agricul-
tural products. With a vast field for expansion, highly favourable natural conditions, and
illimitable markets brought to our very doors by swift modern steamships and low freights,
the future is all to make. New South Wales must, within a very few years, become one of the
greatest agricultural countries in the world. Already her wheat export averages over 9,000,000
bushels a year, and is growing rapidly; while in the British markets in 1904 Australian wheat
had a higher value than that from any other country, being quoted at 31s. 4d. per quarter,
or Is. 3d. per quarter higher than the Argentine grain, 6d, higher than Canadian, and 3s. higher
than British. Usually it is about 2s. per quarter higher than the price of British wheat.
The history of agriculture in New South Wales is a record of a long
continued neglect to take advantage of the bountiful opportunities which
nature has afforded the farmer in this State. Still it is an interesting story,
as all stories are which take us back to those days at the close of the eighteenth
century when a handful of intrepid Englishmen were, 16,000 miles from

home, battling in an unknown and apparently inhospitable country with the greatest colonising
project ever launched.
Australian agriculture had its first start in the endeavours of the first colonists to stave off
starvation. Soon after Captain Phillip’s landing in 1788 he selected the shores of what is now


called Farm Cove for the first Government farm. To-day the site is occupied by, perhaps, the most
beautifully-situated botanical garden in the world. The seeds and trees first planted included
coffee, cocoa, cotton, banana, oranges, guava, tamarine, prickly-pear, eugenia, ipecacuanha,
the fig-tree, bamboo, sugar-cane, vines, quince, apple, pear, strawberry, oak, and myrtle. For
a long time, however, the little settlement was dependent for its food supply on rations brought
from England, and often the colonists were put to sore straits. Failing to obtain any satis-
factory results from the land about Sydney, a Government farm was attempted at a place
which was first called Rose Hill and afterwards Parramatta. But just prior to this—on
25th February, 1790, James Ruse, the first private settler of whom we hear as having attempted
agriculture, had begun farming operations at Parramatta. And it was no doubt the success
of Ruse which induced the Governor to try the land in that neighbourhood. The following
account of this man’s work has been left to us by Captain Tench :—“ I next visited a humble
adventurer who is trying his fortune here. When his term of punishment expired in August,
1789, he claimed his freedom, and was permitted by the Governor, on promising to settle in
the country, to take, in December following, an uncleared piece of ground, with an assurance
that if he would cultivate it, it should not be taken from him. Some assistance was given
him to fell the timber, and accordingly he began. His present account to me was as follows :
‘ I was bred a husbandman, near Launceston, in Cornwall. I cleared my land as well as I
could with the help afforded me. The exact limit of what ground lam to have Ido not yet
know ; but a certain direction has been pointed out to me in which I may proceed as fast as
I can cultivate. I have now an acre and a half in bearded wheat, half an acre in maize, and
a small kitchen garden. On ray wheat land I sowed 3 bushels of seed, the produce of this
country, broadcast. I expect to reap about 12 or 13 bushels. I know nothing of the cultivation
of maize, and cannot, therefore, guess so well of what I am likely to gather.’ ”
It is recorded that
in March, 1791, Ruse
expressed his desire to
relinquish his claim to
any further support from
the Government, declar-
ing that he was able to
provide for himself out
of the produce of his
own farm, which had
been granted to him on
22nd February, 1790.
This was the first land
grant made in Australia.
Ruse afterwards moved

where he obtained another grant. He was one of the first settlers in that district. He died in
1837, and was buried at Campbelltown, where his tombstone is even at the present day in a
well-preserved state.
The success achieved by Ruse caused others to follow his example, and, encouraged by
the active sympathy of the Governor and officials, a free grant of 100 acres being given to
non-commissioned officers of the Marines, and 50 acres to the men who would till the soil.
there was soon a little collection of settlers in the
Hawkesbury district engaged in agriculture. In
1793 Captain John Macarthur took up a farm at
Parramatta, and there laid the foundation of the
pastoral industry. During Governor Macquarie’s
term of office, 1810-21, the Blue Mountains were

crossed by the pastoralist and agriculturist, and from that time the agriculture industry began
steadily to expand. The Australian Agricultural Company was floated in England in 1824;
but this Company devoted its attention mainly to sheep-breeding. The agricultural move-
ment in various parts of the country, however, gradually spread, until in 1860 there were,
including grass-sown lands, 260,798 acres under some form of cultivation.


The area of the State absolutely unfit for cultivation of any sort has been
roughly estimated to be less than 5,000,000 acres. The true farming portion
of the State comprises the whole of the Eastern Division with the exception

of the rugged country in the mountain chains, and most of the Central Division, and it has been
proved by observations extending over a series of years that in this portion there are about
50,000,000 acres where the rainfall is sufficiently plentiful and regular, in eight years out of
ten, for the successful pursuit of agriculture in all its branches. The progress made from 1860
to 1891, the first thirty-one years after the separation of Queensland from New South Wales,
was very slow. In 1860, the area under crops combined with the area in cultivation of any
sort, including grass lands, was, as stated, 260,798 acres, a percentage per inhabitant of 0 7 acres.
The area grew slowly, until, in 1890, there were 852,704 acres under crops and 388,715 under
other forms of cultiva-
lands. By 1894 the

tively rapid growth of the population, it has remained stationary. There is every indication
now that the next few years will see a big spread in agriculture.
In the great increase of area under cultivation that has taken place during
the last ten years, the western slopes account for nearly half the total advance,
or 648,167 acres, and Riverina increased by 351,000 acres. The Central

on the coast very little progress was made, only 12,905 additional acres being brought under
cultivation. The reason of this is that the bulk of the new ground ploughed was put under
wheat, which is not a suitable crop for the rich lands of the coastal areas. The extension of
cultivation has been largely contributed to by the taking up of wheat-growing on large
estates formerly devoted almost exclusively to grazing, and also by the adoption of the
system of farming on shares. During the year 1904 the area cultivated on shares was 340,015
acres, of which nearly one-half —165,993 acres —was in the Riverina Division. Taking the
State as a whole at the end of 1904, of the 198,848,000 acres which comprise its area,


167,408,464 acres were under occupation, 2,672,973 acres under crops, and 607,997 acres
under permanent sown grasses. The proportion of the State under crops to the whole area
was 1-3 per cent., and to the area under occupation 1-6 per cent. Some of the best lands for
producing cereals are in the hands of the pastoralists ; whilst farmers have not always settled
on the kind of country best suited for the cultivation of their crops. This fact tends to
reduce greatly the average annual yield.
By far the largest proportion of the area under crops is devoted to the
cultivation of wheat, which, as is elsewhere pointed out in this volume,
can be produced more cheaply in New South Wales than in any other country
in the world. In 1904 wheat took up 66'5 per cent, of the total cultivation.
Wheat the
biggest Factor.
Hay was responsible for 16’3 per cent.; after which came maize, 7’2 per cent.; green food,
3 3 per cent.; and orchards and market gardens, 2T per cent. In acres the crops ran as
follows Wheat, 1,775,955 acres ; hay, 435,704 acres ; maize, 193,614 acres; green food,
87,718 acres; oats, 40,471 acres; barley, 14,930 acres ; potatoes, 23,855 acres; sugar-cane,
21,525 acres; vines, 8,840 acres; orchards, 47,340 acres; market gardens, 8,827 acres; and
other crops, 14,194 acres. The area devoted to wheat has always exceeded that given to other
crops. From the year 1880, the proportion under wheat has steadily increased, until it now
stands at two-thirds of the whole area under cultivation. During the same time the proportion
under maize has decreased from 20 per cent, to 7 per cent., and hay from 21 to 16 per cent.
The other crops have not varied much, except that the tendency has been for the proportion
to decrease.

The value of the agricultural production is largely dependent upon wheat and hay, the
returns from which in 1904 totalled 63*1 per cent, of the sum realised—£s,4l3,7lo. The maize
crop in the same year was worth £557,000 ; barley, £39,485 ; oats, £67,985 ; potatoes, £251,940 ;
sugar-cane, £180,870; grapes, £54,750; wine and brandy, £76,920; oranges and lemons,

in value since 1881. The fall in prices, especially of wheat, was very rapid down to 1895; for
the next three years there was a very material increase ; in 1899 they fell again to the 1895
level, but in 1901 there was a more or less general increase ; while towards the close of 1902,
and almost up to the close of 1903, the effects of the adverse season were acutely felt, and prices
rose to double those of the previous year. At the end of 1903, when the heavy crops began to
come in, prices again fell, but they were, nevertheless, higher than the 1901 level. In 1904
prices increased slightly, and were generally higher than at the close of 1903.
The advance which New South Wales is now making in wheat culti-
vation is in every way gratifying. It will be seen from a study of the

last thirty years, the annual average yield has been 10-85 bushels to the acre. The highest
averages recorded have been 17-51 in 1903 and 17-37 in 1886. The lowest was 1-24 bushels
in the disastrous year of 1902. During the whole period there were only six seasons when the
yield fell below 10 bushels per acre, namely : 1888 with 475 ; 1895 with 8-71 ; 1898 with
7-03; 1899 with 954 ; 1902 with 1*24 ; and 1904 with 9-27. Five out of the six cases occurred
within the last ten years, which were, perhaps, the driest the State has ever seen. So that
here the story of the wheat yield is heard in its very worst aspect. It can safely be said that


from equal qualities of soil a better yield is now obtained than that realised twenty years ago ;
a result due largely to improved farming, the use of fertilisers, and more economical harvesting
appliances, and to the fact that rust, smut, and other forms of disease in wheat have been less
frequent and less general in recent years. And from the results of wheat-breeding experiments
conducted by the late Mr. Wm. Farrer for the Agricultural Department, it seems likely that
even more freedom from disease and generally better results will be obtained in the future.
The general yield of the State is now adversely affected by the fact that in a great many instances
farmers are cultivating land in unsuitable districts. In favoured localities in good seasons
splendid returns are got; and the general average is by no means a criterion of what the scien-
tific farmer may expect under favourable conditions. Experts state that with the expenditure
of a comparatively small sum on manures and effective machinery and implements, and with
the combination of stock with cultivation, the production from the present area could be increased
by from 50 to 100 per cent. That the possibilities of New South Wales are great must be
admitted, seeing that if only a quarter of the wheat area were cultivated on more scientific lines
there would be a probable surplus of over 50,000,000 bushels available for export after
satisfying all the demands of the local population.
With reference to the cost of growing and exporting wheat, a calcula-
tion recently made shows that taking all factors into account, such as
the proportions of lands variously prepared and sown, the proportion
of crops harvested by different methods, average railway and other freights,

cost per acre of raising a 10-bushel crop may be taken as about 16s. All farmers are interested
in export charges, and taking the wheat from the point of production on a farm 300 miles from

This compares very favourably with the cost of sending wheat from the inland districts of

failure of that year’s crop.
Of the crops other than wheat, maize ranks next in importance. During
the last fifteen years, the area under maize has practically remained at a
standstill, being only 2,000 acres more in 1904 than 1890. The cultivation

of maize is carried on chiefly in the valleys of the coastal rivers, where both soil and climate
are peculiarly adapted for its growth. On the tableland also its cultivation is attended with
good results. In 1904 193,614 acres were cultivated for maize, the total yield of which was
4,951,132 bushels, an average of 25-6 bushels to the acre. The average maize yield over twenty
years ended 1904 was 28-5 bushels. Some of the coastal districts are peculiarly favourable to the
cultivation of maize, and here yields of 80 to 100 bushels per acre are by no means uncommon.
Up to 1890 the State produced more maize than could be locally consumed, and exported a small
quantity to her southern neighbours, but every year since, with one exception, there has been
a net import ranging from 9,883 bushels in 1898 to 1,476,704 bushels in 1903. Practically
nothing has been done to develop an oversea export trade, although maize is apparently growing


ill favour in the United Kingdom and Europe. The great profits to be made from dairying
on the land that is suited for maize-growing has undoubtedly led to the neglect of this cereal,
but the development of pig-raising and bacon-curing as adjuncts to dairying may lead to an
increased demand. The maize crop is a valuable one, and doubtless additional attention will
be paid to it in the future.
Oats is another cereal the cultivation of which has been considerably
neglected in New South Wales. In fact the advance in agriculture to be
noted since 1894 has been almost entirely confined to wheat. There is,

consequently, a great possibility of development along other lines. The deficiency between the
production of oats and the consumption is very considerable. The elevated districts of Monaco,
Argyle, Bathurst, and New England contain large areas of land where the cultivation of oats
could be carried on with remunerative results. Although the cereal is a product of cold climates,
it is cultivated to some extent in Riverina and the South-western Slopes. In 1904 the area
under crop for grain was 40,471 acres, which produced 652,640 bushels, or 16‘1 bushels per
acre. The Northern tableland gave the best average with 20-3 bushels per acre In 1903
1,388,710 bushels of oats were imported, and in 1904 the importations amounted to 192,806
bushels.
Harley is an important crop that, although produced at present in com-
paratively small quantities, will yet come to the front as one of the prominent
features of our agricultural industry. It has been demonstrated that barley,

grown in several parts of the State where the essential conditions of sweet, well-drained soil
exist, is particularly suited for malting, and an effort has been made by brewers during the last
few years to induce a more extensive cultivation in those districts which arc best fitted for the
production of the malting varieties. Farmers are notoriously conservative, and it is well known
that they prefer to jog along on lines familiar to them, producing crops they know all about.
Barley is novel to Australian farmers, and they are disinclined to put it in, disregarding the
profits that await the man who successfully cultivates it. One northern brewer, after vainly

tensive areas on his own account, with the happiest results. During 1904 the area under
barley for grain was 14,930 acres, which yielded 266,781 bushels, or 17'9 per acre. Of the
total area, 11,272 acres were reaped for malting barley, and 3,658 for other varieties. The
K


greater part of the cereal is grown in the Tamworth district, on the North-western Slope,
the area in the district being 11,235 acres, the bulk of which was for malting barley. The
average yield of the barley crops for the last ten years was 15 - 6 bushels per acre. At present
the local demand for barley is largely met by importations from New Zealand. In 1904 the
imports were barley, 123,680 bushels ; malt, 129,647 bushels.

vation for hay is taken up by the area under wheaten hay. Up to 1894 the cultivation of wheat
for hay increased in a much greater ratio than that for grain. During the last eight years,
when the great expansion in wheat cultivation has taken place, there has not been much difference
in the ratio of increase for grain and for hay. Oaten hay is grown in parts of the State where

Wales, so that there is plenty of room for an extension of its cultivation.
Rye and broom millet are minor crops which are as yet little cultivated,
but before which there are excellent prospects. In 1904 3,511 acres were
under rye. The return from the fibre alone of the broom millet crop in 1904
amounted to £29,000, the average return being £l2 18s. per ton. In 1904
the area under broom millet was 3,906 acres, from which 22,493 cwt. of

fibre and 15,916 bushels of grain were obtained, the averages being 5-8 cwt. and 4-1 bushels
respectively per acre. The greater portion of the crop is grown in the Hunter River Valley,
and in the valleys of the northern coastal rivers. Crops of maize, oats, barley, sorghum, millet,
rye, and other cereals, as well as lucerne, rape, and grasses, are grown annually for green food,
and this cultivation is extending owing to the expansion of the dairying industry. Artificial

growth, the cultivation of the potato has progressed very slowly ; and in 1904 73,044 tons
were imported. In that year 10,075 acres were cultivated in New South Wales, chiefly round
Bathurst. The average yield of potatoes for the past ten years was 2*2 tons per acre.
Sugar-cane is grown to a considerable extent in the Northern Rivers districts
where it thrives. Its cultivation is confined chiefly to the valleys of the
Richmond, Clarence, and Tweed Rivers. From a small start on the Hastings
Sugar-cane.
River in 1822, the area under cane has gradually and steadily increased. It reached the highest
point, 32,927 acres, in 1895. After that date great developments in the dairying industry
withdrew land from sugar-planting, and the area under cane steadily declined for five years,
until in 1900 there were only 22,114 acres under cultivation. Since 1900 the area has remained
practically stationary at a little over 20,000 acres. The area of cane cut during 1904 was 9,772


acres, with a total yield of 199.640 tons, or an average of 20 4 tons per acre. During the last
ten years the average was 19*1 tons per acre, and during the last five years 20'6 tons per acre.
Sugar manufacturers invariably purchase the year’s crop of cane standing, and cut it at their
own cost. From plantations in full bearing the average weight of the cane varies from 25 to
32 tons, while the price paid varies from Bs, to 13s. per ton. Until comparatively recent Iv
the field work on the sugar plantations of New South Wales was performed entirely by white
labour, and even in 1901, when the Federal legislation in connection with the sugar industry
was passed, the number of blacks employed was not large. At the census of 1901 there were
239 Hindoos and 291 Pacific Islanders working on the sugar plantations. The duty on imported
sugar is £6 per ton ; while the excise duty is fixed at £3 per ton ; but a bounty of from 4s. to
ss. per ton of cane, calculated according to its sugar contents—equal to £2 per ton of sugar—
is allowed on Australian sugar grown by white labour, the bounty being paid to the grower.
The employment of white against black labour is thus protected to the extent of £2 per ton
of sugar, equal to about 4s. sd. per ton of cane. The cost of growing sugar-cane may be set
down at from 2s. lid. to 3s. sd. per ton of cane according as black or white labour is employed.
About 10 per cent, of the sugar grown is cultivated by black labour.
Throughout the whole of New South Wales, and more especially in
the district between the Lachlan and the Murray, the owners of largo

in the direction of increasing the productiveness of their land, by bringing under iultriation

and to take a farm “ on the shares ” for a year or two will probably in many cases prove the
most profitable course for an immigrant possessed of good agricultural experience but small
capital, who has gained some acquaintance with local conditions in New South Wales, and
wishes to perfect his knowledge of Australian methods of cultivation, and at the same time to


add to the capital at his disposal, with a view to purchasing a farm for himself. To the immigrant
accustomed to the cultivation of grain crops, the large private estates situated in the Hiverina
and other parts of the wheat belt offer opportunities for wheat-farming on shares. The terms

party usually finds the bags needed for his own share of the crop. Often the landlord supplies
all the seed, but not infrequently the tenant is required to provide the same proportion of


the seed as he receives of the harvest. For a man to succeed, or indeed even to make a
commencement at share-farming for wheat, it is, of course, absolutely essential that he should
have at least sufficient capital to buy horses and plant, and to provide a dwelling. In
isolated instances landowners are prepared to assist their tenants by finding implements and
horses for picked men who have first worked with them as labourers to prove their capacity ;
but such cases are quite exceptional.
For dairy-farming on shares, however, nothing is needed but thorough practical experience
in the management of dairy cattle and the general work of a dairy. Large estates have been
thrown open in the coastal districts and elsewhere, notably at Bolaro in the Monaio district,
and on the northern rivers. On these estates the landlord usually provides land, milch cows,
dwelling, cow-bails, piggeries, &c., and the tenant finds all the labour for milking, rearing calves
and pigs, and cultivating sufficient land to provide feed for the winter. The butter is almost
invariably made at one of the many butter factories which exist in every dairying district, and
the milk or cream is carted by the tenant to the factory. As a general rule the tenant receives
from 6s. to 10s. in the £ on the proceeds of all butter and all pigs sold, and also an allowance
for each calf reared.
Anyone who wishes to make a success of share-farming must, of course, be possessed of
a sound practical agricultural training, and no landowner would dream of placing valuable
dairy cattle in the hands of a tenant unless he were thoroughly satisfied of the tenant’s capacity.
But given the requisite experience, industry, and thrift (and, in the case of wheat or mixed
farming, sufficient capital at the outset to provide horses and plant), the share-farmer has every
prospect of making a comfortable living, and of earning enough to establish himself upon a
farm of his own within a reasonable time.
AT WORK AMONG THE VINES.


THE CULTURE OF WHEAT.
This work does not aim in any shape or form at filling the mnctions of an agricultural
text-book ; nor does it propose to instruct technically either the man at present on the land
or the newcomer who may arrive here from distant countries to till our soil. Still, as the
Australian conditions are so different from those of lands in the northern hemisphere, it has
IANDRA WHEAT-FIELD.
been thought wise to incorporate in this chapter a few observations by Mr. McKeown, Manager
of the Wagga Experimental Farm, upon the culture of wheat, the most prominent of the crops.
Mr. McKeown’s remarks, which apply specially to the Riverina, where a considerable proportion
of the State’s wheat is grown, are as follows :
The culture of wheat can be profitably carried out on an immense area
of land in the Riverina district. In most parts the contour of the land
and the texture of the soil are such as to render its production possible at
Wheat-growing.
a low cost in comparison with many other districts. The effects of the dry seasons which
periodically occur may to a considerable extent be mitigated by a thorough preparation of the
land—by the use of fertilisers, and by growers confining their operations to such moderate
areas as will admit of seasonable sowing and harvesting. It is, however, undesirable to
engage in the growth of wheat on a commercial scale in any district in which the rainfall is
liable to be less than 13 inches. An important factor in successful wheat-culture is the system
of fallowing land, which admits of the reception of all the moisture which falls after the land
is broken, and the retention of a larger proportion of it than is possible in unbroken land.
The system next in order of merit is early ploughing of stubble land by means of ploughs of
improved construction. Both of these systems admit of the early sowing of the seed, which
is necessary to secure the best results, as early sown seed stools or tillers much more extensively
than that which may be classed as late sown. A fruitful cause of depreciated profit on


wheat-culture has been the attempts of many growers to cultivate too large an area. The
results have been —imperfectly prepared land, delayed sowing, and even when under the most
favourable natural conditions fair crops have been raised, the inability of the grower to
harvest his crop because of the excessive extent of his land.
During the six years from 1899 to 1904 the average annual rainfall at the Wagga Experi-
mental Farm was 17-66 inches, while that of the growing period of the crops from Ist May to
15th November was 11 -4 inches. The highest average yield of any variety of wheat sown
during that period was obtained from Farmer’s Friend, which returned 21 bushels 12 lb. per
acre, with Hudson’s Early Purple Straw next with 20 bushels 4 lb. ; several other varieties
following in close order. Several new varieties cultivated during the last three yeais ha\»
given good results—Federation being first with a little over 22 bushels per acre. The land
was treated with fertilisers at a moderate cost, and the results have been very profitable.
Experience in a variety of seasons has furnished ample proof that it will
pay wheat-growers to thoroughly prepare the land for sowing, and it is
recommended that all soils of fair depth should be ploughed to a depth of
Preparation.
6 inches where practicable. This cannot be accomplished under all conditions experienced
here, as much of the Riverina soil sets very hard in dry weather, and is then difficult to handle.
The use of rotary disc ploughs has largely improved these conditions, as with them it
is possible to start ploughing much earlier after the removal of a crop, or when weather conditions
are unfavourable. In all seasons we have been able to commence work in January, and in a
large proportion of our land it has been possible to perform excellent work in deeply ploughing
and pulverising the soil. In addition to their being excellent dry-weather implements, their
work is very economical, as we have ploughed up to 5 acres in eight hours with one plough
drawn by five horses. The cost of discs is moderate, an expenditure of £3 10s. per year covering
the wear and tear under this heading for, say, 500 acres. The cost of repairs is light, one of our
ploughs having recently required some new parts for the first time after nearly six years’ use.
The pulverisation of the soil to as great a depth as possible is of very great importance ;
therefore the value of these implements cannot
be overrated. The system of shallow ploughing
is to be condemned ; and if farmers would pre-
pare areas side by side ploughed deep and shal-
low respectively, they would soon become con-
vinced that for the extra cost of breaking their
land 6 inches instead of 3 inches deep, the
increased crops would amply repay them.
It is sometimes urged that, as wheat is a
surface-feeding plant, shallow ploughing is all
that is necessary. A forest tree may exist in
the soil contained in a 6-inch pot, but it cannot


attain its full development; and wheat compelled to find nourishment in the upper 3 inches
of the soil naturally cannot find as much food and moisture in that space as in G or 7 inches
of free soil. Besides this, it is often found that when the first 6 inches of the soil is broken,
that next below is sufficiently free to admit readily the roots of the plants in search of nourish-
ment at a greater depth.
In soil which is liable to crust on the surface, it is desirable, where rolling
is necessary, to carry out the work before the seed is sown, and not to roll
afterwards till the crop is fairly well grown, and then to follow with light
harrows drawn across the drill furrows. Soils vary so greatly that it is not

our conditions we have usually found it best to leave the land with the slight furrows formed
by the drills, as an even surface is very liable to crust and cause the rainfall to run off.
The harrowing of growing crops may be carried out until the crops are about G inches
high, provided the soil is firm enough to keep the harrows from penetrating deeply, but it should
not be done before the plants are well rooted.
The importance of seed selection is again impressed upon those who are
about to sow ; therefore, where individual farmers cannot afford a grader of
the best kind, it is suggested that such implements be obtained and worked
by groups of grain-growers for their mutual benefit.
Seed
Selection.
Good implements, however, are obtainable at moderate prices ; and as considerably
increased yields may be obtained by using only the best grade of seed, the cost of a machine
would soon be recouped.
Some years ago tests of varying grades of seed sown by hand were carried out on a small
scale on this farm, and the results were always in favour of the best qualities. Last season
these tests were commenced on a larger scale as field crops, when No. I grade seed yielded
bushels more per acre than the second and third grades sown together.


The advantage of drilling over broadcasting seed has been frequently
advocated and demonstrated, as will be seen by the accompanying statement
of returns. The increased yield, together with the saving in cost of seed,
will more than cover the cost of a drill on the first 150 acres. The yields

from varying quantities of seed are also shown, and they amply demonstrate the desirability
of sowing only moderate quantities of seed, as although sowings of 60 lb. per acre show a larger
total return, the average gain from the extra 20 lb. of seed is only at the rate of 4 lb. per acre.
For general field work we set our drills to sow half a bushel; and as grain varies in size
according to variety, our average sowing will work out at about 33 lb. per acre. Half a bushel
per acre under our conditions we regard as the minimum quantity to be sown.

As a preventive of smut and bunt, we treat the seed with a 2 per cent.
(1 lb. to 5 gallons) solution of sulphate of copper, immersing the seed for not
more than five minutes. Should the seed, however, not be well filled, the
dipping should accordingly be of less duration. Some varieties are more

liable to the attacks of bunt than others, and in such cases it has been found necessary to increase
the quantity of bluestone to 3 per cent. (1 lb. to gallons). Ten gallons of solution should
treat about 10 bushels of seed.


The best time for sowing is from the middle of April to the end of May ;
but, when circumstances require it, a week in June may not be too late.
A good deal of sowing is carried out in Riverina before April ; but in our

portion of the district crops sown so early, no matter what the variety of wheat, have a
tendency to produce too much straw in good seasons.
Should insufficient rain fall in March or April, there is considerable risk of loss of seed,
or at the least of a severe check to seed which may have obtained a start.
These risks, however, are greatly de-
creased by fallowing the land from winter or
spring in the preceding year, as land so pre-
pared is in a better condition to receive and
retain such moisture as may fall between the
ploughing and sowing seasons. As it is seldom
that late sown seed returns anything like the
crops harvested from seasonably sown areas,
it will pay better to fallow such land as can-
not be sown by the first week in June.
It has been further noted that a curtailment of the areas sown should place many growers
in a position to carry out their harvesting more seasonably, thus benefiting themselves individ-
ually, in addition to increasing our district average, as much grain is lost by delayed harvesting.
The raising of wheaten hay for home consumption in ordinary seasons,
for fodder reserves against drought seasons, or for sale in the city markets,
is worthy of greater attention than is usually given to it. Under our con-
ditions a crop of wheaten hay may be counted on with much more certainty

than is the case with oats, which requires much more moisture to bring it to perfection. It
is, however, possible to secure payable crops of oaten hay when good varieties are sown early
in the autumn.
The figures at foot show the crops of wheaten hay harvested at the Experimental Farm
during the last five years. The method of preparing the land has been the same as that applied
to land used for the production of grain.
The most successful fertiliser has been superphosphate containing a percentage of nitrogen
and potash, the quantity used being 70 lb., costing 4s. (id., per acre. In all cases the seed
and manure have been sown with the drill, the quantity of seed used being 45 lb. per acre,
first quality grain. March and April will be found the best months for sowing.
White straw wheats are far preferable to the purple straw varieties for haymaking, as
the weight is much greater, the straw has far less “ dead Hag,” and the hay is better liked by
stock of all kinds. In selecting varieties care should be taken to choose those which carry a
green colour to the lowest possible point on the straw. The varieties which have proved the
best with us are Zealand or Berthoud, White Essex, Australian Talavera, and White Lammas,

N various parts of the State experimental farms have
been established by the Government for the purpose

|[l grow in the particular districts in which these farms
are situated ; and also to demonstrate how best to
produce crops in the most suitable and economic

to adopt is being worked out on the several farms, and experiments are being carried out
with cattle and sheep, in view of their value in connection with rotations. Important trials
in the crossing of various breeds of sheep are being made to determine, if possible, the best
cross for the use of farmers and the production of lambs for home and export markets.
In view of the remarkable increase and prospective growth of the Dairying industry
several breeds of dairy cattle of the best procurable strains have been imported from Europe,
with a view to general improvement in dairy stock. A stud farm has been established where
cattle are bred for distribution by sale, or by the leasing out of bulls at reasonable charges, and
there is no doubt that this work by the Agricultural Department has already had a marked
effect on some of the dairy herds.
An Agricultural College at Richmond, named the Hawkesbury Agricul-
tural College, was established some years ago for the instruction of young
men in practical and scientific Agriculture. So greatly has the demand for
instruction in agriculture increased that it has been found necessary to

from Sydney, and is easily accessible by train from Redfern Railway Station. The farm in con-
nection with the College comprises an area of 3,500 acres of land, 1,000 acres of which is under
cultivation. One hundred and eighteen acres of land in addition to this have recently been
acquired by lease on the bank of the Hawkesbury River. This land on the river is extremely
fertile, capable of being irrigated, and, consequently, of much value in the education of the
students.
The farm equipment is ample and of the most modern type, and students have every
opportunity of making themselves proficient in various branches of agriculture and horticul-
ture. The dairy is well stocked with suitable breeds of dairy cattle and pigs. The orchard
gives an opportunity of acquiring a thorough knowledge of all branches of orchard work, the
drying and canning of fruits, the making of preserves, of tree planting, pruning, grafting,
budding, as well as the application of farmyard manure, artificial manures, and of green
manuring. Instruction is also given in various branches of gardening. Full instruction is
afforded in poultry-rearing, and also in bee-keeping.
Instruction is given in carpentry, building, in blacksmithing, and also in engine-driving,
and in the use of electricity. In the class rooms instruction in chemistry, botany, bac-
teriology and their practical application, veterinary science, wool-sorting, the use of the
microscope, book-keeping, &c., &c., is given. The course extends over two years, or four
sessions, and each candidate must be over the age of 16 years.


Each resident student is required to provide himself with the following articles : —Two
suits working clothes, one suit for Sunday wear, two pairs suitable boots and one pair slippers,
hair brush and comb, one clothes-brush, four sheets, three pillow-slips, six strong bath towels,
two large aprons for the chemical laboratory, set of mosquito nets. All wearing apparel, bed
linen, &c., must be distinctly marked with the name of the student, otherwise it will not be
taken to the laundry.
The academic year is divided into two sessions :—The first session commences 23rd
January, and ends. 22nd June, and the second on 23rd July, ending 22nd December.
Students are admitted, for practical work only, at the Wagga Wagga Experimental Farm,
Bathurst Experimental Farm, Wollongbar Experimental Farm, and at the Stud Farm, Berry.
The main objects of the Wagga Farm are to make experiments with wheats,
and other cereals, various kinds of fruits, and the keeping of sheep,
horses, and cattle, and to carry out exact scientific experiments, with

manures, the breeding or making of wheats, &c., and much valuable work has been done.
Another important work carried out here is the demonstrating of the most economic and
effective systems of harvesting crops.
The experiments with fruit-trees and grape-vines have been considerable. Hundreds
of various kinds of fruits have been tested as to their suitability for soil and climate. These
experiments have proved the value of grapes and prunes for drying purposes, and several
varieties are now grown here to demonstrate their value from a commercial point of view.
The experiments made with the production of a cross-bred sheep for the use of farmers have
proved highly successful and profitable. A herd of dairy cattle, and a considerable number
of pigs, pure strains of poultry and turkeys are kept, and also a Suffolk punch stallion for breed-
ing purposes.
Within a short distance of the city of Bathurst is situated the Experimental
Farm, which contains about 700 acres of land. Here numerous important
experiments are carried on with

cereals,fodders, fruit-trees, sheep, and cattle; rotations
of crops, and so on. This farm has excited considerable
attention in consequence of the demonstrations given
of the great increase of its crops over all other crops
grown in the district, and also the magnificent fruit
produced in the orchard, which comprises an area of 40
acres. In connection with this farm, but distant about
2 miles, there is an area of land of about 20 acres on

CHAPTER XIV.
Timber Industry.
Timber Industry- State Control of Forestry—Building Materials—Cost of Erecting
Home, Farm Buildings, and Fencing.
BY R. DALRYMPLE-HAY,
CHIEF FORESTER.
TO intending settlers the question of timber supply is almost as
important as that of water. The man about to settle on
the land will naturally, among other questions, ask for in-
formation on this point, and, as far as the State as a whole
is concerned, he can be most readily answered by quoting
from a recent official report on Forestry (1902), which in
regard to timber resources reads as follows :
“ Although not well distributed the State’s timber re-
sources arc large, particularly in the coastal or eastern
portion. Of ordinary hardwoods there is an extensive supply
available, and a large margin for export. In localities not
immediately accessible the forests of this timber are practi-
cally virgin. The timber resources of the highland zone, although not varied, are large,
there being sufficient supply to meet present and future requirements.
“ Inland the supply in proportion to the area of territory is limited—in parts it is unequal
to the demands of settlement; in this part of the State, timbers of commercial value are,
generally speaking, confined to the timber reservations.”
From this it will be seen that in the North and South Coast Districts, as well as in the
Northern and Southern Tablelands, there need be no anxiety about ample supplies of timber,
but on the western slopes the climatic conditions are not so favourable to forest growth, and,
therefore, the supply of timber is limited. It
would not do, however, to infer that timber in
the west is not obtainable, but it would be as
well for the intending settler to bear in mind
that in that part of the State it is less plentiful
than elsewhere, and, therefore, the cost is re-
latively higher than on the coast or tableland.

NEW SOUTH WALES— THE MOTHER STATE


An Industry
of some
Proportions.
The timber industry of New South Wales is one of some proportions, and
the demand for sawn timber is supplied by the working of 324 saw mills
in various parts of the State. Quite 60 per cent, of these are located in
the coastal districts, but the distribution of the remainder is sufficiently wide
to assure the possibility of obtaining sawn timber for building purposes
in every part of the State where the conditions are suitable for settlement.
The following is a brief description of the principal timbers to be obtained
in each of the five climatic districts. The North Coast stretches from the
Hawkesbury River north to the Queensland border, and inland to the margin
of the tableland. Throughout this tract, which is the best timbered in the
Location of
Timbers.
State, a great variety of hardwood timbers, suitable for building and constructive purposes,
is obtainable, and in the brushes, which principally occur on the higher lands north of the Manning
River, brush or softwoods are abundant. The hardwoods comprise ironbark, tallow-wood,
blackbutt, Sydney blue gum, spotted gum, grey gum, red and white mahogany, turpentine,
and brush box. The principal softer brush woods are red cedar, rosewood, black and red bean,
onion wood, white beech, silky oak, coachwood, tulipwood, Colonial pine, and native teak.
In the South Coast, extending from the Great Western Railway Line south to the Vic-
torian border, and inland to the Main Dividing Range, are principally hardwoods, comprising
ironbark, blackbutt, spotted gum, stringybark, grey box, forest red gum, Sydney blue gum,
woollybutt. bloodwood, and turpentine.
The Northern Tableland, embracing the highlands north from the Great Western Rail-
way Line to the Queensland border, contains principally hardwoods comprising stringybark,
blackbutt, ironbark, yellow box, grey box, and forest red gum.
The Southern Tableland, the highlands south from the Great Western Railway Line to
the Victorian border, is timbered chiefly with hardwoods, comprising stringybarks, mountain
ash, messmate, white and yellow box, and mountain gum.
The Western Slopes extend from the western margin of the tableland to within 100 miles
of the Darling River, The principal timber of this tract is cypress pine; but other timbers such
as ironbark, grey box, yellow box, and Murray red gum occur in different parts. Cypress pine
is widely distributed over the whole of the Western
Slopes, but is by no means plentiful, a large extent
of this tract being treeless country. Box usually
grows with cypress pine, and frequently ironbark is
found also. Ironbark occurs principally to the north
of the Great Western Railway Line, and Murray red
gum is confined to the river systems, its principal
locality being between the Murray and Murrum-
bidgee.


Forestry in New South Wales is under State control, and of the total
estimated area of 20,000,000 acres of timbered land, 7,500,000 acres have
been reserved and set apart for the conservation of the timber supply. The

forest laws are embodied code of regulations, under which all workers in Crown forests
are required to register or license themselves.
In addition to the license fee, a royalty at the
rate of 7d, per 100 superficial feet on ironbark,
5d. on other hardwoods, 6d. on brush or soft-
woods, 9d. on cypress pine, and Is. 6d. on red
cedar and Murray red gum is charged on the
quantity of timber obtained under the license.
In addition to other matters, the regulations
provide the minimum girths at which frees may
be felled. The forest laws do not apply in the
case of lands taken up for settlement purposes,
and under both freehold and leasehold tenures
the settler is entitled to the free use of whatever timber is on the land allotted to him. One of
the leading characteristics of the Australian forests is rapidity of growth and abundant natural
reproduction.
The hardwoods of New South Wales have achieved a world-wide reputa-
tion, and it is universally 7 admitted that for street-paving they have no
superior. A considerable export trade, and one which is capable of great
expansion, is already done in these timbers, although comparatively 7 little
has been effected in the way of making their virtues known to the world.
Hardwoods

Superior.
Railway sleepers of the highest grade are also cut from New South Males hardwoods, vhile
New South Wales turpentine piles for wharves or piers have been found to be in such sound
condition on being drawn after thirty years service in the water, that they have been used
again in new structures. New South Wales hardwoods are remarkable for the great size of
the beams which may be obtained from them, as well as for the strength and durability of
their wood. Ironbark girders for building have not only the advantage of great size and
strength, but they are in addition almost fire-proof. Their use in a building is an almost
certain assurance that no matter how fierce the fire which rages the exterior walls will remain
standing, instead of collapsing as they invariably do when stayed by steel girders, which,
when hot, crumple under the application of water.
It is not alone, however, in her hardwoods that New South W ales is entitled to notice
on account of her timbers. The softwoods in the brush forests of the coastal region rival those
of any other part of the world. Some of the least known of these trees have wood grained
and marked most beautifully, which is susceptible of the highest polish. These woods are
adapted to the finest description of cabinet-making.


The Settler's
House.
In building homes on the land, the class of material used is largely regulated
by situation. In well-timbered country the settler usually commences by
erecting what is called a slab hut, the framing of which is constructed of
sapling timber, the sides of slabs split from larger trees, and the roof of
bark. This is necessarily a rough form of building, it is seldom floored, and, as a rule,
it is in course of time replaced by a more pretentious building erected in the fore-
ground, and the original building is converted to kitchen or other uses. Some settlers with
ideas of greater comfort and a little capital to spare, start with a better class of building,
constructed of sawn timber with galvanized-iron roofing, and floored, lined, and partitioned
with sawn timber. The form of this building is invariably a cottage on wood block foundations,
with a verandah in front and a skillion at back. Sometimes, where cost is a consideration,
interior lining of the walls is omitted, and the partitions are oidy lined on one side. As a preven-
tive to the intrusion of white ant, the wood block foundations are capped with zinc. Apart

dependent upon situation. If a supply of timber is
available on the land, the cost of homes, farm build-
ings, and outhouses of slabs and sapling timber, with
bark roofing, is merely that of the labour involved,
together with a nominal cost for nails and fittings.
To arrive at an estimate of cost for the better class
of building, a type must be taken, and that shown

The quantity of material required for the erection of a building of this type, including
labour, would cost the amounts shown in the following table, but if the settler can undertake
to build his own home, the cost of labour, about 15 per cent., may be deducted.

varies with the purpose for which it is to he used. For agricultural plots post and wire fencing
is, perhaps, the commonest form, and where it is necessary to exclude rabbits and other vermin
the fence is wire-netted about 3 feet from the ground. For a cattle fence, such as would be
required for enclosing a dairy farm, post and barbed wire is frequently used, but the more
substantial post and two-rail fence is preferred if suitable timber is available. A sheep fence
is usually post and six wires. The posts in such a fence are sometimes spread to 12 feet apart,
and the wires are stapled midway on spreaders or battens. Amongst other types of fencing
erected by settlers for different purposes are posts, top rail, and four to six wires; posts, two
rails, and two to four wires ; cockatoo fencing ; and chock and log fencing. In all fences of the
post and rail class the material used, if split from matured trees, makes a more durable and
lasting fence than one erected from round or sapling timber.
The following types of fencing are common to the different divisions of the State, and
can be erected for approximately the prices quoted, which include both labour and material :

CHAPTER XV.
Cost of Stocking and Working a Farm
Australian and British Methods Compared.
01 N the subject of the cost of stocking and working a farm,
J contributions are made by Messrs. R. W. Peacock,
C. H. Gorman, and G. M. McKeown, Managers of
State Experimental Farms at Bathurst, Wollongbar,
and Wagga, respectively, centres widely separated in
point of distance, climate, and conditions.
Mr. Peacock gives the following estimate : —The cost of stocking and working a farm
is based upon the assumption that the farm is of an area of 300 acres, 100 of which is devoted
to arable farming, and the balance to grazing, and situated in a district suitable for mixed
farming.

The estimate of the live stock required is based upon the assumption that crops are to
be grown for the stock to supplement the natural pastures ; without such practice the land
would need to be beyond the average, or the number of stock reduced. The class of stock
carried could be varied at the discretion of the farmer.
The estimate for machinery and tools is for those which are practically indispensable.
A reaper and binder may advantageously be purchased for the use of two farmers, as one machine
can very well deal with an area of 200 to 250 acres of cereals during one season. It might
also be possible to get such work contracted for, thus saving the expenditure when only small
areas are under crops necessitating its use.
The labour necessary upon a farm of the above capacity could be performed by the
proprietor and a lad employed permanently, with a hired man for about eight weeks during the
harvest or busiest portion of the year. The wages required for the lad would be from ss. to 10s.
per week and his
keep. For the
hired man 20s. to
30s. per week and
keep. The cost of
keep upon the
farm would be
from 6s. to 7s.
per week.

Mr. Gorman of the

mental Farm, deals

Stock.
farm as follows :—The following par-
ticulars will cover the cost of stocking
a dairy farm in the North Coast dairy-
ing districts, watered by the Clarence,
Richmond, and Tweed Rivers. Pre-
suming that suitable land has been
secured for the purpose of dairying, the
most important point to bear in mind is suitable cattle, and, although at the outset it might be
thought that cheap cattle are quite good enough to make a start with, intending dairy farmers
will find it to their advantage to secure something likely to show a return in progeny. Nothing
is more important than to secure a good class of dairy beast, and these can be secured after
careful inspection. If milk and butter is what is required, the cross-bred cow will be the most
profitable, but by selecting a pure breed, stud breeding can be combined with the production
of butter. This course, however, is recommended to those who have had a long experience
in breeding rather than beginners, and in many cases one is sacrificed to the other.
It must be borne in mind that dairy cows are breeding continuously, and much thought
should be given to the progeny. Are they as good as the dams ? If not, something is wrong,
and a cause must be looked for. Is it in the sire in use ? I wish to emphasise the necessity of
having a thoroughly good sire at the head of the herd. In dairying, unless a good sire is in use,
the herd will be going back rather than forward; therefore, in selecting a sire for your dairy
herd, get the very best available, and a pure sire at that. I consider that the sire is the most
important item in the dairy herd ; and if a farmer can afford to give good prices for cows, he
must be able to afford a good price for a sire. It would be better to have fewer cows and a
good sire than to obtain a lot of cows and a poor sire. It may not be noticed at first, but when
the progeny begin to come in, regrets will soon be expressed at the look of them, and later on
at the result of them. Therefore, in thinking of stocking a dairy farm, first of all select a first
class bull of known milking strain. It is not intended to suggest the particular breed to go
in for, because each of the dairy breeds have their own virtue for their own district. The
following breeds do well in the North Coast, viz.:—Jersey, Guernsey, Ayrshire, and Milking
Shorthorn. The latter is now almost considered an Australian breed, and as such traces its
origin to the South Coast of the State. Breeds such as the Holstein and Red Poll are suitable
where it is intended to go for raising steers as well as dairying. A dairy bull of good strain
can be purchased for from £l5 to £35, and it will pay well to start as I have suggested with a
good sire for the herd. Milking cows can be purchased for from £6 10s. to £l5 ; springing
heifers, from £5 to £10; backward heifers, from £4 to £6 ; young calves from £2 to £4.


In conjunction with dairying, pig fattening will always be carried on, and for this purpose
cross-bred brood sows are most profitable, with a pure-bred hog of whatever breed is desired.
Good brood sows can be obtained for from 255. to £2, and pure bred hogs from £2 2s. to £7 7s.
Draught horses, suitable for all round farm work, can be bought for from £l9 to £3O,
light horses from £9 to £2O.
Those desirous of going in for a few sheep can obtain suitable rams (pure) from £2 2s. to
£7 75., and cross-bred breeding ewes for from 255. to 375. 6d. This of course will be an adjunct
to dairying.
Farm hands are usually paid from 10s. to 30s. per week and found, and for that wage
they are expected to do any work on the farm. Good milkers are worth 20s. per week, and can
LOADING WOOL AT SHED.
get this, but they must be expert at the work. By day labour, 6s. per day is given. In working
dairy farms, many owners work their farms with families —that is to say, all members of the
family are called upon to do their share of the work. Wages in this case range from £8 to £l6
per month, with house found, and the right to supply of milk and vegetables. This is, to my
mind, a better method of working a farm than on the share system, as there is less risk of care-
lessness. The share system referred to is a plan of giving those working the dairy a percentage
or allowing half the proceeds monthly, and paying an agreed amount, up to 10s. per head, for
all the calves reared. All work is done by the family, such as milking, feeding calves, separating,
feeding pigs, ploughing, sowing, harvesting, fencing, building, repairs, and any work of the
nature of farm labour.

To stock a dairy farm of 100 acres, I should estimate the detailed cost of what I consider
necessary to make a good start, exclusive of a bull, as follows :
Including the bull, the cost might roughly be put down at £4OO.

Even if the farmer harvest with a stripper, a reaper and binder will be necessary for
haymaking. The plant, in the event of a stripper being preferred, would be increased by £5-4
for a stripper and £35 for a winnower.
In some districts threshing machines
are available to complete by contract
the work of the reaper and binder, at
prices ranging from 12s, to 255. per 100

operations, thus making it possible to reduce the outlay when starting operations, if so desired.
• Not absolutely necessary at start.


The capacity of some of the implements is, of course, greater than the area quoted.
The work of preparing land in the sowing season is relieved considerably by fallowing land in
the winter or early spring between the sowing and harvesting seasons. For this work, however,
a mouldboard plough is necessary, the price of a double furrow implement being about £l6
and that of a four-furrow about £26. In this case a scarifier, costing about £l2, is desirable
for preparing the fallowed land in the autumn. For ploughing dry stubble land the disc
plough is the best implement, and it may also be used finally to prepare the fallow. Its work
is more economical than that of the mouldboards.

The cost of procuring livestock will naturally vary with the resources and requirements
of the settler. Horses, which are included in the working plant, are at present high in price,
the quotations not being the highest ruling rates.

The cost of dairy utensils and plant will naturally vary with conditions, as a couple of
pounds will cover the cost of requirements for supplying the home only.
For the shearing of a small flock of sheep, temporary arrangements may be made by
using a shed or outhouse forming part of the farm buildings.
Mr. Peacock discusses the difference between English and Australian
conditions. He says :—The Australian system of farming differs from the
English system in not being so intense. The Australian has operated up to
the present with practically unlimited areas of virgin soil, and the necessity
for intensive and scientific culture naturally has, therefore, not been forced

upon him to the same extent as upon the British farmer. The British practice, with modifi-
cations, could he successfully followed in Australia, and upon many areas, contiguous to
market and large centres of population, it is the only system by which the land can be put to
its best use.
Instead of it being necessary to make provision for a long cold winter as in England,
the dry summers of Australia demand that provision be made for them. Generally speaking,
stock can be carried through the ordinary Australian winter without artificial feeding, and
very little attention. The dry seasons which sometimes occur demand that the stock-owner
make provision if he wishes to save his Hocks.
The farmer has not to struggle with an excess of moisture as is often the case in England,
but must contrive by all means in his power to conserve in the soil the water given him in the
rainfall by thorough and frequent cultivations. Bare fallow in England may be attended by
a serious loss of plant food by leaching. In Australia it is attended by excellent results, owing
to the retention of soil moisture. Many crops which under English conditions are used exten-
sively in farm practice do not succeed as well under Australian methods, and others more
suitable must be grown in their place to fit in with the same principles underlying successful
agriculture.

CHAPTER XVI.
Dairying.
Possibilities of the Export Trade-Causes of Increased Consumption—Competitors
of the State Results—Room for Development.
BY M. A. O’CALLAGHAN,
CHIEF DAIRY EXPERT, DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
B* \ A IRVING, as one of the national industries of Australia,
might be said to have begun with the export of
dairy produce to England. Hitherto the dairy farmer
JtM was the butt of local conditions. In a good season,
butter was plentiful, and 4d. per lb. was considered
an average price in spring and summer. This was
in the seventies; but soon after, science came to
the aid of the dairy farmer with the centrifugal
separator and the refrigerator, thereby changing the
entire aspect of dairying, not alone in Australia, but in all other civilised countries.
To-day, dairying—that is, the production of milk for various purposes—stands out as
the greatest industry connected with the soil throughoutthe world. If a man were asked casually
to name the greatest productive rural industry in the world, he would probably reply wheat-
growing, knowing that bread forms an important portion of the daily ration of both the rich
and the poor. Let us analyse the subject a little. In 1903, Coghlan estimated the world’s
wheat production at 389,350,000 quarters. The average price (Coghlan) per quarter in London
that year was 265. 9d. This gives a total money value of £520,755,625. Huge figures, but
huger still are those of the dairying industry. Including Europe, America, Australasia, and
Africa, the total value of the milk raised from dairy cows I estimate as having been not less
than £524,500,000 in 1903. This leaves out Asia. Reliable statistics of values or quantities
from Asiatic sources are not procurable ; but we know that India recorded 20,822,834 cows
in 1903, apart from buffaloes, and Siberia, a country of great promise, was stated to possess
4,946,800 cattle. Then, of course, milk and butter (of a kind) are used and produced throughout
all other parts of Asia, even in Thibet. The Asiatic figures, if available, would, therefore,
swell the bill very considerably ; but it is, as given, sufficiently large to demonstrate the impor-
tance of the dairying industry to the world as a whole.

From 1871 to 1875, the average was £11,420,650. From 1876 to 1880, the figures were
£14,921,494, and from 1881 to 1885, the average was £16,410,864. From 1886 on, the figures
are given in detail in the following table :
Prior to 1886 the margarine figures were not separated from the butter returns, and
hence only combined figures are available for the earlier periods. It is seen that since 1887
the imports of butter have shown a steady annual increase, with the exception of the year
1898, which, though of greater money value, was in actual quantity less than 1897 ; and the
total imports of dairy produce have grown from about £7,000,000, in 1864, to £31,000,000
sterling in 1904.
The British imports of dairy products, as given, act, to a great extent, as an indicator
of the world’s progress in dairying. As the value of British imports increased, so the productive
energy and enterprise of other countries grew, until a stage was reached when every commercial

nation strove for supremacy on the British butter markets. Later on some of these competitors,
owing to many causes, had to turn their attention to the supply of butter for their own people,
thus making room for new countries like Australia, the Argentina, and Siberia. The story of
this development and change is, however, best told by the following figures :
Amounts supplied to the United Kingdom, in cwt., in the following years; —
Other countries that have sent butter to England, but only in small quantities, are :
Austria-Hungary, none since 19(H); Brazil, none since 1900 ; Egypt, Iceland, and Greenland,
a growing amount; Italy, none since 1902 ; Spain, very small and irregular lobs ; Uruguay,
563 cwt. in 1903 ; British East Indies, 1,417 cwt. in 1904 ; and a few other places in trifling lots.
A NORTH COAST DAIRY FARM.


Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Argentina, and Russia (including Siberia)
are all on the up grade, and are capable of immense expansion. Denmark
has increased to an extraordinary extent, but there is evidence that it has
practically reached its limit. The years 1902, 1903, and 1904 show the

these that suggest a probable limit
to development.
Germany, Italy, and the
United States of America are all on
the down grade, so far as exports
to Great Britain are concerned.
France is practically at a standstill,
with the tendency downwards;
Holland and Belgium, Norway and
Sweden are in the same position as
France, and we might add JDen-
mark. This is the export history to England, but this need not necessarily be any indicator
to the history of production in the countries named, as the world s consumption of butter and
milk has enormously increased during recent years.
Increase in the world’s wealth ; increase in the world’s population ; decrease
in the average price of butter, causing a greater consumption per head ; the

proved dairy hygiene; and a better control of the sale of butter substitutes, such as margarine.
Let us review these causes a little in detail;—
Increase in the world’s wealth, and in population ; These two might be grouped together.
Countries like England, U.S.A., and Germany are daily growing in wealth and in popu-
lation, especially in the population of their cities. Unlike bread, butter is more or less a
luxury, and as a country increases in wealth there will be an increased consumption ot buttei,
although the bread bill may not alter: this is one of the reasons why dairying should go on
increasing as the world becomes gradually richer. Compare the wealth of the United States
to-day with what it was twenty years ago. Millions of people living there, the descendants
of immigrants, eat butter daily, who, had they been born and continued to live in overcrowded
Europe, would have to be content with unbuttered bread. As the wealth and population of
this great country goes on increasing, there is every probability that, instead of exporting
dairy products to England, she will consume all she makes, and perhaps also provide a market
for some Canadian butter and cheese.


Of all the countries mentioned, Germany presents the most interesting
features. Twenty years ago she was a heavy exporter of butter to England.
Now the excess of butter imports over exports amounts to about 30,000 tons,

equal to over £3,000,000 per year. This great change is due mainly to the fact that Germany
has largely increased the wealth and population of her big towns. This means a greater
attraction for the people to the cities, with a corresponding decrease in those left to carry
on rural industries, resulting in higher wages to the agricultural labourer, and decreased profits
on dairying. The increase in wealth also means an increased consumption of butter per head,
due to the improved position of the people. These two items cause Germany to require all
her dairy products for her own people, and instead of being a competitor of ours on the British
markets there is every probability that she will at a future date be a large importer of
Australian butter.
When science perfected refrigerating methods Australia’s opportunity came,
and from a small beginning by New South Wales in 1888, and by Victoria
in 1890, the export trade of the Commonwealth has grown until now it has
become a factor to be reckoned with, and almost every English house of note
in the butter trade is beginning to realise that the Australian business is

worth coming from London to inquire into. Australia is now well known on the chief British
markets for dairy produce. The competition on these markets has become keener and keener,
however, and the producing world stands to-day with the eyes of its intelligence officers centred
on the movements of what might be considered the mouth of the world’s greatest provision
depOt, viz., London. In 1901 the butter imported into England from outside the British Isles
was valued at £21,117,162, With such a prize as this up for competition it is apparent that
strenuous efforts will be made by all butter-producing countries to capture a section of it.
At present Denmark is easily first in the
competition, having obtained £9,003,089
in 1904 for the butter it sent to England.
Yet in 1886 the total value of the butter
imported into England was but £8,141,438,
or nearly a million less than what little
Denmark sent last year. Ten years ago,
in 1896, the figures were £15,344,364.
That year New South Wales sent butter
worth £102,502 to London, whereas for
the year ended June 30, 1905, this State sent about £772,000 worth of butter to England.
Thus, in say ten years, our export, despite droughts, has increased more than sevenfold.
As far as quantity is concerned, therefore, our position has been greatly improved. As
regards quality, it may be said that though there was a set back about three years ago, due to
a change of methods on the part of the farmer, we are now on the up grade again, and our best
factories turn out abutter very little if anything behind the best made in any part of the world.


Our weakness lies in the fact that we still manufacture a considerable quantity of butter that
cannot rank as really first-class. This is unavoidable to some extent in a country where so
many are new to the industry, but owing to the wretched cut-throat competition policy of
many factories the desirable stimulus to improve does not exist. It is very little use telling a
farmer his cream is only second quality if a competing factory is willing to pay him top price
for it; and it is hopeless to endeavour to get him to improve his methods so long as this state
of things exists. Thus, the ends of education are defeated, and the industry continues to carry
an unnecessary and undesirable burden. The remedy lies in the universal grading of cream
by standard methods ; and the easiest way of bringing this about is to grade all butter. There
are other ways, but this should prove tire simplest.
MILKING COWS BY MACHINERY.
The development of the industry in the most northern parts of the State,
viz., on the Richmond and Tweed Rivers, has been little short of phenomenal.
There is still room in these districts for a great many more farmers, but the
value of land has increased to such an extent, viz., up to £25 an acre, that

eyes are being turned in other directions as well, and some of the country inland is receiving
attention. Such centres as Mudgee, Inverell, lamworth, Ounuedah, Orange, ( ootamuudra,
and Tumut are being tried.


Along the coast it is quite safe to carry on dairying alone. Except in very
extraordinary years the rainfall will be sufficient to make the success of the
industry a certainty; but when a farmer moves inland to where the rainfall
varies from, say, 27 to .‘lO inches per year, he has to think a bit more. In

such districts the combination of dairying
with wheat-growing, or mutton-raising, or
both, might be entered into. Thus the farmer
will have more than one string to his bow,
and in a year too dry for profitable dairying
he may get a very good crop of wheat,
provided rain falls at opportune times. The
same with mutton-raising, or rather the
breeding of cross-bred lambs for export. This goes very well with dairying, the sheep being
confined to the higher lands and drier pastures, while the milch cows are allowed the run ot
the most succulent foods and grasses. 1 have had considerable experience of this system,
the Shropshire being used for crossing, and the presence of tin* sheep need not in any way
interfere with the profits of the dairy cows. They can be run in the same paddocks as dry
cattle. The farm, however, must be properly subdivided, and a fresh field or paddock provided
for the milch cows as often as possible. There is in New South Wales any quantity of such
land, where good farmers will always be able to make a fair living, but the greater portion ot
such lands are on large estates, which are at present used as sheep-walks, for wool-raising, and
give regular employment to only a comparatively small number of people. It is only now that
New South Wales is recognising the value of the farmer, and that large landowners are
realising the fact that the time has come when farmers are more valuable to the State than
sheep or bullocks. The dawn of agriculture has broken, and closer settlement is destined
to follow. Already many large estates are being voluntarily subdivided, and, in addition,
the Government of this State has resumed a large area for tin* settlement thereon of
agricultural families on easy terms. A great deal of this land, in fact almost all that has been
cut up, is suitable for dairying and mixed farming, and thus is ensured, with fair seasons, a very
large development in the dairying industry. Land similar to what in this State can be bought
for about £5 per acre is let in England and Ireland for about £1 per year rent, and yet butter
is almost as dear, or as valuable to the farmer, in New South Wales as it is in Ireland. Good
farming and good cattle alone are necessary to ensure an almost equal revenue from the land.
With inferior transit arrangements no country can become great in the
butter world. flutter is a substance that spoils easily and rapidly, and
unless the carrying arrangements are such as will prevent its exposure to
weather influences (mainly heat), there is little chance of the manufacturer

presenting a really first-class article for sale at any distance from the factory. Condition of
package is also an important factor affecting sale, and uidess the vehicles for carrying, as well
as the methods of transfer, are first-class, the packages will suffer, and will often be both unclean


and broken. Regularity of arrival is also a necessity. Superior transit arrangements, with
regular deliveries, went a long way towards establishing the Danish and French butter trades
in the secure positions they now enjoy on the London market. The Irish trade, on the contrary,
at one time suffered because of imperfect methods of transfer and transport.
Russia has built up her Siberian butter business greatly by the aid of the very special
arrangements made for the transit of the butter by rail and sea right through to England.
Canada has also greatly improved her butter position in the same way. Australia has
improved very considerably, and, as far as the transit arrangements to London by the best
lines are concerned, the new conditions and lower freights are almost all that can be desired.
The carrying temperature has been guaranteed to be below 20 degrees F., and the value of
this improvement cannot readily be estimated. Better still would be a temperature of
10 degrees F., and this may come in time.
Locally, however, a good deal remains to be done.
It should be a generally accepted rule that butter should not be carried by rail or sea
during the months of October, November, December, January, February, or March, unless in
specially refrigerated vehicles. The vehicles of transfer from rail or boat to store, and vice
versa, should also be of special construction, to prevent weather influences affecting the condi-
tion of the butter or packages.
HERD OF DAIRY CATTLE.


The coastal shipping companies and
the Railway Commissioners in New South
Wales are all improving matters in connection
with the temperature of the carrying vehicles,
but much remains to be done, especially from a
railway point of view. It is to be hoped the
growing importance of the industry will
impress itself on all concerned, and that we
shall not rest satisfied until our carrying conditions are equal to those in any other part
of the world.
The Governments of all countries engaged in dairying have singled out
this industrv for particular assistance. There are many reasons for this.
First, the great income which the world derives from the industry. Second,
the realisation of the fact that, though the production of milk and butter

are as old as man’s records, yet the industry is almost new in its present form, and, therefore,
education to correct old and erroneous ideas is a necessity to progress. Third, if one Govern-
ment assists this industry until all the principals concerned are capable of dealing with its
various phases with the accuracy of a science, it follows as a matter of course that unless other
countries are content to get knocked out of the competition either their Governments or private
benefactors must find the means to provide similar necessary instruction. Denmark probably
led the wav in thorough and organised Government effort, and met the well-known reward.
Every other country has since followed, but some have followed only partly and slowly, in
the Southern Hemisphere the New Zealand Government has made the most advanced and
sustained effort, backing up their instruction by an educational Dairy Industry Act, and their
work has been crowned with success. New South Wales has also done a good deal by
systematic dairy inspection, by itinerary instruction, by education in State agricultural
institutions, and by the supplying to farmers of thorough-bred dairy bulls of various breeds
and of undoubted milking strains.
Though in most countries the pioneer work in factory dairying was done
by private individuals, most of whom had landed interests in the districts,
yet to-day co-operative effort on the part of the farmers is almost everywhere
carrying the standard of progress. Here, again, the Danes were first, Ireland

followed, and now every country of note in dairying is advancing along co-operative lines,
at least as far as production is concerned. This system, with good management, secures to
the producers all the profit possible to be derived from their products.
New South Wales has made great advances in co-operative dairying in recent years,
and we have in this State, perhaps, one of the largest productive co-operative institutions in
the world. It is a very healthy sign of the industry when farmers are found willing to subscribe
money to build these co-operative factories wherever suitable. Many of these deal not only
with butter, but with bacon manufacture also.


Although there never has been any question as to the purity of the supply
of butter from New South Wales, and from Australia generally, yet this
burning question of butter adulteration affects us very materially, and it is
Adulteration.
a great pity that the British Parliament has not yet seen its way to pass into law the much-
talked-of Butter Bill, to prevent, or at least curb, the wholesale adulteration of butter. A
great deal of the unsalted butter sent from Australia this year has unquestionably been used
as a medium for adulteration, both in England and on the continent of Europe. It is a
questionable policy whether it pays to cater for this demand at all. In the first place, the
farthing per lb. extra offered for unsalted little more than covers the loss in weight, as against
salted butter ; and in the second place, it means that instead of daily creating a better demand
from legitimate sellers of Australian butter, a great portion of our very best butter is passed
off under some other name; and when this spurious trade is checked, as it undoubtedly will be
by the Imperial Parliament, where shall we find that the necessary legitimate trade in our butter
has gone ? To some country that has not catered for the “ butter fakers.” The question thus
arises: Does it pay Australia and New Zealand to ship unsalted butter to England ? Certain it
is, however, that our butter interests want very careful watching now in England, and special
trade inspectors, with power to institute prosecutions, appear a necessity, if the fair name
and reputation for purity which Australian butter has gained is not to be sacrificed. Denmark
has always maintained a watchful eye on her British butter trade, and, as a consequence,
adulterated butter is rarely sold as Danish. Australian factories should all trade under a
registered brand, and then, even though it is not at present illegel to mix casein with butter,
the mixture could not legally be sold under the brand of an Australian factory. The same
would, of course, apply to a Government grade or registered brand, if all butter was branded
before export. Of very recent years, perhaps, Holland has made the greatest European
advance in protecting the purity of its creamery butter. The Government has established
control stations, where the butter is examined regularly, and all factories thus controlled are
allowed to use a special state brand guaranteeing the purity of the product. Something
similar might be advisable in New South Wales at this juncture. It could be so arranged
that the box once emptied could never be tilled with butter carrying the Government guarantee
brand of purity.
Although at present there is no special supervision of butter exports, it
must not be forgotten that all the milk, butter, and cheese raised in this
State are produced under the inspection of State officials, and that all cows

are regularly examined from a health point of view. The dairy industry is now established
on a firm basis in New South W ales. To
make it great there only remains the neces-
sity of ensuring that every man’s hand that
touches it shall be clean, that the watchword
of all shall be quality, and that education
shall be progressive and sufficient.

CHAPTER XVII.
Pig-raising.
Pork and Bacon making.
BY H. W. POTTS,
PRINCIPAL, HAWKESBUBY AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.
T may safely be asserted that the natural conditions of
climate, soil, and water supply in Australia are em-
inently favourable for the propagation of animal life
in its highest and healthiest form. Our dry, pure,
rarefied air, the constant presence of sunlight, and the
scanty rainfall in the more remote inland districts, all
combine to produce sweet forms of easily digested and
nutritious natural herbage and grasses. These give an
ideal and effective stimulus to the natural functions
for the production of wool, beef, milk, and pork to a degree unequalled in any other
country. To these highly favourable natural advantages we may largely attribute the almost
phenomenal freedom the domestic animal has from disease in this country.
With the steadily increasing trade in dairy products, it is fair to assume that the raising
of pork must engage the attention of dairymen seeking to find a profitable means of utilising
the most valuable of the dairy by-products. Increased attention to pigs is essential to a
thriving dairy farm, apart from the remunerative position this form of stock-raising occupies
on the general farm.
The trade in dealing with pigs and their products is becoming better
organised, and hence more profitable. Already we have our combined
co-operative butter and bacon factories clearly demonstrating year by year
the possibilities arising from such businesslike organisations. The Danish
example may be quoted to instance the success of such trading concerns.
Organising
the
Trade.
In 1887 Germany closed her ports to live pigs from Denmark, to check the possible invasion of
swine fever. Bacon factories on co-operative lines were established, the first of which commenced
operations at Horsens in 1887. At the end of the year 23,407 pigs, valued at £57,000, were
killed, and the average price paid to the farmer for each pig was £2 9s. The following year
eight factories commenced operations, and in 1902, twenty-seven factories were in full swing.
They dealt with 777,232 pigs, valued at £2,500,000, and the price per pig year by year had
steadily increased in value, and in the year referred to reached £3 4s. 6d. Ihe combined share-
holders’ list numbered 65,800.


In the fifteen years under review the number of pigs killed by these co-operative asso-
ciations totalled 6,731,048, valued at £18,900,000. All the by-products can be turned toprofitable
account under such a system. Each shareholder or farmer enters into a bond to supply his
factory with all pigs raised on the farm. A fine of 11s. 3d. per pig is imposed should this
guarantee be infringed.
This excellent result has been fostered by the State in educating the farmer
by demonstrating improved methods of feeding on a scientific basis, and
by raising the quality of the pig by breeding and selection. It need scarcely
be pointed out that natural conditions in New South Wales are vastly superior
to those existing in such a country as Denmark. Their market is ours,

to raise a greater variety of suitable feeds at a cheap rate. The cost of housing and attention
is decidedly in our favour. The risk of embarking on an export trade and its expansion is
practically minimised by the knowledge that a constantly increasing demand exists in England
for bacon, hams, small pork, and by-products, such as lard. In ten years the value of imports
into Great Britain has doubled.
So long as the demand remains healthy (and there is no prospect of it
being otherwise) the price available in Sydney will pay the producer. The
local markets will be relieved, and, as with butter, steady market rates of
a payable nature will be maintained. The first consideration to the exporter
is the quantity and quality of the raw material; that to the farmer is the

cost of producing the best class of pork, with the least possible waste, in the quickest time,


and at the lowest cost for food and attention. Other things being equal, the best returns will
be secured from pigs that consume the most food in proportion to their live weight.
Well-bred
Pigs
Essential.
The first aim of the pork-raiser is to work into a line or strain of breeding
pigs possessing these important commercial qualifications. Well-bred pigs
are essential to success. Breeding must be supplemented by suitable handling,
intelligent care, sanitary housing, and good feeding. What should be aimed
at are first the selection of a pedigreed boar, virile, sturdy, vigorous, prepotent,
and of a type which will assist in begetting progeny—to produce a large amount of succulent
tender meat of fine texture, strong bones, light offal, a good back, all round development of

regard of most value, and it is the aim of growers to provide these. The Berkshire and Middle
White York breeds have most successfully competed in furnishing these qualities. To the,
farmer commencing business as a pork-raiser the first and most important feature is to select
a well-bred boar from a reputable stud. With this object in view, the Government have

established several large stud pig-herds in connection with the Hawkesbury Agricultural
College, the Experimental Farms, and the Government Asylums ; the herds at these estab-
lishments have been built up from the best imported stock obtainable in England, and are
kept up by frequent importations of new blood ; young boars are obtainable for a moderate
sum. This animal exerts a marked influence in breeding upwards to a point of excellence,
and to the condition most readily acceptable to the consumer. It is, therefore, of the greatest
importance that the boar should be of the highest quality obtainable. In a very short time
the influence of a good boar is manifest in the up-grading of the herd, the young pigs taking
more of the characteristics of the sire than of the dam. The selection of the sow demands
consideration, docility and motherly instincts standing first in her qualifications. Sec that she has
good size through, tine quality of skin, is light in the forequarters, has broad and well let-down
hams, broad hindquarters, large girth, strong back, short legs, well-formed udders, twelve or
more teats, and is cleanly in habit. It is not a thrifty sign for a sow to fatten readily when
breeding. As a rule her litters arc starved and small in number.

In every instance provision must be made for exercise. Clean water,
suitable shelter, and free grazing are important factors in raising healthy
stock. In general farming there is a constant supply of food from some

useless waste products into excellent meat. This is where economy in pork-raising places the
farmer on a sound footing. Where pig food has to be purchased the ledger has to be well kept
and keenly scrutinised to maintain a profit. On the farm a great variety of food can be secured,
and so long as it is palatable the change is noticeable in the increasing weight.
TAMWORTH SOW, HAWKESBURY AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE STUD.
Grazing may be recognised as the bed-rock of success in pig-farming.
The New South Wales climate and conditions favour this form of pig-
feeding, not only for its food constituents, but for healthy digestive action,
sunlight, and constant exercise. It may be roughly estimated that half the
carcass can be grown on natural pasturage, more certainly, however, where
stubbles and the wastes of crops and fodders can be gathered by the pigs.
The
Bed-rock
of
Success.
The cultivation of special fodder, grain and root crops for pigs, invariably ensures a good return,
and in arranging farm crops, particularly in following a rotation, pigs and sheep are necessary
adjuncts to its successful application in restoring soil fertility. We have not yet fully recognised
the importance of rotating crops and using the domestic animals for eating some of them down.

The dairy farmer has a constant supply of skim milk ; it forms the basis
of a profitable ration, being a good flesh-former in itself, and it renders other
fattening material such as grain, pollard, and other carbonaceous foods more
digestible. It has been shown that 10 gallons of skim milk will produce

5 lb. of pork, and 1 bushel of maize will produce 10 lb. pork, but when fed together the result

milk. The Danes obtain the best results with barley and skim milk. The best gains have
been made with barley, skim milk, and potatoes.

CHAPTER XVIII.
Mixed Fanning.
BY G. M. McKEOWN,
MANAGER OF THE WAGGA WAOGA EXPERIMENT FARM.
ERHAPS the most general system of mixed farming, as the
M term is commonly understood, is sheep-raising and wheat
production, but it will be at once appreciated that the
great range of climate and varied soils of New South
Wales make it possible for the farmer to extend these
operations very materially, according to the district in
which his holding is situated. There is dairying—to
mention the most prominent of the other main lines of
rural activity—and the dairyman is now gradually
pushing his way back from the coastal garden to the splendid but slightly drier areas of the
tablelands, and even beyond to the edges of the Western slopes. As he goes inland the
dairyman becomes acquainted with the mysteries and profits of mutton-raising, wool production,
fruit-growing, and wheat, oats, and barley growing. This is giving rise to a somewhat
extensive system of mixed farming, which is almost universally recommended as good for the
farmer’s pocket, and highly beneficial to the soil.
The mixed farmer must have fairly good land, and a reliable rainfall, and
as these conditions obtain generally throughout the agricultural belt the
practice will doubtless become the rule, except in those districts where on
big estates wheat-growing is carried on on a mammoth scale to the exclusion
Will become
the Rule.
of all other pursuits.
The system of mixed farming is based upon the rotation of the crops and stock found
most suited to the conditions of a district. There are many crops from which to choose, and
many lines of stock can be taken which are admirably adapted to New South Wales conditions.
One of the first considerations upon a farm is a remunerative outlet for the products. In this
connection the export trade must be looked to as offering a never-failing outlet for certain
products at a price. The principal lines coming under this category are wool, mutton, wheat,
butter, bacon, and fruits. There are many other avenues of local importance which are liable
to serious fluctuations ; but the lines mentioned are the most stable, and are worthy of the
main attention of the settler.


Mixed farming minimises the risk of complete failure, such as is incurred
when everything is staked upon only one line of agriculture. It allows of
monetary returns being received more often during the year, which means
that many requirements can be purchased for cash. This is a distinct
advantage. It provides for a rational division of labour for both men and

teams throughout the year, which considerably relieves the monotony. By mixed farming,
also, considerably larger returns can be obtained from a given area, and the soil fertility retained
instead of being lost.
The practice up to the present has been to grow wheats and other cereals for a number
of years, and when the returns have fallen so low, owing to the partial exhaustion of the soil,
as to prove unremunerative, to devote the areas to stock, principally sheep. The vast area
of virgin soils awaiting occupation has militated against the better management of many of
the older agricultural districts, and a system of Arab farming has been encouraged which is
not altogether in the best interests of the State. This has led to slip-shod methods of specu-
lative farming, which lacks thoroughness and stability, essentials in successful and progressive
agriculture.
TURNING UP THE GROUND AT THE WAGGA FARM.


STUD RAMS, KINROSS.
When the large tracts of virgin country have been settled and put under
the plough, more intense culture must be practised, and there are immense
possibilities in the system of mixed farming which will eventually become
universal along the agricultural belt. Comparatively small areas will under

a more advanced system of agriculture yield larger returns than much larger areas were capable
of producing under the old-time methods. Better provision will be made for periods of scarcity,
and it is in this respect that the training of the British farmer will more than compensate for
his initial lack of knowledge of Australian conditions, information upon which will be available
to him from many sources.
Sheep-farming, as distinguished from sheep-grazing on the big stations in
the West, is largely carried on already by wheat-growers, and is proving a
valuable auxiliary to the cultivation of cereals. Recently the small holder

has begun to turn his attention from the merino, grown almost solely for wool, to the British
breeds, with an eye to the export of frozen mutton and lamb. The Shropshire and merino
cross is one which will prove most profitable. The sheep are run on the stubble and cultivation

wheat land of plants which afford good pasture, but which are objectionable in crops. They
also perform very useful work in clearing stubbles of grain which has been shed at harvest
time, thus converting into mutton and wool that which would otherwise be lost, and at the
same time fertilising the land. As the general trend by small growers or mixed farmers is in
the direction of producing a mutton sheep, particulars of demonstrations made at the Wagga
Experimental Farm, which showed that this branch of the industry is the most profitable for
small landholders, will prove of interest. The following figures show the earnings of a flock
of Lincoln-merino ewes for 1905, the expenditure not including interest or rent of land :
The rental value of the land would of course vary with the locality, stock-
carrying capacity, and improvements ; land values in the Wagga district,
where the above-mentioned experiment took place, ranging between £2 10s.
and £6 per acre. In ringbarked land, suitable for wheat-growing, the natural

portions of the year this may be considerably exceeded, and the writer has in a good season
fed 1,400 sheep and lambs on 300 acres for four months. The land had been cultivated and
fertilised for wheat, and in alternate
years had been allowed to grow grass.
In land continuously cultivated,
however, the grasses disappear, and
they are not easily replaced. The
grazing referred to was in the
growing season, which usually ends in
November, when the grass dries, and
very little new growth takes place
until March or April, when the seed of
the annual varieties germinates and the perennial kinds put forth new growth. The keeping of a
flock of ewes according to the capacity of the farm, for the purpose of raising lambs for market,
will be found to be profitable, the returns from this source making a very substantial addition to


the income derivable from wool. One of the best crosses for the purpose is made by mating
Shropshire rams with Lincoln-merino cross-bred ewes. The best time for joining rams and
ewes is about the middle of November, so as to provide for the lambing taking place at a time
when fair pasture is usually available. This also admits of the lambs being old enough for
market before the grass-seed has ripened, the seed usually being liable to prove a source of
trouble. If it is desired to hold the lambs for sale to a later age, they should be shorn. The
lambs are marketable at 4 to 5 months, and by selling them before the heat of summer sets
in, the flock is greatly reduced in numbers, and the difficulty of maintaining the ewes is pro-
portionately lessened.
MOREE RAILWAY YARD.
As a subsidiary industry, dairying, to some extent, may be carried on in
suitable localities, but especial regard should be had to local markets, as
the returns will naturally be affected by the local demand for dairy products.
An essential feature in dairying requirements is a supply of pure water in
all seasons, preferably obtained from running streams. Provision should

also be made for the summer months by the conservation of fodder by means of ensilage, and
such supplies may be provided in connection with cereal farming. The heaviest fodder crops
are obtainable from varieties which may be sown in the autumn, and the best of these will be
found to be barley with vetches or peas. With irrigation, heavy crops of maize and sorghum
may be raised on the river flats, and fair crops of the latter may be grown on the higher lands


with the aid of fertilisers. One of the most suitable breeds will be found to be the Jerseys,
as they have proved hardy under all conditions, as well as consistent yielders of milk of high
quality.
In many districts the “ mixed ” farmer will grow oats and barley, as well
as wheat. Barley grows to perfection in certain parts of the State, and the
cultivation of this grain is a most profitable pursuit. Wheaten hay is
largely used for fodder, and its cultivation and preparation for the Sydney
Cereals other
than Wheat.
markets form a lucrative branch of agriculture largely followed in Riverina and other farming
districts. The crop is, under these circumstances, cut into chaff before being sold.
In addition to the other pursuits mentioned, there is fruit-growing, which
affords another avenue of activity to the mixed farmer. The climate of New
South Wales is so varied and the soils so diverse in character that there is
hardly a district of the State in which some fruits cannot be grown with
advantage. Fuller information upon this subject will be obtained from the

chapter upon fruit-growing. It is only mentioned here as an illustration of the range of crops
which the agriculturist who wishes to get the best results out of his land may command. There
are properties in the Northern Rivers district where may be seen growing side-by-side fruits
of various kinds, sugar-cane, maize, and root crops, while the main area of the holding is
devoted to depasturing dairy cattle. In the Bathurst district and on the Northern and
Southern tablelands are grown some of the best apples in the world, and there is a big future
before the export trade of this fruit. And in Riverina the soil and climate are well suited for
the growth of grapes, apricots, cherries, and plums, while some varieties of peaches, apples,
pears, almonds, and walnuts thrive well. By a system of thorough cultivation, the settler
can supply all his own requirements in these fruits, and it has been proved that a profitable
industry may be established in Riverina in the production of raisins and other dried fruits.
Ihe farmer will also find it profitable to raise poultry, which can be done in conjunction with
any other line of agricultural work. This matter is, however, dealt with fully in the chapter
on poultry.

of the year, while in the coastal areas frosts are in many places of rare occurrence, even
during the coldest months.
In several districts at an elevation of from 1,500 to 3,500 feet along the
tablelands, English fruits do as well as on their native soil. These table-
lands stretch through the State parallel with the 500 miles coast fine, and
at a distance from the sea of from 20 to 150 miles. The rainfall over this
area varies from 20 to 50 inches per annum, and orchards which receive

proper cultivation, pruning, thinning, &c., carry good crops of fruit during even the worst
season. On these higher levels the climate is all that can be desired—the heat in the summer
seldom becoming oppressive and the cold days during the winter being few indeed. On the
highest levels there are on rare occasions light falls of snow, which, however, usually disappear
at once or within a day or two. In this particular belt lies some of our best mixed farming
country, where fruit-growing can be combined with dairying, cereal growing, and stock raising,
and can be made a profitable adjunct to the latter industries.
Again, on our Northern Rivers, in close proximity to the coast, where dairying is the
principal industry, pineapples, bananas, mangoes, paw-paws, passion, and citrus fruits can
be grown in the more sheltered places, while throughout most of the coastal country, and up
to an elevation of 1,500 feet, large quantities of peaches, plums, pears, apples, passion- fruit,
citrus fruits, and grapes are cultivated. It is on this area that most of our fruit for local
consumption is grown, as well as large quantities for the local jam factories and canneries.


The factories are now putting up immense quantities of the very best jams and fruits,
which find ready sale, not only in New South Wales but in neighbouring States and other
countries. There is no practical reason why these industries should not go on extending, as
we can grow as good peaches, plums, and similar fruits in quantities, as can be produced any-
where in the world.
The local fruit trade alone is of considerable magnitude, as although fruit
could be grown in almost every garden in New South Wales there are few
residents of the city who have sufficient ground to spare for fruit-trees ;
indeed there are many farmers who do not grow the fruit necessary for their

own requirements, and, consequently, there is always a large demand for fruit of good quality,
which usually commands a fair price.
In the spring-time, when the trees are coming into bloom, there is nothing more enjoy-
able than a drive through some of the fruit-growing districts, where on every side one sees
thousands of trees in
bloom, while the air is
filled with the most
fragrant perfumes of

soms. Then again,
later, when the fruit is

handled like eggs and packed in cases, each of which contains carefully graded fruit, so
arranged in layers that when the box is full and ready to be nailed down, preparatory to
being forwarded to market, it presents a beautiful picture. Next comes the carting to the
railway station and loading into trucks, where, at some of our larger fruit-growing centres,
you will meet dozens of other growers with their loads of fruit.
After the fruit is lauded in the city or town to which it is consigned, it has to
be taken from the trucks to the fruit-market where it is displayed. When sold it still


has to make two or three other trips before
finally reaching the table of the consumer,
and one often wonders how it stands all
this handling.
To make fruit-growing a profitable
industry there are a good many things to
be attended to. To begin with, the grower
requires to see that he plants nothing but
those varieties which find the greatest
favour with the consumer, and which
carry good crops of fruit every year.

When once he has decided what to plant he must see that the trees receive careful attention,
and that the spraying, pruning, thinning, cultivation, destruction of insect pests, and marketing
are all done on the most up-to-date Unes.
My previous remarks apply chiefly to those fruits grown for local consump-
tion, which is an industry of considerable importance; but there are great
possibilities in the export trade, not only in fresh but in dried fruits also.
At the present time a few citrus and stone fruits are being exported to other

States, with perhaps a few apples from orchards so situated that they find it more convenient
to send their fruit to either Brisbane or Melbourne rather than to Sydney ; and many districts
which produce fruit earlier than can be done in some of the adjoining States send their crops
to outside markets, where it usually finds ready sale at remunerative prices.
Of oranges and lemons we produce great quantities, and export largely to New Zealand
Tasmania, Victoria, and other States. We have not, however, succeeded in profitably landing
large quantities on the English market; but with better cold storage facilities on the steamers,
there is no reason why we should not be able to supply the English market with oranges, in
hundreds of thousands of cases, if there was a demand for such fruit in August and September
of every year.
Passion-fruit is another variety which can be grown to perfection in this State, and if, with
improved facilities on the boats, we could succeed in landing this fruit on the London market,
the demand, when it became known, would, I believe, be unlimited. This latter fruit does
particularly well on the poorer light soils, in districts where frosts are not severe.
Take again the apple trade : there are thousands of acres of land in the
cooler climates admirably adapted to the culture of the very best apples,
which, if grown in quantities, should prove profitable for exporting after the
local demand was supplied. At present, though, in place of being exporters

of this fruit, we are importing annually about 500,000 cases. There is, therefore, a big opening
for those who wish to grow apples, as they will find a ready market locally for years to come.




On the western slopes lying at the back of the mountain ranges can be found some of
the best land in Australia for the production of fruits for canning and drying purposes, and
for citrus fruits more suitable than the coastal grown varieties for export.
Among those which are the most suitable for drying are the following :
Raisin grapes, sultanas, Zante currants, figs, peaches, apricots, the latter
three varieties being suitable for canning and jam-making as well. Locally
canned fruits are stated by experts to be the best on the world’s markets.

above sea level. Here the summers are warmer and the bright sunny days are just what is
required for the successful growing of such fruits, which require the higher temperature to
dry them in order to turn out a first-class article. These fruits, when ripe, are picked and
placed on clean wooden trays until dry, and are never allowed to touch the ground, as are
many of the imported fruits, in which are frequently found small pebbles, soil, and other
foreign ingredients. Our fruit is, therefore, clean and wholesome, and this to the ordinary
Britisher should be its strongest recommendation. There is room and to spare for thousands
of people to grow such fruits for drying, and where a good many are engaged at this work

area it is quite

is not far distant when we shall grow
enough of these fruits for our own mar-
ket, and have a large surplus for export;
and for the person whose heart is in the
work, and who is prepared to work on the
most up-to-date fines, there is a big open-
ing. The State Government is talking of
starting a large irrigation scheme, which
will command some of the best land in
this State, and when the scheme is in
running order the Government will be in a position to offer favourable inducements to those
who wish to go into fruit-growing on a commercial scale.
Valuable
Government
Aid.
At the Government Experimental Orchards, which are situated in different
climates and districts, large collections of the various fruits are growing; so
that we are in a position to say with a fair degree of accuracy which varieties
do best in each particular district. There are also many private orchardists
who are only too pleased to give to the newcomer the advantage of their
experiments, and, therefore, he is saved the trouble of having to pay for his experience by
experimenting with many varieties in order to ascertain which is most suitable for his particular
district. There are also several good nurseries where the best stocks can be procured, and
where the nurserymen are in a position to guarantee that the trees are worked on the most
approved stocks. Ido not know of any place where worked nursery stock in good condition
for planting can be purchased at so reasonable a price.
The Government is always willing to put at the disposal of the grower all the informa-
tion he may need, and he can at all times visit the Departmental orchards to see how the
various branches of the work are carried out. This is of considerable importance to the beginner
as he can usually pick up the information he requires, or obtain advice on any matter about
which he is in doubt.

CHAPTER XX.
Viticulture.
BY M. BLUNNO.
HE immense territory of a new country like Australia
enables the colonising population to pursue widely
diversified agricultural enterprises, inasmuch as the
variety of soils, and principally the variety of climates,
are the consequence of the diversity of the hydro-
graphic and orographic features of the country and of
its extensive range of latitude. That is the reason
why, in new countries, we often find districts where
tropical plants are grown for industrial purposes, while
in another district we may find cultures that are
characteristic of temperate and even cold climates. Then the extensive territory affords the
settling population the choice of the district and the soil in which any particular form of
culture can be most profitably followed up, thus leaving nothing to chance. The natural
fertility of a virgin soil adds to the advantages just mentioned ; while the liberality of the
Governments of new countries, the more democratic laws—all directed to assist exploiting
the natural wealth of the soil, the absence of clashing and firmly established interests existing
in older communities, coupled with energy and intelligence—often the only heritage of the
emigrant—cannot fail to produce the highest results.
A glance at the map of New South Wales, and a perusal of the meteorological reports,
will convince anyone that in many districts of this State viticulture ought to find a natural
abode. Sunny lands are the home of the grape-vine, this queen of industrial plants ; and
New South Wales has been given, long ago, that epithet of brightness.
In the whole of Australia some 60,000 acres have already been devoted to
viticulture, which is not as great an expansion as might well have been, and
does not come up to the greater impulse given to vine-growing in new
countries by no means better favoured in the way of natural advantages. In
Room for
Expansion.
several of the South American Republics, in a much shorter time, viticulture, wine-making,
and distillation have attained a larger development. The reason is one of racial habit and art
of living. The population of Australia is of the Anglo-Saxon breed, who, in their glorious
birth-place, cannot follow vine-growing on account of the bitterness of the climate in many
parts, and its inclemency and uncertainty in others, where, nevertheless, the yearly mean
temperature is the same as that of some of the most famous vine-growing districts of their
o


southern neighbours. The art of living of a people depends almost exclusively on the nature
of their agricultural pursuits. The Anglo-Saxon, not being a vine-grower, is not a wine-drinker
in the true meaning of the word.
Viticulture can be carried on over a great expanse of the Commonwealth, and the Austra-
lian will in time become a wine-drinker. An inveterate habit like that of drinking the
fermented and distilled product of grains cannot be eradicated in the course of a generation
or two, notwithstanding the mild climate of Australia, which should at once induce people to
prefer lighter alcoholic stimulants. Change of diet cannot be effected at one stroke ; it is a
matter of acquired taste. This is brought about by degrees, until it establishes itself like a
second nature.
It behoves those in authority, who have to guide the community to the goal of a leading
place in general progress and prosperity, to consider viticulture in the light of one of the most
important agricultural enterprises for the permanent settlement of people on the land. Viti-
culture has the character of permanency. A well-planted and well looked after vineyard
lasts, in the economical sense, forty years or so. There you have at once two generations
working in it. Cellars and appliances and casks last a long time, and can hardly be turned to
any other purpose. Viticulture and, still more so, wine-making require a certain knowledge
that is gained by proper training, which the children of a vigneron and wine-maker take as
part of the family heritage. That is why viticulture, once started, is followed in a direct line
by the children of those who first commence.
Growing grape-vines means extensive employment of labour; and vine-growing districts
are, after the manufacturing and mining centres, the most densely populated. Emigration
from vine-growing countries is nil; immigration, on the contrary, is to be looked for. When
the French vineyards disappeared almost entirely from some districts of France, under that
terrible scourge of phylloxera, the population thinned out at the same rate as the vineyards
were destroyed by the plague.
A NEW SOUTH WALES VINEYARD.


I have seen many families in this State who live very comfortably on some
ten acres of vineyard. There has never been yet in New South Wales a
supply of wine greater than the demand, Vignerons sell their wines with the
greatest ease, and the one million of gallons, which is about the average

any urgent necessity of getting rid of it at any price. Wine is not a perishable product if it
is well looked after; on the contrary, with care and age it increases in value. Most of the
wine produced in this State is sold by the vignerons to the wine merchants during the
first twelve months following the vintage, thus leaving to the merchants all the cares of treat-
ment and maturing. Yet the vigneron makes a profit, which averages from £lO to £ls per
acre —that is, for vineyards of a certain acreage, where outsiders are employed in the vineyard
and cellar work; but for smaller places, where the labour is done by the men folk of the family,
the net profit is still higher.
The cost of establishing a vineyard and bringing it into bearing is about £25 per acre
at the outside. The costly hand-trenching of the ground, in the generality of cases, now cafi
be dispensed with, on account of the many patterns of ploughs and subsoilers, which, with the
proper strength, can reach a depth of twenty inches. On behalf of the Agricultural Depart-
ment, I had in 1901 thirty-one acres of land, which had just been cleared of a rather thick
and heavy timber, ploughed and subsoiled to the average depth of twenty inches, at the cost
of £9 10s. per acre.
Vignerons in New South Wales, though not forming a very large community, make a
nice living, and this is borne out by the look of their homesteads, the happiness in their family
relations, and the easy life that they enjoy. I have had the privilege of visiting most pf the


vine-growers of this State, and always left edified with the appearance of everything, and
with their amiability and hospitality ; and even when I examined their position from a critic’s
point of view, I could see that it was not show, but substance.
Yet the vignerons of New South Wales have so far only concerned them-
selves in the making of wines, and have neglected to utilise the by-products of
this industry. In Southern Europe the grape skins (husks), after ferment-
ation, are worth about 30s. per ton, and the wine-lees more than that. A
Waste of
By-Products.
considerable amount of spirit can be obtained from them, while they are the only raw material
from which cream of tartar and tartaric acid can be obtained.
Australia imports every year thousands of pounds worth of both these substances,
largely employed in domestic economy and in medicine, when they could be prepared here.
The Agriculture Department has often been asked to forward to European manufacturers
samples of wine-lees and wine-stone, and has unfailingly received reports confirming the high
percentage of pure cream of tartar contained. I have tested the wine-stone from a few cellars
in the Hunter River, and found as much as 85*5 per cent, of pure cream of tartar.
The reason why nothing has been done to turn into profit the by-products of wine-
making is that vignerons have found wine-making by itself profitable enough without spend-
ing more energy in a secondary enterprise. But what is only a secondary enterprise for the
individual may be the principal business of a collective institution, which could buy from the
vignerons the raw
material and re-
fine it. The vig-
nerons can easily

of the wine-stone would then come within the domain of a factory. Such a factory as would
limit itself solely to refill’ ng the wine-stone and obtaining cream of tartar would not need large


capital, and the working expenses would be small. At present I would not recommend the manu-
facture of tartaric acid, which requires large expense at the outset for buildings and machinery.
Delicious wines are not the monopoly of any particular country, and
though the continent of Europe undoubtedly holds the lead in the produc-
tion and commerce of fine wines, yet no expert ever averred that those
produced outside the boundaries of that country are necessarily inferior to
the European wines.

vintages; and, finally, we find in Australia a large stock of good, sound, wholesome wines,
among which there are not a few of excellent character that vie with the best and most
high-priced wines produced in any other continent.
People in general are conservative in matters of taste. This may or may not be a fault ;
but what is surely regrettable is to see people “ drinking a name.”
The real connoisseur is unprejudiced : he pleases his palate, not his imagination : he cares
not for fashion ; he makes it. Anyone who has followed the various events in the viticultural
development of different countries knows full well that the production of certain crris (vintages
of certain vineyards) which have a world-wide fame is very small, and of late years through
the ravages of phylloxera among French vineyards, the proportion has been still further
reduced to almost an infinitesimal quantity. Yet the amount of wine sold under the label of
famous crds is altogether out of proportion to the quantity of the genuine article produced.
The quality of wine depends on four factors, which are soil, climate, variety of grapes,
and manufacture.


In the preceding paragraph of this article I have hinted at the variety
of soils in New South Wales, many of which are exceedingly suited to
vine-growing for wine-making purposes. The climate, also, is splendid.
Then the best accredited sorts of wine-grapes have been imported from

we have a class of intelligent, well-to-do, practical vignerons and wine-makers who know how
to make most of the natural advantages of this country. It would be invidious for me to
single out anyone for public recognition ; but it is a pleasure to have to say that the progress
made during the last few years is enormous. The seeds of knowledge fell in good ground ; the
keen capacity of the vine-growers for seizing information and turning it to practical account
has been to me always a source of delight. Five years ago the question of controlling the

temperature of the fermenting juice was absolutely ignored by the many; now it is generally one
of the most important operations at fermentation time. The different devices for preventing
a rise of the temperature in the fermenting vats have been largely adopted. Preference
is given in many cellars to the cement vats which allow of a greater dispersion of heat than
the wooden ones. Many are the contrivances for seration and cooling down of the juice ;
and, according to the importance of the cellar, they range from an ordinary wooden pump or
coils, through which runs fresh water, to the last pattern of must-refrigerators. The turbinaye
of white musts is a modern practice which is now being followed with great success in certain
cellars. By imparting to the must a centrifugal movement at the speed of only 500 to 600
revolutions per minute, a decrease of from 18° to 20° Fahrenheit in the initial temperature of
the juice is obtained, followed by a quicker separation of the sediment, thus ensuring a purer
fermentation and increasing the sound-keeping qualities of the wine. Steam-power is more
largely diffused, and up-to-date labour-saving plants are more largely employed for the
hoisting up of the grapes, crushing them, and separating the stalks. Continuous presses
have also been imported, and

corrected erroneous ideas, and displaced inveterate prejudices, with the result that the wines
are better, the profits higher. Several large vineyards have been recently planted ; many of
them are already in bearing; more new and well-appointed cellars have been built.
The great variety of soils and climates in New South Wales necessarily impresses a
variety of characters to the wines produced.
We have the wines of Corowa and Albury, where the wine merchant finds
the parallel to the products from the vineyards round the basin of the Mediter-
ranean sea, with one important advantage in favour of our Riverina wines—
that the class of grapes cultivated here is the Syrah (Australian Hermitage,

Black Shiraz), which, in a climate just as hot and dry as many districts of South Europe, gives
wines superior to the Barletta, Milazzo, Riporto, Alicante, Benincarlo, Huesca, and Aragona,
which are not drinkable by themselves, so heavy and rough are they unless blended.
The red dry wines of Albury and Corowa are rich in colour and extractive substance,
with an alcoholic strength ranging from between 22 and 25 per cent, of proof spirit, clean to
the palate, wholesome, and blood-making. After about three years of proper care and treatment,
when they have lost the natural roughness of young wines, they develop a marked bouquet
and fragrance which deservedly confer on them “ the honour of the bottle.” These wines, as a

basis of another
important busi-
ness —the export


trade. Any wines grown in that district, as long as they are dry, clean to the palate, sound,
and full-bodied, are sold in bulk, at a very remunerative price, to London buyers, who, as a
rule, prefer them when only 18 months old. They are consumed in England, which speaks well
for those wines, considering the fastidious taste of the English wine-drinker. There is such
immense scope in the export trade that the only thing necessary is to grow more and organise
a proper system of marketing; the latter, however, is outside the province of the vignerons
themselves, and demands the attention of skilled business men.

who admire landscapes —and every man does who can, in these prosaic times, contemplate
the beautiful—should visit this district or the Paterson. Those who love to be reminded of
old Home will find in the Hunter River vine district a vista which gladdens the heart, while
the invigorating air and the picturesqueness of the country, inviting to outdoor life, are sources
of physical and mental vigour.
The vineyards, like green dazzling gems, emerge from the sombre hue of the wood, the
homesteads coquettishly built at the summit of the hills enjoy the glittering pomp of sapphire
and gold, which envelops the land for miles around —veritably a vision to evoke the muses.


What shall I say of the wines of the Hunter Valley—of its clarets like molten rubies,
of its Chablis, Hocks, and Sauternes like liquid gold, of their delicate fragrance that tickles
the palate and gives the pleasure of a prelibation. They are a happy combination of
nourishing elements in which there is not one discordant ingredient, making a harmoniously
palatable whole, the proper assimilation of which brightens the face of the happy epicure,
gives his thoughts lucidity, wit to his tongue, an unusual power to his digestive organs,
and leaves him, after the feast, fitter for work, and without anything to regret.
Precious wines are not limited only to the Riverina and to the Hunter River districts,
as we find entensive vineyards and huge cellars in the County of Cumberland, and on the
Hawkesbury River, only a few miles from the metropolis; also around Mudgee and Tamworth, in
the New England district, there are many vineyards where the cooler climate confers on the
wine a characteristic affinity with the wines produced in the colder vine-growing districts of
continental Europe.

With such climate and soil, some of the best sort of grapes, intelligence, and capital,
Australians and all Britishers should realise the particularly suitable conditions for the pro-
duction of fine vintages. The grape-vine in Australian soil finds a magic crucible where the
juice of the earth is transformed by the sun’s rays into a goodly beverage, a fitting reward to
the toil of its inhabitants in conquering this Continent for civilisation. It is but ignorance or
envy that has attempted to create a prejudice against them.
The high quality of our Australian wines should be more loudly proclaimed for the
truth’s sake, and for patriotic reasons. What better recommendation can they carry than
that of strangers from continental Europe—generally connoisseurs of wines—naturally with
a leaning to praise the wines of their own country above every other, and yet bound to admit,
in surprised delight, the fineness of the fermented grape-juice of this fair land.

PICKING GRAPES.
For the purpose of determining varieties of phylloxera-resistant vines best
adapted to the requirements of vine-growers in various parts of the State, who
wish to avail themselves of this means of protecting their vineyards from the
ravages of phylloxera, should the pest unfortunately spread beyond the
limited area to which it is now restricted, nurseries have been established
in several districts. The principal one is at Howlong. There the collection of varieties will


he kept as complete as possible, for demonstrative purposes, in several classes of soil, varying
in texture and chemical composition. Cuttings and rooted vines are sold at a nominal rate,
and every opportunity is taken to instruct vine-growers as to best stocks to use and how to
work them. An average of 60,000 rootlings and cuttings of phylloxera-resistant vines have so
far been distributed annually.
In December, 1902, an Act against the adulteration of wines was passed,
and an oenologic laboratory for the analysis of wines has since been attached
to the Viticultural Branch of the Government Service. Samples of wines

order to prevent manipulations that would reduce the wholesomeness and nourishing proper-
ties of this beverage. However, it is satisfactory to note that in three years since the enact-
ment of the law only a few sporadic cases of adulteration have come under the notice of the
ever-vigilant authority, cases which, needless to say, have been severely dealt with.

This industry is one of the most remunerative, and already a third of the

such cases are numerous, and will be found mostly within the metropolitan area of Sydney.


A crop of 3 tons per acre is an ordinary one, and good early and late kinds fetch at least 2d.

father with a son of 18 can do all that is required in the way of tillage, of winter and summer
pruning, spraying, grape picking, packing, and marketing, and yet not fail for days of leisure
through the year. It is obvious that the secret of the success lies in being near a centre of
population, and in growing principally such varieties as are amongst the first or the last to
ripen, so as to avoid the time of glut. Late grapes are sold on the Sydney market which
have been grown 300 or 400 miles away.
Table grapes in this State grow to perfection, the bunches attain extraordinary sizes,
are juicy, have fine colour, and most delicate flavour. White Sherry, Black Hamburg, Black
Muscat Hamburg, Muscat of Alexandria, Chasselas, and Doradillo are about the principal
varieties grown, besides forty or fifty more varieties more or less predominating.
So far the raisin industry is pursued on a very limited scale. Yet there is a great
scope, considering the local demand and the fact that this State is still tributary to other
countries for its supply.

its annual value being about half the total produc-
tion. While the bulk of the sheep shorn are at
present run on the big stations and held in vast
Hocks numbered by the hundred thousand, the ten-
dency is for the smaller holder to go in for wool-
growing. As is mentioned elsewhere, in the chapter on Mixed Farming, comparatively small
holders are finding it profitable to rest their land from wheat-growing by running sheep upon
it; and close to the coast where wheat is not grown, and the country is not so suitable for
the production of merino wool, the English breeds, greatly the superior of the merino for mutton
purposes, are being raised in increasing numbers as an adjunct to agricultural pursuits.
At the end of the 1905-1906 shearing season it was estimated that there were between
40,000,000 and 42,000,000 sheep in New South Wales. The flocks increase very fast in favour-
able seasons, and with the spread of the smaller flocks among the fanners the number may be
expected to increase steadily year by year in spite of possible adverse conditions. Future
droughts should not so seriously diminish the numbers of the sheep depastured as those of the
past, inasmuch as station-owners have realised the possibilities of hand-feeding when the
natural pastures give out, owing to dry weather ; and an extension of this system (the fodder
being grown on irrigated plots) would not only keep the sheep through a drought, but would
materially augment the carrying capacity of the country. So that the possibilities of the
State in the direction of producing that magnificent merino wool which has made the name
of New South Wales famous throughout the civilised world would seem to be boundless.
The history of sheep-breeding in New South Wales goes back to the
eighteenth century. Captain Macarthur, to whose enterprise and foresight
the pastoral industry is immensely indebted, owned a flock of 1,000 sheep
in 1795. These animals were held in high estimation, and gradually increased
in value until ten years later the market price of a fat wether had risen to

£5. Captain Macarthur imported some fine Spanish merino rams and ewes from the Cape of


(rood Hope, and by careful breeding in a few years he so improved the strain that he obtained
fleeces of a very fine texture, which met with the ready appreciation of English manufacturers.
Macarthur was not, it is believed, the first to introduce merino sheep into Australia ; but, at
any rate, to him is due the credit of having been the first to prove that the production of fine
wool could be made a profitable industry in New South Wales.
Prior to the last century the production of the finest wool had been confined chiefly
to Spain, and woollen manufactures were necessarily carried on in England upon a somewhat
limited scale, which was not likely to improve, in face of certain restrictions which the operatives
endeavoured to place upon their employers. These men, in support of their contention that
the woollen trade could not be expanded on account of the limited supply of raw material,
argued that fine wool was obtainable only in Spain ; and it was at this favourable period that
Macarthur arrived in England with specimens of the wool obtained from his finest sheep,
conclusively proving the capabilities of Australia as a wool-producing country. In this way
he opened up with the English manufacturers a small trade which, as Australian wool rose
in public estimation, gradually increased until it reached its present enormous dimensions.
The Australian climate has in some respects changed the character of the
Spanish fleece. The wool has become softer and more elastic, and while it
has diminished in density it has increased in length, and the weight of the
fleece has grown considerably heavier. Thus on the whole the quality of
the wool has improved under the beneficial influence of the climate, and if

reducing the number from 41,857,099 in 1901 to 26,649,424 in 1902. In spite of a bad
season there was an increase of 2,000,000 in 1903, while in the two years following—the
seasons being bountiful—the increase was phenomenal, no fewer than 12,000,000 sheep having
been added to the flocks since 1903 ; the number at the close of 1905 being returned as
between 40,000,000 and 42,000,000. As previously stated, it is unlikely that any future
drought will have such a serious effect on the flocks as those of 1901-2, as the lesson then
learned has been taken to heart, and pastoralists are generally making provision for the
conservation of fodder, while “ mixed ” farmers are raising smaller flocks in conjunction with
cultivation, so that the danger from adverse seasons is being materially lessened. Certainly
the prospects before the pastoral industry have never been so bright as at the present time.
The numbers of sheep in individual flocks have changed greatly in recent
years. In 1891 there were only 13,187 holdings, but in 1904 the number
had increased to 17,755, although the sheep depastured had decreased by
over 27,000,000. It is significant to note that while in 1891 there were
seventy-three holdings where each carried over 100,000 sheep, the number

in 1901 was twelve, and in 1904 only five. The sheep in flocks of over 20,000 comprised 62
per cent, of the total in 1891, but only 36 per cent, in 1904.
p


The
Remarkable
Increase.
The rapid manner in which the flocks of the State increase under favourable
conditions is remarkable. After allowing for the causes which naturally
impede the increase, such as the demands of the slaughter-yard, the require-
ments of the neighbouring States, and losses, it will be found that the rate
of annual increase has been as high as 20 per cent., so that it is possible
for the flocks of New South Wales to increase two-fold in about four years. Actual experience
shows that such rate of increase occurred in 1904, and in several of the earlier years. During
the period of five years from 1861 to 1866 there was a two-fold increase, and the flocks of the
State were again doubled in the eight years from 1866 to 1874, and in the thirteen years from
1874 to 1887. The stock-carrying capabilities of New South Wales are very difficult to estimate,
as the greater portion of the country is yet in its natural state. Improvements such as the
subdivision of pasturage, a better system of water conservation and irrigation, an intelligent
extension of the growth of saltbush, cotton-bush, and other drought-resisting shrubs and
natural grasses, and the cultivation of artificial fodder, are gradually being effected, and will
indefinitely extend the capacity for supporting stock of all descriptions.

developed apparently to its utmost capacity, both in quality and quantity, the breeders turned
their attention to the task of increasing the skin area on which the wool grew. To this end
the American Vermont merino was introduced, and the wrinkly folds of the skin on this
sheep provided a much greater growing area. These folds are also to be found on other sheep,
the Tasmanian merino being a magnificent specimen from which most of the flocks of the
State are recruited, and there are very few smooth-bodied animals now to be found in the
studs of any strain.
There is little agriculture outside the recognised wheat-belt. Beyond this line to the
west the country is practically given over entirely to the raising of merino wool; the cattle
grown in the State being chiefly raised on the Eastern Slopes of the Great Dividing Range and
on the Monaro tableland. The western pastoral country, the home of the merino sheep, is
traversed by the river Darling, which is navigable in good seasons from the Murray River,
of which it is a tributary, to Walgett. Bourke, a town on the Darling, about 500 miles north-
west of Sydney, is connected by rail with the Metropolis, and another railway runs north-west
to Moree, both trunks having several branch lines. The Western Division is watered by the
Gwydir, Namoi, Castlereagh, Macquarie, and Bogan, in addition to the Darling. The country
is all open plains, beautifully grassed in seasons of good rainfall. Some of the homesteads
dotted over this vast expanse of pastoral country are veritable mansions, and it is here that
true Australian hospitality finds its highest expression. No traveller through the pastoral
country thinks of making his stay at public-houses. He drives to the nearest station home-
stead at the end of his day’s journey, and, though he is a complete stranger, his horses are cared
for and he is made free of the best accommodation in the house.


On the best improved stations —as sheep-runs are called—extremely
comfortable quarters are provided for all the employees. The sheep are

fences, the boundary being in all probability rabbit-proof. The sheep are worked in separate
lots. Lambing ewes are kept together, and after weaning the weaners are put on the best
feed. The young wethers are also kept on good feed, and as many as possible are fattened
off. The practice is to cull the flocks every year, thus keeping the best, and constantly
improving the average wool capacity. Many stations have stud flocks and breed rams for
their flocks, introducing fresh blood from time to time. A station carrying 50,000 to 100,000
sheep employs from forty to fifty men all the year round, the wages being to competent hands
£1 per week and rations, and a cook is provided, who draws all the rations through the station
storekeeper. The shearing is done by piece-work, £1 per 100, and when the sheep are shorn
the shearer packs his swag, mounts his horse or bicycle, and departs for another station.
WAITING TO BE SHORN,


A Golden
Period.
Wool has been at a high price all through the past season, and the period
has been a golden one for pastoralists. With increasing flocks, good seasons,
and high prices the outlook has been particularly bright. The sheep is
described by a recent expert writer as being a most reliable animal for
profit. “ Kept in any good district,” says this writer, “ and managed with a moderate degree
of intelligence, it fairly spins money for the pastoralist. The wool market is absolutely
sound, and Australian wool fetches the cream of the prices whether it be sold in Sydney,
London, or Antwerp. Of all animals the sheep is the easiest to manage, and the occupation
of the sheep-raiser is the easiest and pleasantest imaginable. The station-holder and station
manager pass through their anxious periods, but the shearing comes round, the gleaming white
staple is rolled into the bales, and the golden sovereigns which it must realise are assured. A
flock which cuts an average of 8 lb. of wool per sheep is worth about 6s. per head to the grower
at the present prices, and the increase is very valuable.”
SHEARING BOARD,


As wool is now being grown increasingly by small holders it may be as
well to mention that the system of transportation and sale in New South
Wales is so comprehensive and equitable that the small farmer with his few
bales gets just the same treatment as the man who shears 100,000 sheep.

The wool clip of New South Wales is, as previously stated, its most
important item of production, and it may be said that the prosperity of the
State in a large measure depends upon the wool market. In 1902 the clip
was worth £7,353,707 ; in 1903, £8,593,150 ; in 1904, £9,274,387 ; and in

1905, £10,040,000, while pastoral products generally in this year were valued at £16,500,000.
With an average export of 250,000,000 lb. a rise of Id. per lb. in the market price of wool means
an addition of £1,041,000 to the wealth of the people of the State. A striking instance of the
influence of a fluctuation in price is afforded by the figures for 1898 and 1899 ; in the earlier
year the production was greater by upwards of 37,000,000 lb., while the value was £1,700,000
less. The average weight of the fleece during the past four years has been about 7£ lb. Of
late years there has been a marked improvement in this direction, and a remarkable proof of
this fact is afforded by a comparison of the figures relating to the periods ending with 1890
and 1904. In the earlier year the sheep numbered 14,800,000 more, yet the average annual
production of wool was only 8,000,000 lb. in excess of that of the later period, the decrease
in the number of sheep during the interval being 31'2 per cent., and in the volume of wool
31 per cent. At one time almost all the wool was shipped on the grower’s account and sold
in London, but of late years fully 80 per cent, has been sold in the local markets, as purchasers
have realised the advantage of buying on the spot.
Apart from the wool, there is the local and export mutton trade for the sheep-grower
to think of. The demand for sheep for local consumption was, until recent years, so small
that it did not appreciably affect the increase of the flocks of the State. This, however, is

Trade.
not now the case. The annual demand for food consumption within the
State is about 6'5 per cent, of the number of sheep depastured—equal to about
three-fifths of the cast. By “cast” is meant the number at the age when it
would be more profitable to send them for slaughter than to keep them, in the
case of ewes for breeding, or for further growth in the case of non-breeders. The cast, expressed
as a percentage of the whole of the sheep depastured is a variable quantity, which, however,
may be taken as about 11 £ per cent. The number slaughtered for export in a frozen or pre-
served state, and for tallow, brings up the total slaughtered to about 8 - 5 per cent, of the entire
flocks. The requirements of the mutton trade have demanded an improvement on the carcase
of the merino sheep, and this has led to the introduction and crossing with the merino of a
number of English breeds. These sheep do better nearer the coast than the merino, and they
are coming into favour with the holder who devotes his attention partially to agriculture and
partly to sheep-raising. The climate of the Eastern Seaboard for a considerable distance
inland is too moist, and a large portion of the country too poor, for the adequate sustenance
of merinoes, but it is probable that the coarser breeds of sheep would not deteriorate through

where the soil is very rich, dairy-farming

doubt, the most profitable industries. Sheep-

up a regular supply of first-class crossbred mutton and lamb, has secured a high-class trade, and
the lambs sent from Australia last season were considered equal to those of New Zealand.
The number of sheep for cross breeding in this State is fast increasing, and as the demand in
England, South Africa, and the East is constantly growing, there is every reason to be con-
fident about the future of the capacity of the export trade to absorb the surplus fat stock at
a figure profitable to the grower. In 1904 there were exported from New South M ales 34,500
quarters of frozen or chilled beef, and 570,934 carcases of mutton, of a total value of £290,065,
together with 8,136,8731 b. of preserved meat, valued at £135,073. In addition to the export
of frozen beef and mutton there has grown up within the past few years a considerable trade
in frozen rabbits and hares. In the State itself these animals now form a common article of
diet, and a large number of persons are engaged in their capture and distribution. In addition
to the carcases, the skins of the animals are also exported in considerable quantities. There
are other pastoral products and by-products in which a considerable trade is done, such as
tallow, edible fat and lard, skins and hides, furs, horns, hoofs, bones, and hair.
There are two branches of cattle-raising carried on in the State —beef
and dairying. The dairy cattle are dealt with in the chapter relating to
that industry. Exclusive of dairy stock there are about 1,500,000 head of

cattle in the State. The Shorthorn predominates, the breed principally used for crossing with
this breed being the Hereford, but the Black-polled Angus has been coming into favour of
late years. The glorious climate of New South Wales is so congenial that very little housing
of stock is necessary, even in stud herds. The best of the stud bulls are housed at night as




a rule, and allowed to run in paddocks in the day-time. The cows, however, are scarcely ever
housed, except in the coldest portions of the highlands. The breed of cattle throughout the
State is steadily improving—a result due to the introduction of good stud stock, to greater
care and attention exercised in selection and breeding, more particularly for dairying purposes,
and to culling and keeping in paddocks. In order to encourage and assist dairy farmers in
improving the breed of their cattle, the Government of the State imported some high-class
stud bulls from England, which may be leased for a short period at a small fee. There are now
twenty-five of these bulls, distributed amongst the chief centres of the dairying industrv.
During the year 1904, 440 pure-bred cattle were imported, chiefly from the other States of
the Commonwealth. Importations from Europe and America were prohibited for many years,
owing to the natural dread of the stockowners that their herds should contract diseases which
have devastated the cattle of other countries. The prohibition was removed in 1888, and
cattle are now admitted after strict quarantine. The number so admitted in 1904, included
in the above figures, was twenty-six—ten bulls and sixteen cows. The breeding cows in 1904
numbered 592,000, and as there were 367,232 calves branded, the average calving was about
62 per cent., which may be regarded as very satisfactory. There is a great market for beef
cattle almost at our doors—in the East. It is a market capable of considerable expansion,
so that there is not much likelihood of the New South Wales beef-growers being able to overtake
the demand.

steadily increased from 1883 to 1894, when it stood at 518,181. Since then the number has
fluctuated. A large number of horses were taken from New South Wales to South Africa
during the Boer war, and recently the Japanese have been large buyers. The trade with India
is a constant one of many years standing. In 1896 the number of horses in the State was
510,636, in 1897 498,034, in 1898 491,553, and in 1904 482,663.

It is the possession of these qualities which gives them their great value as army remounts.
In 1904 the number of horses exported to countries outside Australasia was 3,281, valued at
£76,011.
As stated in previous chapters, the stock in New South Wales are remark-
ably healthy, sheep being practically free from disease. The chief diseases
recorded during the last ten years are anthrax, footrot, fluke, worms, and the
black disease. Scab has been unknown for many years. The mortality from

anthrax was considerable until M. Pasteur’s system of vaccination was introduced. The first
operations were rather unsatisfactory ; but in the following year they were quite successful.
Such is the general belief in the efficacy of the treatment that over 1,000,000 sheep are now
vaccinated annually, as a preventive measure against the disease.
The diseases most prevalent amongst cattle are pleuro-pneumonia, Cumberland disease
(anthrax), black leg (symptomatic anthrax), tuberculosis, cancer, actinomycosis, red-water,
and ophthalmia. About 5£ per cent, of the stock on 102 holdings were affected by pleuro-
pneumonia in 1904:. Inoculation has been practised with good results. For each of the five
years ended with 1904 the losses from tuberculosis were 3,850. Of other diseases, cancer and
actinomycosis cause the most deaths, the average loss through these diseases being over 1,600
in each of the last five years, while in the same period Cumberland disease was responsible


for 450 deaths annually, blackleg 1,130, ophthalmia 500, and red-water 70. Australian cattle,
probably because they live in a more natural stat than those of other countries, are, on the
whole, remarkably free from milk-fever and other complaints attendant on calving.
Very little disease amongst horses is known in New South Wales. During the past
ten years anthrax has never been reported from more than two or three districts, and in some
years has been practically unknown. Australian stringhalt—considered to be due to intestinal
parasites—is somewhat more common, while cases of mange, influenza, ringworm, and strangles
also occur. Glanders has been practically unknown for years, but cases of ophthalmia and
blindness have been reported.
So far as noxious animals are concerned, the only one of consequence is
the rabbit; and while the pastoralist earnestly desires the destruction of
this animal, it is not without its champions, as a most profitable trade in
exporting frozen rabbits and hares to England has been built up, while the

skins are also of considerable value. But the damage done by the rabbit to the sheep pastures
is most serious, and organised and persistent attempts are made to eliminate this drawback
to the success of the pastoralist’s operations. The chief methods of checking the spread of
the rabbits in use are fencing with wire-netting, clearing the land of shelter, trapping, poisoning,
and driving. The State has erected 1,330 miles of rabbit-proof fencing, and private owners
have constructed 42,797 miles ; the total cost of these fences being £2,295,222. An experiment
is projected to test the power of an infectious disease to exterminate the rabbits. The experi-
ment is to be carried out on an island off the coast of New South Wales by Dr. Uanysz, of the
Pasteur Institute.
No article on the pastoral industry would be complete without a reference
to the artesian water-bearing belt, which extends across the greater portion
of the northern part of the State. This water imprisoned in the tertiary
drifts and cretaceous beds under the northern plains is of immense value.
The Artesian
Water.
Anywhere on the water-bearing area a good supply may be obtained by sinking a bore, and
the water when tapped rises to the surface, and frequently spouts many feet into the air above
the pipe. The water was first discovered in 1879 at a depth of 140 feet, on the Kallara run.
TEAMS ON THE ROAD.


and since 1884 the sinking of
artesian bores has proceeded
in a scientific and systematic
manner, under the direction of
specially-trained officers. The
deepest bore completed is that
at Dolgelly, on the road from
Moree to Boggabilla, where
boring has been carried to a
depth of 4,086 feet; this well
yields a supply of approxi-
mately 682,000 gallons pet-
day. The largest flow ob-
tained from Government bores
is from the Kenmare, on the
road from Bourke to Hunger-
ford ; the depth of this well is

1,539 feet, and the estimated flow about 2,050,000 gallons per day. The flowing bores
sunk by the Government yield over 30,000,000 gallons of water per day, and in addition
there are pumping bores, which yield 500,000 gallons per day. Watering places are estab-
lished on all the main stock routes of the State,* and consist of tanks, dams, wells, and
artesian bores. At the present time there are 295 tanks, 34 dams or reservoirs, 77 wells, and
67 artesian bores. The tanks have a capacity of up to 5,000,000 gallons, and in depth they
range up to 20 feet. The supply for the 67 Government artesian bores on the various stock
routes of the State is approximately 30,000,000 gallons per day. The Artesian Wells Act
of 1897 provides that any occupier of land, or any group of occupiers, may petition the Minister
to construct an artesian well and the necessary distributing channels for water. The petitioners
are required to pay such charges as may be assessed by the Land Board, w'hich shall not exceed
the yearly value to each occupier of the direct benefit accruing to his land from the construction
of the bore, and the supply of water from the same ; but such charges cannot exceed 6 per
cent, per annum on the cost of the works. Much has been done in the way of artesian boring
by private enterprise. As far as can be ascertained, 259 private bores have been undertaken
in New South Wales, of which twenty-two w r ere failures, and twelve are in progress. Several
of the bores have a flow of over 4,000,000 gallons per day, while the total daily flow is about
150,000,000 gallons.

industry which is fast assuming important proportions. The Angora has

genitors of the present flocks having been introduced as far back as 1833. A great advantage
in connection with the goat is that it will thrive in poor country that is practically useless for


other purpose, and pasturing goats on pooT scrubby country has a vastly improving effect
upon it. Within recent years a good deal of attention has been paid to the breeding of Angoras,
and a considerable number of pure-bred bucks and does have been obtained from the United
States. In the early part of the present year large purchases of pure-bred goats were made by
breeders of this State in Adelaide, and in consequence our flocks received such an accession of
strength that the seat of the Australian mohair industry has now been firmly located in New
South Wales. Mohair and goat skins, like wool and wheat, are commodities in demand all the
world over ; their price, therefore, does not depend upon local requirements alone, and the
promoters of the industry look with confidence to its future. There are, at present, about
35.000 head of goats in New South Wales ; and while it does not appear probable that the
industry is one that will rival sheep-farming, there is reason to believe that, with a climate so
eminently suited to the production of the finest mohair, the export of this product will, before
long, become an important feature in the commerce of the State.

CHAPTER XXII.
Poultry-breeding for Farmers.
BY G. BRADSHAW.
i(Sa = p=j] HE purpose of this paper being to supply reliable infor-
mation on poultry-breeding to settlers, immigrants,
and strangers from other lands, a departure is
made from the customary manner in which this
j 7 . evergreen subject is treated.
Poultry farms, devoted to poultry only,
obtain but to a small extent in any part of the
world. The £10,000,000 worth of poultry carcase
and eggs which annually reach England are pro-
duced in small quantities by large numbers of the peasant proprietors of France, by the
peasantry of Russia, and by farm labourers, artisans, and cottagers of other Continental countries.
Even the large poultry plants in America do not contribute to the export poultry trade of that
country, their products being used largely for the supply of pure eggs for hatching, or the pro-
duction of broilers —eight to ten weeks old chickens—which are largely used in the hotels in
America. The large poultry-tinning plants and frozen export poultry trade done by Armour
and other similar concerns are chiefly supplied by consignments from the farms and the small
but numerous breeders of the United States. Even the large poultry farms which do exist
are, according to a leading American paper, under a gradual evolution, as the following editorial,
lately printed, will show :
“ Consideration of conditions leads us to take notice of the gradual evolution of the
poultry industry. Hitherto the ideal of those looking for profits from fowls has been the
exclusive poultry plant, and a great many plants have been established which the projectors
fondly hoped would develop that ideal, and make fortunes for their proprietors. Such efforts
have been but partially successful -indeed, too exceptional to be used as illustrations—and
of late years we have seen a general breakaway from these methods, and often another abandon-
ment of large exclusive poultry plants, and fortunately, on the other hand, a general awakening
of interest in poultry among the farmers. In this evident increasing interest of farmers in
poultry culture, we find the solution of the question of supplying the growing demand for poultry
products. The farmers of the country can produce more poultry, and better poultry, and
through them will come the evolution of the poultry industry in this country.”


All sorts of inducements may be held out to immigrants to New South
Wales to part with their few pounds or hundreds. Agents will show them
profits from poultry farming, and offer a choice of many bargains. Adver-
tisements in the daily papers will appeal to them, and the suburban poultry
farmer will view the time of arrival of the immigrant as that best suited to

dispose of his “ well-stocked profitable farm,” Should any of these propositions be accepted,
the transactions may be legitimate enough, but my advice to the new-comer would be, “ Do
not attempt to make a living out of exclusive suburban poultry farming.”
After allowing for all the legitimate expenses, plant, capital, stock, labour, freights,
commissions, fatalities, &c., there is a fair profit to be made, but certainly not sufficient to
warrant anyone going into poultry farming with the intention that he can pay rent, purchase
food, do all cartage, pay railage and commissions, and have sufficient left to keep his

wife and family. Such poultry farming does not obtain in other countries because it does
not pay, or because other occupations or industries pay better, and it is much less likely to
pay under Australian conditions, which frequently affects the food bill to at least 1(X) per
cent, above the normal. A forcible illustration of this is in evidence at the'time of writing.
Wheat is quoted at 3s. 9d. per bushel, while the offal from this same wheat—pollard—is Is. fid.
per bushel of 20 lb. In other words, 60 lb. of the best wheat is obtainable at the above figure,
the same weight of pollard costing 4s. fid. In other countries, the price of wheat always
regulates that of its offal —bran and pollard —which are, both in England and America, about
half the price of the cereal from which they are obtained. I have no faith in poultry farming
as a sole industry, and will again urge all immigrants or new arrivals to avoid being cajoled
into investing their money in such ventures.

mediate suburbs of Sydney,

of orchardists, market gardeners, artisans, and
suburban residents who make poultry keeping a
profitable adjunct issue to their other operations,
but none have such opportunities and facilities
for doing well with fowls as have the settlers
on the soil. Whether the locality and other
SILVER-LACED WYANDOTTES.
conditions favour wheat, maize, oats, or barley and potatoes, or a rotation of crops, dairying or
other agricultural operations, the farmer is in a position to make poultry-keeping, not only pay,
but pay handsomely; indeed, of the entire community who keep fowls, none have the elements
necessary for the well-being and profit-making of poultry as have the farmers of this State.
The suburban breeder has to purchase dearly, or pay a high rent for his few acres and
cottage, purchase everything the fowls eat, and otherwise conduct his operations under dis-
couraging conditions. The man on the land, on the other hand, has every essential at command
to make this auxiliary a success. There is actually no rent to pay for the fowls, the housing
can be of the simplest kind, the material being all obtainable on any ordinary holding, while
if cereals are grown there is always a quantity of light grain which can be most profitably fed
to fowls; and the fact that the fowls, running free, have access to seeds and weeds, further reduces
the feed bill. By running in a paddock the fowls obtain worms, slugs, grasshoppers, and other
insect life which contribute largely to increased egg production. Again, there is no charge
for labour, while the poultry products can be carted to rail with other produce of the farm.
Poultry at liberty on a farm have an ideal life, and if a beginning be made with healthy vigorous
stock, and the minimum of attention in the way of plain food, cool clean drinking water, and
airy roosting quarters is given, there need be no fear of disease. The agriculturist of all others
is the one who should be able to make the keeping of fowls a profitable industry. He has the
labour in his own family, free land for the fowls,
and food at the minimum of cost, the only out-
lay being a few pounds for the initial cost of
stock.
I am quite aware of the fact
that in this as in other Aus-
tralian States the only market
for poultry products is in the

sufficient even moderate quality goods to supply their shop trade demands, a dozen plump
4| lb. weight chickens being unobtainable at any sales, and when a few of fair quality appear,
from 6s. to 7s. per pair is usually realised. After January the quantity increases, and the
(juality also improves: but, unfortunately, from the beginning of the year, and for many months,
the demand for good quality is so meagre that the breeder of choice chickens to put on the
market at this period frequently does so at a loss, and gets discouraged.

Months.
However, I have shown that the food handicap will scarcely apply to the
farmer, the light grains being kept for this purpose, and by breeding only
for the few months when prices are not only good but considerably better
than that obtainable for the same quality in England, he should do well.
The farmer arriving here will also find some advantages which do not obtain in the
land he has left, one being that wherever a railway station is to be found in the State, the
Railwav Commissioners, on a request from the producer, supplies him with coops free of charge
in which to carry his fowls to Sydney. These coops are large and airy, and of a design calculated
to ensure safe delivery at the Sydney sale-room. The following are the rates charged by the
Commissioners :
From this it will be seen that a settler on Myall Creek Estate can, from the furthest of the three
railway stations —Mount Russell, 492 miles, —have his coop of twelve pairs of fowls or ducks con-
veyed to Sydney for 9s. 6d., or 9id. per pair, a mere trifle in comparison with the enumerated
advantages, At the same time it must be borne in mind that I only advocate the Sydney markets

within the four or five months mentioned, for the prices in the other periods of the year are
scarcely payable. But should the proprietor lay himself out to cater for the good trade by
supplying plump young fowls of from 3$ lb. to 4 lb. weight, he can calculate on a net return
of ss. per pair, for at least four months of the year. Appended are the average monthly prices
for ordinary poultry for the years 1900 and 1904, the encouraging feature being that the mean
prices for fowls in the latter year was lOd. per pair more than in 1900. Ducks also considerably
improved in price, while geese averaged 6s. a pair as against ss. sd. four years ago ; turkeys
realised from 11s. up to 20s. 9d. per pair ;
The above are the average prices and they have no bearing upon the 6s. and 7s. per
pair for prime quality fowls previously quoted.
In order to secure, say, 100 cockerels for the Sydney markets during the

performers of the very worst type. Hens must never be kept after their second year’s laying,
as after that they are not profitable. This obliges the farmer to continue breeding operations
each year, marketing the cockerels, and after the second season drafting the two-year old
hens to market to make room for the younger ones to fill their places.
Concerning the marketing of the eggs, the Railway Commissioners, as with poultry,
come to the producers aid. They carry
eggs at half the ordinary rates to the
Sydney markets, and convey the empty
returns from Sydney to the remotest rail-
way station free of cost. Further than
this, as the greatest quantity of eggs will
be produced in spring. when the ruling
price of sd. or fid. per dozen is unre-
munerative, the Agricultural Department
comes to the poultry farmer's aid by pro-
viding cold storage, where the eggs can

dozen case of eggs is carried on the Government railways at the following rates : —Up to 100
miles, Is. ; to 200, Is. 9d.; to 300 miles, 2s. 3d.; to 400 miles, 2s. fid,; to 500 miles, 2s. 9d. A
resident in the State 500 miles from Sydney can have his case of eggs conveyed to Sydney for
three farthings a dozen —an amount which, so far as expense is concerned, places him on an
equality with those in the remote Sydney suburbs.
The new comer from other countries will, no doubt, experience some diffi-
culty with the various egg quotations of the daily papers, “Norths,” “Souths,”
“Railway,” “New Laids,” and at some seasons “Cold-room,“ all being quoted.
What are known as New Laids are from the suburban poultry farmers, orchard-

ists, and others, who bring in a few dozen each sale day. These are rarely more than one week
old. They embrace small lots of from three to ten or twenty dozen, and are usually purchased
by boarding-house keepers, and grocers who have a special trade for the best goods. They
bring Id. to Hd. per dozen more than any others offered. “Railways,” as the name indicates,
come by rail, mostly from farmers along the railway route. These are usually of good quality,
and come next to new laids in price. Following these are “ Souths” or South Coast. These
come from the various ports of call south of Sydney, beginning at Wollongong and extending
to Eden. “Norths” or Northern Rivers, come not only from the North Coast, but in some
instances a 100 miles or more away up the extreme reaches of Northern Rivers —The Tweed,
Clarence, Richmond and others.
In the winter season, not more than 2d. per dozen separates these from the suburban
article, but in the hot weather they range as much as Id. below. The “Cold-room” eggs are

He who purposes breeding fowls for profit need give little heed to
breeds beyond Orpingtons and Wyandottes. Leghorns certainly will lay
excellently, and are small feeders, and did every egg produce a pullet
they might be recommended, as there would not then be any small
cockerels to market. Langshans are also good layers, and make at a late

ing blacks as my recommendation to the immigrants, farmers, and other settlers on the land ;
and should any of these people fail to make poultry-breeding pay, they can rest assured that the
breed is not at fault. As egg producers, the Hawkesbury College 1904-5 competition showed that
108 Black Orpingtons produced an average of 159 eggs each for the twelve months, the same


number of Silver Wyandottes having 145 each to their credit. At the Dookie (Victoria) College
competition, six Black Orpingtons secured third place with 1,228, these being bred in Wagga,
in this State. The same breed secured fifth place at the Hawkesbury College contest with the
good record of 1,155, and were bred at Gosford, showing that environment affects them but
little ; while at the previous College contest, out of seventy lots, Black Orpingtons secured
second position with 1,274 eggs for the six hens. These results show that, whether taken collec-
tively as a breed, or as strains, the records conclusively show that they hold a superior position
as egg producers. Further, however good the above records be, they are likely to be exceeded
in the present year, 1906, at a contest being held on the farm of Mr. J. Mclntosh, Rockdale.
The place is a hot sand bed. Still Black Orpingtons occupy the highest position of the competing
fifty pens. Six hens have laid in eight months the extraordinary number of 152 eggs each,
and are closely followed by another six which have laid slightly over 148 eggs each, several
others of the same breed closely following.
In speaking of this breed as a table fowl, I will content myself with quoting
the following letter from Mr. C. E. Brook, poultry salesman, London, relative
to a number of Orpington chickens exported some years ago :
The Table Bird.
“ The chickens, ex ‘Australasian,’ made 4s. each, and were very fine. Only get them
here earlier and any quantity can be sold at from 4s. to ss. each with no difficulty. They are
the finest frozen chickens that came to our market,
and the way they have been killed, dressed, and pre-
pared is deserving of every praise. Although there
have been large quantities of Canadian, Russian,
Hungarian, and other varieties, there is no comparison
between them and the chickens that come to us from
Australia. I hope you will be able to get us large
supplies for the forthcoming season.” The chickens
referred to were shipped by Messrs. Boyd of Gosford,
Gray of Paterson, and Hoffman of Parramatta.
Nothing has been said in this article about
hatching and rearing. This is an extremely simple
process, and I feel sure, whether the immigrants be
experienced agriculturists or farm labourers, they
will be acquainted with the way to set a hen ; nor
is there any mystery in rearing chickens, the simple

CHAPTER XXIII.
Bee-keeping
As an Aid to Settlement on Mountain Lands.
BY W. HESSEL HALL, M.A.
NE of the most valuable assets of any State is to be found
MM \\ in its mountain lands, and in the hardy and healthy
■ JL men and women that they nourish. In New South
Wales this class of country has been undervalued by
uHV settlers in the past, and still remains in the hands of
the State. These broken lands extend in a broad belt
running north and south right through the State, with
an elevation varying from a few hundred feet on the
foothills to several thousand feet on the higher ranges.
Included in this area is a considerable extent of table-
land with an English climate—the richer portions of which are already occupied by settlers
engaged in farming and pastoral pursuits; but the immense extent of broken country embraced
in the mountain area is practically unoccupied.
Extending from about 30 miles, and often less, from the eastern seaboard
to the edge of the western plains, the whole of this area lies within the rain
belt of the State, with an average annual rainfall varying from 26 inches on

the eastern and western foothills to 60 inches on some of the higher parts.
The soil varies from rich volcanic in parts, covered with dense semi-tropical
vegetation, to poor shales and sandstones (overlying the Coal Measures),
that require a close industry to yield a subsistence by ordinary methods of

cultivation. At the same time even the poorest tracts contain innumerable sites where a home
may be made and a family reared, within easy distance of the seaboard, and amidst the whole-
somest, healthiest, and most independent conditions to be found anywhere on earth ; provided
only that the settler is content with a simple way of living, and to produce mainly for the food
requirements of himself and family—relying on the sale of honey, timber, and in time on
fruit-growing and dried fruits, for the ready money to procure the necessaries and small luxuries
which he cannot produce for himself.


The whole of the mountainous region above described, together with
isolated patches on the seaboard, and in various other parts of the State,
is clothed with the native forest and indigenous undergrowth—these so far
as the near future is concerned constitute its real wealth. Even the barrenest

patches in the sandstone region—where the surface often consists of raw sand and rock —are
densely covered with the various eucalypts and with innumerable wild flowering shrubs, mainly
wattles and other leguminous plants, which being able to obtain their nitrogen from the air
will grow and enrich the soil as they decay in spots where other vegetation unaided could not
exist. With the value of many of these timbers, except for the settler’s use for fuel, fencing,
and building, this chapter is not specially concerned, though it may be remarked by the way
that the procuring of timber from adjacent forest reserves for railway, building, and export
purposes may well add to the settler’s income from his own holding.
Those not familiar with this region can form no conception of the enormous
quantities of honey produced by the native forest trees and flowering shrubs
every year. Occasionally the yield takes the form of “ manna,” the honey
or sweet sap exuding from small punctures made in the bark of the trees

tongue with which they brush the honey out of the flower-cups. When the mountain forests
are white with bloom, enormous flocks of shrieking parrakeets fly from tree to tree, revelling
in the liberal supply of nectar, and deafening the ears of the passer-by with their din.
English bees that have gone wild in the bush are now plentiful, and from their nests in hollow
trees the settler may obtain a good deal of the stock necessary to start an apiary. But
during the great honey flows which come almost every year, and sometimes many times in
one year, the honey supply is so abundant, that much of it, even now, must needs go to

apiary, last season, brought in two tons of surplus honey in a little over a week, while for a
short time mauv more colonies might have done equally well. To take advantage of these
abundant flows the art of the bee-keeper must be directed to having his colonies full of bees
ready for work just at the right time.
Among the honey-producing trees of Australia the eucalyptus family
easily takes first place, both in respect to the number of species and to the
quality of the honey produced. The somewhat prevalent opinion in the
Old World that honey from the eucalypti is inferior and has a eucalyptus

experience, has found them all palatable and good, provided that they are properly ripened.
The presence of so many sources of supply would lead the uninitiated to
suppose that the honey obtained would be a hopeless mixture of all sorts ;
this, however, is not the case. The various trees have their set times for
coming into bloom, different varieties blooming at intervals right throughout
Types of
Honey.
the year. The honey from those that bloom in the winter and spring is mainly consumed
by the bees themselves in the rearing of the spring broods, before swarming time. The great
bulk of the surplus honey obtained comes from a comparatively small number of varieties.
During the big summer and autumn honey-flows, with a little care on the part of the
bee-keeper, the main yields can be extracted separately at the conclusion of each flow, and
kept apart. In the case where two or more varieties are in bloom at the same time, if the
honeys are of the same colour and type, they may be taken together. In the case where a
flow from an inferior and a superior variety is on at the same time it will be found that the
bees themselves do not mix the honeys, but that separate colonies gather from separate sources.
If the bee-keeper will take the trouble to extract from the hives working on each kind separately
he may still keep the good quality apart, otherwise the whole extraction must be graded as
second-class honey. To prevent confusion each class of honey should be marketed under the
name of the tree or trees from which it is produced.
Where the sources of honey supply are so numerous, it would be out of the
question to attempt to describe every honey-producing tree in the mountain
area, but a description of a few, the most widely-distributed and typical
trees, and their honey product, may be attempted. Among the most impor-
tant are the box family, found chiefly on the western slopes and plains. Of
Some Typical
Honey-pro-
ducing Trees.
these the white and yellow box are the most important, though, strictly speaking, they
scarcely belong to the mountain timbers


White Box (E. Bosistoana). —The honey from the white box is water-white in colour,
clear and limpid, with the Havour characteristic of the box family in its most delicate form.
The honey from this tree is always sure of a market in Australia. Unlike nearly all pure
honeys it does not readily granulate. This peculiarity makes it popular with the bottling
firms, as it seldom requires to be melted before being bottled.
Yellow Box (E. melliodora). —The honey from the yellow box has the characteristic
palatable Havour common to all the box family. In colour it is a rich golden tint. Like
the white box honey it retains the liquid form for a considerable time, and is in every way
equal to it.
Red Bloodwood (E. corymbosa). —This is one of the most widely-distributed and
valuable of the mountain honey-producing trees. It blooms in the autumn, in February and
APPLE-TREE.


March, but not every year. Its habit is a general bloom one year, then a year of rest to
mature its seed, then a year of light bloom, followed by the year of general bloom again. The
large white flowers are carried in thick bunches on the tops of the branches. In the year of
general bloom the trees are a beautiful sight, the mountains for miles appearing one mass of
white-topped trees, while the air is laden with the rich honey perfume, and full of the din of the
parrots and the steady roar of millions of excited bees tumbling over each other in their eagerness
to gather the rich stores. When the weather conditions are favourable to honey secretion
the honey flow becomes a honey flood. The bee-keeper, with every nerve a-quiver, must take
up the pace set by the bees ; must tier up the hives three and four and five storeys high, till
four strong men could barely lift a single hive even a few inches for weight of honey ; must
work feverishly at the extractor to empty the combs and get them back to the hives for a further
supply, till the roar of the bees and the whirl of the extractor get on his nerves and he longs
for the comparative silence of night. But even at night the apiary is filled with a roar like
that of a train rushing through a mountain cutting—the sound of millions of fanning wings
driving the air currents through the hives to evaporate the surplus moisture from the nectar
and turn it into rich ripe honey.
The honey from the bloodwood is of a clear rich golden colour, thick, rich, and of excellent
flavour. If touched it will string out in long threads that will support the weight of a bee
to the ground. Unlike the “ box ” honey it granulates almost at once after extraction into
a creamy white crystal, nicer than the nicest of lollies, and can be eaten by the handful.
If melted for bottling it will keep liquid for about six weeks and then granulate again. In
districts where “ Angophora intermedia ” is not present the bloodwood honey is obtained
uncontaminated by inferior sorts, and is suitable for export as its flavour appears to suit the
English palate. Owing to its hard candying habit it is also particularly suitable for sale (candied)

Moreover, it is one of the trees that occasionally yield manna honey, which appears to be very
similar to the honey obtained from the blooms. On trees near his home the writer has observed
the bees gathering from the cicada punctures, and on swarming up the trees to examine has
found the flowing sap to be sweetish in taste. In one case in a gully behind his house he has
seen the ground under the grey gum covered with the little white lumps of crystallised manna,
as described earlier in this chapter. Things hum along pretty fast in the apiary when grey
gum is in bloom.
Sydney Peppermint (E. piperita).—This tree is very common on the sandstone country,
growing freely on the most rocky and barren spots. It blooms in December, producing
considerable quantities of excellent honey, which speedily candies hard to a watery white
crystal. The honey belongs to the golden class, is mild in flavour, and is suitable for tabic
or export.
Grey Ironbark (E. paniculate).—This is a widely distributed tree very valuable for its
bark and timber. It blooms every other year in the spring, and the honey it yields is
invaluable in building up the colonies just before swarming time, besides giving considerable
surplus. In colour the honey is a brilliant golden hue. It candies speedily into firm bright
yellow crystals ; the flavour is excellent. In appearance the honey resembles that from the
orange blossom, but it is not so rich in flavour. In the writer’s apiary, which overlooks an
orange-growing district, the two honeys often come in at the same time, and as they go very


well together, the milder ironbark honey toning down the excessive richness of the orange blossom
flavour, it is his practice to harvest them together.
White Stnngyhark (E. eugenioides).—This tree is an excellent honey producer, but
is most erratic in its habit of blooming, sometimes blooming two years or more in succession,
and sometimes missing for several years together. Another peculiarity is that sometimes the
trees flower together, but more often drop in one after the other for several months at a time,
while the season for bloom varies from midwinter to mid-summer, thus enabling the bees to
secure most of the honey that is secreted. The honey is mild and palatable. It belongs to the
golden class, but with a slightly greenish tinge. Unlike nearly all mountain-produced honey,
and indeed nearly all pure honeys, it does not readily candy, but retains its liquid form from
season to season. The honey from this tree sells readily in the local market, being readily
purchased for bottling owing to its good general quality and its non-granulating habit.
White Bloodwood (E. eximia). —This tree comes into bloom in October. The honey
is not of first quality, having a brownish tint and somewhat coarser flavour than the others
described. This fact, however, is of very little significance, as the tree blooms at swarming
time and nearly all the honey it produces is consumed by the bees in brood-rearing. It is
very valuable to the bee-keeper owing to the enormous quantities of rich pollen that it produces,

the abundant food causing the bees to breed enormously and to swarm heavily. If a swarming
strain is kept, the year of general bloom means busy times for the bee-keeper, and will drive
him nearly distracted (if he is short of capital) with the effort to provide homes for the enormous
swarms that are constantly being thrown off. A good White Bloodwood bloom puts the
colonies into splendid order to deal with flows of better-class honey later in the season.
Two members of the angophora or apple family may be described, as this family pro-
duces the bulk of the inferior honey which is often attributed to the eucalypts :

White Apple (Angophora subvelutina). —This is another very large-growing and
handsome tree. It yields an abundance of dark-red honey, with the burnt-sugar flavour,
coming into flower a little before Christmas ; in the year of its bloom it deteriorates a good
deal of honev from overlapping flows. The objectionable flavour is very much toned down
when largely admixed with other honeys, but the dark colour persists ; still, as it keeps liquid
fairlv well, it finds a fair sale as second-class honey. The honey from both the red and white
apple cause the bee-keeper a good deal of annoyance by reducing the grade of better qualities,
and he sometimes wishes the trees could be destroyed, but if honey has been scarce for a time,
and the colonies are short of stores, he is profoundly thankful to have it for the use of his bees.
Much of the honey that gluts the local market at times contains a large admixture from
various members of the apple family, and some satisfactory method of turning it to account
would be of great service to the bee-keeper. Cannot its use in the manufacture of vinegar
be extended ? Some of the very best vinegar the writer ever tasted was made in his


household from such honey (chiefly scraps washed out of honey tins) diluted with water till
a new laid egg would barely float, poured into stone jars and left to ferment and ripen for
two years, then bottled off for use. Cannot the sugar-refining companies discover some cheap
method of refining it, extracting sugar from it, or otherwise turning it to profitable account ?
A satisfactory solution of this problem would lead to an immense extension of the bee-keeping
industry.
In dealing with the problem of settling the mountain lands the possibilities
of honey-production are too important to be overlooked. One of the chief
difficulties to be faced is that the settler with plenty of capital prefers to
settle where the land is rich and will have a value for sale when improved.
As an aid to
Settlement.
Generally he does sell after a few years, and then cries out for more land, that he may
repeat the process, till no more good land is available. The man with small capital on the
other hand, especially in second-
class country, is apt to be starved
out before he can make his
holding productive enough to
supply him with a living. It is
to the man with small capital,
who wants land for a permanent
home, that bee-keeping offers a
helping hand, as it requires but
little capital, and brings in an
immediate money return from

bee-keeper finds the forest his storehouse and treasury before putting axe to tree ; while
the small area he needs for cultivation round his home can be cleared and improved at
leisure. The settlement of the mountain lands and bee-keeping must go hand-in-hand. In
open country the industry is precarious, but in the mountains the broken nature of the country,
and the need for the extensive timber reserves which State policy requires, prevent the danger
of the bees being deprived of their food by the extensive clearing and ringbarking that takes
place on the open country that is suitable for extensive farming and grazing pursuits. The
writer, with limited capital to start with, has made a modest living for the past ten years on
as rough and poor a patch of land as can be found in the mountain area ; by the help of his
bees gradually improving the land, and preparing the way for fruit-growing, so that he knows
from experience both the difficulties and the advantages of this class of settlement, and after


ten years of experience he would not change the free wholesome life for one on the richest land
on the plains—much less would he care to return to that of the city.
In order that settlement may be successful in the case of men of limited
capital, certain conditions are essential. The State must be satisfied to
find its gain in increased population, with its attendant advantages for
trade and for national defence. Instead of stripping the intending settler

Conditions.
of his small capital in the purchase of land, it must offer him inducements to settle by
granting him favourable terms that will give him a chance to make a home and a living.
As the supply of mountain land is abundant, a fair area should be provided for each holding.

cultivation—growing mainly for home use, and an area in time—when highly improved—
for fruit-culture, for apples, vines, small fruits, and for dried fruits. To afford the settler an
opportunity of establishing himself, the land may be a gift, or preferably should be given on
“ perpetual lease,” rent-free for say twenty years, and afterwards bearing rental at 4 per cent, on
its “ unimproved value,” which on this class of land would generally be a nominal thing.
Where a settler wants land for a home, and not to make money by trafficking in land, this
form of tenure is equal to freehold, securing to the settler as it does the ownership of improve-
ments and the right to subdivide and sell the whole or any part of his interest. And as this
class of settlement will produce very little revenue from taxation, it is just to the State and
no hardship to the settler, that after the lapse of the twenty years (time to rear a family) he
should pay the small unimproved rental value as a contribution towards the cost of governing
the country. In choosing the locations it will be necessary to plant the settlers on the ridges
R


and more favoured spots, while the gullies and rough portions may be set apart as permanent
timber reserves. Care should be taken to survey sites in suitable localities before settlement
is invited.
One other matter must not be overlooked. The State, in view of the
stagnant condition of the local honey market, must encourage the grading
of honeys, so that, with the increase of production, a steady supply of the
better types shall be available for export. Also, it must provide standard
Grading and

samples of these honeys for exhibition and sampling in outside markets, so that foreign
purchasers may be assured of steady supplies of standard types. At present, though we ha\ e
low prices and severe gluts of inferior honey, we cannot guarantee a steady supply of standard
quality. And even where good honey is sent abroad, if one type and flavour is sent one time
and a totally difierent type and flavour the next time, business becomes impossible. But by
having standard types (named after the source of supply) on exhibition (to taste as well as
to look at), the prejudice—largely groundless—against Australian honey may be broken down,
and the way opened for a permanent export that shall place the industry upon a solid basis,
and allow for indefinite expansion.
As a means of dealing with the large supplies of inferior honeys that glut the market,
relief may be sought in more careful methods of harvesting, and by encouraging the use of
lower-grade honeys as a fattening ration for all kinds of stock; while the bee-keepers
themselves mav do much by keeping the inferior honeys separate as far as possible, and
turning them into bees to gather better honey when good quality flows are on.
A description of the methods of modern bee-keeping cannot be attempted in the space
at the writer’s disposal, but a few hints may be of service to intending settlers, whose experience
and capital are limited.
The common practice is to choose a home and then try to keep bees upon
it. Such a plan often results in failure owing to the locality being unsuitable.
The sensible man who intends to succeed will choose the spot that suits the
bees, and then establish his home there. In choosing a location care must

apiaries already established. With such
vast areas of suitable forest country to
choose from this can easily be managed,
and is in the interest of the newcomer
himself, as he will find it hard to build up
his apiary in face of the competition of
the populous colonies of his neighbours.
An exception to this rule may be made
where several families for the sake of

APIARY, HAWKESBURY AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.
a ridge or level tract in the mountains—away from other apiaries—that is surrounded
on all sides by timber reserves and broken country not likely to be settled in the near
future. It is desirable that the settler should pick the home for himself and his bees where a
variety of good honey-producing trees are present, otherwise his bees may have a feast one
year and a famine the next, as the same tree does not blossom every year. As far as possible
the open countrv should be avoided, as such land is likely to be ringbarked and cleared by
other settlers engaged in farming and grazing, and without the native forest the bees will not
be able to find a living. If the home is made in a suitable locality, a well-managed apiary
of from 100 to 150 strong colonies should yield an annual surplus of from 4 to 10 tons of honey,
and about 100 lb. of wax beyond that required by the bee-keeper for use as foundation comb.
These figures are not the result of mere surmise, but are the outcome of a lengthy experience
on the part of the writer. Good honey from the mountain area is worth on an average
21d. per lb. wholesale, and should not be sold for less; but in years of glut should be exported
or stored at the apiary to be sold in years when the supply is less abundant. In the year
just ended (1905) the writer’s crop of about 6 tons (120 cases) realised £l5O gross, or about
£125 net. Of this amount, about 4 tons (80 cases) were sold in the local market, and 46
cases were sent to fill export orders from South Africa, the writer receiving 21d. per lb. in
Sydney without risk. The quality of the honey exported (consisting of 20 cases of white
stringybark honey and 20 cases from red bloodwood) was reported as having given satisfac-
tion on arrival in South Africa.
The intending settler will be risking failure if he attempts to earn a living at bee-
keeping without some knowledge of the habits of bees and the methods of work adopted in
modern bee-keeping. Such knowledge can be gamed in a few weeks from Root s A.B.C.

he can soon acquire it,

For the rest experience is the

success. As a word of warning,
the writer would say that the

It is quite true that an
expert can make one colony

SCENE ON COWAN CREEK.
the text-books teach, but the beginner is more likely to have lost one good colony and to have
six empty hives when he has finished with the experiment. The golden maxim is keep your
colonies strong and go slowly but surely.
Good stocks of bees in frame hives can usually be purchased in Australia
at £1 per hive, but the man who is not overstocked and is prospering will
not sell good Italian hives under double that money. Swarms of black bees
can usually be bought in the season at from 2s. 6d. to 7s. 6d., according to

size. Where possible it is well to buy swarms, as they carry no risk of disease. Colonies of
black bees with comb, in the common gin-case, are worth about ss. each. It is generally best
for the beginner to buy black bees, put them in frame hives, and afterwards Italianize them.
If bought in boxes with comb the bees may be drummed out, the combs (if healthy) cut out and
transferred into frames, placed in the new frame hives, and queen and bees shaken in with
them. When the colony has secured and mended up the combs and settled down, the queen
may be removed, and a good Italian queen introduced in her place. Good Italian queens,
either golden or preferably leather-coloured, may be bought—untested, ss. ; tested, 10s. ; select
tested breeding queens, 15s. each—from any of a number of reliable breeders in the State.
In forest country the settler can generally add considerably to his stock by cutting the
nests of black bees, gone wild, out of the hollow trees in which they have built, saving the pieces


of worker comb, and brood, and transferring them to frame hives along with the bees, and then
Italianizing as soon as they have settled down. For the rest a page out of the writer’s own
experience may best give the necessary information. First, knowing nothing of bees, he bought
one hive—wicked hybrids—near relatives of the wasp in temper. To learn how to handle
these fiends he bought “ Root’s A.B.C. of Bee-culture,” and soon learned a good deal about
bees. Several black swarms were given to him by friends. Next he purchased a good Italian
queen, and breeding young queens from her replaced the wicked hybrids and blacks When
he had seven strong colonies he removed to another district, taking his hives 200 miles by rail.
In the new district he bought a couple of stray swarms for a few shillings each, cut several nests
out of hollow trees, and despite the loss of many fine swarms at swarming time through inex-
perience and failure to cut the queen’s wings, in two years raised the total to thirty colonies.
Then removing to the barren stony ridge—then in a state of nature—on which his home now
stands, he trusted to the bees and to what he could grow on the stony land for a living for himself
wife, and four young children. Obtaining the best strains of leather-coloured Italian blood,
breeding, culling, selecting, he has now as fine a lot of thoroughbred queens and bees as can be
found anywhere. By dint of clearing, trenching, draining, manuring, and even sifting, the
barren hill has been turned into a most fertile garden. For years he made his own hives out
of the übiquitous kerosene case, till the labour of harvesting the increased yields left no
time for such work. So by ten years’ hard work—earning before he ate —he has built up a home
in which he is satisfied to end his days. The same opportunities, and much better, are open
to thousands of others, and if the State will
help, on the lines indicated in this chapter,
the struggle need not be so hard as it was
at first for the writer.
In concluding this chapter the writer
would say that he is not a Government
official, and has not written for hire. The
life is one that he has lived, and is living
still. He sought it rather than have his
freedom of speech on political and social
questions curtailed as in his former calling,
and for the sake of the moral and physical
health of his family. And he is writing in
hope of benefiting the State by helping to
solve the problem of settling the people

healthful life of the mountains. He who has a stout heart and possesses industry and grit
need not fear failure. He will not make a fortune, but room and work for every child, and a
home and a living he may have. As a reward he will live a life most varied and interesting—


too busy to be dull—the years will slip by. He will call no man master. He will have busy
times and times of leisure. In place of the monotony and confinement of city labour he will
have work most varied, according to the time of the year, —clearing, splitting, fencing,
building, with material from his own land, beginning, if need be, with a sheet of bark or
slab hut, and ending with as good a house as his skill or means can construct. Hive-
making, queen-rearing, uncapping, extracting, soldering, marketing, ploughing, or digging,
trenching, draining, planting, reaping, mowing, harvesting, pruning, grafting, budding, picking
fruit, packing; all these and others go to make up the life of the mountain home. Though
not rich, the settler, like the writer, may have many good things from his own labour—peas,
beans, pumpkins, marrows, cabbage, cauliflower, turnips, parsnips, and other vegetables from
his own garden in plenty. Honey and honey-comb in variety and abundance, milk, cream,
butter, eggs, and bacon of his own curing. From his few trees, peaches, plums, nectarines,
apricots, apples, passion-fruit, oranges —more than he can eat; strawberries and cream for all
till they can eat no more ; the choicest of grapes in abundance —things that the richest cannot
buy so fresh and good. His children growing up hardy, deep-chested, and innocent, taller and
stronger by far than their parents, may follow in their father’s steps, or in after time in other
callings rise to eminence in the land. To the men and women who fear God, seek knowledge,
and are patient in industry, all these things are possible “on the mountain lands.”
Editor’s Note. —As there is no officer in the Government Service at present who has had a
long practical acquaintance with bee-farming, Mr. Hall was asked to contribute a chapter for the
“Immigrants’ Guide” from his own successful experience. Though some parts of the article are
more allied to public land-policy than to bee-keeping, it has been felt to be unfair to impair
the force of Mr. Hall’s argument by eliminating them as irrelevant, and the whole is therefore
presented as the expression of opinion of a successful settler of more than ordinary intelligence.]

CHAPTER XXIV.
Subsidiary Industries,
And New Ones suitable to Local Conditions Imports that could be Locally Supplied.
BY W. S. CAMPBELL, F.L.S.,
DIKRCTOK OF AGRICULTURE.
| r T seems quite possible that many of the minor branches
of agriculture, that hitherto have been either wholly or
partially neglected, will, before long, be taken up
either alone oi in conjunction with other larger and
more generally known branches.
Doubtless some of these minor branches should
prove highly profitable if they be taken in hand
properly and with a will.
For instance, the cultivation of flax, both for fibre
and seed, has proved remunerative in some parts of Australia to the few growers who have taken
up its cultivation. In the early days of the Colony, Governor King encouraged the cultivation
of flax and the manufacture of linen, and his efforts met with success. In the year 1800, from
a small quantity of European flax-seed a sufficiency of fibre had been grown to make 279 yards
of fine and 367 A of coarse linen. Every woman who could spin was employed from October,
1800.
For some unknown reason the cultivation of this valuable plant ceased,
and the industry died out, not because flax would not thrive, for it grows
well in suitable localities, and yields excellent fibre as well as fine seed.
Under the system adopted in an adjoining State of dew-retting and harvest

ing by means of a mowing machine, the old, difficult, and expensive methods of retting and
pulling are unnecessary, and flax-growing has become profitable.
Should the supply of fibre or linseed ever exceed the demand in Australia, there is always
a market to be found for any surplus in Great Britain or in Europe. The growing of flax,
if only on a small scale on farms wherever stock are kept, deserves to be encouraged for the
production of linseed for home use, for the seed is of considerable value for the use of stock,
including pigs.


Another fibre plant, the real value of which has, until comparatively recently, been
overlooked, is the Phormium tenax , known generally as New Zealand flax, although it is not
a true flax. It is a native of New Zealand, and flourishes there chiefly about the margins
of swamps and such like places. The supply of fibre was obtained from plants in their
wild condition until com-
paratively recently ; but
now this plant has become
so valuable that it is
being cultivated to a great
extent, and is highly profit-
able. This “ flax,” which
grows well in New South
Wales, deserves attention,
and will probably, before
many years have passed,
become extensively grown
in those localities where it
will thrive best. Green flax

present time about 12s. 6d.

thrive well about the North Coast districts. It may also succeed in many other parts of
New South Wales, but so far experiments have been confined to the north-eastern portion
of the State.
Experimental samples, forwarded by the Agricultural Department to the Agent-General
in London, have been well reported on by experts. The cultivation is easy, and the cleaning
of the fibre by no means difficult. So far the industry has not been taken up by any of the


settlers, who appear disinclined to embark on any other industry than that of the production
of milk, although the cultivation of the Sisal plant is well worth an extensive trial.
The mulberry silkworm succeeds admirably in this State, and excellent silk has been
produced. Here, too, the white mulberry thrives like a weed, but so far the silk-producing
industry has never advanced beyond the experimental stage. No doubt when population
becomes denser this industry will be taken in hand successfully.
BROOM MILLET AFTER REAPING.
Cotton has been produced of excellent quality in many parts of this State,
but no attempts have yet been made to produce it on a commercial scale ;
still it is worthy of attention, and probably will, in the not very remote future,
be taken in hand by settlers in connection with other crops. The growing
of broom-millet is profitable to many of those who cultivate it, and who

take the necessary care in its production. The cultivation and treatment of this fibre are by
no means difficult, and can be carried out by any intelligent person. The price for the fibre
varies considerably, and according to quality. One of the best varieties to grow is the “ White
Italian.” The price of this ranges from 15s. to 355. a cwt., and the yield of heads averages
15 to 20 cwt. an acre


The production of onions should, in suitable localities, prove remunerative, sometimes
hi B hl y so > an( l tbe production of seed of high quality is well worth attention, the price ranging
from 30s. to £2 and £3 a pound weight. The crop needs a good deal of attention, especially
during the early stages of the plant s growth, and attention to the proper time for harvesting
is also necessary. Loss is sometimes occasioned by harvesting before the onions are thoroughly
ripe, the consequence being that they heat when bagged and marketed, and will not keep for
any length of time.
The ground-nut, or pea-nut, grows well in many parts of the State, and
should prove a profitable adjunct to other crops. But it is not grown to
any extent here, and market requirements are met by large importations.
Arrowroot, Canna edulis, grows like a weed in all the warm coastal districts
of the State, and excellent arrowroot, for domestic purposes, is produced; but

so far as is known, not for commercial purposes, although if the necessary care for its
production for the market be taken, it should prove profitable. In the warmest of the
coastal districts the true arrowroot, Maranta arundinacea and other species, will thrive well.
The starch from this plant brings the highest price for arrowroot, and although the yield from
it is not so great as that from the Canna edulis it should prove more profitable. The manu-
facture of the starch from the roots is simple in the extreme, and sufficient arrowroot for
domestic purposes can be provided at the cost of but little trouble.
Tobacco of excellent quality has been and is produced in the State ; and
it seems almost certain that the tobacco plant will shortly be extensively
cultivated in many districts, both for plug tobacco and cigar wrappers.

CHAPTER XXV.
Irrigation and Water Conservation.
What has been done — Possibilities—Future Prospects.
BY H. G. McKINNEY, M.I.C.E.
(formerly chief engineer for water conservation).
D Tis not proposed in this article to deal with irrigation from the
engineer’s point of view, but from the standpoint of the
pastoralist, the farmer, and the fruit-grower. Not many
years ago a great majority of those interested in land in
New South Wales were very decided in the opinion that
while irrigation might be profitable in a country like India,
where labour is cheap and abundant, it would be folly to
attempt it here on account of the expensive labour and
sparse population. These notions have, however, almost
disappeared under the light 'of recent experience, which
has shown that irrigation can be carried on as successfully
with the expensive labour of the Western States of America as with the cheap labour of India.
As irrigation has been successfully tried in almost every district of New
South Wales, it may fairly be regarded as having passed the stage of experi-
ment. The most recent argument advanced against it is that even as far
west as the river Darling, which is far outside the agricultural belt, crops
can be grown with a fair degree of success in two out of three years. While

Stage.
this may be admitted in a general sense, the point of interest here is the net result obtained
from unirrigated land in the western districts of New South Wales and irrigated land of a similar
character and with a similar climate elsewhere. For the purposes of illustration, the experiences
of a pioneer irrigator at Kerang (Victoria) may be taken and compared with results obtained at
Narromine. New South Wales. I have selected a year in which the Narromine rainfall was
slightly over its average, 21 inches. The cultivated land in the county of Narromine consists
chiefly, if not entirely, of the rich alluvial land adjacent to the river Macquarie. The nature
of the soil and general characteristics of the Wimraera District (Victoria) correspond in many
respects with the conditions in the county of Narromine, and, therefore, the comparison is a
fair one. The yield per acre of crops on unirrigated land in the county of Narromine was as


follows ;—\\ heat, 10J bushels ; hay, 1 ton 2 cwt. ; maize, 25 bushels ; barley, 10 bushels ;
oats, 28f bushels; oaten hay, 1 ton 12 cwt.; potatoes, 2 tons. The results obtained at Kerang as
the result of irrigation were:—Hay, from 2 to 4 tons per acre ; wheat, never less than 20 bushels
and up to 45 bushels ; oats, 40 to 70 bushels ; Cape barley, 30 to 52 bushels; and potatoes,
9 tons. To summarise, it may be stated that irrigation in the Wimmera, as compared with
cultivation on the Macquarie with the aid of the rainfall only, gave double the quantity of wheat,
treble the quantity of barley, and more than four times the quantity of potatoes.
To illustrate further the character of the crops which western farmers
obtain in good seasons from land of great fertility, the returns from the counties
of Nandewar and Baradine for 1904 may be given. These counties include
some of the finest land along the course of the river Namoi, and it is reason-
able to suppose that the land put under cultivation was deemed to be well
An

Comparison.
suited for that purpose. For the county of Nandewar the returns give 15*5 bushels of wheat
per acre, 1 6 tons of hay, 20*5 bushels of
maize, 20 bushels of barley, 20 bushels of
oats, and I*B tons of potatoes. In the county
of Baradine the yield was 18 bushels of wheat,
17 tons of hay, and 22-5 bushels of maize.
These are the crops which a western farmer
has to be satisfied with under exceptionally
favourable conditions.
On the splendid agricultural land situated
in the Riverina the average yields in the same
year were : —Wheat, 18 bushels per acre ;
wheaten hay, I*7 tons per acre ; barley, 22’9
bushels per acre ; oats, 234 bushels ; and
potatoes, T 8 tons.
In the district bordering on the river
Darling so little cultivation has been at-
tempted that we have no safe basis of com-
parison ; but accepting the statement made
by those who take an optimistic view of cul-

tivation without the aid of artificial waterin'.; we have the fact that crops can be obtained in
two years out of three. Assuming this to mean that in the two years regarded as successful
crops of grain amounting to 12 bushels per acre, and that in the year of failure a crop of
3 bushels, are obtained, we have an average yield of 9 bushels per acre. To compare with this
crop as an average, there is a case of Mr. Garden, of Cohuna, in the north-west of Victoria, who,
in a very dry year when the yield on unirrigated land around was only about 2 bushels per acre,
obtained a crop of from 20 to 40 bushels per acre by giving a watering which he estimated as
equal to 5 inches.


It may be urged that it will not pay to irrigate grain crops in view of the
low price which wheat sometimes touches. But, in the first place, there is
no reason why irrigation should be confined to grain crops ; and, in the second
place, the question as to whether it will pay depends on the character of the
land, its position as regards communication and markets, and the price at

which water can be supplied. As regards the variety of crops which can be artificially watered
with advantage, the reply given by Major Powell, who is in charge of the Geological and Water
Conservation Surveys in the United States, to a Committee of the Senate, is instructive. Major
Powell stated that irrigation in the Western States is successfully practised with every variety
of crops from those grown in Norway to those grown in Egypt. In connection with the various
statements to the effect that irrigation of low-priced crops does not pay, some of these recall
the remark of the potato-dealer who said that he was losing 3d. on every bushel he sold, and that
the only thing that kept
him from ruin was the
fact that he was doing an
extensive business. If a
farmer working under
natural conditions raises
a crop of 12 bushels per
acre, which is worth 2s. 6d.
per bushel, I fail to see
how he will lose if by the
extra expenditure of 7s. 6d.
or even 10s. per acre he
increases his crop to 24
bushels per acre. This is
really understating the
case, for it is a matter of
common knowledge that
the ordinary producer’s
extremity is the irri ga-

tionist’s opportunity. In short, the question whether or not irrigation will pay depends on
the very simple question “ At what rate can the water be supplied ? ”
It is obvious that for low-priced crops cheap water is a necessity. As
n extreme case of this kind it will probably surprise some to know that
the native grasses have been irrigated on a fairly extensive scale, and with
most satisfactory results, in this State for many years past. There are not

many cases in which this can be done, and, as a rule, in those in which it is practicable it
would be more advantageous to put the land under cultivation. It often happens that the
banks of a river, flowing through alluvial land, are higher than the land at some distance.


It is thus practicable, sometimes with a very moderate outlay, to divert a supply of water from
a river through a cutting which gradually runs out to the ground level. Cases of this land afford
very cheap water. As a general rule it would not pay to pump water for the irrigation of the
native grasses, but there are exceptions to this rule. Several instances might be quoted in
which pumping machinery erected for the irrigation of various crops has been usefully turned

to account for the flooding of grass land ; but there is little doubt that in every case the
returns would have been better if the power available had been used exclusively for crops.
It is not intended here to recommend the irrigation of pasturage, but the inference to be
drawn from the fact that such irrigation is practicable is that the field for artificial watering
of crops is much wider than is generally supposed.
It may be mentioned that in Upper India the rates charged for sufficient
water for wheat, barley, and other winter crops vary from 2r. 4a. to 4 rupees
per acre ; while for maize, millet, and most other summer crops, excepting
rice and sugar-cane, the rates vary from lr. 10a. to 2r. 10a. per acre. The
above rates are about equivalent to from 2s. Bd. to 4s. Bd. per acre for
Indian and

Rates.
wheat and barley, and from Is. lid. to 3s. Id. per acre in the case of maize and millet. In
the Western States of America the average annual cost of water for irrigation is slightly over
a dollar an acre. The American farmer has thus to pay a higher rate as a rule for water than
has his Indian competitor.
Water could be supplied by pumping on a large scale from several of our western rivers
at a cost of about 4s. per acre if the pumping and distribution were properly managed. Those
who have access to river frontage in this State can, therefore, obtain water for irrigation at
a cost not exceeding the average American rates. In the joint report prepared by Mr. F. W.
Ward and myself regarding the river Darling, it was shown that irrigation in the neighbourhood


of Bourke would place that part of the river Darling in a position to compete with unirrigated
land situated 200 miles nearer Sydney. I may state that this subject was dealt with in detail
by Mr. Ward, who spared no pains in investigating it.
The question is frequently raised as to whether the supply of water in the
State is sufficient for irrigation on an extensive scale. This is a subject
which it would be out of place here to discuss at length, but it may be reassuring
to state that though we are at a great disadvantage in possessing no mountains
covered with perpetual snow, still our western rivers if properly utilised should

irrigate at least half a million acres. When our irrigated area approaches that limit, we can
greatly augment our available supply by the construction of storage reservoirs.
Much has been said and written on the subject of the spread of alkali by
irrigation. So far as India is concerned some of these statements give a
very incorrect impression. It is quite true that the level of springs has risen
materially in districts which have long been under canal irrigation, and that
in some cases extensive drainage works have been rendered necessary. This

subsoil; but admitting all this, it is necessary to state that some writers have exaggerated
the mischief done, and have quite overlooked the compensating benefits conferred. Some years
ago the statement was made, on apparently good authority, that salty efflorescence was extending
greatly in India, and that canal irrigation was the chief cause of this. The question was care-
fully inquired into by an engineer of the Punjab Irrigation Department, and among other matters
brought to light was the fact that the lands most affected by the reh, as the efflorescence is locally
termed, had not only never been irrigated, but were actually above the level at which the water
could be supplied. This description applied specially to the district irrigated by the Western
Jumna Canal—a district which was considered to be one of the most seriously affected by the
reh. In his admirable work on “ Irrigated India,” Mr. Alfred Deakin referred to reh not as
a pest which is spreading, but as one for the eradication of which systematic action is being taken.
During the course of my period of service in India I had considerable experience with this alkali
question, and the advice, based on this experience, which I should give to anyone starting
irrigation, is briefly this ; “ If your land contains more than an average proportion of salt, do not
try irrigation”—“lf your land is suitable for irrigation, be careful to keep your distributary
channels on good land throughout their whole length.” It is necessary to add that land which
is not fit for irrigation, so far as regards a high proportion of salt, is so uncommon in New South
Wales that little need have been said now on the subject if it had not been that an exaggerated
importance has been given to it by various writers.
It may reasonably be asked—if irrigation is a question of great importance
to the agriculturists and the pastoralists of this State, why has it not been
more widely adopted ? The main reason is that formerly existing laws tended
to repress and not to encourage irrigation enterprise; and until a law was
passed under which definite water rights could be conferred, no material

development of irrigation enterprise was to be hoped for. An Act dealing with this vital question
was passed in 1896. To their credit, many landholders
undertook the risk of erecting pumping machinery for
irrigation works, and many more constructed dams for
the storage of water in the creeks and rivers. Previous
to the passing of that Act the pastoralist, the farmer,
and the fruit-grower constructed dams and erected
pumping machinery on our creeks and rivers on
sufferance only, and it is, therefore, not remarkable
that small progress has been made with irrigation ; on the contrary, it is surprising that so much
has been done. We often hear of the benefit to be derived from the proper use of manure, and
results are quoted which show that it is quite practicable by j udicious manuring to obtain more
weight of crops off 40 acres than can be obtained from 80 acres of unmanured land. The waters
of some at least of our western rivers contain an appreciable proportion of fertilising matter ; but,
apart from this, water supplied in sufficient quantity to crops at suitable times gives a large increase
in the yield, so that the argument regarding the benefits of manuring apply also to irrigation.


PROJECTED GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES.
Mr. L. A. R. WADE,
PRINCIPAL ENGINEER FOR RIVERS AND WATER SUPPLY,
Contributes the following particulars of irrigation enterprises at present projected by the
Government of New South Wales :
The three main irrigation schemes which the Government of New South Wales have
at present in view arc the Northern Murrumbidgee Irrigation Scheme, the Southern Mur-
rumbidgee Irrigation Scheme, and the Murray River Irrigation Scheme.
The first of these which it is proposed to take in hand is the Barren Jack Reservoir and
Northern Murrumbidgee Irrigation Scheme, though whether under Government control or
that of a private company is a matter not yet decided, but is at present being investigated by the
Parliamentary Public Works Committee, on whose recommendation the Legislature will decide
as to which method of carrying out the work will be sanctioned.
The Government scheme embraces the construction of—
(1.) A high masonry dam across the Mumimbidgee River at the “ Barren
Jack site, about 22 miles south-west of the town of Yass, on the Main
Southern Railway line. This dam, designed to hold a depth of 200 feet

immediately above it, forms
the Barren Jack Reservoir,
backing the water up the
Mumimbidgee River for a
distance of 40 miles, and
having a capacity of 766,324
acre feet of water. This
reservoir is intended to
retain flood-waters, which
will be released for use
lower down the river during
the dry summer months.
(2.) A movable Di-
version Weir on the Mur-

rumbidgee River, about 220 miles below the Barren Jack Dam, and 19 miles above the town
of Narrandera, on the South-western Railway line, to turn the required amount of water from
the river into the main canal.
(3.) A main canal, taking off from the river just above the Diversion Weir, having a course
through the town of Narrandera, and thence following the western edge of the high ground in


a generally north-western direction, together with a branch canal, commanding practically all
the land lying to the westward as far as Hay and Gunbar.
(4.) A series of main and subsidiary distributing channels taking off at intervals from
the main and branch canals to distribute the water to the various small holdings.
The amount of high-class irrigable land commanded by this canal is
estimated at 357,000 acres. Nearly half this area is freehold held in big
estates, on which it is proposed to impose an irrigation rate leaving the
subdivision in the hands of the present owners if they so desire. The balance,

it is proposed to acquire and subdivide into small irrigation holdings up to 100 acres in area,

and to sell to settlers on easy terms. This land will also be liable to an irrigation rate.
The rate proposed will be equal to a charge for water of ss. per acre foot, which gives the
very moderate annual rate of 10s. to 12s. 6d. per acre for a full supply of 24 to 30 acre inches.
On both parts of this scheme a considerably larger area of land is commanded than that given
as “ irrigable,” and consequently fair sized holdings of “dry ” land to be worked in conjunc-
tion with the irrigated areas for stock-raising purposes should be available. The soil in this
locality, especially that nearest the hills, is of a splendid quality for irrigation culture, capable
of growing to perfection all fruits suitable to the climate, lucerne, and other fodder crops of
all descriptions, and this is confirmed from actual results in the locality and the official reports


of the experts of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture. A system of mixed
farming with a good water supply should, therefore, command certain success, while the quality
of the soil, a deep rich sandy loam, the terms on which the Government could afford to sell
it, and the security of the water supply will render this scheme an ideal one for small settlers.
In addition to these high-class lands suitable for intense culture and closer settlement, an
area of about 1,000,000 acres of pastoral lands will be commanded. This area will be supplied
with water for stock purposes and the irrigation of a small proportion of fodder crops.

The construction of the Barren Jack Reservoir will provide sufficient
water for another scheme of irrigation on the southern side of the Murrum-
bidgee River, directly opposite to that on the northern side, to be known
as the Southern Murrumbidgee Irrigation Scheme, but this will not be put
in hand till the Northern Scheme is well under way. The irrigable land

under this scheme of an approximate area of 500,000 acres will, as far as at present determined,
be left in the hands of the present owners for subdivision, the Government supplying and
charging for the water at a similar rate to that proposed for the Northern Scheme.
The Murray River Irrigation Scheme is proposed to water the country
between the towns of Corowa and Deniliquin in the Riverina district of
New South Wales. This scheme, like those on the Murrumbidgee River, is
dependent on the storage of flood-waters in a reservoir on the upper part of

the river, such waters to be released for use during the summer months, when the river is


ordinarily low. A diversion weir at Bungowannah, a few miles below Albury, will turn the
water into the main canal, down which it will flow for some 39 miles before the land to be
irrigated is commanded. Altogether some 900,000 acres of irrigable land and 500,000
acres of pastoral land are commanded by the main canal (which will have a total length of 99
miles) and laterals, the water available being sufficient to irrigate 1 acre out of every 9
of the irrigable land at the approximate cost of ss. per acre foot to the users. The irrigable
land is a rich, red, loamy soil, of a splendid quality for irrigation culture, and its subdivision
for closer settlement is proceeding rapidly at the present time, and will be much accelerated
when a supply of water for irrigation is available.

SOME PRACTICAL IRRIGATING HINTS.
By W. J. ALLEN,
GOVERNMENT FRUIT EXPERT.
If there were a few' locks on the Darling, Murrumbidgee, Macquarie, and Edwards
Rivers, and the landowners were to take up the irrigation question in earnest, it would be
quite possible for Australia to carry double the stock and grow five times the quantity of
wheat without any risk
whatever. Such a state
of things cannot be
brought about all at
once, as the people have
to be educated up to
the manner of using the

results have been obtained, and it is on such land, whether it be alluvial such as is found
in many of our river Hats, or the light to medium loamy soil, with or without limestone nodules
in the subsoil, that we shall find some of our best land for growing crops under irrigation. In
the schemes described by Mr. Wade as being projected by the Government, it is proposed that
water should be delivered by gravitation on to some of the best land we have for irrigation
purposes. There are several different classes of land, some of which is suitable for growing
the very best fruits for either drying or the fresh fruit trade ; while some is first-class lucerne
land, which will produce six cuts of hay per annum. Other portions are suitable for the culti-
vation of sorghum, wheat, vegetables, cotton, or tobacco. Dairying and raising lambs for export
and pigs for bacon would also be profitable industries to take up within these areas. In our
warm and genial climates, with a sufficient supply of water intelligently applied to our best
lands, there should be no such thing as failure.
Apart from the problem of land suitable for irrigation, and a supply of
good pure water, free from any injurious chemicals, there is the question of
applying the water to the different crops. Two methods are usually followed —
Hooding and furrows. Sub-irrigation is practised on a limited scale in a few

places but is rather an expensive undertaking. The furrow system is that most generally used
wherever it is practicable, as it is economical, there is a minimum loss through evaporation,


and the water can be so handled that the land receives an even soaking. There is very
little, if any, waste water, and the furrows can be cultivated as soon as they are dry enough.
Land well cultivated after being irrigated retains the moisture, the loose soil on the top acting
as a mulch, and preventing evaporation. It will, therefore, be seen that crops so watered and
worked will require less frequent waterings than where cultivation is not carried out. In
irrigating through furrows care should be taken to see that just sufficient water is turned into
a furrow to keep it wet from top to bottom, as by so doing the land receives a thorough soak-
ing without damage by scouring as is the case where an unnecessarilv large quantity of water
is allowed to run.
In America it is not an unusual sight to see flaming in place of earthen
channels, and the water is turned into the furrows by opening a small slide
made of thin galvanised-iron, which can be so regulated as to permit just the
desired quantity of water to run into any one furrow, and one man can attend
to several hundred furrows with but little trouble if the land is properly

levelled, and the head channel or flumes are properly constructed. All land required for irriga-
tion should, therefore, be properly levelled, and suitable head channels made, before any attempt
is made to run water, and much trouble and labour in after years can be avoided by
attending to this work. In ordinary earth channels it is well to have drops at convenient
distances so that by closing one or putting in an extra slide it will raise the water sufficiently
high to divert it into the different furrows. Holes may be cut in the side of the head drain to
allow the water to run into
the furrow f s, and straw,
weeds, or hessian may be
used for equalizing the flow
of water. Of course, this
is a makeshift, and sluice-
boxes will be found much
better. These should be
let into the banks of the
channel, and through these
the water is run into the
furrows, and the quantity
of water regulated by a
slide. As there are gener-
ally a few weeds or a little
moss in the water, it is

slides from time to time in order to keep them free from any such rubbish and ensure a
regular flow. A constant watch should be kept on all furrows to see that the water does not
break and spread over the land to its detriment.


Another important point, which in this country is very often neglected,
is a waste-water drain, so situated that it will catch any surplus water and
deliver it on to some other section of the farm where it can be used. It also

of the reported failures at the different artesian bores are traceable to this —the use of too much
water, and lack of cultivation—rather than to any other of the many causes brought forward
at times by those who claim that artesian water is not suitable for irrigation.

size from one-half to 1U acres. Around each block there is a bank thrown up to a sufficient
height to keep the water within the block. The sides of the bank should have a gradual fall
so that machines, waggons, and carts may be driven over easily during the harvesting operations.
Before sowing lucerne seed the land should be watered if it is dry, then ploughed to a good
depth, and if it has been well worked up and levelled before the last irrigation, it should be
harrowed, and rolled with a light roller, and then the seed sown in drills 9 inches apart, using
from 10 lb. to 12 lb. of seed to the acre. If the work is properly done the seed will come up
well, and will not require a further watering until it is several inches high. A good time for
sowing is the early autumn, some time early in March, or, if sown in the spring, September or
October are good months. After the seed is well up, a light harrowing would be found bene-
ficial to the plants. As soon as the lucerne is from 10 to 12 inches high it is well to cut it and
allow the hay to remain on the ground. This will tend to make it stool out and thicken up
so as to cover the ground. The lucerne should be given a thorough watering just before cutting,
so that it will make a strong growth after cutting. The best results are obtained if the
crop receives a thorough soaking every month through the six hottest months.


For planting trees and vines the land should be levelled preparatory to
planting. If it is damp, the trees may be planted without running the water
down a furrow between the double stakes, but should the planting be done
when the ground is dry, it is best to soak the ground before planting. Again,
as soon as the trees are planted, the sooner the water reaches the newly-
Trees
and
Vines.
planted tree the better are the chances of making a strong start. The same remarks apply
to the planting of vines. As soon as the ground is dry all young trees and vines should be
well worked around with a fork hoe, and the soil between the rows worked to a fine tilth.
Should the weather continue hot and dry a second irrigation should be given to citrus trees
within three weeks from the date of planting. Deciduous trees or vines would not require
water so quickly, but if the young plants do not start readily, watering must not be neglected,
as there is nothing like plenty of water for newly-planted trees. After they are well established
less water may be used, but plenty of
cultivation should be given, this being of
as much importance as the water. After
the first year or two deciduous trees should
not require more than two or three irriga-
tions during the summer, but they require
plenty of cultivation from the early spring
throughout the summer.
Citrus orchards usually require more irri-
gations than deciduous, but the trees
should not be kept growing too late into the
fall, else the growth will be tender, and
should frosts start early the tree and fruit are
liable to be badly frozen. It will also be
found that citrus fruit taken from trees irri-
gated late will not keep as well as fruit
taken from trees which have not been

over irrigated or watered late. If vines are well watered in the winter they will not require
so many summer waterings, but the ground must be cultivated deep and often. Avoid water-
ing when the grapes are flowering and setting.
For potatoes, work the land up well, and if it be dry, irrigate just before
ploughing. Plough deeply as soon as the land is dry, and plant immediately.

good irrigation, or at the most two, are all that is required for a crop, and these should be given
before the young potatoes are any size, as late watering will induce a second growth, which
Spoils the tubers. The secret in potato-growing is good cultivation combined with no more
water than is necessary to keep the plants in good growing condition. The spring crop should be
planted as soon as the severe frosts are over, which is usually towards the end of August, and

the autumn crop in February. They should be planted in drills 3 feet apart, and when it is
found necessary to irrigate, furrows may be drawn midway between the rows and water allowed
to run until the ground is well soaked. As before stated, two waterings with good cultivation
should be sufficient for any crop of potatoes. The autumn crop will naturally require one or
two more waterings than the spring crop, as the ground is naturally drier at that time of the
year, and the heat more intense.
Peas may be sown in drills in moist soil. If sown during hot weather

as for potatoes.

ground should receive a thorough cultivation. Future waterings should be made through
furrows drawn between the rows. This crop is usually raised for green feed for milking cows
or for ensilage. Under irrigation very heavy crops can be produced.


Unless the ground is moist it is best to saturate it thoroughly with water
for grain, and as soon as it is dry enough it should receive a good deep plough-
ing and harrowing, and the seed should be drilled in from day to day. The
Grain.
grain will soon make its appearance above ground. By working the ground in this way it holds
the moisture much better than it would if the land were ploughed while dry, and the seed sown
and irrigated to cause germination, as this latter process tends to set the soil. It will then
require a second irrigation long before that which had received the watering before ploughing.
At the time of harvesting it will be found that the heaviest yield will come from that portion
which had been watered before being sown. When seed is sown in moist soil it usually requires
no irrigation for two or three mouths, during which time the grain will make a good growth
and send its roots down deeper than in soil which had received an irrigation directly it was sown.
By the time the moisture stored in the ground before sowing has evaporated the grain will
have made a good growth, therefore when water is applied evaporation from the soil is not
so great as it would be from crops irrigated at an earlier stage. Hence the soil of such fields
remains in much better condition than that in those irrigated directly after seeding, and the
grain has an opportunity of making a correspondingly better growth, and in consequence gives
a greater yield. Immediately after sowing, furrows should be drawn at distances of from
3 to 4 feet apart, for future waterings.
Sorghum is sown on deeply worked moist soil, and furrows made at dis-
tances of from 3 to 4 feet apart, through which to run the water for future
irrigations. Good crops of this fodder plant can be grown on fairlv heavy

soil. Many other crops, such as pumpkins, cabbages, cauliflowers, squashes, onions, water-
melons, tomatoes, strawberries, and all other garden vegetables, can be grown with verv little
trouble. W here trees, vines, or other fruits and vegetables are grown under irrigation care
must be taken to see that the water does not How over the surface of the soil about the trees
or plants, and that after each irrigation the cultivator is brought into requisition, and also the
fork hoe for loosening the soil close to either trees or plants.

CHAPTER XXVI.
The Fisheries of New South Wales.
Their extent and value An undeveloped mine of wealth.
BY FRANK FARNELL,
CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF FISHERIES FOR NEW SOUTH WALES.
i'a BW South Wales possesses a shore line of over 700 miles,
$ k v B off which are splendid, but undeveloped, fisheries. Her
j 8 numberless inlets, superb harbours, and extensive rivers
teem with fish life. Some of the edible marine fishes are
of great value and enormous size. Huge black rock
cod, the lordly and much esteemed schnapper, jewfish,
whiting, black bream, trevally, mullet, blackfish, terag-
lin, garfish, herring, the pilchard, the anchovy, and
other varieties may be captured on the coast and in
the estuaries. Delicious oysters abound in many of
the rivers and far-extending shallow bays, and, in addition, crayfish, prawns, &c., are plentiful
in their season. The great inland rivers—the Murray, the Darling, and the Murrumbidgec
are rich in piscine life, and the far-famed Murray cod, which not infrequently attains a weight
of from 40 lb. to 80 lb. (specimens exceeding 1(H) lb. in weight have been taken), can be
caught in quantity.
Despite the fact that there is an abundance of the various species within easy reach,
the fish supply of the State is totally insufficient to meet the demands of the population, and
exceedingly dear. Fish is a positive rarity in the suburbs of Sydney, and in all the inland
towns. The people would willingly purchase supplies of fresh fish, were such available ; but
the fact remains that owing to the total want of a systematic and effective scheme of distribu-
tion they are unable to obtain an article of food for which they would readily pay fair prices,
always provided it were conveyed to them cleaned and ready for cooking, and in a perfectly
wholesome condition. Many thousands of people in the State who rarely or never see fresh
fish would gladly avail themselves of the opportunity to purchase supplies of this nutritious
food if only there were devised some means for placing it within their reach at reasonable
rates.


It seems incredible that with a population of over 1,500,000 souls, and
the great possibilities staring us in the face, an association has not been
formed long ago to develop the enormously prolific fisheries of New South
Wales by the establishment, on large and substantial bases, of the important
Undeveloped
Industries.
industries of fish-capture, oyster-culture, fish-distribution, fish-curing in all its branches, whaling,
and, indeed, the pursuit of every industry which has its origin in the products of the sea,
including the manufacture of fertilisers from fish refuse and the non-edible section, and the
extraction and refinement of fish oils. Most of these industries have hitherto been culpably
neglected, some having been in the main conducted by incapable and inexperienced persons,
while others of them have not been touched at all. Viewed from results achieved in other
countries by the judicious development of their fisheries, it seems safe
to assert that large financial returns are available to any who will take

article of food,
is esteemed
both as a deli-

produced in profusion in the bays and inlets along the New South Wales coast, and all
that is required is capable management and systematic cultivation to establish a sure
source of profitable income.
Fish Imports to
New South
Wales.
Salting, drying, tinning, and smoking the excellent edible fishes which
abound in New South Wales waters should form special departments in any
association's operations, and should prove profitable in the extreme. When
it is considered that for the five years ending December, 190-4, frozen and
preserved fish to the value of £782,000 were imported into New South Wales,
the neglect to utilise the raw material of a better class waiting unheeded at the very doors


of the colonists is simply amazing. It is open for private enterprise, not only to take up the
opportunity, but to add to its value by initiating a scheme for the export of prepared fish to all
parts of the world. Another feature in the operations of any company, and one new to the
State, should be the supply of fish gutted and scaled ready for cooking, not only in the metro-
politan and suburban areas, but in the cities and populous towns of the interior. Given an
effective system of distribution, there seems no reason whatever to doubt that the opportunity
of obtaining at cheap rates regular supplies of such tasteful and nutritious articles as fish food
and oysters would be largely availed of.
For a considerable time past immense sums of money have been subscribed
in England for colonial gold-mines. To my mind, the marine and inland
fisheries of New South Wales offer to capitalists far more tempting and
certain and wider fields for investment than many of the gold-mines ; all that

is necessary is to develop the fisheries, place the fishing industries upon substantial bases, and
thoroughly exploit the large and ever-expanding
market which awaits those skilful enough to cater
for the same. Any company formed should be to
some extent co-operative, embodying the principle
of payment by results, thus ensuring the utmost
diligence and interest on the part of employees
in the prosecution of their work, and rendering the
association independent of the fluctuations of the
local labour market. The payment of a small bonus
annually to those employed by the company would
stimulate to far greater activity than would obtain
under ordinary conditions, and greatly assist in the
success of the undertaking.

finest species and in almost inexhaustible quantities are at all seasons of the year obtainable
in the vicinity of these places.
There is an abundance of the very choicest fish within the waters of New
South Wales. The people of Sydney and the inland towns would readily
purchase fish at reasonable rates, but are prevented from so doing by the
total lack of a proper system of fish distribution. The annual value of the
fish at present sold through the market in Sydney amounts, roughly speaking,

well-boats, curing and smoking establishments,
tons and tons of valuable fish food are wasted
every year, and the fishermen and the public
have suffered as a consequence. There is an
undoubted market; the supply of fish is proved
to be immense and practically inexhaustible ;
all that is needed is for private enterprise to
work the matter up on right fines, and success
is more than certain.
It is undeniable that in the seas which
surround our continent there is a store of wealth
in the shape of natural food supply, the
neglect of which by a hardy and enterprising
population seems almost inexplicable, and is
only to be accounted for by the ease with which
the people have been able to earn a subsistence
without resorting to this vast source of supply.
The potentiality of natural
wealth in the depth of our
waters may possibly be found
to be astounding, but as yet
those waters are unexplored.
Trawling
proved to be
possible.
Our deep-sea fishing-grounds should be one of
the chief sources of supply, and the lakes,
lagoons, &c., should be looked upon and cared
for as natural nurseries for stocking the ocean.
A trawling expedition was undertaken in the
Government steamer “ Thetis,” under my direc-
tion, in 1898, in order to test the grounds off
the coast. The result of the operations carried
out proved beyond doubt that trawling could
be carried on in connection with our offing
fisheries, and with success. The experiments
of the cruise proved that there were no serious
obstructions except that of a wreck (the
“ Minora”), the net having become fast only
once, and then on the obstruction mentioned.
I trawled for hours at a time with the current,
against the current, and across the current,
with the best of results. Again I trawled at


night time and during the day with
no varying results. Fish were
caught during night and day, of
the best varieties, of the best
quality, and in quantities that I
have no hesitation in saying would
form a payable basis on which to
start commercial operations. Lastly,
investigations were made with a
view of testing the presence of food
for fish, and as a result of these in-
vestigations the sea was discovered
to be teeming with animal life for
the fish to feed upon.
Over ninety different species
were captured on the trawling ex-
pedition, including John Dory,
schnapper, sole, flounder, skate, and
flathead, and I am just as persistent
in my belief as ever in predicting
that a thorough trawl survey would
disclose an immense field for opera-
tions in respect to fisheries which
are available for development.
The abundant harvest awaiting
enterprise off our coast only requires
human agency to ensure a most im-
portant contribution to our food
supply.

here, the people make the best use
of all the sea’s products, even to the
preparation of their fish as food for
cattle, sheep, and horses. Our con-
ditions may not necessitate going
to that extent, but I mention the
fact to show what may be done.

We are fortunate in being able to record over 500 different species of fish in our waters,
most of which are edible, and although it might be thought by some that the non-edible
section is valueless, I desire to emphasise their value in manufacturing fertilisers, for
extracting the oil, and making fodder for cattle. Opposite is a list of our principal food fishes,
which goes to show that nature has bestowed upon us quantity, quality, and variety, not
excelled in any other part of the world, and with resources like these I have every confidence
in offering every inducement to those so inclined to engage in developing the industry, feeling
sure that a profitable and lucrative field awaits those who will exploit and work the store of
national wealth contained in the ocean off our coast.
Our waters teem with fish life in value beyond computation. Here is an
annual harvest that comes as a sheer gift to our doorsteps for which the
hand of man has not delved, and over ground for which no rent is asked.
All that we have to do is to gather in this magnificent harvest, and so give
the people at a fair price an article of food they greatly need, and set up a

prosperous industry that would supply us with ssiilors, as well as with fish and fishermen. We
have persistently missed our opportunities, and harvest after harvest has been allowed to pass
us absolutely untouched. What this dereliction of duty means in industrial loss to us is shown
by the fact that in the old country, which carefully harvests this great source of wealth, the
fishing industry gives employment to over 200,000 people and a Heet of 25,000 vessels. The
monetary loss we incur by our apathy is disclosed by the fact that while New South Wales
takes only about £lOO,OOO worth of fish out of its waters, the fishermen of the old land gather
from the sea an annual harvest that averages in value millions of pounds, besides forming the
sturdy backbone of the Navy Reserve force, on which the Imperial Government sets great store.
Hut the people are not exclusively to blame for this deplorable state of things. The
Government of the old country has expended, most wisely and profitably, large sums of money
in the development of its fishing
industry, and so helped it to grow
until it was strong enough to
stand and work unaided. The
first effort made by the Imperial
Government to help the British
fisheries as a source of national
wealth was to survey the waters
all along the coast line and to
locate the best fishing-grounds.
The next step taken was to assist
the fishermen with loans on easy
terms for the purchase of boats
and gear, and the last, and by
no means least useful, work

was the kind of work that raised the fishing industry
of the old country from a small concern into the
superb source of national wealth and of food supply

profit, it was properly the work of the Govern-
ment to do, and it was well done.
If one-twentieth part of the money spent
in subsidising mineral prospecting had been
devoted to the development of our magnificent fisheries, we should have to-day a great and
prospering national industry. Our Government made an experiment in trawling, which was
successful in showing clearly how profitable would be a complete survey of our coast, and a
careful observation of the seasons of our visiting shoals, and the location of their breeding
grounds. It will be greatly to the public profit if the Government or private enterprise can be
induced to do the needful work of exploring and surveying our waters, without which our fishing
industry must ever remain practically undeveloped.

CHAPTER XXVII.
The Mineral Industry.
BY E. F. PITTMAN, A.R.S.M.,
GOVERNMENT GEOLOGIST AND UNDER SECRETARY FOR MINES.
EW SOUTH WALES has been endowed by Nature with
mineral wealth which is vast, not only in extent, but
in variety; for almost all the valuable metals and
lißSfr I minerals occur here in considerable quantities. The
first economic mineral to be discovered was coal, which
was found both at Coal Cliff in the South, and New-
castle in the north, in the year 1797. The discovery of
coal was not sufficient in itself to attract population at
that time to the country, inasmuch as the substance is
only of much value where a settled population exists, and where industries necessitating its
use have been established. The enormous supplies of coal, however, which are now known to
occur, and which extend continuously from near Singleton on the north to beyond Wollongong
on the south, and from the coastline on the east to Lithgow on the west, constitute one of
our most valuable national assets, and must contribute largely to the future prosperity of
the State ; indeed, for many years past the coal-mining industry has been one of the most
important in New South Wales.
At a moderate estimate, there are about 115,3-18,000,000 tons of coal available for mining
in this State.
The event which caused the first great influx of population to Australia was the discovery
of gold, and it was at a place called Ophir, in the Orange district, that the precious metal was
first proved to occur in payable quantities. This discovery was made in May, 1851, and its
publication had an immediate and wonderful effect on the destinies of Australia. A tide of
immigration set in from all parts of the world, and prospecting operations spread over the
whole island continent with amazing rapidity. The largest and richest goldfields were subse-
quently found in Victoria, which was originally a province of New South Wales, but was
established as a distinct colony on the Ist July, 1851. The discoveries in the mother State,
however, were also of great importance. The development of Australia was directly due to
the finding of payable gold, for of the many thousands of persons who were attracted to the


country by the prospect of a speedy fortune to be made in gold, a large proportion remained,
and engaged in other occupations after the first rush in the goldfields had abated. It was in
this way that a permanent population was settled in Australia, and such cities as Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide, and Brisbane were established.
Gold-mining in this country is still not only an important industry, but
a growing one. It is true that the more easily won alluvial deposits, which
attracted the attention of the earlier prospectors, have long since been
Gold.
exhausted ; nevertheless a more settled industry has resulted from the working of the quartz
reefs and other matrices from which the alluvial gold was originally shed, and new deposits
of this nature, of greater or less richness, are continually being opened up. The total value
of the gold won from the soil in New South Wales, from the discovery of the goldfields in
1851 to the end of 1905, is estimated at £53,235.286.
Silver was known to occur in New South Wales as far back as the year
1839, but the first attempt to work it commercially was made at Moruya
in 1864 ; the attempt, however, was a failure, owing to the complex nature

of the ore. Several more or less important silver fields were discovered subsequently; but it
was not until 1883 that the marvellous Broken Hill lode, which completely overshadowed all
other mines in this country, or perhaps in the world, w r as opened.
The history of the Broken Hill lode serves to show how easily fortunes can sometimes
be made in mines by persons who possess no knowledge of mining. The mine was “ pegged
out,” and a mineral lease applied for by a local resident named Charles Rasp, who was totally
without knowledge or experience of mineral deposits, and who was induced to take it up because
he imagined the outcrop to consist of tin ore. Mr. Rasp was a boundary rider on the Mount
Gipps pastoral holding, and when he returned to the station at night he informed Mr. McCulloch,
the manager, and the other employees what he had done, when it was decided that a syndicate
should be formed by seven of them, each person contributing the sum of £7O. There were
fourteen shares in the syndicate, and within six years from the opening of the silver mine the
market value of each of these shares, with dividends and bonuses added, was about £1,250,000.
Up to the end of December, 1905, the property originally acquired by Rasp and his partners
has paid over £11,900,000 sterling in dividends, and the prospects of the mines were never
better than they are at the present time.
The presence of tin in New South Wales was first detected in the year
1851; it was not until 1872, however, that the alluvial tin deposits of New

beds, were exploited to some extent. There still remain, however, many of these deep and
wet deposits which are practically unprospected, and as they are for the most part covered
by a considerable thickness of hard basalt, it is obvious that mining operations in them can
only be successfully carried on by companies or individuals possessing a considerable amount
of capital. Many tin-bearing lodes are known to exist in different parts of the State, but it is
rather a remarkable fact that very little has been done in the way of developing them. There

can be very little doubt that, in the future, lode-tin mining will become one of the State’s
important industries. The total value of the tin won in New South Wales from the year
1872 to 1905 was £7,436,461.
The ores of copper are among the most important of the economic minerals
of this State, and they are distributed over very wide areas. Copper was
really the first metal to he worked in New South Wales, for in the year 1845

its ores were being mined at Molong, and also at Canowindra. Since that date there has been
a large number of copper-mines worked with more or less payable results. The best-known
mine is, undoubtedly, the Great Cobar, and its prospects at the present time are exceedinglv
good. In addition there are the Nymagee, the Burraga, and the Crowl Creek copper-mines,


all of which are in a profitable condition, and many other deposits of a smaller type. The
total value of the copper produced in the State up to the end of the year 1905 was £7,667,453.
Iron smelting has not yet become a national industry with us; neverthe-
less, there is every reason to believe that it will shortly be established—in
fact, the Government has only recently accepted a tender from W. Sandford,

estimated that the Carcoar deposit contains at least 3,168,000 tons, while at Cadia there are
probably about 39,000,000 tons, including from 4,000,000 to 10,000,000 tons of the best quality.
An attempt to smelt New South Wales iron-ore was made at Mittagong as early as
1865, and ten years later a similar experiment was tried at Lithgow. In both instances the
enterprise failed for financial reasons, although extremely good iron was produced. The
principal causes of failure were the high price of labour, the cost of carriage of coal and lime-
stone, and the fact of Sydney being a free port. The conditions are altogether more favourable
at the present time, and it is therefore hoped that we are on the eve of the successful estab-
lishment of the industry.
The metal platinum has been found in several places in the State, the most important
deposits being in the neighbourhood of Fifield, to the north-west of Parkes. The platinum
occurs associated with gold in alluvial leads, the depth of sinking being from 60 to 70 feet.
Both the platinum and gold are in fairly coarse water-worn grains, and occasional nuggets
are found ; the largest piece of platinum hitherto recovered in this locality weighed 27 dwt.
The total value of all the platinum won up to the end of 1904 is only a little over £16,900.
This is mainly owing to the fact that Fifield is situated in an extremely arid district, and there
is generally a great scarcity of water for treating the alluvial wash-dirt.
New South Wales possesses considerable deposits of various kinds of
marble, but the fact that these are of decided commercial value has only
recently been demonstrated; there is now every reason to believe that an

important industry in New South Wales marble will soon be established. In addition to pure
white stone an infinite variety of colours and patterns is met with, some of the red and
yellow coloured marbles being of especially good quality, said by experts to be the equal of


any in the world. Hitherto the best samples have been obtained in the Bathurst district.
The value of the marble raised during the year 1905 is estimated at £2,420, which is an
improvement of £B2O on that for the year 1904. The quarries are being more extensively
opened up, while the imported marble is gradually being displaced.
It is rather remarkable that in a country where so many useful metals
occur, gems should also be a feature of the mineral production ; but such is
the case in New South Wales, where diamonds and precious opal are fairly

by the opal mines. Some of the precious opal from W hite Cliffs is extremely beautiful in
appearance, and the choice varieties are readily sold at high prices, £3O per ounce being a
not uncommon price for the stones in the rough. The estimated value of the opal recovered
prior to the 31st December, 1905, is £932,599.

Diamonds have been known to occur in New South Wales for about forty years, and
their distribution is very widespread. The principal localities in which they have hitherto
been won are Bingara, and the neighbourhood of Inverell. Although many thousands of
diamonds have been obtained in the tertiary gravels of these districts, they are mostly of
small size, the largest of which there is any authentic record weighing rather less than 7 carats.
Quite recently, however, a fine diamond weighing 28, 5 e carats has been discovered in a new
locality, viz., Mount Werong, about 30 miles to the south of the town of Oberon. This find
is very encouraging, as proving that really large stones are in existence, and it may be expected
to stimulate diamond prospectors to more systematic search.
Amongst other metals and minerals occurring in New South Wales
are zinc, lead, aluminium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, antimony, bismuth,
mercury, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, kerosene shale, graphite,

emeralds, turquoise, sapphires, aluuite, asbestos, diatomaceous earth, &c. The following

CHAPTER XXVIII.
Employment for Immigrants.
Good Openings for Agricultural Labourers—-Opening up of new areas of land means
increased activity in all branches of employment—Some instances of individual
success.
BY F. C. GOVERS.
IMMIGRANTS to New South Wales will find that a con-
siderable expansion in agricultural activity has led to
opening up new areas of country, and to a steady
demand for skilled agriculturists. The artisan is not
at present so much in request, although it follows
that, as the rural industries expand and develop, more
and more employment will be found for the town and
city worker. Every furrow turned sends a recurring
ripple of demand across the whole surface of the labour
market. Within recent years the Legislature has de-
voted considerable attention to industrial relations, and legislation now stands on the statute-
book providing for the pacific settlement by arbitration of industrial disputes without the
distress and suffering which inevitably follow in the wake of a strike.
In view of the fact that at present New South Wales does not offer many openings to
mechanics or artisans, it is not necessary to refer, except in a cursory way, to any employment
other than that allied with the soil.
What is immediately required in New South Wales is a vigorous and earnest attempt
to develop the soil, and the other avenues of employment will of necessity open up in due
course. The more people we settle on the land, either as proprietors or labourers, the greater
will be the need for an increased supply of carpenters, blacksmiths, painters, tailors, brick-
layers, plasterers, millers, butchers, and bakers. It has been truly said “ All wealth comes
from the soil” ; existence would be impossible without cultivation of the land ; and it matters
not whether we look at the work performed by the carpenter and blacksmith or that of the
butcher and baker, each in his way is equally dependent upon the soil for an existence. Thus
as new settlers establish themselves upon the land, the greater will be the scope for other
classes of workers.


The
Farm Labourer’s
Prospects.
Now let us take a fair and reasonable view of the position in which the
“ man on the land ” finds himself. He may start in a small way, perhaps
getting a few shillings a week in addition to his board and lodging, but by
dint of thrift and steady perseverance he will manage to save sufficient to
justify him in launching out on his own account, and the experience he
gains on “ the other man’s farm ” will be worth more than could well be estimated in cash. It
is frequently said nowadays that no man should be allowed to go on the land who does not
possess sufficient capital to make his area clear within a reasonable time. This may be sound
enough in a general way, but everything depends upon the man. Where one man will toil
strenuously and ultimately succeed in providing himself with a comfortable home, happily estab-
lished on a freehold area, another man will fail, and ignominiously too. To the man with pluck
and industry a bright future is assured. As a sample of what may be achieved by the right
sort of man, the case of Mr. Aylett, of Coolamon, New South Wales, may be quoted. Twenty
years ago Mr. Aylett walked into the Coolamon district. He hailed from Victoria, and was
looking for work, or, to put it in the colloquial way, he was carrying his swag. To-day he
has a well-improved farm, while his orchard is a wonder to every practical man who visits the
A GOOMBARGANA FLOCK.


district. One can see by the shape of the trees planted seventeen years ago that he had much
to learn, while the appearance of those which have been put down in recent years proves that
the knowledge has been gained. Often when a large proportion of the peaches going into the
Svdnev market is realising Is. 6d. and 2s. per case, peaches from this orchard—3oo miles from
Sydney—fetch 7s. 6d. per case.
This is not an isolated instance of the success which awaits the sound
and practical man who embraces opportunities as they are offered. The
man who is willing to work and save a fair proportion of his wages will,
by-and-by, find that he can reasonably make a start as a farmer on the
Not an Isolated
Instance.
“ shares system,” in which only a
small capital is necessary. With
fair average seasons and close atten-
tion to his work the “share farmer"
soon finds himself able to pay a de-
posit on a farm, and make a fairly
good start as a proprietor. This
should be the true aim of every
farm labourer. All will not succeed,
but the farm labourer is not alone
in that respect. In almost every
walk of life some inducement and
reward are offered for close appli-
cation and honest attention to duty,
but it is not for all to reach the
goal. The farm labourer’s chance
of gaining his desires is infinitely

superior to that of his brother in other walks of life. He has greater scope and better oppor-
tunities, and the employment of skill, energy, and industry will bear its own reward ; whereas,
in other avenues, a struggling employer, verging on bankruptcy, or a man who adopts the
“ sweating ” system, can break the heart of the best artisan or tradesman under his charge,
until that individual revolts, and then makes a fresh start at the same business, probably
on worse terms than before.
With farm labourers the case is different, especially in a country which
is essentially an agricultural and pastoral one. Hundreds and thousands of
fresh acres are being put under the plough each year. These new areas
are not monopolised by the original farmers. The farmers’ sons and other
Recruits

young men who have served their apprenticeship to the business have made a start for them-
selves, and thoroughly understand the task they have before them. They are sure of success—
at least as sure as one can reasonably be of anything. They have chosen their land
in a district whose climatic conditions they thoroughly understand ; they have considered


the opportunities afforded for getting their produce to market; they have looked sufficiently
far ahead to see that their financial position is strong enough to provide for the early calls
incidental to settlement in new regions ; in short, they have worked out their scheme in a
practical and business-like fashion, and nothing but the worst of bad luck can rob them of

rc« mils ate wanted, and not only are they wanted to supply the gaps thus made, but fresh
fields of employment are opening up by reason of these new farms requiring help. 8o that
the position of the farm labourer in such a country as New South Wales is one which offers
better prospects and brighter possibilities year by year.
SUTHERLAND DOCK, SYDNEY HARBOUR.
At no time in the history of New South Wales have the potentialities
of the soil been so keenly appreciated and recognised ; and what wonder
is it when one looks at the results which have been achieved by those who
derive their living from the land. On authentic information it has been

gleaned that a farmer in one of our wheat-growing centres reached New South Wales from
Yorkshire five years ago, and—not having sufficient capital to start for himself, as well as
being without experience of local conditions—decided to start wheat-farming on the “ shares ”

SINKING A WELL.
so that he could get the
friendly advice of the land-
owner when needed. Up to
the end of the last harvest
this farmer sold £4,200 worth
of wheat from the area under
cultivation, and half of this
amount belonged to himself.
Wheat is not the only crop
from which money can be
made. Some of the best wheat
land in New South Wales is
in the New England district,
but many of the sturdy farmers in that neighbourhood prefer to put small areas under potatoes,
and the results are phenomenal. A gross return of £4O an acre has been obtained in many
places, and the expenses attached to the digging of the crop are very light—about Bs. 3d. a
ton. It will thus be seen that the prospective potato-grower can make a very nice income
out of a few acres of land well prepared for that vegetable.
The young man from the United Kingdom and other countries, who has
been brought up on a farm and thoroughly understands the routine work,
will find no difficulty in securing employment in first-class agricultural and
dairying districts at the current rate of wages, viz., 15s. per week, with board

and lodging found. In many districts the best farm hands are paid 20s. per week, but these
wages are not usually offered until the employer is certain that his man is thoroughly com-
petent and careful of his (the employer’s) interests. During the harvest, which usually lasts
from five to eight weeks, additional remuneration is given to all farm hands employed on that
work, by way of reward for the extra hours they are called upon to toil in the field, and this
usually works out at the rate of double pay. The skilled ploughman, the teamster, and others
whose duties involve greater responsibility than is usually attached to the farm labourer’s
position, will readily command 255. per week and their keep.
For the youth who has had no farming experience whatever, excellent
openings are offered by successful and competent farmers, who are whiling
to instruct these young men in every branch of farm work, so that in two

or three years they will feel justified in making a start for themselves. These openings should
specially appeal to the young man who is able to command some capital as soon as he shall
have gained the requisite experience. It is found that the farmer is quite willing to pay
deserving youths small wages in return for their services, in addition to giving careful and
useful instruction in all matters appertaining to farm life. The wages offered range from
ss. to 10s. per week, according to the lad’s age and his degree of usefulness. After a time,


of course, those youths become sufficiently competent to undertake more responsible duties,
and the farmer will be agreeable to increase the wages so that they may be in accord with the
value of services rendered.
Every facility is afforded to the new arrival in the way of indicating to him the best
districts to visit. The Intelligence Department at Sydney is in daily communication with
persons in the rural districts, and the exact state of the labour requirements in any locality
is always ascertainable : apart from that, positions are in most cases actually available for
the immigrant on arrival, so that all he need do is to present himself at the Department—he
is met at the steamer on arrival and given full directions—and the rest is easy, so far as he
is concerned.
CUTTING MAIZE FOR ENSILAGE.
Exceptional opportunities are offered to industrious young women and
girls, for there' is an unlimited demand for every kind of female servant,
especially cooks, laundresses, and housemaids. The wages range from £2O
to £52 per annum, with board and lodging. These persons would find no

difficulty in obtaining situations in Sydney and suburbs immediately after landing, and the
country districts can also absorb a large number.
As already pointed out, the demand for other classes of labour is not
usually in excess of the supply, but a limited number of the very best men
in their own particular line will have little difficulty in securing suitable
posts, although it would, in all such cases, be preferable to make full inquiry

EDUCATION IN NEW SOUTH WALES.
Young Australians and Their Books.
THE provision made by the Government of the State for the
education of the rising generation has been loyally augmented
by the enterprise of at least one great Australian Publishing
House, in providing educational works especially suited to the
requirements and conditions of Australia.
£
Messrs, william BROOKS & COMPANY, Ltd.,
Are the Recognised Leaders in this branch of in-
dustry, this firm having, with conspicuous success,
placed in the hands of Principals and Teachers in
Public and Private Schools all the necessary text-
books to take scholars through their school days.
Settlers who happen to be so placed as to make
home-teaching for their children desirable, will find
the work of educating their children made easy by
the Admirable Series of Educational Books which
this Enterprising Australian Publishing House have
placed at their disposal.
READING BOOKS.—BROOKS’ Readers are the
best series of School Reading Books on the market,
and were specially compiled for the use of Aus-
tralian school children. Lord Jersey wrote of
them: “ They are excellent in every respect. The
selection of prose extracts and poetry leaves
nothing to be desired, being so graduated as to
excite the interest, and awaken the intelligence
of children. While paying due attention to the
history and natural features of Australia, the com-
piler gives to the scholars a wide insight into the
literature, legends, and historical incidents of the
British Empire, and of other parts of the world.’’
BROOKS’ HISTORIES, GEOGRAPHIES, AND
MATHEMATIC SERIES have been specially com-
piled to meet the latest educational ideas. Experts
who have travelled the world over say these books
are the best for school use they have seen.

education. Although not completely free, it is
KjlnfxS. |v almost so —the school fee being but three pence per
| week for each child, and where more than four children
of the same family attend, the aggregate weekly fee is
one shilling. There is a network of schools extending
right throughout the country, in every locality where
an attendance of even nine or ten children can be
maintained. The State, however, is not content with

EDUCATION DEPARTMENT,
this, and it has resolved that no family, however humble or however remote from the large
centres of population, shall be without the means of education. In sparsely-populated places,
therefore, where there are not sufficient children to warrant the establishment of the smallest
class of school, but where two or more families combine to engage a private tutor or governess,
the State grants a subsidy ranging to £25 a year towards the teacher’s salary. If properly
qualified, the teacher thus chosen may be a member of one of the families interested. The
schools, however, are so fully distributed over the length and breadth of the land that,
notwithstanding the great extent of territory (as elsewhere stated it is about six times the
size of England), there are only 138 cases in which it has been found necessary to grant such
subsidies.
In order to obviate the growing necessity for establishing a multiplicity of small schools,
the centralised school is becoming a prominent feature of the administration of the Public
Instruction Department. These schools can be equipped more efficiently and provided with
a better staff than the smaller ones, and the children are conveyed to and from them in
suitable vehicles, free of charge. School pupils are also allowed to travel free by rail to the
school nearest their home.
Last year, 1905, there were 2,841 schools in operation in New South Wales,
ranging from the small Provisional School, with its attendance of eight or nine
to the High and Superior Schools, with average attendance frequently over a thousand. In

caused each year by retirements, resignations, death, or other causes, about 300 new appoint-

appointed as members of the Public Service by the Governor in Council. Before appointment
they must pass the necessary medical test, and also assure their lives in order that when
they retire from the service they shall have made provision for their old age. The salaries
of principal teachers range from £lOO to £4OO per annum, exclusive of vested residences or
rent allowance in lieu thereof, and the salaries of assistant teachers range between £72 and
£250 per annum. Inspectors of schools are generally chosen from the ranks of the teachers.

education, with a special direction of the knowledge and training of the pupils towards the
class of employment they are likely to enter after leaving school.” Shorthand, typewriting,
and elocution are taught in special classes. The elder girls who have completed the course of
hand-sewing are taught to use the sewing machine, and to cut-out, measure, and calculate
the cost of the material required for garments. Cookery is taught in central schools in
various districts by specially-trained teachers. The elder girls in the neighbouring schools
attend these central schools on certain days during the week for this instruction, which is of a
thoroughly practical character. Considerable attention
is given to the subjects of Hygiene, Sanitation, and
the care and feeding of sick children and invalids.
One of the medical officers attached to the educational
staff is a lady physician, who, in addition to giving
lectures to the female students in the Training College,
visits the larger schools and gives systematic courses
of lessons to the girls in the more advanced classes.

into plots, cultivated and worked by different sections
of the pupils under the guidance and direction of the
teachers. Practical lessons on agriculture, horticulture, and botany, with the life history of
plants are thus afforded, and a taste for the beauties and wonders of nature cultivated. In

PUBLIC SCHOOL CADETS ON PARADE.


Getting away from the literary and mental aspects of our school life,
we turn to the physical culture, drill, and calisthenics, to which a portion of
the schooltime each day is devoted. The magnificent displays given annually
by the school children under the auspices of the Public Schools Athletic

this direction. Drill Instructors and Cadet Staff Officers pay regular visits to the schools.

and thousands of the schoolboys receive special military training as cadets, apart from the
ordinary school drill. They are taught the art of rifle shooting. Target practices and
parades are held regularly—special attention being given to rapid and orderly entraining and
detraining, and to discipline and steadiness. In his visit to New South Wales in 1901,
H.H.H. The Prince of Wales, then Duke of York, paid a high tribute to the military bearing
and the excellence of the training exhibited by the school cadets forming portion of his guard
of honor.
In a comparatively young community such as this, it is but natural
and desirable that much attention should be given to Technical Education,
and as a consequence no efforts are spared to make this instruction as
valuable and widespread as possible. The work of the Technical Education
Technical
Education.
Branch extends throughout the State, and is carried on by means of classes established at
the Sydney Technical College, the branch Technical Colleges at Albury, Bathurst, Goulburn,
Newcastle, Maitland, Broken Hill, and branch schools and classes at numerous suburban
and country centres. At the Sydney Technical College alone, over 4,000 students are in
attendance at the classes, which include Agriculture, Botany, Blacksmithing, Farriery, Wool-
classing, Chemistry, Assaying, Metallurgy, Mineralogy, Mining, Applied Mechanics, Pattern-
making, Boilermaking, Fitting and Turning, Ironfounding, Electrical and Mechanical
Engineering, Sanitary Engineering, Plumbing, Architecture, Manual Training, Carpentry,
Wood-carving, Drawing, Modelling, Printing, Dressmaking, and Cookery.
The fee for the technical classes varies according to the subject and the number of
lessons taken per week. The yearly course consists of three terms, and the fee for the whole


course ranges from 10s. to 255. per annum in the case of junior, and from 20s. to 50s. per
annum in the case of senior students The junior scale is charged to female students and to
male students under 21 years of age, in receipt of wages less than 30s. per week.
In view of the material advantages afforded to students, and the nominal character of
the fees, the pressure on the accommodation in the workshops of the Principal Technical
College in Sydney has become so great that the necessity has arisen for extending the existing
accommodation. Considerable activity in this important branch of education also prevails
in the other principal centres, and there are nearly 15,000 students enrolled in the different
Technical classes throughout the State. Students who so desire can attend examination each
year in the several subjects, and diplomas and certificates are issued on the result of these
examinations. Last year more than 4,000 students were thus examined, of whom the great
majority were successful.
The Technological Museums form a valuable adjunct to the Technical Education Branch.
Over a quarter of a million persons visited these interesting institutions during the course of
last year to examine the numerous exhibits. A considerable amount of research work is
accomplished, and the Museum authorities also heartily co-operate with the Public School
teachers throughout the State by assisting them to form School Museums, and otherwise in
connection with the science teaching in their schools.

The Sydney University was incorporated by an Act of Parliament, which
received the Royal Assent in 1850. It receives a statutory annual endow-
ment. As pointed out in the University Calendar, the same rank, style,
and precedence are granted by Royal Charter to its graduates as are enjoyed

by graduates of universities within the United Kingdom. It is also recognised by Charter
as one of the institutions in connection with the London University from which certificates
of having pursued a due course of instruction may be received with a view to admission to

Degrees. The University contains four faculties—Arts, Law, Medicine, and Science. Its
Degree of Bachelor of Laws is recognised under certain conditions as a qualification foi admission
to the Bar.
Its Degrees in Medicine and Surgery are registered upon the Colonial List of the British
Medical Register. The University is also recognised as one of the institutions from which
the University of London is authorised to receive certificates for Degrees in Medicine. The
University of Edinburgh accepts certificates of attendance at Medical C lasses in this University
to the extent of three years of professional study, and the Royal College of Surgeons extends
a somewhat similar recognition. The curriculum of study for the B.A. and B.Sc. degrees
extends over a period of three years, that for the degrees of LL.B., M. 8., and Ch.M. over a
period of five years, and that in the School of Dentistry over a period of four years. The
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge extend certain privileges to Sydney University students.


For instance, Sydney graduates who comply with certain requirements are admitted as
advanced students ”to the Cambridge University. Women students enjoy equally with men
the means of the liberal education afforded by the University, an education open alike to
“ all orders and denominations without distinction whatever.” There are various colleges,
connected with different religious denominations, affiliated with the University, and a College
for Women has also been established. Nine hundred and forty-eight students, of whom 112
were women, attended the University lectures last year (1905).
Various Scholarships and Exhibitions are awarded annually by the Senate, which has
also the privilege of nominating one candidate per annum to a Commission in the British
Army and to a Military Cadetship at Sandhurst.
Numerous scholarships and bursaries, apart from those given by the
University, are awarded annually to deserving students to enable them
to complete their secondary education at the Superior Public Schools,
Grammar, or High Schools. Bursaries enabling students to proceed to the
University courses are also awarded. Last year more than one hundred

Health and Allied Matters.
BY T. P. ANDERSON STUART, M.D., LL.D. (EDINBURGH),
PROFESSOR OF PHYSIOLOGY, DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE, CHAIRMAN OF THE
ROYAL PRINCE ALFRED HOSPITAL, A T C., Ac., SYDNEY.
BS-a HE information I have to give is chiefly negative. There are no
diseases peculiar to New South Wales: there are no peculiar
risks of any kind: there are no special precautions to be
taken nor provisions to be made prior to leaving the older
lands, and in view of settling in New South Wales. People
here upon the whole live the same life, eat the same sort of
food at the same meals, wear the same sort of clothes, live in
the same sort of houses, pursue the same avocations, enjoy
the same amusements, are exposed to the same diseases and
accidents, die the same death, as in the old land—all upon
the whole, for there are differences, though only of minor
importance, as we shall presently see. In what follows I
attempt to answer probable questions rather than to write a systematic treatise. I draw upon
my own experience as an immigrant and a resident in New South Wales of twenty-four years’
standing. During this period I have revisited the Old Country four times, when I have been
asked many, and sometimes, to me, amusing, questions as to Australia. My aim herein is
to tell people what my experience tells me they are likely to want to know.
The voyage may be looked forward to as a real experience and a pleasure,
by whatever route the settler comes. The chances are that sea-sickness will
be got over in the first day or two. Certain happy individuals are never

sick at all. There is no remedy for the malady, but lam sure that the frequent practice of eating
and drinking more than one ordinarily would is generally a mistake. It is better to take rather
less than usual so as not to provoke the stomach to reject its contents, and then as the condition
passes away, the appetite gradually returns, and the food deficiency will soon be made good.
Judged by latitude alone, New South Wales is on the edge of the tropics, and to this
in part are due the short twilight and the monsoonal rains that often visit us, but following
the general law that lands in the southern hemisphere have a temperature lower by about
5 degrees F. than lands in corresponding latitudes north of the equator, the climate is much
cooler than is indicated merely by its latitude, and being in the southern hemisphere its


temperature tends to l»e equable. It is one of the most temperate and uniform in the world.
There is no part of the State which is not really pleasant to live in during some part of the
year, whatever it may be during the rest.

extremity may lie compared to Sicily as regards mean temperature, and its
southern extremity to Koine and Nice; but while the mean temperature i

hemisphere, the range of temperature is not nearly so great, and this is moat important in
estimating the healthiness of the country. For instance, Sydney is just about midway
between the extreme north and extreme south of this coastal region ; its mean temperature
is 63 degrees Kahr., or almut the same as that of Naples, but at Naples the mean summer
temperature is 74 4 degrees, and the mean winter 47 6 degrees a range of 27 degrees, while
at Sydney the mean summer is 71 degrees and the mean winter 54 degrees-a range of
only I. degrees Kahr. Thus in Naples the summer is warmer ami the winter much colder
than in Sydney. The same conclusion is drawn from the range of most extreme temperatures
e\er recorded in the two places the difference lietween the highest summer and lowest winter

temperatures ever recorded in Naples being 81 degrees,
while in Sydney it is only 726 degrees. Owing
to the extreme dryness of the atmosphere, high
temperatures in New South Wales are not nearly so
oppressive as even much lower temperatures would
be in London or in France, and the high temperatures
do not, as a rule, last long.
Rain falls much more heavily in New South

Wales than in the United Kingdom, so that with a given rainfall there is more dry weather,
and when it is dry in New South Wales, owing to the dryness of the atmosphere and its
freedom from clouds, the day is generally sunny, and the nights starlit. The prevailing
winds greatly affect the climate of different places. On the coast, the moist winds from
the sea are apt to make it muggy in summer, but this does not extend far inland. A
westerly wind comes from the interior —it is dry and hot in summer, dry and cold in winter.
Southerly winds from the Southern Ocean are always moist, but they are cool in summer.
from which the mountains rise, comprise a space varying in width from 120
to 200 miles. On the high southern plateau, at an elevation of 4,640 feet,
stands the town of Kiandra, having a mean summer temperature of 56 4

degrees, and a winter temperature of 325 degrees, corresponding with that of Dumfermline
in Scotland. Cooma, in the centre of the Monaro plains, at an elevation of 2,637 feet above
sea-level, enjoys a summer as mild as either London or Paris, while its winters are far less
severe. On the New England tableland, the climate of Armidale and other towns may be
considered as nearly perfect as can be found. The yearly average temperature is 565 degrees,
while the mean summer temperature only reaches 677 degrees, and the winter temperature
falls to 443 degrees, a range approximating closely to that of the famous health resorts in the
south of France.
The rainfall in this region is nearly 33 inches. Here rise Mounts Kosciusko and Townsend
to over 7,000 feet above sea-level, where snow is perennial. In this region it is always cool at
night, even in summer, and the air is always dry, never muggy, so that one always feels fit and
active and enterprising. For every 300 feet of ascent from sea-level the temperature drops
about 1 degree Fahr.
“The climate of the great plains, in spite of the heat of part of the summer,”
says Coghlan, “ is very healthy, and an inspection of the death-rates, of both
children and grown persons, amply bears out this view. The town of Bourke

may be taken as an example. Seated in the midst of the great plain of the interior, it
illustrates peculiarly well the defects, as well as the excellences, of the climate of the whole
region, Bourke has exactly the same latitude as Cairo, yet its summer temperature is I*s degrees
less than that of the Egyptian city. New Orleans also lies on the same parallel, but the
American city is 4 degrees hotter in summer. As regards winter temperature Bourke leaves little

From this difference, temperatures are quite comfortable in the interior which would be
intolerable on the coast. Nowhere in the State is the midday siesta, so common in India,
indulged in. Punkahs are not used.
“ From the standpoint of health, it is fortunate for the country that drvness is one of
its characteristics ; otherwise, instead of being the abode of health, the interior of the State
would, with abundant rains, have become an impenetrable jungle, the lurking-place of those
malarial fevers which devastate so many fair regions of the Old World and America. New
South Wales may, therefore, be compared favourably with any part of the world ; and, taking
into consideration the comparatively low latitudes in which it is situated, it offers a most
remarkable variety of temperate climates. From Kiandra, on the highest part of the Great
Dividing Range, to Bourke, on the great interior plain, the climate may be compared with
the region of Europe extending from Edinburgh to Messina, but more generally resembling
that of southern France and Italy. It may, therefore, be regarded as peculiarly fitted for the
habitation of people of European race, embracing, as it does, within its limits, the climatic
conditions under which the most advanced races of the world have prospered.” (Coghlan.) I
know of no evidence of any deterioration of the Anglo-Saxon people due merely to residence
in New South Wales. A recent writer points out that a great distinction must be drawn
between hot dry and hot humid regions. In the former many of the mightiest nations of
antiquity had their home, e.g ., Ancient Egyptians, Saracens, &c., and Europeans thrive and
multiply, while the natives of hot humid climates have always been lacking in hardihood and
warlike propensities. Do not Australians hold a high position in all branches of manly sport ?

slates are commonest in the larger towns. The furniture and all the fittings of a house are
just the same as in the Old Country. Furniture, &c., already in the possession of the immigrant
might very well be brought, but the cost of packing, freight, insurance, duty, &c., should all
be remembered. A bathroom, or some place that serves as such, is found in every house
practically, and does not remain unused. The poor man’s shower may be a nail-can with holes


driven through the bottom—this is most efficient, and is very economical of water—a con-
sideration often of importance.
Warming of houses is not so much required as in Northern Europe. In Sydney, for
about three months, fires are usual, but in the higher lands very much longer, of course.
In an\ case, it is the night which is cold—the day is generally bright, sunny, and may be warm
pretty well all over the State. Coal in Sydney, and on the coast and railway lines, is plentiful ;
wood is generally burnt in the country. The twilight is short. Coal gas and the electric light
in the towns, kerosene in the country, are the usual illuminants. Mosquito curtains are used
on the beds at night in many places, but not everywhere, and nowhere in the winter months.
Family life in Australia is identical with family life in the United
Kingdom, and the same may be said of domestic habits and organisation in
general. One hears much of the difficulty of securing servants, but probably
Family Life.
too much of it. A good mistress generally has no difficulty in getting servants here as else-
where, but the good mistresses are just as difficult to get as the good servants. So many
people are well enough off to have a servant, but who do not know how to manage a house-
hold, that it is not surprising they cannot keep their servants. The wages arc higher than in
England, but on the other hand the Australian servant is more generally useful than the English
servant, and this compensates for the higher wages.
Clothing is very much the same as in England. Settlers should bring
any clothing they have—it will all be useful. White duck clothing-

Clothing.
the use of this material is now practically given up. Woollen cloth—tweeds, flannels, &c.
are universal. Some thin tweed or flannel garments might be worn on the hotter nart of
the voyage, and would be useful afterwards. Woollen
material is better than cotton next to the skin, for
cotton is apt to get wet with perspiration and then
lead to a chill. The so-called “cholera belt,” or
simply a band of flannel round the body, is useful in
preventing chills on the voyage. Where “prickly
heat” is likely to occur in the hot weather, wool next
to the skin may aggravate the itchiness ; then silk is
better than cotton. At night a pyjama sleeping-suit
is best—woollen by preference—especially on the

voyage. The so-called “ flannelette,” made of cotton, is very nice for many purposes, but it
should be avoided owing to its great inflammability. Many deaths occur from this cause.
Both a heavy and a light overcoat should be brought. Special head-gear is not needed
puggarees are strange, and only worn by the stranger. Ordinary articles of foot-wear are
used—a pair of rubber-soled shoes or boots are useful at certain times on the voyage.
Tinted spectacles are quite unnecessary. Much of the foregoing is as applicable to women
and children as to men.


The fashions are very much up to date. Owing to the rapid communication with Europe
we are in nowise behind in this matter, and seeing that our season follows the European
season, there is time for the new goods of any season there to reach us before our season comes
on. For the same reason also an article of dress is often much cheaper in Australia than it
was, say in London, for after the commencement of the season there our buyers can buy on
more favourable terms, and of these we get the benefit. It is, therefore, quite a mistake to
assume that “ anything will do for the Colonies.”
There are the same three meals daily as in the Old Country, of the same
materials, and cooked more or less in the same way ; hut owing to its com-
parative cheapness, meat in some form or other enters pretty well into all
the three meals. In this way, while the inhabitant of the United Kingdom

Beverages.
consumes per annum 109 lb. of meat, the
inhabitant of New South Wales consumes 269 lb.
Sugar, also, is much more largely consumed—
-75 lb. per annum per inhabitant of the United
Kingdom, but 109 lb for each individual in New
South Wales. These quantities are not exceeded
by any European nation —indeed meat and tea
three times a day is a common rule. For tea
and coffee the figures are 91 oz. in the United
Kingdom and 123 oz. in New South Wales, and for butter and cheese 19 lb. in the United
Kingdom and 25 lb. in New South Wales. The quantity of grain consumed is about the same
in the two countries. The daily energy obtained from his food by the inhabitant of the United
Kingdom is 3,522 foot tons, while the New South Welshman gets 3,982, so that the people of
New South Wales are the more fortunately placed as regards their food as a whole. No doubt
there is much waste, but nevertheless the foregoing figures show the well-being of the people.
This is also shown by the consumption of tobacco, which is nearly twice as great in New
South Wales as in the United Kingdom. Fruit is, upon the whole, abundant, but its
abundance, price, and variety vary greatly according to the different parts of the country and
the seasons and their nature. In the higher and colder regions inland, all the English fruits
flourish exceedingly, while in the lower coastal region fruit grows out of doors that only grows
in hot-houses at Home. Honey is very abundant, good, and cheap. Garden vegetables grow
exceedingly well, but in the towns are apt to be dear ; there are great openings for vegetable
farmers. Fish is abundant on the coast, but the paucity of rivers makes fresh-water fish
scarce inland ; in any case, however, it is dearer than it should be—apparently not so much
for want of fishermen as from defective arrangements for its distribution. Many of the rivers
are now, however, being successfully stocked with English and other introduced fish. Poultry
does extremely well everywhere. Game there is, according to the district and season, though
there is less than in the Old Country. Rabbits, unfortunately, are too plentiful—but that is
another story. In many districts hares now abound,

The beverage of the people is tea ; coffee is not a favourite in Australia, so that the
consumption of tea per head is 7 lb. 3 oz. per annum, while that of coffee is only 8 oz. Good
beers are brewed in the State, and New South Wales is a wine-growing country, though the
people are not a wine-drinking folk. In other parts of the world these two conditions often
go together. Whisky is the usual alcoholic beverage in the country. The Australian consumption
of proof-spirit per head per annum is 2 27 gallons, while in the United Kingdom it is 3*57.
We are, therefore, comparatively a sober people.
TEMORA RAILWAY YARD.
The cost of living may be stated generally as follows :—ln the United Kingdom the
average annual cost of food and beverages is 42 per cent, of the average earnings ; in New
South Wales it is only 38 per cent. This may be stated in another way. Suppose that in the
year fifty-two Sundays are deducted and, say, thirteen days’ sickness, there remain 300 working
days. Of these the inhabitant of the United Kingdom must work 127 days in order to pay
for his food and beverages ; in New South Wales he need only work 112 days.
In order to give the reader an idea of the cost of individual articles at the
present time, and after the establishment of the Commonwealth has had time
to have its full effects, I asked the Honorary Secretary of the Moss Vale
Retail prices.
Progress Association to furnish me with a priced list of commodities likely to be required by a


settler, and this he had kindly done as follows. Moss Vale is the centre of an agricultural
district, on the railway, and 87 miles from Sydney. The prices there may be taken as an
index to what they are elsewhere, away from Sydney. The prices of fresh meat fluctuate
with the seasons, of course, but one is safe in saying that they are only from a quarter to a
third what they are in the United Kingdom. The price of bread also fluctuates, Lut is some-

the immigration of other alien and inferior races. But the great
need of the State is a stream of desirable immigrants—more
people to cultivate the land and develop its resources.
The aborigines in 1901 numbered only 4,287 full-blooded
blacks and half-castes, who were members of wandering tribes.
3,147 half-castes were living in comparative civilisation. The
aborigines have entirely disappeared from large tracts of the State,
and in the larger towns are rarely seen. They are not an element
of the population that calls for further consideration here. The
immigrant will naturally attach importance to the nationality of
the people he is to come amongst. The following figures

illustrating the percentages of the birth-places of the inhabitants of New South Wales are taken
from Coghlan, 1901 :

degree of probability that adverse weather will not interfere.
There are good schools, churches of every denomination, libraries, schools of art, &c., &c.,
scattered all over the State, and the general habits of the people, with the sunny skies and
beautiful moonlight nights, all help to make life more joyous. Without trying to account for
it, that abject misery and wretchedness so common in the United Kingdom simply does not
exist in Australia. Coghlan writes, “In Australasia the proportion of women and children
engaged in laborious occupations is far smaller than in Europe and America, and the hours of
labour of all persons are also less.” What this means for the happiness of the people is manifest.


It may be good news for females to learn that there is a great excess of males in the population,
there being about fifty-two males to forty-eight females. The disproportion is, however,
gradually disappearing.
Owing to the genial climate, we live out of doors much more than is possible
in the United Kingdom, and the windows and doors of houses are generally,
even at night, left more or less open. Most houses have verandahs in which

much of the life goes on. Owing to the climate, outdoor exercise is freely indulged in. Cricket,
football, and cycling are everywhere, and golf is spreading marvellously. Boating and bathing
are common owing to the numerous harbours and long coast line. Riding is very common,
of course, for horses are good and cheap, so that the postman brings your letters, the butcher-
boy your pound of chops for dinner, on horseback—the lamplighter goes round to light his
lamps on horseback.
There is no disease peculiar to New South Wales, and health legislation
and administration are now very complete throughout the land—even in the
sparsely-populated districts. This, with the natural salubrity of the country

already referred to, makes the expectation of life greater in New South Wales than in the
United Kingdom and most other countries. Still it must sorrowfully be confessed that people
die even in New South Wales, though a glance at any table of the causes of death in New South
Wales, such as that given by the Government Statistician, shows that they are just such as one
might find in average European countries. The first ten causes are in their order :—Consump-
tion, old-age, inflammation of the bowels, accidents, heart disease, inflammation of the lungs,

cancer, mal-development of infants, premature birth, bronchitis, and so the list goes on with
maladies that are familiar enough to everyone. Rickets is almost unknown. Diseases of the
chest are much less fatal than in older lands.
Rheumatic fever and many forms of heart
disease are less severe in New South Wales
than in Europe.
Malaria does not arise in New South
Wales; if present, it has been introduced
from other parts. There is no small-pox in
Australasia, the only outbreaks being when it
has been introduced by oversea ships. In
every State, however, vigorous measures have
always, as yet, succeeded in stamping out

the disease. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that, vaccination not being compulsory,
few persons take the trouble to be themselves vaccinated, or to have their children vaccinated,
except, perhaps, when there is a scare owing to some ship having brought the disease.
Then there is a rush for vaccination, but so soon as the disease has been overcome at the
quarantine station the desire for vaccination evaporates almost clean away. Asiatic cholera
is another disease that has no existence in Australasia. It could only be introduced by ships,
and our quarantine administration is here again our safeguard. Also, there is no yellow
lever, and no typhus fever. So far as is known, hydrophobia has never been known in
Australasia, even although the wild dog, or dingo, is probably an old inhabitant of the
continent. Dogs are now subject to a prolonged quarantine—six months—and this, together
with the long voyage, keeps us fairly safe.
Hydatids call for some comment, owing to so much having been said about the subject.
In Coghlan’s list of the causes of death for the year 19(H), hydatids, with forty-one cases out
of a total of 15,118 deaths, stands fifty-third on the list. In New South Wales, as a cause of
death, it was in that year only one three-hundred-and-sixty-ninth of the whole, standing
between deaths from rupture (hernia) and deaths of persons “ found drowned.” In 1904 it
was sixty-third on the list and one three-hundred-and-thirteenth of the whole. This disease
is to be expected in a country where sheep and dogs are so common, for the dog is the animal
in which the egg-producing state of the tape-worm is mostly found. It is found in various
countries of Europe, and reaches its maximum in Iceland, where one-thirtieth of the whole
population is affected. Altogether it seems, to me, that too much has been said and written
about hydatids in Australia. If only more care were taken as to the disposal of offal after
slaughtering animals for food, as to the purity of the drinking water, as to the proper cleansing
of raw vegetables, and as to association of man with dogs, the figure of this disease would
doubtless dwindle away to insignificance. Like small-pox, bubonic plague has been introduced
by shipping, but having been vigorously grappled with, it was speedily got under. It never
got beyond the ports at which it was introduced.


Leprosy is present in New South Wales, but it is a disease mainly of the Chinese and
other coloured races. Whenever a case is discovered it is immediately segregated in the
Lazaret. So small, after all, is the number of cases, only an average of about one native of
the State per annum having been affected since 1883, and so much is the disease confined to
the non-white races, or to persons who have been in other parts of the world where the disease
is prevalent, that one never really gives it a thought in New South Wales.
Sunstroke, heat-stroke, or insolation, is not common, and generally it is
associated with careless exposure or debilitated state of the body. It is
not an affection to be at all considered by an intending immigrant. I
mention the matter specially, because there is an idea not uncommon in
Europe, that New South Wales is a “ hot country,” and, therefore, like

Snake-bite.
another “ hot country ” familiar to the Englishman—lndia—is subject to sunstroke. But
New South Wales is not a “ hot country,”
like India, and in New South Wales one
hears but little of sunstroke, and sees less.
The number of cases in any year depends, of
course, upon the kind of season. In 1894
it caused only one one-thousand-and-eleventh
of the deaths, but in 1897 it caused one two-
hundred-and-fiftieth, and this is the highest
rate 1 have found. In 1904 it caused one

condition from other causes altogether, and the heat, careless exposures, &c., were just “ the
last straw, so to speak, and, therefore, should not be credited with the death at all. Hut
the Statistician can only deal with the certificates as they are sent in to the Registrars.
There is a natural dread of snakes which has greatly enhanced the danger of snake-bite,
and which still more greatly increases the victim’s distress. On an average, there are from
four to five deaths in the year from snake-bite in the whole of the State of New South Wales—
chiefly children and young persons. But further, a very complete review of all the cases which
have occurred during the last fourteen years has just been made by Dr. Frank Tidswell, of
the Board of Health in Sydney, and from this investigation it is clear that had the ligature
been applied and other measures been taken as directed by the Board some of these cases would
not have died. Altogether this matter need not occasion a second thought to the settler.
Whatever way you look at it, New South Wales is a healthy country. Compared with
the death-rates of other countries, especially those of the Old World, the death-rate of New
South Wales—lo-13 per 1,000 of the population—is remarkably low. For instance, that of


Prance is \l\, of the United Kingdom is about 18£, of the German Empire 21£, of Italy 22,
and of Austria 25£. In England and Wales fifteen out of every hundred children born die
in their first year—in Australia only 10 so die. This favourable rate for
New South Wales is due to the salubrity of the climate, the absence of
pestilences, the superior social conditions of the people—good, plentiful, and

cheap food and clothing—and healthful occupations. These figures are the mean for the State,
and even this mean is gradually falling owing to health legislation, and the greater attention
which is being paid to sanitary precautions. If the figures for the country districts are taken
they are even more favourable than the mean for the State, and “ no more potent argument
could be advanced as to the natural salubrity of the State than the statement of the death-
rates, as recorded outside the walls of the metropolis.” Medical men are accessible now in even
the remotest parts, and trained nurses are everywhere available. Women generally have no
insuperable obstacles in getting obstetrical assistance even in the remotest parts. They often,
at that time, come into the nearest settlement, where there is usually provision for such cases.

admission to public hospitals everywhere. Old-age pensions of 10s. per week are given to
men and women, who reach the age of 65, who have been twenty-five years in the State, have
been of good conduct, and have no private means. As a last resource for the lonely and
destitute the Government asylums afford a more or less comfortable retreat.

CHAPTER XXXI.
Climate.
IkVjr EW South Wales may be divided up into four climatic
L | areas : —Firstly, the coastal country ; secondly, the
fcf tablelands; thirdly, the western slopes, all of which
are suitable for agricultural pursuits ; and fourthly,
the great plains which are situated roughly to the
west of the 147th meridian.
The north coast districts are favoured with a warm

ACTING GOVERNMENT METEOROLOGIST.
moist climate, liberally watered, the rainfall averaging from 40 to 70 inches annually,
with occasional totals of 100 inches. The mean temperature for the year ranges from 66 to 69
degrees; it enjoys a summer temperature of from 75 to 78 degrees, and a winter of from 56
to 58 degrees. It is particularly suitable for subtropical growth, and is seldom subjected to
excessive heat or winter frosts.
On the south coast the annual rainfall varies from 30 to 60 inches, and rarely falls short
of 80 per cent, of the average. The mean temperature ranges from 57 degrees to 63 degrees
for the year, with a summer average of from 67 degrees at the foot of the ranges to 70 degrees
near the coast, and during the winter from 48 degrees to 64 degrees over the same area. This
district is eminently adapted for dairying pursuits.
On the northern tablelands the rainfall is very consistent in quantity, falling away from
a mean annual fall of 40 inches in the east to 30 in the western parts. The temperature is
cool and bracing, ranging from 60 degrees to 54 degrees for the year, from 70 degrees to 65
degrees for the summer months, and from 44-7 degrees to 43 degrees during the winter. All
agricultural and pastoral industries flourish in this part of the State, and, like the southern
tablelands, it is eminently fitted for the breeding of high-class horses. The southern tableland
is the coldest part of the State, the mean annual temperature being generally under 56 degrees,
and at Iviandra, at an elevation little short of 5,000 feet, it is 44'5 degrees. During the summer
months it ranges from 68 degrees to 57 degrees, and during the winter from 44 degrees to 34
degrees. This country, perhaps, produces a hardier breed of commercial stock than the
northern tableland, and, like it, is largely used for agricultural and pastoral purposes. During
periods when a scarcity of feed prevails in remote parts of the State, it is largely used for
grazing stock removed from other districts, as feed is always there procurable.


The western slopes comprise the great wheat country of New South Wales, and cover
approximately a belt of land of from 100 to 200 miles wide, stretching from the Queensland
to the Victorian border. The annual rainfall is uniformly distributed over the entire area,
and varies from 20 inches on its western limit to 30 inches on its eastern. The amiual mean
temperature ranges from 69 degrees in the north to 60 degrees in the south ; during the summer
from 81 degrees to 74 degrees, and in the winter from 53 degrees to 47 degrees.
At the present time the western plains are chiefly devoted to pastoral industries, i.e.,
sheep and wool, but with the expansion of irrigation schemes and artesian bores enormous
agricultural possibilities will be opened up. The soil is very rich, and the climate, although
hot in the summer, is at all times exhilarating and healthy. The annual rainfall increases
MANLY, SYDNEY HARBOUR,
from 8 inches on the western border to 10 and 15 inches along the Darling, and then to 20
inches along its eastern limits. The annual temperature ranges from 69 degrees in the north
to 62 degrees in the south, the summer from 83 degrees to 74 degrees, and the winter from
53 degrees to 45 degrees.
Occasionally during the summer months the temperature in most parts of the State
may be uncomfortably hot, but it is generally tempered after sundown by cool breezes from
the sea over the coastal regions, by mountain and valley winds on the highlands and slopes,
and by nocturnal radiation on the plains.
The sun raises, chiefly in the tropical regions, a given quantity of water every twelve
months; and, since there is no appreciable variation in the sun’s heat from year to year, it is
reasonable to assume that an equal amount of moisture is evaporated and condensed as moisture


every year on the face of the globe. This moisture is vagariously distributed throughout the
world. Sometimes through the agency of the winds an undue amount is precipitated to the
north of the equator, sometimes to the south. The horizontal direction is
given to the winds by the revolution of the planet. The opposing direction
is given to the winds by the difference in temperature existing at the equator
and poles. The hot, moisture-laden winds rising at the equator pass as
upper strata currents to the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, while the Polar

we have two main sources governing the general circulation of winds which are acting at
right angles to one another. The part of the globe in which these opposing currents chiefly
contend lies in the subtropical regions both north and south of the equator, with the result
that vast circulation systems are formed, and which are technically known as cyclones and
anti-cyclones. The anti-cyclones constitute the primaries, although their existence was not
appreciated as early as that of the cyclones. The anti-cyclones represent bodies formed
of a superabundance of atmosphere, and mav be likened to mountains of air, and, being


elastic and acting in a measure as a fluid, they are constantly endeavouring to flatten their
peaks in order to regain a state of equilibrium. The trend of the winds flows spirally out-
wards as they progress from the centre and gradually increase in force until, upon reaching the
periphery of these vast revolving bodies, they attain the height of gales. Naturally the greatest
velocity of wind is attained in flat or neutral zones of atmosphere, which, about Australia,
lie both to the north and south of the continent, and, as a result of the rushing air, eddies or
depressions are formed in these neutral zones, which gradually intensify or diminish with the
varying height or pressure of the high or anti-cyclonic system producing them.
We have endeavoured to show how the moisture evaporated at the equator is distributed
over the globe. From experience we have learned that this distribution is both erratic and
uneven, and it is believed it ever will be so.
External
Influence on
the Weather,
FiCt us endeavour to reason it out. As a starting point, suppose a rigid
cycle to have been discovered, which, by the way, would only be possible
provided the atmosphere were for all time in perfect equilibrium. This
equilibrium would be upset or partially disturbed by both internal and
external influences. For instance, the recent unusual solar magnetic activity
which disorganised the telegraphic service in France must have exercised a momentous
influence also upon the atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions follow no cycle ; as far as is known
they may occur at any time. Now dust, both earthly and cosmic, play important functions
in relation to rain; so that the sudden discharge of this element into the atmosphere might
upset its normal state for a prolonged period and over a greater portion of the globe, for
volcanic dust is known to have been suspended in the air for many months after notable
eruptions, and to have been carried right round the world. The same disturbing effects
apply to the absorption of an abnormal quantity of meteorites by the atmosphere. The
liberation of Arctic and Antarctic ice floes would also be a disturbing element. Coming to
simpler problems, we have seen how man has influenced climate. Take for example the fog
of Loudon, which is solely caused by the smoke particles discharged from a million chimneys
attaching themselves to the water spherules already present, and visible as ordinary or white fog.

Our Rain

WOOL ON THE ROAD TO MARKET IN THE WEST.
l/ct us not delude ourselves with the idea that our rain and climate are
peculiarly uncertain. Let it be understood that they are not more so than
those of other countries. In fact, if anything, they are too generous. Let us
be more provident and less speculative. Kood and water may be husbanded
occasionally unnecessarily, but our history tells us that such provision is
absolutely necessary. The superabundance of grass, herbage and water in good seasons, if
conserved, will carry us over a succession of bad ones sooner or later, and although at times it
may appear a waste of labour and money in so doing, consider the reserve of wealth we shall
have stored away ; and also remember that, should we not want the fodder ourselves, the
vagaries of seasons in other parts of the world may make a lucrative opening for export. In
climates such as those of Europe, parts of Asia, and North America, the harvesting of crops
for fodder has to be undertaken every year, so that the stock may be kept alive during the
winter months, when the ground is covered with snow, a season when the soil is resting and
regaining its spent fertility. Let us look upon droughts as blessings rather than as draw-
backs, as a wise provision of nature to enable the soil to accumulate by decomposition of
matter and absorption from the air those properties which have been exhausted during a
succession of bountiful seasons.


Rainfall
evenly
distributed.
We hear much said about the disparity of rainfall in New South Wales,
but, as a matter of fact, it is very evenly distributed when compared with
that of other countries. We have an annual average of from 40 to 60
inches on the coast, gradually tailing off to 8 or 9 inches with remarkable
uniformity in the extreme west, and although the greater half falls during
the first six months of the year, the average for the last six months is well represented, and
is very little short of the more favoured period. Compared with American rainfalls, we find
that on the Atlantic coast they frequently exceed 100 inches annually, while probably the
smallest rainfalls in the world occur in South-eastern California and Western Arizona, in and
near the valley of lower Colorado, and in the section known as the Mohara Desert, where the
annual rainfall amounts to less than three
inches; Yuma, Arizona, only has 2’Bl
inches; Bishop’s Creek, Inyo, County
Cal., 202 inches ; Indio San Diego, 192
inches; Mammoth Tank, LBB inches only;
Camp Mohara, Arizona, LB5 inches.
These last two stations doubtless have the
smallest known rainfall on the face of the
globe. In Indio during the season 1884
to 1885, only 10 points were recorded
for the year. Along the Pacific slopes
statistics show a disparity in rainfalls of
12 inches at San Diego to 24 inches at
San Francisco, and again to 105 inches
at Neah Bay.
Coming to Europe we find that in
parts of Spain a total as low as 6 inches
has been recorded for the twelve months.
BIELSDOWN WATERFALL, NORTH COAST DISTRICT.
Fn Asia, Aden, during a four years' average, only had 2 - 36 inches. Leh, Ladakh, adjoining
Thibet, has a mean of 2’62 inches. From these figures it will be seen that the rain is not
unduly capricious in New South Wales, but we are, in contrast with other countries,
decidedly blessed.
Relation of
Climate to
Physiographical
Features.
Physiographical features of a country, and the distribution of land and
water, have an intimate bearing upon the climate of all lands, and where
extreme features exist, there we look for extremes in the climatic elements;
thus in North America devasting winter blizzards alternating with disastrous
summer heat waves are but natural concomitants. The continent of
Australia on the other hand is comparatively flat, the only conspicuous
mountains being the range of moderate elevation running along the eastern littoral. It is
ideal in shape, and its shores are broken to a minimum degree, which, in itself, is evidence


of the general peacefulness of the climatic elements. It is so geographically distributed,
too, that the major portion of its area of 3,000,000 square miles of country is situated in
temperate latitudes, neither intruding too closely into equatorial latitudes in its northern parts,
nor approaching inconveniently close to the cold parallels, and withal New South Wales
enjoys the happy geographical medium.
The wind affects the good or bad results of a season to a considerable
extent. The rainfalls may be good and above the average, but should they
be followed by dry westerly winds the moisture is evaporated and carried
away to sea, while without these hungry winds, and with moderate rains, should
they fall opportunely, a season will be good : hence it is necessary to protect

cattle from death by starvation. The wholesale destruction of trees in India and other parts
of the world has had the most deteriorating effects on the climates, so that on no account
should our trees be unnecessarily destroyed.
Apart from the above important influences which they exercise, forests con-
siderably reduce the mean temperature of the air, especially during the warmer
portion of the year. They prevent the occurrence of high temperature by
shading the ground, by increasing the surface from which radiation takes
place, by the active radiating power of the leaves, and by the frequent
