PRAYER FOR THE MORNING OF A SABBATH DAY.
Most holy and blessed God. thou art the maker of all things In heaven and
earth: and thou madeat me for thy glory and service. Lord, help me to remember
thee, my Creator, in the days of my youth. I confess, that, by nature, lam a child
of wrath, and an heir of hell; my heart is backward to that which is good, and
'wholly inclined to that which is evil. God be merciful to me a sinner.
0 Lord, if thou hadst not provided a Saviour for me, I had been lost and undone
for ever. Lord, deliver me from the wrath to come, for the sake of Jesus Christ
thy Son, who laid down his life to save such lost sinners as I am.
Create in me a clean heart, 0 God, and renew a right spirit within me: Lord,
take away my hard and stony heart, and give me a soft and broken heart for sin.
0 forgive all my sins, original and actual; and wash them all away in the blood
of Christ my Saviour, that cleanseth from all sin. O Lord, preserve me continually
from the snares of sin and temptations of the devil. Lord, give me grace to love
thee with all my heart, to mention thy name still with reverence, to keep thy
Sabbath with delight, and hear thy word with attention.
Lord, bless all my relations, and especially my parents; God make me a dutiful
child to them.
1 thank thee for taking care of me this last night: Lord, watch over me through
this thy holy day, and all the days of my life, and bring me to heaven at last, that
1 may dwell with thee, see thy face, and sing thy praise for evermore: for Jesus
Christ’s sake. Amen.


PRAYER FOR THE EVENING OF A SABBATH DAY.
Most blessed and glorious God, thou hast brought me in safety to the close of
this holy day, and hast bestowed many mercies upon me. What shall I render
unto thee for all thy benefits? And especially for thy love in sending thy Son
Jesus Christ, to redeem perishing sinners. Thanks be unto God for his unspeak-
able gift.
Lord, work in me repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus
Christ. 0 make me one of Christ’s disciples, instructed by his precepts, ran-
somed by his blood, and inclined to follow his example and walk in his steps.
Lord, give me the spirit of adoption, that I may cry. Abba, Father, and look up
to thee with confidence, as my Father in heaven, for the supply of all my wants.
O make me a wise and obedient child, and cause me to grow in grace, as I grow in
days and years, that I may prove a blessing and comfort to my parents and rela-
tions on earth.
Lord, bless my parents, and be a Friend to all my friends, and forgive mine
enemies. Lord, watch over the whole family, and keep us through the night, and
let me lie down in a reconciled state with God. Lord, fit me for death, and pre-
pare a mansion for ray soul in heaven, where I may eternally rest with thee, and
sing Hallelujahs to Him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever-
more. To God the Father, Sou, and Holy Ghost, be glory both now and for ever.
Amen.
PRAYER FOR THE MORNING OF A WEEK DAY.
Most gracious God, thou didst form me in the womb, and took me safely from
it; thou hast provided for me ever since, and kept me in many dangers. I was
early given up to thee in baptism; Lord, own me as thine, and grant me a portion
among thy children.
Lord, thou hast encouraged little children to come unto thee, and said, “Of
such is the kingdom of God.” 0 take me up in the arms of thy protection, and
put thy hands of mercy upon me, and bless me. 0 give me a new heart and a new
nature ; and let Christ be formed in my soul.
Lord, keep me from all those sins and snares that children are liable to; and
preserve me from speaking ill words, or keeping ill company, but let me be a com-
panion to them that fear thee. Lord, help me to keen in mind my baptismal
engagements, that I may renounce the world, the devil, and the flesh, and still
watch against them.
O Lord, I bless thee for sparing my life, and preserving me through the darkness
of the past night. Lord, guide me through this day, and help me always to mind
that thy All-seeing eye is still upon me. Do thou graciously pardon all niy sins,
and hear my prayers, for the sake and mercies of my blessed Lord and Saviour,
Jesus Christ. Amen.
PRAYER FOR THE EVENING OF A WEEK DAY.
Most gracious and blessed God, I am thy creature, the workmanship of thy
hands, and lam fearfully and wonderfully made; but alas! I have mismade and
deformed myself by sin. Lord, have mercy upon me, a miserable sinner.
0 Lord, give me grace to know, love, and serve thee, with all my heart, mind,
and strength. O teach me to follow my Saviour, that I may deny all ungodliness
and worldly lusts, and live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.
May I, like Jesus, increase daily in wisdom and stature, and in favour both with
God and man, ,
Lord, be thou a Father unto me; lead me in the way that I should walk, and
grant that, from my childhood, I may know the Holy Scriptures. Lord, bless my
parents, and all my relations; enable me to do my duty to them, and them to do
their duty to me. Do thou preserve me through the silent watches of the night;
keep me from the roaring Lion, that goes about night ami day, seeking whom he
may devour. Lord, prepare me to die, and bring me to thy everlasting kingdom,
that I may be ever with the Lord, for the sake of Jesus Christ, who, with thee,
O Father, and the Holy Spirit, b!eeae4_f or ever. Amen.
